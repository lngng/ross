          "description": "Hello friends! Next week I’m travelling to Vietnam with my mother and we’ll be staying there for three weeks. Last time I went to Vietnam was in 2015 so I’m pretty excited. \n We’ll be spending the first week in Saigon, second week at my grandparents to celebrate Tet, and the third week in Phu Quoc Island. \n There is one thing I’m worried about and that’s losing my phone. I’m worried about getting it stolen while in Saigon. It’s pretty crowded there so I’m a bit paranoid. \n My phone is super important to me so I don’t wanna lose it. I’ll be wearing a fanny pack and I want to take a lot of photos and record videos while I’m there. \n That’s also the problem. What if someone walks past me and snatches my phone while I’m recording? Or if someone on a motorcycle drives by and snatches it.\n When I was in Vietnam in 2015, I was just a child so I didn’t have a phone at the time so there was nothing to worry about. Anyone got some advice? What should I think about? \n I’d also appreciate suggestions on nice restaurants and places to visit!\n    submitted by    /u/Tooonyyyy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The reasons why is that I want to become more fluent in Vietnamese (my skills are okay; I can say basic stuff but they aren't great) and have the experience of living in Viet Nam. I do plan to travel to Viet Nam for a month before all of this. I also want to have experience with living in other countries. \n I am not sure if I am delusional so please tell me if I am.

I will be based in Hanoi and ideally looking for day trip, or out of town 2-4 days then ilback to Hanoi. \n I was born and grew up in the Old Quarter of Hanoi but have been living oversea since 19yo. I still have many friends and family in Vietnam. I just visited Vietnam end of last year so have catched up on most family/friends and gatherings. I also realized my recreational interests have changed now (probably due to age and living in NZ) and more into activities such as town/market walk around, hiking, walking track, cultural experience...my friends in VN will just take me to a cool cafe or new restaurant everytime and i have started to feel I have enough of it. \n So if you are like-minded, I would love to hear from you.\n    submitted by    /u/babu0205  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tonight I just received a message that this year it would be 15.4%, up from 12.9 from last year. I don't have the contract right now but I will check later to see if this is even legal. I remember there maybe some thing like maximum increment of 2% a year. The bank is TPB btw.\n Is this a normal thing? Is the rate too high for current market? Is there anything I should do?\n Update: thank you everyone, this looks like a market thing. I hope everyone is doing well financially.

As a foodie, I'm fascinated with all the food shops, restaurants, stalls in Hanoi. I noticed that most of the restaurants are generally 100% women-lead from cooking to servicing and to billing. Why? The rare exception I noticed so far are restaurants 100% ruled and managed by men, and these are thai-ish food related and generally by stylish men. Is there any sort of explanation?

This time we would like to spend more time, so we would like to go in smaller steps to see more places. It seems the usual way to travel is by bus. How does the bus system work in general and after Covid? Is there one public transportation system or are there also privat companies. Would you also take taxies into account? When should we use which kind of transportation? Our route currently looks like the following:\n Sài Gòn -> Mỹ Tho -> Cần Thơ -> Sài Gòn -> Phan Thiết and Phan Rang <-> Đà Lạt <-> Buôn Ma Thuột -> Tuy Hòa -> Quy Nhơn -> Pleiku -> Kon Tum -> Hôi An and Đà Nẵng (<-> denotes that the order is not yet decided)\n Our plan is to take the train where applicable.\n Though, this is only the first half of our route as we would like to continue our route to Hà Nội in a similar style for another 30 days, but we have not looked into it too much yet. We hope this is a reasonable route to travel.\n    submitted by    /u/dagobahwarrior  \n [link]   [comments]",

Along with a large crowd, we waited for the midnight fireworks to start. \n And waited... and waited... and waited...\n At 12:20, we gave up and took the kids back to the apartment. When we got back, I turned on the TV and loaded the live stream of the Saigon fireworks. Nothing but streams of people leaving the riverside.\n When I got up this morning, I checked the local news, hoping to find an explanation. One news site, VN Express, had a glowing report of the festivities in HCMC along with photos of the \"fireworks display\":\n Vietnam rings in 2023\n This was the only reference I could find, so I've started the new year off with a mystery.\n    submitted by    /u/PiscadorII  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the main difference is the apparent tolerance of the state/authorities to informal businesses, eg street food. Are informal small business tolerated or encouraged ? Is there any form of corruption involved? How does the state collect taxes ? What is the size of the grey economy? How important is a business registration? \n \nMost restaurants, even small and apparently informal ones, have a PoS management software, and many print a receipt. I often see small business managers using calculators and apparently doing their accounting. Similar restaurants/business in my country usually don't even have a logbook (combination of illiteracy and bad management). I know that Vietnam mostly got rid of illiteracy decades ago, but I feel that there's more to this than just knowing how to read and write.\n \nI mostly think of the vietnamese as one of the most industrious people on the planet. But on rare occasions, i meet people that seem even lazier than my countrymen, usually the younger ones. Especially in cafés, waiters seem incredibly slow and unprofessional. What's happening here ?

I heard that it is not worth shopping for global brands so I am more interested in shopping locally. \n The style I am looking for is casual loungewear/active wear, but looking for thick/plush materials that would not pill, fade, and is soft. I typically avoid any loud patterns or colors and enjoy more neutrals. Brands that I think of as an example of the style I am going for is PANGAIA, Gymshark, Alphalete, etc.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/BeneficialMastodon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I saw that drones with cameras aren't allowed but I've seen footage in air of Vietnam?

          "description": "Recently an American ESL teacher based in Saigon took to social platforms to expose the truth about the rampant sexual harrasment in a Vietnamese High School (Nguyen Thi Dieu).\n 1/Upon seeing a female highschooler being forced to remove her jacket and inappropriately touched by a security guard at school, Teacher Kenny apparently stood up for her by using physical force against the guard. Kenny was furious and was asking for an investigation as this has happened numerous times before with other students. \n 2/There is CCTV footage documenting the guard being inapproprate with students in his office : forcing them to undress to check their nametag, inappropriate touching and groping female students. The school board forced everyone to stay silent and threatened to destroy Kenny's teaching career in Saigon if he went on to draw attention to the case. The guard, on the other hand, only got off with a warning. \n 3/Teacher Kenny has since spoken up about the incident on many social sites such as Tiktok and Facebook, students who are former victims of harrassment by the guard are also speaking up and trying to gain traction for the case.\n 4/The Vietnamese English teacher, however, is bribing students with exam points if they stay silent or inform her about the ones who side with Kenny on social media. She called students \"stupid\" for siding with a \"white westerner\", threatened various UNDERAGE students for making tiktoks defending the victims and teachers. An adult woman who is an educator is going around spreading racism and threatening minors.\n Here's a link to Kenny's tiktok : https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS86jpE2w/\n Facebook : Kenneth Goins\n    submitted by    /u/Normie-Chloe22  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I will be traveling to VietNam early next year. I have a severe seafood (more so finned fish, but contamination is a concern) and brazil nut allergy and I was hoping to get some insight into how I would communicate that in Vietnamese if I need to.\n I looked it up through Google Translate, but I find that it is often not very accurate. If anyone has any advice on pronunciation that would be helpful too, as I find that more difficult as a native English speaker.\n I'm not sure how to phrase it best either, so if anyone has advice regarding that it would be great. I am thinking it would be best to keep it simple, just something like \"No seafood/brazil nuts, I die\" or \"I will die\".\n So far something I have thought of trying is to print out an allergy card with the information on it, but I think it may be good to get other suggestions as well. \n Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/makeshiftswift  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone! I was wondering if anyone has tried the fried chicken at Lotteria in Vietnam and what your thoughts were on it. Personally, I've tried all the big international chains like KFC, Popeyes, and Jollibee, and I have to say that none of them hold a candle to the deliciousness of Lotteria's fried chicken.\n The chicken at Lotteria is always fresh and tender, and the marinade they use is just the right balance of herbs and spices. Plus, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. In comparison, the chicken at the other fast food chains I've tried has been either dry or cold, or both. It's just not the same level of quality as what you'll find at Lotteria.\n Now, I will admit that the rest of the menu at Lotteria leaves something to be desired. The sides are pretty mediocre and the sandwiches and burgers are just okay. And the desserts? Well, let's just say they're not exactly worth writing home about. But despite all that, the chicken at Lotteria is still worth the visit (or delivery) in my opinion.\n So I'm curious to hear what others think - have you tried the fried chicken at Lotteria? What were your thoughts? Is it worth the visit (or delivery)? And if anyone knows of a better fried chicken place in Vietnam, I'd love to hear about it!\n    submitted by    /u/DragonXDT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I live in a smallish town in the South, I am a foreigner and my wife is Vietnamese. I'm pretty embedded in my family and local community and I know that people prefer to handle things \"in house\" or without the police a lot, but I'm just at a loss.\n The house directly behind ours (their back wall forms the wall of our yard) has a woman who is an absolutely insane and abusive nutcase to her very small child, or maybe children I'm not sure. She screams like a lunatic and hits the poor child, which makes it wail this horrific wail I can't take anymore. It's honestly shameful I haven't done anything yet but I just haven't known what to do and everyone here has a very \"mind your own business\" attitude so I don't know who to turn to.\n Last week I was afraid that I was listening to her actually killing her child. There was a pained screaming that only comes from death, and then it suddenly cut off to total silence. I remember though that lately I'd heard a puppy, I think she killed the puppy in front of the child. I heard the child sobbing.\n Who do I contact, what branch of government handles investigations like this? Besides the absolutely over the top regular abuse, I feel like if she really did kill that puppy in front of the kid(s) she may one day kill them too. I don't know, I think maybe she has some really intense post-partum psychosis. Due to the layout of the neighborhood I've never actually seen any of them and I don't know what the front of their house looks like.\n I'm very worried and I am at the point that I can't let my moral cowardice get in the way any longer, something needs to be done.\n Can any Vietnamese people here help me? My wife doesn't hear it because she's rarely in the back yard and while she's normally a very lovely person, I don't think she's taking it seriously and may be worried about social blowback.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Dung_Buffalo  \n [link]   [comments]",

We want to fit in Ha Giang/Sapa, Ninh Binh, Halong Bay, and Hanoi in but the issue is 10 days is a little tight.\n What do you guys think about the 4 day/3 night option vs 3 day/2 nights for Ha Giang Loop? Is it too rushed to do the 3 day option on QT's website? It allows us to fit Ninh Binh and Halong Bay in a bit easier but I'm a little worried that it'll be too rushed to enjoy the loop.\n The other option is to do Sapa instead of the Ha Giang loop which will definitely make the itinerary easier since I think you can definitely fit Sapa in 3 day/2 nights in very easily.\n Thoughts?

          "description": "We are staying in Hồ Tràm for holidays, in a big tourist resort. On a Christmas eve Turkey dinner, there was a big group of people, who were (almost)all wearing white fancy clothes: most of them young and adult ladies but some men, children and at least one old lady. They were almost all wearing white fancy clothes: dresses, lacy shirts etc. Except the old woman was wearing something red & some men had jeans or black trousers. They were also playing some games or giving speeches or something.\n In my culture white fancy clothes are usually something a bridal party wears, or on some other special occasion if everyone is wearing them in unison. I was wondering if this is a cultural thing for a special occasion, as they all looked more Asian than Caucasian, and asked our waiter, what was the occasion end gestured in their general direction (I think I did it discreetly) and our waiter was immediately super apologetic and kept repeating \"I'm so sorry\" and we were super confused, saying \"no need to apologize, it's fine\" etc. and we never got an answer, what was the occasion, and we were left in confusion.\n My SO was giving me shit afterwards for asking it. I never intended it to be anything hurtful or insulting, as they were in high spirits and I think it is okay in many cultures to ask simply \"what's the occasion\" when you see a group or family celebrating. \n So if someone could guess what was the occasion and also tell me if I was an insensitive white biach.\n    submitted by    /u/hipunen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "You may be surprised to know Vietnam has a wonderful cosplay community. There are several groups that organize events year round (usually 1-2 events every month). Currently, there is a Winter Convention Manga Festival going on; it was today and it will also be going on tomorrow too! \n If you are into anime, manga, comics, and cosplay, then you should absolutely check these events out. I have been going to every event for the last 5 months or so. I film short videos (3-5 minutes) showing the cosplayers. I let them do a pose/action for about 5 seconds and show as many as I can. \n You can find the cosplay festival videos by searching YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I have a \"Cosplay!\" playlist from all the events. If you see me there, I am always happy to include you in my videos if you want to be in one. I do it to showcase the cosplay community and let others know about this community in Vietnam. All the people who go are very kind and friendly. Those of us that dress up always allow people to take photos and videos. \n Entry fees for most of the events is around 120,000 VND. Hope to see more new cosplayers in the near future. If you have any questions, just let me know!\n    submitted by    /u/SaigonSterling  \n [link]   [comments]",

The country is beautiful, the food and culture are amazing, and I’ve found the people to be the best part of all - extremely gracious, respectful, and hospitable.\n But then I came to Hanoi. And I’m baffled. We had a bus driver sneezing and coughing up phlegm, spitting it into a cup, for the entirety of a three hour bus ride, there and back, without a mask. This morning, we were in a lovely coffee shop. But the girl sitting across from us, working on her laptop, was sneezing uncontrollably and coughing terribly. She was clearly not just under the weather, but very sick. Again, she was not wearing a mask. I made eye contact with a perplexed look on my face and she looked back as though I was the one in the wrong. \n And then a cab just now. The driver coughing every 10 seconds for a 20 minute ride. No mask. \n I know people here wear masks. More than half of the people on motorbikes have them on. What are they for? Do people in Hanoi use them just for pollution? When we were in other cities (Saigon, Hoi An, Ninh Binh, Mai Chau) I saw plenty of people wearing masks inside, and none of the kind of blantant illness that is in Hanoi.\n I’m terribly sorry if this comes off as culturally insensitive. I promise I don’t intend it to be. But coming from the West and other parts of Vietnam, and particularly in a post-Covid world, I’m really perplexed - what is going on in Hanoi?\n    submitted by    /u/goaliebloak  \n [link]   [comments]",

I asked a friend to extract the wire transfer information from the bill (see attached image) but it seems to be missing some info and I know wire transfers can go bad if you get the slightest detail wrong. There's a QR code, but it wouldn't scan for me. At the very bottom of the bill it mentions \"Payoo\" which appears to be a payment app. Would anybody be so kind as to look at this bill and decipher for me how to pay it? I have Venmo and PayPal.

I really see living in Vietnam as a lifetime experience for the whole family but I must admit we are getting tired with Saigon, in particular:\n - air pollution\n - noise\n Things we do like here:\n - green area in D7\n - great English run preschool\n - good eating and services availability \n As I can work remotely, coming to office not very frequently, moving somewhere else is an option. I need to fly to SEA countries occasionally, trips to China and Japan can happen too. English preschool is important as our kid is just learning English :)\n Danang looks good for those reasons:\n - no air pollution\n - access to beach, proximity to other nature attractions\n - less busy, less traffic\n We have been only once, actually going to Hoi An. I would plan going there for a month or so, closed to end of lease of our apartment in HCMC.\n ​\n To the point. I am curious of opinions/experiences of other people that have done this move, or have been considering it and dropped the idea (why).

If I send $100 USD and it converts to about 2,300,000. \n For Vietnamese people does this translate to about 2,300 dollars? \n That's like here in the US, someone depositing $2,300 into my bank and having enough to buy a older used car. I would think it is equivalent to $230 dollars for you and something that can hold you off for a short amount of time spending-wise, otherwise shouldn't 2,300 lasts a much long time? \n It seems as though the family in Vietnam spends the money pretty quickly or need to ask for asistance often. So another question would be: Is the cost of living in VN pretty high for locals? I know for us Viet Kieu it's very livable and considered cheap but im hearing a family member said his daughter ate a bowl of Pho for 50,000 and one time 90,000VND. If Vietnam money starts at 1,000 and that is like $1 dollar here in US, that's like me going out to buy a bowl of Pho for $50 - 100 usd which is unheard of. \n So I've been looking for answers on google about this but have not found a clear answer so I am hoping you all can shed some light on this. \n thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Latter-Project536  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am currently in the process of applying for a job in Vietnam. I've been offered a position in Ho Chi Minh City with VUS. I see reviews on glassdoor are generally good, but that's the average of all reviews, and things could clearly have changed post-pandemic, so that's why I'm here asking. I've done teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, and the experience I had with them was very different from how VUS is doing things so far with me. To be honest, it comes off as sketchy at times and makes me suspicious.\n I'll be honest, I'm actually quite confused at points. I was offered a job, but when asked to see an actual written contract with terms, conditions, duties, etc., I was told that I would only see a contract after I've landed in Vietnam. Agreeing to take a job on the other side of the world without having seen and signed an actual contract beforehand strikes me as super sketchy. When I took teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, they provided me with full-on, multi-page contracts to read and review before agreeing to fly halfway around the world.\n I also know that I'll be flown in on a business visa and do a probation period first for a month or two before acquiring a work permit and then a resident permit from there. Once again, this also confuses me. I've never had to do a probation period before when agreeing to do a job overseas, and the whole \"applying for a 3-month business visa, then a work permit\" thing instead of \"applying for a work visa from the get-go\" thing also confuses me.\n Lastly, aside from all that, how has your experience been with VUS? How was the teaching and prep workload? How were employer-employee relations overall? Was the pay sufficient to save (aiming for $500 a month if I can) and could hours be picked up easily? If on a part-time contract, was it easy to take vacation days (even if unpaid)? \n Any and all input is welcome. Thank you very much in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/bacharama  \n [link]   [comments]",

All the advice we read beforehand was about metered taxis, and the guy said that the taxi is metered so we didn’t think anything more of it so it should be fine. Hopped in and asked to be dropped to our hotel in District 1. \n No joke… the meter was going up 25k every 10 seconds. After less than 10 mins of driving, we told him it’s far too expensive and we need to get out. Paid 600k to be left on the side of the road :( wish we’d stuck to our guns and given him less, he made a stupid amount off our naïveté. \n We ordered a Grab which dropped us the rest of the way for just 80k. In hindsight that’s what we should’ve done when we were looking for a taxi, but hindsight is always 20/20!\n    submitted by    /u/sam0sa94  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’d love to have a scientific job there such as medical research, but I’ve done quite a bit of looking into this and can’t seem to find many opportunities, so I would probably go into teaching english.\n I lived in Saigon for about 6 months in 2020 with my now ex-gf, and I really loved it, and ever since have been a little obsessed with watching videos about it, keeping up with news/info there. My friends and family know I love it as I do speak about it with them sometimes.\n The problem is, while I was living there, I wasn’t actually working, so it was more of an extended holiday, and I know actually working there would be much different. I have a TEFL certificate and also a bachelors degree, and actually had an interview a while ago when I was considering moving there a year ago, and was offered a teaching job, but in the end I declined it.\n Only things that are stopping me are leaving my great friends and family here, learning to ride a bike there is a bit daunting (never driven one before), and maybe regretting my decision after taking the leap. \n I am considering taking another holiday there for around a month and just kind of acting like I l live and work there, just to test it out, but not sure how useful that actually is.\n Anyway, if you have any thoughts on this let me know! And if you know of any medical science jobs there that a British person with a science degree could get into, please tell me (although I may make a separate post about this)!\n    submitted by    /u/ijintheuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Several days ago, I have read two articles that are critical about Vinfast.\n VinFast VF8 Is Simply Not Ready for America (jalopnik.com) \n 180 Miles for $55k: Can the 2023 VinFast VF 8 SUV Break Into America? (motortrend.com) \n From what I have found out, the Vinfast VF 8 would cost at least $55k (Eco starts at $59k according to their site), and that the City Edition would only have 180 miles of range, which is a joke considering that most EVs have between 200-350 miles of range. The fact that the Vinfast name is weak compared to other brands like Tesla, Polestar, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, Ford, GM, Mercedes Benz, BMW, VW/Audi/Porsche, etc. won't do it any favours either.\n In the US, with other EVs that are more competitive like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Hyundai Kona EV, Kia EV6, Kia Niro EV, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Polestar 2, BMW i4, Mercedes Benz EQB, Audi Q4 E-tron, VW ID.4, Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and the Tesla Model 3 (even its starting price now at $47k puts it at a better position than the VF 8, and that is after massive price hikes as the April 2021 price of the Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive sits below $40k), would Vinfast succeed or would they end up failing like Yugo (at least Yugos are cheap)?\n Also, how was the experience of Vinfast cars and EVs in Vietnam? Were they good or were they bad?\n    submitted by    /u/MussleGeeYem  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to be independent and not have to rely on others for me to legally stay in vietnam. \n I do have some family members in Sagion/Bao Loc but I am not very close to them. I can also speak basic vietnamese, as in I can navigate daily life but when it comes to reading gov't documents and speaking on important matters I am not at that level yet.

I am not installing solar panels, just batteries that are charged by electricity when available. \"Pin tích điện\" is the Vietnamese keyword I can use without being pointed to \"ắc quy\" or \"pin sạc\" (which won't have enough wattage). Can you please recommend a good source? What is the general price for my requirements below? In the long run is it cheaper than a generator? Is there a reason most people just use generators that I am not aware of?\n We won't be cooking but an aircon is required for at least 3-4 hours for our toddler (also one reason I prefer battery over generator is due to the noise). I would like to run a fan, watch TV or use my laptop if possible. There is a fridge, would be nice if I can keep it running but we always keep it cold the day before anyway so maybe running it for an hour only mid-day won't hurt.\n    submitted by    /u/datvm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've read a lot about people who've jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge (one of the world's most frequent suicide locations) and one quote has stuck with me:\n Ken Baldwin jumped from the bridge many years ago, in 1985 (a two-hundred-foot fall that statistically leads to death 97% of the time), but the instant he did so, in midair, he was hit by a horrifying realization: \"I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was in fact totally fixable - except for having just jumped.\"\n With that sudden desire to live, Baldwin managed to change his body posture just before impact so that he hit the water feet-first rather than head-first (which would have meant certain death.) Even hitting feet-first, the only possible survivable posture, he still suffered numerous, severe injuries to his body. But he did survive, and went on to tell the tale and live a transformed life.\n If you are ever suicidal, for whatever reason, please take his words to heart - whatever you may feel in your life is \"unfixable\", may in fact be totally fixable or something that can be lived with. Don't wait until you're in mid-air after having leapt from a building or bridge to come to that realization.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/rs66fz3j3o6a1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=943e3b1449852d757d909e621044ca4a3720971e\n    submitted by    /u/chudayroi  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the time of my birth, my dad was an Australian citizen (so I got Australian citizenship automatically) and my mum was a Vietnamese citizen. My mum has Australian citizenship now but she never gave up her VN citizenship (not sure if she automatically lost it).\n I currently have my mum’s birth certificate, national ID (CMND) from the 80s, and old VN passport from the 90s (expired). Would this be enough for me to apply for my first VN passport? Any other Australians went through the same process?\n Asking my mum to renew her passport is completely out of the question so I’d like to know if I can do this myself lol.\n I’ll call the consulate in Sydney some time but just wanted to hear from others first. 😊\n    submitted by    /u/GullibleSwordfish70  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I order it with no ice, no sugar. Why?\n For a couple of reasons, it’s faster for the employees to make, and I like my coffee black. Anywho, the coffee only cost 12k. I noticed, that the first few times I had ordered my coffee, some of the clerks would fill it a little less than half of the cup. Now! That I have consistently go there everyday, I get the best coffee around town. O don’t even need to tell them my order, instead the clerk would automatically ask me, “black? No ice, no sugar?” I love it! Plus, this time comes around there’s this clerk that just doesn’t care about the amount he gives me. The dude fills it to the brink. Kudos to him!

I also always call them by their name or nickname, unless it's someone I'm not that familiar with.\n ​\n It's kind of like insisting on calling someone \"Doctor\" or \"Sir\" after they've already allowed you to call them by name, like they want to keep the relationship distant to less than acquaintances, which is fine if that's what they want, I won't have to join their drinking sessions anymore haha.\n ​\n Is this normal in vietnam? I have a vietnamese friend that says in their language they just call each other by name, but when I discuss it with the teachers they say they are just being \"polite\" in their culture. I even told them I prefer to be called by my name and they still say, \"hello Teacher.\"\n    submitted by    /u/Vivoras  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, \n 8 days ago, I began catching online predators in Vietnam. I have 3 catches already. Yesterday, I caught my first teacher. That didn't take long. This guy was an English Teacher at an international school here in Vietnam. \n He was immediately fired from his school, his apartment was contacted and they notified police immediately. He is losing his work permit. His embassy is aware of the situation. \n It is very scary to think there are teachers out there trying to meet up with kids for pleasures. Thankfully, he met me instead of a kid and I reported ALL INFORMATION to proper authorities. \n You can watch the catch on YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I will continue to do my part to protect the community and children in Vietnam. \n I know some of you were skeptical about my original post when I said I was going to do this. 3 catches in 8 days is the results so far. Again, all evidence against each predator is always submitted to local authorities, employers, family members, embassies and whomever else may need it. That is all I can do on my end. \n Much love to all of you! Thanks for your time. Will continue to update the community when new catches come out as you may know this person. Share, share, share and make others aware of these guys.\n    submitted by    /u/SaigonSterling  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do we bring cash and try to exchange it instead? What is the best move? \n As i understand, she will be able to open a bank account there once she has her work visa done. With that said, we will have substantial spending for first month and she won't get paid until the end of the month (finding apartment, 2 months deposit plus first months rent, food, necessities etc). I am thinking we need to bring enough USD cash with us otherwise we will get destroyed with foreign exchange fees? I also read there are limits on daily withdrawals? Is it feasible to bring USD and exchange it at gold shops? Is there a limit how much they will exchange? What about airports?\n ​\n Any advice or ideas would be appreciated it.\n ​\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Yukzor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had learned through online resources the way you hi to people is “Xin chào” for formal and just “chào” for informal. I took Spanish the last two years of school and had learned to use “usted” to say “you” formally to people older than you or to higher-ups, so I assumed I would use “Xin chào” to greet my family. When my dad picks me up from school, I began to greet him with “Xin chào,” but recently he told me I would actually say “Con chào ba” to greet him or anyone else (pronouns changing depending on person). I was curious if that was a regional thing (my dad is from south vietnam but my bà nội is from north vietnam/south china) or if that’s a general thing among all vietnamese people?\n    submitted by    /u/LittleStar385  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can buy food, deal with money, understand classroom commands etc. Obviously, I'm a teacher. I also generally can understand what topic people are talking about, but not what they're saying, if that makes sense.\n My issue with Duolingo is that I like knowing what I'm learning, not just guessing. As in, I'd like to know the grammar rules and stuff. I know not everyone learns that way, but I quite like to learn theoretically! This will be my fourth language to learn, so I feel like I have an idea of how I best learn. (I am not fluent in my third, but have learnt enough to get by in simple situations, which is kind of what I'm aiming for here).\n I am thinking of asking one of the Vietnamese teachers I work with for a lesson once a week but my schedule doesn't allow time for much more. Self study would be ideal for me, especially reading, grammar and vocab. I have lots of short pockets of time to kill between lessons. I have a handle on most of the tones, but that's what I would focus on with an in person teacher (tones, pronunciation etc).\n Any resources to recommend?
