After that, I got interested in vietnamese culture, the food, the language, the music. I listened to popular vietnamese songs on Youtube. Not the oldschool, historically famous ones. More like the hits of the last few years.\n ​\n I remember listening to one song in particular and I just can't find it anymore. It wasnt the best song or anything, but it bugs me because I can see the video clip in my head and it's frustrating. Here is what I know about it : \n  \nThe main singer was a man \n It was released before the end of 2019\n The clip is at night, in a big city. A man and a woman are having fun, getting drunk, playing pool. And there's an underlying love story\n I think he's hoping something happens betweem them \n I think it was rap. But maybe not 100% rap ? \n  \nI know it's not much... But if it rings a bell to anyone, it would make my day and remind me great memories !

          "description": "So me and my partner were walking in some park in HCMC and a guy appeared from nowhere and started pointing at my partner’s shoe. We didn’t understand what he meant so he came closer and took out a funny brush from his “shoe repair and maintenance box” and started quickly washing my bf’s shoes. We both said “No” about five times and soon there was another guy attacking my shoes. They basically took of our shoes from our feet - pretended to wash them with their super duper chemicals and glued an extra heel on my bf’s Birkenstock sandals (which of course came off after a few days and looks hilarious). After finishing their grand hard work of one minute they asked us 500.000 dongs from each of us (~40 euros in total). It’s not that I didn’t expect for them to ask money, I understood it from the very beginning but they were really good and quick in undressing us.. I gave them 500.000 (shouldn’t have) and they asked for another half. I literally showed them my wallet - I didn’t have that much. It is funny that they didn’t agree to take less than 500.000 - they were insisting on their price and I started finally showing my attitude, saying that we didn’t want their “service” in the first place and that we don’t have more money. So I told them let’s call the police. They didn’t like the idea and their hooligan leader took my bf’s shoe and threw it in the trash bin direction. We quickly vanished afterwards. So, our stupidity is not under a question mark - it was our first day in Vietnam, we were probably jetlagged and awed, and just fools. However, we indeed said “no” many many times and actually the next level would’ve been shouting, which we didn’t even consider and our politeness costed us 500000 dongs. My question is about the police - which side would’ve they taken? I assume this shoe business is illegal and we would’ve been right? But I saw so many people in forms in the city (I assume - policemen) - how come is their business still running?\n    submitted by    /u/JustabitLii  \n [link]   [comments]",

My partner has lived here since birth and his parents came here i think shortly after the war. They are both from northern Vietnam. I have only lived here for 4 years. I refer to them as bố and mẹ since I'm learning Vietnamese, and bố told me that since my partner and I are living together, it is the same as being married in Vietnam, and that it's fine for me to call them bố and mẹ since its normal to call your in-laws mom and dad, and this is also common in the culture that I grew up in. The issue/thing that is confusing me is that while neither have an issue with me calling them that, bố always responds for himself as bố , while mẹ switches between mẹ and cô. I only use simple vietnamese at the moment, but an example would be:I: khi nào bố sẽ đi làm ? B: bố đi làm lúc (time)\n Mẹ would use the same or respond with cô. Is this a regional or cultural thing, or is this because there is no blood relation? I don't think I have heard her use it with my partner or her daughter, but it oculd be that I missed it because I'm still learning the language. I also thought that it might be similar to how bạn, tôi is used as another exception pronoun.

I visited my wife’s family in HCMC and now I have dreams of coming to live there too. I, of course, would try to find our own place to live as I would never want to burden my wife’s family.\n However, when telling my wife’s family that I want to move there they continuously tell us never to move there. When asked if they would ever move to the USA they always say no because it is boring, dangerous, and they love the life they have in Vietnam. I don’t understand why someone would tell me not to live somewhere if they would not leave that place at the first opportunity. They live a great life in Vietnam and my wife’s brother is always taking trips to other nearby countries and buying expensive things as a flight attendant. \n I make a lot more money here in the USA, but with the rising cost of living and potential economic recession, I wish for a life that is much simpler. Am I wrong for wanting that? Am I wrong for thinking they might be hypocrites? Am I wrong for thinking I could have a much more comfortable life there?

I’m getting a motorbike so these places that are for 1 day are just stop overs with maybe ¾ of the day for exploring, hence the odd day calculations…just want to be realistic.\n In total the trip is 29 days long but ultimately wondering what people’s opinions are at the times in these locations? Am I spending too much/too little time in places or prioritizing the wrong places? The only thing set in stone is Ha Long Bay, I’ll need to be there by the 26th day. My hostel in HCMC is also booked but was $12/night so is a wash if things change.\n The trip is pretty linear so things to an extent can be cut and put other places. Would love folks opinions cause most things I read say everywhere is amazing and I don’t have all the time haha!\n (3.75 days) Days 1 to 5 Ho Chi Minh City\n *I originally had 3 days is this too much time at 4 days? Worried Jet lag will put me out of commission for the day, but I arrive around noon my first day\n (1.75 days) Day 5 to 7 Phan Thiet/Mui Ne\n *Should I take a day here and give it to Dalat? Should I skip?\n (.75 days) Day 7 to 8 Dalat\n (1.75 days) Day 8 to 10 Nha Trong\n (.75 days) Days 10 to 11 Quy Nhon\n *Could go straight to Pleiku but have heard good things about Quy Nhon?\n (.75 days) Days 11 to 12 Pleiku\n (2.75 days) Days 12 to 15 Hoi An/Da Nang\n (1.75 days) Days 15 to 17 Hue\n (1.75 days) Days 17 to 19 Phong Nha\n *Wanted to do only 1 day but think if I wanna see the caves will need a whole extra day\n (.75 days) Days 19 to 20 Vinh or Thai Hoa\n *OR I am going to skip and take a bus from Dong Hoi to Ninh Binh saving a day\n (1.75 days) Days 20 to 22 Ninh Binh\n (3.75 days) Days 22 to 26 Hanoi\n (2.75 days) Days 26 to 28 Ha Long Bay *Already booked\n (1 day) Day 28-29 Stay Near Airport in Hanoi and Go Home\n    submitted by    /u/smmossey88  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I want to make a music playlist or compilation for my parents of music they might have listened to in their youth. It's both for them just for fun but also in case one of them develops dementia or Alzheimer's disease. If you didn't know, playing music from someone's formative years can help them have clear and lucid moments if they have a cognitive degenerative disease. \n Does anyone have specific artist suggestions and where to find them? I am in the US so I usually use Youtube or Spotify to search for music and I'm not aware of what services in VN would have music from that era. Anyway, when I have searched on google, I see a lot of articles about early rock and roll in Sai Gon. I don't think my parents would have listened to that or gone to any of those clubs since they are from Central and rarely traveled to Sai Gon. \n I believe it would be very meaningful to my parents so thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/ForwardStudy7812  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or point me to somewhere that describes it in English?\n Specifically, I heard there is a level / lesson 1 that costs ~$1,000 USD / ~24 million VND. I'm wondering how proficient one would be at English at the end of that? Also, I'm wondering how long it takes for someone to get through that course on average?\n Bonus question: how many levels are there in total for learning English? What is taught in those levels and how long does it take an average adult to complete them?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/jooner  \n [link]   [comments]",

He is now fluent in the spoken and written language (although he’s read a bunch of classic literature so some people tell him he speaks like he’s from the 1920s hahaha). He’s traveled in Vietnam for probably 1.5 years total. \n The other night I was showing him this old book I found about social etiquette in the US in the early 1900s. It had very specific things like “how to write a letter of apology” or “how to help someone out of a carriage.“ As we were reading, he said, “I wish I could find a book like this about the nuances of Vietnamese culture!”\n I’ve looked around the internet, but because I cant speak Vietnamese, most of the books I find are travel books for people that don’t know anything about the country. I’d love suggestions about books written in Vietnamese about the “unspoken“ rules and nuances of Vietnamese culture.\n    submitted by    /u/Elephant_Gun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I will be coming to Vietnam at the end of May. I was planning to do an overnight cruise in Ha Long Bay during my trip, however some of the threads have me a bit concerned. \n A lot of posts in different forums have mentioned about the bay being extremely dirty with floating garbage in most places and smelling of diesel everywhere. Since a lot of these posts are from different years I want to know from someone who has been there recently if that is still the case? If so how badly does it affect the experience? I'm mostly interested in the views and maybe kayaking so please tell according to that. I also read some suggesting to opt for day cruise instead but I have my heart set on spending at least one night under the stars with scenic view on the cruise, are my expectations too much?\n Is it worth spending extra for better quality cruises? I don't plan on splurging what the best 5 star cruises cost, so will probably look for a relatively cheap 5 star or a 4 star cruise. Are they considerably better than the budget/3 star cruises or if I'm not going for the top tier it makes no difference?\n Is Lan Ha Bay a better option? As long as the views are good I won't mind a switch. If the views are not that good but the crowd is considerably less then I will even prefer it. I can compromise on activities a bit as well.\n Please let me know your thoughts.\n    submitted by    /u/lelouch_lamperouge__  \n [link]   [comments]",

He lived in a mainly chinese area of saigon and fled the country with his family after the south lost. The article mentions that “most” of the people who left south vietnam in the 70s were of chinese origin as well. This was surprising to me as i always thought it was mainly people of viet descent and maybe only a few chinese (I only know what i was told since im 2nd gen and was born way after my grandparents left). But do you think this was likely true about boat people being mostly chinese?

I’ll be traveling to the office next week - but am concerned about the risks associated with traveling through customs with oxycodone pills… without them I’d be going through intense withdrawals, so I have to either do the trip and bring pills with me, or find an excuse to cancel the trip outright - which would have some pretty damaging outcomes (and could literally reduce my remaining earn-out from the acquisition by millions of dollars usd).\n I’m not looking for comments on getting clean or other judgements at this phase - I have my own plans for how I’m going to achieve that once the financial aspect of the sale and related earn-outs are completed…. But I do want to better understand the risks id be taking if I travel to VN and going through customs with oxy pills.\n Can someone help clarify what the laws are? Especially for USA foreigners traveling for work?\n To be clear - I don’t have a script and when I travel in the USA I just put them in a pill bottle for an old unrelated medication.

Compared to the US were almost 50% of married people will get a divorce. That is about a 10x of the rate in US. Anyone has some light to shed on the reason why this is the case? Comment from article. \n  \nLowest Divorce Rate in the World Vietnam possesses the lowest divorce rate in the world, at 0.2 per 1,000 people. This is an impressive feat for a country with a population of over 97 million, as it indicates that couples in the region are more likely to stay together than those living elsewhere in the world. In addition to this, Vietnam has one of the highest marriage rates overall. The culture puts considerable emphasis on family and loyalty within relationships, which helps explain why divorce rates are so low. Furthermore, marriage is seen as a means of protection from poverty or any other form of financial instability as couples share costs and resources. Finally, societal norms and expectations play a major role; especially amongst older generations who frown upon divorce and may even threaten older married couples with social exclusion if they decide to end their marriages. All these factors combine to result in very low divorce rates in Vietnam compared to other countries around the world.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/kirsion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should this word be considered rude and offensive?\n EDIT: Apologise, the subreddit name is r/trochuyenlinhtinh, instead of r/trotruyenlinhtinh, rookie mistake on my Vietnamese spelling part lol\n    submitted by    /u/Designer_Walrus_4283  \n [link]   [comments]",

More specifically, will the data be in the local language? / Do you need to have proficiency in the local language in order to find a job in the field?\n 2) Is it sensible for a foreigner to search for those types of job or will a local professional always be preferred?\n 3) Briefly, how would you describe your experience in this field here in Vietnam or East Asia as a foreigner? Positives, negatives, up, downs?\n 4) Finally, do you have any tips or recommendations?\n Thought this may be useful for any foreigner wondering about their career in Asia.\n    submitted by    /u/Zech-17  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know reddit is not the best place for to ask for advice on life changing decisions, but I'm struggling to make a decision. I've booked a flight to Vietnam, which is less than 1 month away, but I'm on the verge of canceling the whole thing. \n To give a bit of background, I've lived in the UK for almost half of my life. I left Vietnam during my high school years and have been working/studying here ever since. I have a good job, earning well above average wage and I'm happy with all aspects of my life here. \n I go back to Vietnam once in a while and was surprised by how much things have changed. There definitely are a lot of opportunities there, especially when it comes to having your own start up firm, and potentially earn way more than if I continue as a salary worker in the UK after taking into account of the cost of living. That and the fact that my parents are getting old and I want to spend time with them, made me want to go back. \n However, within the last 2 months, as I've been saying goodbye to everything and everyone I know here, I just feel a sense of sadness that I'm leaving my comfortable life and good career behind for something that might not work out. I feel like I might be making a big mistake. To make it worse, I'm almost certain now that my relationships with my parents are beyond repair, and we won't get along no matter what. \n My flight is just a few weeks away and I feel very much like just not going to the airport, and just telling my boss that I'm not leaving anymore and going back to the way it was before.\n I'm just posting it on here in the slim chance that someone might have been in the same boat and have some advice to offer.\n    submitted by    /u/Own-Status-4060  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Một ngày nóng nực như mọi ngày, cuộc sống vẫn cứ tiếp diễn y hệt vậy. Từ sau lần cuối xảy ra sự kiện đó, chúng ta đã quá quen thuộc với cái nóng và đã dần thích nghi với nó. Đã gần 300 năm kể từ khi những con quái vật từ trong mặt trời xuất hiện. Chúng ta đã chiến đấu và kết quả nhận được là sự diệt vong trên diện rộng do bão mặt trời từ những con quái vật gây ra. Trong một khu bảo an cuối cùng của nhân loại. Cương vội rít nhẹ điếu thuốc lá có thể xem là còn sót lại cuối cùng trên vũ trụ này. Vốn dĩ anh không hề thích thuốc lá, nhưng từ sau khi chứng kiến Dương, người bạn thân giàu sinh ra tử cùng mình lại biến mất một cách bí ẩn thì anh ta cũng đã thay đổi thói quen và tính cách. Ngày hôm nay cũng như mọi ngày Cương vẫn vậy. Tay cầm khẩu súng và leo lên trạm quan sát. Từ góc nhìn này anh có thể nhìn thấy toàn cảnh khu bảo an. Những đứa nhóc chạy chơi xung quanh những bãi cỏ bị cháy và những người lớn đang canh tác trên những cánh đồng khô héo, xa hơn có thể thấy những thành phố mà anh chỉ được nghe kể về thời kỳ mà con người vẫn còn làm chủ hành tinh này từ những người lớn tuổi. Bất giác anh như vô thức lau đi những giọt mồ hôi chen lẫn nước mắt khi nghĩ về nó. Rồi anh lại hướng mắt xa hơn về phía đó. Bất chợt anh thấy từ xa có vẻ có người đang đi về phía trại bảo an. Ngay lập tức anh ra hiệu cảnh báo để toàn trại vào trạng thái chiến đấu. Các hệ thống cảnh báo vang lên gầm rú như tiếng súng nổ. Các ụ súng và hệ thống tên lửa được kích hoạt, các chiến binh đều đã vào hệ thống công sự để phòng thủ. Bất ngờ Cương vội ra hiệu tắt hệ thống cảnh báo và phòng thủ vì hình như anh nhận ra điều gì đó... Hết tập 1... Mình mới tập viết truyện để giải sầu vì cuộc sống thực nó quá tiêu cực với mình. Ae xem nếu không thích thì cmt để mình gỡ nha, cảm ơn các bạn ! Vô Danh !!!\n    submitted by    /u/Individual_Value_667  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Have you guys heard any stories from your parents about period 1975 - 1986 in Vietnam?\n The period of the “Subsidy Economy” (Bao cap) (1975-1986) has been known as a time of hardships, when mechanism for socio-economic management was inappropriate, causing privations in people’s material and spiritual life. Material life was poor due to a sluggish and inefficient production system, but the constraints also applied to people’s creative and spiritual endeavors.\n “Bao cap” was a period during which both the courage and intelligence of millions of people were suppressed and were anxious about liberation. It was a dramatic period, and a profound lesson about the law of social development.\n During this period, food, goods, and services were purchased with coupons or food stamps. Those with a position in government received more coupons and had access to special shops. For those without special status, they could expect to spend almost a day waiting in line to buy rice and other basic commodities. Everything was controlled by the government. Having a bicycle – even one that was ancient and on the verge of breakdown – was considered a luxury. If you were fortunate enough to own one, you'd be on a special list of bicycle owners allowed to buy parts (such as inner tubes, nuts, bolts, etc.).\n My parents met each other in an illiteracy eradication class. They also told me that when they finished secondary, people ran through backgrounds check (which side you supported during the war) and eventually my parents couldn’t go to high school. Can you guys share your family’s stories regarding this period?\n    submitted by    /u/Sophia_Doan  \n [link]   [comments]",

The doctor highly recommended the Japanese encephalitis vaccine but said it's 2 shots at $350 each in the US but it would be much cheaper if I just get it when I arrive. I'm flying into Hanoi first, but can't seem to find any clinics in Hanoi that offer it. It looks like it's pretty easy to get it in Bangkok....but before I switch up my plans and buy a ticket from Hanoi to Bangkok just for a shot, I figured it'd be wise to check on here and see if anyone can recommend a clinic in Hanoi that offers this vaccine.

I understand there’s often no other way to travel in Vietnam but at least like a pod or something for the baby to TRY to escape a crash without death or permanent disfigurement.\n    submitted by    /u/NameShaqsBoatGuy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "From the west we obviously have a reputation for drinking too much hard liquor and far too frequently. \n But I enjoy a beer about as often as Vietnamese do. \n That is, on special occasions or social gatherings. \n My problem is how much beer. I like 1-2 decent quality beers and some good relaxed conversation.\n But I find over here my cup just keeps getting refilled. 4,5,6,7 beers later and the case is empty. It's just too much for my stomach or bladder to handle to be honest. I didn't even drink like that when I was a delinquent teenager. \n People start getting obnoxious and getting me to say rude and inappropriate things in Vietnamese (which I don't speak very well). And they try to make me say it over and over and over again because they're totally wasted. \n I miss that culture of the west where you can take part in the drinking circle and everyone just drinks as much as they feel like. No pressure to gulp down 5L each. \n I honestly like the taste of Tiger. It's a pretty good beer for a mass-produced brew. \n But I've had to completely give up social drinking while I'm here. My body just can't handle that much anymore. I'm only 27 but I take antidepressants. \n I don't like to drink alone and my wife doesn't like beer. \n So that's my story. This Canadian is done drinking beer. I like the taste, hate the drunk. \n Not meant to be derogatory at all. This is just me expressing myself. I understand every culture is different and I've taken part in the drinking circle once with every new group I meet just to build that trust with them. But from then on I just refuse. It never just stops at 1-2 beers. \n Also, ice in warm beer? Cold out of the fridge man. Cold out of the fridge. Completely ruins the taste for me.\n    submitted by    /u/FoxResponsible4790  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I speak English originally but I would like to learn this language and visit Vietnam one day. Duolingo and the books I got are helping me understand grammar and how to read the language bit by bit, but I SUCK at speaking it, and I know I do. And I don't know any native speakers personally anymore to help correct my pronunciation. I think I end up overthinking and trying to implement the tones but in doing this I just mess the whole word up lol.\n I've tried saying phrases and words really slow then gradually increasing speed til at a normal speaking cadence and this helps a bit but I was wondering if there was something more efficient. Also I feel like due to my natural voice being kind of deep/bassy and the sort of hard way I tend to pronounce things the naturally softer or more nuanced sounds are kind of harsher than the audio samples I'm hearing. I'm just really having a hard time with this because my voice is deep and somewhat monotone unless I'm excited about something so it's hard to do the tones and when I do I feel like I'm over emphasizing them.\n It's bad enough I tend to even stutter a bit more than usual in English too but I completely butcher this beautiful language almost every time it comes out of my mouth. And I wanna be able to speak to native speakers but not laughably 💀 I know most people are gracious and kind enough to just appreciate you even took the time but still why do it if not correctly?\n    submitted by    /u/Fuckredditlowkey  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am dealing with some injurys but have had great success with Active Release Technique (or ART). I was wondering if anyone can reccomend a massage type/parlor that does something similar to this. I know that I probably won't be able to find an ART practicioner while in Hanoi so was wondering what the next best thing may be. For context ART basically involves hitting certain pressure points in soft tissue and manipulating the muscles around them through releases (i know just sounds a regular massage but it's been much more effective than say Thai massages I've had in the past). If anyone has any ideas I'd really appreciate it, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Civil_Nefariousness4  \n [link]   [comments]",

I noticed pretty early on when she eats she tends to make quite a bit of noise and chews with her mouth open. This is something that kind of drives me insane but I’ve gotten used to it. When I met her parents I noticed her Dad made some interesting noises as well. I did gently tell her once for her own awareness that many Americans consider these things rude or slightly gross, but mostly because I didn’t want her to feel embarrassed if she didn’t know. With things like noodles or soup I can understand to a degree but sometimes it’s almost distracting. Is this just a cultural difference and do Vietnamese people have no problem with it?\n Edit: thank you to all those who provided their thoughts and aren’t so sensitive they somehow took this personally lmao, I appreciate it!\n    submitted by    /u/kekimus-maximus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've increased my tip, but I wasn't sure if etiquette called for something more.\n    submitted by    /u/hrhsassypants  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not even 7m from him other locals fishing. \n And I just can’t help but wonder, does he not know that pollution kills potential income and food for his neighbors? Is it education that’s needed?\n Or is it something else?\n And I’m not judging here, I’m honestly curious about why littering is so common in some SE Asian countries.

          "description": "Hi, I’m studying in the US and is set to return to Vietnam this June. I wanted to see how dating is like in Vietnam, specifically Hanoi, before officially returning so I got on Bumble and let’s just say I am scarred for life.\n Every guys I have talked to kind of expressed that I was not good-looking to them. I am 5’2 (163 cm), which is said to be average height but most guys told me I would have a difficult time finding a partner in Vietnam bc that’s too tall. One guy said I looked like a random Tiktok man and another said I looked prudish when his goute was “modern women.” I asked what do modern women look like and he said “someone who is stylish and knows how to take care of herself.” He further said since I went to a Western university, I should have adopted their way of dressing up: more revealing clothes and heavy makeup. I told him that here in the US, it is not that common to see students dressing up and have a full-faced makeup every day. Then he kept asking for bikini and croptop pics. Though I don’t wear bikini, I like crop tops so I can send him some, but I declined bc I think it’s rude to ask for these photos because he wants “to have some motivation to tán me”.\n At first, I just want to find someone I can talk to but these interactions really crushed my confidence and made me hyper-aware of my looks. I wouldn’t say I’m ugly and I have never heard that from anyone else. In fact, a lot of people (both Vietnamese and American) called me cute or pretty. My clothes are not out of style at all. I just don’t like too revealing clothes and don’t like wasting time on heavy makeup. I guess the best word you can describe my style is classic Parisian (and occasionally basic hoodies + jeans). I am starting to doubt whether moving back home is a good idea as it feels like I would not fit in at all. \n Maybe, I guess I just forgot how much Vietnamese cared about vanity.\n    submitted by    /u/No_Understanding9095  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am Pranjal(Male from India). I am highly interested in urban history-seeing how urban spaces originate and grow. Hanoi was of particular interest to me as it possibly is the continuously inhabited oldest city in SEA(from time of Dongson Culture- Co Loa). \n I have spent the past month charting out the history in Hanoi from Co Loa, Northern Domination, Thang Long, French Colonization, Socialist era and post Doi Moi era(till around 2018) going into as much detail as possible. I just landed in Hanoi yesterday and plan to be here for a week. As part of my (amateurish) research, wanted a perspective from a Hanoi local as well who has an interest/knowledge regarding Hanoi's history(especially regarding the architectural history). In return for the help, more than happy to share my knowledge regarding history, bear any transportation/food costs, even cook some Indian food for you :) etc \n Also if in case you have reference of some paid historical service/tour group which can give me an holistic overview of Hanoi from Co Loa to present( I couldn't find any), that will be great as well. \n Thanks in advance for the help :) \n The sources that I have used so far-\n 1. Hanoi: Biography of a City - William Stewart Logan\n 2. Vietnamese Architecture - Le Phuoc\n 3. Van Horen, B. (2005). City profile Hanoi. Cities, 22(2), 161–173.\n 4.

I have lived in Sweden since I was a child and sometimes return to Vietnam after getting married. About 2 years ago, also in April, I was stuck in Vietnam due to the outbreak of COVID. I was surprised to see that the media in Vietnam often publishes positive news about the local epidemic situation but spread the opposite news about other countries, especially the West and the US. I remember they said that American people have no food and students have to eat leftovers. When I asked my wife (100% Vietnamese and her family lives there), she said it's normal with TV stations there. Then, when the nightmares of the epidemic passed and we returned to Sweden, we kept receiving calls from her family in Vietnam, asking if we were okay and hungry because television often broadcast news about the bad situation. like Europe is about to enter the stone age —a food crisis, a gas crisis, that sort of thing. And most recently, when we planned to join a tour, which included a visit to the West Coast of the US, there were calls from her family again, like, be careful of the shootings!\n But yesterday, when my wife showed me this statistic, I just... I wondered what was going on. After the wars, why do Vietnamese people have such warm affection for America?\n    submitted by    /u/freewaytogo  \n [link]   [comments]",

That exams today are very important but i blanked the answer papers in history and geography, but i did finish the literature paper. I know i am rlly a bad student, i once didnt have so many friends in primary and middle school, they once isolated me so i used to try to cut off online connection with them to study more concentrate, in grade 8 my schl used to end at 11:45 am and then i just went home nap til 2 pm and then woke up and start to do hws til 5 pm, then just another break and start w hws again at 7pm and stayed up very late until 3 or 4 am. But my marks didnt get better, it was still low like 4 or 5, and then my classmate at middle school started to bully me like “why you so dumb but u still going to school” “why dont you stay home and do an deadend job(minimum wage job) in the future” “you are humiliating ur parents”, even the teachers humiliated me. It didnt change since i moved to highschool, i cannot change but i ask my parents to move to college or just study for some job thats ez but they want me to study uni.

Since getting here, my phone has gone from working essentially the same as back home (The US) to dying more quickly than charging when plugged in (it only actually charges with the phone turned off), and dying very quickly when not off the charger. When put into airplane mode and with no wifi connected it seems to deplete more slowly. \n These are my guesses as to what is going on:\n a) the combination of charger box and charger cord I have are weak, I should try and find a stronger cord\n b) I am using Verizon's international plan and don't have a SIM card yet, so having my cell service and mobile data turned on is killing my phone. \n I will go out and buy a stronger charger today and likely be getting my SIM installed either today or tomorrow. \n Are there any other problems that could be happening based on anyone's experience that I could be missing? It's starting to make things quite challenging so I'd love any ideas as to how to help!\n    submitted by    /u/213114  \n [link]   [comments]",

Probably one of the most foreign subgroup of VN people and if you ever meet one you know we are weird af, hopefully always in a good way tho. People say I dont even look Viet (In Vietnam) , but I know I'm at least 4 Nguyens generations deep and Ive been visiting my great great grandfathers tombs out there in the jungle, so I should qualify!\n But as far as Vietnamese people and culture go we are useless! We understand Vietnamese in a weird way like only spoken Vietnamese and it should be in a specific context like when you are angry af, it's very selective. And it helps if you sound like my parents, if you have different dialect then sorry không hiểu gì hết!\n I have decided to change that and start hiểu that part of me, Ive been visiting Vietnam (mainly HCM), for a few weeks at the time, for a couple of years now. And guess what my language improved a little bit! This last year Ive visited more than 12 weeks, and the idea of relocating doesn't seem too crazy to me anymore, and actually at this stage of my life kinda makes sense, its a great challenge for me personally, and I honestly feel a little bit bored and in some ways limited here in Sweden.\n So whats my problem, just move!? Well If could just move I would but I need to find qualified work first. Im a software engineer working full-stack with a couple of years experience. Im already looking at some standard stuff that might fit me through regular channels e.g. linkedIn, and I will keep looking there. But its a jungle out there, for a guy who doesn't know the job market over there it all could be a hit or miss. \n Hopefully somebody here has been in a similar situation and can share their experience or have any good insights, or even better set me up!

          "description": "We are here travelling for a few weeks and stumbled across an amazing and fascinating scene yesterday, hoping someone can clarify what it was\n We walked around a corner near the lake in Hanoi to see a group of people shouting and frantically unloading these giant fish (I think they were carp) out of the back of a motorbike. There was a lot of flailing arms, flailing fish, commotion etc as they quickly grabbed and tossed all of the fish into the lake. Some of the fish were massive, so slippery that they were dropped onto the floor and ushered into the water by land.\n A security guard then blew his whistle and they all quickly started praying/meditating, before jumping on their bikes and riding away.\n It was pretty fascinating to watch and our best guess was that it's related to a buddhist fish ceremony. \n Are we correct and does it happen a lot at Hoan Kiem lake? Where do they likely get the fish from if so?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/not_that_much_fun  \n [link]   [comments]",

How they met I believe was through an ex of his who was also Vietnamese. My dad went overseas a few times in 2019/2020 to visit her before Covid hit and the obviously couldn’t travel again. Then in late 2022 he moved the woman and her kid here into the family home despite myself and brother having never met them \n I am aware he was sending her money while she was overseas and since they have arrived in Australia money is a big source of argument. I believe he is still sending money to her family and that his wife still has a Vietnamese bank account and has asked for his password to his bank account. She has brought up multiple times to me that she had looked to live elsewhere in Australia or go back to Vietnam once the date is up that they meet their visa requirements \n This all seems very concerning to me but I’m interested to hear from the Vietnamese community if this is normal or if she is just using my dad for a visa and is going to leave?\n *Forgot to add they legally got married in Australia in February 2023. Did the fake wedding in Vietnam in 2022 which was to appease family apparently. My brother and I weren’t invited or asked to attend but then randomly two days before got asked write a speech for this woman we had never never met…\n    submitted by    /u/United_Natural_6689  \n [link]   [comments]",

We did not just straight up calling them French, Canadian or some nationality. We just referred to them as ”Tây” = Westerner; or “Người nước ngoài” = People from outer countries. If you’re back people will say you black. If you’re white people say you’re white. But when your EA or SEA or random Asian they say ‘Chinese’??? \n Asia is so diverse, there are Laos, Mongolia, Malaysia, etc. :) Especially Vietnam has a painful history fighting back from China and suffers from cultures destruction and assimilation by Chinese, the feeling is worse. \n I wish one day everyone can be more acknowledged of racial diversity in Asia and ask them more general question like : “Which part of Asian are you from?

          "description": "Went inside to test ride a small training bike for my 5 year old. Going on the first test ride, I noticed that the tires were nearly flat deflated. Obviously my kid struggled to ride it well.\n On the return around, I asked why is the tire deflated? Can you inflate the tire so we can have a better test?\n Their smart answer was, \"It comes from the factory like that. If you want us to inflate it, you'll have to buy it first.\"\n Completely ridiculous. Mind you we are still evaluating and testing the product, and you want us to make a buying decision while the product is unusable? After that conversation, I noticed the handle bar was completely loose. Figures as much why my son struggle to turn the bike. I put the bike back to find another bike. The 2nd bike I found also had a handle bar that was also completely loose from the front wheel. Someone assembling the product in their department needs to be evaluated.\n Why on earth do you setup a display of bikes that are unprepared for test ride for children? Why is your smart response are that the bikes \"come from the factory like that\" an appropriate answer for deflated tires? And why do you expect people to buy it from you while they can't even get normal working conditions to evaluate the quality of a product?\n I didnt expect this type of low end service behavior from buying at a department store, at a big mall no less.\n    submitted by    /u/vubitcry  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a very long European given and last name and it doesn't fit on the form.\n I always have to shorten it and that causes me a lot of problems at the airport because while passing control they stop me saying the name in the ticket is no the same name shown in the passport, I always waste time explaining to the staff that my name doesn't fit on the form when I buy the ticket through the Web. Many times I have to wait until manager comes and tell me is ok after check my passport and explain again the issue and once I almost miss flight because they made me wait too long.\n I have contacted the company and they do not give me any solution.

For instance, a recent video showing a policeman kicking a teenage boy while holding a gun has sparked a surprisingly positive response from some Vietnamese netizens.\n In the video, the policeman can be seen kicking the teen who is already sitting on the ground with a gun pointed at him. However, instead of outrage, some netizens have applauded the officer's actions, with comments such as \"Very good beating,\" \"Always support the police,\" and \"I fully support the police officers like this.\"\n This kind of reaction might seem shocking to those of us living in the Western world, where instances of police brutality are often met with widespread outrage and condemn…",

However, can you recommend which SIM Card/company is better? (Just want reliable internet/data)\n \nWhere to exchange currency?: While airport is a no go (will exchange just enough for taxi and check in), curious if there're any specific places with great exchange rates? (Eg. SuperRich in Bangkok is known for its highly competitive exchange rate). \n \n Or Is it feasible to withdraw money from the ATM? (Again, eg. in Bangkok, you are charged 220 THB right away for every ATM withdrawal so unless you're withdrawing chunk of cash, its just dropping money on avoidable)\n  \nWorth it to drive moped/bike to get around?

I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I'm strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.\n As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I'm not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.\n Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats?

I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn't hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.\n He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn't) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn't even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.\n POLICE are zero help because I don't remember the drivers cab number.
