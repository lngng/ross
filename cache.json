The part pertaining to the lyrics state that she sings the following:\n \"It’s wonderful to love like this in the spring, when the expanse of fields blooms. The valleys turn green again, the nightingale captivates with the song. Leave me, leave me, I’m in a hurry to go to the market. I won’t hide it, I love you, but it’s a pity I can’t stay... \"\n The caption goes on to say that the song was created it back in 1957, when the performer participated in a tour of Vietnam as part of a delegation of Soviet art masters. It states that she is wearing the national costume donated to her by the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture.\n I am curious if the song is accurate. Is she really singing in Vietnamese?

Something that I would do with friends mainly and also alone. I’m born European and so know the culture and social codes even in underground spaces.\n So now that I’m on my own here in VN for ths first time ever, I found a bunch of parties I would like to attend, at locations for example: The Observatory, Arcan and The Bar Commune Lab.\n Now all my europe friends are like ‘you should NOT go alone,cause its dangerous to do things alone as a cute female in a third world country’ and in the meanwhile all my friends who are from south east asia themselves, that I met in Europe, are excited for me te explore on my own in VN and make new friends by just showing up here.\n So, what do yall think? Can I go around on my own? Ofcourse a lot of basic female going out things apply like, dont accept drinks from strangers and stuff but idk, I dont feel like Vietnam is that unsafe and these spaces seem experienced when it comes to internationality?\n My viet language is super beginner tho..\n    submitted by    /u/steamed-tofu666  \n [link]   [comments]",

Alone in Europe there is so much cultural differences.\n And then there's the comment sections, turning into what feels like an active war.

But he told me that when he was 17 he needed to go to Vietnam for mandatory military service for a year and that he was a Sergeant-Major. Is this even possible because from what I could find you can only start service in Vietnam when you are between 18-25 and I doubt that becoming a Sergeant-Major is easy.

I saw them watch several meaningless and no value contents (in many topics, for example: cancer maker (without any verification), some dudes telling you how to live a life lol) then they share to us with the thought that it’s a reference that we should follow and absorb. It’s hard to say but I feel like the social media is changing the middle-aged people’s mental health. I think because they aren’t growing up with the social media like us (late of Gen Y and on) so they are lacking of “pick and choose tools” when using social media. They are the most vulnerable social media users I think. What u think bout this? Let’s share some thoughts or any practical case?\n    submitted by    /u/Bel-Maniac-0853  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m there for 5 days only to shop, eat and chill. Secondly, My plan is to change 50% of my currency 50% in card.

One of the houses was blasting dance music, we went over and saw the locals are having a birthday.\n For some reason they really, really, really wanted us to join them and we figured why not. So we danced a little and they immediately offered us their booze (don't really know what it was, maybe banana wine?), we drank one glass but they really really wanted us to drink more, at some point we really had to push them off. When we figured we want to leave they grabbed us by the hands (as if to keep on dancing with us) and they where actually holding unreasonable firmly, one might even call it violently. At the end we managed to shake them off and just wave them goodbye.\n It's important to note, the whole settings where very friendly, there where Children, women and elderly in the party, so we don't think those guys had bad intentions and do us harm. We do wonder why they where so keen on having us on their celebration and why the hell where they holding so strongly?\n    submitted by    /u/WranglerTall1006  \n [link]   [comments]",

Probably a 3-4 year old kid standing on the motorcycle with both his parents sitting in front and behind him, and as always, he wasn't wearing a helmet but the parents were.\n The dad driver did a close maneuever to overtake a public bus but probably forgot about the son standing right behind him. Consequently, the kid's head collided with the side mirror of the bus, causing him to lose balance and fall off the bike. But lucky enough, he fell AWAY from the bus or else it would be a much bloodier scene.\n I don't get this, you can afford a bike, you can afford two helmets each for yourself and your wife, you can afford clothes, you can probably afford a smartphone as well, but a child's helmet crosses the line? Here's an unpopular opinion, if you can't financially & mentally afford a child's helmet, then you probably shouldn't have a child. Don't even get me started on letting your child stand on a moving bike.

          "description": "Hi all,\n First of all, my situation:\n I've been living in HCMC for almost 2 years now but I'm thinking of leaving. My reasons are the high rent, the noise and air pollution, and the traffic.\n Rent here is the highest in Vietnam I think, higher than in Ha Noi I've been told.\n About noise, I tried lots of places and honestly outside of \"luxury\" high rise appartments, other places are affected by noise at night or early morning to the point of being unlivable. I got really depressed once because a place a rented had neighbours arguing all day, karaoke and loud drunk talking at night, funerals,... \n About air pollution, it's worse these days, I can see smog most time I look outside from a high enough floor.\n Traffic is also getting worse. I came to HCMC right at the end of COVID quarantine so it was somewhat normal then, then it got gradually worse. \n Now my question: I'm considering moving to another city, probably Da Nang. Is Da Nang really better in terma of rent, noise, air and traffic? I've been there once and think it's better but it was just a short trip so I'm not sure, heard some stories about karaoke in Da Nang so I want to hear more from everyone.\n    submitted by    /u/assmoede98  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just a small bedroom and bathroom, no living room or anything. \n I wanted to check the electric meter outside my room so I turned off electronics and it wasn’t moving. So far so good. \n I don’t use the fridge , so it’s been off the whole month. Most of my electric usage is for my A/C that runs about 12 hours per day. Otherwise the only other electricity I use is for charging my laptop, or my projector if I’m using it (rarely).\n Electric bill comes in at the end of the month a staggering 1 million vnd! I speak to a neighbor from the house next door. He says he’s paying around 400k for the entire house! \n Now I know the price per KW is 3.000 vnđ, but the landlords make a profit by charging 4.000 vnd. So I’m thinking that either my A/C is super congested and using up a ton of electricity or my landlord is somehow screwing me. \n Any thoughts?

Mata (Māori) can mean face, but may sometimes refer to eye, eyebrow, or looking out. The Cham word for face is also mata.\n This - này - ne (Cham) - nei (Māori) (usually used as tēnei, but also by itself, like in ā te pō nei (this night).\n There are quite a few more that I found.\n Because of these similarities, could there be more of a Cham influence on Vietnamese than I thought?

I have no prior exposure of the language or country whatsoever so I really am clueless about Vietnamese culture. However after doing a little research I found out that people are divided on what the standard dialect of Vietnamese is. Google articles say the standard dialect is Northern Vietnamese but will also tell you that you should learn the Southern dialect instead and materials that teach you the Northern dialect I've noticed are kind of frowned upon. I really have no idea what these mean Which sounds stupid I know but that's why I'll take the time to learn. Does it really matter which dialect I will learn between those two? Are the differences between the two dialects really that noticeable to the point of miscommunication? I also noticed that learning Vietnamese is also not as accessible as learning other languages like Chinese or German so if anyone has/know any free resources to learn Vietnamese then I'd appreciate if you'll share it in the comments...

And be in a semi nice/clean hotel. I also intend to hire a Vietnam local to help with navigation, translation, etc. so a few questions. \n How much should I budget for hotel? Any suggestions?\n How much should I budget for shopping?\n How much should I budget for bribes/transportation?\n I plan to travel to a popular city and more “normal” aka less touristy city if you have any suggestions. \n I also plan on paying my guide/new friend around 7 mil vnd each week (plan to stay for 1-3) and I’m not sure if this is sufficient based on the current economy, I would pay for all food, transportation, etc while they are with me. \n Any other travel suggestions as an early 20s female traveling alone in Vietnam is welcome and thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Viva_Pioni  \n [link]   [comments]",

Đáng ra giờ này mình đang năm 2 đại học, tuy nhiên vì 1 số biến cố mà mình vẫn đang ở nhà nuôi mộng đại học. Và quãng thời gian này mình đang cảm thấy rất tuyệt vọng, mình có những kế hoạch, và mình sợ nó sẽ mãi không thành hiện thực. Để tập trung vào chuyện học hành thì mình đã bỏ hoàn toàn fb, zalo và các bạn của mình thì đang học đại học. Vì thế nên mình không còn ai để nói chuyện cả, và việc không giao tiếp với ai ngoài gia đình thực sự làm mình suy sụp. 1 số lúc thôi, nhưng lúc nó xảy ra mình không biết ứng phó thế nào. Rất căng thẳng, mình cảm thấy bản thân vô dụng, là 1 thằng ăn bám. Suy nghĩ của mình rất rối. Mình cần người để nói chuyện, tâm sự. Tuy nhiên mình lại nghĩ rằng làm thế để làm gì? Cũng không đạt tác dụng gì cả. Làm thế chẳng khác nào thừa nhận rằng bản thân yếu đuối, phụ thuộc vào người khác. Nó đến tự nhiên và cũng rời đi rất tự nhiên. Giờ tự nhiên mình thấy bình thường rồi. Chắc chỉ đơn giản viết ra suy nghĩ của bản thân là đỡ. Sao cần phải nhờ người khác khi tự giải quyết được nhỉ. Good luck brothers. \n Tuy nhiên ai có cách hay thì cho vào đây nhé, mình sẽ rất biết ơn. \n    submitted by    /u/Honest-Marketing-301  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd be more afraid of that tbh! \n The reason why I never feel truly alone or lonely is being I'm at a state of being where I feel content in the present moment, I want to soak it all up and enjoy the time I have here, I talk to people if I want to connect but I also have this freedom to also experience my inner world with the world outside of me and for the time I have here I want to be able to experience that.\n So for another question, what do the introverts or freespirits do here as well in Vietnam?\n    submitted by    /u/deeragunz_11  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, just came back from a 2 week trip in VN and it was amazing. I had a few questions lingering from the trip on my mind, which I wanted to just hear discussion on.\n 1) As title states, why is PQ so empty? It reminds me of a nicer Cancun/Cabo and the people are amazing. For some reason there was ZERO people at Grand World when we visited during the day and then it wasn't even that busy at night either. The shops seemed fake but they actually had workers when we went in so I'm still confused.\n 2) Is tourism down in VN in general this year? Why is that? A lot of the Grab drivers were letting us hire them for the full day and we would just have to pay the Grab rates(or less) and they didn't charge at all for waiting time... (for example if we went to Grand World for 5-6 hours, he would just charge us for the ride there and back)\n    submitted by    /u/jackjohnsonbush  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I've gathered, grab/other taxi services aren't that common around the island, and renting a car is impossible. But we'd still like to explore and move around and I'm getting a bit discouraged by the research I've done so far.\n Is there an option I haven't considered yet? Or, maybe my research is wrong?

          "description": "Hi all,\n Recently left Vietnam after back packing through it for 90 days; missing it already. In my last few days in Hanoi before flying out I redownloaded Pokemon Go just to see what's up, and on my last day there I caught a Beldum with perfect IVs.\n Now, I learned a little Vietnamese (mostly so I could order food in a restaurant from a Vietnamese menu) but I don't exactly have a wide vocabulary. I wanted to nickname that Beldum something Vietnamese and was wondering, for any pokemon fans here, if you have any good ideas for what you might nickname a Metagross.\n Otherwise I'm gonna be stuck calling the thing \"Bánh mì\", and it deserves better.\n    submitted by    /u/cool-but-not-really  \n [link]   [comments]",

Of course we would be very tactful if we could, just explaining that it is not the norm in this culture to give such an exorbitant gift.

I usually don't eat soups because I find them boring, like the classic veggie or chicken soup that almost everyone makes, or tomato soup, potato soup and so on. They're ok, kinda bland sometimes, but nothing special to me. \n But the first time I tried Pho Bo, it just blew me away, the combination of flavors is just spectacular. Now whenever I go to this restaurant, I always start with a Pho Bo. Then I continue with other stuff like Bahn Mi, Bún chả and others that I forgot their name and struggle to pronounce them, but I'm trying to learn. I think it's good to learn their real names, it's a sign of respect and appreciation. \n I also like that they're playing traditional Vietnamese music on speakers, I find it very relaxing.

          "description": "I think some of this explains a lot of the recent posts….\n Not that it matters so much, but I’ve lived in Vietnam the past 20 years, can speak the language, etc. I’m not asking for an appeal to authority, but I have, in my view, earned the right to judge. \n In terms of the most important parts of culture, Vietnam is a toxic mess that needs to grow up and figure itself out. Now let me qualify that. \n When you get to know Vietnamese people, they are great. Some of my best friends are Vietnamese. People I would trust with my kids. They’re kind, gentle, caring, and generous. But this is a one-on-one thing. \n Then there’s the public culture. When the cloak of anonymity drops and no one knows you, people are often vile and selfish. The noise, the littering, the way people drive, elevators, queui…",

          "description": "I’ve read a couple of posts/ comments on this sub about experiences of black people in Vietnam. One said that in Vietnam black people are thought to be, aggressive or dirty or unlucky and should expect racism, and not be treated like other tourists, i.e. in a welcoming way. I realise no country is free of racism (some are worse than others) but is it likely to be so apparent that it negatively impacts my experience of Vietnam? If so I would like some insight so I know what to expect.\n I’ve travelled to a handful countries in SE Asia most have friendly locals and I didn’t feel any different to any other travellers. Except in two-ish cases. One country was memorable for people handing me babies to take photos and basically being in a zoo like situation and in another I experienced constant racism, being called a ghost people whispering behind your back, not being served like other people in restaurants etc. The only place I was treated well in that country, was the hotel I stayed at. I plan on going back to the first country because as tiring as that became, after the novelty of being an instant celebrity wore off, the people were not inherently racist just not exposed and they were actually lovely people. The second I will avoid for as long as I can.\n I plan on making the most of this trip either way because I like to experience new places but some insight would be helpful so I can be mentally prepared. It’s a short trip so I’ll only be going to HCMC and Nha Trang. Apart from a few trips to areas near these places, I won’t be venturing anywhere else.\n    submitted by    /u/Icy-Tea2090  \n [link]   [comments]",

Một số ý tưởng hoặc công thức nấu ăn nào chúng tôi có thể đưa ra sẽ bán chạy và được ưa chuộng? Chúng tôi có không gian bếp nhỏ nên khó có thể đưa ra nhiều lựa chọn khác nhau cùng lúc.\n    submitted by    /u/WolverineUpset3640  \n [link]   [comments]",

We went to the official Viettel store in Hoi An, and she looked up the sim cards. She said that they were very old and that they were not registered on their network anymore. She also told us to only buy from an official Viettel store, and said that there are no official Viettel stores at Da Nang airport. We had to buy new sim cards (we paid 170k for 2 gigs a day for a month - less than the 240k we paid at the airport). Thankfully we paid with a credit card so we can dispute the charge.\n    submitted by    /u/Logical_Deviation  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are just blown away by this beautiful country and it’s people.\n There’s just so much to see and do in this beautiful country. Only being here for a few days we were so sad to leave but have so much appreciation for the hustle and bustle life of busy cities like Hanoi, as well as the calm and quiet lifestyle of those in Cat Ba.\n The variety of food options available here makes me so embarrassed as a westerner who had only heard about Pho. My favourite meal was when I had a local home cooked meal prepared by the wife of the caption who was taking us on a tour on Ha long bay. \n Lastly, the people. I have never met such wonderful, accommodating and most admirably hard working individuals in any other place in the world. Some people on this sub say that people nag tourists to buy stuff, but I see that as them working hard to earn their keep. I just feel so much respect and admiration and ashamed at the times I have felt lazy to do my privileged job. \n So grateful to have had this travelling experience in this beautiful country and can’t wait to be back.\n    submitted by    /u/Yosoytired  \n [link]   [comments]",

How much should women often “challenge” their Vietnamese partners for wedding?\n Introduction of myself: I am Chinese girl living in Hanoi. My sister and brother-in-law moved their factory here in 2018. I saw them having a good life here . They can afford having kids which is nightmare in China nowadays. So I decided to move and work here. I’m 24 years old, and it’s time to think about serious traditional relationship. My brother in law introduced me his Vietnamese customer. He’s a great and humorous guy. He’s running 3 clothes stores and online shops. We’re having good relationship and I think about marriage. In China, women’s families often expect wedding presents as cash from men. In my home province in China, it’s often 100000 cny (340 million vnd). I don’t expect the same amount in Vietnam. May be our tradition can be different. I’m curious how much I should expect from my future Vietnamese husband.\n I’m ready for marriage life here. My personal finance is good. And I improved my Vietnamese a lot. I can sing See Tinh well 😁. It’s very easy for Chinese to pronounce Vietnamese words.\n    submitted by    /u/Express-Sleep-7219  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to look for new work because she 'fired' me like a month ago?? But I've still been working for her??\n Basically, she told me at first that the company can't keep me because they can't afford teachers and I'm not good enough. But then she said I could stay at the accommodation while I find new work.\n Then when a new company showed interest, she told me I can't change over because I'll get the company in trouble? She explained that she has to cancel my visa first. The agent says I need a letter from my bo…",

Then later on the beach, all calm, and along come a huge flock of about 40 of them, walking literally right next to me even though there's so much space, yelling at each other. Wtf is going on?! Lol. Can Chinese people travel alone or in couples or is it a government rule by the ccp that they must travel in large flocks of minimum 50 and cause maximum impact wherever they go... Just curious....

People bonding over music and enjoy life in karaoke bars/rooms in noisy areas like Kabukicho, far from residental areas.\n Just came back to Vietnam, a country that is the complete opposite of Japan in every way imaginable and I swear it sounds like someone is running a duck over with a lawnmower every time they pick up a microphone. I'm no Freddie Mercury by any means, but it has to be something in the water here making people tone-deaf.\n I just got to my girlfriend's house, she has been really sick for a week, and despite knowing that the neighbors have been playing karaoke nonstop. Extremely selfish? Yes. But, I'm currently listening to what sounds like a roadkill dying and I want to stab my eardrums out with chopsticks.\n How is this legal? In every other place I've ever lived, the police would shut this tragedy of a performance down asap. Is it the way the language sounds or are people supposed to sound like they're drowning when they sing? Can we get a petition going to forever ban karaoke machines within a 4km radius of any city? \n    submitted by    /u/MarkyTeriyakiYouTube  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I expected people to do research to know what to expect and today alone theres 2 posts about scam taxis in TSN. I get it, its a mess of an airport. Sometimes its a maze just to navigate so ill try to make it easier. I assume u have downloaded grab before the trip to SEA, and u can pay in cash.\n If u dont have any data, it is possible to ask your hotel to arrange transportation. Usually higher end places can do this. Somebody will hold a sign with your name at the arrival gate. Airport wifi kinda wacky sometimes\n If u arrive from international airport, once ur out of the airport, go across the street to the parking lot. There are prearranged Grab vehicles spots where they can pick u up. Book them and head there asap\n If u arrive from domestic, its a lil annoying but doable. Leave the domestic terminal and head to the building across, this is the parking building.\n parking building\n Head straight pass all the shophouses and little kiosks to the parking lot looking area\n ​\n Grab pick up area\n Grab's designated pickup area is on lane D1, from pillar a5 to l5. Book em and wait for em here.\n Do:\n - Turn on location on grab so the grab driver know where u are\n - Ignore all the trip or taxi sellers on the way\n - Keep an eye on exact pickup location. Grab gives u a range of pillar (ie d5 to j5). Stay at the right place so the driver can pick u up on time. They only have about 3 minutes\n - Check if its the right plate number, cant even tell u how many people forgot bout this\n DONT:\n - Take any taxis other than Vinasun or Mai Linh. Even for these 2 brands they tend to send \"VIP\" taxis that charge u at higher rate\n - Spend time listen to anyone dissuate u from taking ur booked ride for \"cheaper\". Tell em u had a ride and move pass em\n - Let ANYONE even touch ur wallet. Like tf??\n Airports are hotspots for scams, its like this for any country. Its the same shit outside of Charles de Gaulle or Beijing. Stay vigilant and enjoy ur trip\n    submitted by    /u/IDontKnowVietnam  \n [link]   [comments]",

How quickly can banks usually get out a new card? I used my card on Grab to order a few meals and some water. I have 20,000 in dong.\n A total headache, my god. 😆 Any informed advice would be most appreciated!\n Edit: From the USA\n Whoever downvoted this is a sociopath 😆\n    submitted by    /u/Existforlove  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "been in hanoi 7 days now, super surprised about how eager everyone seems to be to put tourists on motorbikes. feels like there’s a conspiracy to keep the hanoibus lines secret. they’re cheap and about as reliable as your average US urban bus. why aren’t they more often suggested? is it because Vietnamese people don’t want to share their public transport with tourists/foreigners? yes they’re slow, yes you detour, maybe these are good things that some tourists might actually want?\n anyway. after some stumbling about i finally figured out that if you put “xe <province name>” into google it’s pretty easy to find the regional bus routes, too, which i assume (perhaps foolishly?) won’t be much worse. \n but here’s the thing. i sorta want to relive some version of my experience from 20 years ago on Java riding the indonesian version of “Xe khách dù” using only speaking knowledge of numbers, and before google. the only guide i found suggested they’d be impossible for foreigners to navigate, which seems ??? . uncomfortable, sure. absolutely no equivalent to anything “back home” in europe - 100%, correct. but “impossible?” really?\n we’re trying a regional bus tomorrow to one of the “craft villages” that all the guides say you should hire a taxi to get to (??). if that works then i think i would like to give a “Xe khách dù” a shot. \n is this a terrible idea? will my presence on one will cause more upset or offence than curiosity or humour (including humour at my expense, “look at the stupid foreigner” kinda thing)?\n    submitted by    /u/whatisthedifferend  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can anyone suggest the best spots for paragliding that won't break the bank? The prices I've seen online are crazy – nearly $100 for one person! I'm sure the locals might have some better insights. It's more expensive than the 5-star hotel I'm staying at, which is pretty amusing! 😄\n Also, besides paragliding, I'd love recommendations for other fun activities in the area. Any local favorites or must-do experiences? Thanks a bunch!\n Edited: Moreover, Is this national park worth going with a tour guide or DIY should be fine? https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/11139-trekking-bach-ma-national-park-day-tour-hue/\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Pomegranate_4611  \n [link]   [comments]",

And then ultimately crushed in 1978 when the battle-hardened Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia. \n It got me thinking about what would have happened if he had invaded the much weaker South Vietnam, assuming it hadn't collapsed so quickly. Could he have pushed through to Saigon? Would China, who preferred to have Vietnam divided, have provided more support? Any good sources or alternate history places to read more?\n    submitted by    /u/DiscussT  \n [link]   [comments]",

One thing I noticed, particularly in shops, cafes and restaurants is that while in the other countries (even hyper expensive Singapore), buildings were usually an arctic blast the moment you walk in, a lot of places in Vietnam often only have 1 AC unit running, AC set to a high temperature or areas of the premises partitioned off for \"cleaning\".\n I also noticed they usually just open the windows in the morning in spite of the noise, heat and pollution, waiting till the heat was unbearable before finally shutting the windows and turning the AC on and would sometimes turn off the AC 30 minutes or more before closing time. Is it really that expensive to run AC in Vietnam? . .

          "description": "​\n ![img](i6pmivydq31c1 \" \")\n Mới vụ gần đây có một tiktoker bị bóc phốt vì nói lớ tiếng việt. Căn bản là bạn này sinh ra ở Việt Nam nhưng sống ở Mỹ cũng được nhiều năm. Mới gần đây, bạn ấy có đăng một vài video trong đó bạn nói tiếng Việt có bị chậm. Không biết là ai ném đá trước nhưng sau một thời gian thì có nhiều Tiktoker khác bu vào chửi bới và khinh bỉ rằng OOP giả bộ không biết Tiếng Việt để tỏ vẻ Mỹ Trắng.\n Lúc đầu thì mình cũng ngỡ ngàng tại vì mình sống nước ngoài cũng khá lâu. Mình chưa bao giờ tiếp xúc với người Việt gốc nào giả bộ nói lớ tiếng Việt để “làm màu”. Những comments mình đọc được thì cũng nhiều thành phần nói thẳng ra là vô cùng vô văn hoá và thiếu suy nghĩ. Bao nhiêu người, già hay trẻ, xô vào để cấu xé cô gái có 22-24 tuổi làm vài video giải trí trên mạng. Rồi nhiều Tiktoker còn tự chế thông tin kêu là bạn này mới qua được một năm, bạn này bắt chước hoa hậu nào đó cũng bị lớ giọng sau khi học nhiều thứ tiếng. Thật sự là mình hơi ngạc nhiên khi thấy tình trạng bóc phốt bây giờ nhỏ nhặt đến mức chỉ nói lớ tiếng Việt là ăn chửi. Liệu Tiktok VN bây giờ có thô thiển quá mà chỉ toàn “The Drama”, kiếm nạn nhân để mà chửi câu view hay không? \n    submitted by    /u/poorboy2022  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a white guy travelling slowly by train and stopped in a small station called Bong Son 80km north of Quy Nhon then went 15km north with a taxi. There's obviously very little tourism there especially westerners so at least 1/3 of people say hello or ask questions, kids come running to me etc but mostly positive encounters.\n Of course some laugh at me because I'm a 185cm dude on some tiny multicolor bicycle I got from my hotel roaming the dirt roads but I don't mind.\n But today I was cycling at this spot https://maps.app.goo.gl/WJqaow9SXyUgEGic9 and a young guy around 16yo on a scooter stopped me in the middle of the road and was quite angry for some reason. Couldn't speak a word of english and I can't speak vietnamese. He left after maybe 2 minutes so I kept going the same way (down south to get to a creek) and he turned back, turned again and was behind me and gave me a kick with his foot in the back of my bicycle.\n I realised he certainly didn't want me to go that way for some reason so I turned back and I didn't see him again.\n Any idea what happened there ? It's not like there were house nearby or I was in a private property.\n    submitted by    /u/kaiben_  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far here's my experience, the ho Chi Minh song from vietjetair is stuck in my head, I feel a deep sense of pride for him even though I wasn't born here,I oddly comfortable here, I ate Banh mi Huynh hoa, I spoke to the locals, I got scammed but hey it's all experienced so I'm not mad, just a little disappointed but hey it's life.

          "description": "Hi, we are two canadians traveling for three months in Vietnam and we will like suggestions for a place to stay (city/village) for a couple weeks. We enjoy nature and calm but also maybe a place with a couple bars where we can meet people and also some nice cultural events. We were thinking somewhere north and we are not sure if we are going to stay very long in the south because of the hot weather. ( We like the cold!) Eventhough our flight back home will be leaving from Ho Chi Minh City. We are in Hanoï right now and we are craving for a place much less busy and quieter (we have been in cities for the past 3 weeks). It can also be in center Vietnam, we were thinking of being there at the end of December / beginning of January. Thank you for you advice!\n    submitted by    /u/La_Bernache  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just found the 30M information on the recruiter's profile.\n Thanks to you, from my understanding it may be great for a local but not for an expat. Let's hope their package is evolving if they want to hire an expat, or let's pray that they forgot a number !\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/ondolondoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ran across the work of Mark Alves, a linguist who basically reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of Vietic language. And I started to realise how Vietnamese really kinda stands on its own as being a SouthEastern and East Asian language. I don’t why but this was my shower thought about why there is so much Chinese built within Vietnamese language.\n I noticed in his work there was a lot of old Chinese (and of course other dialects and Chinese words over history) still used in Vietnamese. I had a weird shower thought that Vietnamese language seems like a sponge for Chinese language, if they didn’t have an existing word for it they just take it from their big neighbours. And I think hearing from my family about colonialism isn’t the whole story why there’s so many words adopted. I’m curious about if anyone knows if there are studies on this.\n    submitted by    /u/KeiHaruki  \n [link]   [comments]",

We can’t get off the train, and we’re not being given any information by the staff, or the tourism company the train service is with. There’s not much food or water, and the staff are hiding from us. \n I’m starting to get quite worried and stressed. Does anyone know when the floods will recede? Or could we be stuck here on the train until the weekend or longer? We’re scared we will run out of food and water and power soon. We definitely won’t move until morning now. \n We would get off and try to find a car to take us back north, but it’s dark and too risky, we don’t know the situation out there. \n Please stay safe everyone in the region!\n Edit: woke up. We’ve still not moved. We’ve been on the train for 36 hours+ now. It’s still raining heavily. My boyfriend is starting to get sick and is coughing with no water. We’re starting to get very sad and scared. We haven’t seen any staff members for 10+ hours. We’re not at a station so can’t get off. We’re on a ‘tourist carriage’ so no Vietnamese to ask for help. We’re ‘safe’ physically from the rain, and I’m grateful for that, but I’m so fed up of not knowing. At this point, we just want to fly back home from what was meant to be our dream trip. I feel so, so guilty for suggesting we take the train 😭 \n Edit 2: staff has abandoned us. We cannot find them. We have had news and no supplies for 12+ hours.

          "description": "I am still disturbed by what I saw yesterday.\n On the shoulder of a road, there was a truck. On the loading area, numerous crates were filled with dogs. In each crate, there were so many dogs that they were stacked on top of each other. Some of the dogs were trembling, utterly frightened, or not moving at all. I suspect some of them were already dead.\n I presume these are stray dogs that have been captured. But what is done with them? Are they taken somewhere and killed? Is that even legal? If they are killed, why are they subjected to such cruelty first? Not to mention, I don't find killing them acceptable.\n    submitted by    /u/Panoramajaeger  \n [link]   [comments]",

Their main speciality was a huge banh mi with beef short rib as the meat, they put it on the roll with the bone still in and then pull the bone out.\n I'm flying into Vietnam for the 7th time later this week and was hoping to try this place but have lost any record of it and can't find it anywhere. Hoping someone here may be familiar with it and can help.\n If it helps, they also offered a few more different/fancy banh mis including a seafood one with caviar. It wasn't one of the $100 banh mis or anything, was about 3-400K or so and big enough to feed 2 people.\n    submitted by    /u/Locoj  \n [link]   [comments]",

Any carry-on under 7kg would be mostly empty. \n I don’t care if an airline wants to make more money and charge more. They can certainly do so, but they should have reasonable rules and clear prices.\n I just had a bad experience checking in to a VietJet flight where the employe made me empty my carry-on and put half of the things in my big bag and half in my backpack. They checked in my big bag which was now slightly over the 20kg limit and my almost empty carry-on. They kept telling me to make my backpack lighter, but it was that heavy because of my laptop, iPad and battery pack which can’t be checked in because they contain lithium batteries.

Specifically, many Vietnamese restaurants use egg-based (yellow) roll wrap paper and not the clear, white rice paper. I was always told that the yellow one was the Chinese way of making them, and that proper cha gio were made with the clear ones. (Is this true?) Personally, I prefer the clear white wraps 100% of the time. I’m disappointed when I order cha gio in a restaurant and I get the yellow kind. Does anyone know how I can ask what kind of paper they use and what answer reflects my preferences? Will a Vietnamese restaurant look at me sideways for even asking?\n Thanks!\n Background: American, but my (White) grandmother was born and raised in Vietnam. Our family has since adopted some Vietnamese dishes as part of our family culinary traditions, including thit koh, bun thit, and cha gio.

I was minding my own business and having fun with three other Viet women. They were like 45 kilograms of chicken these women. The women were enjoying themselves with the drinks I was buying. I was balling out with these 45 kilogram chicken and they were loving it. Then all the sudden this crazy tourist comes over trying to be a hero and tell me to take my hands off the product. I ignored him as I paid for these women, so I kissed them. He said something again about me touching the woman. So I grabbed the women again to piss him off and kissed them as well. The guy looked miserable. Like he had come to vacation with his wife and mother in law. He was jealous as I left my wife and mother in law at home. Why would you bring that kind of sand to the beach? There is plenty of sand here to play with. Any how, the women were having fun and enjoying my company. These tourist should mind their business just like I was. We are some hard working men from Malaysia here for some R&R. These type of tourist confuse me. Are they here to vacation and have fun or play some fantasy superhero? If the women were in trouble they could scream or call the police. There was plenty of people around and we were all having fun. 🤩 Enjoy life my people.\n    submitted by    /u/chubrock420  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just a fun story I wanted to share, no offense to anyone who digs the style I‘m going to talk about.\n My dad migrated from Vietnam 30 years ago and what striked me almost my whole adolescent life was his particular style of clothing. Like everything has a luxury brand name on it. All in all it it’s this kind of „young money“ street style from 2010. Sunglasses, caps, LV satchel, expensive watch, you name it, paired with buddhist accessories. From a fashion standpoint it’s completely randomly combined. This stands out even more since no other 60 year old man dresses this way in the country I grew up in. Though I’d say especially migrant groups tend to do that as well as a status symbol though there‘s something, besides the jade bracelets and stuff, that makes it so different and I really can‘t say what.\n And then, in 2019, I visited Vietnam for my first time. And when I walked around Bui Vien street or took the local busses, I’ve seen other middle aged men that radiated some thuggish ominous vibe like bouncers and I realized They wear the same outfits!! I don‘t know what exactly made it so similar but the composition of their outfits reminded me immediately of my dad. I had the feeling they wore even more accessories like a watch but also a jade bracelet and a wooden pearl bracelet on the same arm. It‘s so weird hahaha but now I know, where he got that inspiration from\n    submitted by    /u/eggisch  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I vacated the place, he visited the place and confirmed that he will return the deposit. He carried on my duty to pay the bills and lèa the house. Later on, he also replied a message to return the money on Oct 12. However, it has been a month since, and he has not returned the deposit. He refused my phone calls and never reply his reason not to return the money. Since sueing or asking for money is potentially problematic, I want to ask. 1. is it ok to ask his friends/wife/people at his place for his whereabouts? 2. how to sue now that I left Hà Nội and can't return. Would the government office, whatever that handles the case request me to be in Hanoi to carry on with the case? I also have heard that his wife works in the court and this will most likely thrown out. So how to make sure that the case will go. 3) there are many laws, on of which is the notorious 331 that puts people in prison for supposedly defamation of character.

She really liked this hotel but something feels off. Some comments on booking are a bit weird and I can't find much on google, but it's on booking so... Anyone knows anything about it? \n Otherwise, any recommendations for a good resort/hotel in Nha Trang, Tuy Hoa or around that area? Nha Trang is where I'm ok spending money on accomodation since it's the only place where we'll actually spend time at the hotel/resort, so I'm looking for one of those 5 stars with amazing buffets, pools and all that. \n Any other recomendations regarding Nha Trang and its surroundings are welcome :)\n    submitted by    /u/SalmorejoFresquito  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Around 9:30 PM tonight, November 11, 2023, I was passing through the Kim Liên tunnel, Hanoi, Vietnam. I was on the back of a fast-moving motorbike when I randomly looked up at the sky and saw many flashing, color-changing circles like these. These are original videos and ones that have been made to slow motion so you can see everything in different speed. At first, I thought they were lights from a crane on a high-rise building, so I looked away. But a few seconds later, I looked up again and wondered “what? hold on…” how there could be such a high building in the sky! I tried to take a photo but couldn't because the bike was moving too fast, so I recorded videos instead. It looked very surreal and strange in person. I've never seen anything like this before. Did anyone else passing by that area tonight look up and see the same thing? Could these be drones? Can anyone explain what this might be? \n diabayvietnam #diabayhanoi\n    submitted by    /u/Alarmed-Feeling-754  \n [link]   [comments]",

Especially in major cities like Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, the streets of Vietnam are a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds, where thousands of vehicles move incessantly. Foreigners may be surprised to witness the sight of motorcycles – the dominant mode of transportation in Vietnam – gliding smoothly through narrow streets, sometimes carrying an entire family or towering loads of goods. Alongside these, leisurely bicycles, creatively crafted homemade vehicles, traditional ‘Xích lô’, and even large trucks jostle together, creating a multi-hued tapestry of urban life.\n Read more: Unique Vietnam travel - Vietnam Traffic Challenge - VN Charm Travel \n Vietnam traffic at night\n    submitted by    /u/VNCharmTravel  \n [link]   [comments]",

From the street sellers who give me less change money than I'm supposed to get, the \"take a photo with my fruit basket on a stick\" and then heckling you to give photo money or buy something, \"take a free donut\", etc. It's wearing me down as I'm a very honest person and have tried my entire adult life to support little mom and pop shops with their businesses. We just spent 2 months in korea and a week in Japan and those locals were very honest, did not heckle, and if they offered a free sample, it was really free. Plus the lack of consideration. Last night at 1:30am, there is construction still going on like a circular saw and banging metal. I wake up to it, and have to sleep with it. Does the police or other locals not care about quiet sleeping time? We have never encountered something like this on a constant basis in any other country we've traveled to.\n We are scheduled to leave here next week, then off to Ho Chi Mihn for a week, and then after that we had scheduled Da Nang for a whole month but now considering canceling Da Nang if it's going to be more of the same. So for people who have traveled to Da Nang, can you tell me if we will be facing the same situation as here in Old Quarter Hanoi?\n ​\n We have met some really nice people in nice shops who offer us good service and the right change so we have been returning to those spots to eat. There's a coconut/smoothie spot we enjoy so everyday we buy 5 drinks.\n    submitted by    /u/EndTheFedBanksters  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi I just wanted to give an update on this poll I did a while back: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/16jlwu5/market_research_for_handbagtote_bag_fashion_start/\n ​\n I'm slowly launching the tote bags that I described in the original post. I feel a little bit embarrassed to try to push this new project out there but what do I have to lose then to share my experience right?\n I am so thankful for the people who voted in the poll and gave their opinions. It really helped me narrow down my focus. This is a passion project that stemmed from a long overdue trip to Vietnam.\n I was born in a refugee camp in Malaysia and moved to Canada when I was 4. I only been to Vietnam once when I was 14 on a family trip. Then this year back in April I decided to go back to Vietnam on my own at the age of 30. It was an incredible experience reconnecting with family and making new friends as a solo traveler who can barely speak Vietnamese. I have to say that Vietnamese locals are so open and love to connect with foreigners - I think that's what makes the country so great!\n Anyways, I got a felt tote bag from a popular Men's wear brand there and walked around with it in Canada, constantly getting compliments on the bag. I decided to start my own brand selling these felt tote bags with my own designs. Right now the designs and branding is focused on the soft \"Asian\" girl aesthetic but I hope to venture beyond these tote bags to explore different aspects of being Vietnamese living outside of Vietnam. I feel that we are constantly trying to connect to heritage while building a unique Western-Vietnamese experience navigating two cultures.\n I hope you guys follow The New Win on social media and check out the website: bythenewwin.com.\n As you can see the poll winner \"Saigon District 1\" inspired the first design. I'm gearing up for the first Drop soon and I hope you check back for more Drops in the future.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/wowelephants  \n [link]   [comments]",

But on Sunday pictures were published in state media of an enormous construction site running through the waters – and next to the spectacular karsts – of Bai Tu Long Bay, which borders Ha Long.\n https://preview.redd.it/qx30sp82w8zb1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a5fb02c727f2e9c8d1592c76ff464a22ce0b3c\n https://preview.redd.it/ybid9i17w8zb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb5e2dc9c1995a35b2e91560842536e4fccde809\n  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In 1123–1150, Vietnam managed to repel a combined Khmer and Cham invasion. The Khmer Empire was at its peak of power at that point but it lost to Vietnam.\n In 1075-1077, the Vietnamese Ly Dynasty launched an invasion deep into Song China's territory. They were still a small kingdom that only gained independence 100 years ago and were attacking the strongest empire on earth at the time. The Song responded by invading Vietnam but they were defeated.\n The Mongols also invaded Vietnam and were defeated in all 3 times.\n While the Ming Dynasty conquered Vietnam in 1407, they were only able to hold Vietnam for 20 years.\n In 1471, Vietnam managed to wipe out Champa, which was an enemy for over 500 years out of existence. This is akin to France wiping Spain or Germany out of existence.\n In 1785, th…",
