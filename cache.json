This weekend I was at a temple and as we were leaving I went to grab my shoes from the shelf but an older lady was in front so I said “xin lỗi bà...” She turned around and said some things I did not understand, but from her tone I’m pretty sure they weren’t very happy. \n Did I insult her?? Is there something different I should have said??

I have my European motorcycle license, so I'm fairly confident on the bike.\n I've always wanted to do a tour between Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, mainly riding through the mainland. However, after doing some research I get a lot of sources saying the north of Hanoi is the place to be.\n On one hand I'd love to get as much a vibe of Vietnam as possible, which seems the Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi would provide best. On the other hands, if the best sites are in the north, then I can totally be convinced to go there.\n Is there anyone who could give me some advice on this?\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/a_guy_named_rick  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, apologies for using English and the google translation below. \n ​\n I LOVE FOOD!!! One of the most exciting parts of coming to Vietnam for me is learning about the culture and food that Vietnamese people are so beautifully famous for. \n ​\n My problem(?) is that I have had gastric sleeve surgery so I can't eat much. Generally in Australia, my husband and I order one meal to share, but if I want something he can't eat or doesn't like, I will order my own meal and take the leftovers home to reheat later. That's going to be a little hard when I'm trying to eat as many different type of Vietnamese food as possible.\n ​\n Would it be offensive or \"bad\" for me to order a whole meal for myself and leave a lot of leftovers? I'd love for us to order 2 different Pho's and get to experience both but would it be a bad thing if we didn't eat it all? \n Any tips on how to explain/apologise for my limited eating capacity will be well received!!!! PLEASE! \n Google translate below:\n Xin chào tất cả, xin lỗi vì sử dụng tiếng Anh và bản dịch google bên dưới.\n ​\n TÔI YÊU THỰC PHẨM!!! Một trong những phần thú vị nhất khi đến Việt Nam đối với tôi là tìm hiểu về văn hóa và ẩm thực mà người Việt Nam vốn nổi tiếng xinh đẹp.\n ​\n Vấn đề của tôi (?) là tôi đã phẫu thuật dạ dày nên tôi không thể ăn nhiều. Thông thường ở Úc, vợ chồng tôi gọi một suất ăn để chia nhau, nhưng nếu tôi muốn món gì mà anh ấy không ăn được hoặc không thích, tôi sẽ gọi suất ăn của mình và mang phần thừa về nhà hâm nóng lại sau. Điều đó sẽ hơi khó khăn khi tôi cố gắng ăn càng nhiều loại thức ăn Việt Nam càng tốt.\n ​\n Gọi nguyên một suất ăn cho mình mà để lại nhiều thức ăn thừa thì có phản cảm hay “xấu” không? Tôi rất muốn chúng ta gọi 2 phở khác nhau và được trải nghiệm cả hai nhưng không ăn hết có phải là một điều tồi tệ không?\n Mọi lời khuyên về cách giải thích/xin lỗi về khả năng ăn uống hạn chế của tôi sẽ được đón nhận!!!!

I thought he was the official taxi rank guide, but looking back obviously he was a partner / part of this particular taxi company.\n Taxi driver was chatty and had fairly good English, asking us about our home country.\n First issue was the exit toll - didn't realise there was one - he said we had to pay it, pointing to a sign on his sun visor. I asked how much and he wouldn't properly say, then as I looked in my wallet he reached over and grabbed it, went through the notes saying there were lots of big ones, and pulled one out. I really thought it was a 100k bill (but can't be sure) …",

So we meet under a shady tree at Hoan Kiem lake on 11 November. It was a surreal moment for me as I've been in a toxic relationship and meeting her and going out with her while she shows me around made me think that she's so perfect. She has these ever-positive vibes all around and is lovely. She's graduating in August, and I plan to visit her during graduation as well. We made some happy memories by strolling around Ha Noi.

I'm little bit concerned about Typhoons as in my home country we do not have anything relatively extreme. I read on news that Da Nang experienced Typhoon Noru - saw the videos, images and heard that there was an evacuation in thousands, so got scared a bit and thinking - maybe just go back to EU and sip beers there without worrying too much, haha. \n I do plan to stay there for a month or two as DN.

Also, we read Da Nang is #3 hot spots in SeA. Based on these findings and recommendations, we booked ourself a good amount of time here.\n After spending 5 days in HCMC - which we really enjoyed - the experiences here in Da Nang didn’t really meet our expectations. We’re staying in the beach area, went to the city center, did Hai Van Pass & Ba Na Hills.\n We’re very curious about the history of this city. It feels like there’s put a lot of money into it years ago, but not very well maintained. Also they’re still building A LOT, while other properties seem unfinished.\n Is this city build to be Asias Dubai/Barcelona/Rio/Miami (since it has a beach)?\n We’re also looking for recommendations on what to do/see/eat here :)\n    submitted by    /u/edvrslit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Toilet paper of course but what if there's no TP? \n Do you flush first then use gun or flush after?\n How do you deal with water splashes on toilet seat?\n Tricks/tips from your master of this subject is greatly appreciated!\n Edit: I've never use it before in the US and I've been here couple weeks. Sure it's not rocket science to use it, just interest on how people optimize the use of it. I'm sure there's a preferred method for a guy vs girl. \n For me as a guy,since my junk, I lean forward and spray from the back. I tried spray only and use TP to check, sometimes it's clean and sometimes not. So I've use my left hand then with TP ready, wipe dry. This is where if you had a sink on top of the tank like some Japan toilet, you can wash your hands while sitting.\n    submitted by    /u/Vindicatenow  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sau một thời gian nói chuyện với tụi nó thì rút ra kết luận là kĩ năng nghe nói của mình quá kém T^T, nhất là khi nói chuyện với đứa UK và Úc. Không chỉ accent khác mà cách tụi nó đặt câu cũng khác quắc. Thí dụ khi gặp nhau UK hay hỏi \"Have you done much today?\" Lúc đầu mình nghe hổng ra cứ phải nghệt mặt ra hỏi lại, giờ nghe quen thì chỉ cần nó nói much là bắt bài được liền =)) nhưng vẫn là nghe được 50% của nó thôi không nghe ra được hết. Mình để ý cách tụi nó đặt câu hỏi và trả lời, và với cách mình được học cũng khác nữa, nhiều khi mình hỏi mà tụi nó không hiểu, nên thành ra ông gà bà vịt :))) để luyện tập thêm thì bên cạnh nói nhiều với tụi nó thì mình cũng coi show, program và để ý các nhân vật đối thoại rồi nhại theo, chứ cũng không biết còn cách nào khác không. Đặc biệt là nhiều khi muốn join conversation của tụi nó mà ko được cứ thấy vấp váp kiểu gì. Nói được 1 2 câu là ngưng nhảy số rồi. Mình muốn hỏi các bạn đã luyện kĩ năng nghe nói như nào vậy? Mình có tìm hiểu thì biết phải luyện theo intonation, schwa, diction. Các bạn luyện theo những phương pháp này thấy ổn hông? speaking của mình lúc trước cũng ko tệ lắm, 7.0 nhưng thấy cũng còn loay hoay quá. Hoan nghênh mọi ý kiến đóng góp. Any advice would help!

The only movie on Netflix they had was Dreamy Eyes (Mất Biếc) which was a pretty good love story, but not a comedy.\n In no way am I making an assumption based on the tiny sample size of the shows available on Netflix, but is comedy less popular in Vietnam as a form of entertainment?

          "description": "Hi. Just returned from Vietnam. My itinerary was roughly 4 days in tp HCM, 10 days up North in various places, then another 7 days back in HCM.\n I found that Hanoi was really active. Full of tourists, full of fun things happening. And most importantly, hotel accommodation was reasonably priced. Managed to get a good sized room with a balcony, at a good hotel, for around 650.000 in Hoàn Kiếm area, not five minutes walk from the lake. \n By comparison, on my second stay in Saigon, best I could get was a passable room in a really cramped hotel with paper thin walls, for about 1000.000/n. I did scour Agoda and Booking.com for better deals, but there weren't many to be found. \n And this despite there being very few tourists there (for some reason). That being the case, you'd think supply would exceed demand, and you'd get hotels dropping their prices in order to compete. \n Another example: In my first 4 day stint in Saigon, I got a nice room with a balcony, in a nice but slightly run down hotel on Để Thám, for around 835.000. I would have booked them for my second stay too, but for some reason, they decided to double the price after I left. \n I'm not whining. Just really puzzled by the economics of this.\n    submitted by    /u/DefamedPrawn  \n [link]   [comments]",

The crowd was almost entirely Western so I wasn't sure.\n \nWhen police drive through the streets saying things on the loudspeaker, what are they saying? People seem to move their mopeds but I wasn't sure.\n \nIs there any significance to the sunflower seeds people eat, or is it just a nice snack at the bar / restaurant?\n \nHow are tourists perceived in Hanoi? Do people (generally) have any anti-American or anti-Western sentiment? If so, is it generational?\n \nWhat are the attitudes of young Vietnamese people to the military? I know there is conscription but also it is relatively easy to get out of (?). Is military service considered a good or useful thing generally?\n \nAre the schools inside the city e.g. Old or French Quarter for rich people or are they local schools for everyone in the area?\n \nWhat might locals think about visitors' attempts to cross the road?

It also brings a sense of nostalgia about the traditional culture of Vietnam as well.\n What are your opinions about the Trạng Nguyên culture of ancient Vietnam?

I just can’t shake off the feeling that I’m being exposed to the dioxin. Even though it’s 50yrs ago, it’s not like dioxin has an expiration date.\n If it’s still in the soil, how does it NOT affect the (tap) water, fruits, plants and animals? For example: if tap water comes from rain, the rain first goes through the infected soil and is pretty much untreated (doesn’t really smell like chlorine). People here also say it’s safe to drink boiled tap water and I guess they make pho’s and coffee with it. But how about heavy metals like lead?\n We’re flying to Danang today and just the feeling of walking around that airport where that stuff was at 50yrs ago stresses me out.\n Am I overthinking it or is my stress legit?\n I feel so bad for the locals that this happened.\n    submitted by    /u/fliefloeflah  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm so excited and have so many questions, but first, I want to ask about this topic which I have seen come up quite often when doing my research about Vietnam.\n Somebody posted an article here a few days ago about culture shocks when traveling to Vietnam, and one of the first things on the list mentioned that it's common to see men publicly physically assault their wives.\n I have been doing a lot of research about Vietnam, and while I love almost every other aspect about it, this topic has arisen so many times that I feel the need to ask you people who live there and have been there before. So many articles mention that you will see men hit their wives and as long as you don't interfere, you will be fine, etc. This really concerns me because of some instances of seeing this in my childhood that really bothered me, so I am really worried about seeing this in Vietnam.\n How common is it really? I plan to travel to the major cities like Hanoi and HCMC. Is it actually a super common thing to hear and see domestic violence? It really makes me anxious thinking about having to see and hear this and not be able to help. \n I guess I get triggered when I hear or see domestic violence and am wondering if it's something that I am likely to be forced to witness on a regular basis in Vietnam.\n    submitted by    /u/Pollo_Perpetuo  \n [link]   [comments]",

There probably isn’t an airport in Ninh Binh so I might have to go back to Hanoi if flying is the best option.\n Hue to Nha Trang is also 11 hours by car, so maybe plane or sleeper bus again. I was considering doing the Hi Van Pass maybe from hue to Da Nang, if it would be easier to get from Da Nang to Nha Trang.\n Nha Trang to Phan Thiet by car is 4 hours, so idk about that one.\n HCMC to Phan Thiet is also 4 hours.\n If anyone has done a similar route before, please share how you traveled between these places and any other tips\n Also, if you have any other recommendations for places near the ones I have mentioned, or if you recommend skipping a city feel free to share:)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/unjverse  \n [link]   [comments]",

The food, the art, the culture, and the seemingly endless ebb and flow of motorbikes in and around the major cities. What always sticks out the most is the absolute tenacity of Vietnams people. They are \"get it done\" type people, which I have the utmost respect for. Vietnam has some of the most stunning landscapes you can witness from the northern Ha Giang mountains to southern mighty Mekong. Partnered by ever changing food dishes curated by the different distinct cultures. This place is somewhere I long to call home one day.

I’m looking for a real escape with some chilled time to heal physically, mentally and spiritually. I’ve had a tough few years for various reasons, one of them being my health. I have a problem digesting food due to an issue with my pancreas. Thus I need to eat mainly low fat, healthy food.\n Here comes my questions:- 1. Vietnamese food seems super healthy, and especially so in North Vietnam, where I read the diet is more simple. Would you agree? Cooking with too much oil is a killer for me, deep fried is a definite no and I generally avoid red meat.\n  \nI will have to bring medication with me (enzymes) as I need these when I eat. Has anyone been able to bring a prescription from abroad and use it in Vietnam? I live in Netherlands, Europe btw. I’d like to be organized with this in case I want to stay on longer. I have 6 months off from January.\n \nI’d like to do some kind of agri tourism while there, perhaps where food is grown and to be a part of this. I’d love to learn more about growing grains and plants, and it would be nice to involve with a community.\n \nStaying fit is super important to me, so I’d love to join a gym over there for a month, is this easy? My gut is telling me Hanoi is a good place for me to be for a while. Also I love to bike, is it common to cycle around Vietnam?\n \n Thanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/CheeryMoose  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can send and receive SMS messages with locals through the app.\n When I connect with people here and give out my number (American) if they're iOS it is fine since we can iMessage. But most are not iOS therefore they are hesitant to text (or some can't) because of the international number.\n I know there are alternative apps like WhatsApp and such.

I'd like to leave the USA in february to dodge part of the winter and go back to Viet to ride the loop. I remember that Hanoi was quite cold and rainy when I was there in January and I'd prefer to ride the loop when weather conditions are optimal. Is February too early to ride Ha Giang Loop? I can wait until early march if I must but going early february is preferred if conditions are similar. I am getting conflicting information as a I read articles about it. \n Btw I am experienced with riding a motorbike in viet countryside and am aware of issues with trucks and busses. Im guessing that I wont have problems with riding Ha Giang. I was thinking of a Honda Wave semi-Auto. It was reliable last time I did a trip around Vietnam and Im not practiced on manuals. Like many others, I am not going to be riding this legally.

Originally planned to be a 350kph/220mph-ish line, the 2022 version calls for a designed speed of 250kph/155mph and an operating speed of 180-225kph, or 111-140mph. The construction will take place from 2025 to 2041 in three phases, a nine-year reduction compared to the original plan. It will utilize electric multiple units as the rolling stock, with both passenger and freight versions running on double-track standard gauge (1435mm) rail, as opposed to the existing narrow gauge (1067mm). \n The line will be 1508km/937mi long, consisting of ~70 stations. The annual estimated figures for passenger and freight is 163M and 65M metric tons, respectively, with 142 pairs of passenger and 128 pairs of freight train running daily. The first phase (2025-2031) will comprise of a 361km/224mi line connecting Thu Thiem (HCM City) to Nha Trang. Following this, a line from Hanoi to Da Nang will be constructed from 2031 to 2038. The final phase (2038-2041) will involve connecting Nha Trang and Da Nang. Roughly $61.7B will be spent, with the majority (63%) coming from land acquisitions and auctions. 22% will come from state-funded sources, with private funding expected to be about 15% of the total budget.\n    submitted by    /u/Professional_Spray14  \n [link]   [comments]",

Does anyone know if there is rabies on Cat Ba Island? And also does anyone know if the situation I described is enough to transmit rabies?

          "description": "I speculated an alternate lore (short) where North Vietnam instantly invaded (or special military campaign\" in Laos to weaken the Western-dominated \"American\" alliance influence in Southeast Asia. Had Pathet Laos toppled the corrupted Vientiane government either in 1963 or 1964, then South Vietnam faced a peril where the newly communist Laos government planned to infiltrate Central Vietnam (South Vietnam) to prevent largely American forces gained on foothold across Central Highlands.\n Another POD is both Vietnams divided at the 16th Parallel (leaving Da Nang and southern branch of Thu Bon River under North Vietnam side). It would create massive chaos in Laos where communist North Vietnam easily determined to aid Pathet Laos to \"liberate\" Vientiane around early 1964 or 1965 (or even before 1968 Tet Offensive) depending on American military moodiness. North Vietnamese General Giap would like to see the size of NVA forces to orchestrate the moderately launched assaults of several Laotian towns and villages near the Vietnam-Laos border.\n With Laos under a \"socialist\" Vietnamese client state (regardless if Vietnam divided in 17th Parallel as per OTL or alternatively divided at 16th parallel), South Vietnam could faced intensified harassment from largely local \"VC\" communist forces near the South Vietnam-Laos border and even near provincial capitals in Central Highlands. This would lead the American government to seek peace talks with North Vietnam and Soviet Union secretly in a third country. If successful peace talks in mid-1960s, American could be saved up to 30,000 American soldiers and even save largely funds to fight against poverty in the domestic U.S. I generalized a possibly no Nixon as President of U.S in 1969.\n Can you think about ideas that devastated South Vietnam?\n    submitted by    /u/Thick_Broker6931  \n [link]   [comments]",

I love Southeast Asia and want to stay, but Saigon has ridiculous real estate pricing and interest rates on house loans. Also, crazy pricing for international schools, crazy traffic etc. So I've done some research and see many foreigners who moved to Malaysia and they seem to really love it. KL/Penang seem very developed with good public transportation, great real estate pricing even for luxury places, good mortgage rates, good tax situation for digital nomads, and international schools are cheap. Overall it seems like a clear upgrade over many aspects of Saigon (don't hate me for saying this, I honestly don't know, just read online).\n For some reason though my wife is not down with this idea. She doesn't like Malaysia and the culture there. I'm wondering what other Vietnamese people think of Malaysia and Malaysian culture?

          "description": "In the current debate surrounding Affirmative Action, many people evoke \"the poor Vietnamese who are uneducated and therefore need affirmative action\". First off, most schools don't consider the difference between South East Asians and East Asians. Secondly, statistics paint a different picture. Look at this table from Pew Research:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pik9p1w0h0y91.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=87eee2b83401f3d4349b212c79251d00db52dc14\n As you can see, Vietnamese born abroad, that is, the refugees, have low educational attainment. But for the generation that was born here, educational attainment is higher than whites. This, of course, contradicts the liberal narrative that Asians are doing better because of higher socio-economic status. Yes, they are correct -- many Vietnamese came to the US poor and without much education. But their children perform better than white Americans.\n The same story is told with income:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pocewmi4h0y91.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=4830d089be09f22dccae7fe3c065106b16ddc751\n So, pro-affirmative action advocates, stop using the Vietnamese as your token Asian minority to disguise your Asian racism.

I came across something online that said Vietnam has 52 tribes, and that most are in north Vietnam. That seems like A LOT for such a small place. I can google and find stuff on my own but I'm asking just in case someone might know some great material that I can read. It can be in Vietnamese. I can use Google Translate to translate the text. Thank you!\n I love this food YT channel based in Vietnam for going to visit the tribes around the world. This one is in Vietnam but I didn't catch which tribe it is. https://youtu.be/81aLMRK1ris\n These are all the tribes around the world that they visited.

I’m visiting for the first time in nearly five years next year and I want to work on my Vietnamese. I learned a small amount from my mom growing up (she worked long hours and did not have much free time) but I otherwise grew up isolated from other Vietnamese people. I’ve tried a few app/services and I’m currently using Duolingo. I am aware, however, of how specific the Hue dialect is, and I’m worried that I’m learning bad habits and potentially making myself even more unintelligible to my relatives. Does anyone know of any services that specifically teach the Hue dialect?

          "description": "Last week while I was travelling through Vietnam, I was going to fly from Hanoi to Hue and had a flight at 8PM. However, Vietjet decided to change my flight for 10AM of the same day. First of all, I had never seen any airline bring forward a flight before. Secondly, they refused to refund me the entire amount, and the only solution offered was a \"creditshell\", which is a credit I can use for future flights with them. Now that I'm back from vacations and can afford to lose some time with this, I wanted to ask if anyone had any success obtaining a full refund from them for a similar situation, or if this is a lost cause and I should just forget about the 70$ I paid. Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/bvdshec  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I’ve read a lot of writings where it is pointed out that MSG/bột ngọt aversion is originated from a 1968 racist research in USA. For me that explains why the western world is on the err side when it comes to MSG. \n Still I don’t really know why a lot of Vietnamese, my parents, people of their age, my age, and younger (Gen Z) is still very skeptical with MSG. They:\n  \n Makes an effort to avoid eateries/restaurants that they perceive to be using too much MSG\n  Claims that they’re nauseous or having headaches when consuming too much or any MSG at all\n  Avoid using MSG in their cooking\n  \nI do find 2-3 to be quite funny because Vietnamese are still using a lot of stock powder/bột nêm which is basically flavored MSG. \n Is there any knowledge for where this MSG aversion in Vietnam originates? Is it because of the 1968 study that carries to Vietnam during the war and persists thereafter? Do you experience 1 and 2 yourself? I do want to listen to you guys.\n Do you think MSG induced sickness is placebo effect?\n    submitted by    /u/neinherz  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's super lovely and the people are really nice, some of the cutest super lovely people I've met. But I can't walk down the street without people on their scooters stopping asking me for a ride, people selling glasses, chips, paintings, bracelets, necklaces, tours and private car tours. I get people have to make a living. Which is totally understandable. It's probably more a culture shock to me than anything. I can't walk down the beach without being asked by people every 40 meters I walk if I want to buy their things and knickknacks. It's gotten to a point where I'm starting to feel rude to these people.\n But they also can't take no for an answer and are really really pushy and persistent. What are some ways to get your message across that I don't want to buy without being super rude or guilt tripped into buying?

While traveling through Vietnam I am making a video about my trip and I am personally very interested in the fishing traditions of the Vietnamese. When traveling I really value meeting with locals and properly experiencing the places I visit rather than going through the regular tourist route.\n I’m posting to see if there is anyone in the Cat Ba/ Local bay areas that would be willing to show me and my film partner the local experience for a few days. I would love to learn about traditions, see how people in the area have lived, meet families, and fish! It would be amazing to have someone who can translate as I love to interact with local people but am limited by only speaking English.\n The person would need to be okay with being on camera and would definitely get some beautiful photos of them on the adventure!\n Edit: when I say local guide, I do not necessarily mean a tour guide. I am looking more for a local who is interested in making some new friends and wants to show off and educate about the Vietnamese culture\n    submitted by    /u/Ragingcrustacean  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically in Vietnam I have been using Duolingo without having to pay but still receive benefits like unlimited hearts, no ad and free \"purple\" test.\n While I was in Canada, there's heart limit and it costs 100 gems to do the test but as soon as I returned to Vietnam, it switches back to Vietnamese policy. I did change my Google Play account to Canadian to install a few apps there (I cannot change it back within this year).\n Yesterday I realized all the limitation is applied on my app as if it's Canadian and they offer me to try the Super thing with CAD currency. I am wondering if it's just somehow use Google Play account as location now or is it the new policy in Vietnam?

They are a place that provides shoe cleaning services, shoe repair, etc. As far as I know, the cost is quite expensive and Vietnamese people are willing to spend a few hundred thousand dong or even a few million just to make something for shoes. I don't know to you guys from other countries, do you guys do this? In my opinion, they are really too expensive and wasteful, why spend hundreds of thousands of dong just to wash a pair of shoes when you can do it yourself at home. Do people give too much importance to footwear when it is just an object to protect the feet.

Next year I would be hoping to get a 3 month visa and obviously more again as I come back. Is there a limit to how many times I can leave and return before immigration start asking questions? \n My current visa expires on the 6th November, I would like to go to South Korea for Halloween and come back but then I’d be on my 4th visa since 2018. Is it wiser to finish my time here and limit the amount of re-entries to this gorgeous country? Or am I overthinking!!?? \n Thank you! Cảm ơn!\n    submitted by    /u/rneatpie98  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n A friend and I are traveling to Vietnam for a month in December. We are renting motorbikes from Tigit and plan on first traveling north and doing the Ha Giang loop, then traveling south along the country towards HCMC. The Honda Winner is 200 dollars less from Tigit and I have read that they are more common and easier to have repaired. I have also read that the XR is comfortable and it seems like it would be better adapted for rough terrain. We are both well experienced with riding motorcycles; however, it is our first time in Vietnam and I understand how different it is. Taking the price difference into account, does anyone have any advice on which bike we should rent? \n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/bscottunit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I live in UK so I mostly use British pounds and I pay with card in most places. \n From what I read, I should have cash because in many places only cash is accepted. What is the best way to manage money as a tourist? I was thinking about the following:\n 1)bring cash (USD, would GBP be accepted at a decent rate ?) and then exchange it for the Dong once I am there\n 2)bring only a minimum amount in USD just to have money if needed and then withdraw money in local currency from an ATM. Are there ATMs often? Do they charge huge fees? \n I will backpack most of the trip so I would prefer to withdraw only a small amount of money at the time, I don't feel comfortable to have the money of two weeks of travel on me.\n    submitted by    /u/AcanthisittaSweaty16  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When you order a grab to the airport they may purposely take you to the wrong place. Then a taxi driver will explain that you are at wrong place and ask for a high price to go to correct place.\n My story: I told my initial grab driver i was at wrong place and after a few times of telling him it was wrong. He drove me to correct place reluctantly. I even tipped him.. I asked a security at correct place if it was in fact correct as i was second guessing myself. He was apparently working with them and told me to go ask someone at back. There were just more more grab drivers there. I was confused but i also didn’t want to be late. At this point I wasn’t aware of the scam and thought it was just a misunderstanding.\n New grab driver asked to pay to go to the initial wrong place saying it was the correct after i told him where i was going. Asks for stupid price once we arrived too. Thats when i detected a scam. But it was too late. Arrive there and thats when the taxi driver attempted to ‘help me’ (scam me) and drop off at correct place. And he will ask for money in us dollars. \n Overall the scam wasn’t much in my currency. But i was so angry at the situation that i left the taxi without paying and told him to F off. This proved to work as he barely even chased. Probably because the security working inside the airport werent involved in the scam like the outside security was.\n My advice: act angry and dont back down. It worked for me as i was legitimately pretty angry at how they were fucking with me and risking missing my flight and losing a lot of actual $\n    submitted by    /u/Garnservo97  \n [link]   [comments]",

We were thinking of buying motorbikes in the north, and riding from Hanoi to Saigon. \n The only thing is, my two friends don't have a driving license (no car, scooter, or motor) and have none or barely any driving experience, not even in the European country I'm from.\n I do have a driving license for a car and a scooter for some years (not for a motorbike) and would consider myself an experienced/good driver, but even I am quite hesitant about riding a motorbike in Vietnam. The odds for two (if i count myself in three) totally inexperienced motorcycle drivers to get into any kind of accident when riding in Vietnam for a month seem higher than acceptable to me.\n On top of that I'm worried about my friends, I don't want to see them in a serious accident in Vietnam, far away from home and without any insurance. \n They just shrugg it off and say it'll be alright and tell me I shouldn't worry about it. They don't seem to understand the risks. \n Are my concerns justified? I know it's almost impossible to go to Vietnam and not ride a motorbike, but I want them to at least understand the dangers and risks.\n    submitted by    /u/Exotic_Bandicoot_639  \n [link]   [comments]",
