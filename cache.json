My guidebook states that there is a parade with fireworks somewhere, but my host wasn't aware of this. Maybe you guys know?

I’m mixed viet and white, while I don’t believe I’m connected enough to get citizenship (grandmother is viet, I’m 1/4) we still keep in contact with family and visited 2013.

We are visiting soon again and I will consult people when I visit but was wondering if I’d be able to take some capital from the US and open a business over there.

I've selected Vietnam as my first teaching destination.\n -Monthly income? What did you actually make as an entry level teacher?\n -How many days did you really work each week? Was it exhausting? Start time & End time.\n -I plan to take Vietnamese language classes during my free time. Will I have time outside of work for languages classes?\n -What's the most efficient way to learn Vietnamese from scratch? I know its extremely difficult to learn. My goal is to at least be about to speak like a Vietnamese toddler after 1.5 years of practice.\n I'm also very introverted and at times a little closed off. I just have to fight that habit I have of isolating myself. Idk why I love alone time so much haha. But overall I have positive interactions with almost everyone and Im pretty approachable. I hope to come across people from all walks of life while in Vietnam. My parents are Nigerian but I was born in America so I got to experience two cultures growing up. I just love learning about other cultures.\n Lastly, how's dating/making friends scene in Vietnam?? I would like a social life. \n Is a long term stay feasible as an English teacher in Vietnam? Or at all as an English's teacher. I do hold a Masters degree, Im hoping that helps with future promotions after I gather more teaching experience. What do you think?\n I'm also a Registered Nurse in America. Im 35 years old. Im 6'3 and Black. Would I do best in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh?\n Advice, honest opinions and experiences are all welcomed.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Mammoth-Marketing-58  \n [link]   [comments]",

I figure I can stick to seafood and vegetarian options, but wondered if anyone had experience trying to eat halal or kosher (as I know both these follow a strict 'no pork' criteria) while in Vietnam.\n Thanks in advance :)\n ​\n Edit: Thank you to everyone who has offered advice. It's been extremely helpful as I was really worried I would be limited in experiencing the delicious cuisine. I will be taking u/meh2280 on his suggestion that bun cha is worth it - I just got some meds from the doc so I can limit my diarrhea to just a day or two and only eat it on days where we will be staying around our accommodation and relaxing! haha sorry if that was TMI. \n Special thanks to those of you who also translated some food names into english for me. This is going to serve me well. I can't wait to go to Vietnam! :)\n    submitted by    /u/hikimicub  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've seen a few different people say that it's always helpful to consume some sort of media in your target language to familiarize yourself with the sounds and pronunciation, even if you don't understand anything. This of course isn't going to be my primary method of studying but I'm sure it would be a useful tool, especially with English subtitles but that isn't a requirement. Does anyone have suggestions for something I could use that is mainly in the northern accent? I can listen to podcasts/radio shows at work, or it could be content creators or TV shows/movies for in my free time. I would appreciate any ideas!

Very nice people, I've only spoken to them briefly but they seem really nice and it's a great room and beautiful, quiet house!\n The wife of the family has been hard with me though...they were renting a room to somebody before that was there for 6 years, and I'm \"the new renter\" and she has been getting on my case for stuff that's pretty obviously just to give me a hard time and probably to test me a bit and see how I'll react perhaps? I'm not sure. She keeps telling me that if she doesn't like me that she'll just tell her husband and that they won't let me live there. \n The husband has been very laid back for the most part, it seems like she is just testing me somewhat and wants to make sure I'm a nice person and a good renter. \n Anyway, I wanted to ask is there some kind of gift I can get for her or the family that would show my appreciation to the family for renting the room? I'm fairly new to SoCal which has a large Vietnamese population as I'm sure you know, and I'd like to get the something as a housewarming gift and to show my appreciation.\n Thanks in advance, much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/goes231even  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not transgender or anything like that. It's just that my gaming hobby and skills aren't common in my job and profession. I'm also pursuing a master's degree, so I don't have time to find gaming buddies.

I am a foreigner - an American, and the situation is much the same in many parts of the country here. In addition to this, there has been a fairly constant push amongst some people to legalize marijuana here, and it seems likely to me that it will be made federally legal some time in the relatively near future (though I don't think the country is quite there yet). I was curious if it is the same for Vietnam - what is the general sentiment on marijuana laws? Do you believe marijuana should be legal in Vietnam, and do you think it will be soon, or do you think the current laws will remain in place for the foreseeable future, and why?\n    submitted by    /u/unnaturalfood  \n [link]   [comments]",

We will stay in his village (Đức thắng mộ Đức quảng Ngãi)for one week at his parents house.\n Problem is: he told me that in the past the military have forbidden foreingers to stay and sleep the night in this village. Apparently for 'security' reason because of some military zone nearby. We would have to book hotel nearby and visit his family during the day. Problem is that I do not find any official information on this interdiction and what are the exact restrictions. I would like to know the laws/rules so that I am not putting myself into problems.\n Questions: Are you aware of any official restrictions for foreigners in certain part of vietnam?

I am meeting my best friend who's been living in Germany for the last 8 months. It's going to be a fairly quick trip, and neither of us knows the best way to go about it.\n As it stands, we are meeting in HCM and we have a total of 16 days before I need to fly back from HCM to Australia on the 21st. Currently, we're thinking of spending 8 days in HCM and then another 8 days in Hanoi, as Google says Hoi An will have bad weather. I wouldn't mind going to Sapa as that looks good too, but I'm at a complete loss as to what to do and where to go.\n I have some general concerns as this will be my first time overseas from Australia and im not too sure what to expect. \n with that out the way the only solid plans I have are landing in HCM on the 5th of Oct and flying out on the night of the 21st. Any advice would be appreciated. Also, I just want to make sure I don't make any rookie travel mistakes during that time. I know there are massive differences in weather across the country during that period and Im mostly just looking to find the driest / sunniest place to go that time of year. Apologies in advance im just a bit confused as every website I see gives different advice and wildly different weather predictions. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Curious-Hour-5034  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As an (obvious) \"western\" tourist here, I often have the feeling you cannot walk more than 50 meters without someone approaching you who is after your money (especially in cities). In principle that's fine, it's natural that a lot of people earn money from tourists and have to approach them, so I do not mind. However this leads to me getting used to say \"no\" to basically everyone taking to me. \n Today I was walking to the post office (~20 min away) in HCMC with postcards in my hand, and someone driving by (regular guy, no grab jacket or anything) stopped and asked if I was looking for the post office and if he could help me. Out of habit I immediately told him no thanks, but afterwards reflected if I was being mean to someone genuinely wanting to help.\n Similar situations happened several times... So my question: am I being naive, is anyone offering help expecting a tip/money anyways? ( I was also asked for money straight away after someone helped me with a minor think taking 20 second, with rather ungrateful response after I gave only 20k.) Or am I being mean to people and assume they are just after money if they are genuinely nice? And how can you tell the difference?\n My common sense from \"back home\" does not really seem to apply here, hence my questions.\n    submitted by    /u/Square_Piano7744  \n [link]   [comments]",

I, in fact, has been doing it all the times, alone. I'm afraid it's just sentimental reasons though, It's just that have treasurable memory there. It was a very difficult time of my life, and someone invited me to go there with them. I remember just lying on the golden sand, gazing my eyes up on the blue blue sky, immerse myself into what felt like just emptyless. A big, blue sky and a boderless sea, just made you felt wanting to melting into them, merging with them, disappear into just some bubbles with them. Just plain peace and tranquillity, some tranquillity I deeply needed that time. It calmed me down, calmed my every torments down.\n From then, I always make chances to go there, just to lie on the golden sand again. I only chose when there would be least tourists, even if that means during a storm season. Storm, brings in another kind of tranquillity. \n But I'm afraid I might be biased. I always tell people that in Vietnam, I love Ha Long the most. I'm afraid the reason I love Ha Long is not for the fact it's actually great there.

          "description": "Hello, I am a person who loves Vietnam very much and has traveled here many times. My favorite destination is the sea in Vietnam, and I have discovered many beautiful beaches suitable for relaxation. Here are the top beautiful beaches in Vietnam that I would recommend:\n 1. Lang Co Beach, Hue\n https://preview.redd.it/pwikjgdh37kb1.jpg?width=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1c23e31562a1a517529d1b6210d53dd76dd40f5\n This is my favorite beach. Lang Co Beach is very clean and beautiful, as well as having a wild beauty. I am a person who does not like beaches that are too crowded with tourists and are interfered with by travel companies or resorts, so this is an ideal place for those who love natural beauty.\n 2. My Khe Beach, Da Nang\n https://preview.redd.it/inksi4zs47kb1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d44aeb8b8290eecbb18e5bd35d44ad093bd842e5\n Although it is pretty crowded with tourists, the scenery is still beautiful, and there are many exciting activities on the sea that you can participate in, such as playing volleyball, surfing, or. I highly recommend the Paragliding service Paragliding in Da Nang. Should join once in a lifetime to admire the city scenery and enjoy the beauty of Da Nang from above.\n 3. Mui Ne Beach\n https://preview.redd.it/2tzaoes737kb1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b9b48b16c9be0969a10ce85e79b64b51503ee36\n Mui Ne is suitable for resort tourism, with luxurious 5-star resorts along the coast. Mui Ne Beach will give you a feeling of peace, not hustle.\n There are also many beautiful beaches in Vietnam that you can refer to in the Top 10 beautiful beaches in Vietnam. I rate the shores of Vietnam as very beautiful, and next time I will evaluate some coastal resorts for those who intend to go to the beach for reference.\n    submitted by    /u/gabrielle3010  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't particularly wish to pursue a management position. I'm in a 4 year relationship and I can't bring myself to commit simply because I don't want to do this job for the rest of my life. I make about 10 bucks more an hour than when I first started which doesn't even make up for inflation.\n I'm willing to learn a new skill and study but I just don't know what other career paths are available to expats here. For the most part, I realise that many non specialist occupations can be filled by a native who will work cheaper than I will. My observation is also that a lot of Western businesses shut down after a year leading me to think that the govt doesn't make foreign business ownership easy.\n My question is what do I need to do to qualify myself for a job which will pay me enough to stay here?

          "description": "I’m not a Buddhist practitioner. I don’t go to temple. That being said I would like to start a discussion about monks from an observational pov. I frequent vegetarian places from bình dân food to restaurants like Bà Xã and I would frequently see monks. Nothing that sounds out of the ordinary, right? Most of the time I’ll see monks that would dine in pairs, usually eating in silence. Then there are groups of normies who accompany the monks, and sometimes one man or one woman with a monk. And this is a one time occurrence that I’ve had a friend tell me, he saw a ‘monk’ bring into a vegetarian restaurant his ‘ghệ’ and sneak in beer. He and his lover were kicked out of the establishment.\n So….. I guess I’m curious of a few things. Is it important for some people to want to build a rapport with monks? Is treating them to dinner a part of gaining good merit or something? And just how many monks out there are genuine, fraudulent, or in between with questionable morals?\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Assignment3182  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also between Hanoi and Ha Long?\n How different are HCM and Hanoi? Are they both worth the same amount of time?\n What is the public transport like in the cities? What is the best way to get around?\n What kind of weather can I expect during September?\n I obviously still want to be able to use my phone for internet while I'm over there. What's a good sim card option for tourists?\n Even though I'm bound to visit some bars during my stay, I'm not much of a drinker anymore. Is there anything else that's good to do at night in these locations that doesn't necessarily involve drinking?\n What should I expect to pay for things like food and drinks?\n What's the best way to see Ha Long?\n Is there any other advice you have for a solo tourist that might not be obvious to foreigners?\n Anyone want to hang out with a random Australian passing through?\n I did have some other questions, but I've forgotten them.

          "description": "Hi! So a little background is probably needed for this.\n I am currently living in Denmark as a sort of exchange student and recently went to a local Vietnamese place. I started speaking with the sweet lady who worked there and tried asking different things in Vietnamese. We got to speaking (it’s really funny cause our only common language is Danish, so neither of us were speaking our native tongue once we got past my very broken Vietnamese) and we had a wonderful conversation.\n At one point, after hearing my dogshit Vietnamese, but realizing I love Vietnamese food and people, she did the thing I’ve only ever seen before and invited me to her home. \n My question is, how do you respond to this? I said thank you of course, but do people ever accept the invite? Refuse? Is it rude to go or not to go? I’m not sure if it’s one of those things people say but don’t expect a follow through on, or if it is something where they want you to come. I don’t mind going at all, but I also really don’t want to impose. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. \n Ps: lady gave me a bag of pears too and refused to let me pay. She was so nice 😭😭\n    submitted by    /u/CubingB  \n [link]   [comments]",

They sell Phở and other kinds of noodle soup.\n But they also sell this dish. I don't know what's the correct name for it in English, but it's pork's brain boiled in water and added with some herbs. It's called \"Óc Trần\"\n So I came in and ordered a bowl of Phở. The owner nodded, signaling that he heard it. I suddenly felt the urge to eat that pork brain dish, I then spoke out loud to me, saying,\n \"Anh còn óc không vậy?\" Which is roughly translated to \"Do you have any brain left at all?\" \n The owner looked very shell-shocked at me, looking very confused. I thought he didn't heard me correctly, I spoke even louder, \"Anh có óc không ạ?\", which is \"Do you have brain?\"\n The whole stall and everyone on the tables were looking at me confusingly, and the owner looked even more shell-shocked! I still then didn't understand what was wrong, I told him that, \"Óc trần ạ!\", which is \"Boiled brain!\". He changed his facial expression immediately to smiling, lol\n Sitting down, I still didn't firgure out why he and other people looking at me that weirdly. It took me a few minites to realize how horrible that could come across, lol! In vietnam, if we tell someone that they have no brain, or ask them if they have brain or not, it means that we are insulting them and telling them they are dumb and stupid!

          "description": "Like, it's just suck. And here's why:\n  \nMemorization: While memorization IS a necessary skill for real life, it's one of the most useless one. There is loads of other skills an education system should focus on for helping students with later life. However, just look at the Vietnamese textbook. What did you see? IT'S JUST MEMORY! There is nearly no other skills. Critical thinking? Zero. Creativity? Zero. Heck, only logical thinking has some representation, and that representation is minuscule in my opnion. I can't think of a reason why don't they teach other skills rather than just memorization.\n Obsession over Grade: This is the worst problem by a long shot. Due to (let me check what it's called...) confucianism, the Vietnamese people value education. Don't get me wrong, this is a good thing, but for some reasons, it has turned into an obsession over grade and score. And well, just google \"bệnh thành tích\" to see how bad it is. Tbh, I think it is not exactly the fault of the Ministry of Education, but it's too popular to not mention.\n Underpaid teacher: Self-explanatory. This forced teachers to teach more in bonus class (idk how to translate học thêm, sorry) and create more stress to already stressed kid.\n Boring asf: Also self-explanatory\n  \nTbf, they are trying to fix these problem, and while they are not even close to fix these, theres still some progress. Hopefully they can fix all of this in near future\n (sorry for any mistake)\n    submitted by    /u/WhereGoodUserName  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've never experienced theft firsthand before and this experience has been not so pleasant in my memory. At noon time on August 22, 2023, I parked my red Honda Wave motorbike across from Eddie's Wok in Thao Dien. Specifically, it was a sidewalk with other parked motorbikes, so I figured it might be a parking spot, even though there were no guards. It was stupid of me to believe that surveillance cameras would deter any bike thieves. I stopped at Eddie's for lunch and when I was done, I found my motorbike to be missing. I reported it to the authority of phường Thảo Điền and it was all that I could do. \n I now realized that I was naive to park at a place with no security. I really liked that bike and I've had a lot of good memories with it. I also lost two helmets and a raincoat was on the bike.

          "description": "Hi guys!\n A group of friends and I booked a trip to Viet Nam on a whim because the flights happened to be quite cheap from Indonesia end of August.\n We will be landing in Da Lat which we were interested in because the city looks unique, and will be departing from Ho Chi Minh city. We'll be there 28th Aug to 7th Sep. Currently the plan is to be in Da Lat for 3 nights in the beginning, then in Ho Chi Minh City from 3 Sep onwards. This leaves the 31st to 3rd on our schedule empty for potential things we can do. \n Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do or places to go/stay on those middle 3 nights? Maybe somewhere off Da Lat and HCMC, or on the way between those two cities?\n For example we were potentially looking at checking Bao Loc out for something kinda off the beaten tourist path, but are wondering about how to get around within the city there. Is Grab readily available etc. \n Second thing we were wondering about is how reliable the inter-city buses are. We could find schedules but can't figure out how to book them online, so is it simple to go to the bus station and book tickets? How early in advance should we book them and do the tickets run out fast on the routes from Da Lat -> HCMC? Also would you even recommend going by bus between cities for tourists with no command of the Vietnamese language save for Google Translate camera? We were thinking of going by bus for a more affordable experience and to sightsee/experience how traveling through the country by land is, but of course a plane ride between the two cities is still an option.\n Really excited to visit Viet Nam as I've never been there and I appreciate any help you guys can give!

Trước khi lên đại học mình đã mong muốn và nghĩ rằng khi lên đại học, tập thể lớp sẽ rất vui nhộn như cấp 2 hoặc cấp 3, thậm chí là hơn cả thế, nhưng mà mình đã vỡ mộng hoàn toàn sau 1 năm theo học cùng lớp. Số buổi lên lớp của trường mình không nhiều, chỉ có 3-4 buổi mỗi tuần. Lớp mình là một tập thể không đông, trước đó thì có 20 người nhưng sau đó vì nhiều người không theo được nên đã chọn đổi ngành hoặc trường nên cuối cùng lớp mình chỉ còn có 14 người. Ngỡ tưởng dân số ít thì mọi người sẽ mở lòng giao tiếp với nhau nhiều hơn nhưng kết cục vẫn đâu vào đó, ai cũng khiêm tốn và kiệm lời, chẳng có sự sôi nổi, chẳng cãi vã, chẳng tranh luận, lớp lặng im, đã vậy còn chia thành các nhóm nhỏ khác rồi chơi cùng nhau trong vòng đó (đa phần quen nhau từ trước), mình cũng có một nhóm nhưng hiện tại thì chỉ còn mình mình vì những người khác rời đi hết. Biết trước chuyện này xảy ra nên ban đầu mình có giao tiếp hay lại gần để trò chuyện cùng các nhóm khác, nhưng mà nỗ lực có vẻ không thành khi mình ăn trái bơ nhiều và các bạn có vẻ không muốn tiếp tục cuộc hội thoại. Không chỉ trên lớp mà thậm chí trên mạng xã hội, mỗi lớp đều sẽ có một nhóm zalo để chia sẻ thông tin cũng như trò chuyện, nhưng mà kì lạ là nhóm lớp chẳng ai nói cũng chẳng ai hỏi, vài tuần thì có tin nhắn thông báo sau đó lại chìm nghỉm, mình nói gì mình hỏi gì cũng đều nhận lại được đó là một đống bơ từ cả lớp, trong khi mọi tin nhắn khác mình đều thả tim hoặc rep lại để tạo sự tương tác 😢 biết là chẳng có gì đáng trách nhưng cảm giác quá đáng thật.

          "description": "Suddenly feeling the urge to ask this question, because while the US is more well-known to be more open-minded about gender expression, I feel that the male beauty standard there is actually quite strict and harsh. \n I only see the most buff, shredded, muscular guys being presented in American movies and series, and only them is positively presented. The \"nerds\" and the skinnier guys are often portrayed as a joke, a laughingstock. This might be a blindspot of mine, and I might be jumping to conclusion too early with not enough observation. But I feel the male beauty standard in the West, or at least the US, is very big, very jock-like, buff-y, brute, masculine-ish.\n And while Asia, or Vietnam, is said to be more conservative, but I actually feel like we allow men to be more things. The big, buffy with tan lines image is accepted. Also accepted is the slim, fair skin, quieter, smart, sweet and soft-spoken, \"thư sinh\" type. Nobody has to be big and shredded with 6 packs to be considered a man. Am I right about this?\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate-Bit9246  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a 23M currently living in Hanoi. I'm the only male in my family, my mother has singlehandedly raised both me and my sister up. \n Anyone living in Vietnam, or especially the northern part of it, would certainly understand the pressure put down on the men in the family line to get married and have children. But the thing is that I'm gay, and I'm not planning anywhere in the future to deceive any girl into a marriage with a guy who doesn't love them, just for my selfish motivation, which is to \"fulfill responsibility.\" Despite having had many girls showing interests and some even confessing their love for me, it would just be a very cruel act to rob away a girl's chance of true love and happiness in life just for my selfish reason. \n And I don't want to have any kids either, even if I'm a straight guy. But my mother is getting older too, and she does deserve having a grandchild to care for, to have someone to brighten and bring her happiness at her later years. But even for that, I could just adopt a child, there's no need to lure a girl into marriage just to have a child.\n But I don't even want to adopt kids. Best case scenario, I found a guy who's my true love, we're both financially stable enough to be able to adopt and raise a child with love. Much more likely, I would end up alone, I much more prefer it that way though. Living to the very end of my 40s, then that's enough.\n Do you know anyone who's a Vietnamese, who chose to live like me, choosing to live alone for the rest of their lives? Do they got respected? Do other Vietnamese look down on them?\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate-Bit9246  \n [link]   [comments]",

Same go for video games. Don't even get me started on the propaganda movies, especially with the propaganda movies, propaganda war movies about war heroes are the easiest to make IMHO, should be easily State funded, so many war heroes to take inspiration from ( and if you're saying they aren't real because their story are too crazy, remember Hacksaw Ridge is based on a real story), so many examples from successful movies to take notes.

We currently live in Europe but probably want to move to Saigon in the future to be closer to my parents in law.\n  \nIs there anything we have to keep in mind about the citizenship of my wife? She is thinking of becoming Austrian citizen but unfortunately Austria doesn't allow dual citizenship, meaning she needs to give up her vietnamese passport. Can we still purchase real estate in Vietnam although none of us will be vietnamese citizenship? If we buy a property before she changes her nationality, will it have any legal consequences regarding the property?\n \nWhat are some recommended webpages to look for properties (south Vietnam, Saigon, Da Lat) online? (vietnamese only is fine)\n \nIs there any kind of public accessible data about average prices per square meter for different regions across the south of Vietnam?\n \nIs it common in Vietnam to hire an agent when buying a property which does the searching for us and asks for a reasonable commission? How would we go about finding someone professional?We are not searching for and cannot afford a luxury property. E.g. I doubt we can afford something in downtown Saigon.\n \nAny other obvious pitfalls that we should know of? I know that we are very much at the beginning of the process and we are both pretty clueless. I'm more of the \"handyman\" in the relationship but unfortunately I do not speak vietnamese yet and it's hard for me to research by myself. Hence it's a learning process that me and my wife have to go through together. \n \n Thanks a lot for any input and help!\n    submitted by    /u/brintal  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's a brunch of guys there, which I knew was very suspicious, so I chose to ignore them. \n  \nThe Grab driver then called and told me that he's about 20 minutes away, he's stuck in traffic and asked that I cancel the ride. I told him the app showed that he's on the other side of the parking lot. He hung up cause my internet was shitty, then we exchanged texts where we pretty much said the same thing a second time.

Despite this I don't mind them existing because they are easily avoidable.\n I am currently travelling in Vietnam and it would seem that the karaoke is impossible to avoid, generally because it is so loud and there are so many karaoke bars. Here in Dalat some of them seem to operate even in the middle of the day. Even the staff at my hostel do it (none of the guests seem to participate). This isn't just for a couple hours in the evening either, they seem to enjoy doing it constantly from 6pm to 10pm. 4 hours of this shit? Really?\n I suppose aside from ranting my question is why is everybody expected to tolerate this intrusive activity in Vietnam? Does everyone enjoy listening to this or do they just accept that it exists and move on?

Some said fixed prices some said give me your price. I tried halving but some “said sorry no we cannot do it.” Then we came to an agreeable rate But it was only the vendors I purchased from.

It seems to me like people here operate on the most extreme capitalist mindset even more so than capitalist countries. There are more social safety nets, social goods, social ideologies in Europe, Australia, or USA, than there are here. Just as a quick dumb example: there are way more parks and public areas in any of those countries than here. And the few ones that there are here always end up overrun with people trying to sell crap. In \"capitalist countries\" more people tend to agree collectively to leave public places for the public. They (usually) tend agree to pay taxes to fund all sorts of social services.

I got her instagram and we started to talk for a month. She was very enthusiastic (never one word answers) and flirty with all her responses except I always had to start all the conversations. I recently told her I was really interested in her but that it would be difficult for us to maintain a relationship being so far away from each other and she said she was interested too and that if we “really loved” then it would work. \n However, I went through her instagram followers and found her boyfriend that she has been dating for like 9 months. She doesn’t have any photos of him on her instagram but the boyfriend has all the photos of her on his profile. \n After finding out, I didn’t confront her about it and immediately stopped messaging her and she hasn’t messaged me either but that wasn’t surprising to me because I was always the one to start the conversations. I guess I can understand why now because she has a boyfriend… Even though, we haven’t talked for a week, she still shows interest by liking my instagram stories.\n My question is why would she deceive me like this and waste all of my time?

Then they took off their shoes and put their feet on another seat when we were on public transport. I understand their motives, I just couldn’t stand it. The things they talk about, I can’t join. The things they do, I am not comfortable to.

My Vietnamese speaking abilities is very bare-bones and simple. As such, when I went back to Vietnam, it was quite easy to identify me as a Viet-Kieu the second I opened my mouth.\n Now this prompted some thought and curiosity within me. For the typical local Vietnamese person, is it possible to identify the country that the VK person is from based off of their speech pattern/accent?\n Furthermore, do foreigners from different countries have different accents when speaking Vietnamese? For example, in the US, there is a distinctive difference between Latinos speaking english, Asians speaking English, Europeans speaking English, etc. As well, within those groups, you have subtler differences too. Like the French accent is different than the UK English accent. Vietnamese people speaking English have a different sound to Japanese people speaking English.

Is it “authentic”? \n Both of my parents are from vietnam but i was born in america, so i wouldn’t say i was an expert on viet cuisine but i wondered if this is more of a fusion dish like orange chicken.

It is just so embarrassing every single time.\n Yes, Some polite behaviours are relative, however there is still a core set of behaviours that is consistent everywhere, such as, do not block the path, do not spit on the streets etc. One can’t just hide behind the concept of relativeness and ignore reality altogether. \n I am both sad and angry because I know the Vietnamese are capable, but they just refuse to change or listen to criticism.\n Edit: Future readers can observe the comments and judge for yourself.\n    submitted by    /u/lostyoungman2k  \n [link]   [comments]",

They weren’t actually working, just long term hanging out.\n So for my expats who DO make a living contributing to Vietnam’s prosperity, what are some of the usual occupations expats do?\n My most current occupational background is in aviation maintenance , but I also have a masters in International Relations, and over 20 years of kitchen/food prep/food service. \n I saw that there’s no “pensioner visa”, which would be nice because I’m expecting a pension of around $3000/month in about 5-8 years, but I don’t mind working past my first retirement.\n    submitted by    /u/hellequinbull  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Theo Tòa án tối cao Hoa Kỳ, trước khi thẩm vấn, cảnh sát phải thông báo cho nghi phạm hình sự như sau:\n \"Anh có quyền giữ im lặng và từ chối trả lời câu hỏi. Bất cứ điều gì anh nói cũng sẽ được dùng để chống lại anh trước tòa. Anh có quyền có luật sư trước khi khai báo với cảnh sát và luật sư sẽ hiện diện khi cảnh sát thẩm vấn anh. Nếu anh không thể tìm được luật sư, anh sẽ được cung cấp một luật sư trước khi trả lời các câu hỏi. Anh có thể trả lời câu hỏi khi không có luật sư, nhưng anh vẫn có quyền ngưng trả lời bất cứ lúc nào để chờ sự có mặt của luật sư\".\n Điều này có nghĩa là không ai được phép cưỡng ép nghi phạm trả lời bất kỳ một câu hỏi nào khi không có mặt luật sư và trước khi ra toà thì nghi phạm cứ giữ im lặng thoải mái.\n Các quyền này là cơ bản trong nhân quyền và được áp dụng ở tất cả các quốc gia dân chủ. Theo tao nghiên cứu thì luật tố tụng hình sự Việt Nam không có điều nào thể hiện rõ những quyền này cả. Vậy nên bức cung, ép cung nó mới phổ biến và gây ra nhiều vụ án oan sai.\n    submitted by    /u/dominus108  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I've been to Asia before and was in Hong Kong in april myself to visit my family along with my gf.\n I am wondering if I should be taking any preparations food wise , as I am aware that the food hygiene is not that great. I also don't want a repeat of what I experienced as a kid in HK 20 years ago (diarrhea and the shits and vomiting) lol. In my experience, it was herbs and ice water that gave me problems, but I was wondering if I should be more careful?\n Second question is -Im bringing a camera along with me for travels, but its quite an expensive camera. My girlfriend was discussing this with me and told me to be carefeul about it being snatched. Therefore I am wondering i should take extra precautions with getting a security strap thats securely anchored so that no body can just snatch it away from me.

What places should we cover and what are absolute gems? Is safety a concern we should have? I am from India bdw. We are planning to book a return flight from a different city than the city we will be landing in since we wish to cover many places. Also, we will be in Vietnam for around 10 days. \n I also wanted to confirm if USD is accepted everywhere. We will also be carrying Forex cards. \n I really apologize for so many questions.

AFAIK, it’s very popular among younger readers. \n Fun fact: Ayn Rand was extremely vocal against the Vietnam War believing Communism would have collapsed without intervention (lol?) while the voice of America, John Steinbeck, publicly supported the war (in private, it was more complex than that). He also famously hated ideological orthodoxy i.e even calling champagne socialists “temporarily embarrassed capitalists” (sound familiar?).

Flex tí nhưng, ai cũng sẽ tưởng một đứa thế này thì lo quái gì. Em thành thật em khá lo về cái long run cho sự nghiệp. Em đang học tài chính vì nó hay và rộng nhưng em thật sự chưa biết cái gì phù hợp. Cái chính là ở đại học em chưa biết nên chú trọng cái gì ạ, em có thử tham gia các CLB nhưng failed. Em cũng muốn đi thi case nhưng chưa đủ kiến thức. Em còn định thưc tập nhưng chưa có công ty tuyển. Địng hướng của em đang định vào big3 consulting hay big4, em cũng khá muốn làm về data hay business analyst. Nhưng em lại thấy khá nản và yêu cầu rất cao kiểu em not good enough. Hiện tại em thực sự mê consulting và em cần một số lời khuyên để nổi bật ạ. Em thấy bản thân đang khá phai mờ, tại vì có quá nhiều cơ hội trên đại học và em không biết nên đầu tư vào đâu. Em thấy mình khá vô dụng, đại học nhiều người giỏi lắm nhưng em không biết học đến đó bằng cách nào huhu. Em không muốn 4 năm tuổi thơ mình chỉ có học, xong chơi, làm mấy công việc kiếm tiền qua ngày rồi bị đá ra ngoài xã hội loay hoay nhìn bạn bè phát triển.\n    submitted by    /u/Adventurous_Body2019  \n [link]   [comments]",
