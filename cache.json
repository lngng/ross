Some don’t look really hygienic. \n Could anyone recommend their favorite restaurants and/or food stalls in Hanoi?

They would claim the government required this to report us to the local establishment. We had one bad incident where the hotel has bugs and we requested to leave immediately, but they would not give us our passports until we paid them (even though we didn't stay more than an hour). \n Is this still a standard practice? To clarify, we did stay at local establishments, not corporate companies, like Hilton. First, we had concerns if we would even get our passports back, and our other concern was if something should happen while we were exploring that we would need it.

I’m from America and her grandfather is Vietcong who still hates America so he was apprehended to meet me - he didn’t even want to meet me in the first place.\n During our daughters first birthday I was able to meet her extended family and someone must have said something because grandfather showed up. He said he was relieved I was not white, they had only told him I was American so he didn’t know I was Mexican American. He bid me to drink rice wine with him and he was very friendly after I told him California and Texas were taken from Mexico. He replied ‘you’re not American by choice!’\n Let me tell you this wasn’t an experience I thought I would ever have.\n    submitted by    /u/RoGStonewall  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nếu nghỉ chỗ này thì chỉ biết đi xin làm phục vụ chỗ khác. Chứ cũng chẳng biết làm gì khác. Dù cv phải tiếp xúc với rất nhiều người, va chạm đủ thứ khiến mình một đứa hướng nội thiếu tự tin choáng ngợp và tụt năng lượng chỉ muốn rời chỗ làm ra chỗ chỉ có một mình. Mình thấy khó khăn trong suy nghĩ tâm lý và mình ko hợp làm việc tập thể, mình thấy mình khác biệt.\n Còn tự tạo công việc online nào đó trong phòng mình thì mình thấy chán chường, có những yếu tố con người nhà toxic, những lời lẽ cay nghiệt khiến tinh thần mình như bị nhấn chím xuống ko làm đc cái gì...

I am trying to decide if I should try for Peace Corp in VN (that is if I get accepted/I pass the medical exams), or try for TEFL.I am trying to see if I should try applying for Peace Corp in VN or just do TEFL in Vietnam. I am currently doing an English teaching volunteer experience as of now (soon I might get a temporary teacher's assistant position), graduated already with a bachelors and have a TEFL cert. My Vietnamese is at A2 (heritage speaker) and I am working to improve it.\n My goals is to see more of the culture in everyday life and learn more of the language. I am unsure of the pros and cons to either option. That being said I would like to do Peace Corp at some point in my life. Either way I would need to save up it turns out when the VN cohort leaves is approximately around the same time I plan to leave.I see that by the time of this year, I will probably be at a low B1.\n My main concerns are really if I would be able to learn the language to around B2/C1 by the end of the two years (plans are to continue taking classes and studying, as well as using the language as much as I can). I did post in the TEFL and peace corp subreddits but I wanted to get some perspectives. I was recommended by a user on r/expats to post here too.\n Originally my plan is if I get accepted to Peace Corp in VN (assuming I get accepted and pass the medical/legal exams) and I go, I would do it for the entire duration and then evaluate. If not, I would do TEFL for two years and then evaluate. Right now I graduated but I haven't found anything in my field and I figured I might as well get my Vietnamese to advanced since that is what I wanted to do since I was a kid. I could go back to the States and do a different career afterwards, sure I would be setback but I don't have much to lose.\n I would also like to see if anyone has experience doing either TEFL or Peace Corp or something similar to what I am wanting to do.\n    submitted by    /u/throwaway_071478  \n [link]   [comments]",

He has an estranged son (none of us know him or are in contact with him) and while my other uncles and mom was handling the death certificate, the US consulate was able to get a hold of his son. Unfortunately his son considered some options verbally but stopped responding, so there’s nothing in writing. There is no will. My uncle also has no assets.\n We have the means (and want to) bury him as we have a family cemetery in VN. It seems like my parents and other uncles couldn’t get permission to move forward with the burial. How does next of kin responsibilities work? Can’t they just keep going down the line of kin if the first one doesn’t take action? I’m just sad that his body is stuck at the hospital indefinitely and none of us can get closure.\n I also don’t want my family to get in trouble if they attempt to get the body from the hospital. Does anyone know if we should try to get a Vietnamese lawyer involved or if there’s anything more we can do?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/preciousstime  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want their names to have meaning and it’s important to the story but I also want to show respect to the Vietnamese language and naming practices. I understand that the way a Vietnamese name is written is Surname/Middle name/Given name and that the person is always greeted by their given name but (so I have read). I really don’t want to just use google translate and total screw it up and come off super ignorant. I understand that Nguyên is the most common surname in Vietnam so I have already chosen that surname for my Vietnamese characters. They are supposed to have common names as I’m trying to have them represent a large part of the general public on both the Vietnam side of the story and the American side (Smith is the surname of my American characters). So as for the Vietnamese names I need help finding something that works for:\n Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Bright Moon (feminine, born 1930)\n Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Day Star (masculine, born 1925)\n Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Night Star (masculine, born 1951)\n Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Caring Soul (feminine, born 1932)\n Thank you so much, I appreciate anyone who can give me a hand. \n Justin\n    submitted by    /u/Fuddy-Fee  \n [link]   [comments]",

They immigrated to America when they were in their early 20s, so I was born and raised there. My mom's talking to our cab driver about how much Vietnam has changed then as well as the cultural and value differences between the two countries. Specifically their conversation about family values had me in tears. I knew that Vietnamese culture has a very heavy emphasis on family. Most times, you got whole generations living in the same house. Everybody is constantly supporting and looking after one another like parents will provide for their kids regardless of their age. Similarly, even after the children are all grown up, they stay behind to take care of their family. However, American family values is not like that. Sure children love their parents, but they're quick to move on and live their life as soon as they're able to support themselves. Which I would say is true. Lot of kids try to move out as soon as they hit 18 which is considered a transition to adulthood. I think a good amount of them will use college as their escape from home. My brothers and I all have goals to move out, start our own careers/lives as soon as we're able to, and she's expecting to probably go to a nursing home when she's unable to take care of herself. I just honestly feel so guilty and sad that she feels like that. Of course I want to be able to take care of my parents. I don't want to stick them in the nursing home but at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in the same place until it's my parents' time. I haven't thought about anything like that til now, and I'm not really sure what I would even do. \n    submitted by    /u/Character-Cut1014  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the other hand, I notice much more diverse clientele at, Italian, Japanese, Thai, and (westernized) Chinese restaurants. When I lived in Australia, however, there were a lot more non-Asians eating in Vietnamese restaurants.\n For Australia, I know that Vietnamese have a longer history there than in New Zealand, and people are thus much more familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, but I still found it interesting how Vietnamese food seemed to be proportionately more popular among non-Asians in Australia than among non-Asians in New Zealand, despite the fact that Australia and New Zealand are neighboring countries.\n So, out of curiosity, at Vietnamese restaurants in Vietnam and other countries, how popular are they among non-Asians?

When visiting the Mekong delta we stopped at a little village producing coconut candy and snake wine. Tried it, liked the taste and decided to buy two bottles to drink with friends once I get home. \n My questions are:\n 1) The bottle says NSX 1.12.2023., after googling NSX I found out it means manufacturing date. As far as I knew snake wine has to ferment with the snake in it for about 3 months and only a month and a half passed since this was produced so is it drinkable?\n 2) My tour guide said after finishing the bottle it can be reused by adding other strong alcohol for about a year, is this true?\n 3) Anyone know what the little branches are in the bottle?\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/oli38ql4oocc1.jpg?width=627&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd0d2ed53262ca61b04acd6c66f13275f03f267b\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/b7yr9wn5oocc1.jpg?width=830&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daf726a930840ed4d0fce0480c4991fcae54b7db\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/nbt2b8i6oocc1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5feaaa4e689411d0aef4636305bf5fd14541aa7a\n    submitted by    /u/Nazeboo231  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ended up giving him $20 (500k VND) just because I liked him and was inspired by his story given that I’m a traveler too. \n He added me to his WhatsApp and told me that he would text me when he makes it to New York so we can meet up again.\n It was all very sweet and whether it was a scam or not, I don’t feel all that bad about it.\n But I am just curious whether you think this was a scam or genuinely just a dude trying to follow his dreams?\n    submitted by    /u/Puzzleheaded_Cup4369  \n [link]   [comments]",

Question: Did she retain Vietnamese citizenship to this day?\n I am reading about the laws and it is very confusing given multiple changes in the past decade. In 2009 Vietnam recognized dual citizenship and said those who had left Vietnam prior must renew their passport to retain citizenship. This was extended to 2014 as very few did it.

I stayed with her in her apartment for five days and she basically treated me like I was her boyfriend. She spent a lot of time with me, showed me around, gave me her motorcycle and instructions to explore while she had to do some work. She took me out, cooked for me and even did my laundry. We slept together. And we got to talk and get to know each other a little bit.\n I've never experienced anything like it. She is a very attractive, smart young woman. \n After leaving and coming back to Saigon I felt I wanted to spend more time with her before going back to Europe in a couple of weeks, so I told her that I'd like to see her again. She said I was invited again and that I can stay until I need to go back to Europe (two weeks). I slept on it and decided that I actually want to spend some more time in the city before going back and that spending that much time with her might be too much for me. We then spoke on the phone and I told her that I'd like to come again for 5 days and she got upset and offended that I didn't want to spend all of my time with her and told me it's better we don't see each other then.\n And that was it. I actually wanted to spend more time with her and see where things could possibly go, but it would have been very difficult because she lives and works in a more rural area.

We were planning on starting our Vietnam portion of the trip around the 8th-10th of February, entering from Cambodia into HCMC. We’ve recently been informed that Tet celebrations are during this period. I am personally blaming the fact that we have done the least amount of research on Vietnam as it is the last destination of our trip as to why this was new information to us.\n We have since done a bit of research and have seen conflicting opinions on how much will actually be open/ what we will be able to do in HCMC during this period and was wondering if anyone here would be able to enlighten us. While we think the idea of getting to see the celebrations would be a really cool opportunity, we also don’t want to be stuck in our hostel for days and struggling to find food to eat etc. If this was the case we may extend our Cambodia section of the trip and travel to HCMC at a later date. \n Thanks very much\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Daikon3049  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's no need, and you don't have to idle around under the sun's burning heat in hope of being able to \"fish\" someone\n For all the reasons I mentioned, I don't quite comprehense why drivers don't just all stop doing the old-school way and choose the digital road.\n I get it that not everyone can afford a smart phone, but the budget line of samsung for example is 1 mil, and usable enough to run Grab. I also get that most old-school, traditional drivers are older folks, who might not know how to use a smart phone. But it's a thing that can be easily taught and learned, just how to use that one specific app, when to click this and that, not the whole phone system\n I know I might sound dumb and entitled, but I have no bad intentions and really want to know why.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Arugula6148  \n [link]   [comments]",

According to my research, I noticed that the medication is illegal but previous reddit threads have said that nobody really cares if you bring it in, and it is fine if you use it only for yourself with medical usage while there short-term.\n If I did bring the Sudafed with me into Vietnam, is there any chance that they would be checking for that while I enter the country at my arriving airport? If I did bring the medication with me into Vietnam, what are the odds of me getting caught, and what would be the potential ramifications? I am just trying to judge the risks, I know I may be sounding a bit too paranoid.\n What would you all recommend? Would it be ok to bring into the country with me or should I leave the Sudafed at home?

The Vinhomes Central Park area offers just that.\n That said, I've read complaints about Vingroup, as well as Vinhomes. Specifically reviews are saying the house loses it quality after a few years with cracks on the wall and water damping, a bunch of issues that aren't easy/cheap to fix as an individual.\n Anyone who has stayed there for awhile can shed some light for me on the apartment quality itself? My main concerns are is the infrastructure (stuff that are behind the wall that I cannot see or buy something on Shopee to replace) and how much maintenance effort it is going to take me years down the line.\n Thanks all.\n    submitted by    /u/ngocminh12697  \n [link]   [comments]",

While we were eating three dudes speaking Mandarin walked in pretty loudly (even for Chinese people lol) acting like they owned the place. They were pointing around and looked to be directing the employees. Both of us immediately noticed and exchanged a look. One of them was particularly intense, staring around the room and generally having a hostile vibe. He was making his sauce and one of the ingredients was empty and he practically screamed that they needed more. My wife said the employees looked scared when they walked in. They also grabbed one of the display bottles of alcohol off the top of the sauce bar and shared it. Neither of us were that concerned because we know messing with random people only brings unnecessary attention, but it was very obvious these dudes felt comfortable doing what they wanted in this restaurant. It was interesting and I wonder what other’s thoughts are, or if anyone has had a similar experience.\n    submitted by    /u/kekimus-maximus  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since we will have children with us, I also want to make sure that the reliability of the flights will be fairly decent.

Usually alot of data isn't reliable since there are so many nuance situations relating to salary which is never covered. I've always THOUGHT and HEARD that hcmc has roughly about 20% to 30% higher cost of living than hanoi and the wages are also about higher to the same degree. Having recently lived in hcmc I've been hearing mixed opinions from a few people including locals and business owners who scouted to market to hire talent in both cities. Some lived in both and said it's the opposite and people in hanoi generally earn about 20% than hcmc. Others say hcmc is the highest in the country. What are your thoughts. Go ahead and argue, debate, whatever, GO!\n Btw im talking about typical salaries for vietnamese locals, not foreigners which are typically higher.\n    submitted by    /u/BuyHigh_S3llLow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I (41F) traveled solo to Vietnam last year. Before meeting up with my group in Hanoi, I decided to treat myself to a full body massage (as it was listed) at my hotel’s upscale spa. The women there were extremely kind and accommodating. I was given throw away undies to put on and a robe. When I laid down, she had me lay on my back with my breasts fully exposed, which was somewhat uncomfortable. She proceeded to massage my bare breasts for quite a while. I kept thinking to myself, “dont be rude this may be their culture, let her move on to another area…” but when she did, she kept revisiting that area. I eventually told her that area was fine and to focus more on my legs and back. My question is…. Is this normal in Vietnam?\n    submitted by    /u/beltedqueenfisher  \n [link]   [comments]",

My partner and I did a deep exploration, and at the end of the trip, we crossed paths with a monk. We greeted him, and he smiled and greeted us back. I was walking behind him and asked if he was heading home for the day. He replied that he was actually about to have dinner, and then, to my surprise, asked if I'd like to join!\n This took me aback. I hadn't heard of anything like this in reviews or posts about the Marble Mountains. He led us to the dining area and asked us to wait. I could see him discussing with the elder head monk and kitchen staff, who seemed hesitant at first. But soon, we were seated with them in the dining hall.\n It was surreal. The monks were full of laughter, jokes, and playful teasing throughout the meal. After everyone finished eating, they encouraged us to keep filling our plates, and the kitchen staff even came out to chat and ask us questions. Then, they surprised us again by inviting me back for breakfast the next morning at 9am, promising it's even more fun then – \"almost like a party,\" they said.\n So, I'm wondering if anyone else has ever had such an unexpected encounter? Or did I just experience something truly unique, a memory I'll forever cherish as a stroke of luck?\n    submitted by    /u/mybfisabear  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Does this sound familiar? Yes of course there are extremely nice people in Vietnam, but I believe every country has people who are nice. This could be controversial, but the reason why some foreigners say that is because they are white (or black even), so they get the preferential treatment. Cos they look different. By speaking a little Vietnamese, the Vietnamese people are super impressed and treat you even better. Vietnamese people are a curious bunch and they haven't gotten much opportunity to interact with a white/black person.\n Can I say the same for how Vietnamese treat each other? How about foreigners who are from SEA and look exactly like a Vietnamese? I fall into the second category, and typically Vietnamese only treat me a LITTLE better after they realise I'm a foreigner (vì nói chuyện hơi lơ lớ). I run a small food business and I see ALL kinds of people. Conversely, if I were white, I'd imagine it to be a whole lot different.\n So yes, Vietnamese people can be friendly (just as any other country) but it really seem like an overstatement to say that they are some of the friendliest people in the world.\n Edit: Just wanna re-emphasize that I am in no means trying to say Vietnamese people are not friendly or ill-mannered or whatsoever. Every country has both nice and nasty people. I'm just saying Westerners getting preferential treatment shouldn't be mistaken that Vietnamese ppl are the friendliest people in the world.

          "description": "As in the title. \n I have been here for some time. I know the country well. There were times I was thrilled to be here. \n But since the Covid period there has been a gradual decline in my view of living here. \n Part of it I think personal - me needing pasteurs new. Part of it I think is environment - my surroundings. \n The volume levels, trash, air and water pollution, huge overdevelopment and bewildering approach to governance has me unhappy. \n I think knowing I can never be a citizen, I can never buy property, and things like have police doing random passport checks at my house now at 2am has something to do with it to. As much as i've loved the country, it doesn't love me back or accept me and it never will. \n Curious to see if I am an outlier in feeling this way, or if anyone else has similar feelings. If so, i'm interested in seeing if this is just a phase and will pass, or whether I am in a downward spiral towards inevitable departure. \n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/HomoSapien908070  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to fly out of the country next month to Thailand. \n The only airline that allows my pet on board with me appears to be Vietnam Airlines. When I explained the dimensions of my dog’s carrier the employee told me it was too big. Truthfully, my dog’s carrier is hardly bigger than my dog itself as it is. So any smaller is hard to fathom.\n She told me the required measurements. I have looked online like crazy. I’ve seen small kennels and even extra small kennels. I have not seen any kennel available for purchase that is under the maximum allowed measurements (30cm X 35cm X 20cm).\n It has to be a solid constructed kennel which makes it more difficult and narrows it down even more. The carrying case I flew with is a fabric based one so I couldn’t use a same style for this airplane apparently.\n Does anyone have an idea where I could find such a kennel? Would be very grateful for any help!\n    submitted by    /u/Educational_March_75  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wind down my window and I can see he was taken aback that there was someone behind. I shouted at him \"Use your fucking side mirror\".

Today I tried to go stock up on things like toilet paper, bin bags and some kitchen essentials. I tried two different shops which were described as ‘supermarkets’ on Google maps and I couldn’t find these, even when I asked the employee (using Google translate). Are there specific shops for these things? I also try to track my macros and this is difficult to do when eating out / ordering in so I want to cook some of my meals at home, i haven’t yet found a shop where I can buy chicken, veg and stuff like that. What’s my best bet? Is it markets? If so, can anyone suggest a good one? For reference I’m staying at the edge of the My An area. \n Another thing, I would like to hire a moped to get around the city, can anyone recommend a good hire place for this? I have an international driving licence but not for motorbikes so I need something with a smaller engine, is this available here? Alternatively, how likely am I to get stopped by police when driving around? I’d like to drive myself to hoi an but I don’t want to risk a fine if I get a bigger bike without having a licence for it. I would also like to do the hai van pass but I don’t know if that would be possible on a 50cc as I’ve heard it’s hilly.

I’d like to have affordable accommodation for a couple months at least to get my bearings. Thanks so much all!!!\n    submitted by    /u/skyfishrain  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm Nigerian and his background is Vietnamese, but his ideals are more in line with Western cultures.\n When I see his parents we get along and I always have dinner with them, if I'm staying I make sure to clean up after myself, not get in their way and also do the dishes when his mum makes dinner for us.\n Recently I had a problem since he's going to get busy soon as he's starting a new business so I stayed with him and his parents for around 6 days. He thought it wasn't a problem but when I went to work his mum told him that it wasn't my home and that I wasn't his \"partner\" so I shouldn't be staying there for so long.\n I then messaged her to apologise the next day and she told me that in Vietnamese culture an unmarried girl cannot stay at her bfs house for too long and it's fine if it's a couple of days or a weekend.\n My boyfriend also stays at mine for over 6 days sometimes and my parents are fine with it, but I think it's a difference in culture. Could someone help me understand more about this and let me know things I should be more aware of? \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/toffieetoftof  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've gone through lawyers before when I obtained my TRC through setting up a business here and tbh, I ended up doing all the work. All they did was go physically submit my papers.

It's like the video is slowed down, but the audio stays at normal speed. Also the file size is really small compared to the original recording. It's like Zalo is re-encoding the video and screwing it all up😅\n Only noticed it recently, and the issue is happening to both me and the recipient.

I think everyone knows him. all his videos have eng subs.\n 2 NGÀY 1 DÊM VIỆT: This is the Vietnamese version of Korean show called 2 Days & 1 Night. They are still working on the subtitles.

          "description": "I have just come back from vacation in Phu Quoc. I met this amazing guy who works as a waiter at his family’s restaurant. When we first saw each other - we couldn’t stop staring. It felt like my body was immediately set on fire when we made eye contact. I went to the restaurant every single day, at least twice a day. We never had a real conversation but we were always looking at each other. \n When he was taking someone else’s order - he couldn’t stop staring at me - his dad had to tell him to “stop staring at that girl & focus on taking the order”. He’d play songs that I suggested & we’d dance together - all while maintaining eye contact and smiling ear to ear at each other. \n I was absolutely dying to get his socials & stay in contact but I couldn’t muster up the courage to just ask & when I finally did - he wasn’t there. \n On my last day - I stayed at the restaurant from breakfast till closing time. He gave me my favourite orders & drinks for free because I told him I’d be leaving that night. \n Now that I’m back home - I have this huge empty feeling of loss - deep inside my stomach. Thinking of him makes my chest hurt & feel heavy. I can’t stop myself from crying when I think about his face smiling at me. \n In those few weeks of endless tension, smiles & eye contact - I had never felt happier. He makes me feel alive just by looking into my eyes. He makes me feel absolutely blissfuly happy in a way that I’ve never felt before & I’ve never even properly spoken to him. \n I am desperately planning to go back to Phu Quoc later this year because I feel physically sick at the thought of never seeing him again. \n Idk what it is - if it’s just me romanticising just a simple vacation crush & being delusional or if there is something actually there. \n I feel so empty without him & it’s so silly of me because I don’t even know his name. \n What’s going on? What do I do.. I desperately need advice/another perspective on this.\n    submitted by    /u/psychiatristno828  \n [link]   [comments]",

My first few jobs were in food service and half the time was spent cleaning. I don't even want to think about what happens in the food prep areas. Why do people even frequent places like that. Back home (3rd world country) it wouldn't matter how good your food is, if you have a dirty establishment no one would stay and eat.\n Edit1: A lot of people are not reading the text. I never said anything about the preparation of the food. I meant how dirty the establishments are. In my third world country, even in family owned businesses, cleanliness is very important at least just for looks. The prep might be another story. \n And before people try to pull the western standards card, is it really a western standard to have a clean presentable place to eat?

          "description": "I travel to Vietnam in February and 14th of February I am planning to leave Hanoi and move to Central Vietnam, in Da Nang.\n Fare prices have been a lot higher than usual (95 EUR single trip) for almost a month since I am tracking them. But they mostly keep its high price, they dont fluctuate either up or down.\n Sice its almost a month before the flight, as many know, this is a period when the prices start moving and when you can usually pick a good deal.\n I would like to ask knowleable people about in this, do you think is possible that the price is high yet just because of the expectation and it can still drop down, or there more likely there is a really high demand even the 4th day after Tet (as far as I read, most of the people travel before not after Tet)?\n Do I risk that the fare will be completely sold out if I wait longer?\n I would like to hear from the people who have know how this works, please don't post your advices based only on your feelings if you are not experienced in searching cheap fares.\n ​\n EDIT: also I am wondering, about something. Do you think that if I make the reservation to the point I am selecting the seats, this is a real view of how fully is being the flight booked or not? Free seats means not sold yet or they can be sold to 3rd agencies (KAYAK, KIWI...) but yet not sold to the end party...

          "description": "We prepaid 50% for an 11:30 to 5:00 (17:00) cruise through a tour company (900K VNĐ each total not prepay). We arrived on time and received a ticket from the ship personnel which stated 290K VNĐ each. \n The boat was large and comfortable. We excitedly disembarked at the first stop at a large cave. There were maybe 1,000 people walking through the cave which meant walking up steps was 1 or 2 steps at a time. At points where pictures could be taken, there were no less than 50 large boats present in the shot. \n The other two stops to kayak and hike were very short and had boats and tourists everywhere. The smell of exhaust from the boats was bad. \n After disembarking after the day was complete, we thought the tour company made a mistake ( even though my wife is Vietnamese and fluent) since the boat ticket said 290K vnđ and we already paid 900K VNĐ. \n As we left the docks, the tour company contacts us again to pay the second 900K vnđ. When my wife asks about the 290K vnđ tickets, she is told “that does not include your food”. Our food was a mediocre lunch. \n Are we to believe that the boat trip cost 290k vnđ per person and the food cost 610k vnđ per person? Haha. Please. \n My advice is to only book directly with the cruise line. And only do that if you don’t mind paying to be elbow to elbow with tourists\n I will get many downvotes from the tour operators but I bet I get few rebuttals from them\n    submitted by    /u/Rockyt86  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are not even that old and you can't control it either. Can't increase or decrease the time where Zalo considers it to be old. -Suggestion of random people which I'm sure 90% don't give a shit about.

We're staying from 30th Jan-12th February, coincidentally during Tet Holiday. \n  \nIs there a reliable website to buy train tickets in advance?\n Do the train stop at some cities so you can go outside and explore it during a short time between stops?\n Is it worth buying train tickets ASAP since it's Tet holiday soon?\n We're thinking of either staying in Hoi An one night and continuing the next day, is this something you would recommend or is going straight to HCMC?\n  \nThank you and looking forward to visiting your country! \n Bonus question:\n  \nIs it offensive if I wear those green short sleeved shirts older Vietnamese men wear as a mediterranean looking guy?

They handed me beer, food, rice wine, etc. We kept drinking for quite some time. There was also a bit of weed which they offered me and that I smoked.\n Eventually we go a bit further away, they said to listen to some music. We arrive at some small shop but there is no music. After that I say I am going home and I don't need help going home, I can walk. One of the guys insists I go with him on the scooter. Despite the language barrier, I understand it as if he will now drive me home, so I go with him. Instead we drive for a bit with me barely getting closer to my home and we get off at the center square of the city. We talk for a bit and I say I am walking home now, they suggest I take one of the nearby taxis. It feels a bit sketchy for me so I do not take a taxi and I tell the guys I will walk home. I start walking and with an uneasy feeling. There are not many people out at this time. I order a Grab and it arrives quite quick, then I eventually get back to my hotel safely.\n I am not sure what to think of this whole meeting. It should also be mentioned that I did not see anyone paying for the bill at the restaurant, and I got the impression that I was sort of expected to pay for it, since at one time the bill was placed in front of me. I never paid though.\n What do you think? Was I at risk of something happening?\n    submitted by    /u/nicotinecravings  \n [link]   [comments]",

She was fighting, kicking and crying. Everyone just looked, it was a crowded street, the taxi drove of. I ran after it after a bit of hesitation, luckily there was oncoming traffic so I was able to catch up to the car. I opened the taxi drivers front door and told him to let the women out. He tried unlocking the door but the man locked the door always from inside and yelled at the driver to drive away. Finally I was able to open the door, the women sadly just ran away, I tried to keep the dude contained by holding the door, but he pushed the door open, punched me and then ran after the women. After I got my footing back I ran after them, but I wasn’t able to locate them by foot. I tried asking expats to follow them on the bike but no one wanted to.. so I sprinted to the police in Thao dien, who also seemed disinterested… I don’t know how to feel.\n    submitted by    /u/Soulfreezer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My dad who is now a viet kieu had brought a house years ago in Vietnam for his father and brother to live in. He had to change the ownership to his father since Vietnam doesn't allow viet kieu to own properties in the country. Unfortunately, a a few years after the dad passed away, the next person to have their name on the property is his brother and the brother promised my dad that he will give the house back to him later on when the time is right even though they didn't sign any contract because my dad naively believed in him. His brother is now dead and the ownership goes to his wife. My dad expected his sister in law to then rightfully transfer the ownership to him or even half of the house because the sister in law did help the family a lot while my dad was overseas, but she retorted back saying that my dad did not care about the family at all and had contributed nothing so he does not deserve any part of the house. We are going to sue her because we have the papers that prove that my dad did contribute a lot to that house and even my late grandpa acknowledged that in one of his old letters to my dad. The house in question is currently for rent as a business. My dad and I found a lawyer through connections and he said to stop my auntie from potentially selling it later, we must first block her from doing that by depositing 20% value of the house to the funds before the court trial since that's how the law works. Is that correct? I'm trying to find a new lawyer cause I don't trust this one and I see him as really incompetent.

I have celebrated the Lunar New Year with him/his family for the past 3 years, and there's a Tết festival we will be attending this year. I would really love to get an ao dai and wear it to the festival- I've only ever worn normal clothes. I think they're beautiful and since I plan on marrying my boyfriend I would like to embrace his culture as much as I can. I'm honestly a little shy to ask him about wearing one, he was born here and is pretty Americanized so I'm not sure if he'll think it's weird if I asked. \n    submitted by    /u/Feisty-Asparagus-974  \n [link]   [comments]",

I once bought hazelnut roasted beans (not in Vietnam) that smelled so good but was rather bland or weak in taste. Somewhat they took the coffee taste away but infused the smell.\n The coffee flavors here are sweet like those instant 3 in 1. The saigon, egg and salted coffee were the least of my favorites.

Are there any public pickup spots for basketball in Hanoi? Would love to meet up for some games next year when I’m there. \n -Sân Bóng Rổ HK Sport: Came at 6pm on a Friday. No entrance fee but zero people at the basketball court. It looked nice though, I left immediately. -Sân Bóng Rổ CLB Ba Đình: Came at 5pm on Friday. Security at the facility main gate said they are fixing the court and it’s closed. Not sure I even went to the right place though. -The New Quarter (612 Đ. Hoàng Hoa Thám, Bưởi, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam): Arrived 6:30pm on Friday. Nice one and half courts. About 25 people mostly teenagers shooting around. A group seemed to have reserved the full court for a party without playing any games. I shot around for an hour before asking to start playing 3’s. After the game ended, some guys said their friends showed up and started their own games.\n    submitted by    /u/PhoGaDacBiet  \n [link]   [comments]",

The warden threw a hissy fit and started yelling and raising hell and gave us a very rough time. Plus, there was no way to properly explain to him that it was just a friend dropping by a bit, and not an escort - since he doesn’t understand english. \n He harasses us further by locking us in and not letting our friend out for about an hour. He then threatened to report us to police and demanded money to the tune of 30 million dong (which he said was to pay the cops). He also refused to get us the manager. We are all very shaken by this experience, and are quite convinced it wasn’t lawful at all. After he realised that he wasn’t getting a penny out of us, he calmed down after a bit and opened the shutters.\n What can we do about it?\n P.S: We’re in HCMC, and booked the hostel via Hostelworld.\n    submitted by    /u/sexybeluga  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm an American living and working in Hanoi. I'm trying to become more educated on Vietnamese table manners. This topic has been frustrating to me. My Vietnamese girlfriend and my Vietnamese friends have commented on some of my bad table manners. It's been difficult for me to try and change my eating habits. \n Here are some of the things I experienced:\n  \nVietnamese share their meals. My girlfriend told me that I should share food so I don't appear selfish. Usually in the US, my friends and I would just share an appetizer and then I would just eat the dish I ordered. I also had difficulty adjusting to this because I was concerned with hygiene. \n Vietnamese aren't so finicky with hygiene. My friends share food using the same chopsticks they eat with, and when I have beer with friends they handle the ice cubes with their hands. Surprising at first, but I don't make a fuss about it.\n I shouldn't accept food using my chopsticks when someone is offering food with their chopsticks. I just did this once, and people told me I shouldn't do it. I'm not sure why it is rude though. \n I shouldn't eat fast. My girlfriend told me it looks bad. I guess I eat fast, but for me it's my normal pace. I didn't have long lunch breaks in school/work in the US, so I guess that's why.\n I have to let old people eat first. I usually don't eat with older people, but I was told about this. I had food with a friend's family, and I didn't eat until her grandparents started eating. \n  \nI read a few more online, but I don't know what's true. For example, it's unlucky to flip a whole fish when eating. I have a Chinese uncle who that told me about that, but my girlfriend never heard of it.\n I hope I can receive some feedback and tips on improving my table manners. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/MopHai  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’ve been studying Vietnamese for about a month now and I’ve acquired some sentences and words. However, I did notice that there’s two dialects/accents to Vietnamese. When I look on TikTok I always see southern Vietnamese people talking about how the northern accent is complicated and sometimes hard to understand. But at the same time, most Vietnamese songs are written in the northern dialect and most apps only teach the Northern dialect. As a person who lives in the United States, I’ve seen sources state that most Vietnamese Americans speak with the southern dialect. Obviously I would want to make learning Vietnamese as easy as possible by learning the most commonly used dialect or easiest dialect to learn and understand. So this leads me to my question, should I learn the northern or southern dialect?\n    submitted by    /u/Blamoncy  \n [link]   [comments]",

What about once I've arrived and seeing a travel agency for this? Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/rastamami  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can anyone suggest if there can be some alternatives to cruise trips for the days that we are there? I have heard about some tours in Cat ba island but not sure how to choose them yet.\n I am looking to find alternatives to the Ha Long cruise for a few reasons - \n - My gf thinks it's dangerous and she doesn't want to go on an overnight cruise because she is just visiting there for photos(?)\n - Cruise may be a bit expensive for some of us. I am finding people suggesting against cheaper tours and so may have to look at something atleast upwards of $200 USD for an overnight tour.\n ​\n I am happy to receive any counterarguments and maybe I can convince my gf if there are some suggestions to go for it. \n Would anyone be able to suggest some tours or any day activities that can get us most of Ha Long/Cat Ba for the duration we are there?\n ​\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/prat33k__  \n [link]   [comments]",

I never knew I would like visiting Vietnam that much! \n I never thought I would want to visit Vietnam again, but now I want to visit every year or every other year if possible. I really enjoyed the food and the shopping, but wasn’t a big fan of the weather (I prefer cold and foggy weather). \n Maybe it’s because I was always comparing to U.S. prices, but everything was very cheap/affordable. Where I live, it’s easily $17-20 for a bowl of pho or bun bo hue. I ordered 3 bowls of bun bo hue off grab and it was only 160k (the portion sizes are smaller but even if I ate all 3 myself, that’s only about $6.50?) \n I did a lot of searching on this reddit to see where I should get my hair cut done at. I ended up going to Hair Bar in district 1 - for females, it was 580k for shampoo+mini massage, hair cut, and styling (480k if you want a quick shampoo). I’m sure there are cheaper places, but I wanted to try and get the best if possible. I recommended my sister in law to go there as well, she also enjoyed it.\n For a full body massage, facial, and hair wash, I went to Yushi Clinic Beauty & Spa in district 3 and it was about 840k for a wonderful experience - it was about 2.5 hrs long. It could have been cheaper, but I asked for some add-ons such as the facial and a scalp treatment. \n For clothes shopping, some of the shops I enjoyed were: Uniqlo SC Studios ($30-110/item ; lots of linen & silk) Rosie ($12-30 for most items, $40-50 for coats) Libe ($12-30/item) Dear Jose ($80+ dresses) Secondee Flanh\n I visited Aufra & Len Clothing as well which had some nice styles, but the quality wasn’t as nice as say, Libe or Rosie, for the same cost. \n My favorites were SC Studios and Rosie\n    submitted by    /u/XiaoMilly  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Met a nice businessman from Singapore who told me about buying property in Vietnam as an investment. He’s very bullish on the real estate in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. Sounds like a really attractive prospect since I can’t really afford a home in California. \n Was wondering how this works. I’m assuming it’s frowned upon but also isn’t Vietnam communist? So can one truly purchase land or is it land use rights? Is there a property management industry like the US? Is contract law respected here? Can a foreigner even own land?\n As a fast growing economy I see reason to both allow and limit how foreign investment enters a country (especially after seeing how foreign money came into the states pre-pandemic).\n Disclaimer: I’m just a tourist and I don’t think I’d actually buy here. I don’t have any personal ties here so I’d be too scared to put significant money here. The businessman told me about police bribery and getting screwed over by his last partner here.\n    submitted by    /u/ricardianrhythm  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am not sure about that in western, but in Vietnam, it is totally not true. In Vietnam, compared a person to a dog, no matter your intention, is a serious insult asking for violence. The similar one in the west is \"fu*k u bit*h!\" or \"you son of a bit*h!\". So yeah, just don't do it. The only exception is that you intentionally want to insult the other and want to have a fight :)\n Edit: as mentioned by some people \"cún\" (puppy) is fine for kids and girl friends to show that they are cute and you love them. \"chó\", on the other hand, is not ok.\n    submitted by    /u/vantubka  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are heading over in a weeks time. \n My partner and I are big foodies and all the travel blogs we've seen have shown how well priced and good the food is there (especially seafood). \n What are your recommendations for any specific street food shops/markets/restaurants in Da Nang?\n My understanding is seafood will be the focus but all recommendations welcome. \n Of course, any pho and bahn mi recommendations are a must-have too.\n    submitted by    /u/foreignlemon_wow  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thing is there is no ticket required. Even though i have some small bumps of uncertainties, i still gamble over the kindness and friendliness in Vietnamese. It may be my overthinking mind.

          "description": "Hi!\n My parents immigrated a few years before I was born in the US. I have a bit of family back home whom I've only met once. But of course I understand it's very tough back home and my family struggles often with money. \n One of my cousins is graduating high school this year and I just learned today that her parents are in no place to afford college tuition. They've all resigned themselves to that reality. My older cousin (different parents) also couldn't go to college and she makes 7 million a month, and the cycle of economic struggle persists. I'm in a position to send money for my little cousin's tuition, unfortunately couldn't help my older cousin in the same way. It is a no brainer for me. However, I want understanding of what higher education in Vietnam entails. More so out of curiosity and wanting to show support in learning about her experience than anything else.\n What is the cost? My family is based in Saigon, what are the schools nearby like, I don't think she is interested in being too far from family. Is it difficult to get into universities? What opportunities does a college degree afford? Googling I found the average entry level salary for a college graduate is 20-25 million. Any other information that comes to mind that I didn't think of?\n My mother didn't finish 8th grade due to poverty and hardship. My brother and I now have master's degrees, it is her greatest pride. I'm now a teacher, nothing is more important to me than education and knowledge. Thank you so much for helping me become better informed!!!\n    submitted by    /u/hunkomeatfunkobeats  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have hired a vietnamese interpreter to speak to staff there, however they are saying it's not their responsibility to put the lost item on the plane and that it is the responsibility of the airlines. I have contacted Japan airlines, the airline I flew on and their customer service is telling me it is the responsibility of the security/lost & found staff, so now I'm in this circle of each party saying it's the other person's responsbility. Has anyone on here ever lost something at Noi Bai? Can you tell me the steps you took to retrieve your item?

          "description": "I have a theory, and I'm hoping someone here can confirm or debunk it for me.\n I spent the weekend celebrating Christmas in Tam Đảo (it was lovely, thank you, merry Christmas), and I saw something that I've only seen a couple of times over the many years that I have lived here, but I think there has to be a reason behind it.\n Two big, black, brand new SUVs drove by with the blue government plates, then a meticulously upkept early 90's Toyota corolla, then two more fancy SUVs with government plates, and the guy in the corolla was dressed very well, clearly had money.\n Now, my theory is super wealthy people in VN have their cars from the early 90's, and because they're really rich, they're perfectly taken care of. And the reason for showing off such a generic, low-end car is because they are conveying that they are rich enough and important enough that they were able to afford a car in the early 90's, when this was an extreme rarity. \n Is this a real thing, or is there some other reason for this? Because I have only seen it a few times, but it has been more than once, so there has to be some reason that wealthy/well-connected people would choose to drive a 90's corolla or equivalent level car, right?\n    submitted by    /u/phedinhinleninpark  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A Vietnamese comment on Reddit told me that I am not Vietnamese if I don't see the fact the majority of people in Vietnam removed the right-side mirror of their motorcycle (if there are 7 motorcycles in the street, there are 5 motorcycles that have been removed the right-side mirror). But I don't see that in my city (Da Nang) and other Vietnamese cities I have traveled to. The vast majority of bikes have two mirrors on both sides. The percentage of bikes with the right-side mirror removed is so low that it is unnoticeable. This percentage may be as high as the percentage of motorbikes that lost the left-side mirror or the motorbikes that lost mirrors on both sides.\n Another Reddit comment assumes that I am Vietnamese but living overseas. And so on....\n I brought it to a Vietnamese forum VOZ and asked if the experience of Reddit Vietnamese matched what happens in the place Vozer lives, they confirmed it was real. Maybe they joke to me, I don't know. But If people are joking, please stop, I don't know what is joking and what is real. What I see with my own eyes from when I was born to now (being a 25-year-old man) is not something people in Reddit and Voz described.\n I am Vietnamese but people say that I am not Vietnamese, even when I have written in Vietnamese in a local/urban/vulgar style that only Vietnamese use. They just said to me that I use Google, Google Translate, ChatGPT, or AI to pretend I am Vietnamese. It is kind of sad.\n    submitted by    /u/Straight_Random_2211  \n [link]   [comments]",

Trước gia đình mình các cụ ở nhà rảnh rỗi hay xem. Thấy nó quảng cáo bán hàng khá hấp dẫn nên vừa rồi các cụ cũng đặt mua hàng.\n Mặt hàng này là thịt trâu gác bếp (thịt trâu sấy khô). Quảng cáo là để trong tủ đá trữ được 6 tháng. Bán khá đắt (1 triệu vnd / 1kg) nên mình hi vọng chất lượng tốt. \n Không ngờ mua về để tủ đá, mới được hơn 1 tuần thì 1 gói đã mốc trắng như vậy.\n Mình gọi điện đường dây nóng phản ánh với chủ shop thì chủ shop mồm năm miệng mười, nói lấn át cả khách, đổ lỗi cho khách bảo quản.\n Mình để cả 2 gói trong tủ đá, nếu do bảo quản thì cả 2 phải bị chứ. Chưa kể trong tủ đá còn rất nhiều đồ ăn khô không bị làm sao.\n Theo mình suy đoán thì vì bán nhiều hàng nên nó làm láo, trộng hàng cũ vào bán cho khách online. Ai không cẩn thận là ăn phải hàng ôi thiu. \n Mình post lên để mọi người đề phòng với kênh youtube và hội này. Đừng để vừa mất tiền vừa mua tức vào người.\n Long story short, if you don’t know Vietnamese, stay away from SapaTV food, restaurants, and hotel.

Now the questions:\n ​\n  \nIf I dismantle my touring bike (front wheel off) and have it bagged, is it possible to transport it on a bus if I want to \"skip\" a stage (due to bad weather, injury, etc.) - e.g. Quy Nhon -> Kon Tum\n How easy is it to ride out of HCMC towards Vung Tau?\n Away from the coast, is it necessary to book hotels/guesthouses in advance, or can you just show up on the day and realistically expect a room? (my dates don't overlap with Tet). Ideally I'd like to save weight and not have to bring a tent or wild camp.\n I only finalised this trip last week, so probably won't be able to learn/speak much Tieng Viet language, and my tonal pronunciation will probably be wrong. Is this likely to be a big barrier in the rural parts of the Central Highlands?\n Do most hotels/guesthouses/hostels accept card payment?\n For trains (e.g. Hue to Ninh Binh) do tickets (particularly for travellers with bicycles) need to be reserved a day in advance?\n Are there any parts of that itinerary that you reckon should be skipped given that it's January?\n And are there any sights you would really recommend that I've not included? (I've excluded Sapa, Ha Giang and Dien Bien Phu given that presumably it's pretty cold (<10 degrees) at this time of year, and I would guess the earliest days of February in Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay can still be foggy, so I'd leave that for a summer trip, given I only have 28 days).

Speaking very broadly, the idea is something like this: A, society exists in a certain state, with certain rules and traditions and practices. B, the limitations of these rules and traditions and practices prompt a reaction against them. C, the established system and the reaction against it combine to form a new system, informed by both, which then becomes part A of a new cycle.
