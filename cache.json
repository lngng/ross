          "description": "Hello, I'm coming to Vietnam for a month traveling north to south, still in the planning phase but we plan on doing a lot of day hikes and explore outside the main tourist areas, and do some activities like kayaking.\n Usually packing for holidays are quite easy for me to decide but I've never been to East Asia, and the hot weather and possible lots of rain? Makes it hard for me to decide, plus I like to travel light. \n Warmth wise is there a chance of it getting cold anywhere in August? I'm wondering if to bring a fleece or micro fleece and a synthetic padded jacket, or if a fleece and windproof jacket might do. Also probably pack a bunch of hiking shorts and 1 pair of hiking trousers.\n Coat, I have a high end thick shell raincoat, under arm zip vents, dosent pack so small into a day bag though, great in the wind, but can imagine sweating loads if it's warm and I'm walking. I have been meaning to get a lighter rain jacket so not sure if it's worth getting one instead or if a poncho will be my best friend?\n Shoes, I've got some rugged Sandles, they seem good for the citys and and anywhere near water. Daily shoes though not sure. Hiking can it get really muddy? Hiking boots seem good but annoying to carry around when not in use. Waterproof shoes I imagine feet will get super hot. Or my usual all rounder shoe is my hiking trainer. It's meshed so keeps my feet cool but takes forever to dry usually, and won't handle heavy mud/rain well, can combine with waterproof socks. Although if it's 30+ degrees maybe they might dry quicker? Or if there's any type of fast dry hiking trainer people recommend? Any tips for an would be much appreciated.

Our flight was scheduled for 8:35am and upon arrival at 6:15, they apparently cancelled the flight and that it was at 6:25am. Which means that we were too late to check in. Our travel agent checked on her end and says it still showed the original details. \n Consequences: we miss the first flight, schedule a last minute flight with a different carrier, eventually missing the second leg of the flight because of the delays. Total cost is 260+160+90USD to get to where I need to be. \n Their reasoning: they provided ample notification so they were not liable for us checking in “late”. No refund. For the second leg, our flight was within 3 hrs of the next leg “according go policy”. They pulled up the relevant article on their website.

You can see the despair in his eyes; the exact moment when he gives up against the impossible odds against him. Locals rush to and fro, helping set up the fire hoses, rushing in to battle the flames in any way they can, mostly getting in the way.\n The second video is of the aftermath.

I'd prefer to bike/walk to most places and to stay close-ish to the beach. But, if there's a \"better\" place to stay further from the beach, I'm open to it. Priorities are proximity to (mostly) non-western restaurants, bars, coffee shops, historical sites—you get it.\n My biggest priority though is meeting people. I'd really like to meet some locals and travelers at bars, non-western restaurants, meet-ups—wherever. I have a bad habit of exploring cities by myself and am actively trying to change that. Looking to meet people and have a good time, but not necessarily party/go to clubs. I heard Oi Bar was a good place to start. Any and all recommendations are appreciated.

Now, personally, I partially agree with what he's saying in his videos and I feel great that someone living in a society like Vietnam is brave enough to put out their different views, actively pointing out social, cultural flaws of the system (sometimes exaggerated though). I may be pretentious here but I consider myself a better than average young vietnamese person in terms of education, understanding of freedom of speech and open-mindedness, it would have been nice to have some meaningful polite conversations about his videos but as of right now, Vietnam is not at that level yet.\n    submitted by    /u/Theboyscampus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently visit Vietnam every 2nd month on tourist visa.\n I don't want to marry her just to buy a property sooner so looking for ways to find a property. I want to marry her at the right time and for good reasons.\n - Searching online doesn't help as I have only been finding properties in USD\n - I will happily buy property together with her as long as it's in both of our names and not just one name only\n If anyone can provide any guidance - I have simply read that foreigners can buy property in new projects/developments but that doesn't help much as all the properties advertised in English seems to be spiked in price in USD.\n Would prefer property price of up to 1.8 billion VND and if I/we can get a home loan too, that would be absolutely perfect\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/techie_mate  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thief took great advantage of us being vulnerable as it was raining, we were trying to manage our two kids and looking for a place to eat. Find my iPhone located it near a pawn shop 3 kms away from where we were. We were so tired and frustrated from our trip + the hotel staff advised us that there is no point pursuing the phone or the police. Later, a shop owner told us to w should have gone to the police and they might have been able to help. Whatever. Now we are back in our country. It is what it is but as much as I don’t want it does affect our emotions and feelings towards Hanoi and touristy areas. This can happen in many places and in many countries but still when it happens to one personally, it’s hard to not be biased. We had overall pretty good time in Vietnam, esp in Saigon and DaNang.\n Have things like this happened to any of you?\n    submitted by    /u/HinderedJoy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now they have offered me a small apartment, which I gratefully accepted. I was brought there by a friend of the owner with the motorcycle (about 10 minutes drive). When I asked her how much I should pay for the ride, she replied that she wanted nothing. Tomorrow I will leave this apartment again.

If I take a tourist sim card with 5G is it enough to connect my laptop and work ? Mostly IT work in Google Chrome and some software. No video upload etc. 2. Which sim card to take for this 30 day plan ? 3. I see lot of buses operate in cities. Are these AC buses, operate on time ? (Or like Indian buses. No schedule). 4. For travel between cities how early I need to book train/bus ticket ? Which website can I use to book ? 5. Any concern on snatching/pickpocketing? 6. My plan is saigon - DMZ - da nang/hoi an / hue - Hanoi - ninh bin - cat ba island. Is it ok or shall I add something? Exit from Hanoi airport. Max I can spend 3 to 4 weeks. In between I have to work full days :( 7. I don't speak vietnemese at all. Will there be issue with ordering food with street food vendor?

Eventually, one guy is on the ground with his bike knocked down, getting beaten with belts. The perps take off, leaving the guy curled up in fetal position.

He carries epi pens with him.\n However, people are often confused by the translated message and we think it’s not clear. \n Using google translate from English to viet to English, “no nuts, no sesame” returns as “no seeds. Unseasoned” which isn’t helpful at all hahaha.\n Also nuts can translate to peanuts but he is allergic to all nuts and nut oils. Sesame also seems to have multiple translations.\n A translation of something like “I can’t eat nuts, nut oils, sesame, sesame oil. Does this food contain them?” would be ideal! :D \n thank you for any help!!\n Edit If you’re interested hes only eating a small bite of food then waiting 5-10 mins for a reaction to be safe. if he reacted he would make himself throw it up.

The best time would be sometime between january to march, but there is also lunar year at 10th feb and I heard there is nothing todo by that time and everything is more expensive. Is that true? Is it better to come after Lunar Year? Anyway I was also googling something about Vietnam Craft Beer and beer festivals. I found something but doesn’t give much info really. Is there something like that? Could you tell me more about craft beer in Vietnam please? Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/likjup  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’ve been dating for over six months and the relationship has gotten serious.\n I love him (surprisingly, his family also loves me) and it’s looking like things might end in marriage down the line. I’m amazed they accept me so easily when my family doesn’t accept him, but I try my best anyway. His family wants everyone to live together someday soon. My boyfriend says no.\n My boyfriend has a rebellious spirit. His cousin bought me VN government-issued textbooks to study the language, but he doesn’t want to teach me Vietnamese manners. It leads to awkward situations with his family A LOT. He says “just be yourself, it’s America!” but I want his family’s approval.\n His parents were very poor in VN and are very traditional. My family is rich and has more advanced manners than average Americans. I grew up with my grandparents too, so I act and dress more like an older lady. It’s funny because sometimes I act like a polite American to his parents and they say to my boyfriend “she has Vietnamese manners, nice”. I’m totally uneducated but I know I offend them a little sometimes. \n For example, he didn’t tell me I should offer his parents to eat before I eat their food. Things like that. \n Please, if anyone has information on how not to offend Vietnamese parents, tell me. I never dress provocatively or curse, and I try to be as helpful as possible in the kitchen. My boyfriend’s family gives me a lot of patience as a westerner, but I want to do the right thing.\n Thank you 💗\n    submitted by    /u/Impossible_Biscotti3  \n [link]   [comments]",

Have been using a dating app here. I noticed there are some girls on the app who are very eager to meet right away and go for a drink. Stupidly, I agreed to go with one this evening.\n She told me to meet her around the corner from Sniff club. Met her, looked nothing like her photos (which hardly showed her face anyway). She led us to this club.\n She didn’t even speak English and we communicated via google translate…\n She said she wanted to drink champagne 🤦🏼‍♂️ so I bought a bottle. Then she asked if she can do some balloons, and kept asking for more and more. At one point she suggested I tip the bar staff. \n She was super flirty and touching me all over. Until I said no to more balloons she acted like a grumpy child.\n I noticed some girls who were waiting on the corner, who later on were in the same club with some foreigner men.\n I am quite sure these girls are employed by the club to get men to come in and spend money. My total bill was 5 million…\n It’s a sad feeling to be taken advantage of like this.

They said the dentists in Vietnam are incompetent and that if she were to have issues with the dentures, she will have to get them redo in the States which will cost even more money. \n I understand both sides of the argument.

          "description": "In a particular marketing team, there is a supervisor who holds the same number of years of work experience as the other team members but demonstrates less competence. It is evident to everyone in the office that the supervisor is the CEO's favorite employee. Whenever the CEO makes an insensitive joke, if the supervisor reacts poorly, the CEO apologizes. However, if anyone else in the team reacts negatively, the CEO calls them out, expressing dissatisfaction with their response.\n Interestingly, it was the supervisor who recently fired a colleague, but the CEO publicly supported the decision, attributing it to himself. This situation suggests that the CEO is protecting the supervisor by taking responsibility for the dismissal. This lack of transparency creates an unbalanced power dynamic within the office. After the incident, the office became dull.\n Moreover, the supervisor constantly seeks to know what others are doing, including questioning their work methods. This behavior can be bothersome, especially when team members are competent and experienced. For instance, one team member was surprised when the supervisor asked for assistance with a basic marketing task, such as scheduling social media posts. It is disconcerting when someone in an executive role lacks knowledge of fundamental marketing tools.\n These observations raise my concerns about power dynamics within the team. The supervisor appears to be favored, even with her limited competence, while others are held to a different standard. Additionally, the CEO's protection of the supervisor and the supervisor's micromanagement tendencies suggest an abuse of power. \n    submitted by    /u/DelusionalBroccoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was recently travelling in Southeast Asia and I was shocked by the behaviour of people (especially Vietnamese) regarding trash and plastic. I saw so many people (young and old) simply throwing their trash onto the street: people eating chips and dropping the bag in the sidewalk, a man putting deodorant and tossing it to the middle of the road, plastic bottles, bags, cans of drinks… basically litter everywhere. \n This is particularly disturbing in big cities like Hanoi and Saigon, which are apparently developed and everyone has a phone and internet, but no one seems to have environmental awareness about reducing and recycling their waste.\n I can understand that old habits die hard and older people continue doing that, but the younger ones seem to follow that path as well. \n Also, the amount of plastic is insane. Is there really a need to get a drink in a plastic cup, inside a plastic bag, sealed with a plastic lid and drink it from a plastic straw? Even if you drink it on the spot and not take away, they will still put the plastic lid with a machine. On top of that, after finishing the drink, all that plastic ends up being dumped on the street.\n I’m no environmental “freak” or entitled European, but I’m genuinely curious if this is an issue being addressed by Vietnamese people (in schools, public campaigns) or if they simply don’t care. Has there been any improvement in recent years? Do you think there will be?\n    submitted by    /u/DefinitionFlaky3448  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Xin chào! What are nice spots/mountains for hiking in Vietnam? When I was there a few months ago, I was kinda disappointed. Not by the landscape and nature but rather by the accessibility and availability of tracks. I went hiking near Da Lat and Phan Thiet, which was great, but although the north is a lot more mountainous, they were barely accessible due to dense forests and lack of paths. Sometimes there was \"too easy\" access, which attracts tourists (e.g., viewpoint in Ninh Binh). Ofc Fansipan is an option but I'd rather do the tour by myself without a guide, also I heard it's quite touristic.

However, I've been thinking about opening up my own business as I have extensive experience in my field and I feel quite confident I can make it work well.\n My question is what is the least hassle-free way of doing this. I have zero problem putting the business 100% into my wife's name if it means less issues.\n Would this be the recommended course of action? If so, is anyone aware of the fees or capital requirements for a 100% Vietnamese owner versus a foreigner owner? Anything else that might be worth taking into consideration?\n I'm not trying to shortcut any taxes or anything like that. I have no problem paying my fair share.

Đứa bé nghiêm túc hỏi: “Con chào dì, dì cho con hỏi nhà dì có nến không ạ?”. Bà ta thầm nghĩ: “Cái gia đình này nghèo đến nỗi ngay cả nến cũng không có sao? Tốt nhất không cho, cứ như thế họ sẽ ỷ lại mất”.\n Nghĩ rồi, bà liền nói to một tiếng: “Không có!”. Đúng lúc bà ta đang chuẩn bị đóng cửa, đứa bé đó liền cười rạng rỡ và nói: “Con thừa biết là nhà dì không có nến mà!”. Nói xong, đứa bé liền lấy ra hai cây nến: “Mẹ và con sợ dì sống một mình không có nến nên con đem sang tặng dì hai cái để thắp sáng ạ!”. Lúc này, bà ta vừa tự trách bản thân, vừa cảm động rơi nước mắt, sau đó liền ôm chặt đứa bé vào lòng.\n    submitted by    /u/OtissNguyen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Out of curiosity, from those who have experienced any of these how effective does everyone think these following traditions are?: - Wind snatching (Dật gió) - Wind scraping (Cạo gió) - Cupping (Giác hơi) - Acupressure (Bấm Huyệt) - Bloodletting (Cắt llể)\n Do they actually help with what they intend to do (e.g reduce pain/stiffness, cure diseases, improve skin or health etc.) or are they mainly placebo from your experience?\n Context if you’re curious: I’ve lived in Australia my whole life and an currently in Vietnam to visit family after a long time. My family is very insistent on using traditional medicine techniques to improve my skin. They took me to a doctor who put small cuts on my skin all over my body, and when I searched this up I got the term ‘Cắt llể’ for bloodletting. They’ve been doing this almost more than weekly and they say that it’s getting all the bad blood out. In my opinion it’s a real pain and honestly I doubt it’s doing anything. But maybe it works for others?\n I’ve been provided wind scraping before with my family using the green eagle medicine and they said that the redder it is the more sick I am. It’s probably very red because of how hard they scrape it into my skin! It definitely helps warm you up though.\n I’m just wondering how this all is for both people who have lived in vietnam and how normal it all is.

Obviously food and coffee culture there is amazing but what else?\n I also hate busy hustle and bustle cities. I currently live in one and want to get away from it.\n My plan is to go surfing and exploring in vung tau for 5-6 days. And then go to a relaxing resort/beach in phu quoc for 5 days.\n That still leaves about 7 days in Saigon... I wonder if I should just spend more time in vung tau and phu quoc instead of Saigon since I don't like city/night life.\n What you guys think?\n    submitted by    /u/IntroductionSex101  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mình nhận ra là mình đã bõ lỡ rất nhiều thứ ở Việt Nam từ khi mình đi du học. Từ lúc đó mình có suy nghĩ là mình muốn về Việt Nam làm việc và sinh sống. 1 phần cũng là vì để ở gần ba mẹ và ông mình, 1 phần là muốn tiềm hiểu thêm về ngành Supply Chain ở Việt Nam và mở rộng network và 1 phần nữa là tận hưởng những năm tháng thanh xuân mà mình đã bõ lỡ. Mình có apply vu vơ thì được 1 cty đa quốc gia nhận. Lương ~ $4000 usd/ tháng. Tầm tầm với bên này mình đang làm. Mình suy nghĩ nhiều lắm không biết có nên về hay không.

Often when I want to speak to the Viet people of Houston they often prefer to speak in English, yes I know that my Vietnamese is not perfect nor is my understanding and that dialect may be a barrier. At times I will ask they try to speak VNese with me even though I may struggle to understand. How do I make it known that I prefer to speak Vietnamese to improve my own understanding? \n In houston we have many people speaking southern dialects and I have learned a northern dialect. I believe it is best to know and understand multiple dialects. I noticed that people will understand roughly what I am trying to say but out of politeness will not speak Vietnamese with me because they can tell from my speaking that maybe my understanding is not the best this happens most especially with viet kieu. \n What are suggestions that you all would have to help me engage in normal conversation?\n    submitted by    /u/Creepy-Jump8129  \n [link]   [comments]",

Has anyone had this experience before? (A non-us citizen authenticating a US document). What should i do? I don't want to fly to Vietnam before authenticating my TEFL, i know it would be much harder this way.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/gabletru20  \n [link]   [comments]",

We may or may not be rich in our country but the money exchange from our country to Vietnam makes us look rich.\n I rented an apartment with my family and they told me all the Viet Kieu lives in this apartment. My family told me girls will want us for citizenship. My mom told me not to tell people that I am in a Viet Kieu in public because I will get robbed.\n A lot of people try to talk to me in English.

Any time he needs to communicate something to me he uses Google translate, and he does know a few phrases like \"thank you\" and \"good night,\" but today he brings his phone up to me and shows me his question, which is that he would like help learning English. \n He asked for my phone number and I didn't want to be rude, so I gave it to him, but he texted me saying he needs someone to help him learn English. \n I'm not really a teacher, and I definitely don't speak Vietnamese. I want to provide some sort of help, because he's always so nice and patient when I'm helping with whatever he needs around the gym, but I'm at a loss for what to say. \n I was hoping maybe reddit would be a good place to find people who understand Vietnamese culture, and might know what sort of help he is looking for specifically?\n (I have texted him asking if he is Vietnamese just to be sure.

          "description": "Hi everyone! My name is Victor, from Saigon Dragon Studios. For a bit more than 2 years now we’ve worked on the RTS game Space Tales, and today we’re making its Steam page public :)\n https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457960/Space_Tales/?beta=0\n Quick background about us: we’ve launched SDS in 2015, as an outsourcing studio specializing in video game 2D and 3D arts. Vietnam (and HCMC) are well known in the video game industry as several top outsourcing companies are located there. A ton of Vietnamese talents have worked on famous games/movies. Surprisingly however, there aren’t many studios in Vietnam who develop and publish their own games (– whenever I am in a game convention for example I always hear ‘ah yes Vietnam, it’s where Flappy Bird was made”, which really annoys me because it’s not representative of the talents Vietnam has.)\n A couple of years ago we decided to start working on our own game in parallel of our outsourcing services, and we wanted to do as much as possible in Vietnam (only music and sounds are being made elsewhere). We still have a lot of work to do on our game, but we would love to hear your feedback on what we have to show for now.\n The teaser for our game can also be watched on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elHEmpUTcEk \n Looking forward to receiving your feedback.\n    submitted by    /u/SDS_SpaceTales  \n [link]   [comments]",

My mom basically forced me to come with her this past June, and I was dreading it bc the time difference, the heat, and the fact that it’s more of a developing country and I’m so spoiled in the Us. Well that was so naive of me because I definitely had an unforgettable experience and vietnam blew me away. \n We backpacked a bit through vietnam, we went to Saigon, Canh Tho, Cu Chi, Sapa, Hanoi, halong bay, phu quoc, Mekong, tay ninh. At first when I landed I couldn’t wait to get back home. But throughout the trip , the sights were in believable, the food amazing, the motorbikes were so fun, and just cruising through the streets people watching of the cities was so enjoyable. There was just so much to see culture wise as well and opened my eyes to a different lens of the world. and now that I’m back home I feel a small heartache which I wasn’t expecting. It’s been 2 days and I’m still thinking abt this trip\n Although some people were rude and inconsiderate, most were so kind, they treated me and my sister like celebrities. (I thought we looked viet but guess not lol) ppl were constantly approaching us saying we were beautiful. Also i noticed that everyone talks to each other like they already know each other, which is so different than in america. I loved vietnam and want to go back again. This trip holds a special place in my heart and I think will trigger me to start travelling internationally more because that was transformative\n    submitted by    /u/jnn-11000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I'm planning a trip in December. I spent six weeks in Central Vietnam about 10 years ago and I loved it! Unfortunately I've been struggling with health problems for the last couple of years, and so this trip is very much going to be a relax by the pool type of affair.\n I was considering Hoi An or potentially Sapa for a 10 day stay? The touristy nature of Hoi An is a bit confronting whereas the Northern mountain ranges are attractive as hell to me. Can anyone lend their opinion/give any recommendations for a resort-style stay that isn't going to be busy to the point of stressful?\n Proposed Itinerary\n December 1st - 4th Fly into Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay for a few nights to recover from flight\n December 4th - 14th Bus/train/plane to destination and stay for 10 days\n December 14th - 17th Bus/train/plane back to Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay a few days before departure\n Additional Info\n  \nI should be able to manage around 5,000 steps each day\n Budget is around $4,000 AUD for two people for 17 days (not including flights)\n I'm used to travelling for the adventure so this style of travel will be very new to me. Anything luxurious + off the beaten path is very appealing!\n  \nWould appreciate any help! Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Gerald_of_River  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "​\n Tôi là nam 18 tuổi và đã đến Catfe trong chuyến đi đến Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh ở Việt Nam (ngày 19 tháng 6). Khi tôi ở đó, tôi đã thử vuốt ve một con mèo mới được giới thiệu với Catfe. Trước khi có thể vuốt ve con mèo, một cô gái tình cờ cảnh báo tôi rằng con mèo mới đến và nó cắn. Dù sao tôi cũng quyết định vuốt ve nó và cuối cùng bị trầy xước, nhưng điều mà tôi vẫn nghĩ sau đó là giọng nói của cô gái đó nghe thật hấp dẫn làm sao. Tôi không nghĩ đến việc bắt chuyện vì tôi muốn nhìn thấy nhiều mèo hơn, nhưng càng nghĩ về tình huống đó, tôi càng nghĩ về cách tôi nên tiếp cận cô gái mặc quần yếm màu hồng đó. Cô ấy không chỉ có giọng hát hay mà còn rất xinh đẹp và thậm chí trang phục của cô ấy cũng rất tuyệt. Nếu điều này đến được với cô ấy, tôi sẽ coi đó là một phép màu. \n ​\n I am an 18 year old male and went to a Catfe during my trip to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam (June 19). While I was there I tried petting a new cat that was introduced to the Catfe. Before being able to pet the cat, a girl just so happened to warn me that cat was new and that it bites. I decided to pet it anyway and ended up getting scratched, but what I kept thinking about afterwards was how attractive that girls voice sounded. I didn't think about starting a conversation because I wanted to see more cats, but the more I think about that situation, the more I think about how I should have approached that girl in pink overalls. Not only was her voice pretty, but she was beautiful too and even her outfit was awesome. If this ever reaches her I would consider it a miracle. \n ​\n Catfe address: CATFE, 119 Đ.

          "description": "I never got a driver license in my home country so when I got married my wife(who is Vietnamese) decided it would be best to get a drivers license in Vietnam. The theory test which is all in Vietnamese of course involved me studying and memorizing answers for 6 months. As a result I was able to easily pass it along with the theory test. Despite being an inexperienced driver I thought that tge practical test would be a piece of cake. But I've just failed my 4th test in 4 months. I feel hopeless and useless. My wife passed it after the first try and really can't understand why I can't pass it. To make things worse my Vietnamese in laws and all their friends and relatives are making feel awful about not passing the test.\n I am starting to feel hopeless and depressed and I feel really pressured by everyone around me to pass. I do a practice run the day before I take the test everytime and I am usually able to pass with 100 points but when it comes to the test I always end up messing something up. Today I even failed within the first two minutes. The other times I was actually pretty close to passing but messed up. I have gone around the course on my own many times and have no issue passing. I don't know whats wrong with me.\n    submitted by    /u/BornChef3439  \n [link]   [comments]",

Start at the top/bottom and make my way to the other side while trying pho (and other food of course) in different cities.\n So I have a few questions, especially for people who have more experience with Vietnam and trying food in different areas of the country!\n  \nDo you think this is a fine idea, or a waste of time? Is pho really that different depending on what part of Vietnam you are in, or is it mostly the same?\n Which areas (or specific restaurants) would you recommend I try for a complete experience?\n Are there any other regional foods that you recommend I try on this journey?\n  \nI will be trying to document as much of this as possible, so I will definitely come back with my thoughts and feedback on how different they actually were, my favorites, etc!\n    submitted by    /u/Dizzy-Possession3586  \n [link]   [comments]",

Last week I received news that he had fallen incredibly ill so I booked a last minute trip to Vietnam to visit him for about 3 weeks. Although this isn't exactly a vacation as I plan on helping to care for my dad, I'm sure there will still be plenty of opportunities to go exploring and get back in touch with my Vietnamese heritage.\n Given that I haven't gone by since I was 6 and that I'm from California, I really have no idea how to prepare. What should I bring? What should I be cautious about? What are some dos and don'ts? I'm a pretty open-minded eater and literally wish to try all the things. Any recommendations?\n Other things about me:\n My Vietnamese is decent, I understand the southern accent very well and can get by in terms of speaking, but things get a little rough if the other person has a northern accent. If the other person has a central accent, no way lol. Unfortunately I can't read Vietnamese either.\n I'm terrible at dealing with the heat but can manage if I have to.\n I'm not taking days off work and plan to work (I'm a software engineer director) as well. How's the coffee shop scene over in Nha Trang?\n Any recommendations on what I must do over there on this last minute unplanned trip would also be appreciated!\n Edit: Spelling\n    submitted by    /u/solidiquis1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I have been in Vietnam for a month now, and want to learn the language better as I want to have better interactions with locals and respect their land. I want to show the people here that I’m not a foreigner who only speaks English.\n Here’s the thing - I’m doing job interviews at the moment trying to get a job, but have limited money at the moment. I did a trial lesson at a centre, and after the lesson they asked if I wanted to pay for my tuition fees then and there. The fees were 19.6 for 80 hours (I believe?) but I told them I don’t have the money for it currently due to finding work and not employed. I really want to start learning as soon as possible, but really struggle with apps such as Duolingo and resources like YouTube. I can’t learn anything from there - I get super distracted because of my ADHD and prefer in-class.\n Do you have any suggestions, or should I just wait until I start getting a salary and have more money? It’s making me a little sad that I only speak English and want to learn the language because I feel like I’m experience 1/50th of the life here…\n    submitted by    /u/sabethrowaway  \n [link]   [comments]",

She went to Vietnam in the beginning of May to visit her family after graduating and starting her job in August. She figured while she was there she would renew her passport (Expired in June of 2023). Unknown to us that there’s a shortage issue with the newer ID there and she can only renew her passport using that newer ID. It’s been a month and a half, there’s no sign of her getting the ID. Is there something she can do so that she can return back to the U.S. more urgently? Or rather what’s the average wait time for the ID to get processed, printed, and shipped? For future planning. \n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Web_Impressive  \n [link]   [comments]",

From step 2 shipment details, it doesnt proceed to step 3 select payment. So I might just check and buy it in the actual Samsung Store. Is it true that you cannot buy in the Bitexco branch? The other nearest to my hotel is the 134 Nguyen Thai Hoc St. branch. Anyway, can anyone check the latest price of Samsung S23+ in HCM? I just wanted to check if it's the same as the one in store. Also, if this is the wrong sub to post this inquiry, please help me identify the correct one.\n Since I'm already here, any tips on my upcoming trip? Previously went to Hanoi already.

This obsession has been going on for years now.\n I'm aware of all the pros and cons, it's just that I have this strange yearning to be there. My mom passed away last year and her family is still in Vietnam. We are very close and I want to live near her family before they all pass away as well. They are one connection I have left with her.\n The main issue is that I won't be able to get more than 3-4 weeks vacation off each year from work, and tickets will cost around 8k now. The flight is so long too just for a trip where we'll be spending at least one week with jetlag and stomach issues. Plus, my wife wants to go on vacations/beaches while I just want to near Quan 7 with the relatives.\n I've thought about moving to Orange County or Houston to ease this feeling, but those Vietnamese cities just don't feel the same. \n I know the future is far brighter in 15 years for the family if I stay in the U.S., I just feel sad each day working. I spend hours thinking about having enough money to live in Vietnam without worrying about the future.\n It's not rose-tinted glasses either, I worked remotely and had lived in Vietnam for 6 months recently with my wife/child. It was great. I know education and healthcare might be a problem later on. Waking up early for coffee and breakfast while watching the crazy traffic, going out to eat seafood/hot pot at night - that just can't be beaten.\n I suppose I'm just ranting and being too greedy. I can always get a significant pay cut/career limitation and get a remote job to live in Vietnam. It's just that I want what's best for my family/kid's future as well.\n Does anyone(especially the Viet Kieus) feel the same way?\n    submitted by    /u/baoluvboa  \n [link]   [comments]",

They transferred her to a police station in Vietnam and the police officer used Viber to video talk with my wife in full uniform. She declined when he started asking for passport information.

Everything from the food to the people are top notch. I don't know whether it's because I come from a country where women who drink and smoke and walk the streets late at night are perennially unsafe, but being here is simply so liberating. I haven't travelled the world much, but I've been to the Middle East, Singapore, and Germany, and none of them compare. Being here is a cultural shock in a good way.\n I know this post is vague, but I just wanted to say thank you so much wherever I could and to whomever I could, hence me doing so here.

          "description": "I live in Vietnam. I went back home and when I came back to Vietnam I brought some souvenirs and gifts. Nothing special. I was brought up \"minimalist\". I never bought fancy gifts for my partners, friends, and family. So, why would I do that to people who are, well, at the periphery of my friendzone?\n And all in all: Isn't it the thought that counts?\n Anyhow, my gifts received some harsh comments. For instance, a Vietnamese friend got some brand clothes from Europe. I bought some toys for his younger brother. Do you know Playmobil? A bit like Lego. I confess, the two toys (a Wild-west Fort and a Pirate ship) were on discount. But they cost about 100$. That is more than I gave to my bf for Christmas, LOL. Anyhow, I can survive that a 10yo doesn't say thankyou and is happy. But my friend said, that his brother was disappointed because he wanted some more \"valuable\".\n I am not on a paylevel which enables me to throw around with MacBooks and Iphones. I do not have such devices neither.\n Another time I was invited and I bought a 25$ red wine bottle. In my home country Germany that would already be too much. Most guests will spend about 10-15$. No one really awaits a 1,000$-bottle of Rothschild stuff.\n Anyhow, the host was quite rude. During the evening he showed my bottle, made a gesture like vomitting and put it aside. Then he presented a fancy Whiskey bottle and told everyone that the bottle was about 200$. This person was not even close to me, so why would I pay 200$ for some alcohol? I am in general a generous guy, but these two examples (there are quite more in my experience) are really too much. I understand, I am the \"rich\" foreigner. But they cannot really await that I come of dozens of Iphones, cars, laptops? I feel really sad, since my personal life is not circling around consumption.\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_Kha  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! A friend and I are going to be in Hanoi for 10 days in July, and we were planning on spending 5 days in Hanoi, a day trip to Ninh Binh and the last 3 nights in Ha Long Bay, but we've been seeing threads on how Ha Long is deserted and there's no point in staying the night there.\n Can someone please provide some clarity on whether this is true and too much time in Ha Long? Taking an overnight cruise is a little outside our budget so we're not keen on that, especially given that one of us is prone to seasickness. Would it be better to spend a couple of days elsewhere in the north? If yes, where should we be going?\n    submitted by    /u/Junior_Assistance171  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nguyên nhân khiến mình áp lực và thất vọng có lẽ là vì mình đã làm \"vua chột trong xứ mù quá lâu\" và được bạn bè, thầy cô, cha mẹ cho là giỏi suốt những năm đi học mãi tới sau này mình mới nhận ra điều này, Mình mới dùng reddit vì cũng chả biết chia sẻ với ai nữa.

Told me he has family in Australia and telling me all about them. Asked if I'd like to get a drink with him, which I was happy to do!\n Spent some time drinking with him, during which time he told me his family were visiting and they were having a big party. When it was time to go, he asked if I'd buy a bottle of wine for their party, which I agreed to do. He took me about a 10min ride away to a shop to buy wine, which cost 900,000 dong and then took me back to where we met. I realised at the time the wine was very expensive but I was a little drunk and didn't know where I was exactly so I didn't protest. I assume he just takes the wine back and splits the profits with the shop! \n While we were drinking he took my email, I assume he'll try and have me send money for something else, but should I watch out for anything else? \n Thanks for any advice!\n    submitted by    /u/bonjarden  \n [link]   [comments]",
