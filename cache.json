          "description": "From the west we obviously have a reputation for drinking too much hard liquor and far too frequently. \n But I enjoy a beer about as often as Vietnamese do. \n That is, on special occasions or social gatherings. \n My problem is how much beer. I like 1-2 decent quality beers and some good relaxed conversation.\n But I find over here my cup just keeps getting refilled. 4,5,6,7 beers later and the case is empty. It's just too much for my stomach or bladder to handle to be honest. I didn't even drink like that when I was a delinquent teenager. \n People start getting obnoxious and getting me to say rude and inappropriate things in Vietnamese (which I don't speak very well). And they try to make me say it over and over and over again because they're totally wasted. \n I miss that culture of the west where you can take part in the drinking circle and everyone just drinks as much as they feel like. No pressure to gulp down 5L each. \n I honestly like the taste of Tiger. It's a pretty good beer for a mass-produced brew. \n But I've had to completely give up social drinking while I'm here. My body just can't handle that much anymore. I'm only 27 but I take antidepressants. \n I don't like to drink alone and my wife doesn't like beer. \n So that's my story. This Canadian is done drinking beer. I like the taste, hate the drunk. \n Not meant to be derogatory at all. This is just me expressing myself. I understand every culture is different and I've taken part in the drinking circle once with every new group I meet just to build that trust with them. But from then on I just refuse. It never just stops at 1-2 beers. \n Also, ice in warm beer? Cold out of the fridge man. Cold out of the fridge. Completely ruins the taste for me.\n    submitted by    /u/FoxResponsible4790  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I speak English originally but I would like to learn this language and visit Vietnam one day. Duolingo and the books I got are helping me understand grammar and how to read the language bit by bit, but I SUCK at speaking it, and I know I do. And I don't know any native speakers personally anymore to help correct my pronunciation. I think I end up overthinking and trying to implement the tones but in doing this I just mess the whole word up lol.\n I've tried saying phrases and words really slow then gradually increasing speed til at a normal speaking cadence and this helps a bit but I was wondering if there was something more efficient. Also I feel like due to my natural voice being kind of deep/bassy and the sort of hard way I tend to pronounce things the naturally softer or more nuanced sounds are kind of harsher than the audio samples I'm hearing. I'm just really having a hard time with this because my voice is deep and somewhat monotone unless I'm excited about something so it's hard to do the tones and when I do I feel like I'm over emphasizing them.\n It's bad enough I tend to even stutter a bit more than usual in English too but I completely butcher this beautiful language almost every time it comes out of my mouth. And I wanna be able to speak to native speakers but not laughably 💀 I know most people are gracious and kind enough to just appreciate you even took the time but still why do it if not correctly?\n    submitted by    /u/Fuckredditlowkey  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am dealing with some injurys but have had great success with Active Release Technique (or ART). I was wondering if anyone can reccomend a massage type/parlor that does something similar to this. I know that I probably won't be able to find an ART practicioner while in Hanoi so was wondering what the next best thing may be. For context ART basically involves hitting certain pressure points in soft tissue and manipulating the muscles around them through releases (i know just sounds a regular massage but it's been much more effective than say Thai massages I've had in the past). If anyone has any ideas I'd really appreciate it, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Civil_Nefariousness4  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a little worried about there not being much to do or being able to meet other English speakers and making friends. I am curious if anyone here has any insight. What is life like in Thu Dau Mot? Is there much to do for a foreigner? The only other post asking about TDM is a few years old and I was told the area has seen a lot of growth. Has anything changed?\n About me: I am a male, in my 30's, from the USA, and single. I speak no Vietnamese, although I enjoy learning languages and will attempt to learn basics while living in Vietnam. I don't drink or care too much about having access to crazy nightlife, although I like the option of being able to go out occasionally with people. I enjoy nature, riding my motorcycle around, and doing outdoorsy stuff.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Icy-Job-8460  \n [link]   [comments]",

I noticed pretty early on when she eats she tends to make quite a bit of noise and chews with her mouth open. This is something that kind of drives me insane but I’ve gotten used to it. When I met her parents I noticed her Dad made some interesting noises as well. I did gently tell her once for her own awareness that many Americans consider these things rude or slightly gross, but mostly because I didn’t want her to feel embarrassed if she didn’t know. With things like noodles or soup I can understand to a degree but sometimes it’s almost distracting.

Not even 7m from him other locals fishing. \n And I just can’t help but wonder, does he not know that pollution kills potential income and food for his neighbors? Is it education that’s needed?\n Or is it something else?\n And I’m not judging here, I’m honestly curious about why littering is so common in some SE Asian countries.

I wanted to see how dating is like in Vietnam, specifically Hanoi, before officially returning so I got on Bumble and let’s just say I am scarred for life.\n Every guys I have talked to kind of expressed that I was not good-looking to them. I am 5’2 (163 cm), which is said to be average height but most guys told me I would have a difficult time finding a partner in Vietnam bc that’s too tall. One guy said I looked like a random Tiktok man and another said I looked prudish when his goute was “modern women.” I asked what do modern women look like and he said “someone who is stylish and knows how to take care of herself.” He further said since I went to a Western university, I should have adopted their way of dressing up: more revealing clothes and heavy makeup. I told him that here in the US, it is not that common to see students dressing up and have a full-faced makeup every day. Then he kept asking for bikini and croptop pics. Though I don’t wear bikini, I like crop tops so I can send him some, but I declined bc I think it’s rude to ask for these photos because he wants “to have some motivation to tán me”.\n At first, I just want to find someone I can talk to but these interactions really crushed my confidence and made me hyper-aware of my looks. I wouldn’t say I’m ugly and I have never heard that from anyone else. In fact, a lot of people (both Vietnamese and American) called me cute or pretty. My clothes are not out of style at all. I just don’t like too revealing clothes and don’t like wasting time on heavy makeup. I guess the best word you can describe my style is classic Parisian (and occasionally basic hoodies + jeans). I am starting to doubt whether moving back home is a good idea as it feels like I would not fit in at all. \n Maybe, I guess I just forgot how much Vietnamese cared about vanity.\n    submitted by    /u/No_Understanding9095  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am Pranjal(Male from India). I am highly interested in urban history-seeing how urban spaces originate and grow. Hanoi was of particular interest to me as it possibly is the continuously inhabited oldest city in SEA(from time of Dongson Culture- Co Loa). \n I have spent the past month charting out the history in Hanoi from Co Loa, Northern Domination, Thang Long, French Colonization, Socialist era and post Doi Moi era(till around 2018) going into as much detail as possible. I just landed in Hanoi yesterday and plan to be here for a week. As part of my (amateurish) research, wanted a perspective from a Hanoi local as well who has an interest/knowledge regarding Hanoi's history(especially regarding the architectural history). In return for the help, more than happy to share my knowledge regarding history, bear any transportation/food costs, even cook some Indian food for you :) etc \n Also if in case you have reference of some paid historical service/tour group which can give me an holistic overview of Hanoi from Co Loa to present( I couldn't find any), that will be great as well. \n Thanks in advance for the help :) \n The sources that I have used so far-\n 1. Hanoi: Biography of a City - William Stewart Logan\n 2. Vietnamese Architecture - Le Phuoc\n 3. Van Horen, B. (2005). City profile Hanoi. Cities, 22(2), 161–173.\n 4. The new Hanoi: Opportunities and challenges for future urban development- Divya Leducqa, Helga-Jane Scarwellb\n 5. The origins of Ancient Vietnam- Nam C. Kim\n    submitted by    /u/pranjal_dua_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have lived in Sweden since I was a child and sometimes return to Vietnam after getting married. About 2 years ago, also in April, I was stuck in Vietnam due to the outbreak of COVID. I was surprised to see that the media in Vietnam often publishes positive news about the local epidemic situation but spread the opposite news about other countries, especially the West and the US. I remember they said that American people have no food and students have to eat leftovers. When I asked my wife (100% Vietnamese and her family lives there), she said it's normal with TV stations there. Then, when the nightmares of the epidemic passed and we returned to Sweden, we kept receiving calls from her family in Vietnam, asking if we were okay and hungry because television often broadcast news about the bad situation. like Europe is about to enter the stone age —a food crisis, a gas crisis, that sort of thing. And most recently, when we planned to join a tour, which included a visit to the West Coast of the US, there were calls from her family again, like, be careful of the shootings!\n But yesterday, when my wife showed me this statistic, I just...

That exams today are very important but i blanked the answer papers in history and geography, but i did finish the literature paper. I know i am rlly a bad student, i once didnt have so many friends in primary and middle school, they once isolated me so i used to try to cut off online connection with them to study more concentrate, in grade 8 my schl used to end at 11:45 am and then i just went home nap til 2 pm and then woke up and start to do hws til 5 pm, then just another break and start w hws again at 7pm and stayed up very late until 3 or 4 am. But my marks didnt get better, it was still low like 4 or 5, and then my classmate at middle school started to bully me like “why you so dumb but u still going to school” “why dont you stay home and do an deadend job(minimum wage job) in the future” “you are humiliating ur parents”, even the teachers humiliated me. It didnt change since i moved to highschool, i cannot change but i ask my parents to move to college or just study for some job thats ez but they want me to study uni.

          "description": "Hi, I'm asking this with utmost respect and hope I'm not offending anyone! I'm writing a play including a male Vietnamese character, and I don't want to pull a JK Rowling, so I wanted to ask actual Vietnamese people if that name makes sense and could be used.\n Yen Hao is supposed to be the first and middle name, Dong the surname. I know that with Vietnamese names, the surname usually comes first. But my play takes place in Czech Republic, and from what I've seen, Vietnamese people around here usually use the Czech order of names (so given name(s) first, surname second).\n If the name is incorrect, I'd be very glad to hear alternatives! He's based on the character of Yevgeni Dorn from Chekov's Seagull, so I'm looking for a name that sounds vaguely similar, although it's in a different language.

Since getting here, my phone has gone from working essentially the same as back home (The US) to dying more quickly than charging when plugged in (it only actually charges with the phone turned off), and dying very quickly when not off the charger. When put into airplane mode and with no wifi connected it seems to deplete more slowly. \n These are my guesses as to what is going on:\n a) the combination of charger box and charger cord I have are weak, I should try and find a stronger cord\n b) I am using Verizon's international plan and don't have a SIM card yet, so having my cell service and mobile data turned on is killing my phone. \n I will go out and buy a stronger charger today and likely be getting my SIM installed either today or tomorrow. \n Are there any other problems that could be happening based on anyone's experience that I could be missing?

From my understanding, it is the western equivalent to catching a cold. Maybe for older folk who have health conditions should be worried, but people are outside in wind all the time, yet it's spoken about like a death knell waiting to happen to you. NEVERMIND the fact that taking walks outside in the sun, getting breath of fresh air is literally the best thing for you. I've heard an additional explanation from a Vietnamese is that a sudden gust of wind could cause a stroke, temperature imbalance, or just shock in some way. Possible? Sure. B…",

Probably one of the most foreign subgroup of VN people and if you ever meet one you know we are weird af, hopefully always in a good way tho. People say I dont even look Viet (In Vietnam) , but I know I'm at least 4 Nguyens generations deep and Ive been visiting my great great grandfathers tombs out there in the jungle, so I should qualify!\n But as far as Vietnamese people and culture go we are useless! We understand Vietnamese in a weird way like only spoken Vietnamese and it should be in a specific context like when you are angry af, it's very selective. And it helps if you sound like my parents, if you have different dialect then sorry không hiểu gì hết!\n I have decided to change that and start hiểu that part of me, Ive been visiting Vietnam (mainly HCM), for a few weeks at the time, for a couple of years now. And guess what my language improved a little bit! This last year Ive visited more than 12 weeks, and the idea of relocating doesn't seem too crazy to me anymore, and actually at this stage of my life kinda makes sense, its a great challenge for me personally, and I honestly feel a little bit bored and in some ways limited here in Sweden.\n So whats my problem, just move!? Well If could just move I would but I need to find qualified work first. Im a software engineer working full-stack with a couple of years experience. Im already looking at some standard stuff that might fit me through regular channels e.g. linkedIn, and I will keep looking there. But its a jungle out there, for a guy who doesn't know the job market over there it all could be a hit or miss. \n Hopefully somebody here has been in a similar situation and can share their experience or have any good insights, or even better set me up!

There was a lot of flailing arms, flailing fish, commotion etc as they quickly grabbed and tossed all of the fish into the lake. Some of the fish were massive, so slippery that they were dropped onto the floor and ushered into the water by land.\n A security guard then blew his whistle and they all quickly started praying/meditating, before jumping on their bikes and riding away.\n It was pretty fascinating to watch and our best guess was that it's related to a buddhist fish ceremony. \n Are we correct and does it happen a lot at Hoan Kiem lake? Where do they likely get the fish from if so?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/not_that_much_fun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello I’m not really sure if this is right place to post and please let me know of there is somewhere better to post about this \n Long story short I am Australian and my dad (54M) started dating a Vietnamese woman (37F) right before Covid. How they met I believe was through an ex of his who was also Vietnamese. My dad went overseas a few times in 2019/2020 to visit her before Covid hit and the obviously couldn’t travel again. Then in late 2022 he moved the woman and her kid here into the family home despite myself and brother having never met them \n I am aware he was sending her money while she was overseas and since they have arrived in Australia money is a big source of argument. I believe he is still sending money to her family and that his wife still has a Vietnamese bank account and has asked for his password to his bank account. She has brought up multiple times to me that she had looked to live elsewhere in Australia or go back to Vietnam once the date is up that they meet their visa requirements \n This all seems very concerning to me but I’m interested to hear from the Vietnamese community if this is normal or if she is just using my dad for a visa and is going to leave?\n *Forgot to add they legally got married in Australia in February 2023. Did the fake wedding in Vietnam in 2022 which was to appease family apparently. My brother and I weren’t invited or asked to attend but then randomly two days before got asked write a speech for this woman we had never never met…\n    submitted by    /u/United_Natural_6689  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you’re back people will say you black. If you’re white people say you’re white. But when your EA or SEA or random Asian they say ‘Chinese’??? \n Asia is so diverse, there are Laos, Mongolia, Malaysia, etc. :) Especially Vietnam has a painful history fighting back from China and suffers from cultures destruction and assimilation by Chinese, the feeling is worse. \n I wish one day everyone can be more acknowledged of racial diversity in Asia and ask them more general question like : “Which part of Asian are you from?

Sau khi phát hiện tài khoản bị trừ gần hết hạn mức 50 triệu thì rất hoảng loạn, vì theo cảm quan thì biết là đã bị hack tài khoản rồi, đối tượng sau khi hack thành công thì dùng số tiền này để chạy quảng cáo facebook, vì tin nhắn từ VPBank báo về trên điện thoại với nội dung như vậy. Sau khi gọi điện thẳng đến tổng đài của VPBank yêu cầu khóa thẻ khẩn cấp, thì vẫn thấy chưa yên tâm nên ngay sau đó chạy thẳng ra Ph…",

          "description": "I am considering a move to Ha Giang as it is one of the colder cities in Vietnam, but I am having trouble finding long-term rental listings on Facebook and other real estate websites. I was wondering if anyone else who is an expat currently lives in Ha Giang and could offer me some advice on how to find a place to live.\n I also have some concerns about moving to a smaller city, as I currently live in Hanoi. While I am drawn to the cooler climate and natural beauty of Ha Giang, I worry about the potential challenges of living in a smaller city with fewer amenities and opportunities.\n If anyone has made a similar transition from a larger city to a smaller one in Vietnam, I would love to hear about your experience and any advice you may have. How did you adjust to the change in pace and lifestyle? What were some unexpected challenges or benefits of living in a smaller city?\n Thank you in advance for your help and insights.\n    submitted by    /u/DragonXDT  \n [link]   [comments]",

Obviously my kid struggled to ride it well.\n On the return around, I asked why is the tire deflated? Can you inflate the tire so we can have a better test?\n Their smart answer was, \"It comes from the factory like that. If you want us to inflate it, you'll have to buy it first.\"\n Completely ridiculous. Mind you we are still evaluating and testing the product, and you want us to make a buying decision while the product is unusable? After that conversation, I noticed the handle bar was completely loose. Figures as much why my son struggle to turn the bike. I put the bike back to find another bike. The 2nd bike I found also had a handle bar that was also completely loose from the front wheel. Someone assembling the product in their department needs to be evaluated.\n Why on earth do you setup a display of bikes that are unprepared for test ride for children? Why is your smart response are that the bikes \"come from the factory like that\" an appropriate answer for deflated tires? And why do you expect people to buy it from you while they can't even get normal working conditions to evaluate the quality of a product?\n I didnt expect this type of low end service behavior from buying at a department store, at a big mall no less.\n    submitted by    /u/vubitcry  \n [link]   [comments]",

For instance, a recent video showing a policeman kicking a teenage boy while holding a gun has sparked a surprisingly positive response from some Vietnamese netizens.\n In the video, the policeman can be seen kicking the teen who is already sitting on the ground with a gun pointed at him. However, instead of outrage, some netizens have applauded the officer's actions, with comments such as \"Very good beating,\" \"Always support the police,\" and \"I fully support the police officers like this.\"\n This kind of reaction might seem shocking to those of us living in the Western world, where instances of police brutality are often met with widespread outrage and condemn…",

However, can you recommend which SIM Card/company is better?

(Eg. SuperRich in Bangkok is known for its highly competitive exchange rate). \n \n Or Is it feasible to withdraw money from the ATM? (Again, eg. in Bangkok, you are charged 220 THB right away for every ATM withdrawal so unless you're withdrawing chunk of cash, its just dropping money on avoidable)\n  \nWorth it to drive moped/bike to get around?

Electrical Engineering degree back in 2016. After school I ended up hating electrical engineering and took a job working in media out of college, but I hated that too. Then in early 2020 I switched careers to IT and got a bunch of basic IT certifications. I have been working as IT support for the last 3 years. I am by no means an IT expert, but I at least have some idea of what I'm doing. I also enjoy the work that I do and enjoy learning new skills, which in the IT industry, there seems to be a never ending…",

I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I'm strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.\n As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I'm not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.\n Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats? Anyone here running their own small business or online business in Vietnam and would like to meet for a coffee or beer?\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/KWNBeat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi! I’m a computer scientist graduate looking to relocate from the UK to Vietnam in September. \n I have almost 2 years internship experience with multinational corporations on top of my degree. I’m mostly interested in positions involving cloud, DevOps, networking and operating systems, rather than full time software development. \n How easy would it be for a non Vietnamese graduate to find an entry level position? What would a reasonable monthly wage be? I’ve seen positions ranging from $900-2500, and was wondering what an acceptable range for negotiation would be. Lastly, are there any specific websites I can look for jobs? I’ve currently just been using LinkedIn, Glassdoor and indeed. \n Thank you in advance for your help 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/More_Effective2445  \n [link]   [comments]",

I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn't hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.\n He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn't) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn't even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.\n POLICE are zero help because I don't remember the drivers cab number.

          "description": "So I often get these friend requests from attractive looking Vietnamese female profiles on Facebook. Sometimes they are from Vietnam and sometimes they are in the US. They would chat with me and reveal their scam by trying to get me to sell random stuffs for them on some scam sites that give them commissions. I think they themselves believe that those scam sale sites are legit. \n Another scam is they say they trade options to make money on the side and can help me make money, I never let it go further than that so I don’t know exactly how they do it. However, 90% of them would just chat and talk to me for weeks and months. I entertain them and keep talking to them to see what the scam is but it never comes. I talk to them like a normal respectful person but never show them that I am thirsty. Eventually they just stop talking to me. \n The one thing in common I noticed is that they would edit old photo posts from months and years ago. Why do this? Is it their way of establishing that the profile is legit because they have posts from years ago? Is there ever a legit reason for someone to edit photos from a couple years ago? I am just trying to understand what is it they want from me or what kind of scam it is because it is a lot of time and efforts they go through.

I lived in Hanoi for a couple of years where my learning was very minimal and since moving back to Europe, I would like to improve my level. \n I take online lessons but the time zones make it a bit difficult with a teacher based in Vietnam, so it limits my lessons to an hour a week.\n If anyone here knows anyone that would be able to help me, or point me in the right direction, that'd be perfect. They don't need to be a qualified teacher, just someone who I could practice with, and is able to explain about the grammar/pronunciations aspects.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/SilverDragonfly6794  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it as simple as having a hotel to stay at for the following night and arranging a lift from the hospital back to the hotel?\n What about follow up appointments, I'm not overly keen on staying in HCMC for too long. How about heading to Danang the following day and checking back in at HCMC on the way back to flying out? Were you able to swim and ride a motorbike after the procedure?

I'll be visiting the country in about a month and I'm wondering how much it would cost to buy this product in a local store. Unfortunately, I cannot order it from the official DJI site because I'll be moving around a lot.\n Can anyone recommend the best stores to go to for purchasing this drone in Vietnam? Also, I'm a bit concerned about the legality of flying drones in Vietnam. What happens if the police catch you with a drone? Is it illegal to fly drones in certain areas of the country?\n Thank you for your help and advice in advance. I'm really looking forward to my trip to Vietnam and I'd love to capture some amazing footage with my new drone.\n    submitted by    /u/VirginMillionaire  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n My fiancée and I are planning to take a trip out to Nha Ttrang in September/October. My company does not give me much vacation time - only 3 weeks a year - so for this trip, I am only looking to spend about 7-ish days in VietNam, with a few of them specifically in Nha Trang.\n I make a fairly good income at my job - just shy over $100K USD - and I'm not reluctant to spend $130-$180 a night at a nice hotel with my fiancée. Unfortunately we are in the process of waiting for a Visa, so do not see one another that frequently. My fiancée doesn't care too much about fancy accommodations since she grew up fairly frugal, but I don't mind spending the extra $$ because I'm a little spoiled.\n Anyways, what is everyone's favourite luxury hotel in Nha Trang? We we will be taking a flight from HCM. The 40-50min drive from the airport isn't a deal breaker, so the hotel does not necessarily need to be in a convenient in-between location from airport and the night market.\n We've looked up a few spots already; Queen Ann, Ariyana SmartCondotel, and Panorama by HLG.\n The biggest thing I'm looking for is a comfortably-sized shower for additional intimacy.\n    submitted by    /u/saint_louis_bagels  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. \n We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)\n When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.\n Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better. \n    submitted by    /u/NeatGap1348  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there!\n After searching the subreddit, I've seen several questions about short layovers in HCMC (5-6 hours max). Most of the consensus I've read is that Tan Son Nhat makes that short of a stopover risky, and best to stay in the airport. However, in June I'll be flying in on my way back to Australia and I'll have 10 hours of stopover time from landing to the next departure.\n I already went ahead and got a visa, so that should speed things up. If I factor in 30 min to 1 hour for customs, another 30 minutes or so into the city centre via taxi, and then 30 min to get back to the airport 3 whole hours before my international departure, that still leaves me with potentially 5 hours in HCMC. Worth it in my book! I never thought I'd get to set foot in Vietnam so I'm excited to take the opportunity.\n Where's the best area to wander for 5-ish hours in HCMC? Try some local Vietnamese dishes, get a bit of a sense of what the city is like, any quick interesting sights, etc. I'll be there on a Friday if that makes a difference for any markets or things that will be open.\n Thank you so much!\n    submitted by    /u/Icy_Artichoke_6711  \n [link]   [comments]",

Many of the Mongols jumped into the river to save themselves were killed or drowned. The Viet captured around 400 Yuan warships.\n This victory effectively put an end to the Mongol invasions of Vietnam, though the Viet monarch Trần Nhân Tông, decided to accept the supremacy of Kublai Khan to avoid further conflicts.The failure of the Mongol invasions was however a shattering blow for their supremacy in Asia, and Vietnam's success gave more confidence to the other Asian nations to halt the once invincible Mongol juggernaut.\n ​\n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/qkvw6rm8btsa1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=8231ddda8b97db98de73cf5de71e7719d6e3b8a2\n https://preview.redd.it/dq9syhz7btsa1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=08a9de49981e805dfae4dc973c60ed1bf6ea4e68\n https://preview.redd.it/y3epczd7btsa1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=87aafd1455ae8945698a25c3a68103e1e2e0931e\n    submitted by    /u/LoneWolfInCyberia  \n [link]   [comments]",

At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. \n We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)\n When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.\n Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better. \n    submitted by    /u/Wild-Consequence-517  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since I drink a lot of water, try to avoid plastic bottles and will stay around four years, I'm considering buying a more heavy duty purifier, such as the Bluewater Spirit. https://www.bluewatergroup.com/product/bluewater-spirit/\n Does anyone have experience using such products in Hanoi/Vietnam?

I'd preferably want there to be two capitals, the western capital and the eastern capital, The western capital could be either Sylhet or Chittagong (Chattogram) and the eastern capital could be either Bangkok or Hanoi.

I want these countries that I mentioned to be one country for the greater good (of humanity).

I have spent time all over the country and have been to Ho Chi Minh, Da Lat, Nha Trang, Da Nang and Hoi An. Every city have had its unique feeling and I have loved it so far.\n Now I'm finally in Ha Long, this was supposed to be the real tropical paradise stop with beaches and swimming. Boating through the unique Islands in the bay and just relax before going to Hanoi for the flight back home. \n I decided to go on a bot trip while in Ha Long and just enjoy the almost mystical atmosphere you get boating through the bay between hundreds of small rocky islands.But this absolutely broke my heart, instead of a mystical and paradise like environment we got nothing but waters absolutely full of trash. \n It didn't matter where you looked, it was just full of mostly styrofoam blocks and other plastic waste, but also some random wood and other garbage also floating around. And I'm not surprised that the waters are so littered, there where hundreds of tourist boats in the bay at any given time. Unfortunately this seem to partly be because of over tourism in the bay, and going through Ha Long city there seem to be alot of relatively new developments but 70% of it looked to be empty or abandoned. \n I am just a tourist that get to see this city for a limited time, can anyone from the area tell me more about how you perceive the city's and they bays development over the past few years. And if you have toured Ha Long just as me and have similar or very contrasting experiences, please share. \n Love from Sweden 🇸🇪\n    submitted by    /u/granatfarfar  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now we have got our 30 day visa, but the stamp in the passport says, that we have to leave Vietnam at the 12th April. We want to leave it at the 24th. Then we stayed here 28 days in total. Is it now possible, to expand the permission to stay with our visum without traviling outside of vietnam? Maybe at the immigration office in Hanoi?

I am looking for any and all advice as I formulate my plan of travel. \n Budgeting; if I am trying to keep it mid to low cost how much can I expect to pay per day? I found some posts that said 50$ a day would be sufficient if I stay in hostels, hitchhike, and take the bus places. (That was including lodging). Does this hold true?\n Things to do: as I have no idea what Vietnam is like i plan to soak up as much as possible. I’m told any and all caves are worth a visit. Is there anyone out there who has been to Vietnam before and is willing to share or send me their itinerary? I can taylor it to my needs but i would be forever greatful to you kind stranger. \n If I want to travel to a different country after Vietnam has anyone had experience applying for a multi trip visa? (Google can probably answer that one for me but there’s nothing better than first hand knowledge).\n Any and all wisdom is greatly appreciated. I plan to Only bring a 40-50L backpack too. Is this feesable.? Experienced backpackers, any pointers on what I should pack and how many of each item? I tend to over pack so I would probably do 2 weeks worth of clothes if I can fit it in the backpack but if someone is able to get away with less then i‘d happily pack lighter.\n    submitted by    /u/throwing_tea  \n [link]   [comments]",

The main reason is that there is not much to do, and nowhere worth going to eat. \n It obviously depends on what you like, but if it includes meat, you wont be getting that. Almost all meat here is not what it is advertised as, and will likely destroy your stomach the next day. We spent hours researching restaurants to eat at and compared to the rest of Vietnam, they are really quite pathetic. 4.7-5 star reviews on many restaurant are just an absolute joke. \n Da Lat is a picturesque city with a nice climate this time of year. The hotels are all a bit tired and run down but that is to be expected considering the location. There are some nice bars hidden away for people to discover and you can do some small touristy activities like Crazy House, Coaster, Bike trips but that's about it. \n It is interesting that there are not many honest reviews containing criticism of any places in this country.\n    submitted by    /u/Ripstart01  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I first came here I had world nomads, but they turned out to be no good after I was hospitalised and didn't plan on returning home anytime back to the states. They said that exempt me from getting my claim. Then I had Safetywing but they are more of a (you pay now and file a claim and we will send you the money later) kind of deal. I'm living in HCMC and am just looking for a good insurance plan I can rely on if I do get injured and I can just go to the hospital (Probably Vinmec) and just get helped on the spot no questions asked.
