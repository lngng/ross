They said between the three: Viettel, Mobifone and Vinaphone; Viettel wins consistency and core quality, while Vinaphone wins fastest speed almost 3x the second winner being Viettel. Mobifone eats dirt in almost every metric and I feel blind after reading that report. \n You see, I've been using the same operator for more than a decade and I wonder if there is better fit for my needs, maybe you can find yours here too. I'm first:\n I use Mobifone.\n Connectivity is okay, worse on height, not much 5G. \n Customer service is helpful and does available 24/7. \n Good data package, I paid 300k VND per month for 8GB data daily. There are plenty options. \n Their App works fine for all basic stuff you need, but the UI always feels like still in the Beta stage and not fully functional. That bugged me the most. \n What's your mobile plan and how is your experience?\n    submitted by    /u/Vietfunk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is my second time in Vietnam. The first time I visit Vietnam as a teenage I never heard of the word. I am currently in Vietnam for the second time as an adult and I hear the term Viet Kieu a lot.\n Viet Kieu is a person with Vietnamese blood that is living outside of Vietnam, whether they were born in Vietnam or another country. \n Sometimes people call me a Viet Kieu or I will tell them that I am a Viet Kieu. Now that I think about it, is it a good thing or bad thing? I know is it a way to label us but I have been saying it with pride. \n I know different people have their own opinions about Viet Kieu. People may like or dislike us, think we are rich, or expect us to bring gifts from our country to give to our relatives in Vietnam. They may look down on us because we escaped our home country due to the war or think we are lucky because we were able to create a life outside of Vietnam. We may or may not be rich in our country but the money exchange from our country to Vietnam makes us look rich.\n I rented an apartment with my family and they told me all the Viet Kieu lives in this apartment. My family told me girls will want us for citizenship. My mom told me not to tell people that I am in a Viet Kieu in public because I will get robbed.\n A lot of people try to talk to me in English. When I start talking to them in Vietnamese, they would tell me that they thought I was from overseas. I tell them I was born and live overseas. I do ask the locals about this in person but Reddit is a better platform to be straight up. Some people that I ask are the older generation that lived through the war or the new generation that were born after the war. \n Give it to me straight. Give me your opinion.

Any time he needs to communicate something to me he uses Google translate, and he does know a few phrases like \"thank you\" and \"good night,\" but today he brings his phone up to me and shows me his question, which is that he would like help learning English. \n He asked for my phone number and I didn't want to be rude, so I gave it to him, but he texted me saying he needs someone to help him learn English. \n I'm not really a teacher, and I definitely don't speak Vietnamese. I want to provide some sort of help, because he's always so nice and patient when I'm helping with whatever he needs around the gym, but I'm at a loss for what to say. \n I was hoping maybe reddit would be a good place to find people who understand Vietnamese culture, and might know what sort of help he is looking for specifically?\n (I have texted him asking if he is Vietnamese just to be sure. I really hope that doesn't come off as rude. Just trying my best guys. Waiting on that response)\n (I flaired this as discussion but realistically a flair like \"language\" might be more apt.

          "description": "Hi everyone! My name is Victor, from Saigon Dragon Studios. For a bit more than 2 years now we’ve worked on the RTS game Space Tales, and today we’re making its Steam page public :)\n https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457960/Space_Tales/?beta=0\n Quick background about us: we’ve launched SDS in 2015, as an outsourcing studio specializing in video game 2D and 3D arts. Vietnam (and HCMC) are well known in the video game industry as several top outsourcing companies are located there. A ton of Vietnamese talents have worked on famous games/movies. Surprisingly however, there aren’t many studios in Vietnam who develop and publish their own games (– whenever I am in a game convention for example I always hear ‘ah yes Vietnam, it’s where Flappy Bird was made”, which really annoys me because it’s not representative of the talents Vietnam has.)\n A couple of years ago we decided to start working on our own game in parallel of our outsourcing services, and we wanted to do as much as possible in Vietnam (only music and sounds are being made elsewhere). We still have a lot of work to do on our game, but we would love to hear your feedback on what we have to show for now.\n The teaser for our game can also be watched on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elHEmpUTcEk \n Looking forward to receiving your feedback.\n    submitted by    /u/SDS_SpaceTales  \n [link]   [comments]",

My mom basically forced me to come with her this past June, and I was dreading it bc the time difference, the heat, and the fact that it’s more of a developing country and I’m so spoiled in the Us. Well that was so naive of me because I definitely had an unforgettable experience and vietnam blew me away. \n We backpacked a bit through vietnam, we went to Saigon, Canh Tho, Cu Chi, Sapa, Hanoi, halong bay, phu quoc, Mekong, tay ninh. At first when I landed I couldn’t wait to get back home. But throughout the trip , the sights were in believable, the food amazing, the motorbikes were so fun, and just cruising through the streets people watching of the cities was so enjoyable. There was just so much to see culture wise as well and opened my eyes to a different lens of the world. and now that I’m back home I feel a small heartache which I wasn’t expecting. It’s been 2 days and I’m still thinking abt this trip\n Although some people were rude and inconsiderate, most were so kind, they treated me and my sister like celebrities. (I thought we looked viet but guess not lol) ppl were constantly approaching us saying we were beautiful. Also i noticed that everyone talks to each other like they already know each other, which is so different than in america. I loved vietnam and want to go back again. This trip holds a special place in my heart and I think will trigger me to start travelling internationally more because that was transformative\n    submitted by    /u/jnn-11000  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately I've been struggling with health problems for the last couple of years, and so this trip is very much going to be a relax by the pool type of affair.\n I was considering Hoi An or potentially Sapa for a 10 day stay? The touristy nature of Hoi An is a bit confronting whereas the Northern mountain ranges are attractive as hell to me. Can anyone lend their opinion/give any recommendations for a resort-style stay that isn't going to be busy to the point of stressful?\n Proposed Itinerary\n December 1st - 4th Fly into Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay for a few nights to recover from flight\n December 4th - 14th Bus/train/plane to destination and stay for 10 days\n December 14th - 17th Bus/train/plane back to Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay a few days before departure\n Additional Info\n  \nI should be able to manage around 5,000 steps each day\n Budget is around $4,000 AUD for two people for 17 days (not including flights)\n I'm used to travelling for the adventure so this style of travel will be very new to me.

VN was my first language, so i’m not worried about understanding the language but i probably have a bit of an accent and am not sure how i would blend in or if people would even recognize me as one (i’m kinda pale so people sometimes think im chinese lol). but i’m curious to know what it’s like for others in the same situation. if you were born somewhere else and then came to vietnam how was the experience? were you treated more as a vietnamese or as a foreigner?\n    submitted by    /u/cheesecaketoast  \n [link]   [comments]",

Khi tôi ở đó, tôi đã thử vuốt ve một con mèo mới được giới thiệu với Catfe. Trước khi có thể vuốt ve con mèo, một cô gái tình cờ cảnh báo tôi rằng con mèo mới đến và nó cắn. Dù sao tôi cũng quyết định vuốt ve nó và cuối cùng bị trầy xước, nhưng điều mà tôi vẫn nghĩ sau đó là giọng nói của cô gái đó nghe thật hấp dẫn làm sao. Tôi không nghĩ đến việc bắt chuyện vì tôi muốn nhìn thấy nhiều mèo hơn, nhưng càng nghĩ về tình huống đó, tôi càng nghĩ về cách tôi nên tiếp cận cô gái mặc quần yếm màu hồng đó. Cô ấy không chỉ có giọng hát hay mà còn rất xinh đẹp và thậm chí trang phục của cô ấy cũng rất tuyệt. Nếu điều này đến được với cô ấy, tôi sẽ coi đó là một phép màu. \n ​\n I am an 18 year old male and went to a Catfe during my trip to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam (June 19). While I was there I tried petting a new cat that was introduced to the Catfe. Before being able to pet the cat, a girl just so happened to warn me that cat was new and that it bites. I decided to pet it anyway and ended up getting scratched, but what I kept thinking about afterwards was how attractive that girls voice sounded. I didn't think about starting a conversation because I wanted to see more cats, but the more I think about that situation, the more I think about how I should have approached that girl in pink overalls. Not only was her voice pretty, but she was beautiful too and even her outfit was awesome. If this ever reaches her I would consider it a miracle. \n ​\n Catfe address: CATFE, 119 Đ.

Then you just click on the words and it will translate the word and the phrase.\n You can download it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jorgeperezgomez.flreader2\n Future versions will store the words for future review, provide basic lessons on grammar so the user can read the book, and so on.

I'm rather Western European in my expectations and ways. . . \n My questions are roughly. . .\n  \nif you found your significant other in Vietnam, how/where was that?\n \nhow is the dating process? (I've heard it's extremely slow) Are the kind of locals willing to move faster and/or hook-up, the same kind that you'd want to date or not at all?\n \nfrom dating apps: first dates as coffee dates or wine/cocktail dates? Or something else? (I never invite ppl over directly from apps - I need to feel a personal connection first and also for safety reasons)\n \nis going to a bar/club alone a thing? Or only some clubs/bars are good for this?\n \nultimately, where do you meet people and socialize? I tend to do a lot of \"expat event\" kind of things but, depending on the country, the ppl that show up are not necessarily the nicest.\n \nwould it be very limiting to try and date only other expats?\n \nfinally, what pitfalls you'd warn another foreigner about?\n \n No need to answer each and every. I just want to get an overall impression of what to expect.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Smoke1801  \n [link]   [comments]",

Last week I received news that he had fallen incredibly ill so I booked a last minute trip to Vietnam to visit him for about 3 weeks. Although this isn't exactly a vacation as I plan on helping to care for my dad, I'm sure there will still be plenty of opportunities to go exploring and get back in touch with my Vietnamese heritage.\n Given that I haven't gone by since I was 6 and that I'm from California, I really have no idea how to prepare. What should I bring? What should I be cautious about? What are some dos and don'ts? I'm a pretty open-minded eater and literally wish to try all the things. Any recommendations?\n Other things about me:\n My Vietnamese is decent, I understand the southern accent very well and can get by in terms of speaking, but things get a little rough if the other person has a northern accent. If the other person has a central accent, no way lol. Unfortunately I can't read Vietnamese either.\n I'm terrible at dealing with the heat but can manage if I have to.\n I'm not taking days off work and plan to work (I'm a software engineer director) as well. How's the coffee shop scene over in Nha Trang?\n Any recommendations on what I must do over there on this last minute unplanned trip would also be appreciated!\n Edit: Spelling\n    submitted by    /u/solidiquis1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to show the people here that I’m not a foreigner who only speaks English.\n Here’s the thing - I’m doing job interviews at the moment trying to get a job, but have limited money at the moment. I did a trial lesson at a centre, and after the lesson they asked if I wanted to pay for my tuition fees then and there. The fees were 19.6 for 80 hours (I believe?) but I told them I don’t have the money for it currently due to finding work and not employed. I really want to start learning as soon as possible, but really struggle with apps such as Duolingo and resources like YouTube. I can’t learn anything from there - I get super distracted because of my ADHD and prefer in-class.\n Do you have any suggestions, or should I just wait until I start getting a salary and have more money?

I was initially planning to order it online and have it delivered to Bitexco Tower or any nearby branch but I can't proceed with the website order page. From step 2 shipment details, it doesnt proceed to step 3 select payment. So I might just check and buy it in the actual Samsung Store. Is it true that you cannot buy in the Bitexco branch? The other nearest to my hotel is the 134 Nguyen Thai Hoc St. branch. Anyway, can anyone check the latest price of Samsung S23+ in HCM? I just wanted to check if it's the same as the one in store. Also, if this is the wrong sub to post this inquiry, please help me identify the correct one.\n Since I'm already here, any tips on my upcoming trip? Previously went to Hanoi already. Can anyone perhaps help me identify the correct sequence of how I should plan my route/itinerary to visit the most famous spots in the city?

          "description": "I live a great life in the U.S. but as I am sitting at work, I still think about moving back to Vietnam or how to do so in the future. This obsession has been going on for years now.\n I'm aware of all the pros and cons, it's just that I have this strange yearning to be there. My mom passed away last year and her family is still in Vietnam. We are very close and I want to live near her family before they all pass away as well. They are one connection I have left with her.\n The main issue is that I won't be able to get more than 3-4 weeks vacation off each year from work, and tickets will cost around 8k now. The flight is so long too just for a trip where we'll be spending at least one week with jetlag and stomach issues. Plus, my wife wants to go on vacations/beaches while I just want to near Quan 7 with the relatives.\n I've thought about moving to Orange County or Houston to ease this feeling, but those Vietnamese cities just don't feel the same. \n I know the future is far brighter in 15 years for the family if I stay in the U.S., I just feel sad each day working. I spend hours thinking about having enough money to live in Vietnam without worrying about the future.\n It's not rose-tinted glasses either, I worked remotely and had lived in Vietnam for 6 months recently with my wife/child. It was great. I know education and healthcare might be a problem later on. Waking up early for coffee and breakfast while watching the crazy traffic, going out to eat seafood/hot pot at night - that just can't be beaten.\n I suppose I'm just ranting and being too greedy. I can always get a significant pay cut/career limitation and get a remote job to live in Vietnam. It's just that I want what's best for my family/kid's future as well.\n Does anyone(especially the Viet Kieus) feel the same way?\n    submitted by    /u/baoluvboa  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I live in Vietnam. I went back home and when I came back to Vietnam I brought some souvenirs and gifts. Nothing special. I was brought up \"minimalist\". I never bought fancy gifts for my partners, friends, and family. So, why would I do that to people who are, well, at the periphery of my friendzone?\n And all in all: Isn't it the thought that counts?\n Anyhow, my gifts received some harsh comments. For instance, a Vietnamese friend got some brand clothes from Europe. I bought some toys for his younger brother. Do you know Playmobil? A bit like Lego. I confess, the two toys (a Wild-west Fort and a Pirate ship) were on discount. But they cost about 100$. That is more than I gave to my bf for Christmas, LOL. Anyhow, I can survive that a 10yo doesn't say thankyou and is happy. But my friend said, that his brother was disappointed because he wanted some more \"valuable\".\n I am not on a paylevel which enables me to throw around with MacBooks and Iphones. I do not have such devices neither.\n Another time I was invited and I bought a 25$ red wine bottle. In my home country Germany that would already be too much. Most guests will spend about 10-15$. No one really awaits a 1,000$-bottle of Rothschild stuff.\n Anyhow, the host was quite rude. During the evening he showed my bottle, made a gesture like vomitting and put it aside. Then he presented a fancy Whiskey bottle and told everyone that the bottle was about 200$. This person was not even close to me, so why would I pay 200$ for some alcohol? I am in general a generous guy, but these two examples (there are quite more in my experience) are really too much. I understand, I am the \"rich\" foreigner. But they cannot really await that I come of dozens of Iphones, cars, laptops? I feel really sad, since my personal life is not circling around consumption.\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_Kha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there a way to bridge this gap and create artistically profound and entertaining art, similar to what filmmakers like Bong Joon Ho and Park Chan Wook have achieved in Korea?\n    submitted by    /u/aphdnh  \n [link]   [comments]",

Asked if I'd like to get a drink with him, which I was happy to do!\n Spent some time drinking with him, during which time he told me his family were visiting and they were having a big party. When it was time to go, he asked if I'd buy a bottle of wine for their party, which I agreed to do. He took me about a 10min ride away to a shop to buy wine, which cost 900,000 dong and then took me back to where we met. I realised at the time the wine was very expensive but I was a little drunk and didn't know where I was exactly so I didn't protest.

My wallet only had a few hundred thousand dong and a bank card that I canceled as soon as I noticed my wallet was gone. The bar staff told me to go to the police the following morning because they stop operating at 10pm. \n I didn’t bother going to the police because it would be a waste of everyone’s time for such a small crime. But is this the truth? Or was the staff telling me this so that the police would not come to the bar and ruin the party?\n    submitted by    /u/Stunning_Diver_901  \n [link]   [comments]",

Down alleyways up three flights of stairs to hidden spots. We have dietary restrictions (my husband doesn’t eat pork, which is tough here because 90% of food in Vietnam is based around pork and I’m mostly vegetarian) and she was able to accommodate us and still make the tour authentic and true to Hanoian culture and food. Her English was great and she was easy to talk to and get along with. She really deserves the shout out and recognition.

          "description": "I think for the most part, people in Vietnam are quite laidback and friendly. Why does it change so much when people are driving? A large number of people just turn into selfish assholes as soon as they're in control of a vehicle. Car drivers seem to consider the possibility of slowing down or giving way an insult to their ego. Bike drivers pay little attention to any kind of rules unless they're being watched by police. They'll drive the wrong way, break red lights, use sidewalks, pay zero attention to other traffic and refuse to stop at junctions. Buses and trucks only seem to have an accelerator and a horn. Everybody seems to be in a massive rush to get somewhere, yet when they arrive they just nonchalantly wander around like NPCs. \n What's actually going on? I'm aware it's not everyone and you see plenty of people patiently waiting in traffic while those around them mount the sidewalk, but the sheer number of people that act like assholes on the road is way higher than in other countries. I don't think it just infrastructure because it happens even when the infrastructure is good. I also see people blame lack of education or poor people from the countryside, but you can cross the border into Laos and it's totally different experience\n    submitted by    /u/AnJa1407  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I noticed that the tones of Tiếng Huế sound vastly different from the first two: dấu sắc is lower rather than higher and sounds more like dấu hỏi, and dấu huyền is higher instead of slightly lower, but not as high as a typical dấu sắc. A few days ago I asked a Chinese friend what the four tones in Chinese sounded like, and I realized that they sounded very similar to Tiếng Huế’s tones. Dấu huyền of Tiếng Huế sounds like the falling tone of Chinese and dấu sắc sounds like the rising tone. I can’t speak for whether dấu hỏi/ngã sounds like the down-up tone, as I do not know what hỏi/ngã sounds like in Tiếng Huế. Why do Tiếng Huế’s tones sound similar to the Chinese tones? I’m guessing because Huế was the old capital of Việt Nam, most likely where most of the nobles/elites resided. Being a noble probably meant you probably had be able to speak in Mandarin and write in Chữ Hán/Nom, which likely had an influence on how they spoke Vietnamese.

Vietnam's unique culinary traditions, blending multiple regional styles with influences from China and France, produce some of the world's most iconic and delicious dishes.\n From pho to banh mi, spring rolls to imperial court cuisine, Vietnamese food withstands comparison with the finest culinary traditions anywhere. The creativity, skill and passion of Vietnamese chefs across the country have produced cooking that has long deserved global renown.\n Having 70 Michelin-reviewed establishments will help showcase the diversity and quality of Vietnam's dynamic restaurant scene to an international audience. It will attract more food tourists, boosting the hospitality industry and local economies. Most importantly, it provides deserved recognition for the craftsmanship and dedicated hard work of Vietnamese chefs over generations.\n As a Vietnamese, I have long taken for granted the pleasures of Vietnam's cuisine. But global acknowledgement from prestigious groups like Michelin will be a source of pride for Vietnamese people everywhere. It demonstrates that our culture's softest power - our food - can compete on the world stage. I hope this is just the beginning and that more Vietnamese culinary masters will have their talents spotlighted in the years to come.\n Vietnamese restaurants have earned their place amongst the finest in the world. I hope the Michelin Guide and other international reviewers will help spread the word and introduce more people to the joys of Vietnamese gastronomy. Our chefs deserve this honor - now it's time for the world to feast their eyes and taste buds on what Vietnam has to offer.\n https://vietreader.com/travel/food/85667-70-michelin-honored-vietnamese-restaurants-and-eateries-in-2023-part-1.html\n    submitted by    /u/vinhta121290  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been using Zalo to communicate to my driver and team members when I'm back at my apartment / out of the office (I don't have Facebook, so this was a good alternative while out here).\n Unfortunately, I had to replace my phone last time and Zalo put me through some loops to basically \"re authenticate\" me by having someone already in my Zalo contacts confirm it's me. Naturally, that happened a few days before I flew back out here, so I was unable to get in touch with anyone when I landed (didn't realize this was needed until I landed). I eventually got hold of someone and they did the in-person verification.\n However, ever since then, the Zalo app keeps telling me I need to \"verify\" my account. It has an option to upload a photo of your passport but it doesn't seem to like an American passport. Do I need to verify? How do I do this? Anyone have experience making it work?\n I tried to chat with Zalo support but they only would message me in Vietnamese.

The official word is that power cuts will be occuring daily due to \"El Nino\". \n Over the past week or so, my district (Long Bien) has experienced 5 outages that last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours at a time. We're told about them in the morning, so there isn't much time to plan around them as they start at 8 AM. \n Tonight, we've been told (officially) that the outages will occur each day for the next month. In my 9 years living in Hanoi, I've never experienced this before, yes, occasionally power will cut during a typhoon, but never like this. \n Does anyone else who is currently going through this have a backup generator? Is it worth investing in one? My wife and I run our business from home and we need to be online 24/7. We can't be out of the house for too long as we have 2 dogs that only pee outside and our son comes home for lunch and a nap each day. \n Need advice on how to deal with it. Can't move because we own our property. Should I buy a generator? Have you heard any information about the power cuts that might shed more light than our building's manager has already? Do you know someone who works in the energy sector that has mentioned it to you? Feeling absolutely helpess RN.\n    submitted by    /u/j3d321  \n [link]   [comments]",

They were all talking about how they rent apartments here for peanuts, and simply eat Bahn Mis and plow fresh young Vietnamese chicks on the daily.\n One guy buys like 100 pills of viagra and uses them all in under two months. He’s a lawyer and just has a broker who sends him up fresh meat multiple times a day.\n To be honest, it was kind of repulsive to hear about all this. I’ve been having a great time with the locals and it’s kind of nuts how all these women are getting used and abused by westerners. What do local Vietnamese think about this? They seem to be happy with throwing their daughters to the viagra popping wolves of the west.\n    submitted by    /u/CEO_VandalayInc  \n [link]   [comments]",

Cho đến khi vợ tôi nghỉ công tác tại ngân hàng M… Việc này làm tôi khá khủng hoảng về tinh thần khi làm ca kíp về và liên tục bị trì triết, phàn nàn về nhiều thứ. Và vợ tự sinh ra cái suy nghĩ nghỉ làm thành gánh nặng của tôi, mặc dù tôi cũng rất tán thành việc nghỉ nếu công việc quá áp lực và không hiệu quả về kinh tế. \n Tôi chả biết do nghiệp hay duyên làm tôi có quen được 1 chị tiếp viên hơn tôi 3 tuổi vào đúng thời gian này. Không ai chủ động, chỉ nói chuyện về công việc rồi chia sẻ về cuộc sống, dần rà sau 1 tháng điều gì đến sẽ đến. Vâng, tôi có cãi nhau với vợ và rủ chị kia đi Hạ Long chơi và có qhtd. Ban đầu mục đích của tôi chỉ là giải toả căng thẳng, bằng một cách thần cmn kỳ xong chị ta yêu tôi. Rồi ngày qua ngày, việc chị ta cứ chia sẻ công việc (cùng ngành) mua đồ, quan tâm đến tôi cũng làm tôi có chút rung động :)\n Thực sự việc này tôi đã biết là sai ngay từ lúc rủ chị ta đi Hạ Long, tôi cũng vẫn rất yêu vợ mình chứ. Nhưng bản tính tham lam và râm tục của tôi làm tôi vẫn muốn giữ mối quan hệ này :( Chị ta cũng biết tôi có vợ và vẫn chấp nhận làm người thứ 3… Sau khi chia sẻ những lời này thì tôi vẫn đang có một gia đình đáng yêu và vẫn duy trì mqh ngoài luồng.

They always say that too much salt or sugar is used. They also say this is why American food is so unhealthy.\n I’ve mainly been raised up in the US and eat both Asian and Western cuisines but never found this to be true. I’ve always found most foods to be reasonably seasoned to my tastes. I’ve asked friends and family around my age, and they also generally agree with me. I also believe the whole “American food is unhealthy” myth to be untrue because that really only applies to fast food which you really don’t eat on a daily basis. It’s also a huge over generalization of American cuisine considering how diverse each region and state is. I digress though.

Unfortunately, I do not know a lick of Vietnamese. \n I'm struggling with two things: \n A) I'd like to be able to find a correct translation of the Vietnamese word for descent. I've tried a bunch of websites including Google Translate and ChatGPT and they all come up with different answers and \n B) I'd like to be able to come up with a realistic name, something that actually sounds believable, if that makes sense.

But they clearly didn’t, and even talked badly about it during the movie. EDIT: It was too artsy and chaotic for them. Too much going on.\n It’s okay if they didn’t like it since we are worlds apart when it comes to media consumption. I just hate that they didn’t at least stay and experience the movie with me and my brother. It had been a while since we had gone out to the movie theaters as a family.\n To make it worse, my brother is very hot tempered and told them to shut up several times while they were critiquing the movie, and even as they were walking out. I get where his frustration is coming from, but I don’t agree with how disrespectful he was. \n They waited for us outside in the car. On the ride home, I tried to keep the conversation light even if I was slightly annoyed. \n But the tension was clear. And when they confronted my brother about snapping at them, they all started yelling at each other. \n We just got home and there was a lot of door slamming. I feel really sad.

I am solo travelling and just can't seem to meet people and have remotely lengthy conversations. I keep trying but it doesn't seem to be working. I'm currently in hanoi (old quarter). I've been walking around all day, searching online and trying to find events or language exchange communities. Looking online everyone seems to be saying its super easy to meet people here so I don't know why I'm struggling. I am usually very confident talking to people back home, but it seems this language barrier is impeding me more than others.\n Any advice would be much appreciated as I'm a very social person and tend to be far happier when with people.\n    submitted by    /u/jpro9000  \n [link]   [comments]",
