So if you've purchased liquids in the terminal they will confiscate them.\n If you ever have the chance, please let them know that they are full of shit, because we just checked with Australian Biosecurity here and they have confirmed that policy is an airline policy even though when you are boarding the plane they claim it is an Australian policy.\n Probably just trying to force you to purchase their cash only in-flight beverages.\n F*** VietJet.\n Edit: To be absolutely clear, we are talking about an additional restriction at the boarding gate, not the normal security check where we all know liquids must be surrendered.

So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:\n  \nIs Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?\n Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. I have read multiple places that Phu Quoc is overdeveloped and does not give you that \"island life\" feeling. Is there enough to do on Con Dao\n Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)\n  \nAny suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :) Thank you for all answers!\n    submitted by    /u/newyogaguru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry for the rant. But some of the public colleges and primary-high schools in HCM City keep setting back the GODDAMN TIME in which morning classes start. The old time usually was 7:15 or 7:30am, then it back to 7am, and now it become 6:45am (Some schools like HCMC University of Industry and Trade set to as early as 6:30am)\n When asked about this decision, 2 of the most popular answers from the school speaker are: - To avoid heavy traffic --> They seriously thought \"If the traffic is usually jammed at 7am, then why don't we just start the school at 6:45am?\". To me, this is such a dangerous one-sided thinking, which disregard students whose houses are very far from school. Doesn't even mention student now even have less time for breakfast anymore if they wake up at 6 o'clock or later. Plus, people who don't want to deal with heavy traffic are already aware to get up early, you don't need to force everyone has to go more earlier, as long as they go to school before it starts.\n  \nTo prevent student from coming late to class and to encourage them to wake up early--> There is no scientific research stated that the earlier the school start, the lower the student coming to school late. School in US and Europe begin at atleast 8 am so student can have good sleep, which they've done countless researches before. Again, dangerous one-sided thinking to me. As a grad student, I have twice to tripple amount of assignments despite sleeping less comparing to my time in high school. From my experience, it encourages more people to go to class late lol. My friends said this is dumb, and they ended up always going late or only go to second class (8:30 - 10:10am).\n  \nSorry if you find this rant and broken English annoying. I'm 2nd year grad student and I'm tired of waking up in 5am so that I can take buses in 5:40 to get to school in time. The reason I wrote this post so I can relieve some stress from constant complaining against my school. Hope you forgive me.\n    submitted by    /u/Vietcong777  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry if this is not the right place to post this but I just want to get this off my chest to s community like this. For some context I was born in Hanoi and adopted into a US family at 8 months old - I have nothing as far of information regarding my parents, just my birthday and where I was found abandoned. I got the chance to visit Vietnam for the first time in 16 years since I was born last month. I got to experience the city and the wonderful people and I got to go to my orphanage. I got back to the US just 2 weeks ago and I just miss Vietnam so much - part of it just feels like home to me and I just miss the whole vibe and general culture of the country. I have never traveled to a place where I just felt so in place and “normal” with people who were genuinely interested in me and cared about me. It honestly was an experience nice and feeling that I really cannot put into words. I am not normally a person to express my emotions like this but I just had to get it out somehow sorry this was more of a post about my feelings and more about myself 😅. Anyways thanks for reading - sending love ❤️.\n    submitted by    /u/Greedy-Remote2973  \n [link]   [comments]",

He gets on his phone and coordinates with another driver to take me in their car instead. We stop at a gas station, and I get out with my pet carrier and begin to get into the other car. My driver opens the trunk to retrieve my luggage, closes the trunk lid right away and holds up a 100k bill to show me as he hands it to the new driver. I am in agreement as it seems fine with the exchange of funds to the new driver, and I pay the first driver once my ride completes.\n As I am about to enter the new car, I realize I am missing my large totebag. I tell my original driver, hey I'm missing my other bag. So I go over to the car and he opens the trunk and reaches in and retrieves my totebag. I see the totebag is placed in the trunk in a small, recessed area that just seemed odd. I didn't think much of all this at first, but at the end of the day, this incident has kept me thinking I was trying to be robbed. My totebag contained all my essential items.\n tldr: grabcar drivers says he is sick minutes into a ride, gets me a replacement car and driver and forgets to transfer all my luggage to new car.\n    submitted by    /u/d4rkc4sm  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:\n  \nIs Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?\n Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. Is there enough to do on Con Dao\n Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)\n Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :)\n  \nThank you for all answers!\n    submitted by    /u/newyogaguru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been in vietnam for over 2 weeks now and I've been really depressed about the racism I'm facing here. To give some context, I'm chinese and indian, quite dark skinned, female. \n The counts of racism I've faced here is absolutely disheartening, maybe because of my background, I tend to notice the implicates of it. Other - I've been really well behaved, trying to break the misconceptions about my countrie(s) not because I deliberately want to, but because that's how I am. I'm introverted, am always polite, tip well, do not indulge in the bad stuff. \n  \nAt the hotel I was in, I saw white tourists get upgraded and also an Asian Australian man get upgraded (their original rooms were not available). In my case I was asked to wait 3 hours for my room, when I asked if I could pay for a better room, they happily obliged. This happened on the same day, around the same time. \n \nCustomer service - Specually in hotels again, I saw how other customers were treated over me. Unfortunately, I did notice a theme going around with the skin tone. I saw a couple who came in after me order much more elaborate dishes, it was only after they finished almost eating, was I served my very simple dish. \n \nThe cherry on top, I took a tour to a popular tourist guide with a English speaking tour guide, he went on to speak about how brown skin is not considered beautiful in vietnam, that it's ugly, relates to poor and bad behavior as he himself was brown, he did not have good experiences in vietnam with his love life, job etc.. this really broke my heart. This country is supposed to have the kindest of people, having read the previous threads too, I didn't expect to have this experience in Vietnam of all places. \n \n I just wanted to share this with all the people of colour who keep asking this question if the vietnamese are racist. Here's your answer. Ofcourse, it's not as blatant, or direct, but hurtful nonetheless.\n    submitted by    /u/Pale-Quiet9320  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not like \"conscription\" stuff but, keeps organizing random events and forces students to participate, and if not, deduct bunch of \"diem ren luyen\" or whatever. I just feel like students should have the rights to whether to go or not. Like recently, my university had some sort of Shoppe-sponsored event and of course, to make the sponsors happy, they force every students to attend, standing in the sun for 1 hour then listen to annoying love-related songs about bunch of \"I love you then you dump me\" non-sense. Or forcing students to clean up construction debris in the university. Wow, unpaid working. 10/10, Law university. And upcoming, another sport event that if they didn't threaten to deduct points, probably no one would attend because 90% of the students aren't bothered to wake up at 8AM in Sunday, just to watch bunch of fellow university students playing badmintons and running.\n I understand the morality behind the non-sense of that points system, for \"đánh giá về phẩm chất chính trị, đạo đức, lối sống của sinh viên trên năm mặt đánh giá\" but using this so that the teachers can prove that \"my university organizes events and the students are totally not enforced to come and this will do very well for publicity\" is not really a good excuse to use this points system. Because some university students have their own life to deal with and should not be forced to participate in events that for a lack of better words, they don't give a f- about (there're defo better words). Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Students have their own life and you having free time doesn't mean you should torture the students. \n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/PieNextDoor  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of the items is cash.\n Apparently vietnam customs allow you to bring $5000USD or equivalent foreign currencies in cash without a need to declare. But for their own currency, they only allow travellers to bring in 15million VND which is $620USD equivalent. Anymore than 15million VND in cash has to be declared. That is so weird? Anyone has any experience of bringing in more than 15million dongs in vietnam? Do you actually need to declare? If you did, what did they do? Do they just straight up confiscate the difference?\n Edit: People seem confused so I’ll explain further: \n Guys I am talking about arrivals. Not departure. I’m BRINGING IN 30million dong cash to vietnam to SPEND. I’m NOT BRINGING VND OUT of vietnam. I dont understand why would they limit the bringing of their currency that’s the most legal and accepted to be used in their country so severely.

There's a 99% guarantee that out of all the empty tables, they'll choose to come and sit right next to me.\n  \nMotorbike parking will be totally empty but I can guarantee someone will park their bike right next to mine (and bang my mirrors while doing so)\n \nI'll go to the park to relax while it is mostly quiet. Despite being empty, the one group of Vietnamese will almost definitely come and sit right near me. \n \n Is it a deep rooted fear of being alone or just a desire to piss off other people?

Nevertheless, I wonder how the Vietnamese state, the society and individual are interested in their Vietnamese cultural heritage. Do people offer it at school like how many western nations may also offer to teach a dead language like latin? Do people use it for modern poems and literature?\n What I personally love about Chinese style characters isn't just the aesthetics, but the connection and meaning that each character holds. They don't just decorate the temples and literature of the past. For example, did you knew that the family name Ngô 吳 does not refer to maize/corn 玉米 , which is also called ngô in Vietnamese? I did not for a long time. I think the usage of Chinese characters can make some differentiation in phonetically same sounding words and its kinda neat.\n I also find concepts and attempts like Quốc âm tân tự and chữ Nôm mới very interesting.\n    submitted by    /u/Thuyue  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I'm wondering how expats living in Vietnam handle their health insurance?\n I am moving to Vietnam soon for work (my employer does not provide health coverage), and I plan to take out some travel insurance initially to cover any accidents or emergencies, and then find a health insurance plan provider after I arrive. Not sure if this it the best way of doing it though.\n Does anyone have any recommendations or advice? I'm interested to hear how you insure yourself and which providers you recommend.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/LongVivid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just had the worst train experience in my whole life. I and my friend went to buy the bunk beds for our 7 hour trip. The toilets are too filthy as they pissed all over it and there is not enough space, it likes you are locked inside a cramped closet with piss filled every fucking corner. The train shaked and as it stopped it almost made me fall into those piss filled corner in the toilet. The noise I could endure but there was a family with little kids who kept kicking the wall during the night. The staff smuggled people so they can charge 10$ per bunk bed while when we officially bought the tickets it was 30$ per seat. As we only bought 2 seats, the 10$ illegal bought beds above us hung their feets right above our head, kicking in the beds so we could not sleep for the whole night. And the train staff, seeing that we realized she smuggled people onto the train and felt we bought our beds so she couldn't make anymore money, treated us as garbage and was being rude the whole ride. I doubt they ever change their attitude or service so I won't ever get on a train in Vietnam for my long ride anymore. It was not worth it. I was very tired and both disgusted and angry with suck an awful train service.\n    submitted by    /u/mo57189  \n [link]   [comments]",

It states that she is wearing the national costume donated to her by the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture.\n I am curious if the song is accurate. Is she really singing in Vietnamese?

Can I go around on my own?

          "description": "Hi, I am currently in Vietnam and plan to do the Ha Giang Loop from 12/19-24. I have come across multiple posts discouraging booking a guided tour. I am currently riding from HCMC to Hanoi and rented a bike from Tigit. They have an interesting option where one can rent a guide for $140 a day (plus all expenses for the guide). I was maybe thinking if anyone would want to join, we could split the cost of the guide and have our own smaller tour. This would not be an \"easy-rider\" situation and you would have to ride your own bike. Tigit also rents bikes and gear for a fee. Link below for the guide. Thank you.\n https://www.tigitmotorbikes.com/tours/rent-a-tour-guide/\n    submitted by    /u/modlab4  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It's kind of weird seeing all this talk about \"western\" stuff in this sub. Some people here toss around this strange idea of \"western\" and it just feels way off to me. It's like \"western\" only accounts for the image of the USA. As a German, I don't feel represented by that concept at all.\n Germany and the USA are worlds apart politically and culturally, despite both being tagged as \"western\". Alone in Europe there is so much cultural differences.\n And then there's the comment sections, turning into what feels like an active war. You got one group throwing a bunch of untrue, mostly negative stuff about Vietnam, and another group firing back with a pro-Vietnam vibe while dissing \"the West\", saying so much stuff that basically only applies to the USA.\n    submitted by    /u/Trivus1  \n [link]   [comments]",

So a bit of background information: We both live in the Netherlands he goes to school here and says he has both a Dutch and a Vietnamese passport and he is now 18. But he told me that when he was 17 he needed to go to Vietnam for mandatory military service for a year and that he was a Sergeant-Major. Is this even possible because from what I could find you can only start service in Vietnam when you are between 18-25 and I doubt that becoming a Sergeant-Major is easy. So is he telling the truth or is he just telling some made up story for some \"clout\"? \n    submitted by    /u/Sir_Valentino  \n [link]   [comments]",

More often than not, they were unfair and often was due to a misunderstanding. I had thought that part of the reason was his years spent in prison, but apparently this was just how he was. When I had vented to my aunts and uncles about it, they specifically told me a story about my dad beating my aunt when she was 8 because she accidentally dropped a christmas light that shattered (he’s between 10-15 years older than her, for reference).

I saw them watch several meaningless and no value contents (in many topics, for example: cancer maker (without any verification), some dudes telling you how to live a life lol) then they share to us with the thought that it’s a reference that we should follow and absorb. It’s hard to say but I feel like the social media is changing the middle-aged people’s mental health. I think because they aren’t growing up with the social media like us (late of Gen Y and on) so they are lacking of “pick and choose tools” when using social media. They are the most vulnerable social media users I think. What u think bout this? Let’s share some thoughts or any practical case?\n    submitted by    /u/Bel-Maniac-0853  \n [link]   [comments]",

So we danced a little and they immediately offered us their booze (don't really know what it was, maybe banana wine?), we drank one glass but they really really wanted us to drink more, at some point we really had to push them off. When we figured we want to leave they grabbed us by the hands (as if to keep on dancing with us) and they where actually holding unreasonable firmly, one might even call it violently. At the end we managed to shake them off and just wave them goodbye.\n It's important to note, the whole settings where very friendly, there where Children, women and elderly in the party, so we don't think those guys had bad intentions and do us harm.

I’m new to the community but would like some help choosing a name from the members of this sub!\n I am a 2nd generation Vietnamese-American with both parents from south Vietnam. I have gone through many names during my time of being kinda out as trans-masculine and all of them have been either generically white male names or just English words. I’m hoping to legally change my name soon to something more permanent and closely tied to my culture. I have been immersed in Vietnamese culture and tradition ever since I was a child but when I was born I was given an American name instead of a Vietnamese one. I used to be grateful for this because it reduced the amount of bullying I got for being Asian but now I just want a name that connects to the culture and people that raised me.\n I’d just like some suggestions from other Vietnamese people on male names :) I’d also accept and consider just object names! I used to go by Zero at one point so I’m no stranger to non-name sounding names lmao\n Thank you in advance! :D\n    submitted by    /u/Skyfly_r  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This accident happened about 10 meters in front of me today and in real time. Probably a 3-4 year old kid standing on the motorcycle with both his parents sitting in front and behind him, and as always, he wasn't wearing a helmet but the parents were.\n The dad driver did a close maneuever to overtake a public bus but probably forgot about the son standing right behind him. Consequently, the kid's head collided with the side mirror of the bus, causing him to lose balance and fall off the bike. But lucky enough, he fell AWAY from the bus or else it would be a much bloodier scene.\n I don't get this, you can afford a bike, you can afford two helmets each for yourself and your wife, you can afford clothes, you can probably afford a smartphone as well, but a child's helmet crosses the line? Here's an unpopular opinion, if you can't financially & mentally afford a child's helmet, then you probably shouldn't have a child. Don't even get me started on letting your child stand on a moving bike. It was a cringey horror scene but I kinda felt like it should happen more often for them to finally learn.\n    submitted by    /u/mojotarts  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n First of all, my situation:\n I've been living in HCMC for almost 2 years now but I'm thinking of leaving. My reasons are the high rent, the noise and air pollution, and the traffic.\n Rent here is the highest in Vietnam I think, higher than in Ha Noi I've been told.\n About noise, I tried lots of places and honestly outside of \"luxury\" high rise appartments, other places are affected by noise at night or early morning to the point of being unlivable. I got really depressed once because a place a rented had neighbours arguing all day, karaoke and loud drunk talking at night, funerals,... \n About air pollution, it's worse these days, I can see smog most time I look outside from a high enough floor.\n Traffic is also getting worse. I came to HCMC right at the end of COVID quarantine so it was somewhat normal then, then it got gradually worse. \n Now my question: I'm considering moving to another city, probably Da Nang. Is Da Nang really better in terma of rent, noise, air and traffic? I've been there once and think it's better but it was just a short trip so I'm not sure, heard some stories about karaoke in Da Nang so I want to hear more from everyone.\n    submitted by    /u/assmoede98  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just a small bedroom and bathroom, no living room or anything. \n I wanted to check the electric meter outside my room so I turned off electronics and it wasn’t moving. So far so good. \n I don’t use the fridge , so it’s been off the whole month. Most of my electric usage is for my A/C that runs about 12 hours per day. Otherwise the only other electricity I use is for charging my laptop, or my projector if I’m using it (rarely).\n Electric bill comes in at the end of the month a staggering 1 million vnd!

He says he’s paying around 400k for the entire house! \n Now I know the price per KW is 3.000 vnđ, but the landlords make a profit by charging 4.000 vnd.

I had been using a book to figure out what all fruits can be added (as main or substitutions) in it and it mentioned figs as one of the substitution that can be added on the tray and it stuck with me and I made a design with that as well. Now I found some websites that claimed figs are not used at all and its making me nervous as I don't have enough time to remove it from the design before I am to showcase the collection for marking. So before I chuck it out of my collection, I thought I should come here amd ask you guys. What do you think I should do?\n    submitted by    /u/Master-Wealth-2883  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have no prior exposure of the language or country whatsoever so I really am clueless about Vietnamese culture. However after doing a little research I found out that people are divided on what the standard dialect of Vietnamese is. Google articles say the standard dialect is Northern Vietnamese but will also tell you that you should learn the Southern dialect instead and materials that teach you the Northern dialect I've noticed are kind of frowned upon. I really have no idea what these mean Which sounds stupid I know but that's why I'll take the time to learn. Does it really matter which dialect I will learn between those two? Are the differences between the two dialects really that noticeable to the point of miscommunication? I also noticed that learning Vietnamese is also not as accessible as learning other languages like Chinese or German so if anyone has/know any free resources to learn Vietnamese then I'd appreciate if you'll share it in the comments...

          "description": "Lần đầu viết bài, văn có lủng củng không hay thì mọi người thông cảm giúp mình nhé. Thật lòng không biết bắt đầu câu chuyện thế nào. Mình năm nay 19 tuổi, sống ở Ninh Bình. Đáng ra giờ này mình đang năm 2 đại học, tuy nhiên vì 1 số biến cố mà mình vẫn đang ở nhà nuôi mộng đại học. Và quãng thời gian này mình đang cảm thấy rất tuyệt vọng, mình có những kế hoạch, và mình sợ nó sẽ mãi không thành hiện thực. Để tập trung vào chuyện học hành thì mình đã bỏ hoàn toàn fb, zalo và các bạn của mình thì đang học đại học. Vì thế nên mình không còn ai để nói chuyện cả, và việc không giao tiếp với ai ngoài gia đình thực sự làm mình suy sụp. 1 số lúc thôi, nhưng lúc nó xảy ra mình không biết ứng phó thế nào. Rất căng thẳng, mình cảm thấy bản thân vô dụng, là 1 thằng ăn bám. Suy nghĩ của mình rất rối. Mình cần người để nói chuyện, tâm sự. Tuy nhiên mình lại nghĩ rằng làm thế để làm gì? Cũng không đạt tác dụng gì cả. Làm thế chẳng khác nào thừa nhận rằng bản thân yếu đuối, phụ thuộc vào người khác. Nó đến tự nhiên và cũng rời đi rất tự nhiên. Giờ tự nhiên mình thấy bình thường rồi. Chắc chỉ đơn giản viết ra suy nghĩ của bản thân là đỡ. Sao cần phải nhờ người khác khi tự giải quyết được nhỉ. Good luck brothers. \n Tuy nhiên ai có cách hay thì cho vào đây nhé, mình sẽ rất biết ơn. \n    submitted by    /u/Honest-Marketing-301  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Been here for a a week now and as a solo traveller, Ive been enjoying the solo experience, I often go to eat alone, do activities alone and drink at bar and all sorts of stuff but I never feel lonely at all no ! \n Don't get me wrong, there were moments were I want to share moments but it makes me appreciate humanity and people a lot more. \n A lot of travellers and locals often become surprised at the fact that I just do things independently and tell me things like \" I'm too scared to be alone\" or \" Aren't you scared?\" Or \" Where's your boyfriend?\". \n Scared of what ? Scared of not being able to be comfortable in my own skin? I'd be more afraid of that tbh! \n The reason why I never feel truly alone or lonely is being I'm at a state of being where I feel content in the present moment, I want to soak it all up and enjoy the time I have here, I talk to people if I want to connect but I also have this freedom to also experience my inner world with the world outside of me and for the time I have here I want to be able to experience that.\n So for another question, what do the introverts or freespirits do here as well in Vietnam?\n    submitted by    /u/deeragunz_11  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had a few questions lingering from the trip on my mind, which I wanted to just hear discussion on.\n 1) As title states, why is PQ so empty? It reminds me of a nicer Cancun/Cabo and the people are amazing. For some reason there was ZERO people at Grand World when we visited during the day and then it wasn't even that busy at night either. The shops seemed fake but they actually had workers when we went in so I'm still confused.\n 2) Is tourism down in VN in general this year? Why is that? A lot of the Grab drivers were letting us hire them for the full day and we would just have to pay the Grab rates(or less) and they didn't charge at all for waiting time... (for example if we went to Grand World for 5-6 hours, he would just charge us for the ride there and back)\n    submitted by    /u/jackjohnsonbush  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tao còn có một thằng anh, nó phá nhà cửa tới nay mấy tỷ bạc, tao thì biết làm ăn nhưng bả kiềm hãm tao lại, dành tình thương cho nó nhiều hơn tao. Còn tỷ tỷ chuyện nữa mà tao làm biếng nói tiếp, nhưng cái mà tao luôn hoang mang về bản thân tao là t cũng có một số lần mốt giết bả, hoặc tao chết hoặc bả chết, bả ác với tao quá.

In my last few days in Hanoi before flying out I redownloaded Pokemon Go just to see what's up, and on my last day there I caught a Beldum with perfect IVs.\n Now, I learned a little Vietnamese (mostly so I could order food in a restaurant from a Vietnamese menu) but I don't exactly have a wide vocabulary. I wanted to nickname that Beldum something Vietnamese and was wondering, for any pokemon fans here, if you have any good ideas for what you might nickname a Metagross.\n Otherwise I'm gonna be stuck calling the thing \"Bánh mì\", and it deserves better.\n    submitted by    /u/cool-but-not-really  \n [link]   [comments]",

Of course we would be very tactful if we could, just explaining that it is not the norm in this culture to give such an exorbitant gift.

          "description": "I never had real Vietnamese food before, but I found a small restaurant in my neighborhood recently and now it has become my favorite! I usually don't eat soups because I find them boring, like the classic veggie or chicken soup that almost everyone makes, or tomato soup, potato soup and so on. They're ok, kinda bland sometimes, but nothing special to me. \n But the first time I tried Pho Bo, it just blew me away, the combination of flavors is just spectacular. Now whenever I go to this restaurant, I always start with a Pho Bo. Then I continue with other stuff like Bahn Mi, Bún chả and others that I forgot their name and struggle to pronounce them, but I'm trying to learn. I think it's good to learn their real names, it's a sign of respect and appreciation. \n I also like that they're playing traditional Vietnamese music on speakers, I find it very relaxing. And the people there are also very friendly and hospitable, which makes the whole experience so much better.\n A huge thank you for all the food you bring to the world!\n    submitted by    /u/stefan714  \n [link]   [comments]",

Food is fair priced.\n So it just doesn't make sense to me. - how much people earn here, on an average? - if people aren't earning much, how are they able to afford such expensive things? - what is normal mentality people have regarding finances and savings.

Now let me qualify that. \n When you get to know Vietnamese people, they are great. Some of my best friends are Vietnamese. People I would trust with my kids. They’re kind, gentle, caring, and generous. But this is a one-on-one thing. \n Then there’s the public culture. When the cloak of anonymity drops and no one knows you, people are often vile and selfish. The noise, the littering, the way people drive, elevators, queui…",

          "description": "I’ve read a couple of posts/ comments on this sub about experiences of black people in Vietnam. One said that in Vietnam black people are thought to be, aggressive or dirty or unlucky and should expect racism, and not be treated like other tourists, i.e. in a welcoming way. I realise no country is free of racism (some are worse than others) but is it likely to be so apparent that it negatively impacts my experience of Vietnam? If so I would like some insight so I know what to expect.\n I’ve travelled to a handful countries in SE Asia most have friendly locals and I didn’t feel any different to any other travellers. Except in two-ish cases. One country was memorable for people handing me babies to take photos and basically being in a zoo like situation and in another I experienced constant racism, being called a ghost people whispering behind your back, not being served like other people in restaurants etc. The only place I was treated well in that country, was the hotel I stayed at. I plan on going back to the first country because as tiring as that became, after the novelty of being an instant celebrity wore off, the people were not inherently racist just not exposed and they were actually lovely people. The second I will avoid for as long as I can.\n I plan on making the most of this trip either way because I like to experience new places but some insight would be helpful so I can be mentally prepared. It’s a short trip so I’ll only be going to HCMC and Nha Trang. Apart from a few trips to areas near these places, I won’t be venturing anywhere else.\n    submitted by    /u/Icy-Tea2090  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been to Thailand before but since my wife wanted the feel of it, I have included a week. Need suggestions if thats a good idea. Vietnam itinerary- Land in Hanoi on 12th Jan. 3 nights Hanoi/Ha Long and nearby 1 night in train/bus to Da Nang 2 nights in Da Nang 1 night in Hoi An or vice versa 1 night in train/bus to HCMC 2 nights in HCMC\n On 22nd Jan, flight from HCMC to Chiang Mai.\n 2nights in Chiang Mai 1 night travel to BKK BKK to Phuket flight 2 nights in Phuket/Krabi Phuket to BKK flight 2 nights in BKK/Pattaya On 29th Jan, Monday, back to India.\n Thailand itinerary is not finalised yet just a rough thought on the above as on my previous trip I have already covered BKK, Pattaya, Phuket, Koh Samui and the full moon party. This trip was before Thailand legalised weed. I am also considering Thailand this time as both of us want to experience the weed culture now along with the new places like Chiang Mai, Krabi etc. Currently i have only booked the departure to Hanoi on 12th Jan, planning to book HCMC- Chiang Mai and BKK to delhi back, by tomorrow. Please help guide if I am doing the right thing.\n    submitted by    /u/RichSomewhere18  \n [link]   [comments]",

My favourite meal was when I had a local home cooked meal prepared by the wife of the caption who was taking us on a tour on Ha long bay. \n Lastly, the people. I have never met such wonderful, accommodating and most admirably hard working individuals in any other place in the world. Some people on this sub say that people nag tourists to buy stuff, but I see that as them working hard to earn their keep.

          "description": "I’m not sure my English is correct. How much should women often “challenge” their Vietnamese partners for wedding?\n Introduction of myself: I am Chinese girl living in Hanoi. My sister and brother-in-law moved their factory here in 2018. I saw them having a good life here . They can afford having kids which is nightmare in China nowadays. So I decided to move and work here. I’m 24 years old, and it’s time to think about serious traditional relationship. My brother in law introduced me his Vietnamese customer. He’s a great and humorous guy. He’s running 3 clothes stores and online shops. We’re having good relationship and I think about marriage. In China, women’s families often expect wedding presents as cash from men. In my home province in China, it’s often 100000 cny (340 million vnd). I don’t expect the same amount in Vietnam. May be our tradition can be different. I’m curious how much I should expect from my future Vietnamese husband.\n I’m ready for marriage life here. My personal finance is good. And I improved my Vietnamese a lot. I can sing See Tinh well 😁. It’s very easy for Chinese to pronounce Vietnamese words.\n    submitted by    /u/Express-Sleep-7219  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm no Freddie Mercury by any means, but it has to be something in the water here making people tone-deaf.\n I just got to my girlfriend's house, she has been really sick for a week, and despite knowing that the neighbors have been playing karaoke nonstop. Extremely selfish? Yes. But, I'm currently listening to what sounds like a roadkill dying and I want to stab my eardrums out with chopsticks.\n How is this legal? In every other place I've ever lived, the police would shut this tragedy of a performance down asap. Is it the way the language sounds or are people supposed to sound like they're drowning when they sing?

          "description": "I expected people to do research to know what to expect and today alone theres 2 posts about scam taxis in TSN. I get it, its a mess of an airport. Sometimes its a maze just to navigate so ill try to make it easier. I assume u have downloaded grab before the trip to SEA, and u can pay in cash.\n If u dont have any data, it is possible to ask your hotel to arrange transportation. Usually higher end places can do this. Somebody will hold a sign with your name at the arrival gate. Airport wifi kinda wacky sometimes\n If u arrive from international airport, once ur out of the airport, go across the street to the parking lot. There are prearranged Grab vehicles spots where they can pick u up. Book them and head there asap\n If u arrive from domestic, its a lil annoying but doable. Leave the domestic terminal and head to the building across, this is the parking building.\n parking building\n Head straight pass all the shophouses and little kiosks to the parking lot looking area\n ​\n Grab pick up area\n Grab's designated pickup area is on lane D1, from pillar a5 to l5. Book em and wait for em here.\n Do:\n - Turn on location on grab so the grab driver know where u are\n - Ignore all the trip or taxi sellers on the way\n - Keep an eye on exact pickup location. Grab gives u a range of pillar (ie d5 to j5). Stay at the right place so the driver can pick u up on time. They only have about 3 minutes\n - Check if its the right plate number, cant even tell u how many people forgot bout this\n DONT:\n - Take any taxis other than Vinasun or Mai Linh. Even for these 2 brands they tend to send \"VIP\" taxis that charge u at higher rate\n - Spend time listen to anyone dissuate u from taking ur booked ride for \"cheaper\". Tell em u had a ride and move pass em\n - Let ANYONE even touch ur wallet. Like tf??\n Airports are hotspots for scams, its like this for any country. Its the same shit outside of Charles de Gaulle or Beijing. Stay vigilant and enjoy ur trip\n    submitted by    /u/IDontKnowVietnam  \n [link]   [comments]",

Generally I enjoyed the show. The choreography, stage design, acting are all fantastic. There were some really impressive scenes to look at which are more powerful than a modern action movie could do. \n The downside is that I did feel the extent of stereotype on Vietnamese/Communist characters is a bit glaring. I can understand it was written by French men during the cold war so we shouldn't be too harsh. I'm wondering how everyone here thinks about it.\n    submitted by    /u/Awkward_Number8249  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was reading a book recently that claimed Pol Pot planned to invade South Vietnam, and essentially try to take Saigon before the North Vietnamese forces arrived and restore the Mekong to Cambodia, which nationalists there historically claim. It didn't happen because of how unexpectedly quickly the RVN forces fell to the North, although Cambodian forces did briefly take Phu Quoc after the fall of Saigon before being expelled. And then ultimately crushed in 1978 when the battle-hardened Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia. \n It got me thinking about what would have happened if he had invaded the much weaker South Vietnam, assuming it hadn't collapsed so quickly. Could he have pushed through to Saigon? Would China, who preferred to have Vietnam divided, have provided more support?

One thing I noticed, particularly in shops, cafes and restaurants is that while in the other countries (even hyper expensive Singapore), buildings were usually an arctic blast the moment you walk in, a lot of places in Vietnam often only have 1 AC unit running, AC set to a high temperature or areas of the premises partitioned off for \"cleaning\".\n I also noticed they usually just open the windows in the morning in spite of the noise, heat and pollution, waiting till the heat was unbearable before finally shutting the windows and turning the AC on and would sometimes turn off the AC 30 minutes or more before closing time. Is it really that expensive to run AC in Vietnam? . .

          "description": "Hello! When my Uncle served for the US Army in Vietman, he was stationed in Nha Trang. His experience was far different than so many other veterans - he had a pretty good life while he was there and has been back to visit, in fact. He managed to get into a relationship with a local woman named Diep (out of respect I am not posting her full name) which he still reminisces of fondly to this day. He yearns to know that she is okay.\n Pics: https://imgur.com/shBetbb https://imgur.com/QinNwTP \n This is a shot in the dark but I wanted to at least let my Uncle know that I shared his story. I also realize that she and many others may have had a completely different perspective of things. Apologies ahead of time but this is about their relationship, nothing else. He is getting very old and this is one of the last things that he's never gotten closure on. If you know or knew this woman, enjoy the pictures. If you wish to share anything about her, please do. I'll share them with him.\n Thank you. Be well.\n    submitted by    /u/rockin_the_boat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Today, lying contemplatively, I suddenly sat and pondered about charity. I looked at it from a different perspective.\n If there were no charity missions, would the children there not know about the existence of better food, nicer clothes? Most people know that charity is often organized with groups going to remote areas for a few days, cooking, providing clothes, books, and supplies, and then everyone goes back home.\n The children/people in those areas get to eat 'okay' for a few meals, and then it goes back to reality as usual. So, does charity bring any meaning to the people there? Or is it a way for the children to see themselves as 'poor' compared to society? So, if there were no charity, or if they didn't go on social media to see others 'flexing', would their lives be less self-conscious?\n    submitted by    /u/TomFrontend  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, we're planning of travelling to Hanoi in December and doing an excursion to Hạ Long Bay area. We can plan to either do a 2 day 1 night cruise but typically these finish at midday and then travel back to Hanoi. Does anyone have any recommendations for trips that are 2 day 1 night but only travel back to Hanoi around 4/5 pm so make the most of the 2nd day? We are unable to do a 3 day 2 night trip as our flight is very early on the 3rd day.\n Alternatively does anyone know what cruises we can do that drop off at Cat Ba island on the 2nd day and we do our own thing before heading back to Hanoi? I believe the last boat/bus back is at 4pm, but please tell me if there are other later options for returning to Hanoi.\n Any any recommendations on if to do Lan Ha Bay/Cat ba island instead of Hạ Long Bay?\n    submitted by    /u/Public-Scheme5271  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mới gần đây, bạn ấy có đăng một vài video trong đó bạn nói tiếng Việt có bị chậm. Không biết là ai ném đá trước nhưng sau một thời gian thì có nhiều Tiktoker khác bu vào chửi bới và khinh bỉ rằng OOP giả bộ không biết Tiếng Việt để tỏ vẻ Mỹ Trắng.\n Lúc đầu thì mình cũng ngỡ ngàng tại vì mình sống nước ngoài cũng khá lâu. Mình chưa bao giờ tiếp xúc với người Việt gốc nào giả bộ nói lớ tiếng Việt để “làm màu”. Những comments mình đọc được thì cũng nhiều thành phần nói thẳng ra là vô cùng vô văn hoá và thiếu suy nghĩ. Bao nhiêu người, già hay trẻ, xô vào để cấu xé cô gái có 22-24 tuổi làm vài video giải trí trên mạng. Rồi nhiều Tiktoker còn tự chế thông tin kêu là bạn này mới qua được một năm, bạn này bắt chước hoa hậu nào đó cũng bị lớ giọng sau khi học nhiều thứ tiếng. Thật sự là mình hơi ngạc nhiên khi thấy tình trạng bóc phốt bây giờ nhỏ nhặt đến mức chỉ nói lớ tiếng Việt là ăn chửi. Liệu Tiktok VN bây giờ có thô thiển quá mà chỉ toàn “The Drama”, kiếm nạn nhân để mà chửi câu view hay không? \n    submitted by    /u/poorboy2022  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's obviously very little tourism there especially westerners so at least 1/3 of people say hello or ask questions, kids come running to me etc but mostly positive encounters.\n Of course some laugh at me because I'm a 185cm dude on some tiny multicolor bicycle I got from my hotel roaming the dirt roads but I don't mind.\n But today I was cycling at this spot https://maps.app.goo.gl/WJqaow9SXyUgEGic9 and a young guy around 16yo on a scooter stopped me in the middle of the road and was quite angry for some reason. Couldn't speak a word of english and I can't speak vietnamese. He left after maybe 2 minutes so I kept going the same way (down south to get to a creek) and he turned back, turned again and was behind me and gave me a kick with his foot in the back of my bicycle.\n I realised he certainly didn't want me to go that way for some reason so I turned back and I didn't see him again.\n Any idea what happened there ?

          "description": "Wow what can I say, it's been 18 years since I've been here, I came here when I was 12 and when bird flu was an issue. It's so incredibly different, for context, I'm Vietnamese Australian and being here made me fall in love with the life here, although maybe that's idealistic but living in a western society for so long made me realise how deeply problematic the social system and dynamic are, it might work for some and it might not work for others but I love it here, btw this is my first solo trip and well... So far here's my experience, the ho Chi Minh song from vietjetair is stuck in my head, I feel a deep sense of pride for him even though I wasn't born here,I oddly comfortable here, I ate Banh mi Huynh hoa, I spoke to the locals, I got scammed but hey it's all experienced so I'm not mad, just a little disappointed but hey it's life. People are helpful, willing to help.\n So I guess this probably a very adventurous start, and a big welcome to Vietnam. Wow, that's day 1 anyway till I post again, next flight Hanoi !\n If there is anything fun to do and awesome food/drink to try, please let me know ! \n    submitted by    /u/deeragunz_11  \n [link]   [comments]",

We enjoy nature and calm but also maybe a place with a couple bars where we can meet people and also some nice cultural events. We were thinking somewhere north and we are not sure if we are going to stay very long in the south because of the hot weather. ( We like the cold!) Eventhough our flight back home will be leaving from Ho Chi Minh City. We are in Hanoï right now and we are craving for a place much less busy and quieter (we have been in cities for the past 3 weeks). It can also be in center Vietnam, we were thinking of being there at the end of December / beginning of January.

I just found the 30M information on the recruiter's profile.\n Thanks to you, from my understanding it may be great for a local but not for an expat.

I ran across the work of Mark Alves, a linguist who basically reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of Vietic language. And I started to realise how Vietnamese really kinda stands on its own as being a SouthEastern and East Asian language. I don’t why but this was my shower thought about why there is so much Chinese built within Vietnamese language.\n I noticed in his work there was a lot of old Chinese (and of course other dialects and Chinese words over history) still used in Vietnamese. I had a weird shower thought that Vietnamese language seems like a sponge for Chinese language, if they didn’t have an existing word for it they just take it from their big neighbours. And I think hearing from my family about colonialism isn’t the whole story why there’s so many words adopted.

          "description": "I caught the night train down from Hanoi last night. We hit massive flooding just outside Hue (Quang Tri) and stopped at 7am. \n We haven’t moved since. We can’t get off the train, and we’re not being given any information by the staff, or the tourism company the train service is with. There’s not much food or water, and the staff are hiding from us. \n I’m starting to get quite worried and stressed. Does anyone know when the floods will recede? Or could we be stuck here on the train until the weekend or longer? We’re scared we will run out of food and water and power soon. We definitely won’t move until morning now. \n We would get off and try to find a car to take us back north, but it’s dark and too risky, we don’t know the situation out there. \n Please stay safe everyone in the region!\n Edit: woke up. We’ve still not moved. We’ve been on the train for 36 hours+ now. It’s still raining heavily. My boyfriend is starting to get sick and is coughing with no water. We’re starting to get very sad and scared. We haven’t seen any staff members for 10+ hours. We’re not at a station so can’t get off. We’re on a ‘tourist carriage’ so no Vietnamese to ask for help. We’re ‘safe’ physically from the rain, and I’m grateful for that, but I’m so fed up of not knowing. At this point, we just want to fly back home from what was meant to be our dream trip. I feel so, so guilty for suggesting we take the train 😭 \n Edit 2: staff has abandoned us. We cannot find them. We have had news and no supplies for 12+ hours. Everyone is leaving the train and trying to escape now. We know it’s not safe, but we will also risk leaving now while it’s still light and the rain has stopped for a while. We will try to get to Dong Ha, then go north. \n    submitted by    /u/UnemployedInCPH  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are staying near the Bui Vien street and this is no hate towards tourists like we are, but it's also nice to experience the 'real nightlife' like the locals experience it. \n All three of us are happily in a relationship right now, so it's not about 'hunting' girls. It's all about having a good time in a bar or club. Something different than Bui Vien (or something located on Bui Vien but not really tourist-heavy).

It’s supposed to be the combined limit for the carry-on and the personal item, but both are usually over this limit. Any carry-on under 7kg would be mostly empty. \n I don’t care if an airline wants to make more money and charge more. They can certainly do so, but they should have reasonable rules and clear prices.\n I just had a bad experience checking in to a VietJet flight where the employe made me empty my carry-on and put half of the things in my big bag and half in my backpack. They checked in my big bag which was now slightly over the 20kg limit and my almost empty carry-on. They kept telling me to make my backpack lighter, but it was that heavy because of my laptop, iPad and battery pack which can’t be checked in because they contain lithium batteries.

          "description": "👋 hello. American looking for authentic cha gio here in the states. Specifically, many Vietnamese restaurants use egg-based (yellow) roll wrap paper and not the clear, white rice paper. I was always told that the yellow one was the Chinese way of making them, and that proper cha gio were made with the clear ones. (Is this true?) Personally, I prefer the clear white wraps 100% of the time. I’m disappointed when I order cha gio in a restaurant and I get the yellow kind. Does anyone know how I can ask what kind of paper they use and what answer reflects my preferences? Will a Vietnamese restaurant look at me sideways for even asking?\n Thanks!\n Background: American, but my (White) grandmother was born and raised in Vietnam. Our family has since adopted some Vietnamese dishes as part of our family culinary traditions, including thit koh, bun thit, and cha gio. Looking to maintain those family traditions in the way I was taught. 😊\n    submitted by    /u/BasicWasabi  \n [link]   [comments]",

There were about 30 of us, and although we can’t see a thing, we have excellent hearing and some of us speak English.\n So we were seated around various tables and we heard this foreign guy seeming to have a great time with his female friends. There were all just chatting and we figured out that he was gay and they were out having a “ladies day” of sorts. He was joking around with them and gossiping like one of the girls. He kept saying stuff like “no betch” and “that’s right girl, he ain’t all that”.\n Then we heard the sound of another foreigner and he also sounded effeminate. He seemed to be trying to flirt with the first guy. The first guy suddenly pretended to be all macho and changed his voice. We were like bruh.\n We heard what sounded like hands grabbing plump body parts and we heard some kissing. Then the other gay guy got even madder and was saying stuff like “you know you don’t like them, you big faker” and then we heard footsteps storming off.\n So we all just chuckled and went on with our meal.

I was balling out with these 45 kilogram chicken and they were loving it. Then all the sudden this crazy tourist comes over trying to be a hero and tell me to take my hands off the product. I ignored him as I paid for these women, so I kissed them. He said something again about me touching the woman. So I grabbed the women again to piss him off and kissed them as well. The guy looked miserable. Like he had come to vacation with his wife and mother in law. He was jealous as I left my wife and mother in law at home. Why would you bring that kind of sand to the beach? There is plenty of sand here to play with. Any how, the women were having fun and enjoying my company. These tourist should mind their business just like I was. We are some hard working men from Malaysia here for some R&R. These type of tourist confuse me. Are they here to vacation and have fun or play some fantasy superhero?

          "description": "Just a fun story I wanted to share, no offense to anyone who digs the style I‘m going to talk about.\n My dad migrated from Vietnam 30 years ago and what striked me almost my whole adolescent life was his particular style of clothing. Like everything has a luxury brand name on it. All in all it it’s this kind of „young money“ street style from 2010. Sunglasses, caps, LV satchel, expensive watch, you name it, paired with buddhist accessories. From a fashion standpoint it’s completely randomly combined. This stands out even more since no other 60 year old man dresses this way in the country I grew up in. Though I’d say especially migrant groups tend to do that as well as a status symbol though there‘s something, besides the jade bracelets and stuff, that makes it so different and I really can‘t say what.\n And then, in 2019, I visited Vietnam for my first time. And when I walked around Bui Vien street or took the local busses, I’ve seen other middle aged men that radiated some thuggish ominous vibe like bouncers and I realized They wear the same outfits!! I don‘t know what exactly made it so similar but the composition of their outfits reminded me immediately of my dad. I had the feeling they wore even more accessories like a watch but also a jade bracelet and a wooden pearl bracelet on the same arm. It‘s so weird hahaha but now I know, where he got that inspiration from\n    submitted by    /u/eggisch  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would it be rude for me to bring her some? Unopened obviously. I feel like it may come across as rude or making fun of her and that is NOT my intention. I'm posting this here because I'm unaware of the nuances in Vietnamese culture surrounding gift giving and such. The last thing I want to do is offend her.\n    submitted by    /u/suckmyarsee  \n [link]   [comments]",
