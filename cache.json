          "description": "Not a Karen post! I just wonder if anyone else noticed something similar. \n I’ve traveled between HCM and Hanoi a lot this summer and have never had any problems with the food, however yesterday was awful at multiple places. I wonder if there is some airport-wide issue that’s happened recently or if yesterday was just a lot of bad luck. \n Many VN airports have a Lucky Star Cafe and I usually get a sandwich from there. They have the sandwiches on display in a window and you pick one, they take it out and heat it, and hand it over. At Hanoi airport yesterday, I looked at one cafe and all the meat looked super dried out, as if it had been sitting at room temp for hours, or even more than a day. All the meat on all the sandwiches looked like that. I decided to try another location of Lucky Star — same thing: dry, discolored looking meat. I decided to order Burger King instead because it was right next to me and because at least that food is cooked when you order it. \n The BK fried chicken sandwich was utter shite! It looked like it had been fried at too high of a temperature for not a long time. It looked like a burned brick on the outside and the inside was cold mush. I had to spit it out as soon as I took a bite and I just left. I didn’t even want to try anything else. I am aware I should not have high quality expectations for fast food but it should at least be edible. \n I got a bottle of water from a third Lucky Star location and all the sandwiches there looked the same as the first two. I just decided not to try anything else at the airport. \n I know this could be a huge coincidence, but maybe there is a wider issue? Is there some electricity issue fucking with the food equipment? Has there been so little traffic that they haven’t moved their products? This is the only time I’ve had bad food at the airport so it just seemed weird that four different places had food issues. What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/Lamourtattend  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only way for her to receive citizenship in Japan is to work for 3+ years as an office lady and pay the government X amount of taxes. \n We aren't doing that, and recently I received a job in VN.\n Because she doesn't have a passport or citizenship anywhere in the world, her visa status will likely be a little difficult to navigate (she has a special visa that allows her to visit Vietnam for 6 month periods but requires her to return to Japan). \n Has anyone here been in a similar situation? \n She knows that she won't apply for Japanese citizenship (and has little desire to now).

There was one bad thing however today, as I couldn't find my driver license anywhere. Which baffles me because I always have it on me in the same card holder. But yeah it's gone and that is a real bummer because I was looking forward to renting a scooter or motor to drive around the area. I found a travel blog on the internet however saying that to rent a 50cc scooter you don't necesarilly need to show/have a license. The last time I rented one of those in Indonesia it was able to go up to 80 km/hour so that is fine for my needs. So I wanted to check here. Do you have an idea if it is possible to do this without a license?

          "description": "I'm an English 27 y/o female living in London. I have a 1st class Fine Art degree and currently studying a PGCE in secondary art and design (post graduate that qualifies me to teach full British GCSE art and design curriculum and A-level). I have teaching experience in art and geography. I recently started a beginners Vietnamese course with SOAS. \n I was preparing to move to Vietnam to teach English and COVID hit, which pressed me to study my post grad and become an art teacher.\n I want to live the rest of my 20s and onwards in a beautiful exciting country, to immerse myself in a new culture, learn a new language, to grow and truly live. I want to really take some time to move to a country to study to make my best attempt at learning the language, meeting new people and also to rent a studio to have the time to develop my art practice. \n Here in UK I'm seasonally depressed 6 months of the year, overworked to afford to get by and uninspired and to be honest I've always felt this way about life here. \n The reason I chose to study to become an art teacher is in some desperate hope that I might be able to utilise these skills and find work in an international school abroad as a British curriculum art teacher or gain a residency visa back to Australia (closer to Vietnam at least). Don't get me wrong I do love working with young people.\n Working as an art teacher in London is something like £35k a year. But honestly I'd take a sickening pay cut to move and have more time to truly live. International schools in vn seem few and far between that need art teachers. I would obviously very much love to keep progressing with my art related career, as it's my specialism and love but I would consider teaching English if It means I have more time off and have enough money to work on my art and take Vietnamese lessons. \n Thoughts anyone? What kinds of jobs/hours/pay What do you think my prospects will look like if I move to Vietnam. 🇻🇳🍵\n    submitted by    /u/onomebunbun  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am doing it all online through a university that is outside of Vietnam. 2021 I got an online job that allowed me to get through covid times. My employment contract there ends at the end of January 2023.\n Having worked from home for the last two years, my Vietnamese skills have diminished a lot, and they weren't that good to begin with. \n I have a year until my university degree is finished and I then plan to reenter the workforce, but until then, I have two options: return to my extremely expensive home country where I will need to finish my studies and work at the same time, due to cost of living OR continue my online studies here while also studying Vietnamese.\n My online studies are in a field that I am already quite knowledgeable in, so I am kind of bored to be honest. And on top of that, I have a lot of free time. So I would much prefer to stay here and study Vietnamese and live off of the savings for a year before returning to work.\n The last point to add, my fiancée (also a foreign national) and I are getting married, so I could return once that paperwork is finished but her countries government makes that of Vietnam look like a well oiled machine, so I don't want to rely on that. \n TLDR: I have a year off and would prefer to stay in Vietnam to study than go home to my home country.

The dog also licked my leg (no visible open wounds, but I had shaved that morning so you never know).\n Do I need to get post exposure rabies shots, or am I being paranoid? Sorry in advance if this is incredibly stupid. I lived a part of my childhood in India, where rabies is a big deal.\n    submitted by    /u/alym427  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am coming in to DN first.\n However, I just noticed that it is the rainy season & i didn't expect Hoi An/DN/Hue to be flooded that badly. As you can see my past post history, others have mentioned that the flood generally come and go quickly and 99% of the cities/ tourist spot are still accessible.\n After seeing the news on DN/Hue ytd and today, I am even more worried and really need some advice here from the viet community. (I have done my research online and reddits alrdy to prevent overposting, but i really need some assurance and guidance. Hope my post doesnt get removed).\n ​\n Q1) How true is it that the flood doesnt impact 99% of the cities and tourist spot are generally accessible?\n Q2) If it rains heavily, How long does the flood takes to recede so that I can travel off?\n Usually, Are the railway trains station still accessible during floods?\n Q3) Even tho, it is hard to predict the likelyhood of floods, & I can still visit the 7-14days weather forecast. But if the city (DN/Hoi An/ Hue) has already flooded before, and the typhoon/storm heads somewhere else, are they still prone to flooding?\n Q4) Aside from weather forecast, what can i search on to warn myself of upcoming flood?\n Q4) Are the northern Vietnam safe from flooding? So i can change my plans?\n ​\n This is my first 20+ days trip to vietnam, and i really didn't foresee this coming. Appreciate many help\n    submitted by    /u/chammpionn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yes it got slightly out of hand and my budget grew.\n I work remotely and I’ve decided to try living in Vietnam longer term. I have a 5 year visa and I need to exit the country every 6 months which is fine because visit family and friends back home. \n  \n I am figuring out the right visa for me… Even though I can stay in the country for 6 months on a tourist visa. But I’m confused? \n  \nI want to rent a high rise serviced apartment with 2 rooms close to the center. Is US$600 per month enough? \n I don’t plan to party and drink (as much as I did last trip) and I’m more focused on really understanding the motherland. I want it to be more meaningful and I create real, lasting friendships. \n So I plan to budget US$500-800 for spending money for everything I need per month.\n I’m extremely interested in investing and entrepreneurship here in Vietnam. So I’d like to start a business here. \n I leave in December again. I’m getting travel insurance etc. visa, passport and everything renewed. \n Any tips are welcome!

          "description": "I see many myths perpetuated both here and in daily life. This happens with all languages (see endless arguments on YouTube about Tamil/Sanskrit/Chinese being 'the oldest language', a nonsensical notion).\n Some typical myths:\n - Vietnamese grammar is 'backwards' compared to English/other language of choice (or just difficult in general)\n - Vietnamese has many words/syllables/etc. with different meanings (making it difficult)\n - The Vietnamese writing system is difficult and 'needs' to be reformed\n Just off the top of my head, I have seen and heard these three very recently. If I sat down and thought/researched I could list many more.\n The problem is that none of these claims mean anything in isolation. Many words with different meanings---compared to what language? Difficult writing system---compared to what other writing systems? And where's the evidence? There is never or very rarely any evidence or standards of comparison given. As a linguist I could go into detail on these issues, but I'd rather see what other people have to say first.\n Now flame me and tell me why I'm wrong.\n    submitted by    /u/legatrixx  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there any way to get out of this since I'm a dual citizen or would I have to leave the country ASAP, I did enter on my Vietnamese Passport.

I assume the Vietnamese spouse has to earn a certain amount of income to sponsor the American spouse. \n Any advices and personal experiences are greatly appreciate!

          "description": "Would love to know what are thoughts from different age groups of Vietnam locals about developing advanced economy, despite all the problems mentioned in different industry articles.\n My core part at work is a radical shift in commerce / production & supply chains with innovating incentives for companies, employees and end customers / consumers that adopts to clean tech driven supply chains; be it food, healthcare, renewables, electronics, FMCG, sales through new B2B, B2C channels, services, EVs etc.\n I personally love the creative designs from Vietnam that uses natural biofibers (bamboo, hyacinth etc.) & overall designs. They are at par with details from Japanese, Chinese, Thailand's creative arts - a mix of tradition, nature & modern.\n I also got surprised by recent developments & announcements by Vingroup EV making in US for US customers. & at the same time, I wonder why MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) of Vietnam are not gearing up faster at global stage. \n For example, I never see them at industrial trade shows of the West (US, EU) or even at the East (digital or physical attendance), even though products are pretty good & innovative. Lets say Amazon SEA summit in Singapore, there are zero Vietnamese companies / MSMEs.\n Few of them are on Alibaba, but finding other MSMEs is hard as Alibaba is not that connected with new development outside of China, and the restrictions etc. makes it more complicated. \n Also, few good points from my research are repeated in this article: on Vietnam + ASEAN region since most of our suppliers at work are looking at ASEAN countries for shifting their production from China.\n https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/Vietnam-s-battle-to-climb-the-global-value-chain\n    submitted by    /u/starlord_west  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am sure that this type of question is posted and reposted multiple times around this time of year, so I apologize if I am being redundant. I searched Tet in the sub history and did not see many things regarding the questions I have.\n Firstly, my girlfriend and I are interested in traveling to Vietnam during Tet as it seems like a joyous way to celebrate the new year. Here in the US there are group activities such as bars to go to and fire work shows. We looked at cities and dates, and have thought about spending the month of January from beginning to end in Hoi An.\n I understand we may be behaving as ignorant Americans, thinking that everything will be open or that there will be mass celebrations. But we really just want to experience the culture. Is it possible -post Covid- to do this somewhere in Vietnam? Neither of us wish to be disrespectful to your country. We are realistic travelers, we know to go with the flow and are ok with buying food to make our own meals. We do NOT expect to be catered to or waited on. We want to enjoy your beautiful culture.\n Is Hoi An truly a good city for this type of thing, or should we go to Ho Chi Minh city?\n If it is possible to join a city in celebration of Tet, how should we go about this while being respectful?\n Thank you for taking the time to read this, I wish you the best.\n ​\n EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. I see I did misunderstand the nature of Tet. It seems it would be better for my girlfriend and I to visit during a different time year. I appreciate you all. We will look for somewhere else to visit.\n    submitted by    /u/That_one_Gguy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not of Vietnamese descent, but a character in a story I'm working on is and I want to get this right!\n She is first-generation Vietnamese American, so she will go by an English (Christian) name throughout the story, but she still needs a Vietnamese given name and family name. \n The English name I'd want to give to her is Trinity -- so \"Trinh\" would be perfect, but I'm not sure if that'd sound weird if used as a first name. Any other ideas? I'm not super committed to \"Trinity,\" but I'd like there to be some connection between her given name and English name.\n I also need a family name. I know \"Nguyen\" is the stereotypical one, but if you were reading a book with a Vietnamese main character, what other names would sound normal and natural to you?\n    submitted by    /u/stressedoutcyborg  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm planning to visit the country south to north (mostly focusing on the north) , and I'd like to stay in Vietnam for 25 days (I'll dedicate either 4-5 days to Cambodia, just checking out to the capital and Angkor Wat). Is that enough or too much time? My main interest are nature, and history. I don't really care about hitting the beach, and partying is okay but not like a must. My itinerary is Ho chi Minh - flight to Hoi an - Hue - Phong Nha - Tom Coc (ninh binh) - Hanoi - cruise to Ha long Bay - Ha Giang Loop . Is there anything that i'm missing?\n I'm planning to be there at the end of February, March (i'll definitely be in the north during march). Is that a good time to visit? Can I book everything once I'm already there such as accommodation/flights to have some extra flexibility, or is it high season and I'd probably book everything ahead to avoid shitty hostels and expensive flights?\n Should I bother going to Sapa or is it too cold/foggy in March, and not worth it?\n How is it safety wise? Are night buses safe, do they drop you in the middle of nowhere or you can ask them to drop you close to your accommodation? I'm not thrilled about potentially walking alone at night with a huge backpack. Can you as tourist (i'm a skinny white girl there is no way I'll pass for a Vietnamese) walk safely at night alone ? Is taking taxis/tuk tuk alone at night safe (i've lived in south america, heard way too many horror stories)?\n Thanks for all the help :)\n    submitted by    /u/bi_shyreadytocry  \n [link]   [comments]",

I came across the Chut ethnic group located in eastern Laos and in Quang Binh province and I’ve have been trying to find information on their religious beliefs and specific cultural idiosyncrasies that separate them from or align them with other ethnic practices in Vietnam. I suppose I am more trying to find out more about their “religious” practices, primarily relating to death and funeral processions. I can’t find anything. \n Do they practice a generally “animist” belief system pertaining to the afterlife, spirits, etc? I know commonly in animist belief structure, there is this idea of the wandering soul, in that unnatural or untimely or violent death can result in malevolent spirits that cause turmoil for those around. Is this pertinent among any of the 5 subgroups (ruc, May, etc) under the Chut umbrella? \n Thanks for any input\n    submitted by    /u/michizzard  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apparently there is a ceremony, I have been led to believe two monks will be there (what do the monks do?) that the bride and groom will then leave to take photos in a different location, then come back for the reception. \n I’ve been told by a different friend who currently lives in Saigon that Vietnamese weddings aren’t too long, and there’s often karaoke involved. \n Any information that will help my friends and I not be totally blindsided or make any cultural faux pas would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/EmMeo  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are left to rot as eyesores all over the country. Unfinished construction sides and rubbish everywhere. You can see this in Saigon, Hoi An, Dong Nai, Mui Ne, many places. And its too late to reverse it, the environment is already destroyed. They stay there to rot for a decade or more sometimes.\n Illegal developments, most likely with crooked local govt involvement. Example: https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/phu-quoc-to-raze-79-illegal-villas-4518959.html . And once again, the environment is totally destroyed already, cant get it back.\n Developments run by competent organisations, but way too much public land is granted to them. One example - Novaworld Phan Thiet was granted almost an entire 1km of public beach front land just for them. Likewise, big sections of Phu Quoc, Nha Trang, Quy Nhon and others have had the environment totally wiped out for all manner of empty resorts.

Nhưng từ khi bên này chạy chương trình khuyến mãi thì xảy ra rất nhiều chuyện như: giày giặt cả tháng cũng chưa có, không hề gọi điện thoại báo, để khách đi đi lại lại nhiều lần, đôi khi nổi điên thì mới sắp xếp trả giày. Mà trả giày còn ẩm ướt mới tức.\n Một lần giặt đôi thể thao trắng (mới mang được 1 lần), giày giặt hơn cả tháng mới có, xong 2 ngày sau lấy ra thì giày mốc đen toàn bộ đôi giày. Mình mang lại thì nói xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại, hẹn mình 2 tuần sau quay lại trả giày. Khi nhận lại gì một số vết ố mốc đen giặt không ra, mình có hỏi thì nhận được câu trả lời “xin lỗi” là xong. Tức cầm giày về thế là bỏ luôn đôi giày.\n Hôm nay bị một cú quá đau, cách đây hơn 1 tháng mình có gửi giặt 3 đôi giày. Mình nhờ em mình ghé lấy giày dùm, em mình chỉ kiểm tra 1 đôi thì thấy đôi trắng bị mốc đen, cũng bài cũ xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại. Em mình cầm 2 đôi còn lại về mà ko kiểm. Tối mình đi làm về mở ra xem thì muốn chết đứng luôn ạ, toàn bộ da bị co cứng, teo lại và bị chết, đế lót cong veo,...mang ko còn vừa. Mình nhắn facebook không phản hồi. Là đôi mình rất thích kiếm mãi mới có, nên giữ rất cẩn thận, mỗi lần mang ai cũng khen đẹp. Lúc mang đến thì còn đẹp, nhận lại thì eo ôi không còn nhận ra hình hài của em nó...\n Thực sự quá tệ từ dịch vụ cho đến chất lượng :((\n    submitted by    /u/nguyenminhthu123  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was born in Canada so my idea was that we would contribute equal percentage from our income for our shared expenses, and we handle the rest ourselves (to each their own money) - however she's not happy with it. She thinks that since I make more, I should contribute more than her since I will have a lot more money left. Is this the norm for a Viet girl? House chores we share 50/50 (I'd often do more because I want to) and everything else is equal but she won't budge about this part.\n Everyone is completely misunderstanding my point. We aren't doing the 50/50 split. I pay over 70% of everything. What I suggested was we both put half of our income into a shared account from which we would pay for our expenses. The idea of each of us having separate money to handle for ourselves was from her. The point here is that she thinks I should put more than half my money and she less so, so that what's left to each of us is more or less equal. She also wants to keep her job and not have children for at least another 7-8 years.\n    submitted by    /u/ZenDaFout  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I lost the language when I was very young and can't ask my father for help as I want it to be a surprise! I was hoping someone could help me with an accurate translation, it would mean the world. The phrase is simple but I don't want to leave it to a translating program:\n \"Always remember who you are\"\n This phrase holds a deep personal meaning associated with my father and I. However, the exact wording or translation can be flexible depending on what translates the best. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

He is from Hanoi and I really want to learn vietnamese with the nothern accent but all apps seem to be in the southern accent, which is way different than what he speaks. I already learned a lot about his culture, and we often find a lot of similarities. He is very interested in mine and I want to show him how important he is to me as well! Thank you all🌸\n EDIT: I seemed to have open a big discussion 😭 I said/made this post because whenever I learn with my boyfriend, or try to practice myself I send him the things, thats when he tells me that they don't say it that way/ use different words or that the pronounciation is more southerly than northern. I don't ever want to offend anyone. I just want to be able to communicate with his mom!💗 thanks for the great advice!\n    submitted by    /u/pinkmountain1  \n [link]   [comments]",
