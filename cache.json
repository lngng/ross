          "description": "So I have lived in Ha Noi for 5 years and I have visited Saigon many times but I have always been interested in why Saigon doesn't seem to have an architetural equivalent to the Hoan Kiem and Ba Dinh in Ha Noi(even parts of Ha Dong old town in fact)\n The thing that gets me is that Saigon always had more french influence then Ha Noi. It was directly governed by Paris as opposed to the rest of Vietnam which was under harsher colonial rule. It was the center of french colonial life in Indochina with the French having their tennis clubs and Rugby teams.\n Yet I haven't seen as many old french mansions(of course there are lots of old government buildings but less so then Ha Noi)\n    submitted by    /u/BornChef3439  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything from the food to the people are top notch.

I haven't travelled the world much, but I've been to the Middle East, Singapore, and Germany, and none of them compare. Being here is a cultural shock in a good way.\n I know this post is vague, but I just wanted to say thank you so much wherever I could and to whomever I could, hence me doing so here.

          "description": "I live in Vietnam. I went back home and when I came back to Vietnam I brought some souvenirs and gifts. Nothing special. I was brought up \"minimalist\". I never bought fancy gifts for my partners, friends, and family. So, why would I do that to people who are, well, at the periphery of my friendzone?\n And all in all: Isn't it the thought that counts?\n Anyhow, my gifts received some harsh comments. For instance, a Vietnamese friend got some brand clothes from Europe. I bought some toys for his younger brother. Do you know Playmobil? A bit like Lego. I confess, the two toys (a Wild-west Fort and a Pirate ship) were on discount. But they cost about 100$. That is more than I gave to my bf for Christmas, LOL. Anyhow, I can survive that a 10yo doesn't say thankyou and is happy. But my friend said, that his brother was disappointed because he wanted some more \"valuable\".\n I am not on a paylevel which enables me to throw around with MacBooks and Iphones. I do not have such devices neither.\n Another time I was invited and I bought a 25$ red wine bottle. In my home country Germany that would already be too much. Most guests will spend about 10-15$. No one really awaits a 1,000$-bottle of Rothschild stuff.\n Anyhow, the host was quite rude. During the evening he showed my bottle, made a gesture like vomitting and put it aside. Then he presented a fancy Whiskey bottle and told everyone that the bottle was about 200$. This person was not even close to me, so why would I pay 200$ for some alcohol? I am in general a generous guy, but these two examples (there are quite more in my experience) are really too much. I understand, I am the \"rich\" foreigner. But they cannot really await that I come of dozens of Iphones, cars, laptops? I feel really sad, since my personal life is not circling around consumption.\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_Kha  \n [link]   [comments]",

A friend and I are going to be in Hanoi for 10 days in July, and we were planning on spending 5 days in Hanoi, a day trip to Ninh Binh and the last 3 nights in Ha Long Bay, but we've been seeing threads on how Ha Long is deserted and there's no point in staying the night there.\n Can someone please provide some clarity on whether this is true and too much time in Ha Long? Taking an overnight cruise is a little outside our budget so we're not keen on that, especially given that one of us is prone to seasickness. Would it be better to spend a couple of days elsewhere in the north? If yes, where should we be going?\n    submitted by    /u/Junior_Assistance171  \n [link]   [comments]",

Told me he has family in Australia and telling me all about them. Asked if I'd like to get a drink with him, which I was happy to do!\n Spent some time drinking with him, during which time he told me his family were visiting and they were having a big party. When it was time to go, he asked if I'd buy a bottle of wine for their party, which I agreed to do. He took me about a 10min ride away to a shop to buy wine, which cost 900,000 dong and then took me back to where we met. I realised at the time the wine was very expensive but I was a little drunk and didn't know where I was exactly so I didn't protest. I assume he just takes the wine back and splits the profits with the shop! \n While we were drinking he took my email, I assume he'll try and have me send money for something else, but should I watch out for anything else? \n Thanks for any advice!\n    submitted by    /u/bonjarden  \n [link]   [comments]",

He came here to work to support his elderly parents who need high cost medical treatment and dietary supplements that are not readily available in Venezuela.

Both post the same content and are owned by the same person. Please do not view their videos as it will gain popularity that way.

          "description": "I think for the most part, people in Vietnam are quite laidback and friendly. Why does it change so much when people are driving? A large number of people just turn into selfish assholes as soon as they're in control of a vehicle. Car drivers seem to consider the possibility of slowing down or giving way an insult to their ego. Bike drivers pay little attention to any kind of rules unless they're being watched by police. They'll drive the wrong way, break red lights, use sidewalks, pay zero attention to other traffic and refuse to stop at junctions. Buses and trucks only seem to have an accelerator and a horn. Everybody seems to be in a massive rush to get somewhere, yet when they arrive they just nonchalantly wander around like NPCs. \n What's actually going on? I'm aware it's not everyone and you see plenty of people patiently waiting in traffic while those around them mount the sidewalk, but the sheer number of people that act like assholes on the road is way higher than in other countries. I don't think it just infrastructure because it happens even when the infrastructure is good. I also see people blame lack of education or poor people from the countryside, but you can cross the border into Laos and it's totally different experience\n    submitted by    /u/AnJa1407  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I noticed that the tones of Ti·∫øng Hu·∫ø sound vastly different from the first two: d·∫•u s·∫Øc is lower rather than higher and sounds more like d·∫•u h·ªèi, and d·∫•u huy·ªÅn is higher instead of slightly lower, but not as high as a typical d·∫•u s·∫Øc. A few days ago I asked a Chinese friend what the four tones in Chinese sounded like, and I realized that they sounded very similar to Ti·∫øng Hu·∫ø‚Äôs tones. D·∫•u huy·ªÅn of Ti·∫øng Hu·∫ø sounds like the falling tone of Chinese and d·∫•u s·∫Øc sounds like the rising tone. I can‚Äôt speak for whether d·∫•u h·ªèi/ng√£ sounds like the down-up tone, as I do not know what h·ªèi/ng√£ sounds like in Ti·∫øng Hu·∫ø. Why do Ti·∫øng Hu·∫ø‚Äôs tones sound similar to the Chinese tones? I‚Äôm guessing because Hu·∫ø was the old capital of Vi·ªát Nam, most likely where most of the nobles/elites resided. Being a noble probably meant you probably had be able to speak in Mandarin and write in Ch·ªØ H√°n/Nom, which likely had an influence on how they spoke Vietnamese.

          "description": "The news that Vietnam will have 70 Michelin Guide honored restaurants in 2023 is encouraging and long overdue. Vietnam's unique culinary traditions, blending multiple regional styles with influences from China and France, produce some of the world's most iconic and delicious dishes.\n From pho to banh mi, spring rolls to imperial court cuisine, Vietnamese food withstands comparison with the finest culinary traditions anywhere. The creativity, skill and passion of Vietnamese chefs across the country have produced cooking that has long deserved global renown.\n Having 70 Michelin-reviewed establishments will help showcase the diversity and quality of Vietnam's dynamic restaurant scene to an international audience. It will attract more food tourists, boosting the hospitality industry and local economies. Most importantly, it provides deserved recognition for the craftsmanship and dedicated hard work of Vietnamese chefs over generations.\n As a Vietnamese, I have long taken for granted the pleasures of Vietnam's cuisine. But global acknowledgement from prestigious groups like Michelin will be a source of pride for Vietnamese people everywhere. It demonstrates that our culture's softest power - our food - can compete on the world stage. I hope this is just the beginning and that more Vietnamese culinary masters will have their talents spotlighted in the years to come.\n Vietnamese restaurants have earned their place amongst the finest in the world. I hope the Michelin Guide and other international reviewers will help spread the word and introduce more people to the joys of Vietnamese gastronomy. Our chefs deserve this honor - now it's time for the world to feast their eyes and taste buds on what Vietnam has to offer.\n https://vietreader.com/travel/food/85667-70-michelin-honored-vietnamese-restaurants-and-eateries-in-2023-part-1.html\n    submitted by    /u/vinhta121290  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been using Zalo to communicate to my driver and team members when I'm back at my apartment / out of the office (I don't have Facebook, so this was a good alternative while out here).\n Unfortunately, I had to replace my phone last time and Zalo put me through some loops to basically \"re authenticate\" me by having someone already in my Zalo contacts confirm it's me. Naturally, that happened a few days before I flew back out here, so I was unable to get in touch with anyone when I landed (didn't realize this was needed until I landed). I eventually got hold of someone and they did the in-person verification.\n However, ever since then, the Zalo app keeps telling me I need to \"verify\" my account. It has an option to upload a photo of your passport but it doesn't seem to like an American passport. Do I need to verify? How do I do this? Anyone have experience making it work?\n I tried to chat with Zalo support but they only would message me in Vietnamese. I really only use this to keep in touch with my team, does verify even matter?\n    submitted by    /u/OldManKiK  \n [link]   [comments]",

The official word is that power cuts will be occuring daily due to \"El Nino\". \n Over the past week or so, my district (Long Bien) has experienced 5 outages that last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours at a time. We're told about them in the morning, so there isn't much time to plan around them as they start at 8 AM. \n Tonight, we've been told (officially) that the outages will occur each day for the next month. In my 9 years living in Hanoi, I've never experienced this before, yes, occasionally power will cut during a typhoon, but never like this. \n Does anyone else who is currently going through this have a backup generator? Is it worth investing in one? My wife and I run our business from home and we need to be online 24/7. We can't be out of the house for too long as we have 2 dogs that only pee outside and our son comes home for lunch and a nap each day. \n Need advice on how to deal with it. Can't move because we own our property. Should I buy a generator? Have you heard any information about the power cuts that might shed more light than our building's manager has already? Do you know someone who works in the energy sector that has mentioned it to you? Feeling absolutely helpess RN.\n    submitted by    /u/j3d321  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My parents and the older generation of my family, those who immigrated to the US, have always said that American and Western foods are always too salty or too sweet. They always say that too much salt or sugar is used. They also say this is why American food is so unhealthy.\n I‚Äôve mainly been raised up in the US and eat both Asian and Western cuisines but never found this to be true. I‚Äôve always found most foods to be reasonably seasoned to my tastes. I‚Äôve asked friends and family around my age, and they also generally agree with me. I also believe the whole ‚ÄúAmerican food is unhealthy‚Äù myth to be untrue because that really only applies to fast food which you really don‚Äôt eat on a daily basis. It‚Äôs also a huge over generalization of American cuisine considering how diverse each region and state is. I digress though. Is it really true that Vietnamese/Asian cuisine use less salt/sugar and are healthier than American/Western cuisine, or is this more of a subjective to taste thing?\n    submitted by    /u/QuaintAlex126  \n [link]   [comments]",

Last year I spent a month travelling your beautiful country, but this time I‚Äôm spending 2 weeks in Saigon. \n I‚Äôm looking to see if there is any sort of Hip Hop scene in Saigon? Have it be gigs, shops, painters, dancers, rappers and singer, anything really. I‚Äôm a street artist here in Australia and found a bit of a scene last year in Hanoi, so surely there is something going in in Saigon. \n Also, looking to go and see some good live music, both traditional and if there is any contemporary gigs. I‚Äôve found the opera which will be great to go to. But I‚Äôm open to anything really! Also if there is any race scene at all? I‚Äôve found a few clubs that have potential like Arcan. \n Thanks in advanced everyone. I‚Äôm so excited to be back in Vietnam next week!!!\n    submitted by    /u/No-Profile-9068  \n [link]   [comments]",

From our initial search, it may rain in DaNang in December? \n \nVenue availability in December: DaNang seem to be busy with tourists during December \n \n Main reason for considering DaNang/ Hoi An is half of the guests are non Vietnamese and these locations are unique to Vietnam. Since they are traveling to Vietnam, and may not travel again in future DaNang/ Hoi An has more cultural and tourist things todo. We might be wrong, but we don‚Äôt see something similar in or nearby Ho Chi Minh City. We would like your opinion/ suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/hopygopy  \n [link]   [comments]",

And people in some countries in Europe don't have AC at home, according to some of my friends in France, Spain and UK.\n Sales of portable air-conditioning units rose 2,420 percent in a week, British retailer Sainsbury‚Äôs said during the hot season last year. Some in Europe are coming to accept that some AC usage may be needed to save lives. After a heat wave killed an estimated 15,000 people in France in 2003, air conditioning was introduced to some nursing homes in a bid to protect the most vulnerable. \n How do you guys feel about AC in Vietnam, where the prices are cheap and almost every household in urban cities like Hanoi or Saigon has at least one.

Any tips for off the beaten track tours of 1 or 2 days on the Mekong Delta? We're used to road-trips and bumping into authentic experiences with people, a local guide in this case will probably give us insights we wouldn't otherwise have. I found something by Innoviet and Local-insider, but I still don't know if that is what we're looking for.

          "description": "Hi Viet Nam!\n Over the last year or two, I've been coming across articles about how major smartphone manufacturers have been increasingly shifting operations towards India and Viet Nam.\n As you know, China has been pretty much the \"factory of the world\" over the last 2 decades and her socioeconomic transformation has been astounding over the same period to say the least. Sadly, I was too young to pay attention then.\n Because of a rapidly aging population and diminishing workforce, cost of labour in China has risen exponentially. Coupled with constant, multi-front geopolitical tensions, one can understand why having operations in China faces a diminishing risk-reward ratio.\n Looking at Vietnam's Balance of Trade, I see that it's surged post-2015, around the time the protectionist Trump administration got elected - which I suppose accelerated the trend of de-coupling from China. However, the Vietnamese Dong seems to be facing a constant weakening, unlike that of an export hub. Somehow, I never see reports about how these winds are affecting regular Vietnamese citizens.\n Have you noticed a surge in manufacturing activity in Viet Nam?\n If so, how has this impacted you? \n Has the surge been driven by MNCs setting up their own plants, or have they been subcontracting to local manufacturers?\n Also, have these factories been concentrated in particular regions and therefore limited in benefit?\n Do you think Viet Nam will experience the same breakneck growth in the next decade as China did?\n I'm excited to hear the perspectives of people living through the change!\n    submitted by    /u/polymathicus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I¬¥m using the \"Assimil\" language course book for self study to learn Vietnamese. \n Yesterday tho, I watched a video about the usage of Vietnamese pronouns by Tieng Viet Oi, which is a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching Vietnamese, and they explained the use of the pronouns in a completely different way than my course book uses them!\n Now I feel insecure and I don¬¥t know, if I should keep on using my course book, because I don¬¥t want to learn this major part of the language in a wrong way! I don¬¥t doubt, that the infos given by Tieng Viet Oi are wrong, because they¬¥re native speakers, but maybe my book uses rules that they left out? I don¬¥t know! Can you native speakers out there tell me, if this use of the pronouns makes any sense, or if my course book isn¬¥t a good source?\n ‚Äã\n 1.Dialogue:\n Person1, Stranger: calls other c√¥ / Person2, stranger: calls other √¥ng - formal setting\n 2.Dialogue\n Person1, waiter: calls other b√† / Person2, customer: calls other √¥ng - restaurant order\n 3.Dialogue\n Person1, knows other person, not closest friends: calls other anh / Person2, same as other: calls other chi (dot under i) - colloquial talk\n ‚Äã\n --> also the book explains the pronouns as:\n -c√¥: young women or women who aren¬¥t married\n -√¥ng: men older than 40 years\n -b√†: elderly women or married women\n -anh/chi(dot): people you know and that are around your age\n ‚Äã\n (it doesn¬¥t really consider the relationship between the speaker and the other person!)\n ‚Äã\n I¬¥m sorry for the long post! I¬¥d really appreciate any adivce, because I fell in love with the Vietnamese language and I just want to keep on studying!

Many songs about mothers talk about the mother raising the singer, which isn‚Äôt genuine to our relationship. I‚Äôm hoping to find a song whose lyrics work coming from me.\n Do you know of any sweet, heartfelt songs in Vietnamese that are about a mother-in-law? Or about a mother, but without focusing on how the mother raised the singer? Or a song about an amazing, strong person without any romantic subtext?\n My fianc√©e‚Äôs cousin helped me find M·∫π Y√™u by ƒê·ªó Ph√∫ Qu√≠, which sounds perfect, but reading a translation of the lyrics, seems to focus too much on how the mother raised the singer. But maybe the sentiment would still work?\n Thank you for helping me make the day special for my (soon-to-be) mother-in-law!\n    submitted by    /u/lol43  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My cousin and I are planning a trip to southeast Asia from mid-November thru early December. Most likely a November 14 departure and a December 3-4 return. We are both guys in our mid/late 20s from Los Angeles. We like nature (hiking + excursions), nature sightseeing, large cities, food, and partying.\n We were set on doing 2 weeks in Thailand but are now considering adding 4-5 days in Vietnam due to the recommendations of many family members & friends.\n Our initial plan was to do 3-5 days in Bangkok & Pattaya and then travel south for the remainder of the trip to see Phuket and Koh Phi Phi.\n So my main question is this: If we have 4-5 days, how would you recommend we spend it in Vietnam? Bangkok and Hanoi? Is it possible to truly experience these 2 major Vietnamese cities in that short of time? Should we omit one? Maybe reduce some of our time in Thailand?\n I understand there are dozens of great places we'll be missing... But I am hoping some seasoned travelers or residents of either country can give feedback/advice. It is MUCH appreciated!!\n    submitted by    /u/mike10345  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "According to Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Thanh Lam, Vietnam leads the world in cyber abuse to cheat and violate the law.\n At the Multi-Channel Management Networking Workshop on the morning of May 27 in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Nguyen Thanh Lam said:\n \"For every 100 dong earned from cheating on YouTube, there are 55 dong of Vietnamese users. We are at the top of the list for copyright infringement. There is a football livestream channel that violates copyright like Xoi Lac TV. There is a channel that buys Japanese porn, cuts it into many short clips, and then packs it and sells it to the American audience.\"\n Lam said the country in second place in the ranking accounts for only 5% of fraudulent income, one-tenth of Vietnam. Last week, Apple also announced to remove more than 8,000 infringing applications originating in Vietnam, many of which are content creation applications.\n The deputy minister said that this is a sad record, exposing the fact that besides positive content, many creators still do business and make money regardless. Part of the responsibility lies with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook when they can't control the content and users on the platform. Advertisers also have a responsibility to still spend money on dirty content.\n \"The state does not prevent businesses from wanting to advertise in cyberspace, but it is impossible for a money to flow into malicious content that businesses still see as normal,\" Mr. Lam said.\n https://vnexpress.net/100-dong-gian-lan-tren-youtube-55-dong-cua-nguoi-viet-4610452.html\n    submitted by    /u/quochuy2021  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please help me out!\n  \nIs Cat Ba Island worth it? We wanted to avoid the crowd in Ha Long Bay, but stay near the sea and relax. \n Any suggestions for Cat Ba, like places to eat/ things to do/ places to stay?\n Best way to travel from Hanoi to Cat Ba and back?\n For Hanoi, we have Egg Coffee, Bahn Mi (and a lot more food items) and Beer Street on our list already, but any hidden/hole in the wall places that are away from commercial tourism would be great to know. Very open to trying authentic vietnamese food and drinks!! \n Any suggestions for a reputable spa experience in Cat Ba or Hanoi are most welcome\n Any suggestions for where to go for a party in Hanoi?

The Golden Star represents the everlasting bond between Vietnam's people and their striving for greatness and prosperity for all Vietnamese people, regardless of their geographical location or political stances.\n With my loving heart, I invite every one of you to print this flag out, show it to your parents and especially grandparents and display it proudly in your windows.

          "description": "In recent years, Vietnam has been making strides in the world of technology and innovation. With the rise of start-ups and the increasing number of high-tech companies moving their branch offices to Vietnam, is there a possibility that Vietnam, this Southeast Asian nation, could become the next start-up nation in Asia?\n The shift from China to Vietnam has been noticeable, with companies such as Samsung, LG, and Intel all establishing a strong presence in Vietnam. This trend is not limited to just large corporations, as start-ups are also finding success in Vietnam's growing tech scene.\n One reason for Vietnam's appeal is its young and highly educated population. According to the World Bank, nearly 60% of Vietnam's population is under the age of 35, and the country boasts a literacy rate of over 95%. This has created a strong talent pool for tech companies to draw from.\n Another factor contributing to Vietnam's potential as a start-up nation is its favorable business environment. The Vietnamese government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurship. The country has also made significant improvements in infrastructure, including expanding its internet connectivity and investing in new technology parks.\n However, there are still challenges that Vietnam must overcome in order to fully realize its potential as a start-up nation. One major hurdle is the lack of venture capital funding available for start-ups. While the government has taken steps to address this issue, more needs to be done in order to attract investment and support the growth of new businesses.\n Source & full text from https://www.micronews.site/2023/05/will-vietnam-become-next-start-up.html\n    submitted by    /u/very-creative  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do tourists usually visit there in summer? Do public buildings, restaurants and trains have AC? Do locals spend time outside during the day or do they usually try to stay inside?\n Pretty much what I wanna know is if I'll be able to have a good time despite the warm weather and rain. I live in Europe and the climate here is quite different from SE Asia, so apologies if some of my questions come across as naive or uneducated. \n Either way, I know there's no definitive answer to this, but any helpful advice is much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/imakuni1995  \n [link]   [comments]",

My Viet language skills are actually not too bad, so I can get around by myself, order my own food, shopping, basic conversation. \n Anyway, my in laws are coming here for a visit, it's winter so doing some of the really great Australian outdoor type activities, so we are gonna take them out for dinners, some shows etc. We have planned for a weekend away in a cottage in the countryside with some of my family. Now my in laws speak next to zero english, and my family speak no Viet. \n I'm just wondering if anyone might have some suggestions for some good activities we could enjoy together without having to rely to heavily on my wife to translate constantly. Like some games or activities or board games etc. We can do while enjoying a couple of beers by the fireplace.

          "description": "Just landed at in HCMC. Wanted to share some things I saw for foreigners in terms of how to get into town with zero stress taking a grab.\n 1) Go through customs, Exit international terminal. Look for the green umbrella tents across the street. 100 yards max. cant miss them. 5-6 large green umbrellas. I dont ever remember seeing these before. \n 2) open grab and use the green umbrella area as your pick up spot.\n it should cost you 125k dong to get into D1. Grab will add 15k for the airport toll. Total bill should be about 140k + any surge. The driver pays the toll.\n Waiting for grab at 6am = 10 mins\n ride to D1 took 15-20 mins.\n Cost was 140k dong which is like 7 bux. and best was ZERO stress of being ripped. had 3-4 taxi guys approach and follow me to grab area.\n    submitted by    /u/trojanmana  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Foodie friend asked me to help ask around...\n La Maison 1888 is the French fine dining restaurant of Intercontinental Hotel Da Nang. This hotel is a 30 minute car ride away from the main beach because it is on the far end of the coast, and it does not allow Grab pickups out of the hotel. The restaurant is built into an old villa on a cliff, overlooking the water, and is very beautiful. They emphasize that they have the only 3 Michelin star French chef working there, and claim to be the #1 food destination in Vietnam. (Tasting menu is VND4-5M.)\n The advertising feels scammy because there is no such thing as a Michelin star chef. They claim the chef helped design the menu and he runs a 3 Michelin star restaurant in Paris, which is not the same thing and he is not in the Da Nang restaurant. Vietnam will only get Michelin rated retaurants in 2023, and only in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. There are very few blog reviews about the restaurant, and their TripAdvisor and Google Maps reviews do not imply that this is a legendary must try before you die place.\n Can Vietnam foodies comment?\n Sample blog post: https://secretlifeoffatbacks.com/20...-sun-peninsula-resort-the-ultimate-in-luxury/\n    submitted by    /u/josemartinlopez  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When in Thailand I got full body massages once a week. No happy endings, and never had it on my list of things to try. I just wanted to relax my muscles from full days of walking, and only went to places that had signs saying \"no sex\".\n Landed in Hanoi a few days ago and went for a full body Vietnamese massage at a parlor where the women were dressed up in everyday clothing. So I thought this massage was gonna be like in Thailand, and solely for muscle relaxation and recovery from walking.\n I turn on my back and massage was good, then all of a sudden I start to notice the lady spending a lot of time in my groin region. I thought i may have felt really tight there, so maybe she was working out some knots..\n I was wrong, I was getting aroused, and she knew as well. Then tells me she'll give me a good massage and motions for a \"special\" type of massage..\n There was NO intentions of me getting one, and I thought I was just getting a regular massage as I always have in Thailand.\n Anyone else have this happen?? It was pretty funny looking back at it, and still no \"special massages\" since being in Asia.\n    submitted by    /u/Cacho_Later  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My Viet boyfriend and I (South Korean girl) have dated for a year. We‚Äôre at the same age (2000 kids). We studied abroad at the same uni in Canada. Last year, my parents came to Canada to attend my convocation. I introduced him to my parents, and they're really impressed with him bc of his family background, handsome face, height, education and graduation job (these things are very important in Korean culture), \n Next month, he and I will travel to Vietnam for summer vacation and visit his parents in Hanoi. I wanna make them impressed just like he did on my mom and dad. \n What can I do to impress his parents?Especially when I come to his family house, and we do not speak the same language. \n Do old Viet people judge girls by their look, family background like Korean do? I‚Äôm quite confident but I don‚Äôt look like Viet girls.\n My Viet female friend say Hanoi parents are extremely conservative. Is that true?\n What gifts should I give to them? I have some high-end korean skincare products for his mom, but have no idea for his dad.\n Update: thank you guys for great suggestions. As I know from my Viet female friend, his parents are well off and live in a big mansion in Hanoi. That could mean they‚Äôre open minded like you guys commented. I‚Äôm confident in answering all questions regarding family background, I know rich Asian people care about these things. My dad also asked him about his dad‚Äôs job when we had dinner in Toronto. My boy has a brother who has a wife working as IELTS teacher. Both of them can speak English, so luckily I have more people to talk without translation and support me. So excited to come to üáªüá≥üáªüá≥ for the first time\n    submitted by    /u/rachel_hwang_2000  \n [link]   [comments]",
