          "description": "I will be traveling Vietnam for the first time next year as a Viet kieu (pretty fluent in Vietnamese). I will be there for 3 weeks with arrival in Saigon and departure in Hanoi.\n I’m open to feedback on my itinerary from all of you travel experts/expats/locals. I have zero expectation on following this itinerary 100% since I know that’s not feasible and unforeseen situations may arise. I like to have my days planned out so that I’m not scratching my head on what to do when I get there.\n I enjoy food as you can tell from the amount of food tours but also enjoy activities and nature/scenery. If you have any recommendations outside of what is on my itinerary, please share. All recommendations for attractions/restaurants/coffee shops/street food/shopping centers/markets would be appreciated. Also if you guys know of any pedestrian friendly/walking areas that are not on my itinerary, please let me know. I like to explore on foot but also know that Vietnam is not the most walk friendly country.\n Is 3 days too long for Ninh Binh?

My friend (45m) and I (40m) are coming to Vietnam from about Jan 1 to Jan 31. \n Neither of us like planning much so right now I’m inclined to just book a hotel or air b and b for 7 days to start in HCMC and figure out the rest after we get there. \n We will probably bounce over to Thailand for a few days, maybe Cambodia and Laos and I have to pop up to Hong Kong to see a friend for a few days. \n Mostly we just want to explore and eat, maybe do some light hikes and we’ll probably both spend a decent amount of time alone. \n Is it pretty easy to work stuff out after we get there?\n Also, kinda random but is Amex accepted pretty widely there?

(I do a lot of bike and bikepacking in France so I'm pretty ok with that).\n I didn't have any driver licence so I can't rent a powerful motorbike, and I don't want to have any issues with the local police\n I'm also planning to stay in \"homestay\" like; guesthouses; etc\n So I had a few questions:\n -Can I find a long-term (3 weeks) for a 50cc scooter in Ho Chi Minh City or maybe buy one ? I wonder what's the best solution.\n -Did the road/dirt road are practicable on a 50cc scooter or a bike ?\n -Did you have any advice about the project ?\n I already look on internet, but I can't find so much infos on the Mekong Delta and backpacking it.\n Thanks all for your answers !\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/ArtbiVN  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been to both cities previously, as well as Da Nang & Hue. So I’ve basically seen most of the touristy stuff there (including Ha Long Bay) and have decided to skip central VietNam entirely this time around.\n I’m thinking of making a side trip to Sapa while up north and potentially Da Lat or the Mekong delta while in HCMC. \n Is two days in Sapa enough time to see most things there or should I add an extra day? Is Da Lat worth checking out for two days or so? How about the Mekong delta? I know both cities are pretty touristy and I can live with that. I just want to check out new places and get out of the hustle of the big cities. \n Since I’ve done Hanoi and HCMC, I just plan on chilling, eating while there so my days spent in the smaller cities is flexible. \n Also, I know the weather is hot/humid year round, but should I expect rain during this time of year?\n Thanks for any suggestions or recommendations!\n    submitted by    /u/H_ade_s  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was on STEM OPT, and my employer was willing to sponsor my H1-B visa. \n Things were looking up for a bit, and I thought I could settle in America. However, my health worsened in September 2022, and I was constantly sick every month. I got a serious case of vertigo that made me spend a day in the ER in August. And then, a month later I got diagnosed with H Pylori, a nasty stomach virus that could cause severe heartburn. In December 2022, I got Covid after attending happy hour with my coworkers. I had to deal with all of these along with anxiety and depression. In March 2023, I decided to quit my job and move back to Vietnam because I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't even apply for the STEM extension or participate in the H1-B lottery. \n I moved to Saigon after coming back to Vietnam (I'm from Hanoi), but I still feel like a loser for coming back to Vietnam. When I set out to study in America, my goal was to get a job and a green card and then I would choose where to live. However, things didn't go as planned, and I am completely lost. I am scared of getting back into the corporate world because of what happened to me. I'm scared that my health will be in jeopardy again. I'm still looking and applying for jobs right now, but deep down I wish no one would hire me so that I could rest for a bit more. \n Now I'm completely lost because the goal that I had been working towards for 5+ years was squashed, and now I have no goals or directions.

We moved in a hotel in the tourist area for a month and almost every night at this outside Huda bar there was a white puppy sitting on a folding chair. He had a leash and tip jar next to him and I would always go up and pet him (I asked if I could pet him every time). And I fell in love with the little guy. So one day I went to the pet store near by and bought some puppy sized toys to give to him. When I saw the puppy again a few days later I patted him and gave him a rope toy to play with and we tugged it and all that cute stuff. I left him with the toy and saw the puppy about a week later without it. I never saw him since then. Is it bad here to gift a dog a toy?

          "description": "I live in VN as foreigner. I know that vietnamese love karaoke and it's fine. Until they crank up the volume to absolutely outrageous level.\n I live in a very good place and very nice city, but unfortunately to me there are few villas nearby where drunk viet people like to sing karaoke almost every day up until midnight. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I understand they want to have fun. I understand they are drunk and don't care about other people.\n What I don't understand is why no one is doing anything about it? 20 drunk people affect thousands citizens who live nearby. Everyone is happy about noise? Can't believe it.\n Now the main part: there are four 5* star hotels near these villas. Classy, expensive, with good cars around it, etc et etc. Why management is doing nothing about drunkards in villas? It is so easy to call police. It is so easy to give them some money so they patrol this area a little more often. Submit complains, escalate problems to police superiors, even bribe if needed, etc etc. But why nothing? I live here for 6 months and problem doesn't go away. \n I have so many questions.\n Hotel customers don't complain even when karaoke blasts at midnight? Hotel management doesnt care about anyone? Police doesnt care about 5* star hotels?\n Maybe vietnamese customers dont care about noise even if they rich because they are used to karaoke from their childhood. But what about foreign customers who live in 5* hotels? They don't complain too? I can hardly believe foreigners love this noise while they pay big sums of money for fancy hotel.\n Can some explain me this mystery?\n    submitted by    /u/superfastracoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n Sooo, I am a 26yo art student, viet born in western europe and would love to explore some contemporary art spaces and the creative wave that’s been happening and just learn about the people and the culture.\n The thing is that I visited last summer, the first time in 15 years and was with family most of the time. This was a beautiful experience but also, I was super annoyed with how paranoid my family was about me doing stuff alone. I always needed someone of my family to be there with me or someone they knew to escort me around for the most simple things like getting a juice around the corner. \n The main thing they’re scared off is me being sold, kidnapped or deceived and drugged, because I’m recognizable as a Viet Kieu and am female. Sometimes I get mistaken for being fully foreigner, like Thai or Indonesian, cause I don’t look like the typical Viet when it comes to my style or my accent, or whatever reason they say I don’t look like a typical viet. (fam also say I’m too ‘hiện’ lol)\n The thing is, I just want to explore places, meet likeminded creatives and enjoy my culture outside of the family. But is it true that I’m not safe doing things on my own? Can I really not take Grab’s without the chance of being kidnapped? Can I really trust no one?\n My family be saying crazy stuff like ‘dont go on dates cause if you reject him, he’ll drug you’ or ‘white people have it easier in VN than Viet Kieu’ 🤡\n Anyway, thoughts? I just wanna explore new spaces and hang out with new people but how my family puts it; I’m in danger as a female not viet-born person doing things on my own.\n    submitted by    /u/_honeyloops_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone! My husband and I are visiting Vietnam this upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. We are planning a trip with my parents who live in Vietnam for 5 days during the 2 weeks before the holiday. My parents want to go from Quang Binh to Hoi An in 5 days. They want to visit Phong Nha Cave, Paradise Cave, Hoi An, Da Nang, and Hue. The plan is that we will land in Da Nang and travel with them immediately.\n  \nWe will not use a tour agency so I am a little afraid of how many destinations they want to go to within such a small timeframe. Definitely, we will use public transportation to commute and that takes a lot of time to commute already. \n The current itinerary: Quang Binh (1 day), Hue (1 day), Da Nang (1-2 day), and Hoi An (1 day)\n I hate jet lag and I want to take it slow to adjust to the local time when I first land. \n We would like to enjoy the trip rather than move through each location super fast. We are considering tailoring in Hoi An for our wedding and it seems to not be doable with this iterary.\n I heard Hoi An is super crowded and 2 out of 5 days we plan to travel are weekends. \n We love our parents but at the same time, we really want to visit Da Nang-Hoi An without rushing it.\n  \nDo you think this is a good idea? How can we commute between places if this trip is doable?\n I am gearing towards traveling to Ha Noi (3 days) and Halong Bay (cruise-2 days) so that we can experience the Northern vibe of the Tet holiday and enjoy more time on the trip.\n    submitted by    /u/kttrxn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I went to Vietnam in June for a few weeks with my wife and daughter. We went to Ho Chi Minh City, Que Nhon, and Dalat. We decided to buy insurance from Berkshire Hathaway Travel protection. We chose the coverage that only covered medical emergencies. The price was less than 100$. Mid way through our trip my daughter became very sick fever ect. She had a bacteria infection which landed her in the hospital for anti-biotics when over the counter did not do the trick. We stayed at Vinmec got receipts for everything and ended up staying in the hospital for 7 days. The cost for everything came out to around 3,000. Vinmec gave us all receipts in English and Vietnamese. I opened a case with Berkshire while on Vietnam and they said I had a year to send all docs. When we got home I sent all receipts and charges from my credit card they also asked for bank statements and after 25 days I received a check for the full amount. They covered the hospital stay, medicine, emergency room visit too. It was my first experience with Berkshire but will use them in the future. I recommended this to my friend that also went recently and she also has to take her daughter to the hospital it wasn't expensive but it sounds like it was covered her bill was only 300$\n    submitted by    /u/jackhammer1198  \n [link]   [comments]",

I chose 2 apples and a kaki fruit, the owner said it cost 190k, which I think is a lot (same fruits would cost me only about 50k in my home country), so I offered 50k instead, which they refused after a bit of back and forth. My partner said to go, it's a scam but I feel bad/unsure. I know as tourists we usually get offered higher prices but I'm wondering if there is maybe something \"special\" about these fruits that make them expensive.

And I know they’re Korean because I can hear them speak it.\n **I’m not saying it’s only native Koreans, but most of my interactions have been this way. I never experience this with Korean Americans back home, rich or middle class, so that’s why I’m so culture shocked by this behavior!\n Examples:\n Usually people move aside or try to avoid hitting the other person when walking opposite directions on a sidewalk.\n  \nI’ve been very harshly shoved by the shoulders or arms by Korean tourists who don’t even attempt to avoid me even when I try to avoid them. They’ll walk in a straight line, unwaivering, & will shove me hard then keep walking straight without looking back at who they hit. This has happened on multiple occasions where they can easily avoid hitting me as I try to avoid them.\n  \nWaiting\n  \nWhen waiting in line, I’ll just have a random Korean person shove their way in front of me as if I don’t exist. Same thing if I’m looking at something, but I’m standing to the side to allow others to walk by. \n They’ll stand close & right in front of the displays, blocking me even though it’s clear I’m looking & trying to grab something.\n  \nSeats\n  \nAt busy buffets, they’ll deny you sitting at the end of their empty table & far away by saying it’s full. Meanwhile, it’s empty the entire time we’re there. \n  \nI haven’t experienced that with British, American, or Uzbek tourists at all. It’s literally just native Koreans. It’s driving me nuts!

This makes no sense to me because no one in Vietnam would know how to pronounce my last name, and no one in America would call a child by their last name. \n Are there other options?

Or if you have any other recommendation to bring back to US, I muchly appreciated.\n Also - is it safe to use CC in Grab? I have friends that pay cash instead of paying cc thru app. I hate carrying cash :)\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Witty_Reading_1720  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I carry this with me for quite a while already: \n I live in Vietnam, and a friend of mine, around 30, from a European country, told me in 2021 already the he need to get to Saigon to his embassy to get a new passport. Quite difficult during Covid, he also doesn’t have big cash to pay for the trip, so he kept on delaying it, until his passport ran out of validity. \n In early 2023 he made the trip to Saigon finally by taking the train, told me he can’t fly because no passport, so Train best option. When he came back from that trip a couple days later I asked him about passport and if he got his, he told me not yet, embassy have problems bla bla bla. \n Since then, he told me like three times on different occasions that he moved into a new place under his girlfriends name and kinda hides from immigration and doesn’t really care. If that’s true, we talking about a looooong overstay. \n So my question: \n 1.) I feel he‘s telling me BS, but why would make shit like that up. What’s the intention??\n 2.) Assume he‘s telling the truth, what „problems“ could his embassy make to not give him a new passport?\n 3.) Could he really „hide“ from VN police and just overstay months without them seeking for him / finding him? What’s the play here, they actively looking for him or just waiting and hope they catch him one day? He‘s not really „quiet“ about his situation so I know the circle of people Knowing is not small either and I just can’t imagine they not knowing and not caring and not finding.\n This whole story is so damn stupid and I can’t make sense of it. Really looking to hear some fresh opinions on that.\n Edit: Could be he meant „consulate“ instead, I know a lot of people use the word „embassy“ but actually meaning „consulate“, so that’s not the big issue here. \n Edit 2: Thanks for the replies guys!\n    submitted by    /u/medium_nice_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I looked at him and he looks a little rough, probably a laborer from his clothes and calloused hands, and maybe an ethnic minority as well.

He gave me his card, so I showed him step by step instructions on how to use an ATM, including the part where I told him to put in his PIN in secret and he blurbed out load to me 666666, I was just like bruh 😳.

I left in 2012 and haven’t been back since - so I’m extremely excited to come back home! :) I’m sure I’ll be shocked at how much has changed! It’s also my girlfriend’s first time in the country. \n We’re going to be spending Christmas in HCMC (where I grew up), and before that well be in Hoi An. I’m wondering where we can go after for 1.5 weeks of relax. We want a nice beach destination with some beautiful properties, activities, maybe some historical sites, nice restaurants, and somewhere to celebrate the new year! \n When I was growing up, my parents and I would take quick weekend trips from HCMC to Mui Ne/Vung Tau for the beach, but I’m not sure these are the best options. \n We heard mixed reviews about Phu Quoc, but everyone is suggesting Da Nang! What do you all recommend? Keeping in mind it’s end of December/January. \n Any place in particular? Would appreciate ANY help! :)) \n Cam on!\n    submitted by    /u/morninglightshine  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all,\n So I lived in Vn for a few years and I absolutely love the place. \n I'm looking at coming back to do business now my country has signed a free trade deal with Vietnam. \n Some friends and I have been trying to contact various places to establish contact with experts in several fields, and we find more often than not that emails on official websites are either unmonitered or they bounce back as inactive addresses. \n Now I know that business in Vietnam is very much a face-to-face kind of thing, but we're trying to establish some form of rapport before we come over for a expeditionary visit. \n How do people on the ground deal with this? \n Are phone calls and not email the primary means of making initial contact with people?\n I'd appreciate some advice for making contacts in Vietnam before we travel there. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Square-Row-9674  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I am planning to stay in Saigon and Hanoi each for an extended period to immerse myself, meet locals, and learn about the ways lives are lived there. (What other reason is there to travel?) I am wondering if anyone has any useful insights for extended stay in these cities, or even suggestions of other cities or towns which would have much to offer for an immersive stay.

As such, there have not been many big events dedicated to this awesome hobby.\n Started out as a local event for tabletop gamers, we are bringing back Board Game Fest for the 3rd time, this time on a scale bigger than ever before. With 150 game tables, hundred of board games and several dozen of Game Master and staff, we hope this will be a welcoming event for everyone, young and old, Vietnamese and foreigners alike. There will be many booths with all the big board game coffees in Hanoi, leading board game publishers from Vietnam where you can experience their games/ services. Whether you are new to board game and want to try out some amazing-looking games; or want to check out some of our never-before-seen self-published titles; or just want to hang out and potentially meet someone who shares your interest, there is something for you at our event.\n The event venue will be at TH School - yes that's the beautiful pink building right on Chua Boc street. Book your tickets now to enjoy the best deal (we are only selling tickets to provide a big nice venue for the event). Details in the poster below!\n If you're anyway interested and have further question, feel free to reach me via PM or via our FB page. Our team want make this a meaningful annual event and help grow the tabletop community, so I really hope you will consider joining our tables, and hope we will have a great time together!!\n https://preview.redd.it/fjm72fi51rub1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a7a49c6a652d9115c67e07d89b425368b3675af\n    submitted by    /u/MarshMaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If you love zombie movies you have given some thoughts on what happens if something like a zombie apocalypse happens in Vietnam.\n My thoughts are Mekong Delta region would be swarmed with hordes of zombies and would be really dangerous to live. Crowed Cities like HCMC or Hanoi would be totally infected in just a couple of days considering the population density.\n Vietnamese dont have guns. So people would be defenseless. Its dangerous to engage zombies in a melee combat. Except groups of ex militants. But zombies are not good as traversing hard terrain. And Vietnam is full of such terrain,85% of territory is mountain so if you just go and make a settlement in a sloppy area. You should be safe. Except for anomalies.\n Best thing i can think of to do is go to high altitude area. A really high place.I would like move to North West or Tay Nguyen regions. Fansipan is a good choice.The Mainly hunting or can even cultivate if you have some offensive weapons to take dons a couple of zombies that might appear. My choice is live on the top of terraced fields so you never worry about food.Vietnam would be among the safest places against zombie. If you have some resources to sustain your self in remote hard terrain.\n    submitted by    /u/Idiocracy_Homosapien  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "From my perspective as a 23 year old, I support innovation in education. Professor Ho Ngoc Dai, as a prominent figure in education reforming who had gone through the hard times in Vietnam, even consider children like a friend, once said \"if you consider them like a friend, then you can't scold them\". Unfortunately, majority of people in Vietnam and even ppl of my age still support this way of \"education\", like wtf how can you say you beat them because you \"care\" about them, which is total hypocrisy. And then the \"backthen we got beaten and that gave us success\" mentality, which is totally survivorship bias because those people only got like good job with average income, maybe higher because backthen there were more opportunities due to booming economy in early 90s and 2000s. And if the method works then why is corruption and crime is still rampant in the country? \n Of course this is a cultural issue, and I'm sure that many people may be triggered and even compare to the US or something. And yes, Vietnam is no doubt a part of sinosphere where collectivism and conservatism is widespread, people don't change much and clings to Confucian values much like the way Islamists clings to orthodox view.

However, speaking to multiple of these agencies today, it appears most of them don't even know what I'm talking about... Closest I got was a half day scooter tour to Bat Trang. I can find some info online, but also on here it's rarely mentioned. \n What I was looking/hoping for was a day-tour where you get to visit 3to4 of these villages and can experience/whitness the different craftsman in action.\n Is this maybe not a thing anymore? Is the info in my guide outdated? Has anyone on here ever visited (some of) these villages and was it worth it? Which ones would you recommend?\n Thanks!

I can even smell them from inside my apartment. I was planning to take a job here, but don't think I can since this is such a big deal for me and affects my physical and mental health. (I also love walking, and this city is probably level 99 difficulty for pedestrians) \n The noise pollution is pretty bad and I can't sleep. There are bikes outside with loudspeakers blaring the same line over and over. I've stayed in four different apartments and every single one has had loud construction noise from 6am-10pm, every day. Even on Sunday. I was once woke up by hammering noise from inside another apartment at 2am! It seems inescapable. I noticed my ears are ringing when inside when it's silent. Everything is so loud here. \n That's manageabke though. The worst for me is the air. Although it's pretty good in general compared to hanoi, the traffic just overrides that. \n When is the metro expected to be built? My daily transportation spending was lower in Singapore than in Saigon 🙁\n Is there any area with low traffic and good air quality? Has anyone else felt the bad effects of pollution since moving here?\n    submitted by    /u/waterlimes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n New account due to privacy reasons.\n I cannot wrap my head around VNese housing market. Used to live in Hanoi, HCM and Danang. Currently scouting Danang properties. Seen maybe over 100 various land/houses options within 5-20B range. And it just throws me away, as I cannot see any logic, behind pricing strategy.\n For example, I've came across several options such as 180sqm land cost 7B, and then 2 parallel streets further - 12B or so. In comparison, neighbourhood is the same, surrounding space/layout was similar too.\n The market seems very saturated. Tons of listings for bigger land (150sqm+). With huge price fluctuation (35M/sqm - 70M/sqm).\n My question is, how does one can buy any of this? With current mortgage rates (12-15% after excluding first few years) it's a money burn going that route. Further, if I understand correctly, VNmese are not very encouraged to take this route, since rates most of the time we're high (~6%), compared with West (1-2%).\n I can only see smaller properties to be in a hot market (3-5B), as it's easier to deal via loans/mortgages, but going further, especially 8B+ route - it becomes a madness.\n Given the market in HCM, I'd see that there is no stop in price increase. I can feel now that it's more of a stagnation period. I'd like to believe, that prices would come down, but at the same time - I feel that greed will be the driver for prices fueling up. However, question appears - how long can this last?\n What I guess, VNese take 7-9% fixed mortgage for 2 years, buy something and try to flip it. Is there any other way, they are able to afford and buy lands/houses for that much?\n What keeps me up at night is that there is just so many listings in Danang, prices seems to be inflated and yet, sellers aren't willing to go much lower. However buyers market is definitely not here as well (for at least 8B+ listings).\n Would love to hear your experience and thoughts while navigating this market!\n    submitted by    /u/Intelligent_Neck_927  \n [link]   [comments]",

We came knowing that it was the wet season but the day we got to Hue my partner came down with some sort of tummy bug... \n We're taking it easy for a couple of days and keeping the kiddo as entertained as possible but I'm now feeling a little concerned regarding our plans to travel to Da Nang on the 15th. \n We are getting the train in and our hotel is very close to the beach in the center most part. \n Judging from the news stories of flooding I can't see how us turning up will be a good thing for ourselves, and the already struggling local services. \n From a travel weary father of a toddler and partner of a sick girlfriend, please may I have some advice on how to proceed? \n Our flight leaves from Ho Chi Minh on the evening of the 19th and we have a connecting flight from Da Nang that morning. \n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/harrylarryharry  \n [link]   [comments]",

But quite the contrary was the case.\n I had lots of great experiences in Hanoi and people were generally friendly.\n I often heard that people there are not smiling but I didn’t see that at all. When people see me they show me a peace sign ✌️ or wave and invite me for a cigarette or the tobacco bong or this self made alcohol ( I think it’s ginseng but idk for sure ) \n Generally I found people very open towards me,maybe those bad experiences people talk about only happen in the city center?\n What I also find interesting is that people talk to me in full blown Vietnamese which I find refreshing. They don’t dumb down or change to English, they just talk and try to make me understand with sign language lol 😂.\n Everytime I’m in Hanoi I feel like my Vietnamese improves a lot.\n Anyways just wanted to share my experience in Hanoi.\n    submitted by    /u/Olithenomad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I didn't ask this question on r/HistoryWhatIf or any alternate history channel because most of them have no idea of European history. \n Vietnam is a nation that is well-known for being extremely good at fighting wars, managing to gain independence from a strong nation like China, defeating the Mongols, and expanding down from the Red River Delta to the Mekong Delta, destroying Champa and Cambodia in the process. They also defeated the French, Americans, and Chinese forces which threatened their independence in the 20th century and managed to overthrow the Khmer Rouge which were battle-hardened troops, or so many internet historians say. \n However, during the 18th-19th centuries, there were many wars the Vietnamese had against the Siamese over the control of Laos and Cambodia. While both sides had their victories and losses, the Vietnamese won more conflicts than the Siamese, which is weird since Laos was controlled by the Siamese while Cambodia was jointly-controlled, meaning that the Siamese gained more land in the war. \n In 1800, Siam had a population of 4 million while Vietnam had a population of 7 million, almost 2 times more. \n Without European colonialism, would Vietnam had conquered Siam like how they conquered Champa and the Mekong Delta? Or was Siam too strong of a kingdom to conquer? \n Many Thais don't know much about the Siamese-Vietnamese wars since it is skipped over in history classes. As I'm not a Vietnamese, I don't know whether these wars are taught much in Vietnamese schools but I'm sure Vietnamese people are more knowledgable in their histories than Thais are in theirs. So I decided to ask the question here. \n    submitted by    /u/MaxMaxMax_05  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everyone tells me the same thing to just \"find a quiet road, fuck around for 30 minutes and you'll be fine\", but also these are the same people that end up hurting themselves or worse - someone else. \n I don't want a lecture on being a dumb foreigner causing accidents on mopeds because we don't know how to ride them properly, I'm genuinely trying to ask what is a relatively ethical and normal way to learn to ride a moped here? How do you go from no prior experience to taking on the sea of bikes in the big city?\n Currently staying in Hanoi and feel a bit limited to using Grab to get everywhere, especially for the future when I would like to travel to more rural regions that don't have the same accessibility without a bike.

I also have seen the opposite story, where pro-West Vietnamese condemn Vietnam for staying neutral.\n The conversation, unpleasant as it was, was quite interesting. Which do diaspora Vietnamese community care more about, the interests of their native country or the interests of Vietnam ?\n For example, let's say if Taiwan and China went to war, would you expect Vietnam to do something about it for the interest of Taiwan / China because you live in Taiwan / China ? Cause I really don't see the point of Vietnam picking a side.\n Whenever you vote for your leader in your country, do you pick them for the interests of Vietnam ? When Trump got elected, my friends studying in US were absolutely terrified, because they were afraid of him imposing strict laws on immigrants, and that was not a good thing for Vietnamese who tried to work and study over there.\n    submitted by    /u/Gigamadon  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Apparently, Vietnamese pronouns are really hard for many learners, so I decided to make that one of the first things I'd tackle in the language. Correct me if my explanation is wrong.\n Vietnamese has a few pronouns, of course. The pronoun for I is fairly common, for instance. However, it seems like Vietnamese likes to avoid using true first and second person pronouns, like other Asian languages. However, that means you need some other way to distinguish yourself and different people in conversations.\n Vietnamese chooses age and gender. You imagine that this person is a part of your family and choose a pronoun for you and a pronoun for them that agrees. For example, I would call myself big brother if I'm talking to a little girl and call her little sibling, and she would do that in reverse.\n Here's a chart I made with all the different pronouns: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1WGMQL-_9XU14HV8i4OgvW0fiPY50n4OUcoNOS0q8U/edit?usp=sharing\n I honestly think it's a fascinating system.

          "description": "I moved to a very multicultural city in a Western country and I'm in the process of finding a room to rent. I went check out this house this week and was shown around by this friendly vietnamese woman around my age in her 30s. There was a guy renovating the house who was also super friendly and chatty. I soon realized they were probably together despite the fact it was odd as he could pass as her dad. He's a local, not an immigrant. She has a kid too.\n So days go by when I haven't made up my mind so I send her a message asking if said room is still up for grabs. She says it's been taken. But then proceeds to send me a message saying One thing I want to say to you is you are really handsome and have such a beautiful smile. This followed by a cheerful/smiley emoji.\n Well, what the heck?\n Isn't this at best inappropriate considering she's likely with this other guy?

So he is living on an investor TRC & visa. 4 years ago, he had to renew his tourist visa once or twice by leaving Vietnam to Cambodia then entering Vietnam again.\n He now has trouble entering Vietnam as his entry date was on the old expired passport and he is holding his new passport. So at the Cambodia - Vietnam border, they didn't issue him the new visa for Vietnam. He went home, brought his old passport over and still they didn't issue him the visa because they couldn't find the stamp for his TRC on his passport. (what does this mean please help me explain this)\n He has to go to the HCM Immigration office for help. Now I have some questions:\n - Can a foreigner live in VN forever with just tourist visa? How many time can one leave and enter Vietnam on tourist visa? Can he do this for the rest of his life?\n - Can someone work remotely for a foreign country but want to live in Vietnam? What kind of paperwork he needs to be able to get a residence permit here?\n - How long an investor TRC last? Can one keep using his investor visa/TRC for multiple entries in Vietnam?\n - Can someone be a criminal (maybe not wanted) in their country or other country and can enter Vietnam without being recognized?\n - Can one commit a crime in the past and be able to apply for a job in Vietnam?\n - What kind of job can grant one a work permit? Does it have to be a full-time job?\n Is there any other possibility around this case where one won't be able to find a job in Vietnam, or not plan to but want to live in Vietnam? Is there any issue could hold one back from getting a job in Vietnam?\n    submitted by    /u/meiraki85  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a Wells Fargo Visa debit card and CitiBank MasterCard credit card; I am from the USA. I know most tourists pay in cash in Vietnam, but I am worried that my debit card won’t work at ATMs to withdraw cash. Unfortunately, I probably don’t have time to open a new debit card. \n In addition, I am not sure of how to book through apps like Booking.com, Hostelworld, Grab, 12go, etc. Grab doesn’t seem to accept my USA visa debit card. I have been able to book a couple hostels with my US card but unsure if it will work once I land in Vietnam. \n I predict I will spend $1-1.2k USD, but obviously don’t want to just carry that much cash to be converted to VND all at once.

          "description": "My partner and I will be traveling Vietnam next month (November 12th to 26th) for 15 days. I am thinking of exploring Hanoi, areas in the North, and not going any further south than perhaps Hoi An. We don’t want to rush too much so would prefer to stick to 3 to 4 places. I have some questions that I would appreciate some help with:\n  \nHa Giang: We would really love to do the loop on our own but are not experienced on motorbikes so can’t really make that happen. We aren’t into guided tours so wondering if there is an alternative way to enjoy Ha Giang without doing the loop. Trekking perhaps? We are experienced overnight trekkers and like big days such as 10-15 miles per day hiking. Is trekking a good alternative to motorbiking the loop in Ha Giang? If so, can we do this on our own or would we need a trekking guide? To add, we aren’t against hiring a private guide for certain things, especially if it allows us to learn more about the area, just aren’t into big group tours.\n Ninh Binh or Mai Chau: My partner gets sick on boats and we also don’t really like overrun places so considering skipping Ha Long Bay. Would you perhaps recommend Ninh Binh or Mai Chau as an alternative for a few days? If you could only go to one, which would it be?\n Phong Nha Ke Bang: I would really like to go here but I know November is the rainy season there. Is it still worth trying to go? Can you do trekking or some of the caves without a guide or are guides required? I was planning on not going further south than Hoi An but should we perhaps try to skip some of central Vietnam and try to see somewhere drier such as Dalat?\n These are the places I would like to see but won’t have time for everything. What would you recommend removing/adding? We enjoy physical activities such as trekking, cycling, nature, sleepy towns, good food, the ability to explore by bike.\n \n  \nHanoi\n Ha Giang\n Mai Chau\n Ninh Binh\n Phong Nha Ke Bang\n Hoi An\n Dalat\n \n Thanks so much in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/DragonfruitVivid3110  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Anglish is a thought experiment about what English would sound like if it had no loanwords from Latin, Greek, French, etc. Some examples are Uncleftish Beholding (\"Atomic Theory\" - all the scientific words which are borrowings from Latin/Greek are directly translated into English), and the Anglish Moot (an Anglish Wikipedia, basically).\n I'm intrigued (as a Vietnamese person) what Vietnamese would look like if we were to do something similar - no Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary, no French and English loanwords. Expressing scientific/modern concepts (and many everyday concepts as well - such as time; \"thời gian/时间\") without Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary would be very challenging, IMO - probably because Chinese has been influencing Vietnamese longer ago, and for a longer time, than Latin/Greek/French/Old Norse have been influencing English.\n From \"Uncleftish Beholding\", which calls an electron a \"bernstonebit\" (a calque of \"electron\", which comes from the Greek for \"amber\", \"amber\" being a loanword from Arabic by way of Old French), perhaps an electron could be \"chớp con\" (a calque of Chinese 电子; Sino-Vietnamese reading điện tử). Maybe a computer could be \"óc chớp\" (calque of Chinese 电脑). (Tính - all senses - is a Sino-Vietnamese word)\n Just to clarify: this is only a thought experiment by someone interested in languages.\n    submitted by    /u/LittleDhole  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nma hiện giờ gia đình tôi không ổn lắm, đang trên bờ vực li dị. Vì bố tôi hay đi uống, nhậu nhẹt về có lời lẽ quá đáng và xô xát với mẹ tôi.mẹ tôi không thích điều này nên hay cãi và lớn tiếng mỉa mai. Tất cả nguyên nhân của cuộc cãi vã là mẹ tôi cho \"bạn \" mượn 70 triệu không qua giấy tờ từ 8 năm trước đến bây giờ vẫn không trả đồng nào trong khi gia đình tôi hiện đang khó khăn vì chị tôi vừa lên đại học và cần nhiều thứ để chi. Và mẹ tôi còn mượn họ hàng tiền có kèm lãi, vòng tròn thiếu tiền =>mượn nợ=>trã tiền+lãi=> thiếu tiền xoay vòng liên tục khiến nhà tôi khó khăn hơn. Bố tôi cực kì bất mãn về việc này nên khi say hay dùng việc này để sỉ vã mẹ tôi. Khiến mẹ tôi không chịu nổi và muốn li dị, hiện tại đã viết giấy và chỉ cần ký và nộp toà là gia đình tôi đổ bể. Tôi đang đứng trước vấn đề muôn thuở của đề tài này \" con chọn theo ai?\" Thật sự thì tôi chả muốn họ li dị hay chọn theo ai cả, giờ tôi chả biết làm thế nào.

Yet, in Da Lat, this was flipped where barely 1 in 5 interactions were pleasant. This included drivers at Langbiang (a massive tourist trap, but anyway) literally running to their Jeeps and quickly driving away when asked for assistance, attendants being more pushy to payment than I've experienced elsewhere, rude staff, attendants etc., incredibly dangerous and aggressive motorcycle drivers, and shop attendants promising to help with postal/online orders than ignoring messages or giving one word replies to detailed questions (messaged in vietnamese) when followed up with. Along with your usual long stares from locals, attempted rots at tourist traps etc.\n Before people jump the gun with \"what do you expect in Vietnam/tourist place/being a forigner etc.\" I'm used to people in cities with lots of tourism being rude or just tired of the people who's income they rely on (Paris and Kyoto are notable examples), but what I experienced here was far beyond anything I have in other parts of Vietnam such as Da Nang, Hanoi or even HCMC.\n Is this something locals and other travellers have found?

          "description": "Just got into Ha Long (Bai Chay beach) last night. We are staying at a fairly nice hotel right off the beach in an area that is roughly six blocks squared. The area consists of only hotels, probably 60-80 establishments, of which only about 12 are open and active. Almost every other building, which is multi-stories and beautifully modern, is empty and dark with nothing inside the lobbies. There are maybe 3 cafes that might be open, and maybe 3 restaurants that offer 2-3 dishes each. \n There is literally NOBODY here. In the 48 hours we have been here, we have counted about 15 other tourists on both the beach and the hotel area. Aside from that, it is completely deserted. The wide streets have almost no traffic, with a car or two (mostly taxis) going past every 15 minutes or so. \n The closest place to buy beer/snacks/smokes is over a mile away. The beach itself had 2 other people on it until about 3 pm this afternoon. Everything is closed until about 4 when 1 place on the beach opened to sell beer and snacks. \n So what gives? We understand that it is off season right now and most tourists come November- March. But this place is completely deserted. It’s almost dystopian. We have been to other places throughout south east Asia during off season and nothing compares to how completely deserted this place is.

          "description": "Sorry if this question offended anyone, but I'm just genuinely curious. I can't understand why so many Vietnamese want to move to the US.\n I used to live in district 1, HCMC and there's insanely long line of people waiting at the US embassy basically everyday\n Basically all of the older people I know, and quite a few young people really like the US and want to move there.\n It's really far away, which makes flying back to visit family a huge pain. Things are also really expensive and it's getting rapidly worse. Immigration policy is strict, and it's even harder to get the green card to stay there.\n Not to mention the US has a lot of problems too. Just gonna mention 1: racism. I have heard a lot of stories about racism against Asian people in the US.\n I do think the US has quite a few things better than Vietnam, but if you can afford moving to the US then you can definitely afford moving to countless of other, much better countries. Even if just the English speaking ones, there are a few.\n My brother was obsessed with the US, moved there 8 years ago, worked really hard but still don't have green card. He is now starting to hate it and want to move to another country instead.\n My personal experience. I moved to the US and lived there for 1 year. I hated every second of it, my time there was horrible, and I was really depressed, even contemplated suicide a few times during my time there. Then I went back to Vietnam and my mood improved dramatically. After staying at home for a while I moved to Japan. Still living in Japan right now, and much happier than I ever was in the US.\n So what do you think? Please share your thoughts.\n Edit: The point of this post is not saying that Vietnam is better than living in the US. The point is why do Vietnamese people only care about and want to move to the US, while ignoring pretty much all other countries. Because if they can afford moving to the US, they can afford moving to those other countries\n    submitted by    /u/BadassMinh  \n [link]   [comments]",

Although I have not planned which agency or hostel I will be doing it with, I will definitely do it when I visit Vietnam in December!\n My question is, as amazing as it looks. There is one death road which does get me quite nervous. Its usually on day 2/3 which is just a narrow road with no gate and your basically at a cliff edge.\n My question is, are there any hostels which allow you to walk up this specific route? It's only a couple hundred meters but instead of being on a easy rider I would rather have much peace of mind walking up the route.\n Please let me know and any recommendations you may have!

Currently I believe there are 3 major parties; “Maobadi” (far left, militant), Communist Party of Nepal (left), and Congress (center left). However I think a lot of younger Nepali people are starting to lose faith in leftist ideology. I am 24 now, and I feel like more and more I am shifting more towards the left politically, socially, and morally. But since you’ve guys had one of the largest revolutionary movements in history. What do YOU guys feel about it, is what I want to know. To be honest I don’t even know much about the politics of Vietnam and it’s society. So any input is valuable.

So, if you've been to these places before, please let us know what you liked and didn't liked.\n First, we plan to spend a few days in Hanoi and then visit HaLong Bay from there. After that, we'll head to SaPa for 1-3 days. Then, we intend to continue our journey to Hoi An and wrap up our trip in Ho-Chi-Minh City. In total, we plan to spend 18 days in Vietnam. Should we change our destinations? Is there anything important we're missing?

          "description": "For a tropical country with quite a few uses for coconut, the coconut palm/fruit makes surprisingly few appearances in folklore that I am aware of. Sọ Dừa is the only well-known story (to my knowledge) where there is a strongish allusion to coconuts. \n Are there any origin stories for the coconut in Vietnamese folklore? I know that for example, many Polynesian cultures have stories about a giant eel who is beheaded and the first coconut palm grows from its head, explaining why coconuts look sort of like a face when you dehusk them.\n Or other folktales where coconuts/coconut palms play a significant role.\n Also, I've heard that coconuts with flesh/water that didn't develop properly are said to have been \"eaten by the moon \"(bị trăng ăn). I can't find any allusions to any other crops being eaten by the moon. Is there any specific mythology about why the moon eats coconuts?\n    submitted by    /u/LittleDhole  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m not joking. Serious question: do you guys give 70-90% of your income to your wife on monthly basis?\n I lived in Korea and Japan for 6 years and get married with a Korean woman speaking Vietnamese excellently. I often have conversations with Japanese and Korean male co workers and business partners. I swear they rarely do this. \n Since my wife and I settled down in Hanoi, she has hung out and done yoga with some Vietnamese women in the neighborhood. Then, she went home and dropped hints by telling stories like:\n “Our neighbor A’s husband sends her 90% of his monthly income, so she can manage finance of the family for him, buy what they need and do saving. He only keeps 15 mil for his personal use.”\n I know she will never directly ask me to do that. My wife is typical modern independent Korean woman having good income as professional Vietnamese-Korean translator. I keep my own money and she keeps her own money. We have a common bank account to which both of us send money for family expenses. My annual income = 5x her income, so I contribute much more. She is the person who came up with this idea, I totally agreed. She bought 70% of stuffs in our house.\n Yesterday, I saw a video on TikTok. That guy says his salary is automatically sent to his wife bank account by his company, and his wife would give enough amount of money for his living. I viewed the comments to his video, and it seems many people do this. I guess they were joking (not sure), but his video really raised my curiosity to ask this question. I am asking the same question on a Facebook group. Let’s see how many of us actually do this hehe. \n We are young family (30 husband and 28 wife). We may have the first kid next year, so a solid financial plan is a must.\n    submitted by    /u/MyNameIsYourMomName  \n [link]   [comments]",

When i Booked, The website was set as Vietnam English (Locationa and Language) and I made the transaction in VND through an International Card. But when I'm checking the same flight through Trip.com or Global USD Mode of the Website, The prices are doubled. Did i just got a sweet deal or made a huge mistake? Will it be a problem if a foreigner has a ticket booked from the Website in VND? Please Help if you have some information regarding this. \n Chào các bạn, tháng 12 mình sẽ về thăm Việt Nam và đặt vé máy bay Bamboo Airways đi Phú Quốc đi Hồ Chí Minh. Khi tôi đặt chỗ, trang web được đặt là tiếng Việt (Vị trí và ngôn ngữ) và tôi đã thực hiện giao dịch bằng VNĐ thông qua Thẻ quốc tế. Nhưng khi tôi kiểm tra cùng một chuyến bay thông qua Trip.com hoặc Chế độ USD toàn cầu của Trang web, Giá sẽ tăng gấp đôi. Tôi vừa có được một thỏa thuận ngọt ngào hay đã phạm một sai lầm lớn?

I just want to see her live and check on the concern scene.\n What I observed : \n The concert venue looks like an old gymnasium with pipes on the way inside the concert grounds which is unsafe since someone can trip over. \n But the stage and production value of the concert was superb. The stage has mulple large LED display panel, smoke effects and fire effects. There are orchestra situated in the back of large display panel. There is 3 or 4 different drones on the whole duration of the concert. And multiple cameras all over the place. \n The songs performed was on her album hoang and link and the encore song is an unreleased song together with the artist in Gieo Que. \n Most of the audience are singing along with the songs and they coordinatedly changing the color of their light sticks in the color of the LED display. \n I really enjoyed the arrangement of the songs in the last 5 songs since it has a live rock band feel specially with the drummers performance. \n About HTL performance though was underwhelming. Her voice feels to me is lipsynced (or maybe overprocessed?). There is no interaction with the audience and feels that it is a performance video and not a concert. I dont know if this a vietnamese thing since most of the concert i gone to has a least interaction to the fans / audience. \n Overall i enjoyed the concert despite some flaws.\n    submitted by    /u/djsensui  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think it is quite much for me (i am bread winner). I ask this question to see how people spend money on raising kids in Vietnam and get some insightful suggestions. I need to reduce expenses (around 30-40mil is perfect) but still give our daughter the best things.\n Kindergarten Tuition: 15 mil\n Babysitter: 8 mil\n Child food and supplements: 12 mil \n Child care product: 2 mil\n Clothes: 2 mil (she’s growing fast)\n Sport and entertainment: 3 mil\n Language education (English and Belarusian): 10 mil.

You have to press spacebar when you see a potentially dangerous action. There's a set time limit in which you have to mash the button, and you'll be graded anywhere from 0-5 depending on when you do it.\n Already this sounds like a horrible idea, knowing that there's heavy implication that your intuition can fuck right off and this is strictly a memorize-and-answer kind of test. You can see the sitch and press spacebar ZERO POINT ONE SECOND EARLY and it will be a wrong answer.\n WHO THE FUCK IN THEIR RIGHT MIND THINKS IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO FORCE FEED THIS SORT OF HORSESHIT INTO PEOPLE'S HEADS AND CALL IT A \"TEST\"???\n Apparently the Ministry of Traffic and Transports, with their infinite fucking wisdom, alongside whoever ratify the change, do.\n And the tragedy is, it's unlikely that this will be revoked, so anyone (including me) who thinks of getting a driver's license now can either suck it up or go fuck themselves.\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/DerGottbrecher  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, the idea of a more relaxed, less touristy experience in Hoi An is appealing.\n I have six days and five nights, factoring in day trips to nearby places and wanting to immerse myself in local life, so I can't visit both cities at the same time.

          "description": "Hi everyone! I just booked my honeymoon in Vietnam for Nov. 24-December 8th. Would love any suggestions on the itinerary below:\n November 24-26th: Hanoi November 27th: Bai Tu Long Cruise (2 day/ 1 night) November 28th: Hanoi (to rest after the cruise & leave for Sa Pa early the next day) November 29th-December 2nd: Sa Pa December 2nd-6th: Hoi An/ An Bang Beach December 7th: last night in Hanoi before we fly out \n I just had a few questions: 1. Firstly, I read that it’s the very end of the rainy season in Hoi A during early December. Do you think it’s still worth going and risking the rain, or would it be better to choose somewhere else? We want at least one relaxing beach time and also really wanted to see Hoi An. I also read it can be beautiful around Christmas. Is it worth it? Worried about being rained out the whole time but hoping if it’s at the end it might be okay. 2. Is Bai Tu Long bay as beautiful as Halong Bay? Worth it to book Bai Tu Long instead? 3. We’re planning on booking the EcoSapa limousine buses to/from Sapa and Hanoi. Are these a good choice?\n Any other recs/thoughts would be greatly appreciated (especially for a honeymoon vibe)! Thanks so much in advance ❤️\n    submitted by    /u/sundayglow  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought I was lucky to find a job at a tech company with an \"ok\" salary (1000usd gross). Turned out the company is exploitative and management is extremely toxic and abusive. So back to the grind to find a job for the last couple of months. \n Why are companies trying to tell us Gen Zs as unstable and indecisive in our careers when in reality, we're (or most friends I know) just trying so hard to find a DECENT job where we can stick around for stability without being exploited to the point of mentally suffering to get by?\n Some recruiters even told me that my salary expectation was too high :) My expectation is 20-25M net/month?? Mind you, I have 4 years of experience, fluent at English and graduated from a top university in Aus. I know it largely depends on the job, industries... but it's affected my self-esteem somewhat. \n If you're a young native Vnese are you going through the same thing?\n If not, please teach me how to sniff out the bad companies and find ones that pay you you're worth?? Open to discuss further\n Edit: I live in HCM, the most expensive city in this country so my expected salary is just enough for me to pay rent, groceries, have very fundamental household needs fulfilled and left with around 2-3mil extra to save.

          "description": "I moved to Vietnam this year about six months ago. Almost right on cue, I started to have stomach problems, mainly in the form of diarrhea. Curiously, aside from two particularly awful days, it rarely manifests as outright food poisoning where it affects me the whole day. Rather I'll get \"you have 30 seconds to comply\" situations. Cafe sua especially has a tendency to cause this roughly 1/4 of the time, so I just avoid it now.\n If I cook at home or eat more expensive foreign cuisine like Korean or Japanese food, the problem alleviates and my bowels actually become normal. However, if I go out to eat Vietnamese food (even at busy restaurants with high turnover) or drink cafe coffee (including even some supposedly safe looking coffee shops like Cafe Amazon), it's only a matter of time before things rear their ugly head again. Most of the time, I'll be fine, but I feel like a bout or two of diarrhea (but not out and out food poisoning, I never throw up or feel nauseous) every two weeks isn't normal. It feels like a shame to not feel comfortable eating the local food due to these issues. \n I have never had these issues before, and the timing from my arrival here (as well as its alleviation when i switch to home cooking only) is quite conspicuous. From what I hear, travelers diarrhea is supposed to resolve within a few weeks, not six months. Has anyone else experienced these issues?

          "description": "Recently there was a video of a teacher bullying a student. The reason is because that student didn't buy desserts from the bakery the teacher told her to buy. And then later the headmaster of that school wants to punish the student who upload the video. They are trying to cover their wrong doing and warn others not to publish the evidence to save the school's face. \n Vụ này ở VN mấy ngày nay nổi rầm rầm chắc ai cũng biết. Vấn đề là mình cảm thấy những vụ liên quan đến bạo lực học đường, dù là do giáo viên hay học sinh bắt nạt lẫn nhau, đều bị nhà trường hoặc cố giấu nhẹm hoặc là lờ đi không hề nhắc đến, có vụ nữ sinh tự tử do bị bắt nạt quá đà mà nhà trường biết nhưng cố tình ép nữ sinh đi học để bị bắt nạt tiếp, trong khi đó không hề đứng ra xử lý gì việc bắt nạt. \n Cái này rõ ràng ai sống ở VN đều biết là để giữ điểm thành tích, thanh danh cho nhà trường. \n Nghĩ ai còn đang đi học với ai có con cái còn đi học sẽ thấy thế nào, hoặc là bị bắt nạt rồi đến mức phải chuyển trường, thành vết sẹo tâm lý, trong khi đó không ai bênh vực cả. Nếu ko có những clip bằng chứng như vậy ai sẽ biết đến vụ việc bị bắt nạt? Mà giờ còn phạt cả những ai dám nói, dám đưa clip lên nữa.\n Các bạn nghĩ sao về vụ này?\n    submitted by    /u/sophiereadingabook  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here I will answer how to get the vat refund. When you buy any item in Vietnam. Costly items like electronics, phone, camera etx. The shop needs to fill up the customs declaration form. It will mention your passport details. Entry exit date, expiry date etc. You can claim the vat refund only if you are on a tourist visa, exiting the country. At the airport, you need to go to the customs office. At Hanoi airportz it's little tricky. The security, police don't understand English. I asked 4 people. They could not answer. Information desk could not explain me even after I showed the translator. Eventually I found out the customs office. \n I presented the customs declaration form to the officer. He took 2-3 minutes to verify it and forwarded to a clerk of MSB bank who was sitting at the next counter. She asked me to sign couple of forms. Then provided me 85% of the total vat. She paid me in cash USD. Entire process took 10 minutes. That's all.\n    submitted by    /u/here4geld  \n [link]   [comments]",

They sent an email for a physical interview that is set for this weekend, in the meanwhile they did this \"online prequalification\" that has to go through Telegram.\n The first part of this bullcrap is an MBTI test(?) that contains only like 5 questions. Am I that out of touched to the HR world that MBTI is a standard thing now?\n The second part is the relatively well-known scam that has been floating around recently, which is inputting data and get money from a lottery platform, all in the guys of \"making extra revenue\". First they sent me 150k to add to the platform, so I played along for a bit, got 330k in return. They seems to be impressed that they started telling me about the 4 tiers of data entry, which basically is an ever increasing amount of money in return for a (supposedly) even higher amount. Of course that first run was a trial period, the 2nd run will be a 40-60 shares of profit for the company. And on top of it, the lowest tier they put up is 600k, which is just above the amount that I just earned, which means I have to pour money out of my own pocket for them.\n Here's where I cut things off. This is too many red flags with screaming horns in my head. No fucking way a company would take money from their applicants. The funniest thing is that they even have the audacity to breath out that sentence I screenshotted above. I guess taking 330k from them is not much but it still filled my pettiness with something close to pride.\n So tl;dr: I have an encounter with a scam group that masquerading as a legit company.

My favorite one is Gopchang (grilled pork and beef intestines)\n I asked bf, but he said it’s not popular. I guess he just wants me to persuade me to cook another dishes, because he can not eat intestines 😚😙😗\n If you guys eat intestines, what is your favorite type of cooking? In Korea, we often do barbecue (grill). Are there any Korean dishes, which Vietnamese people love? I’m willing to learn and cook for them\n Last time, I asked “how to impress viet parents” in this sub. Your suggestions helped me a lot, and I was successful.

I know we have dimsum here too but it’s still thought of as a Chinese food, or đồ Hoa.\n So my question is, do Vietnamese Americans have dim sum for lunch that often too?

My dad has 13 other siblings most of which live in America as well, and for whatever reason it’s like every week they pick and choose whether to treat me, my mom, and my dad like shit or not. it’s like a sick ranking! it’s horrible. especially after my dad died and they barely cared, he died in a horrible car accident too, and yet we barely get any phone calls, much less any sympathy at all from them. it’s been 10 months now that he’s gone and yet they always gossip, body-shame, manipulative, clout-chase, and make me and my mom feel horrible! and we didn’t even do anything… my mom is vietnamese too and she’s the sweetest person ever. just, why? why are they so mean? is it because they are vietnamese? or jealous? what’s going on? i always feel like i’m doing something wrong, like i’m actually too pu**y, but heck am i gonna say to them, i don’t like ur 30 LV bags?\n    submitted by    /u/Academic-Juggernaut5  \n [link]   [comments]",

Initially, my father didn't want any part of me when my mother got pregnant because I was an accident. He impregnated my mom when he was 25, and she was 15. Before I was born, he tried to persuade my mom to have an abortion. I met him for the first time at the age of 5 and then reconnected with the family at the age of 12. My stepmom is mostly the reason why I wasn't around, as my father lied to her and never disclosed my existence until my mom basically gave him an ultimatum to accept me as his son. If he didn't, she would take him to court for child support, which she did, and he paid until I turned 18. My stepmom is also the reason I re-entered the family …",

Meanwhile he expects me to do a master’s degree and work full time as well. He teaches me things like: - It’s fine for men to have a high body count before marriage but girls should keep themselves pure - It’s a woman’s job to do the cooking, cleaning, etc. (including things like having to cut my husband’s finger and toe nails) - I shouldn’t do a doctor’s degree because men are deterred from women with higher education - It’s justified if my husband cheats if I don’t provide him with a warm meal and children\n My mother works full time as well but he feels entitled to everything she does for him. If there’s no food or the food is too salty for example, he starts to shout and says “without me, you would be living in the streets.”\n Is that normal for our Vietnamese culture?

We’ll move to vn in February next year. I am happy she’s willing to follow me. But I’m worried that she may struggle to adapt to living and workenvironment in Vietnam.\n As a foreigner living vn, what were your difficulties in living and working? Esp female foreigners (female and male may have different concerns). How did you overcome them?\n What can I do to help her go through tough time? She doesn’t need to worry about money, living place. We only care how she can get a good job, have positive experience and avoid being culture shocked or anxious\n She wants to learn the language. Can you suggest any language centers or tutors teaching foreigners Vietnamese?\n Any Vietnamese or foreigner having the same situation here, can you share your experience? I appreciate all your suggestions!!!!\n You may wonder why I don’t stay in Canada. I actually got PR of Canada. I am working for an American firm. The company is building a new factory in a north province of vietnam. I was chosen to work as one of managers in that factory, because I can speak the language. I will work in my home country like “expat” 😂😂. This is also a good chance for me to make a big chunk of money.😁\n    submitted by    /u/Wrong_Neck2992  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some of my questions and concerns needing answers from travelers who have been there: -Visa. I believe visitors will need a visa to enter. Could anyone share the link to apply for the visa application? Can it be an online application, how much and how long to get the visa. -Money to get around. Are credit cards accepted or only cash? -Wifi access. Would getting a local SIM to access the internet be the best way? Do the Vietnamese telcos offer inexpensive prepaid SIMs and roughly how much? -Must sees and do's in Ho Chi Minh. Recommended places of interest to see and unique experiences would be great. -Souvenirs. What's good to bring home from Vietnam? I would appreciate your practical tips and suggestions.

The communities are strong and supportive. The people are kind, welcoming, and patient. There is one thing that drives me crazy though. I routinely find the process of asking a question and receiving a response from Vietnamese people to be painful. The same goes for politely declining invitations. I say no politely time after time after time and it doesn't seem like anyone hears me unless I get animated, frustrated, exasperated, or leave. The same goes for answering questions.

          "description": "Hello, \n As the title says, I got an offer from ILA for Can Tho! On the surface, things sound pretty decent, especially since they offer a housing allowance. \n My pay according to the contract (before taxes) is 473,000 VND an hour (20 teaching hours a week), on top of a housing allowance of 7,000,000 VND per month. It's a standard 12-month contract. \n My main priorities are to learn how to be a good teacher, save as much as I can, and try to avoid stress as much as possible. That being said, I want to make sure ILA is a good fit for me. I don't mind the region I'm staying in (Can Tho) since I doubt I'm gonna leave my apartment much... for me, the priority is just learning a local culture and saving money. \n Does anyone have any experiences with ILA that they'd be willing to share? I understand that avoiding stress is impossible as a teacher, but I just want to make sure that they've got a good support system in place. The last thing I want is to be overworked or overwhelmed with stuff that they didn't mention in the interview or the contract... only to realize I could've had that same experience here, in the states. \n Long story shrot, this is the only offer I think I'll be getting from Vietnam... and I'm stuck between taking it and just giving up and sticking to living in the states. I don't want to go overseas and get burned out on teaching since I'm gonna be doing that for a living... \n Please let me know, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Uncanny_Hero  \n [link]   [comments]",

More specifically, for someone who speaks Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese (has Italian and Brazilian citizenship), and who has work experience in programming, IT, and graphic design, and also has \"uncertified\" skills in construction and furniture building? \n I know that being a Digital Nomad or working remotely for a European country are obvious answers, but I'm wondering about on-the-ground, potentially Visa-sponsored gigs? I do not yet live in Vietnam, so when I search on my Dell from the USA, even if I search in Spanish (my second language), my results are highly skewed and unhelpful.\n If anyone has links, knows of good recruiting companies, or anything, I'd greatly appreciate it! Equally, if the answer is that my friend would be SOL, thank you for the frankness 😅\n    submitted by    /u/kdescieux  \n [link]   [comments]",
