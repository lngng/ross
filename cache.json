          "description": "Hi guys, long time lurker with my first post. \n Basically I wanted to ask for some feedback. As this is the first Tet i have spent in Hanoi with my wifes family. Her family are generally relaxed and cool, we do get on well even with the language barrier. The issue is, my wife's brother is a city cop and when he is around, the atmosphere tenses up a lot. it becomes very uncomfortable and the air gets heavy. \n So, the Tet festivities are going smoothly but whenever he is around, it just becomes tense and no one wants to talk. Then yesterday happened. he got super drunk at a neighbours Tet meal, he drove back to the family house, continues drinking and smoking in the house at night(while there are young kids sleeping).\n It all comes to a boiling point, throwing shit, shouting, all around being a childish git. Basically the gist of his misery is that, I have ruined his career as a police officer because I am a foreigner and I have married his sister. He will never be eligible for promotions or a climb up the (greasy) ladder. So the solution is to divorce my wife so he can be promoted at work ??? I mean, from my european perspective this seems completely bonkers. Is this a common issue. I know police officers are tightly monitored, not able to travel abroad etc.. but this is insane. \n Honestly a bit lost for words, I have told the wife that I won't participate in any family gatherings. We can meet at my house or in the city but i will not go to the hometown. Am i overeacting ?\n Keen to hear your thoughts \n Chuc Mung Nam Moi \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Total-Conference-292  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’re travelling the whole length of the country, north, central and south. Love lots of outdoor trips, food, exploring, hot weather, adventures, scuba diving (would be nice to work this in if possible)\n We’re getting married in August, so are looking at taking the trip some time between September and November. \n Now down to the old weather dilemma… What’s everyone’s experience with travelling across Vietnam during those times? I know there’s different climates in each region, so we’re trying to work out the best month that has the best weather balance, so we can experience and enjoy all regions. When would you recommend going? September, October or November? We are not relaxing on the beach people, so would be okay with the occasional downpour…As long as we can get the most out of our time there!\n Also, if anyone has scuba dived during those times, would be great to hear the best spots for this time of year 😁😁\n    submitted by    /u/Discendo-Discimus7  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The restaurant's name was Kieu Giang. For the record, 80k was just the base price of the dish itself, which is broken rice with pork chop & egg paste. I had to pay 30k for a bowl of purple sweet potato soup, another 15k for a small bowl of extra rice with half the size of the soup bowl, 8k for iced tea, and 10% of service fee, totaling up to around 150k VND (roughly $6) for the whole meal.\n And goodness me, the dish was bloody delicious. Probably one of the best bloken rice dish I 've ever eaten. The fish sauce was so good, that I could probably eat 2 plates only with rice and fish sauce alone. The pork rib was pretty damn tender, like it almost melted in your mouth.\n And so, did it worth 150k VND? Honestly, I don't know either. For foreigners, $6 is pretty acceptable, but for Vietnamese, ehh, might be too expensive. Was it tasty? Huge yes. Does it give the best bang for a buck? I don't think so. There are many restaurants that have the same dish for half, even 1/3 the price, but the flavor is still very solid. But still, I thoroughly recommend anyone to try the dish if you are looking for the best possible broken rice restaurant.\n Reminder: I asked them about the price, and they told me that they offer the same price even on non-holidays. So whether it's Tet's holiday or not, the price is still the same.\n    submitted by    /u/Several-Foundation93  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is my second winter in Vietnam and overall I've had a great time. That said, this year's trip has made me rethink future plans due to the worsening air quality. After two months here (HCMC) last year, I noticed that my throat and eyes were always irritated. Now, after another three months here this year, it is a daily occurrence again. However, having just returned from a couple of weeks up North, I can tell you that I can literally see and smell the end of Vietnam's growth, at least as far as tourism goes. \n Ha Noi was an environmental disaster and I literally couldn't wait to get out of there. Even Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh had air quality issues. I have no data to go on, but I think air quality alone in Vietnam would shorten a person's life by several years just by living here. \n I read a view articles on the government \"initiatives\" to address environmental issues, but I didn't read anything that would result in near-term practical remediation. Further, given my own experiences over the last couple of years, the Gov can pass whatever laws they want, but the likelihood of them being consistently enforced is doubtful.\n In short, I have really enjoyed my time in Vietnam and have come to love the culture, people, and food, but I simply cannot foresee returning. Although the hype of Vietnam as a great winter destination may continue for a few more years, I truly believe that their worsening pollution/environmental situation will eventually lead to greater economic stagnation.\n Please, please prove me wrong, Vietnam!\n    submitted by    /u/RTLisSB  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is complete bs. I've been to the countryside on and off, and almost all old stranger I came across had been nothing but pleasant. They'd teach me how to do things and tell me fascinating war stories. It's actually young people that often scream loudly and piss off people.

However, amidst the breathtaking landscapes and chill vibes, we encountered a disheartening experience that compelled me to share a cautionary tale with fellow travelers.\n One evening, eager to indulge in Sapa's renowned cuisine, we decided to try the sturgeon hotpot at a local restaurant. The food was delectable, and it was our first time savoring sturgeon—a memorable experience indeed. But what followed left a bitter taste in our mouths. \n Upon requesting the bill, we were handed a piece of paper detailing our total: 1,085,000 VND. …",

          "description": "Hello, \n We are in early planning stages of a trip to Vietnam later this year. We’ll have a little over 2 weeks. Our biggest problem is trying to fit in too much on one trip. With that being said, we aren’t really relaxing vacationers. We’re more about exploring as much as possible, usually ok with being on the go go go, seeing as much of the history and culture, food and people and lifestyle etc, as possible. This is typically how we travel and never end up regretting it. I’ve read a lot of articles that say to not attempt the north and south in one trip and focus on one area. Of course, we’d like to start/end in HCMC or Hanoi, and go either north/south from whichever we fly in and out of, and see a bit of everything in each area and in between. Has anyone done north and south in this timeframe ? Was it worth it ? Also I’m a little newer to Reddit so I am open to different groups or subs if this is not the best spot. Thanks in advance :)\n    submitted by    /u/lights-camera2  \n [link]   [comments]",

But than I thought, yeah, you would have to make sure it is by force and culturally integrated, because who in the right mind would hang out with a Me always first thinker, if not for influence, money or some other benefits, not forgetting that the majority of the same age group have the same thinking pattern.\n My mother still wonders why I am so cold to her, I explained it enough times, but she doesn't listen, she finds fault in my thinking (why the heck to you even ask if you don't intend to listen? Just leave me the fuck alone, I have really a hundred better things to do)\n I lived a few years in VN, and there were some people that made it a point to seem like the would help others, just to brag about it. That's ok,you do you I do me.\n But the balant interfering in the lives of their younger is just insane. And that I saw in like 70-90% of all the over 60 folks over there?\n Let them live, yeah, give them advice if asked or if you see them struggle do it unasked for all I care. But don't expect them to do as you command and try manipulate them with your pregnancy and all your sacrifice. You sacrifice of your own believe, not to guilt trip someone afterwards. Suck it up.\n I fully understand why most of VNs my age turn narcissist themself, have a alcohol/drug abuse problem or cut contact fully.\n What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/QuestionMaleficent  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is not an isolated phenomenon as multiple banks across the spectrum experience this issue. (digital bank, domestic bank and foreign bank)\n There are only 2 payment rails for interbank transfers in Vietnam.\n  \nCITAD: There is no doubt the standard transfer is unavailable during Lunar New Year in Vietnam because it is fundamentally a manual payment system even if some banks modernized it with digitalization to bring on some level of automation.\n NAPAS: I am wondering if the instant payment network is disabled during Lunar New Year. When I successfully make a NAPAS transfer, many banks return me a success screen with a norm-divergent message along the line \"We have received your transfer request.\" rather than \"Your transfer is successfully completed.\", one bank explicitly wrote the NAPAS transfer will be relegated to CITAD transfer while another bank recorded a future transaction date of 15 February 2024. However, I can't find any official notice or announcement about the service outage, whether planned or unplanned.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/abc_abc_abc-  \n [link]   [comments]",

With a rather dysfunctional family at that.\n The day's been nice - We went to my grandparents, had meals, played games.. etc. My dad who is a notorious prideful piece of shit of course got himself incredibly drunk. He has a habit of blowing up over small things / getting stupidly violent like most vietnamese men with some drops of alcohol. Currently trying to assault the neighbor against like 8 family members' protest. He drove off with his weapons, we were not able to stop him. I fear the worst\n calling the police isnt an option because he hadnt done anything and if I try to stop or chase after him, hes going to hit me (he already had.) Im in a state of extreme stress rn and i need to know if theres anything i can do as no one is willing to do anything anymore. i do not have friends or people i can trust.\n Update: We got a call from my aunt. The police found him and apparently theyre working with grandparent's side for things. That's all I know (i'm not allowed to contact them per my mom's request to \"stay out of it\")\n Update 2 (currently 8pm): the police had let him off, i think. Idk if anyone is hurt. He came home being all friendly again like nothing happened and went to sleep. They have confiscated his weapon. Its a machete of some kind - I know its been in our family for some time, stored above the tall cabinet (I wasnt allowed to go near it growing up) They put it elsewhere at some point and I had no idea he was still in posession of the machete until rn. I dont know if he'll be fined for the weapon.

But many posts regarding the positives of Vietnan seem to involve the cheapness of food/products/services, claiming how everything cheap it is. Usually these post are people who live outside Vietnam that makes good money that spend lavishly due to the conversion rate of USD/Euros to VND giving you lots of VND (I am guilty to admit that I also spent lavishly during my time in Vietnam even with my $14/hr part time job).

          "description": "I am traveling to Vietnam at the end of the month. We will be doing the Ha Giang loop, then visiting Hoi An/Danang, the finally Hue (our first two days and last day will be in Ho Chi Minh City). I have some questions regarding gifts and donations during my travels. 1. The main thing I am looking forward to doing is visiting Temples. I would like to bring some small gifts and/or donations when I visit. I plan on bringing fruit, but I was wondering if a small cash donation is something I can do? My boss is from Vietnam (I am American) and I would like to bring something to them in her and her families honor, as well as give my own offering and thanks. Any advice on amount would be helpful. Also, If anyone has some Temple recommendations, I’d appreciate them. 2. My coworkers father has a hotel in Hue, and we will be staying there for two days. He is also having some friends take us to a few places for sightseeing. Id like some advice on a thank you gift for his father and friends. 3. Best way to travel from Hoi An to Danang? We were advised to stay in Hoi An over Danang, but I’d like to spend a day or two exploring here. Best way to do about that? 4. Best travel method from Hoi An to Hue. \n Thank you for any advice, it is appreciated🙏🏻\n    submitted by    /u/ALH1984  \n [link]   [comments]",

The friend whom I was traveling with is vegan so we tried out lots of chay places. My mind was blown, it was some of the best food I’ve ever had, specifically the best meat replacements I’ve ever had!!! \n It was always so juicy, tender, just the right amount of spices and marinated in delicious but not overpowering sauces, so fresh! \n A year later im still dreaming about this stuff. I decided to google some recipes but I’ve not had much luck. Does anyone have recipe recommendations or can tell me the secret to this magic? \n Some of it was definitely tofu but I’m not so sure about other ones - maybe seitan? But HOW did they make it so good?? \n I hope someone knows what I’m talking about. Here are links to the best restaurants I tried, highly recommended! \n Sa Pa: Hoa Tâm vegetarian restaurant Nhà Hàng Chay Hoa Tâm \n https://maps.app.goo.gl/dXhy5FENowUgWDTK8?g_st=ic \n Da Nang: Passionate heart Ẩm Thực Chay Thiện Tâm \n https://maps.app.goo.gl/ueNm59mArJBHm3xW7?g_st=ic\n Hoi an: Awesome buffet style where you can put together your own meal, went here for breakfast WOW!! Ba Dam Vegetarian Restaurant Quán Chay Đạm ( Bà Đạm vegetarian cafe ) \n https://maps.app.goo.gl/cC42Tab3TvaPbvz28?g_st=ic\n Da Nang, here we had a kind of fake chicken, the meat replacement (tofu?

We are excited to start our tour in the Summer of 2024 and are looking at potential destinations.\n We are trying to find cool venues, something like an old church or an old theater, with seating capacity from 50-150 guests. An old abandoned building, barn, field, or cemetery would also be cool, if available. We’d like to make a documentary about the tour, so we prefer cinematic places over traditional rock clubs.\n It's hard to do this kind of search on google, so I figured it's best to ask here, since I will be doing the majority of planning for the tour.\n One last thing, if you guys have any recs on local poster artists, please tag their IG's or names. Food and off-the-beaten track sites are also much appreciated. Especially places pertaining to local music history.\n Hope to hear some great suggestions, and thank you in advance,\n Raven and the Dark Shadows\n https://open.spotify.com/artist/1cfkjku9heWFJn4E7qqNUC?si=Qpyax3siQiOBfcPg_aHAyg\n    submitted by    /u/Dependent_Carob9014  \n [link]   [comments]",

I watched as they went up the street and gave another homeless man a red bag gift as well. \n Less than 1 min later, another bike pulled up, and they handed a food box and bottle of water to the homeless lady. \n This I was able to capture on video. \n I was astounded by these selfless acts of positivity. \n Wife and I got to McDonald’s, had dinner, and were walking back the same road, and saw a 3rd person, handing out red pockets to these same homeless folks. \n I was shocked. 3 selfless acts, not even looking for praise, all within 30minutes. \n I hope this warms your hearts and gives you hope that Vietnamese society has its positive side. \n As Mr Rogers said, look for the helpers.\n    submitted by    /u/aktionmancer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would prefer to somewhat keep it fully anonymous we can use code names. Help me learn the language.....\n    submitted by    /u/Longjumping-Egg-7472  \n [link]   [comments]",

We will be doing HCMC, Hoi An, Hue, then I was initially thinking Hanoi for 1 night in order to get the transfer to Halong for the cruise. Then after the cruise, three nights in Hanoi to further explore properly before flying home. But the transfer to Halong from hanoi seems quite long, and as we will be returning after the cruise anyway, would it make more sense to stay nearer Halong Bay port for the night before the cruise? That way we only have to do one leg of the three hour transfer (way home). Can't find a lot of into about this, what part of halong city area or nearby is best to stay? even a 30 min transfer is better than 3 hours. \n Thanks\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Flutterbyx303  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's the occasion for people to forgive, to care, and to be gerenous. And loud music! 😀\n  \nMost people go to their hometowns during Tet. Not being able to meet the parents during Tet is unfortunate and sad.\n \nBusinesses closed during Tet, except for hotels and some restaurants. People aren't supposed to work during Tet. Restaurants apply 10-30% surcharge during this time, as they have to pay 3x the wages to the workers working during Tet. So if you have to pay 30% more (for food, taxi, services...) than usual price, don't think they rob you…",

We've been using approved agents for all the different processes required for my transition to Vietnam. I'll be picking up my TRC tomorrow from the agent but this is a picture they sent letting me know it's ready. I'll be asking the agent these questions as well but I figured I'd ask here too.\n  \nIs this correct TRC for a spouse? When we first started the process the agent kept suggesting another type of visa or TRC that required me to leave every six months or something. I don't know why, we explained that we are married and I will be living in VN. I think we communicated this clearly but sometimes communication is difficult, my Vietnamese is limited, my wife speaks English but sometimes things get lost in translation. \n \nIs the TRC linked to a Visa or IS the TRC the visa? I came on a 90 day evisa at the beginning of January, so I still have until 4 April left on it, but now that I have a TRC has it been changed automatically? Do I have to do anything in that regard? \n \nDo I need to leave and re-enter VN to \"activate\" it? I read somewhere that once approved and the TRC was received that the person had to leave and re-enter to \"change over their visa\". I asked the agent about this and they assured me that I DO NOT need to do this or go anywhere, which surprised me.\n \n Anyways, thanks for any insight you can offer, it can be confusing at times as I'm aware that polices can change often, dealing with bureaucracy can be tedious and middlemen aren't always very clear.\n    submitted by    /u/Leading_Fun_3080  \n [link]   [comments]",

I get that it feels comfortable and safe to only talk to people of your own group but they cant participate in normal American society without help from my wife or her cousin of the same age. I have learned more vietnamese in the 5 years we have been together than some of them have learned english in 20 years here.

I have heard so much conflicting information from sources online, and some sources told me only an FBI check is acceptable, but others said a local background check is sufficient.\n My biggest issue is time, since it has taken 6 months for my university to send me a hardcopy of my degree, and I wouldn't want to have to wait around much longer for an in-depth background check if this local background check I have already obtained will be accepted. So I would like to know your experiences.\n I'm from the state of Florida, and the background check is for my home county here in Florida.

          "description": "Vietnamese American here. Does anyone else's parents compare them to their friends kids? It almost feels like they wish I was something I'm not or wish they could trade me for someone else. At some point in your life, you have to decide whether you want to live on your own terms or live on your parents terms. The latter will destroy every bit of your sanity and make you lose sight of what truly makes you happy. It is completely okay to disappoint your parents and go against the grain of what traditions they believe to be true. I truly appreciate everything they have done for me, but the unrealistic expectations they have set out for me will unfortunately never be met, and if they ever do get met, it won't be on their terms. The unfortunate truth is you won't be able to please everybody in your life, not even your own family, so the best thing you can do is to live for yourself.

Có lần bạn kể cho mình về việc thất tình ( lúc chưa yêu nhau ) là bạn ấy đơn phương 8 năm người bạn thân khác giới của bạn ấy, tỏ tình nhưng bị từ chối,…. Kể nhiều quá lỡ bị lộ:)) Khoảng 1 tháng sau khi quen thì mình có tỏ tình và bạn ấy có suy nghĩ các kiểu, sau một hồi bạn ấy đồng ý. Mình có yêu cầu công khai nhưng bạn ấy không đồng ý do sợ mn chê bạn ấy. Trong khi mấy ngày mình bận học, một hôm mình vào discord thấy bạn ấy đặt avt đôi với bạn thân khác giới của bạn ấy ( do có kết bạn với cả 2 người). Mình để im khoảng 1 tuần vẫn nói chuyện bình thường thì thấy bạn ấy k nói gì về việc avt cả kiểu mình cũng hơi buồn buồn á, mình hỏi thì bạn ấy chối:)) nên mình cũng k vạch trần nó ra. Mà bạn thân khác giới của nyc mình cũng có ny rồi. Nyc mình còn không bao giờ chủ động với mình á:((. Lúc đồng ý yêu nhau rồi thì vẫn xưng hô là ông-bà- tôi kiểu vậy á. Nma bạn ấy cứ nói là sợ lộ:((( Mình yêu nhau với bạn ấy tầm gần 1 tháng, sắp noel thì mình đề nghị chia tay, bạn ấy đồng ý rồi mình block, sau đấy bạn ấy liên tục làm phiền mình, quay lại các kiểu xong k được rồi chửi mình. Xong còn nói xấu mình với hội anh em của bạn ấy nma là nói sai sự thật á, kêu mình ngu thích thể hiện, trẻ con,… Còn về mình học là có thật, mình học nhiều đến nỗi không có thời gian để yêu, để nhớ đến bạn ấy. Mình có chia sẻ với một số bạn thì một số bạn thì mình bị chửi mình quá trời, mình cũng thấy khá tủi thân á;-; Ảnh là bằng chứng mình học thật nha, có thể mình nhỏ tuổi hơn mà xưng hộ vậy thì cho mình xin lỗi ạ.\n    submitted by    /u/Responsible-Equal-77  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have decided to travel from Da Nang to Hoi A tomorrow using a Grab car because it costs just under $15 for a one-way trip, which seems like a great deal. My plan is to stay in Hoi A for 2 or 3 nights and then return to Da Nang city on the 8th or 9th, which coincides with the start of Tet. I am a bit concerned that it might be challenging to find available cars for the return trip to Da Nang during that time, or there might be a significant surcharge on Grab cars on the 8th or 9th. Does anyone have insights on what it might be like and any suggestions? Thank you so much.\n    submitted by    /u/Hour_Tip8433  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are the celebrations that happen? Or would it be better to move onto my next country (Malaysia) earlier than planned so there won't be much to do in Ho Chi Minh? \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/areyouproudma  \n [link]   [comments]",

My sister and mom and I saw so many women wearing really pretty Ao Dais and we decided to buy our own. They came without the pants so we decided to wear long black wide leg dress pants as a substitute. \n This Friday I’m going to California adventure to attend the lunar new year festival (I’m a pass holder and I want to try the drinks and food pass they have). I want to wear the ao dais to the festival inside the theme park but I’m scared of appropriating or offending Vietnamese culture. \n I’ve also read and learned how the dress is respectful for Vietnamese women, and that the dress suits the slender body of many Vietnamese women. I’m Filipino and we have our own traditional clothing but we don’t really participate in lunar new year. \n I’d love any insight or opinions and if there’s a line I’m crossing I’ll keep my ao dai for my personal collection to have.

The owners are Vietnamese Catholics who invited us to go to a church service with them, which is very kind of them. I think we’ll be included in other things, but I’m fairly sure their weekend is going to be pretty mellow. What can we bring as a gift? We will be traveling from Phnom Penh by boat the day we meet up with them. I do not know if they drink so I don’t want to bring alcohol. Fruit? Cookies?

          "description": "Can someone explain this mentality to me?\n I use a Xiaomi because frankly I keep dropping my phones. My last iPhone was an iPhone 6. I had to replace its screen after 2 months. So I was so OVER IT and swore I'd never spend more than $300 on any phone ever again. \n I do international business. No business people anywhere ever remarked on my phone model. I think they simply do not give a crap. However, Ik lower income folks definitely do judge me for it. \n For instance, Ik a guy who follows me around asking me for a job. Ik his financial situation is quite dire since he's a new graduate who's never had a job that pays more than 10M VND/month. Yet somehow he bought a new iPad that's worth 6 months of rent. He'd keep making hater comments to me, despite begging me for a job btw. He once implied I faked a business trip by posting Google photos (I took the photos myself).\n Another relative of mine kept complaining about her low paying job. Yet when I bought my Xiaomi, she made this snide comment to the effect of \"Oh yea you don't need to buy good phone.\" She exclusively uses iPhone.\n I have 2 iPads that were given to me by my in laws that I never use because I frankly think they're useless. I can't write, can't draw, can't play games, can't read, can't do anything except watch Youtube. My inlaws are also not rich. Yet they like to collect these Apple items which they never use. These items are practically just worthless junks that clutter the house. I simply do not get it. I'd prefer to have my money in things that appreciate in value.\n What's the secret formula of Apple marketing that taps into these people's psyche? \n    submitted by    /u/capheinesuga  \n [link]   [comments]",

This year for Lunar New Year, we've once again been invited to mass and their celebration afterwards. Last year, I made tamales since I'm mexican to share, and although they were well received, I did notice that a lot of people were hesitant to try them. I'm thinking of going a more of an asian route this time, would spicy soy sauce marinated eggs with onions, sesame seeds, chives, garlic etc. be an appropriate dish to bring to compliment other rice dishes or should I try my hand at something else? I feel confident in this side dish in that I make it very often. I know I will be welcomed regardless if I don't bring anything, but I would feel more comfortable bringing something that is familiar that would be eaten vs trying to make another mexican dish that may not be eaten. The community is more on the elderly side, with younger couples in their 40s if that helps.\n Any suggestions are appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/LifeLibertyPancakes  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a white woman (25) who fell in love with Vietnamese culture and people, music, and language and decided to learn the language by myself. I understand and speak 70% of it (my bf tells me). I've never been to Vietnam lol. And my bf has lived here in Europe for 4 years. As weird as it sounds I live with him in a shared house because they came here to work and we live with 5 other Vietnamese males 30+ years old. In a house in a village.\n However, I'm so confused of cultural norms and I don't have anyone to ask lol.\n  \nMy bf always wants me to hang out with his friends even if we go to visit the other Vietnamese workers from nearby cities. He will tell me \"Ngay mai chung ta di choi\" and I'm often the only female among…",

          "description": "TLDR: GF received harassing texts in zalo from a person who said they live nearby and knows where her room is. Find Nearby is enabled so we can't dismiss it as just a random text. Where to report? What should we do?\n Hey all, long post ahead, hoping to find help. My GF (23F), recently moved in to a new dorm and received a zalo text (first 2 messages) out of nowhere.\n I suggested to accept the so we can get the zalo number because I was suspecting it could be related to another incident (of a harassing grab driver, but that is another story). I wanted to check if it could be the same guy, but I didn't realize that would mean she the person will be notified.\n At this point my gf has started panicking and reached out to her landlord to ask if they gave her number to anyone, and also to seek for assistance. But they only told her to lock her doors and not to open if she hears a knock on her door. And that if she gets harassed, to call them so they can help. We asked if there's a way to report this, they said no and this makes me feel really worried.\n She blocked the number and disengaged. I read that it's advisable to send a warning message to the harasser before blocking, but I'm worried this could even trigger them to act on their ill intent. The landlord's advice doesn't help either, she would still need to go out and walk around the area, and the person supposedly lives near. We can't just sit still until something happens. Unfortunately my gf only found out after that there is a find nearby in zalo so we cannot be sure if this is a random harassing text, but the fact they refer to it as 'room' makes me think they could indeed be living nearby.\n I live overseas, and im really worried about her safety. My GF is also an international and is not familiar on how to navigate things like this in Vietnam.\n Would going to the police help or do they dismiss reports like this?\n Any help would be appreciated, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/buzzzzkill_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Basically every day we go for a walk some Vietnamese person starts to yell at us, saying our dog is shitting on the street by their house, or whatever. Funny thing is that we are the only people in the area that actually walk our dog on a leash, and we carry bags to pick up our dog's shit, you know, like educated members of any normal society. We even explain this to people, but their too fucking stupid to care.\n It's not even the same person, it's like everyday some idiot feels the urge to yell at us or start jumping and rushing our dog to scare it. Side note: our young dog was abused by Vietnamese people (and small children) and left alone and sick in the street as a puppy and does not like being approached like that. \n Our dog wasn't doing anything tonight and some woman started berating us and saying she'd call the police because she assumed we were making our dog shit on the side walk. She was full blown psychotic and her fucking 6-7 year old kid was just standing there watching his mother act like a wild animal. For a society that hates being called dogs, a lot of people in my area don't deserve to be called a dog, as that would be giving them a compliment. End rant, sorry this shits, pun intended, been pissing me off for so long.\n    submitted by    /u/yesimforeign  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear people of color \n My post is based on multiple trips to multiple cities in Vietnam \n I have to warn you that if you are solo traveling through Vietnam and you have a dark skin,in my experience when you come to Saigon and Hoi An expect to be ostracised by many of the service staff in the tourist friendly restuarants and shops in these places .\n In these two cities you will be treated with disdain by large proportions of tourist service staff who are very clear in their distaste at serving you . The complete difference in the way dark skinned people are ostracised and white skinned tourists were fawned over in the same place by the same staff is the most consistently racist experience I have had in my travels to 30 different countries . \n In other accounts on Reddit people have spoken of how they spent their entire holidays in their hotel room to avoid such unpleasant ostracisation \n However in Hanoi and Danang and Dalat I have received much more kindness from ordinary Vietnamese so I suspect this overt dark skin ostracism is a phenomenon localized to certain parts of Vietnam . \n Of course looking at the tons of posts on this topic ,I assume people will offer tons of reasons for discrimination.and they would suggest you suck it up . You don't have to listen to those kind white skinned people on this forum who assure you the Vietnamese can't be racist bcos they fawn over white skinned people like gods .\n If you are a POC i don't think you need to waste your hard earned cash to be ostracised \n I suggest if you do come to Vietnam in my experience I found in Danang or Hanoi or Dalat the people don't appear so ready to ostracise customers with dark skin\n Or if you prefer less ostracism with your coffee go to Thailand or Laos where they don't openly ostracise innocent strangers for the color of their skin \n  \n [link]   [comments]",

After finishing viewing a juggling/circus performance outside a building in the Chinese village, the guide said that people were invited inside for an additional show, requiring a separate ticket, called “the beauties” and that this show was only able to be viewed by people over the age of 18.\n We have two very small children so didn’t go, but my partner and I spent a lot of time wondering what would make a show at a theme park like this adults only? Some ideas we had\n  \nit may involve offering guests shots of alcohol. But we’ve been to shows like this before with kids- they just don’t give the kids alcohol\n \nmaybe it involves playing games with the “beauties” which may be leaning towards gambling\n \nthere may be some jokes or references which aren’t suitable for children. But I would expect references would have to be pretty mature to only be suitable for 18 year olds instead of say 16 year olds. \n \nsomeone is getting naked. Which would be odd for a theme park, but a 18+ show in a theme park is already pretty weird. \n \n So, anyone has any clue of what was making this an adult only production? \n Tl:dr- an otherwise family friendly theme park in Hoi Anh has an adult only show- curious as to what makes it 18+\n    submitted by    /u/WatchAndFern  \n [link]   [comments]",

People could buy houses there, but no land, as this was a whole residential project. Since a few days nobody is allowed to go into the area anymore. Also the homeowners. There's police and people are protesting and even fighting, as I heard. I've heard two versions went this is happening. 1 there's a new project, so people need to go 2 the owner of the land wants something.\n I'm sure that this is not 100 percent accurate, as I don't live in grand world, so it's just what people are talking, but pretty serious.\n Seems like It's not a good idea to buy single apartments or houses without land.\n    submitted by    /u/Realistic-Elk-7423  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I did mentioned that prior to the booking but he kept on reassuring me that it is fine) but my gut instinct said I should cancel so I did. He won’t let me cancel, tried to call me multiple times but I insisted and he confirmed it. (I did try to rebook with another cruise that I like but his price were 1m higher than what he told us)\n The morning after (today) I found a lot of bad review on Google which confirmed my suspicions. And then I got the call from the driver to come and pick us up which I find kinda weird since I already canceled it, he then call me multiple times, then told someone else to call me and beg me to go on the cruise.\n He then continued to threaten me saying that he will send someone to collect the rest of the money, and said that I should never come back to Vietnam. \n Question: What should I do? I did tried to contact the embassy. They told me to contact the local police but will they really help?

We were talking every week and almost everyday. She is an active viet girl who do a lot of sports but recently, she stopped doing ice skating because her health kinda declined in few weeks at the beginning of 2024. She showed me that her Apple Watch detected 2 times AFib. I told her to see a doctor but she didn’t because she was waiting for her new ID card. \n In the night Saturday night of this weekend. Her father was apparently drunk and her parents was arguing kinda violently as she told me. She said that she was kinda scared. I had to go on Paris at the same time, I told her to try to calm down and all. And I moved out of my house. The next day I sent a message to see if everything was alright but she didn’t responded or saw my message. I sent few messages to her on Discord or iMessage to ask if she was safe, but no response. I have her Apple health informations in real time on my iPhone, yesterday she walked only 90 meters and only 550 meters on Sunday. She apparently doesn’t wear her Apple Watch since 3 days :/ So I can’t see her heart informations. \n I’m worried that anything happened to her. Btw she’s an online student, so if she was studying, I would see her at least online on discord. \n What can I do ?

You cannot drive any vehicle, and your stomach gets twisted and turns upside down. It's really bad for your health. Most of the stuff people drink is low quality, and the container for the drink is literally a gasoline can.\n With close family, I can get away with drinking less, but in the workplace, there is a lot of pressure to drink. It's considered very disrespectful if you decline a drink offer or if you don't offer a drink to an elder/senior. You will be considered the outcast, the weirdo of society; you have to drink to earn a little respect. I hate that the cons of not drinking outweigh the cons of drinking even it can lead to greater danger to life.\n I understand the experience of sharing good food or singing karaoke, partying with people, but why do you need alcohol? After being drunk, I make no progress at work or for myself; I'm just stuck in bed, wasting my life. Maybe I am a big snowflake, but alcohol, to me, is the devil's drink, and I still don't get it. Sorry if this post is too much ranting from me.\n What is your experience with drinking in Vietnam?\n https://preview.redd.it/8kb1m59v7ifc1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f24ea40a5b3faa0e705d3a8007c60f3a7c94542\n    submitted by    /u/Skytheslash  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hanoi/Halong Itinerary with young kids and elderly\n Hi All, I cannot find the answer anywhere after scouring the internet…\n We have some elderly and some toddlers on this trip to Vietnam coming up. One of the elders speaks Vietnamese so hopefully we can get by OK. But I gotta do all planning. My questions regarding this trip:\n 1) We plan for 3 nights in Hanoi area with a Halong Bay cruise and Ninh Binh (maybe?) tour. I’ve read anything from just booking onsite with hotel to planning ahead online and avoiding scams. What to do with the large family group like this? \n 2) Overnight or day cruise to Halong Bay with kids and 80 yr olds? I imagine we will stay in Hanoi on the first night and head out to Halong the next morning. However, I am reading a lot about these tour operators who extend the drive from Hanoi to about 3 hrs by stopping by some random vendors like pearl shops. Don’t want to do this with kids if we can cut down drive time to about 2 hrs. I also don’t love the idea of staying overnight in a boat but it might be less tiring than a roundtrip drive in one day. \n 3) Do you book your stay in Hanoi and come back to the same hotel after Halong cruise (ie if you’re doing an overnight) or do you lug all your stuff with you?\n 4) Ninh Binh doable with really young kids in this time span? I realize the trip is super short though I hear it’s worth visiting. \n 5) We are headed to Nha Trang after Halong Bay (or Ninh Binh). Ideally Halong Bay > Haiphong airport is a shorter route to get to Nha Trang airport so we don’t have to go all the way back to Hanoi. But it seems only Vietjet operates direct flights at this airport whereas we prefer VN airlines where Hanoi would have flights. Wondering if I should consider the smaller airport close to Halong to avoid the round trip drive back to Hanoi. \n 6) Any other suggestions with little kids such as just hiring a private driver/shuttle vs tour groups. \n Thanks!!!\n    submitted by    /u/boxybiscuit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n Since our time in Vietnam we have found that the locals have been trying to scam us in numerous ways, such as buses not arriving at the actual bus station and dropping us 5km outside of the designated bus stop at 3am where a local taxi driver is waiting. (Charging 500k for a 5km journey) to our hotel, which was beside the actual bus stop we were supposed to be dropped at. \n Our driver made a call on the way to the hotel and when we arrived the hotel was shut. We have literally discussed our early/ late arrival with the hotel but now they had the door and cover shut. (Like it had been abandoned)\n Luckily our taxi driver, who just happened to know where the bus would drop us, and made a call just before dropping us to the hotel, knew of another hotel. He dropped us to this small dingy homestay where he clearly knew the owner and we paid 700k dong for a disgusting room which was not worth 200k dong.\n When we were in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, obviously you had people trying to make a few extra dollars from you, but never so orchestrated as in Vietnam where there seems to be an actual system in place.\n I am just curious, as an Irish person, I would hate to see this happen to Vietnamese tourists coming to our country and would be sure to voice up for it to stop, nor would our local community.\n What are Vietnamese people's thoughts on this ? Does it bother you or do you all enjoy trying to extract as much money as possible from people visiting your country ?\n    submitted by    /u/CONATY93  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m sure many of you studied English in school, but was that sufficient to get you to the level you’re at now? For me, school provided a 'logical' understanding of the language. However, I found it challenging to comprehend native speakers because the English taught in textbooks differs significantly from spoken English, and the accents of public school teachers aren’t always perfect.\n Upon finishing school, I struggled to watch videos or movies in English, even though I could somewhat manage reading textbooks - albeit with some effort. There came a point when my favorite show stopped being subtitled in Vietnamese, forcing me to watch it with English subtitles.\n Initially, it was difficult, and I didn’t understand much. But over time, things started to make sense, before I knew it, my YouTube feed had become entirely English - primarily due to the lack of useful content in Vietnamese. The auto subtitle feature of youtube came out around that time so that was super useful too.\n TL;DR: School gave me a foundation in English, but only after watching and reading a lot of English content does it click for me.\n    submitted by    /u/IHateMacWithAPassion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys 🫡, this is the first time I've used this function in an app (weirdly???), so I think a lot about the topic that I can discuss with guys. Finally, I wonder why dont i share about schoolwork or daily days. So that reason I'm here. Not rambling more, today I will talk about my ambition of schoolwork. I'm a normal student in my public school which I tried my best to enroll in (it is one of the best in my province). Therefore, when I study there, I try a lot to \"catch the life melody\". I'm not the type of smart person, the achievement I got is my diligence every single day. In the first year of the class in this school, I studied a lot to be an excellent student (I'm studying a new curriculum, so 9.0 average for 6 subjects to be an excellent student) but I can not. That time, I was so disappointed in myself, because I struggled with studying very much. Fortunately, I learned that studying too much does not mean getting high marks or good results, I have to study effectively, study smarter, and focus on the main lesson/idea in that subject. And u know what, by my efforts and belief in myself, finally the second-year class I got it * That was so amazing!!(^)* I was cheerful when I got praise perk. At that moment, I was so satisfied with my performance academic. Currently, I don't know why but I wanna get higher achievements than now, no longer satisfied with myself. Moreover, I wanna join some activities in school such as dancing, clubs, and more interesting things. As a result, sometimes I burn out, exhausted but I receive new experiences, and worthwhile memories with my friends. 🤔Do you think that when we are young or students we should try our best to achieve the best result? And the ambition like me, is it right?\n Btw, my English is not good, so I hope everyone can sympathize with me😇. Thanks a lot😘\n    submitted by    /u/InternationalGoat147  \n [link]   [comments]",

After the accident a traffic policeman/detective went to the hospital I was in to ask some questions to my Vietnamese coworkers visiting me.\n One of my coworkers told me he wanted to check my messaging history on my phone (I have no idea why). They refused to let him access that.\n After being discharged at the hospital, I went to the police station to meet the other driver I crashed with and fully compensated him for the damages of his car (he didn't suffer any injuries) and we both signed a document to cease any legal case caused by the accident.\n Yesterday I went again to the transit police station to pay for the fines related to the accident while I was driving my motorbike. The policeman gave me a document so I was able to collect back my motorbike after I paid everything. After leaving the police station he texted me on Zalo to ask about the identity card and one more document of one of my coworkers (specifically, the one who refused to show him my chats). Again, I have no idea why he needs that.\n At this point I want to cease any contact with the police since I already compensated the other driver and paid the fines related to the accident.\n Do I have any legal obligation to reply to the policeman who keeps texting me on Zalo? Should I stop replying to his messages and get a lawyer in case they require more documents in the future?\n I'm starting to feel paranoid about the whole situation.\n Any help is appreciated. Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/QuestioningStoic  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My wife and I are putting the finishing touches on our North Vietnam itinerary in late March and we're deciding where to spend an extra day: Pu Luong or Cat Ba. We're definitely doing Pu Luong for 1 night and Ha Long Bay for 1 night but not sure where to add the extra night between Pu Luong and Cat Ba. We're also going to Hanoi and Ninh Binh for multiple nights but this the part of the trip where we're undecided still so any advice much would be much appreciated.\n Here are my thoughts: \n  \nIf we do 1 day in Ha Long Bay, we'll only do a 1 day cruise and skip Cat Ba. If we do 2 days, we'll do 1 day cruise and 1 day Cat Ba and rent a scooter to explore the island. Hearing mixed reviews on this part of the trip so wondering if 1 day cruise is enough. \n I know this won't be peak time of year for rice fields in Pu Luong but it looks like a beautiful, less touristy area which is appealing since I expect the other locations to be crowded. 1 day will be pretty rushed but also not sure how much there is to see. \n  \nI have no idea what to expect in either place outside of some Google images and reddit posts but if anyone has been to both places – especially in this time of year – it would be awesome to get your thoughts. \n    submitted by    /u/thebeesknees210  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently had a fall and hurt my foot, which got worse over a few days. I went to hospital today under the advice of my hotel, and they have been nothing short of amazing. The manager came with me to help with translating, waited 2 hrs in hospital with me before going home to her family. One of the bus boys gave me his arm to lean on accompanying me to the taxi and was ready waiting for me when I returned. A third one followed holding an umbrella over my head. All these kind gestures made my experience that much easier, and I wanted to thank them. I'd love to leave them separate tips, without digging too deep in my budget but without offending them either ... What do you think is a good sum to tip in this situation?

I matched this girl on Tinder on january around tet 2022 (let called her N) and first N is very kind very nice to me offer to even buy me things at first she catch me off guard by buying me some stuff and kept in mind at this point we havent even met yet,then she starting to stalk my fb account then she’ll said she my friends cousin and i later on confirm that yes she is indeed my friend’s cousin and thay raised trust level in me after a few days she asked me for a gift and valentine is just around the corner so why not ? N asked me to send her 100$ for her gift because i already somewhat trusted N so i send her the money after a while i asked to meet her but she kept asking for more money and being a stupid 19 years old,I send her total 800-900$ ish im not sure around 18mil,then around 3 months talking i found out she was also talking to this singapore guy for nearly 2-3 years and he told me he had plan to come to vietnam to meet her and he also was sending her money which is crazy and idk how much men she had tricked (if you guys are in similar situation or needed more info d/m me)i had kept this secret for so long because it was so stupid and tbh really embarrassing to even tell anyone. p/s:my “friends” that was her cousin told me later on after i told him about her he said they werent that close and she is on his mom family side so before any of you guys said she is catfish ect and tbh with you guys she might be tho,cause she give me her friends bank account everytime i transferred her the money,this is the most dumbest thing i have ever done and idk what’s wrong with me at that moment.I just want to get this off my chest\n    submitted by    /u/ItsDefinitelyNotKris  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently have two full days and nights in Ho Chi Minh City and was trying to sneak a day to fly over to Hanoi and check it out, really just to say I saw it, but I would say Ho Chi Minh City appeals to me more. Is it worth taking the flight over to see the city or should I just book an extra day in Ho Chi Minh City to see it more completely?\n I might not be back in the area for five to ten years.\n I realize a lot of people will want to reply with something like \"It all depends on you\" and \"We can't know what you enjoy\" type comments, but please refrain from those. It's obvious that everyone is different and the right decision for one is not the right decision for another. I guess I'm really just asking if a third day in Ho Chi Minh will be more productive and fun than trying to squeeze whatever I can out of Hanoi in 15 waking hours or so.\n    submitted by    /u/IAmBillN  \n [link]   [comments]",

My entire family each has a way to verbally and mentally abuse me but my granddad is by far the worst. He would say things like “you’ll wait till I’m dead then you’d come visit? You ungrateful, disgraceful, uneducated child”, or “why don’t you f**k off and never come back” etc. These episode would last for at least 2-4 hours and he won’t let me leave the room or if it’s a phone call, he’ll cuss me out and hang up without saying anything else. \n My mom would force me to endure these episodes because “you owe them your life. Who do you think give us money to raise you”. And my dad is just passive aggressive saying things like “it’s fine con, no need to come back and visit us”. And my sister on the other hand is so worried about the inheritance that she’s yelling at me how the West (I’m from the US) has ruined me and my values are killing our chances for a good share of inheritance… I’m just so lost and hurt and I truly don’t want to go back at all.

Bài học: trên đời chỉ có cứt chim với nước mưa là miễn phí.\n Tuổi trẻ tài lanh, tui mong kiếm được tiền nhiều. Đọc để anh em rút kinh nghiệm nhé. Tui ghi như một trang nhật ký hành trình thôi. Ghi rồi quên, nhưng lâu lâu sẽ lục lại để nhìn về quá khứ.\n Ừm thì, tui tốt nghiệp BK, đi làm kỹ thuật được 1 năm. Cộng với tiền học bổng, tui đi làm thì để dành được 130tr. Tui không đi chơi, ăn uống thì ở nhà. Với tui, đó là một số tiền tiết kiệm kha khá để khởi nghiệp :)\n Nhưng mà khổ một nỗi, sự việc ấy đã đến vào 25/04/2023. Chuyện xảy ra 2 tuần sau khi chia tay bồ. Lúc đó, tui khá trầm cảm. Do lần đầu có người yêu, nên chia tay với tui là cú sốc tâm lý. Bây giờ nghĩ lại, không biết tui quăng tiền vào là vì chia tay rồi nghĩ quẩn, hay thực sự là tui quá non. Dù sao đi nữa, tui cũng ngu như bò.\n Mọi chuyện bắt đầu từ một cuốc điện thoại, rồi qua Zalo, rồi qua Telegram. Trên Telegram, tui nhắn tin với tài khoản NVHD_DUYTUNG. Hắn tự gọi mình là người hướng dẫn và chỉ cách kiếm tiền.\n Bước đầu tiên, hắn cho tui vào nhóm và làm nhiệm vụ. Yêu cầu cũng khá đơn giản. Vào trang web tv360, like bộ phim được chỉ định và chụp lại làm bằng chứng. Mỗi nhiệm vụ được 15000₫, và tui làm được 4 lần. Thế là có 60000₫ bỏ túi. Hay vờ lờ.\n Nhưng mà nhiệm vụ thứ 5 thì khác. Lần này là nhiệm vụ ăn tiền. Chúng nó cho tôi vào một nhóm nhỏ gồm 3 người (tay trong hết). Sau đó, tôi được tạo tài khoản trên trang web chúng nó và bắt đầu chơi tài xỉu. Thề với anh em, trước khi lên đồn trình báo, tôi còn méo biết tôi đang thuộc diện đánh bạc :)\n Nên thôi, anh em rút kinh nghiệm xương máu từ thằng ngu này nhé.\n    submitted by    /u/massive_buttocks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was looking at a lot of islands by Ha Long and was interested there. I am looking for somewhere with nice water, beaches, and access to city as well. Also, since we are students we would like to minimize the cost as much as possible. So if anyone has any suggestions for cheapest ways to travel to and in vietnam that would be great. Also, how does the currency exchange work? Roughly how much will it cost to eat and do activities in vietnam for 5 days? If anybody can answer even some of my questions and give recommendations that would be amazing.\n ​\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Asier559  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am overweight and in my research about the country I learnt in advance that the topic of weight comes up very often and that the cultural approach to the topic is very different than for example in europe where I come from. Now it has actually happened to me many times here that I have been asked about my weight or have been pressurised by strange men to get on a scale etc., but as I have already anticipated this, I try not to be too hurt and just let it pass me by. However, I haven't had a single really friendly encounter in Vietnam so far and I'm really starting to wonder whether it's because of my weight that I'm being treated more disrespectfully? I'm a very polite person and try to smile a lot and always say please, thank you, hello and goodbye but I never get a reply and hardly anyone speaks to me for more than two words (unless it's about my weight). \n As I am travelling alone, the experience of being here feels very lonely and sad and I wonder if I can change anything personally or if it really is my appearance?\n Edit: as I think it's important. I am really overweight like 40kg too much. Not like 10kg and just a bit more chubby.\n    submitted by    /u/EnvironmentalSlip861  \n [link]   [comments]",

She is very westernised in the sense of liberal thought, accent etc, however her parents are very traditional. I am from a non-Vietnamese background. \n She had recently divorced her husband who is Vietnamese. They had an 8 year old son. I also have a son of the same age. Early in the relationship, her ex-husband would come around to her apartment when I was there for the custody change over. She asked me to ‘hide’ in her room so that he would not see me. She claimed that he was still talking to her mother and would tell her she has a boyfriend. \n I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but this continued for months. I never met her parents. She told me this was ‘cultural’ and her mother would come around eventually. \n I made to the mistake of meeting up with her on an overseas trip to the US which she had taken with her sister, to meet up with their cousins. I was told that I had to meet her in a neutral location, as I could not see the cousins because her mother had told them that she was still married. During this trip she broke up with me. We got back together a few times, but this issue continued and caused a lot of issues. Eventually, she broke up with me by text message after 3 years of emotional investment and me hoping things would change.

They’ll pour you free tea of any kind, and tell you about Vietnamese culture and tea.\n Chà Trà Tea Room - 5 Ngõ 73 Giang Văn Minh, Đội Cấn, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam\n Long story - We wandered in this alley and discovered this tea house. They immediately welcomed us. It was the brother of the owner and a local guest, drinking tea. The place looks like a museum, displaying about a hundred of handmade teapots, which are the owner’s collection. \n They offered us to take a seat, and started brewing tea for us, and it was delicious. Then they offered me to seat in the brewer’s place, with all the equipment and asked me to try brew some tea, teaching me the ceremony procedure. Then the owner’s son approached, and he could speak English so he started translating and telling us about the history of the store, the teas, etc, asking us about our travelling, our country. It felt so warm, welcoming, it was the highest level of hospitality. Then they brought also boiled corn, while changing teas and brewing more and more. They didn’t ask or accept a penny, and said that drinking tea there is free for anyone. Afterwards the Owner (the dad), his wife, and his friend ( some national tea expert) came. They started making even more tea, that tasted too good to be true. The dad started telling us about the tea culture in Vietnam, about their hospitality, healing properties of the teas, the soul component, it was genuinely wonderful and exciting. Almost 3 hours flew by in a blink. We got to buy a pu-erh cake that is made with tea between 200-500 years old. \n The interior is really cozy, and the atmosphere is so tranquil and peaceful. We loved it, and i think that it should be much much much more popular. Their family is wonderful and made us feel like home!\n    submitted by    /u/whlatislovee  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ran into someone this morning while riding my motorbike, and they claimed I hit their motorbike and demanded 100,000 to get it fixed. They forced me to brake as they rode ahead of me. Although I was a little apprehensive, I offered them 200,000 to solve the situation and asked for change because I didn't want to get into any difficulty(lmao I'm that naive). I also believed that I had struck their motorbike. But after taking a peek at my wallet and realizing I had a lot of cash, they demanded more. Now that I knew they were trying to scam me, I seized the opportunity to \"steal\" my 200,000 and fled as quickly as possible. \n They looked so gangster-like that I believed I had somehow lost my sense of reason.

They would claim the government required this to report us to the local establishment. We had one bad incident where the hotel has bugs and we requested to leave immediately, but they would not give us our passports until we paid them (even though we didn't stay more than an hour). \n Is this still a standard practice? To clarify, we did stay at local establishments, not corporate companies, like Hilton. First, we had concerns if we would even get our passports back, and our other concern was if something should happen while we were exploring that we would need it.

          "description": "Hello, I will be 23 soon this year. I am trying to decide if I should try for Peace Corp in VN (that is if I get accepted/I pass the medical exams), or try for TEFL.I am trying to see if I should try applying for Peace Corp in VN or just do TEFL in Vietnam. I am currently doing an English teaching volunteer experience as of now (soon I might get a temporary teacher's assistant position), graduated already with a bachelors and have a TEFL cert. My Vietnamese is at A2 (heritage speaker) and I am working to improve it.\n My goals is to see more of the culture in everyday life and learn more of the language. I am unsure of the pros and cons to either option. That being said I would like to do Peace Corp at some point in my life. Either way I would need to save up it turns out when the VN cohort leaves is approximately around the same time I plan to leave.I see that by the time of this year, I will probably be at a low B1.\n My main concerns are really if I would be able to learn the language to around B2/C1 by the end of the two years (plans are to continue taking classes and studying, as well as using the language as much as I can). I did post in the TEFL and peace corp subreddits but I wanted to get some perspectives. I was recommended by a user on r/expats to post here too.\n Originally my plan is if I get accepted to Peace Corp in VN (assuming I get accepted and pass the medical/legal exams) and I go, I would do it for the entire duration and then evaluate. If not, I would do TEFL for two years and then evaluate. Right now I graduated but I haven't found anything in my field and I figured I might as well get my Vietnamese to advanced since that is what I wanted to do since I was a kid. I could go back to the States and do a different career afterwards, sure I would be setback but I don't have much to lose.\n I would also like to see if anyone has experience doing either TEFL or Peace Corp or something similar to what I am wanting to do.\n    submitted by    /u/throwaway_071478  \n [link]   [comments]",

He has an estranged son (none of us know him or are in contact with him) and while my other uncles and mom was handling the death certificate, the US consulate was able to get a hold of his son. Unfortunately his son considered some options verbally but stopped responding, so there’s nothing in writing. There is no will. My uncle also has no assets.\n We have the means (and want to) bury him as we have a family cemetery in VN. It seems like my parents and other uncles couldn’t get permission to move forward with the burial. How does next of kin responsibilities work? Can’t they just keep going down the line of kin if the first one doesn’t take action? I’m just sad that his body is stuck at the hospital indefinitely and none of us can get closure.\n I also don’t want my family to get in trouble if they attempt to get the body from the hospital.

We have often been told that it's not possible for those who haven't traveled to any other countries to apply for a Schengen visa. While we can afford to travel for one week in Europe, we do not have enough funds to visit other nearby countries beforehand. I believe that as long as we have proper documentation, can prove that we have enough budget to finance our trip, and have a well-prepared travel plan - in this case, it's on the tour agency's side - we will be able to obtain a travel visa. But, is that not enough?\n Thank you in advance.\n edit: What if I only have one year left till my passport expires?

It's the hospital, so most of the people there tend to be older, like 50 and above\n And they always cut the line no matter what they do. I was waiting for my turn for an X-ray, and I could see grandpas trying to cut the line, storming into the doctor's office trying to get the service they want despite seeing lines of other people waiting, just for them to be politely asked to get out and get in line.\n At the cashier, it was even worse, everyone was like all trampling all over each other, trying to squeeze against each other in order to be the one that got the service first. It frustrated me so much because I was like, what was the hurry? Just wait in a goddamn line. Waiting in line wouldn't even work because someone would always try to cut it, and they wouldn't even care that they hit many people in the course of doing so.\n And don't even make me start with the bus. They always must be the one who gets in first and got the best seat even if it causes some jamming. \n I see this type of behaviour much more often in our older generation, like 50 and above, than our younger counterpart.\n Do you guys notice the same thing too, or is it just the people where I live?\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Arugula6148  \n [link]   [comments]",

They immigrated to America when they were in their early 20s, so I was born and raised there. My mom's talking to our cab driver about how much Vietnam has changed then as well as the cultural and value differences between the two countries. Specifically their conversation about family values had me in tears. I knew that Vietnamese culture has a very heavy emphasis on family. Most times, you got whole generations living in the same house. Everybody is constantly supporting and looking after one another like parents will provide for their kids regardless of their age. Similarly, even after the children are all grown up, they stay behind to take care of their family. However, American family values is not like that. Sure children love their parents, but they're quick to move on and live their life as soon as they're able to support themselves. Which I would say is true. Lot of kids try to move out as soon as they hit 18 which is considered a transition to adulthood. I think a good amount of them will use college as their escape from home. My brothers and I all have goals to move out, start our own careers/lives as soon as we're able to, and she's expecting to probably go to a nursing home when she's unable to take care of herself. I just honestly feel so guilty and sad that she feels like that. Of course I want to be able to take care of my parents. I don't want to stick them in the nursing home but at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in the same place until it's my parents' time. I haven't thought about anything like that til now, and I'm not really sure what I would even do. \n    submitted by    /u/Character-Cut1014  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One thing I have noticed is that at many Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in New Zealand, the customers at any given time seem to be mostly Vietnamese or other Southeast Asians(Laotian, Cambodian) or East Asians(Korean, Japanese, Chinese) with not many non-Southeast Asians/East Asians. On the other hand, I notice much more diverse clientele at, Italian, Japanese, Thai, and (westernized) Chinese restaurants. When I lived in Australia, however, there were a lot more non-Asians eating in Vietnamese restaurants.\n For Australia, I know that Vietnamese have a longer history there than in New Zealand, and people are thus much more familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, but I still found it interesting how Vietnamese food seemed to be proportionately more popular among non-Asians in Australia than among non-Asians in New Zealand, despite the fact that Australia and New Zealand are neighboring countries.\n So, out of curiosity, at Vietnamese restaurants in Vietnam and other countries, how popular are they among non-Asians? Do you come across Vietnamese restaurants with diverse clienteles?\n    submitted by    /u/Muangthong200  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are a group of 4 planning on visiting Vietnam for a month in April starting in Saigon and moving our way North (eventually having to come back to Saigon to fly back home). I was thinking to rent a car for the four of us to be able to travel from city to city to avoid taking the train/bus as I wanted us to be able to travel on our own time and not be at the whim of bus/train schedules as well as be able to make pit stops and enjoy the scenery along the way. Ideally would love to be able to rent in Saigon and drop off the car in Hanoi and fly back to Saigon to catch the plane back home. Aside from driving inside Saigon (as I know traffic looks a little hectic) is driving a car around Vietnam recommended, safe, convenient, practical?\n    submitted by    /u/PudgyNugget  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was during a time when I was nervous about returning to Vietnam and meeting my relatives that I have not met a long time ago. So after visiting Vietnam and meeting my family and talking them (in English), I kind of have some newfound respect on Vietnamese language. Despite currently having little economical, political, and entertainment advantage compared to languages like Mandarin, French, Japanese, etc. I somehow wanted to take the commitment to learn Vietnamese. Despite these disadvantages, I wanted to learn Vietnamese because so that I can just have a nice chat with the locals and my relatives. It just as simple as that. So yeah.

          "description": "My wife was born in Vietnam to Vietnamese citizens and left in 1991 for Canada and naturalized as a Canadian citizen a few years later. She never renounced Vietnamese citizenship, but never renewed her passport, and Canada has always allowed dual citizenship. Question: Did she retain Vietnamese citizenship to this day?\n I am reading about the laws and it is very confusing given multiple changes in the past decade. In 2009 Vietnam recognized dual citizenship and said those who had left Vietnam prior must renew their passport to retain citizenship. This was extended to 2014 as very few did it. Again, it seems this was extended or cancelled, I don’t know about this part. Anyone in a similar circumstance successfully renewed their passports from abroad after decades?

How much cash (american USD and vietnamese VND) should we keep on us? My mom kept saying crisp 100 dollar bills but wtf?

I stayed with her in her apartment for five days and she basically treated me like I was her boyfriend. She spent a lot of time with me, showed me around, gave me her motorcycle and instructions to explore while she had to do some work. She took me out, cooked for me and even did my laundry. We slept together. And we got to talk and get to know each other a little bit.\n I've never experienced anything like it. She is a very attractive, smart young woman. \n After leaving and coming back to Saigon I felt I wanted to spend more time with her before going back to Europe in a couple of weeks, so I told her that I'd like to see her again. She said I was invited again and that I can stay until I need to go back to Europe (two weeks). I slept on it and decided that I actually want to spend some more time in the city before going back and that spending that much time with her might be too much for me. We then spoke on the phone and I told her that I'd like to come again for 5 days and she got upset and offended that I didn't want to spend all of my time with her and told me it's better we don't see each other then.\n And that was it. I actually wanted to spend more time with her and see where things could possibly go, but it would have been very difficult because she lives and works in a more rural area. I'm not sure what her intentions were exactly, but I appreciated the experience.\n    submitted by    /u/usdavor  \n [link]   [comments]",
