You look Chinese … etc. While in Vietnam, if we see a white person and we want to know where they’re from, we respectfully ask: Where are you from? We did not just straight up calling them French, Canadian or some nationality. We just referred to them as ”Tây” = Westerner; or “Người nước ngoài” = People from outer countries. If you’re back people will say you black. If you’re white people say you’re white. But when your EA or SEA or random Asian they say ‘Chinese’??? \n Asia is so diverse, there are Laos, Mongolia, Malaysia, etc. :) Especially Vietnam has a painful history fighting back from China and suffers from cultures destruction and assimilation by Chinese, the feeling is worse. \n I wish one day everyone can be more acknowledged of racial diversity in Asia and ask them more general question like : “Which part of Asian are you from? What’s your ethnicity?” Instead of labeling people with something that we are not sure of.\n racism\n    submitted by    /u/Louis_vo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel like it’s fair to share the news when the time is right, so she can maybe live life a bit differently. \n Maybe I’m just Vietnamese-American and I just don’t understand the culture. Can someone give me more perspective and understanding to this difficult situation?\n    submitted by    /u/StrikingManner  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone! Today I would like to discuss some tech and apps that can improve our daily routines. There are many apps and services that already make life easier in other countries. Some countries have completely automated and digitized everyday life. For example, there are apps that help with logistics such as scheduling appointments or managing deliveries; grocery delivery apps; payment apps that make transactions quicker and more secure. Doctor's appointments, accounting services, freelance work - the list goes on. And it is not necessarily something complicated and expensive, some services are convenient and popular, although behind them is a small development team.\n So, please share the apps and services that you're excited to try. Share your experiences and opinions, and feel free to elaborate on any particular features or benefits that you found most useful.

While I am drawn to the cooler climate and natural beauty of Ha Giang, I worry about the potential challenges of living in a smaller city with fewer amenities and opportunities.\n If anyone has made a similar transition from a larger city to a smaller one in Vietnam, I would love to hear about your experience and any advice you may have.

Obviously my kid struggled to ride it well.\n On the return around, I asked why is the tire deflated? Can you inflate the tire so we can have a better test?\n Their smart answer was, \"It comes from the factory like that. If you want us to inflate it, you'll have to buy it first.\"\n Completely ridiculous. Mind you we are still evaluating and testing the product, and you want us to make a buying decision while the product is unusable? After that conversation, I noticed the handle bar was completely loose. Figures as much why my son struggle to turn the bike. I put the bike back to find another bike. The 2nd bike I found also had a handle bar that was also completely loose from the front wheel. Someone assembling the product in their department needs to be evaluated.\n Why on earth do you setup a display of bikes that are unprepared for test ride for children? Why is your smart response are that the bikes \"come from the factory like that\" an appropriate answer for deflated tires? And why do you expect people to buy it from you while they can't even get normal working conditions to evaluate the quality of a product?\n I didnt expect this type of low end service behavior from buying at a department store, at a big mall no less.\n    submitted by    /u/vubitcry  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This question is not just for vietjetair, it helps me if you have the same issue with any other form in Viet Nam. :)\n I am a foreigner in Vietnam, when I buy a flight on Vietnam Airlines I have no problems because the website is well developed, but when I buy it on vietjetair, the website does not allow more than 25 characters in the given name and last name fields. I have a very long European given and last name and it doesn't fit on the form.\n I always have to shorten it and that causes me a lot of problems at the airport because while passing control they stop me saying the name in the ticket is no the same name shown in the passport, I always waste time explaining to the staff that my name doesn't fit on the form when I buy the ticket through the Web. Many times I have to wait until manager comes and tell me is ok after check my passport and explain again the issue and once I almost miss flight because they made me wait too long.\n I have contacted the company and they do not give me any solution. Anyone with the same problem?\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/OrnaPlayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, instead of outrage, some netizens have applauded the officer's actions, with comments such as \"Very good beating,\" \"Always support the police,\" and \"I fully support the police officers like this.\"\n This kind of reaction might seem shocking to those of us living in the Western world, where instances of police brutality are often met with widespread outrage and condemn…",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I am visiting HCMC in early June, partially as a vacation but partially to learn more about the local scene for entrepreneurs and freelancers. I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I'm strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.\n As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I'm not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.\n Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats? Anyone here running their own small business or online business in Vietnam and would like to meet for a coffee or beer?\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/KWNBeat  \n [link]   [comments]",

I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn't hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.\n He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn't) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn't even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.\n POLICE are zero help because I don't remember the drivers cab number.

          "description": "So I often get these friend requests from attractive looking Vietnamese female profiles on Facebook. Sometimes they are from Vietnam and sometimes they are in the US. They would chat with me and reveal their scam by trying to get me to sell random stuffs for them on some scam sites that give them commissions. I think they themselves believe that those scam sale sites are legit. \n Another scam is they say they trade options to make money on the side and can help me make money, I never let it go further than that so I don’t know exactly how they do it. However, 90% of them would just chat and talk to me for weeks and months. I entertain them and keep talking to them to see what the scam is but it never comes. I talk to them like a normal respectful person but never show them that I am thirsty. Eventually they just stop talking to me. \n The one thing in common I noticed is that they would edit old photo posts from months and years ago. Why do this? Is it their way of establishing that the profile is legit because they have posts from years ago? Is there ever a legit reason for someone to edit photos from a couple years ago? I am just trying to understand what is it they want from me or what kind of scam it is because it is a lot of time and efforts they go through. Thank you guys.\n    submitted by    /u/Fifthiteration  \n [link]   [comments]",

Other than basketball, what other team sports is common? What about individual sports? We’re moving there soon and trying to see what will be available for my boys. They’re currently in baseball, soccer/football, and folkstyle wrestling. Doesn’t look like they’ll have access to wrestling from my limited research. What about baseball?

The last post here re Lasik was a few years ago and I'm wondering if anyone here has had the procedure done more recently than that? Cao Thang Eye Hospital looks good.\n Hoping to get recommendations for hospital and costs as well as actual recovery time and follow up appointments.\n As a solo traveller is the recovery something that you can get through on your own? Is it as simple as having a hotel to stay at for the following night and arranging a lift from the hospital back to the hotel?\n What about follow up appointments, I'm not overly keen on staying in HCMC for too long. How about heading to Danang the following day and checking back in at HCMC on the way back to flying out? Were you able to swim and ride a motorbike after the procedure? I think swimming is not recommended. Just wondering what to do in recovery I guess.\n    submitted by    /u/guttyn2905  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll be visiting the country in about a month and I'm wondering how much it would cost to buy this product in a local store. Unfortunately, I cannot order it from the official DJI site because I'll be moving around a lot.\n Can anyone recommend the best stores to go to for purchasing this drone in Vietnam? Also, I'm a bit concerned about the legality of flying drones in Vietnam. What happens if the police catch you with a drone? Is it illegal to fly drones in certain areas of the country?\n Thank you for your help and advice in advance. I'm really looking forward to my trip to Vietnam and I'd love to capture some amazing footage with my new drone.\n    submitted by    /u/VirginMillionaire  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n My fiancée and I are planning to take a trip out to Nha Ttrang in September/October. My company does not give me much vacation time - only 3 weeks a year - so for this trip, I am only looking to spend about 7-ish days in VietNam, with a few of them specifically in Nha Trang.\n I make a fairly good income at my job - just shy over $100K USD - and I'm not reluctant to spend $130-$180 a night at a nice hotel with my fiancée. Unfortunately we are in the process of waiting for a Visa, so do not see one another that frequently. My fiancée doesn't care too much about fancy accommodations since she grew up fairly frugal, but I don't mind spending the extra $$ because I'm a little spoiled.\n Anyways, what is everyone's favourite luxury hotel in Nha Trang? We we will be taking a flight from HCM. The 40-50min drive from the airport isn't a deal breaker, so the hotel does not necessarily need to be in a convenient in-between location from airport and the night market.\n We've looked up a few spots already; Queen Ann, Ariyana SmartCondotel, and Panorama by HLG.\n The biggest thing I'm looking for is a comfortably-sized shower for additional intimacy.\n    submitted by    /u/saint_louis_bagels  \n [link]   [comments]",

At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. \n We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)\n When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.\n Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better. \n    submitted by    /u/NeatGap1348  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there!\n After searching the subreddit, I've seen several questions about short layovers in HCMC (5-6 hours max). Most of the consensus I've read is that Tan Son Nhat makes that short of a stopover risky, and best to stay in the airport. However, in June I'll be flying in on my way back to Australia and I'll have 10 hours of stopover time from landing to the next departure.\n I already went ahead and got a visa, so that should speed things up. If I factor in 30 min to 1 hour for customs, another 30 minutes or so into the city centre via taxi, and then 30 min to get back to the airport 3 whole hours before my international departure, that still leaves me with potentially 5 hours in HCMC. Worth it in my book! I never thought I'd get to set foot in Vietnam so I'm excited to take the opportunity.\n Where's the best area to wander for 5-ish hours in HCMC? Try some local Vietnamese dishes, get a bit of a sense of what the city is like, any quick interesting sights, etc. I'll be there on a Friday if that makes a difference for any markets or things that will be open.\n Thank you so much!\n    submitted by    /u/Icy_Artichoke_6711  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wish I could understand more of it, to surpass my family's language barrier.\n Please recommend me some Vietnamese songs!! I must say that I am not a fan of the Vietnamese music genre(???). You know! Long, drawn-out words with vibrato, sung along with some sort of stringed instrument (sorry mom!!!). \n I want songs with Vietnamese lyrics, but in another style. Rock & Pop-Rock are my preferred genres. Fast, upbeat! And I don't care what the lyrics say as long as they are in Vietnamese. \n Artists/Projects I like: Kagerou Project, Weezer, Wallows, Sex Bob-Omb \n Please do recommend me something!!!

          "description": "I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. \n We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)\n When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.\n Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better. \n    submitted by    /u/Wild-Consequence-517  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been going out on dates here in HCMC with a girl who, though she has lived in HCMC since university, is originally from the city of Tay Ninh. Her family apparently follows Cao Dai. She herself says she has no religion, though she is quite interested in Buddhist philosophy and often reads Buddhist-flavored self-help books (like Thich Nhat Hanh and Haemin Sunim).\n Anyway, she's incredibly kind, fun-loving, philosophical, selfless, and more. I'm just wondering whether coming from a family that follows Cao Dai is like the Vietnamese equivalent of a Mormon family, a Scientology family, or really just no big deal? Is there anything I should be aware of?\n    submitted by    /u/bacharama  \n [link]   [comments]",

For additional context, He is a city guy and I’m more of a nature and landscape gal. We both like water. So based on that I was curious which itinerary anyone would anyone recommend in mid October taking into account the central region rainy season. We also want to ensure we have the most sun/best warm weather in the islands.\n I’m not sure on the amount of days yet in each place so any recommendations are welcome :) also are there any “must see” places I am missing that would fit into the below with the amount of time we have? Thank you!! \n Itinerary 1 Land in Hanoi-> Sapa-> Halong Bay -> hoian? (Not sure if I should avoid due to rain) Fly to Ho Chi Minh -> Phu Quoc islands then back to Ho Chi Minh to fly home \n Itinerary 2 Land in Hochiminh -> Phu Quoc islands -> back to Ho Chi Minh-> fly to Hanoi -> Sapa -> Halong bay -Hanoi and any day trips from there then fly home from Hanoi\n    submitted by    /u/Livinlina  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have spent time all over the country and have been to Ho Chi Minh, Da Lat, Nha Trang, Da Nang and Hoi An. Every city have had its unique feeling and I have loved it so far.\n Now I'm finally in Ha Long, this was supposed to be the real tropical paradise stop with beaches and swimming. Boating through the unique Islands in the bay and just relax before going to Hanoi for the flight back home. \n I decided to go on a bot trip while in Ha Long and just enjoy the almost mystical atmosphere you get boating through the bay between hundreds of small rocky islands.But this absolutely broke my heart, instead of a mystical and paradise like environment we got nothing but waters absolutely full of trash. \n It didn't matter where you looked, it was just full of mostly styrofoam blocks and other plastic waste, but also some random wood and other garbage also floating around. And I'm not surprised that the waters are so littered, there where hundreds of tourist boats in the bay at any given time. Unfortunately this seem to partly be because of over tourism in the bay, and going through Ha Long city there seem to be alot of relatively new developments but 70% of it looked to be empty or abandoned. \n I am just a tourist that get to see this city for a limited time, can anyone from the area tell me more about how you perceive the city's and they bays development over the past few years. And if you have toured Ha Long just as me and have similar or very contrasting experiences, please share. \n Love from Sweden 🇸🇪\n    submitted by    /u/granatfarfar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am looking for any and all advice as I formulate my plan of travel. \n Budgeting; if I am trying to keep it mid to low cost how much can I expect to pay per day? I found some posts that said 50$ a day would be sufficient if I stay in hostels, hitchhike, and take the bus places. (That was including lodging). Does this hold true?\n Things to do: as I have no idea what Vietnam is like i plan to soak up as much as possible. I’m told any and all caves are worth a visit. Is there anyone out there who has been to Vietnam before and is willing to share or send me their itinerary? I can taylor it to my needs but i would be forever greatful to you kind stranger. \n If I want to travel to a different country after Vietnam has anyone had experience applying for a multi trip visa? (Google can probably answer that one for me but there’s nothing better than first hand knowledge).\n Any and all wisdom is greatly appreciated. I plan to Only bring a 40-50L backpack too. Is this feesable.? Experienced backpackers, any pointers on what I should pack and how many of each item? I tend to over pack so I would probably do 2 weeks worth of clothes if I can fit it in the backpack but if someone is able to get away with less then i‘d happily pack lighter.\n    submitted by    /u/throwing_tea  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently started dating an awesome Vietnamese guy. We get along great. I just had a couple questions on the best way to navigate a few cultural differences.\n  \nWhen we go out to eat, should I order my own food or just let him order and ask for extra plates?\n I have several mental health issues and my child is autistic. I am high functioning, receive mental health services, work full time and have full custody of my kids. I know it’s not appropriate to discuss emotions in many Asian cultures but I feel like it’d be the right thing to do to bring it up eventually. How should I do this? Should I be prepared for him to see me as weak and leave?\n What’s the best way to show him I care? My love language is touch but I wouldn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable in public. Would it be acceptable make a dessert for him? \n What else do I need to know?\n  \nThank you!!!\n    submitted by    /u/Chester_12345678  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Wanted to share this because there is almost zero criticism of this place anywhere I could find on the internet.\n We have spent two days here and have decided to abandoned ship and move on with the rest of the country. The main reason is that there is not much to do, and nowhere worth going to eat. \n It obviously depends on what you like, but if it includes meat, you wont be getting that. Almost all meat here is not what it is advertised as, and will likely destroy your stomach the next day. We spent hours researching restaurants to eat at and compared to the rest of Vietnam, they are really quite pathetic. 4.7-5 star reviews on many restaurant are just an absolute joke. \n Da Lat is a picturesque city with a nice climate this time of year. The hotels are all a bit tired and run down but that is to be expected considering the location. There are some nice bars hidden away for people to discover and you can do some small touristy activities like Crazy House, Coaster, Bike trips but that's about it. \n It is interesting that there are not many honest reviews containing criticism of any places in this country.\n    submitted by    /u/Ripstart01  \n [link]   [comments]",

They said that exempt me from getting my claim. Then I had Safetywing but they are more of a (you pay now and file a claim and we will send you the money later) kind of deal. I'm living in HCMC and am just looking for a good insurance plan I can rely on if I do get injured and I can just go to the hospital (Probably Vinmec) and just get helped on the spot no questions asked.

I'm super excited to explore Hanoi and the rest of Vietnam and have a few questions that you can hopefully help me answer.\n  \nAre there any essentials that are hard to get by in Hanoi? My employer will arrange a moving company, so I have the option of stashing up in Rome before the move. \n \nWhere should I live? I am looking for a neighbourhood with a good connection to the Old Quarter for my daily commute (see Q3). I'm coming alone and would prefer an area with a local vibe that is relatively quiet and clean. My employer pays for my accommodation so fortunately I have a wider choice budget wise. \n \nIs my e-bike enough or should I buy a scooter? I currently own a VanMoof S3 with a top speed of roughly 30 km/h.\n \nI have the opportunity of following two weeks of full-time language classes. Can you recommend any schools? A school slightly outside of Hanoi with room and board is possible too. \n \nHow to get social?

I'm wondering about how some of the Indigenous religious traditions overlap (if at all) as I reconnect with precolonial heritage.\n A lot of the articles I read seem to put more emphasis on Len Dong / spirit mediumship happening in the North but also with a handful of practitioners in diaspora like in California of the US who have been trained or came into the role through heredity (e.g. family has a history of it).\n For Ca Ong/whale worship, a lot of coastal villages including the one part of my family came from still do it, but we're disconnected from the culture due to deaths in the family and immigration away from the country. And it seems each village celebrates their festival differently at different moons (TraVinh where some of my relatives were from for example is supposedly on the 3rd lunar month, others do the 6th), and some blend Buddhist traditions with the mourning of a deceased whale, while others remain rooted in Cham culture, and others potentially adopted the Nguyen Dynasty's official policies to worship Can Ong but kept their own local practices too.\n So I'm wondering what the ceremonies and protocols are like, and if the two religions ever overlap, what the ceremonies entail, and what route might be good to inquire further to connect with first.\n    submitted by    /u/messyredemptions  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I visit Vietnam for holiday periodically, and after hearing my (limited) Vietnamese skills, I’m often asked by locals: “Are you Viet Kieu?”\n It seems like a simple question, but I’ve received different answers from locals, relatives, and the internet. To make it more confusing, the meaning seems to have change from older to younger generations. Can you help?\n Is Viet Kieu: - someone born in Vietnam that now lives overseas - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry who now wishes to live in Vietnam again?\n And more importantly (for me)…does Viet Kieu have a bad connotation for locals?\n Thanks for your help!\n Edit: Added small detail for clarity.

And in return, being a local I have experience about what to avoid while being in the country, as I'm familiar with the law and many other things here, as well as knowing which places are cheap and safe, which are overpriced, and which services are good and which scams to avoid.\n I don't mind traveling by motorbike, for I have one of my own. so feel free to reach out and DM me :) I'm currently living in Ha Long, a tourist coastal city located 150km to the east of Hanoi. If you are visiting or planning to visit my city, we can also meet and befriend and I will show you around if you're interested.\n    submitted by    /u/i5sandy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My family is buying property just outside of HCMC. This property is so that my in-laws can retire back to Vietnam. We need to send just over 100K USD from the USA. Wiring/bank transfer of the money would be our safest bet I am assuming. If this is the case, will I be able to open a bank account in Vietnam with only a family visa? I am not able to get Vietnam citizenship reinstated. However my wife is, and she is currently waiting on the paper work to be finished. The property will be the in-law’s name. So I am not worried about loosing said property. Next question that I have is once money is in hand, in Vietnam, what is normally done/happens to transfer the title? Is it a red flag if a newly built condo does not have the red book,title? I was told that this is because the condo was recently built and at this time all units are not sold or finished yet. Though I do know that people have been living in that building for ả least 5 years. One would think that my in-laws would be able to answer these questions. But they have been living outside of Vietnam for 40 years. And I have no close relative alive in Vietnam to ask. Please excuse any poor wording or grammatical errors. Writing coherently in is still a struggle. \n    submitted by    /u/Koicoiquoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wanted to kindly ask you for any songs, artists, or records you would recommend me to add to the playlist. \n I am grateful for any suggestions - except maybe noisy EDM or cheesy mainstream pop! :p It doesn't matter from which Southeast Asian nation the music is from, I prefer explore songs that are sung in a native language, though, and not in English - if the music even includes voice recordings. \n Regarding music which has been released in recent decades, I do particularly enjoy indie rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and post punk, among many other genres.\n When it comes to traditional/older recordings, I appreciate to explore basically everything! =) \n So, many thanks for any recommendations in advance! ;) Here's a link to the playlist if someone's interested in listening to it, too:\n https://spotify.link/2ebRMo7Byyb\n    submitted by    /u/bluebirdlarry  \n [link]   [comments]",

She says it's probably fine and she can talk to the desk and tell them she's actually my GF to smooth it over but won't research ahead of time for me which is frustrating since she's so confident this will work anywhere (internet tells me otherwise).\n I found some sites listing \"girl friendly\" hotels, but they all look pretty dumpy (what you'd expect for that crowd).\n Does anyone know any decent 4-star or so hotels in District 1 that would allow her? I've started to email some places in the meantime. Budget is around $75-150USD/night which should be plenty.

I have my local vinmart, and another vinmart down the road and a circle k. I have to say, my experience of customer service has been the worst I have ever experienced. At the one store, the same girl (in her late 20's), just looks at me and has this look of contempt, of anger almost, grabs my items, scans them then points to the screen in a really 'I can't be bothered, hurry up' way. She grabs my card scans it, prints the receipt and just hands it to me, not even a smile, a nod, a goodbye, no eye contact. The other day she takes the basket and just throws it on the floor. Then again, tonight, the other store, I go in, the young man didn't say one word to me the entire time. No hello, no thank you, no goodbye (in Vietnamese.. I don't expect English)... And just slammed the receipt on the table and continued chatting. My question is, are these people taught by their companies to observe any form of customer service? Is it because they are shy? (even though they stare at me and even once sighed at me for taking too long to use my phone app to pay even though their card machine wasn't working)? Is it because they have no idea what to say to foreigners? Because I've been to other countries and a simple head nod, or even small gesture to acknowledge the customer and make him or her feel welcome isn't so difficult is it? Now I rather hate going shopping now. It is not an enjoyable situation and I'm wondering if anyone else has the same experience in Hanoi. As a customer spending money in these stores I feel entitled to some form of customer service. I dont expect much, but a simple xin Chào, cam on or even a smile to the foreigners who are living and working hard here (or even tourists spending their money here) isn't so difficult...

          "description": "Met a guy in his late 40’s from Vietnam this weekend and I’m trying to figure out how to spell his name. Over the phone I had no idea I wasn’t speaking to an American and heard Jim and didn’t think anything of it. When we met in person I realized he was of Asian descent and when I heard him say his name I realized it wasn’t Jim. \n The best I could describe his name would be how the English word “You” would sound with an “M” at the end, Youm. He said it’s pretty common for people mistake it for Jim. But I’m having trouble figuring out how his name is actually spelled. \n I’m hoping this is a common enough name that I could easily get an answer here.

Even though both my parents, both my sisters (33F, 21F), and I have visited Hanoi several times, most of my mother's side has never visited North Vietnam yet (north of 17th parallel), despite the fact most of her relatives still live in Vietnam (from what I have heard from my mother, her side is quite wealthy and many of her relatives are business owners). Many of them only went around the Southern third of Vietnam and the furthest North many of them has visited is Nha Trang/Dalat. In fact, for all of my mother's relatives in the US (most came during the mid-late 1990s), none of them went above Nha Trang and half of them only visited Vietnam once or twice afterwards.\n Despite the fact I have only lived in Vietnam for 5 years before moving to Russia to study in 2006 and subsequently moving to the US at 11 in 2012, I have visited Vietnam several times afterwards (my most recent trip was in 2019 by the way), and I have visited the following places:\n Ca Mau, Can Tho, Long Xuyen, Ben Tre, Vung Tau, HCMC, Tay Ninh, Phan Thiet, Dalat, Nha Trang, Buon Ma Thuot, Tuy Hoa, Quy Nhon, Pleiku, Quang Ngai, Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Vinh, Thanh Hoa, Nam Dinh, Hanoi, Hai Duong, Haiphong, Ha Long, Thai Nguyen, Sapa\n ​\n  \nI am curious if it is common for Vietnamese people to have never visited the Northern half (North of 16/17 parallel)\n Plus, how common is it for Vietnamese Americans to never return to Vietnam or only return there once since moving to the US\n  \n   submitted by    /u/MussleGeeYem  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just want a jacket and pants, but if the price is good I could be convinced to get a shirt and/or vest too. I am thinking of choosing a charcoal wool/wool blend material.\n I am in my mid-20s but want it to be a versatile suit, so nothing either super vintage nor super modern; Regular length and medium-width notched lapels for the jacket and a slim-straight cut for the pants would be ideal. I also would like the suit to have some stretch, as I often get uncomfortable with the restrictive/stiff feel of store-bought suits.\n My budget would ideally be 5million VND, but a lot of talk online about this stuff is from pre-covid times, so I don't know if that is a realistic number. Please correct my expectations if they are unrealistic.\n What tailors would be appropriate for what I am looking for, and what prices can I expect? Also: do I need to buy the fabric separately on my own, or will that be included in the tailor bill? Or would it be cheaper to buy on my own? \n Any and all advice is much appreciated!

I’ve realised maybe 1 day is not enough for Tam Coc. Plus it’s a long journey from Tam Coc up to Ha Giang…\n After Tam Coc, the plan was to do the Ha Giang loop, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, however if we stay the extra day in Tam Coc, plus the long journey, I’m not sure we will have 4 days to do the loop. \n We have to be in Hai Phong Bay at 11:30am on Monday 10th for a trip to Cat Ba.\n So here is my question:\n Should we skip Tam Coc all together, get up to Ha Giang and just do the loop for as long as we can? Should we do the 2 days in Tam Coc and just do a smaller loop of Ha Giang? Should I stick to 1 day in Tam Coc and the 4 day loop of Ha Giang?\n It looks like if we decide to go to Tam Coc, we will have to get a night bus up to Ha Giang. And of course then another night bus from Ha Giang down to Hanoi. Lot of night travel - is it too much? Should we ease up and save stuff for another visit?\n Thanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/SintHollow  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is directed at people who have traveled/are from Vietnam. \n So I'm going to Ha Long Bay with my university and as part of one of the classes were doing a project (mini doc) about community perception of UNESCO world heritage sites and was wondering if anyone knew what the laws around filming in that area are. I wasn't able to find much information other than for large film crews and as this is a school project where I and another classmate would be interviewing 2-3 locals I don't believe we fall into that category. The setup would be minimal with a tripod, camera, mic, and potentially a very small light if needed.

Around week 5, we are hoping to take a 5 day trip round the Ha giang loop, and I wanted to discuss the logistics of this here. A few notes:\n  \nneither of us have ridden a motorcycle/moped before, but are confident car drivers. We have access to a 100cc motorbike for practice\n both of our UK drivers licences cover \"AM\" vehicles (motorbikes smaller than 50cc) but to ride up to 175cc, we need an A1 licence\n we plan to rent motorbikes in the islands of Thailand earlier in our trip, and gauge whether we think it is feasible to carry out 5 days of driving.\n We will be doing the Ha Giang Loop in early May\n  \nI guess my biggest question is what are our options?\n Should we try to get an A1 licence before we go? (It only takes a day AFAIK so we should be able to sort it before the trip) if we bother doing this, will we be able to get an IDP that works? I've heard conflicting reports regarding the state of IDPs\n Should we go as we are?

          "description": "We will be visiting Bach Ma National Park in April and information is a little difficult to find. We initially thought we would do the five lakes trail, but since our daughter is only nine and, to be frank, rather short for her age, we don't feel comfortable with the climbing part, as we are not sure she will be able to reach for the ropes. There are, supposedly, two trails to reach five lakes - do you also have to climb when you take the easier one (that is, not the adventure trail)? And has anyone done the peasant trail? I have not been able to find any information on this trail, except that it ends in a water fall and has the best likelyhood to see birds (which would actually be super nice). Does this trail involve any climbing, too?\n    submitted by    /u/Erft  \n [link]   [comments]",

I create cinematic content for businesses to use on their social media platform. I have 6 years of experience in social media content curation. My passion for filmmaking has taken me to many places. I have been traveling and volunteering around India, which has been a fulfilling experience. \n Where I grew up very connected to the sea, I grew up on the island life fixing boats, painting them and a lot of community works as apart of the local lifestyle there, as someone who loves nature and sustainability, I'm excited to travel outside of my country for the first time to put my skills to work for a meaningful cause. I'm passionate about balancing sports like slacklining, skateboarding, and surfing. I've spent a good amount of time sharing and teaching these skills. I'm also a documentary filmmaker and love to capture the beauty of nature and the stories of people who live in harmony with the environment.\n Few volunteering opportunities I did : - Helped a farmer for 3 months on his produce somewhere in the lush hills of western ghats in India. - Volunteered for an eco-festival in India to teach skating and help the festival crew. - Volunteered in the himalayas to help build a home-stay with a sustainable lifestyle. - Helped a few homestays and small businesses to provide quality content for their social media.\n Let's work together to make a positive impact while exploring a new culture!\n    submitted by    /u/Unable_Pumpkin6825  \n [link]   [comments]",

To compensate our daughter a bit for all the walking and looking at things, we had considered visiting the Aquatopia water park. As we know by now, the free shuttle bus has been discontinued, but we found out that the public bus #11 (which also runs from the airport) goes close enough to the cable car station. Only unfortunately it seems that the bus is also no longer running, at least I can't find any information about it on the net (not even on the airport page). Has anyone ridden the bus lately or knows that it no longer exists? If it runs, we would look for a hotel along the bus line, otherwise we go, as actually planned, to Ong Lang and forget the thing with the park simply (I have no desire to pay 60€ for cabs to Cable Station and back, then we rather invest the money in as much ice cream as she can eat...).

We all know and love Pho and Banh Mi, but there's so much more to the Vietnamese breakfast scene that often goes unnoticed. Recently, I've discovered a lesser-known but absolutely mouthwatering dish: Banh Cuon Cao Bang! 😋\n For those who haven't tried it yet, Banh Cuon Cao Bang is a delicate and savory rice noodle roll filled with minced pork, wood ear mushrooms, and shallots. It's usually served with a side of fresh herbs, cucumber, and a tasty dipping sauce. It has quickly become my go-to breakfast choice, and I'm eager to find more dishes like this!\n So, fellow foodies, I'm asking you: What are your favorite Vietnamese breakfasts, particularly the lesser-known ones? Let's uncover some hidden culinary gems together and share our love for Vietnamese cuisine. Please share your favorites and any stories or memories you have associated with them. If you have any secret spots or recipes, feel free to share as well!\n Looking forward to reading your responses and expanding my breakfast horizons! 🍽️\n Cheers and happy eating! 🥢\n    submitted by    /u/DragonXDT  \n [link]   [comments]",

People over at r/coffee tend to be pour-over and aeropress guys so I don't read much about other brewing methods there. That's why I decided to ask here. :)\n Any tips on getting the best brew? I personally haven't tweaked much from what I usually do these past months when I first had a phin: Grind 14g of beans using setting 3 (medium fine) for my 6 click cheapo grinder that I bought over at Shopee, preheat the brewer and the glass, dump the grounds on the brewing chamber and shake to level, drop the press filter and press a bit (this one I'm not sure if necessary), pour hot-off-the-boil water about twice the volume of the coffee into the chamber to bloom the grounds and wait for 30 seconds, pour water to the brim of the chamber, then cover to retain the heat. Drip finishes at around 6 mins.\n I usually make coffee via pour-over and I love the different nuances in the process and how each factor affects the output of the brew, But I love the simplicity of the Phin and how no non-sense it is -it's brute force coffee.\n Also, what should I look for if I want to buy a better Phin filter? And if you are a Timemore C2 user, what is your current grind setting?\n I would love to hear from you guys. :) Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Bibingka_Malagkit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Brunei is ASEAN's minnow. East Timor also a minnow. People will not blame them if they didn't schedule.\n But Vietnam? The nation that reached the final round of FIFA World Cup qualification and yet the national team is left starved with domestic league suspended for a month to serve the U-20 and U-23. For what? Professional countries will not interrupt domestic leagues for youth tournaments, only Vietnam does.\n Who is responsible for this? Who deliberately starved the national team?\n Shameful.\n    submitted by    /u/JoJo-Bizarre-1997  \n [link]   [comments]",

We wanted to get married next year but we will be 33* (Vietnamese age plus 1 year for Tet) which is a no go according to her mum. I think we then said let’s do it this year but that was also bad and realistically my family couldn’t make it to Vietnam this year. However, we didn’t want to wait until 2025. So after some consultation with a pháp sư her mum said this year was ok and we will have ancestor welcoming (me?) into the family this year on the day of our legal marriage abroad and the wedding ceremony in Vietnam next year, but since it’s unlucky we are just having a “party” not a wedding ceremony.

We’ve only been dating a couple months, but I’ve already met his parents, and while they are very kind to me, I haven’t had a full real conversation with them. It’s always in passing that we exchange words. I’m white and don’t know much about Vietnamese culture or customs, so I’m not sure exactly how to approach them for fear of accidentally coming off as rude or ignorant. I love my boyfriend a lot, and I go to his house and see them pretty often. He doesn’t have a very close relationship with his family, and even they don’t talk much outside of them asking if he’s eaten or where he is, so I’m not sure if he’d be able to help me here. It means a lot to me, having them like me, as I see us having a long future together. Does anyone have any tips or things I should know/necessary knowledge like what is or is not respectful? Or gift ideas to thank them for letting me stay at their house? Anything would be great. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/music-luvr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The Chams, if I remember right, with the fall of Champa, were separated into three groups practising different religions. The Central Chams have largely retained their Hindu belief, although this is practised under a form called \"Ba La Mon\". The Southern Chams in the Mekong Delta have largely adhered to Sunni Islam and they are the only ethnic group in Vietnam to be Muslims.\n The third Cham group, however, practise a complex religion called \"Bani\". It was thought to be traced from Persian traders (Persia/Iran was converted to Shia Islam by Shah Ismail I), who spread their Shia Islam to the community during the Vietnamese shogunates (Trinh-Nguyen). However, Bani is unique that it is so synchronised with other religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and even Han and Kinh (Vietnamese) people's folk traditions that it lost most of the original Islamic belief.\n The Bani community is small today but their religious practise has ignited discussions. Some groups believed that they are actually Muslims but with a different characteristic. But some other (including many Banis) disagree with the classification of Bani as a separate Shia Islam sect and instead insist that they are Banis and not Muslims. There is a 2006 documentary called \"A Strange Islam\" by Agnes De Feo about this community, which put their existence to spotlight.\n Question here is, are Bani people Shia Muslims or just Banis? And what kind of religion Bani is?\n    submitted by    /u/JoJo-Bizarre-1997  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: My experience in Vietnam is a treasure on my heart. \n (Rant)I spent time there a few years back. An American in your beautiful country. I think of the smells, the people, the beauty, and the food. Your kindness to me and my travel mate was second to none, from the south to the north. I know it may be required of your culture to be \"nice\" when you really want to say what needs to be said, but I saw a humble care of the world in which the Vietnamese live, which includes naive tourists. Always kind to me, which I am not used to.\n As an American, I am so thankful for your hospitality. From my perspective, I would have so much animosity towards people like me. Maybe you keep it to yourselves. Or maybe, you just want to move on. A humble strength in family and kindess. \n Vietnam is one of my fondest memories. I treasure it. I spent a night on a boat in Ha Long Bay. Although I was drunk and silly, the crew invited me and my girlfriend to the kitchen. Vietnamese food and a strange, ridiculously strong sangria. One of the greatest experiences in my life. It was like 345 in the morning!\n I got to sleep in. And the crew, who I think several were celebrating birthdays, were up at like 5! Being hungover on a boat while working sounds impossible. They did it, cause they had to. Tourism is likely the (I don't know) biggest money makers for Vietnam these days I imagine.\n My last night, I got a tattoo on my inner left forearm in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh). I hear that many people tired of their tattoos when they see them everyday. For me? I wax nostalgic and think of how amazing Vietnam was. How it is. And how it treated me and my friend. \n Not only do I have a great experience. But the people of Vietnam make me want to be a better person. I try everyday. Be humble. Be kind. Make good pho. Regrettably, the latter tastes like salty water. I'll keep trying.\n I miss Vietnam. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/PeterCushingsTriad  \n [link]   [comments]",
