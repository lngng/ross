          "description": "The two eastern divisions (north-east: Sylhet, south-east: Chittagong) of Bangladesh (preferably, I'd want the whole of Bangladesh to join, but idk...) to join Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to form one single united country (you may look at the map of Asia for some context if you want). I'd preferably want there to be two capitals, the western capital and the eastern capital, The western capital could be either Sylhet or Chittagong (Chattogram) and the eastern capital could be either Bangkok or Hanoi. I personally think that it would be great. I mean, look at India, it has different cultures and languages/language-families (Indo-European, Dravidian etc.).. I want these countries that I mentioned to be one country for the greater good (of humanity). Even if they were to merge, they would not be as big in size as China, India or the USA but they would be bigger in size than as they are presently.These countries that I mentioned are all connected by land, not just the water (for some more context, for those reading and looking to get it). If anyone else on here who sees this also wants this to happen, please feel free to give some suggestions and let's gather some ideas on seeing if this could actually go forth.\n P.S.: I haven't thought of a name for the proposed country yet.\n    submitted by    /u/BobbyGoldenheim  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have spent time all over the country and have been to Ho Chi Minh, Da Lat, Nha Trang, Da Nang and Hoi An. Every city have had its unique feeling and I have loved it so far.\n Now I'm finally in Ha Long, this was supposed to be the real tropical paradise stop with beaches and swimming. Boating through the unique Islands in the bay and just relax before going to Hanoi for the flight back home. \n I decided to go on a bot trip while in Ha Long and just enjoy the almost mystical atmosphere you get boating through the bay between hundreds of small rocky islands.But this absolutely broke my heart, instead of a mystical and paradise like environment we got nothing but waters absolutely full of trash. \n It didn't matter where you looked, it was just full of mostly styrofoam blocks and other plastic waste, but also some random wood and other garbage also floating around. And I'm not surprised that the waters are so littered, there where hundreds of tourist boats in the bay at any given time. Unfortunately this seem to partly be because of over tourism in the bay, and going through Ha Long city there seem to be alot of relatively new developments but 70% of it looked to be empty or abandoned. \n I am just a tourist that get to see this city for a limited time, can anyone from the area tell me more about how you perceive the city's and they bays development over the past few years. And if you have toured Ha Long just as me and have similar or very contrasting experiences, please share. \n Love from Sweden 🇸🇪\n    submitted by    /u/granatfarfar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found some posts that said 50$ a day would be sufficient if I stay in hostels, hitchhike, and take the bus places. (That was including lodging). Does this hold true?\n Things to do: as I have no idea what Vietnam is like i plan to soak up as much as possible. I’m told any and all caves are worth a visit. Is there anyone out there who has been to Vietnam before and is willing to share or send me their itinerary? I can taylor it to my needs but i would be forever greatful to you kind stranger. \n If I want to travel to a different country after Vietnam has anyone had experience applying for a multi trip visa? (Google can probably answer that one for me but there’s nothing better than first hand knowledge).\n Any and all wisdom is greatly appreciated. I plan to Only bring a 40-50L backpack too. Is this feesable.? Experienced backpackers, any pointers on what I should pack and how many of each item? I tend to over pack so I would probably do 2 weeks worth of clothes if I can fit it in the backpack but if someone is able to get away with less then i‘d happily pack lighter.\n    submitted by    /u/throwing_tea  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is that I can't seem to figure out which one to choose...\n Le Theatre has a great dinner place with a piano and good outdoor areas on top, but I have seen comments about degradation problems and it not being very clean.\n Scarlet Pearl seems to be very new and clean, but it may have fewer outdoor areas...\n As for the itinerary, I think both are equivalent.\n Which one do you guys think I should choose?\n Thanks! 😁\n    submitted by    /u/hugofpaiva  \n [link]   [comments]",

Và từ đó trở đi + nhiều chuyện nữa, tôi luôn có một nỗi lo với những người lớn tuổi hơn, tôi luôn ám ảnh việc người khác nghĩ gì về bản thân, tôi sợ người khác hiểu nhầm mình.

The main reason is that there is not much to do, and nowhere worth going to eat. \n It obviously depends on what you like, but if it includes meat, you wont be getting that. Almost all meat here is not what it is advertised as, and will likely destroy your stomach the next day. We spent hours researching restaurants to eat at and compared to the rest of Vietnam, they are really quite pathetic. 4.7-5 star reviews on many restaurant are just an absolute joke. \n Da Lat is a picturesque city with a nice climate this time of year. The hotels are all a bit tired and run down but that is to be expected considering the location. There are some nice bars hidden away for people to discover and you can do some small touristy activities like Crazy House, Coaster, Bike trips but that's about it. \n It is interesting that there are not many honest reviews containing criticism of any places in this country.\n    submitted by    /u/Ripstart01  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I've been living here for over a year now and I'm curious to know what are some recommended insurance plans that other Americans use that won't break the bank. When I first came here I had world nomads, but they turned out to be no good after I was hospitalised and didn't plan on returning home anytime back to the states. They said that exempt me from getting my claim. Then I had Safetywing but they are more of a (you pay now and file a claim and we will send you the money later) kind of deal. I'm living in HCMC and am just looking for a good insurance plan I can rely on if I do get injured and I can just go to the hospital (Probably Vinmec) and just get helped on the spot no questions asked. Can anyone give me any recommendations?\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_X_90s  \n [link]   [comments]",

Vietnamese considers a lot of \"sausage meat\" related food \"Nem\" like in Nem Nuong and Nem Ran and I'm not sure if Thai and Lao people consider other meat Nem/Naem like in Vietnamese. I've done some research and fermented sausage eaten raw is unique to South East Asia so it would make sense if they come from a similar origin somewhere in South East Asia as opposed to the cooked Lap Xuong that comes from China.\n    submitted by    /u/KyloBish  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm wondering about how some of the Indigenous religious traditions overlap (if at all) as I reconnect with precolonial heritage.\n A lot of the articles I read seem to put more emphasis on Len Dong / spirit mediumship happening in the North but also with a handful of practitioners in diaspora like in California of the US who have been trained or came into the role through heredity (e.g. family has a history of it).\n For Ca Ong/whale worship, a lot of coastal villages including the one part of my family came from still do it, but we're disconnected from the culture due to deaths in the family and immigration away from the country. And it seems each village celebrates their festival differently at different moons (TraVinh where some of my relatives were from for example is supposedly on the 3rd lunar month, others do the 6th), and some blend Buddhist traditions with the mourning of a deceased whale, while others remain rooted in Cham culture, and others potentially adopted the Nguyen Dynasty's official policies to worship Can Ong but kept their own local practices too.\n So I'm wondering what the ceremonies and protocols are like, and if the two religions ever overlap, what the ceremonies entail, and what route might be good to inquire further to connect with first.\n    submitted by    /u/messyredemptions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Wiring/bank transfer of the money would be our safest bet I am assuming. If this is the case, will I be able to open a bank account in Vietnam with only a family visa? I am not able to get Vietnam citizenship reinstated. However my wife is, and she is currently waiting on the paper work to be finished. The property will be the in-law’s name. So I am not worried about loosing said property. Next question that I have is once money is in hand, in Vietnam, what is normally done/happens to transfer the title? Is it a red flag if a newly built condo does not have the red book,title? I was told that this is because the condo was recently built and at this time all units are not sold or finished yet. Though I do know that people have been living in that building for ả least 5 years. One would think that my in-laws would be able to answer these questions. But they have been living outside of Vietnam for 40 years. And I have no close relative alive in Vietnam to ask. Please excuse any poor wording or grammatical errors.

I have my local vinmart, and another vinmart down the road and a circle k. I have to say, my experience of customer service has been the worst I have ever experienced. At the one store, the same girl (in her late 20's), just looks at me and has this look of contempt, of anger almost, grabs my items, scans them then points to the screen in a really 'I can't be bothered, hurry up' way. She grabs my card scans it, prints the receipt and just hands it to me, not even a smile, a nod, a goodbye, no eye contact. The other day she takes the basket and just throws it on the floor. Then again, tonight, the other store, I go in, the young man didn't say one word to me the entire time. No hello, no thank you, no goodbye (in Vietnamese.. I don't expect English)... And just slammed the receipt on the table and continued chatting. My question is, are these people taught by their companies to observe any form of customer service? Is it because they are shy? (even though they stare at me and even once sighed at me for taking too long to use my phone app to pay even though their card machine wasn't working)? Is it because they have no idea what to say to foreigners? Because I've been to other countries and a simple head nod, or even small gesture to acknowledge the customer and make him or her feel welcome isn't so difficult is it? Now I rather hate going shopping now. It is not an enjoyable situation and I'm wondering if anyone else has the same experience in Hanoi. As a customer spending money in these stores I feel entitled to some form of customer service. I dont expect much, but a simple xin Chào, cam on or even a smile to the foreigners who are living and working hard here (or even tourists spending their money here) isn't so difficult...

He said it’s pretty common for people mistake it for Jim.

In fact, for all of my mother's relatives in the US (most came during the mid-late 1990s), none of them went above Nha Trang and half of them only visited Vietnam once or twice afterwards.\n Despite the fact I have only lived in Vietnam for 5 years before moving to Russia to study in 2006 and subsequently moving to the US at 11 in 2012, I have visited Vietnam several times afterwards (my most recent trip was in 2019 by the way), and I have visited the following places:\n Ca Mau, Can Tho, Long Xuyen, Ben Tre, Vung Tau, HCMC, Tay Ninh, Phan Thiet, Dalat, Nha Trang, Buon Ma Thuot, Tuy Hoa, Quy Nhon, Pleiku, Quang Ngai, Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Vinh, Thanh Hoa, Nam Dinh, Hanoi, Hai Duong, Haiphong, Ha Long, Thai Nguyen, Sapa\n ​\n  \nI am curious if it is common for Vietnamese people to have never visited the Northern half (North of 16/17 parallel)\n Plus, how common is it for Vietnamese Americans to never return to Vietnam or only return there once since moving to the US\n  \n   submitted by    /u/MussleGeeYem  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Xin chào!\n I am visiting Hanoi from now until friday, the 31st of april, and I am interested in getting a custom tailored mens suit! I just want a jacket and pants, but if the price is good I could be convinced to get a shirt and/or vest too. I am thinking of choosing a charcoal wool/wool blend material.\n I am in my mid-20s but want it to be a versatile suit, so nothing either super vintage nor super modern; Regular length and medium-width notched lapels for the jacket and a slim-straight cut for the pants would be ideal. I also would like the suit to have some stretch, as I often get uncomfortable with the restrictive/stiff feel of store-bought suits.\n My budget would ideally be 5million VND, but a lot of talk online about this stuff is from pre-covid times, so I don't know if that is a realistic number. Please correct my expectations if they are unrealistic.\n What tailors would be appropriate for what I am looking for, and what prices can I expect? Also: do I need to buy the fabric separately on my own, or will that be included in the tailor bill? Or would it be cheaper to buy on my own? \n Any and all advice is much appreciated!

          "description": "Hi everyone, I’m taking a trip to Vietnam soon and trying to workout my itinerary and would love some advice!\n So on the 4th of May, the plan is to take the night train from Dong Hoi up to Tam Coc. I’ve realised maybe 1 day is not enough for Tam Coc. Plus it’s a long journey from Tam Coc up to Ha Giang…\n After Tam Coc, the plan was to do the Ha Giang loop, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, however if we stay the extra day in Tam Coc, plus the long journey, I’m not sure we will have 4 days to do the loop. \n We have to be in Hai Phong Bay at 11:30am on Monday 10th for a trip to Cat Ba.\n So here is my question:\n Should we skip Tam Coc all together, get up to Ha Giang and just do the loop for as long as we can? Should we do the 2 days in Tam Coc and just do a smaller loop of Ha Giang? Should I stick to 1 day in Tam Coc and the 4 day loop of Ha Giang?\n It looks like if we decide to go to Tam Coc, we will have to get a night bus up to Ha Giang. And of course then another night bus from Ha Giang down to Hanoi. Lot of night travel - is it too much? Should we ease up and save stuff for another visit?\n Thanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/SintHollow  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’re doing a relatively budget holiday so staying in a cheapesh place half an hour walk away from the beach.\n Most of the other discussion I see mention resorts for beaches but are the public beaches here good? My wife suffers a bit from too much sun so we wouldn’t mind having umbrellas and facilities at the beaches! \n We will also spend a couple of days towards the south west of the island if anyone jas recommendations?\n Thanks a lot in advace!\n    submitted by    /u/swiftmen991  \n [link]   [comments]",

My only concern is the internet speed, as my job relies heavily on Zoom meetings. Last time the connection was bumpy, I had some serious issues one day and I am concerned.

Around week 5, we are hoping to take a 5 day trip round the Ha giang loop, and I wanted to discuss the logistics of this here. A few notes:\n  \nneither of us have ridden a motorcycle/moped before, but are confident car drivers. We have access to a 100cc motorbike for practice\n both of our UK drivers licences cover \"AM\" vehicles (motorbikes smaller than 50cc) but to ride up to 175cc, we need an A1 licence\n we plan to rent motorbikes in the islands of Thailand earlier in our trip, and gauge whether we think it is feasible to carry out 5 days of driving.\n We will be doing the Ha Giang Loop in early May\n  \nI guess my biggest question is what are our options?\n Should we try to get an A1 licence before we go? (It only takes a day AFAIK so we should be able to sort it before the trip) if we bother doing this, will we be able to get an IDP that works? I've heard conflicting reports regarding the state of IDPs\n Should we go as we are? In this case we'll need to pay off police I'm sure which isn't a huge deal but I'd be worried about getting our bikes impounded, especially half way through the loop\n Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/quantThrowAway22  \n [link]   [comments]",

Viet life is just viewed as a source of turmoil to me sometimes.\n If you also feel this way about being Viet, please comment your emotions below.\n I know some people who have a good and healthy relationship to being Viet, but I'd consider them to be few. I'd really like to have a better relationship to being Viet, because I feel like a lot of us hate ourselves. Historically, it looks like a lot of us have just wanted to attach ourselves to other larger empires, such as China, France, or America. And, that makes me kinda sad. \n The few people that I know that have a positive relationship to being Vietnamese come from good, healthy families. But, our community has a lot of trauma, and, to me, that makes those good families become uncommon.\n    submitted by    /u/justnobodyhehe  \n [link]   [comments]",

To compensate our daughter a bit for all the walking and looking at things, we had considered visiting the Aquatopia water park. As we know by now, the free shuttle bus has been discontinued, but we found out that the public bus #11 (which also runs from the airport) goes close enough to the cable car station. Only unfortunately it seems that the bus is also no longer running, at least I can't find any information about it on the net (not even on the airport page). Has anyone ridden the bus lately or knows that it no longer exists? If it runs, we would look for a hotel along the bus line, otherwise we go, as actually planned, to Ong Lang and forget the thing with the park simply (I have no desire to pay 60€ for cabs to Cable Station and back, then we rather invest the money in as much ice cream as she can eat...).

We all know and love Pho and Banh Mi, but there's so much more to the Vietnamese breakfast scene that often goes unnoticed. Recently, I've discovered a lesser-known but absolutely mouthwatering dish: Banh Cuon Cao Bang! 😋\n For those who haven't tried it yet, Banh Cuon Cao Bang is a delicate and savory rice noodle roll filled with minced pork, wood ear mushrooms, and shallots. It's usually served with a side of fresh herbs, cucumber, and a tasty dipping sauce. It has quickly become my go-to breakfast choice, and I'm eager to find more dishes like this!\n So, fellow foodies, I'm asking you: What are your favorite Vietnamese breakfasts, particularly the lesser-known ones? Let's uncover some hidden culinary gems together and share our love for Vietnamese cuisine. Please share your favorites and any stories or memories you have associated with them. If you have any secret spots or recipes, feel free to share as well!\n Looking forward to reading your responses and expanding my breakfast horizons! 🍽️\n Cheers and happy eating! 🥢\n    submitted by    /u/DragonXDT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi r/Vietnam!\n I'm currently looking into getting the best out of my Phin filter as I recently got a decent hand grinder. People over at r/coffee tend to be pour-over and aeropress guys so I don't read much about other brewing methods there. That's why I decided to ask here. :)\n Any tips on getting the best brew? I personally haven't tweaked much from what I usually do these past months when I first had a phin: Grind 14g of beans using setting 3 (medium fine) for my 6 click cheapo grinder that I bought over at Shopee, preheat the brewer and the glass, dump the grounds on the brewing chamber and shake to level, drop the press filter and press a bit (this one I'm not sure if necessary), pour hot-off-the-boil water about twice the volume of the coffee into the chamber to bloom the grounds and wait for 30 seconds, pour water to the brim of the chamber, then cover to retain the heat. Drip finishes at around 6 mins.\n I usually make coffee via pour-over and I love the different nuances in the process and how each factor affects the output of the brew, But I love the simplicity of the Phin and how no non-sense it is -it's brute force coffee.\n Also, what should I look for if I want to buy a better Phin filter? And if you are a Timemore C2 user, what is your current grind setting?\n I would love to hear from you guys. :) Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Bibingka_Malagkit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here are my requirements:\n - Easy rider who drives safe and is friendly\n - Small group tour (max 8 people)\n - Staying in authentic homestays \n - Off the beaten path/away from other tourists as much as possible (acknowledging that I am a tourist myself)\n - 4 days/3 nights would be ideal but open to slightly longer\n Also, I will be coming from Sa Pa, so any advice about transport between Sa Pa and Ha Giang is welcome. Thanks so much!\n    submitted by    /u/Recent_Reply_7840  \n [link]   [comments]",

We wanted to get married next year but we will be 33* (Vietnamese age plus 1 year for Tet) which is a no go according to her mum. I think we then said let’s do it this year but that was also bad and realistically my family couldn’t make it to Vietnam this year. However, we didn’t want to wait until 2025. So after some consultation with a pháp sư her mum said this year was ok and we will have ancestor welcoming (me?) into the family this year on the day of our legal marriage abroad and the wedding ceremony in Vietnam next year, but since it’s unlucky we are just having a “party” not a wedding ceremony.

We’ve only been dating a couple months, but I’ve already met his parents, and while they are very kind to me, I haven’t had a full real conversation with them. It’s always in passing that we exchange words. I’m white and don’t know much about Vietnamese culture or customs, so I’m not sure exactly how to approach them for fear of accidentally coming off as rude or ignorant. I love my boyfriend a lot, and I go to his house and see them pretty often. He doesn’t have a very close relationship with his family, and even they don’t talk much outside of them asking if he’s eaten or where he is, so I’m not sure if he’d be able to help me here. It means a lot to me, having them like me, as I see us having a long future together. Does anyone have any tips or things I should know/necessary knowledge like what is or is not respectful? Or gift ideas to thank them for letting me stay at their house? Anything would be great. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/music-luvr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The Chams, if I remember right, with the fall of Champa, were separated into three groups practising different religions. The Central Chams have largely retained their Hindu belief, although this is practised under a form called \"Ba La Mon\". The Southern Chams in the Mekong Delta have largely adhered to Sunni Islam and they are the only ethnic group in Vietnam to be Muslims.\n The third Cham group, however, practise a complex religion called \"Bani\". It was thought to be traced from Persian traders (Persia/Iran was converted to Shia Islam by Shah Ismail I), who spread their Shia Islam to the community during the Vietnamese shogunates (Trinh-Nguyen). However, Bani is unique that it is so synchronised with other religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and even Han and Kinh (Vietnamese) people's folk traditions that it lost most of the original Islamic belief.\n The Bani community is small today but their religious practise has ignited discussions. Some groups believed that they are actually Muslims but with a different characteristic. But some other (including many Banis) disagree with the classification of Bani as a separate Shia Islam sect and instead insist that they are Banis and not Muslims. There is a 2006 documentary called \"A Strange Islam\" by Agnes De Feo about this community, which put their existence to spotlight.\n Question here is, are Bani people Shia Muslims or just Banis? And what kind of religion Bani is?\n    submitted by    /u/JoJo-Bizarre-1997  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: My experience in Vietnam is a treasure on my heart. \n (Rant)I spent time there a few years back. An American in your beautiful country. I think of the smells, the people, the beauty, and the food. Your kindness to me and my travel mate was second to none, from the south to the north. I know it may be required of your culture to be \"nice\" when you really want to say what needs to be said, but I saw a humble care of the world in which the Vietnamese live, which includes naive tourists. Always kind to me, which I am not used to.\n As an American, I am so thankful for your hospitality. From my perspective, I would have so much animosity towards people like me. Maybe you keep it to yourselves. Or maybe, you just want to move on. A humble strength in family and kindess. \n Vietnam is one of my fondest memories. I treasure it. I spent a night on a boat in Ha Long Bay. Although I was drunk and silly, the crew invited me and my girlfriend to the kitchen. Vietnamese food and a strange, ridiculously strong sangria. One of the greatest experiences in my life. It was like 345 in the morning!\n I got to sleep in. And the crew, who I think several were celebrating birthdays, were up at like 5! Being hungover on a boat while working sounds impossible. They did it, cause they had to. Tourism is likely the (I don't know) biggest money makers for Vietnam these days I imagine.\n My last night, I got a tattoo on my inner left forearm in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh). I hear that many people tired of their tattoos when they see them everyday. For me? I wax nostalgic and think of how amazing Vietnam was. How it is. And how it treated me and my friend. \n Not only do I have a great experience. But the people of Vietnam make me want to be a better person. I try everyday. Be humble. Be kind. Make good pho. Regrettably, the latter tastes like salty water. I'll keep trying.\n I miss Vietnam. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/PeterCushingsTriad  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know my mom uses tough love on us but I’m not sure if my mom went out of line disciplining my sister and me.\n These are some of the things she did:\n  \nShe spat and bit me after I didn’t want to wear formal clothes to my friend’s birthday party at age 8. She then clapped and laughed at me after poking holes on my pants with scissors. I cried so hard that day.\n \nShe cut my pajama pants for refusing to wear anything above the knees.\n \nTold me “it was such a huge mistake giving birth to you”.\n \nPour food on head after refusing to eat( I was three at that time).\n \nBeat my sister so hard she bled from her mouth when she was 4-5 y.o.\n \nKicked me in the back.\n \nCalled me “thang dong tinh”( similar to the f-slur) and splashed tea at me for reason number 2 (luckily the tea was cold at that time).\n \nScreamed and calling me “thang cho”( a dog) for not bringing a ruler to school.\n \n This happened to me when I was 6-12 y.o. My sister told me my mother was abusive but I don’t think she was since I’ve seen some of my Vietnamese relatives’ parents who did stuffs way worse than my mom did.\n    submitted by    /u/taytaykosho2003  \n [link]   [comments]",

My parents are from mixed backgrounds, dad a boat refugee from a military family and mom a very upperclass business family in real estate. I've considered moving back after getting a job offer but ultimately decided not to purely because it wouldn't further my career, at least not in the industry I'm in. Really did consider it though since I got lots of family there too\n That being said, I do have very mixed feelings of the current government. On one hand, they freed us from all our colonizers which is something I think all of us feel very proud of and it just feels liberating, you know, knowing…",

          "description": "Sorry if this is not an appropriate place to post this, but I wasn’t sure what other subreddit to post this to.\n I met a Vietnamese guy on a tour last year in South America. We stayed in touch and when I went over to Thailand, we decided to meet up there. I’ve noticed that he is not that polite to hotel and restaurant staff as well as drivers. For example, he doesn’t say thank you when staff brings his drink or food to the table ever. He doesn’t say thank you when we are leaving the restaurant and they are saying thank you and goodbye. He’s not mean to them or anything, he simply ignores them. We hired a driver and instead of walking a few meters to meet the driver, he insisted the driver come into a very tight spot even though it was super inconvenient for the driver to have to back out. I tried to tell him we can just walk up to a more convenient spot and he said no, that we are paying the guy so we will wait for him to come to us.\n I’m wondering if this is just a cultural thing? I am ethnically Vietnamese, however I grew up in the US and my attitude is completely different (I’ve also worked in the hospitality industry so maybe I’m hypersensitive to this). I grew up being taught to be extra nice to hospitality workers because they work very hard but make very little. I get a sense from him that he sees them as beneath them.

One guy spent the entire night spreading his legs right and left, and doing so, he was touching my bottom all night long. I could not sleep because it made me feel really inconfortable. I tried many times to push his legs, but he would do it again, and again and again. \n I don't understand, because I thought it was very disrespectful to touch people of the opposite sex?\n Is it normal? How should I react if it happens again? Can I ask him to stop doing it or would he be angry? \n Thank you for your answers\n    submitted by    /u/Coriolys12  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Serious question here. Why do so many Vietnamese burn garbage? Outside of the traffic situation, burning of things and the resulting air pollution it causes is without a doubt the most negative aspect of this amazing country. I don’t get it as everything I have seen on fire could have easily been put on virtually any curb for pickup by the garbage crews at least in the cities where smoke impacts a lot of people. \n It makes me so mad as it not only affects my health, but more so, that of babies and children who are more vulnerable plus ALL of you who live here. Why is this not something the government is cracking down on as the trickle down health effects surely are taking a toll on the nation...even just cognatively as it effects your brain too. Plus, who wants to constantly be getting whiffs of burning plastics and whatnot on the daily? It is 2023 and we KNOW better, so why the ignorance in this particular area here? \n If you burn things on the regular basis…why? Can you please shed some light as to your motivations? \n From Wikipedia:\n “The World Health Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.[6] Studies published in March 2019 indicated that the number may be around 8.8 million.[127] A 2022 review concluded that air pollution was responsible for 6.67 (5.90–7.49) million premature deaths in 2019. It concluded that since 2015 little real progress against (superordinate) pollution, which remained at ~9 million earlier deaths, can be identified.[128][19]00090-0-19) Causes of deaths include strokes, heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections.[6]\"\n    submitted by    /u/immersive-matthew  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hoping someone has some experience on what may be the best approach. For my last two days in Vietnam, I'm struggling to decide on two different scenarios. I'm not deterred by long days and aim to do as much as I can. I've heard Ha Long Bay is more touristy, so I'd like to avoid that if possible. But here are what I've found to be the best scenarios - so if there are other options that I am not thinking of, please share!\n Option One: Day trip excursion from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay. Lasts ~12 hours and allows me to book another one day excursion from Hanoi for the second day. I feel like this will result in roughly 6 hours total of travel back and forth for each day, so seems like I am not getting the most out of my days. But, may allow me to see something else I haven't considered for a day trip.\n Option Two: Depart early AM via train or bus to Cat Ba Island, arriving midday. This allows some brief exploration of Cat Ba National Park. However, the following day it is unclear to be me if I can actually see Lan Hay Bay. I will be leaving out of Hanoi at 2300hrs that night, so need to be back to the airport around 2000hrs. It looks like my options to get back to mainland are to ferry at 1530hrs (ending my day prematurely) or at 1730hrs (getting back too late). Would it even be possible for me to see Lan Ha Bay in this time? The only thing I've found only is departing from 0800 and not arriving back to the island until 1500, which means my only option would be to take the ferry back at 1730. I'd like to make this option work, if I can, to see the mostt of the island but looks like the timing doesn't quite work :(\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Triggerboom0306  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear all,\n I wanted to kindly ask for any advice and recommendations regarding possible job opportunities in the tourism/hotel sector of Da Nang/Hoi An. I am 32 years old, originally from Germany. I have BA degree in Southeast Asian and American Studies. I am considering to do a second degree in Tourism/Hotel-Management at an online university in order to be able to work while studying. \n My overall CV has a lot of \"holes\" in it, because in my 20s I spent quit a fair amount of time traveling around the globe. I worked seven years as a freelance journalists with a main emphasis on tourism; had countless jobs in restaurants; worked for a company specialized in book trade; and, more recently, been employed as a social worker at a school in Germany. I also have my own little side hustle going on, selling records/cds/cassettes. In addition, I speak Indonesian and Malay, and I am currently trying to advance my Vietnamese language skills. \n In the near and distant future, I'd like to live and work in Da Nang. I spent a fair amount of time in the city in the recent decade, and I feel very much at home there. My girlfriend lives in Da Nang, too, and we are in committed long term relationship. Therefore, I am considering to find a suitable occupation for myself in the city, and I can picture myself doing a good job in the tourism sector. Online, though, I can barely find any job ads. \n I'd be very grateful if anyone could give me some honest feedback if I'd be able to get a work permit in the tourism sector in Da Nang with my background; and if so, I'd appreciate any tips on what to keep in mind, what to be careful about, and so forth. \n Thank you so much in advance! =)\n    submitted by    /u/bluebirdlarry  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! The title kinda speaks for itself. I'm in Vietnam at the moment and whilst here I was hoping to find some factory seconds from brands that I would normally find back home in Australia. Specifically, Vivobarefoot (a barefoot shoe brand), Patagonia, Arcteryx, North Face, etc. I'm in the north near Hanoi but I'm happy to travel!\n Any information or sharing of contacts would be appreciated. I'm not looking to resell, and I'm mostly needing the gear for trekking. The shoe brand for instance, they are one of the only brands that manafactures in my size (US15), so if I could stock up whilst here that would be helpful.

I just bought a set of cards that I had seen a group of Vietnamese women play a few days ago, and wanted to learn the rules but I can’t find anything convincing on internet (the rules found in Wikipedia don’t make much sense). Anyone has a link to the rules of Tam cúc (which is, I think, the game they were playing, as they had these thin Chinese cards)?\n Thanks a bunch! Will keep on looking online in case I find anything.\n Extra question: anyone knows where to import to Europe the cool plastic or wooden stools found at the street food stalls/bars?\n Edit: If someone knows the rules, could I send a DM with my doubts on the rules found online?\n    submitted by    /u/Roschien  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am very time restricted and only have 12 full days to complete this ride. Is it possible to do this? Am I an idiot for even considering this? Will I make it in time considering weather etc?

My other options are Hanoi itself or maybe Da Nang. I am, however, scared that these cruises are full of closed groups or families and I end up having a not-so-pleasant experience. \n For those who did this already, what do you think?

          "description": "Hi! \n Are there any shops in Hanoi selling old (used) comics, books and magazines?\n When i'm abroad i'm always looking for comic books in the native language, especially Donald Duck (Donald và bạn hữ) but also the franco-belgian stuff like Tintin, Lucky Luke and Asterix. It seems all this series were published in Vietnam at least two decades ago but not any longer. I guess Mangas are the big thing now.\n A couple of years ago (2017?) in HCMC i stumbled across a street (can't remember which district) with shop on shop where old magazines were pieled up in front. I found a lot of stuff but it was just the first week of our trip and my wife would've killed me if we had to carry a ton of comics for a month...\n Are there any of these shops in Hanoi. I've been to Đinh Lễ Street and Nhà sách Mão already (these pop up when you google). But all i got was one new Tintin at Trang Tien bookstore. A lot of shops i found on Google Maps which seemed very promissing are actually closed (Covid i guess).\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/cmd_rikers_brother  \n [link]   [comments]",

I guess shit hit the fan, cause then they pulled up in a limo to the airport, and the other gang got off the airplane, and they just started fighting.

The question concerns them.\n Due to circumstances they put their properties in the name of a relative who still lives in Vietnam, but now they wish to change that. Because they no longer have their citizenship papers, and it takes a long time to get them again, they cannot put the properties in their names. What sort of options do they have?\n I was wondering if there was a kind of trust they could use to own the property, but have the trust be controlled by them, or, at the very least, have it be controlled by a relative still in Vietnam, but with their name attached in some way that requires their consent for anything to be done to the property. They are old and probably too trusting, I want to see if there is any way we can help protect their interests as well as possible.
