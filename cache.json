          "description": "If so, why?\n There is too many upsides to getting a Vietnamese passport, and NOT enough downsides.\n - The visa situation will get more stringent over time. Look at what happened post-COVID. One day, you will NOT be allowed to do infinite border runs, even on your 5-year visa exemption. Pre-COVID, it was VERY easy to renew your tourist visa inside the country. Post-COVID, much harder. Look at Thailand ... they charge $24K USD for their 5-year tourist visa (\"Thai elite visa\")\n - Vietnam's GDP rising.\n - Opening a business is easier. You don't need a Vietnamese partner who owns 51% share of the company\n My prediction is, it will only get HARDER & harder to get a Vietnamese passport as Vietnam's GDP rises ... just look at Vietnam's visa policy -- it's already hard for non-ASEAN tourists to get a visa.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Odd_Introduction9656  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Apparently, Vietnamese pronouns are really hard for many learners, so I decided to make that one of the first things I'd tackle in the language. Correct me if my explanation is wrong.\n Vietnamese has a few pronouns, of course. The pronoun for I is fairly common, for instance. However, it seems like Vietnamese likes to avoid using true first and second person pronouns, like other Asian languages. However, that means you need some other way to distinguish yourself and different people in conversations.\n Vietnamese chooses age and gender. You imagine that this person is a part of your family and choose a pronoun for you and a pronoun for them that agrees. For example, I would call myself big brother if I'm talking to a little girl and call her little sibling, and she would do that in reverse.\n Here's a chart I made with all the different pronouns: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1WGMQL-_9XU14HV8i4OgvW0fiPY50n4OUcoNOS0q8U/edit?usp=sharing\n I honestly think it's a fascinating system. You get to show respect for the listener in more ways than tu/vous in French, but you also don't have to change the entire sentence, like you would in Korean.\n    submitted by    /u/ilemworld2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I went check out this house this week and was shown around by this friendly vietnamese woman around my age in her 30s. There was a guy renovating the house who was also super friendly and chatty. I soon realized they were probably together despite the fact it was odd as he could pass as her dad. He's a local, not an immigrant. She has a kid too.\n So days go by when I haven't made up my mind so I send her a message asking if said room is still up for grabs. She says it's been taken. But then proceeds to send me a message saying One thing I want to say to you is you are really handsome and have such a beautiful smile.

So he is living on an investor TRC & visa. 4 years ago, he had to renew his tourist visa once or twice by leaving Vietnam to Cambodia then entering Vietnam again.\n He now has trouble entering Vietnam as his entry date was on the old expired passport and he is holding his new passport. So at the Cambodia - Vietnam border, they didn't issue him the new visa for Vietnam. He went home, brought his old passport over and still they didn't issue him the visa because they couldn't find the stamp for his TRC on his passport. (what does this mean please help me explain this)\n He has to go to the HCM Immigration office for help. Now I have some questions:\n - Can a foreigner live in VN forever with just tourist visa? How many time can one leave and enter Vietnam on tourist visa? Can he do this for the rest of his life?\n - Can someone work remotely for a foreign country but want to live in Vietnam? What kind of paperwork he needs to be able to get a residence permit here?\n - How long an investor TRC last? Can one keep using his investor visa/TRC for multiple entries in Vietnam?\n - Can someone be a criminal (maybe not wanted) in their country or other country and can enter Vietnam without being recognized?\n - Can one commit a crime in the past and be able to apply for a job in Vietnam?\n - What kind of job can grant one a work permit?

I have a Wells Fargo Visa debit card and CitiBank MasterCard credit card; I am from the USA. I know most tourists pay in cash in Vietnam, but I am worried that my debit card won’t work at ATMs to withdraw cash. Unfortunately, I probably don’t have time to open a new debit card. \n In addition, I am not sure of how to book through apps like Booking.com, Hostelworld, Grab, 12go, etc. Grab doesn’t seem to accept my USA visa debit card. I have been able to book a couple hostels with my US card but unsure if it will work once I land in Vietnam. \n I predict I will spend $1-1.2k USD, but obviously don’t want to just carry that much cash to be converted to VND all at once. Maybe I will take $200 cash.\n Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Personal-Elevator-88  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am thinking of exploring Hanoi, areas in the North, and not going any further south than perhaps Hoi An. We don’t want to rush too much so would prefer to stick to 3 to 4 places. I have some questions that I would appreciate some help with:\n  \nHa Giang: We would really love to do the loop on our own but are not experienced on motorbikes so can’t really make that happen. We aren’t into guided tours so wondering if there is an alternative way to enjoy Ha Giang without doing the loop. Trekking perhaps? We are experienced overnight trekkers and like big days such as 10-15 miles per day hiking. Is trekking a good alternative to motorbiking the loop in Ha Giang? If so, can we do this on our own or would we need a trekking guide? To add, we aren’t against hiring a private guide for certain things, especially if it allows us to learn more about the area, just aren’t into big group tours.\n Ninh Binh or Mai Chau: My partner gets sick on boats and we also don’t really like overrun places so considering skipping Ha Long Bay. Would you perhaps recommend Ninh Binh or Mai Chau as an alternative for a few days? If you could only go to one, which would it be?\n Phong Nha Ke Bang: I would really like to go here but I know November is the rainy season there. Is it still worth trying to go? Can you do trekking or some of the caves without a guide or are guides required? I was planning on not going further south than Hoi An but should we perhaps try to skip some of central Vietnam and try to see somewhere drier such as Dalat?\n These are the places I would like to see but won’t have time for everything. What would you recommend removing/adding? We enjoy physical activities such as trekking, cycling, nature, sleepy towns, good food, the ability to explore by bike.\n \n  \nHanoi\n Ha Giang\n Mai Chau\n Ninh Binh\n Phong Nha Ke Bang\n Hoi An\n Dalat\n \n Thanks so much in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/DragonfruitVivid3110  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Anglish is a thought experiment about what English would sound like if it had no loanwords from Latin, Greek, French, etc. Some examples are Uncleftish Beholding (\"Atomic Theory\" - all the scientific words which are borrowings from Latin/Greek are directly translated into English), and the Anglish Moot (an Anglish Wikipedia, basically).\n I'm intrigued (as a Vietnamese person) what Vietnamese would look like if we were to do something similar - no Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary, no French and English loanwords. Expressing scientific/modern concepts (and many everyday concepts as well - such as time; \"thời gian/时间\") without Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary would be very challenging, IMO - probably because Chinese has been influencing Vietnamese longer ago, and for a longer time, than Latin/Greek/French/Old Norse have been influencing English.\n From \"Uncleftish Beholding\", which calls an electron a \"bernstonebit\" (a calque of \"electron\", which comes from the Greek for \"amber\", \"amber\" being a loanword from Arabic by way of Old French), perhaps an electron could be \"chớp con\" (a calque of Chinese 电子; Sino-Vietnamese reading điện tử). Maybe a computer could be \"óc chớp\" (calque of Chinese 电脑).

Yet, in Da Lat, this was flipped where barely 1 in 5 interactions were pleasant. This included drivers at Langbiang (a massive tourist trap, but anyway) literally running to their Jeeps and quickly driving away when asked for assistance, attendants being more pushy to payment than I've experienced elsewhere, rude staff, attendants etc., incredibly dangerous and aggressive motorcycle drivers, and shop attendants promising to help with postal/online orders than ignoring messages or giving one word replies to detailed questions (messaged in vietnamese) when followed up with. Along with your usual long stares from locals, attempted rots at tourist traps etc.\n Before people jump the gun with \"what do you expect in Vietnam/tourist place/being a forigner etc.\" I'm used to people in cities with lots of tourism being rude or just tired of the people who's income they rely on (Paris and Kyoto are notable examples), but what I experienced here was far beyond anything I have in other parts of Vietnam such as Da Nang, Hanoi or even HCMC.\n Is this something locals and other travellers have found? Do Da Lat people have a reputation for their attitude in Vietnam or did I just have several one-off experiences?\n Oh, sorry I forgot to start the post with \"I love Vietnam, its people, its culture etc. but....\", its implied \n    submitted by    /u/Fabulous-Living1889  \n [link]   [comments]",

The area consists of only hotels, probably 60-80 establishments, of which only about 12 are open and active. Almost every other building, which is multi-stories and beautifully modern, is empty and dark with nothing inside the lobbies. There are maybe 3 cafes that might be open, and maybe 3 restaurants that offer 2-3 dishes each. \n There is literally NOBODY here. In the 48 hours we have been here, we have counted about 15 other tourists on both the beach and the hotel area. Aside from that, it is completely deserted. The wide streets have almost no traffic, with a car or two (mostly taxis) going past every 15 minutes or so. \n The closest place to buy beer/snacks/smokes is over a mile away. The beach itself had 2 other people on it until about 3 pm this afternoon. Everything is closed until about 4 when 1 place on the beach opened to sell beer and snacks. \n So what gives? We understand that it is off season right now and most tourists come November- March. But this place is completely deserted. It’s almost dystopian. We have been to other places throughout south east Asia during off season and nothing compares to how completely deserted this place is. Does anyone know what is going on?\n    submitted by    /u/FreyrFatuous  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry if this question offended anyone, but I'm just genuinely curious. I can't understand why so many Vietnamese want to move to the US.\n I used to live in district 1, HCMC and there's insanely long line of people waiting at the US embassy basically everyday\n Basically all of the older people I know, and quite a few young people really like the US and want to move there.\n It's really far away, which makes flying back to visit family a huge pain. Things are also really expensive and it's getting rapidly worse. Immigration policy is strict, and it's even harder to get the green card to stay there.\n Not to mention the US has a lot of problems too. Just gonna mention 1: racism. I have heard a lot of stories about racism against Asian people in the US.\n I do think the US has quite a few things better than Vietnam, but if you can afford moving to the US then you can definitely afford moving to countless of other, much better countries. Even if just the English speaking ones, there are a few.\n My brother was obsessed with the US, moved there 8 years ago, worked really hard but still don't have green card. He is now starting to hate it and want to move to another country instead.\n My personal experience. I moved to the US and lived there for 1 year. I hated every second of it, my time there was horrible, and I was really depressed, even contemplated suicide a few times during my time there. Then I went back to Vietnam and my mood improved dramatically. After staying at home for a while I moved to Japan. Still living in Japan right now, and much happier than I ever was in the US.\n So what do you think? Please share your thoughts.\n Edit: The point of this post is not saying that Vietnam is better than living in the US. The point is why do Vietnamese people only care about and want to move to the US, while ignoring pretty much all other countries. Because if they can afford moving to the US, they can afford moving to those other countries\n    submitted by    /u/BadassMinh  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently I believe there are 3 major parties; “Maobadi” (far left, militant), Communist Party of Nepal (left), and Congress (center left). However I think a lot of younger Nepali people are starting to lose faith in leftist ideology. I am 24 now, and I feel like more and more I am shifting more towards the left politically, socially, and morally. But since you’ve guys had one of the largest revolutionary movements in history. What do YOU guys feel about it, is what I want to know. To be honest I don’t even know much about the politics of Vietnam and it’s society. So any input is valuable.

          "description": "I’m not joking. Serious question: do you guys give 70-90% of your income to your wife on monthly basis?\n I lived in Korea and Japan for 6 years and get married with a Korean woman speaking Vietnamese excellently. I often have conversations with Japanese and Korean male co workers and business partners. I swear they rarely do this. \n Since my wife and I settled down in Hanoi, she has hung out and done yoga with some Vietnamese women in the neighborhood. Then, she went home and dropped hints by telling stories like:\n “Our neighbor A’s husband sends her 90% of his monthly income, so she can manage finance of the family for him, buy what they need and do saving. He only keeps 15 mil for his personal use.”\n I know she will never directly ask me to do that. My wife is typical modern independent Korean woman having good income as professional Vietnamese-Korean translator. I keep my own money and she keeps her own money. We have a common bank account to which both of us send money for family expenses. My annual income = 5x her income, so I contribute much more. She is the person who came up with this idea, I totally agreed. She bought 70% of stuffs in our house.\n Yesterday, I saw a video on TikTok. That guy says his salary is automatically sent to his wife bank account by his company, and his wife would give enough amount of money for his living. I viewed the comments to his video, and it seems many people do this. I guess they were joking (not sure), but his video really raised my curiosity to ask this question. I am asking the same question on a Facebook group. Let’s see how many of us actually do this hehe. \n We are young family (30 husband and 28 wife). We may have the first kid next year, so a solid financial plan is a must.\n    submitted by    /u/MyNameIsYourMomName  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I’m an American traveling and got here in Da Nang. It’s Saturday night here in Da Nang. I used one of the Sacombank’s ATM and it ate my card. I called the number on the ATM and told my situation. He says I need to call my own bank and get a confirmation letter saying that it’s my card and take that letter to a Sacombank’s branch here on Monday. So I called my own bank (Citibank) and they tell me that they can only provide a Reference Letter with my account number (not the Debit Card number) and it will take a week to get that letter or they can expedite a card and send it by Tuesday. The issue is, I leave here Tuesday morning to Hanoi. That card is my only card for cash and what not. What the hell do I do?\n    submitted by    /u/Striking_Ring3863  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Went to saigon just to watch HTL vietnamese concert. I just want to see her live and check on the concern scene.\n What I observed : \n The concert venue looks like an old gymnasium with pipes on the way inside the concert grounds which is unsafe since someone can trip over. \n But the stage and production value of the concert was superb. The stage has mulple large LED display panel, smoke effects and fire effects. There are orchestra situated in the back of large display panel. There is 3 or 4 different drones on the whole duration of the concert. And multiple cameras all over the place. \n The songs performed was on her album hoang and link and the encore song is an unreleased song together with the artist in Gieo Que. \n Most of the audience are singing along with the songs and they coordinatedly changing the color of their light sticks in the color of the LED display. \n I really enjoyed the arrangement of the songs in the last 5 songs since it has a live rock band feel specially with the drummers performance. \n About HTL performance though was underwhelming. Her voice feels to me is lipsynced (or maybe overprocessed?). There is no interaction with the audience and feels that it is a performance video and not a concert. I dont know if this a vietnamese thing since most of the concert i gone to has a least interaction to the fans / audience. \n Overall i enjoyed the concert despite some flaws.\n    submitted by    /u/djsensui  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just like the title says, it's a joke. And not even a funny one. And here's my unhinged rant about it.\n Since the implementation of \"simulated situations\" test, the Vietnamese driving test has stooped to an absolute clusterfuck of bureaucratic mire, created by senile buffoons who I guaran-goddamn-tee you don't have the slightest clue what's it like to be behind the wheel.\n Here's the premise: you're given a medley of 10 clips, ranging from 40-50 seconds in length, showing situations that can happen on the road (the majority of them are half-baked 3D scenarios - how realistic). You have to press spacebar when you see a potentially dangerous action. There's a set time limit in which you have to mash the button, and you'll be graded anywhere from 0-5 depending on when you do it.\n Already this sounds like a horrible idea, knowing that there's heavy implication that your intuition can fuck right off and this is strictly a memorize-and-answer kind of test. You can see the sitch and press spacebar ZERO POINT ONE SECOND EARLY and it will be a wrong answer.\n WHO THE FUCK IN THEIR RIGHT MIND THINKS IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO FORCE FEED THIS SORT OF HORSESHIT INTO PEOPLE'S HEADS AND CALL IT A \"TEST\"???\n Apparently the Ministry of Traffic and Transports, with their infinite fucking wisdom, alongside whoever ratify the change, do.\n And the tragedy is, it's unlikely that this will be revoked, so anyone (including me) who thinks of getting a driver's license now can either suck it up or go fuck themselves.\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/DerGottbrecher  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've lived in many places\n  \nSiargao Island, PH\n La Union Beach, PH\n Baler Beach, PH\n Cebu City, PH\n Bali, ID\n Jogja / Jogja Beaches, ID\n Hua Hin, TH (just 2 months)\n  \nPhilippines used to be my home until I lost my job/home/friends during COVID. It was extremely painful for me and I never found a foot in Indonesia after the borders opened up. Being here in Da Nang is the first time since 3 years ago when I lost my home/everything that I get a sense of home and comfort even though I really can't speak the language aside from a few phrases and tones are driving me crazy lol.\n It's really nice here in Da Nang. Vietnamese people are kinder than I expected (people here say a lot of negative things about VN people), the beach is much cleaner than I expected as well. I just came from the beach and feel so refreshed. I love this city after just two days. It's a wonderful setup that allows you to walk so easily north to south and hop into random coffee shops. I wish I could make this place my home. Although probably unlikely unless I move to HCM for a job but yea, this place is so great.\n The only thing that's terrifying AF is how crazy you people drive here LOL!\n    submitted by    /u/AndiGalster  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I moved up, she inched up directly next to me. So I said “Cô, làm ơn đứng xa xa một chút giùm.” She stopped standing close to me and didn’t say anything but then started whispering about me to her husband saying “Con nhỏ mất dạy.” Like wtf did I do 😭 \n \nscenario 2: getting off the plane. I was removing my suitcase from the overhead compartment. You know viet aunties do that nudge thing if they need to get by or they’ll tap you and say move. Well this lady started to shove me aggressively. There was nowhere for me to move since the people in the row above me were in the aisle. The first one, two times I let it go, even the third. Then she kept doing it getting more aggressive each time. This is where I admit I was being really rude back. I turned to her and said “cái gì vậy.” She stopped shoving me and looked at me with full on rage in her eyes like this 😡.

Now, with my birthday approaching, I'm considering a trip to Vietnam. Initially, I was thinking of Hanoi, but a Vietnamese friend suggested Hoi An in central Vietnam.\n Choosing between the two cities is a bit challenging. I usually start with major cities before exploring smaller ones, which leans towards Hanoi. However, the idea of a more relaxed, less touristy experience in Hoi An is appealing.\n I have six days and five nights, factoring in day trips to nearby places and wanting to immerse myself in local life, so I can't visit both cities at the same time. I'm seeking advice from fellow travelers and locals on which city to begin with. I enjoy sketching buildings and nature, and exploring cafes, so finding the right backdrop for these activities is important.\n    submitted by    /u/krissy297_ph  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would love any suggestions on the itinerary below:\n November 24-26th: Hanoi November 27th: Bai Tu Long Cruise (2 day/ 1 night) November 28th: Hanoi (to rest after the cruise & leave for Sa Pa early the next day) November 29th-December 2nd: Sa Pa December 2nd-6th: Hoi An/ An Bang Beach December 7th: last night in Hanoi before we fly out \n I just had a few questions: 1. Firstly, I read that it’s the very end of the rainy season in Hoi A during early December. Do you think it’s still worth going and risking the rain, or would it be better to choose somewhere else? We want at least one relaxing beach time and also really wanted to see Hoi An. I also read it can be beautiful around Christmas. Is it worth it? Worried about being rained out the whole time but hoping if it’s at the end it might be okay. 2. Is Bai Tu Long bay as beautiful as Halong Bay? Worth it to book Bai Tu Long instead? 3. We’re planning on booking the EcoSapa limousine buses to/from Sapa and Hanoi. Are these a good choice?\n Any other recs/thoughts would be greatly appreciated (especially for a honeymoon vibe)!

As you guess it: Covid (2020) - Lockdown (2021) - Economic recession (2022-now). \n Me and my friends at around the same age have been seriously struggling to find decent jobs since the beginning of 2023. I thought I was lucky to find a job at a tech company with an \"ok\" salary (1000usd gross). Turned out the company is exploitative and management is extremely toxic and abusive. So back to the grind to find a job for the last couple of months. \n Why are companies trying to tell us Gen Zs as unstable and indecisive in our careers when in reality, we're (or most friends I know) just trying so hard to find a DECENT job where we can stick around for stability without being exploited to the point of mentally suffering to get by?\n Some recruiters even told me that my salary expectation was too high :) My expectation is 20-25M net/month?? Mind you, I have 4 years of experience, fluent at English and graduated from a top university in Aus. I know it largely depends on the job, industries... but it's affected my self-esteem somewhat. \n If you're a young native Vnese are you going through the same thing?\n If not, please teach me how to sniff out the bad companies and find ones that pay you you're worth?? Open to discuss further\n Edit: I live in HCM, the most expensive city in this country so my expected salary is just enough for me to pay rent, groceries, have very fundamental household needs fulfilled and left with around 2-3mil extra to save.

          "description": "I moved to Vietnam this year about six months ago. Almost right on cue, I started to have stomach problems, mainly in the form of diarrhea. Curiously, aside from two particularly awful days, it rarely manifests as outright food poisoning where it affects me the whole day. Rather I'll get \"you have 30 seconds to comply\" situations. Cafe sua especially has a tendency to cause this roughly 1/4 of the time, so I just avoid it now.\n If I cook at home or eat more expensive foreign cuisine like Korean or Japanese food, the problem alleviates and my bowels actually become normal. However, if I go out to eat Vietnamese food (even at busy restaurants with high turnover) or drink cafe coffee (including even some supposedly safe looking coffee shops like Cafe Amazon), it's only a matter of time before things rear their ugly head again. Most of the time, I'll be fine, but I feel like a bout or two of diarrhea (but not out and out food poisoning, I never throw up or feel nauseous) every two weeks isn't normal. It feels like a shame to not feel comfortable eating the local food due to these issues. \n I have never had these issues before, and the timing from my arrival here (as well as its alleviation when i switch to home cooking only) is quite conspicuous. From what I hear, travelers diarrhea is supposed to resolve within a few weeks, not six months. Has anyone else experienced these issues? Is my stomach just not built for here?\n    submitted by    /u/bacharama  \n [link]   [comments]",

The shop needs to fill up the customs declaration form. It will mention your passport details. Entry exit date, expiry date etc. You can claim the vat refund only if you are on a tourist visa, exiting the country. At the airport, you need to go to the customs office. At Hanoi airportz it's little tricky. The security, police don't understand English. I asked 4 people. They could not answer. Information desk could not explain me even after I showed the translator. Eventually I found out the customs office. \n I presented the customs declaration form to the officer. He took 2-3 minutes to verify it and forwarded to a clerk of MSB bank who was sitting at the next counter. She asked me to sign couple of forms. Then provided me 85% of the total vat. She paid me in cash USD. Entire process took 10 minutes. That's all.\n    submitted by    /u/here4geld  \n [link]   [comments]",

They sent an email for a physical interview that is set for this weekend, in the meanwhile they did this \"online prequalification\" that has to go through Telegram.\n The first part of this bullcrap is an MBTI test(?) that contains only like 5 questions. Am I that out of touched to the HR world that MBTI is a standard thing now?\n The second part is the relatively well-known scam that has been floating around recently, which is inputting data and get money from a lottery platform, all in the guys of \"making extra revenue\". First they sent me 150k to add to the platform, so I played along for a bit, got 330k in return. They seems to be impressed that they started telling me about the 4 tiers of data entry, which basically is an ever increasing amount of money in return for a (supposedly) even higher amount. Of course that first run was a trial period, the 2nd run will be a 40-60 shares of profit for the company. And on top of it, the lowest tier they put up is 600k, which is just above the amount that I just earned, which means I have to pour money out of my own pocket for them.\n Here's where I cut things off. This is too many red flags with screaming horns in my head. No fucking way a company would take money from their applicants. The funniest thing is that they even have the audacity to breath out that sentence I screenshotted above. I guess taking 330k from them is not much but it still filled my pettiness with something close to pride.\n So tl;dr: I have an encounter with a scam group that masquerading as a legit company. Took some money from them instead.\n    submitted by    /u/tacticalpepe420  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone! \n Im coming to Vietnam, to Ho Chi Minh 11th October, and I'm really confused. We have 11 days available and we returning to the same airport. My question is: What to do there? :) I had a lot of work before holiday and I couldn't prepare for this. Im starting now :) \n I was wondering about rental motorbike, but im not sure cause im going with my girlfriend and we have 2 big backpacks. What do you think guys?\n And im looking for something special, im not big fan of architecture, rather we prefer local experience and nature. I don't like the crowds too, but I know that's normal in big cities and popular attractions. \n ​\n In short - can you give us some hidden gems? And what do you think about rental 2 bikes ( My GF is driver too) and traveling from Ho Chi Minh to Hoi An. Or maybe we should take a plane and rent bikes there? And last but not least - weather. Im a little nervous when I see a forecast. \n    submitted by    /u/Infamous-Net-2163  \n [link]   [comments]",

Regardless the whole nation is called into question for some behavior.\n You guys do know that Vietnam is a country of over 100m population, with polarized income and living conditions, plus having worldwide diasporas (in North America, Australia, European continent, African continent, East Asia, the Middle East) so finding an average Nguyen is nigh impossible, right???\n Instead of asking “Why my Vietnamese relative treat me like shit?” or “Why Vietnamese male drink coffee all morning and doesn’t go to work?” People can rephrase it such as “why my relative treat me like shit?” - does the fact that they are Vietnamese or Vietnamese immigrants play any roles in the question?\n    submitted by    /u/Tiberiux  \n [link]   [comments]",

Initially, my father didn't want any part of me when my mother got pregnant because I was an accident. He impregnated my mom when he was 25, and she was 15. Before I was born, he tried to persuade my mom to have an abortion. I met him for the first time at the age of 5 and then reconnected with the family at the age of 12. My stepmom is mostly the reason why I wasn't around, as my father lied to her and never disclosed my existence until my mom basically gave him an ultimatum to accept me as his son. If he didn't, she would take him to court for child support, which she did, and he paid until I turned 18. My stepmom is also the reason I re-entered the family …",

Meanwhile he expects me to do a master’s degree and work full time as well. He teaches me things like: - It’s fine for men to have a high body count before marriage but girls should keep themselves pure - It’s a woman’s job to do the cooking, cleaning, etc. (including things like having to cut my husband’s finger and toe nails) - I shouldn’t do a doctor’s degree because men are deterred from women with higher education - It’s justified if my husband cheats if I don’t provide him with a warm meal and children\n My mother works full time as well but he feels entitled to everything she does for him. If there’s no food or the food is too salty for example, he starts to shout and says “without me, you would be living in the streets.”\n Is that normal for our Vietnamese culture? I’ve never seen him grateful for how we support him.\n    submitted by    /u/sienenntmichpapi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Eventually I went to the Wise website to see if something was locked with my card and I stumbled on a support page that listed countries that US accounts won’t work in. \n I have a card from my US bank so I’ll probably just take the fee on the chin or consider using the Western Union app to send myself some money in the morning.\n    submitted by    /u/Mlrk3y  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe in some countries you can get even fined if you occupy the left lane for no reason \n Do you believe a culture of left lane for passing only can be adopted here?

I love Vietnamese food (Banh Mi, soups and salads) and excited to try authentic fare as well as experience the culture. Some of my questions and concerns needing answers from travelers who have been there: -Visa. I believe visitors will need a visa to enter. Could anyone share the link to apply for the visa application? Can it be an online application, how much and how long to get the visa. -Money to get around. Are credit cards accepted or only cash? -Wifi access. Would getting a local SIM to access the internet be the best way? Do the Vietnamese telcos offer inexpensive prepaid SIMs and roughly how much? -Must sees and do's in Ho Chi Minh. Recommended places of interest to see and unique experiences would be great. -Souvenirs. What's good to bring home from Vietnam? I would appreciate your practical tips and suggestions.

On the surface, things sound pretty decent, especially since they offer a housing allowance. \n My pay according to the contract (before taxes) is 473,000 VND an hour (20 teaching hours a week), on top of a housing allowance of 7,000,000 VND per month. It's a standard 12-month contract. \n My main priorities are to learn how to be a good teacher, save as much as I can, and try to avoid stress as much as possible. That being said, I want to make sure ILA is a good fit for me. I don't mind the region I'm staying in (Can Tho) since I doubt I'm gonna leave my apartment much... for me, the priority is just learning a local culture and saving money. \n Does anyone have any experiences with ILA that they'd be willing to share? I understand that avoiding stress is impossible as a teacher, but I just want to make sure that they've got a good support system in place. The last thing I want is to be overworked or overwhelmed with stuff that they didn't mention in the interview or the contract... only to realize I could've had that same experience here, in the states. \n Long story shrot, this is the only offer I think I'll be getting from Vietnam... and I'm stuck between taking it and just giving up and sticking to living in the states. I don't want to go overseas and get burned out on teaching since I'm gonna be doing that for a living... \n Please let me know, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Uncanny_Hero  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I would like to hear your opinions about it today.\n I would like to start with my first experience with this issue. After I finished with my university, I got hired into a Vietnamese branch of a Japanese self-driving car start up. Things were fine back then except for one thing. My CEO. He was a total Japanese-supremacy guy (He is Vietnamese, btw). One day, me and my senior had to work overtime to fix some issues that the our Japanese colleagues made. It was a mismanagement problem, so while we were okay with working overtime to fix it, we thought it would be more productive to raise this problem in the next meeting…",

Nạn nhân ở đây là người phụ nữ Phan Thị Mỹ Hằng.\n Thoạt đầu tưởng rằng chỉ là trò bịp bợm của ai đó trên mạng nhưng hóa ra không phải. Khi thấy điểm bất ngờ nên tôi đã nghiên cứu qua thử thì thấy có rất nhiều điểm đáng để nói trong vụ án lần này.\n Trước khi tới tình tiết phân tích chuyên sâu, nếu ai đã đọc quyển sách Đêm trường tăm tối của Tử Kim Trần thì sẽ thấy sự giống y hệt xã hội chúng ta đang sống hiện tại.

I do not yet live in Vietnam, so when I search on my Dell from the USA, even if I search in Spanish (my second language), my results are highly skewed and unhelpful.\n If anyone has links, knows of good recruiting companies, or anything, I'd greatly appreciate it!

My grandma did not know of my brother because he was born out of wedlock. I accidentally let it slip. \n I’m contemplating doing a DNA test and potentially finding him. I want to do an American one as well since my grandpa (my dads father) was a lieutenant during the war. Though, I do want to meet my brother the most. To let him know my dad didn’t willingly abandon him. Have them meet. Help my grandma meet her first grandchild as she always thought I was the first. \n If anyone has any insight, that’ll be extremely helpful. Thank you.\n Edit: when I ask, “do people in Vietnam do these tests” it’s because I’m asking if it’s commonplace and if it’s as popular in other countries.

Are there mandatory checks somewhere? Are they somehow skippable?\n I understand that this is at all NOT recommended, but desperate times call for desperate means.

However, after a whole day of studying I felt drained? And I have a feeling that applying to college was a huge mistake or something. I'm think about withdrawing my college tuition fees if this keeps going on in the future.\n I applied to the Diplomatic Acedamy of Vietnam(DAV) by the way. Was it because I took a break for so long that I've grown accustomed to being lazy all day? Or was it something else? DAV is famous for having cut-throat competitive environment so maybe that's why? I felt totally intimidated by the environment. Maybe it was a huge mistake applying here. Deep down I have always had the desire to run away from society and become a hermit or a beggar so that I can get this mental turmoil off my head.\n I know some of you might think that I am being childish or immature but really, it got so bad that I quitted everything for a whole year and stayed at home doing nothing but house chores and walking around the neighborhood. Honestly I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me anymore. I am thinking of using my remaining savings to... run away somewhere before... committing suicide.\n    submitted by    /u/Efficient_Entry_5160  \n [link]   [comments]",

My mom got a \"heart situation\" and we called for an ambulance. On the way to the hospital the ER people said it was a myocardial infarction (heart attack). However, the doctorS (stress on plural cause multiple of them reviewed her case and i saw it) said they \"dont think\" that's the case. They suspect it to be a heart failure, \"maybe\" caused by either hypotension or hypoglycemia. Thats about everything they ever said during an entire week she was there.\n Well, here I am half a year later and still have no clue what actually happened to my mother and how i could prevent it from happening again. Cause they dont tell me or her or my dad. They just said dont worry rest well blah blah. They dont even give us the medical record, just a prescription paper in which it said thats the illness were \"related to coronary artery disease and other types of diabetes\".\n So why cant you tell us whats wrong with us? You cant or you're not allowed to? Is it a personal thing or a professional thing? Is it a public vs private hospital thing?

          "description": "Hello, so i am having my first solo travel in November.\n At the moment I scheduled 25 days in Vietnam. However from viewing different itineraries and youtube videos I was kina turned off by south Vietnam.\n My main priorities are breathtaking nature and sporty/extreme activities, like ziplines, surfing, diving.\n I don't care for big cities ,cultural tours, partying and craftsmentship workshops (which i heared there are a lot of in Hoi-an). Originally I was planning to go with my girlfriend, and these activities are fun as a couple, but I just don't think I will enjoy them as a solo traveler.\n I have read that north Vietnam's nature is amazing and compared to it South Vietnam is underwhelming and has more of the content that i am less inclined towards.\n Therefore I am considering the option of doing about 2 weeks in North Vietnam, focusing on the Loop, The caves, Sapa etc, and then transfering for a short diving/surfing vacation in the phillipins(which excites me but I was originally fine to give up to travel with my ex-gf) . I thought about Thailand as well but i had been there a few years ago. I might be able to add a few days to a week to my trip for that.\n I would love to hear about if someone thinks the plan is feasible / change my mind regarding south Vietnam/ present another option (Cambodia?)\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Small-Tip-8816  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I will be traveling to Vietnam in November and I will mostly stay in the North of Vietnam (Ha Giang, Sapa, Ha Long Bay, Ninh Binh) where the weather will be nice. I love outdoor stuff like hiking and trekking and therefore I would love to visit Phong Nha Ke Bang national park (it looks absolutely stunning!) and do an overnight trekking tour there. However, it seems that the national park is located in central Vietnam where November is part of the raining season. As a result Oxalis is not offering a lot of tours but I found another organization (Jungle Boss) that is offering several tours, even in caves. \n I’ve been trying to find out how bad it really is in November based on the experiences of other travelers and information on websites, but I’m getting lots of contradictory results. Is it a 100% chance of rain every day and should I be expecting rain all day long? Or should I expect some short (but intense) showers every day and is there also chance to see some sun? \n Also, when I look up temperatures most websites mention temperatures between 66°F (19°C) to 75°F (24°C), however, on other websites I read that it can get unbearably cold during the night. It’s very confusing as I would not describe 20 degrees Celsius as unbearably cold. \n I know it would be best to come back to Vietnam for the central part another time, but I don’t think I’ll be back in Vietnam soon as there are so many other places on my travel bucket list as well. And I also know that the weather can’t be predicted but it would be great to hear at least some real experiences from other travelers in November. Not just in Ke Bang national park but experiences from central Vietnam in general will be appreciated.\n (My native language is not English, sorry for any misspelling)\n    submitted by    /u/Atelerixis  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nobody would ask me to eat my snacks/dinners/etc. This never bugged me but it did always cross my mind when I would go to take my food home and there was no food left! It now appears to me, having been to a recent work banquet, where my co-workers grabbed several smaller bowls and placed different variations of their pho and egg noodles for me to taste. And it doesn't stop there, they always offer me to try new things. From desserts with potato to different variations of noodles.

When you go to Hue, you can see the ancient Hue Imperial City and the famous Temple. You can walk by the river during the day and go to nearby bars to drink and listen to songs at night. It is a very pleasant life.\n The day and night in Hoi An Ancient Town are particularly attractive. Walk around the ancient town during the day, go to a nearby coffee shop for a cup of coffee and some cake. You can also go to the riverside at night, and both sides are very beautiful! There are many famous restaurants nearby! My favorite coffee shop is Mia Coffee. Their cakes are very delicious and the coffee is also great. It should be reminded that Hoi An's consumption is higher than that of Hue and even in Da nang, which may be due to tourist cities! What you get with the same money is not worth it! But this is the reason why it is a tourist city. It should be noted that there are some stores that do not indicate the price, and the boss may overpay tourists!\n I mainly went to Monkey Mountain and the Pink Church in Da nang, as well as the Cham Sculpture Museum. If you are interested in Cham culture, you can go and have a look! Very good! You can also go to the holy places of Meishan, which are some historical relics of Hinduism. The night in Da nang is beautiful! There are many lively bars where you can go for a drink. However, I ended up spending time at the Hilton Hotel in Da nang. During the day, I also went to the beach for a drink, ate some snacks, and lay on the beach chair to read. It was very comfortably. The executive lounge of the Hilton Hotel is also very good!

          "description": "Disclaimer: I genuinely love kids. I don't mean to offend anyone by judging the children, but I'd like to hear your opinion.\n I usually visit certain coffee shops on the weekends to find new inspiration and refresh my mind. I tend to be more creative in such places. Lately, I've been frequenting The Coffee House due to its spacious and comfortable ambiance for working. However, I've encountered some issues with families that bring their children, typically around 3 to 5 years old. These kids never sit still, always yelling and running around without much supervision from their parents. Moreover, the parents in these families tend to speak loudly, trying to overcome the noise created by their children, and sometimes they reprimand their children when they glance at the kids attempting to break something. This results in a significant amount of chaos, which can be quite anxious. It feels more like a kindergarten than a place for adults.\n I want to emphasize once again that I'm not passing judgment on the children or their parents. However, from my perspective, it appears that the awareness of some individuals nowadays is somewhat lacking, and this could potentially have a negative impact on their children's behavior and attitudes (It is actually occurring now)\n Peace.\n    submitted by    /u/Namtrungksxd  \n [link]   [comments]",

But instead of going the traditional route of marrying heterosexual, or partnering with a lesbian couple, I wanna do the better thing of adopting a child. \n Heck, even if I'm heterosexual I would still choose to adopt a child. There's a lot of children needing a home, if you want a child just adopt them, why create for yourself the trouble of having to deal with weddings, the wife's family side and stuff. Beside, you have the time to connect to a kid before deciding you could bond with it or not\n But my mother, told me that I'm crazy and a non blood-related child could never be loyal to me, and always leave me in the end. I told her that I want to father a child not to have someone to take care of me, but to have the feeling that If I were to pass away, I have done something right with my life. I don't know how to explain this, but it's like I will live my whole life accumulating money, knowledge and experiences, and it would feel like it'll be all for nothing if I won't spend all of those things on helping and nurturing someone else.

          "description": "Me and my gf are at the same age, around 23. She graduated college, i'm still studying for 2 more years, she wanted to start a family at least by the age of 25. I know i'm not good enough to take responsible for such a huge commitment ( i'm not grown up enough ), not at least until i can provide for myself. We had a lot of arguments that i should accept the fact that she might leave me as she wants the best thing for her. Since then, she changed, the way she loved, the way she talked, everything must be exactly what she wants so she can trust that i'm good enough to be the one for her. Not until a lot of pressures i've been through recently, even when she is one of the biggest pressure feel, now i cant take it anymore, just want to kill myself sometimes. Not even mentioned of the things she wanted me to become when she won't accept me for who i am. I cried so much i start losing sleep, losing hairs,... However, she still cares for me, make me feel comfortable and she points out the best in me.\n What should i do when breaking up with my gf is the best thing for both of us but we love each other so much, i know it, i'm just too selfish to admit that to let her go...\n    submitted by    /u/AlexZx29  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I only got to spend a week there, and I did a lot of typical tourist activities. I'm American, but I actually went on vacation visiting from China back in 2019. I had been living in Beijing for a year. Beijing is a tier 1 Chinese city, but the vibe is... depressing. People generally look unhappy and stoic, similar to Soviet style culture I suppose. Chinese are inoffensive in customer service, but just... cold. When I landed in Hanoi, which is supposedly the conservative part of Vietnam, the difference was night and day. Interactions with hotel workers, restaurant workers etc was warm and welcoming. English was spoken widely, which again is total opposite of Beijing. What struck me the most was the energy. You could \"feel\" the progress in the air, like it was an up place where the best is yet to come. I heard China had a similar vibe in the early 2000s. Contrast with China now tho, which by 2019 had already apexed and was showing clear signs of decline. I stayed at a Hilton in the center of Hanoi and it was buzzing with business travelers. Clearly it's a growing hub of activity. I also did a junk boat trip in ha long bay, and the guy on the boat was talking about how better life has gotten in just the last 5 years. From the warm locals, to the food (tho I'll be honest Hanoi food wasn't that great, but the street food was fun and cheap... heard HCM is the place to go for food), the vibe in the air, Vietnam stole my heart and I can't wait to return. I've been to well over a dozen countries and lived in 4 continents. I would absolutely love to spend a year or two in Vietnam as it rapidly transforms and grows it's presence on the global stage. I wish you all success, I know life isn't easy for all, but as someone who's \"been around the block\", Vietnam is special.

I quit my marketing job back home and wanted a break to travel, so I booked flights to Vietnam to be here for roughly a month. I arrived in Hanoi on the 6th of this month, and I'm still here.\n I'm enjoying your country. I'm considering to stay, if it is possible.\n Is it?\n I would want/need to get a job. My talent is marketing (specifically English/Dutch content and SEO), and I speak English fluently, my accent however is bad.\n Besides that, I would of course need the needed documentation, like a work visa.

This time though I am with my girlfriend and so would maybe be interested in using a bike, sometimes, instead of taking separate trips or cars. \n When in HCMC, we have walking distance all we need, and I would not want to use a bike here anyway. \n But in a place like Da Lat, or maybe Đà Nẵng, or Huế, I wonder if all things considered it would be a good idea. \n  \nI do not want any problems with the police, so I am wondering worst case scenario what is the biggest issue we could have, a fine? Or worse? How likely is a stop anyway, I have been in Asia a lot and always see foreigners riding bikes, some with helmets (as we would) and some without (foolish) and never seen anyone have an issue. But I have heard online of issues. \n How safe would it even be? I will avoid one hundred percent HCMC/Hanoi, but in quieter places will it be better?\n Realistically how hard is it to drive the bikes? I have ridden quads before, and also bicycles (I’d that’s relevant) \n  \nIt’s just likely that renting a bike in places like da làt to go see some more far away places would be ideal and cost effective. \n If it is not a good idea though, we will just have to figure out another plan.\n    submitted by    /u/Ambitious-Ad1884  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been a completed troll. I've enforced punishments, like making them stand for the duration of the lesson (now we have been told we are not to punish in anyway as learning English is just an 'extra' class, not important).\n I've explained that their behavior is unacceptable, and when someone is speaking you listen. Especially a teacher. Right after explaining they turn right around to the person behind them, and start talking or playing Uno.\n Then there is the fighting in class. Last week two boys had a full on punch up in the classroom over who got the answer right. \n The other day I walked into a classroom, and a boy looked at me and said 'what the fuck is this?' \n It's a fight from beginning to end.

What would be a good way to find a local guide who can dedicate 2-4 weeks to showing me around the entire country? \n I feel this would be a good opportunity for a recent grad who wants to practice English (with someone who is fluent in both English and Vietnamese) and to go on a free vacation (with modest base pay ~$500USD for one month and basic essentials like food, lodging, etc.) covered. I would also prefer it if they are a woman (because I am female and would feel more comfortable with another woman) who knows how to drive a car/motorbike and who has experience traveling in VN. Am I being unreasonable/ too demanding?\n If it isn't clear, I am asking here because I feel most of the options I see are group tours geared towards tourists who have 0 understanding of Vietnamese language and culture and rely purely on English-speaking guides and tours.

It would be something for 2-3 years from now, so I can increase my income potential to be able to have the capital to be a foreign investor.\n    submitted by    /u/AnIrishPagan  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been in the massive cities in Europe and I’m ready for a slower pace for a while.\n I speak absolutely no Vietnamese. I have no qualms about using google translate, but I want to visit a place where that wouldn’t be viewed as a negative thing. In other words, someplace tourist friendly, even if it isn’t touristy.\n I tend to love seeing museums and historical sites when I travel, so someplace where at least some of that is available.\n I’m not a digital nomad, but decent internet so I can keep in touch with family and friends would be nice.\n Near a beach, even for day trips would be cool, but in no way a requirement.\n  \nAny suggestions?

I’ve got a few ideas but I’m wondering what other people would think of too. Thanks for all the help :))\n    submitted by    /u/Otherwise-Olive-7463  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I'm currently exploring the possibility of manufacturing silicone/tpe based products, and I was wondering if any of you might have some insights or recommendations. I want to emphasize that I'm looking for legitimate manufacturers.\n Here are some specific details about what I'm looking for:\n  \nTooling: We plan to supply our own tooling, so manufacturers who can work with provided molds and specifications would be ideal. However, we're also open to exploring the costs of having tooling made in Vietnam if it makes economic sense.\n Manufacturing Location: While we're open to manufacturers outside Vietnam, we're particularly interested in understanding the manufacturing landscape within Vietnam itself. If you have knowledge about manufacturers in Vietnam or can recommend any reputable companies, please share your insights.\n Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Our initial requirement is a minimum order quantity of 400 units. If you know of manufacturers that can accommodate this quantity or provide competitive pricing at this scale, we'd greatly appreciate your suggestions.\n Packaging: We plan to handle the packaging ourselves, so manufacturers who can provide the product without packaging would be preferred.\n  \nPlease keep in mind that this inquiry is for legitimate purposes, and I'm looking for advice on how to approach this inquiry in a responsible manner.\n Feel free to reply here or send me a private message if you prefer to share information privately. I can also explicitly share images of our products as well. I will also be asking you to provide examples of your work.\n Thank you in advance!\n Best.\n    submitted by    /u/shayeyetuh  \n [link]   [comments]",

First I went to see family in HCM, then I began my solo journey to Hoi An and Da Nang. No issues in either place. but I’ve been in Hanoi since Saturday and walking around I’m noticing a lot of harassment from south Asian tourists . Yesterday I was in Ha Long Bay at the beach and this guy started taking photos of me. Then he came up to me and asked if he could take photos with me, I said no. Another tourist came banging on my hotel door last night on the cruise which scared the crap out of me. I told him to go away. Today I’m back in Hanoi just walking around in the old quarter and a group of them started to stare at me like I was prey. I quickly grabbed my dinner and went back to my hotel.\n I have no issues with south Asians, I have a lot of South Asian friends in the states and also work with them. They are the kindest people. They do not act like this. I just never experienced harassment from like this and it’s kind of bummer it’s happening IN Vietnam.

I went back to vietnam about a week ago to attend my cousins weddings and have had so much fun. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m on vacation but I’ve seen Vietnamese people way more relax and not uptight like Americans. Breakfast and cafe in the morning will thousands of options, my cousin here in Vietnam is a freelance video editor and he works whenever and wherever he wants, around noon all the vendors close for a nap time, and at night eat out (again with thousands of options).\n Meanwhile, I work 9-5 in the states with 30mins lunch time but sometimes I eat at my desk. After work, I have to go to the grocery stores or the gym and sometimes too tired to even cook. Weekends I have to do chores and again grocery. It just feels like time is shorter in the states.\n Everything is getting more expensive in the states so my 75k a year salary doesn’t seem much. My fiancé is a teacher so her job is pretty demanding too. \n I just feel like people in Vietnam just have more what we call ‘freedom’ the U.S has been advertising. I’ve been considering moving back to vietnam for the past few days if I can work remote and my fiancé can teach English but my parents have properties in the states and they have sacrificed so much so I can have the “best” life in America…just some thoughts\n Edit: just to clarify since some people are triggered because I use the word “freedom” what I meant is it just seem that the lifestyle and work style in Vietnam is more relax compared to America but I do understand that I’m here on vacation so people take off work to hang with me\n    submitted by    /u/ChillZilla2077  \n [link]   [comments]",

He said that discounted rides means he gets paid less.\n So, how do payments work for discounted rides?

          "description": "So! It's officially been one month since I moved to Vietnam from America. So far, I'm really liking the country- even though I know I have plenty of room to grow and get to know it better. Given this, I wanted to ask some more trivial questions and provide some general comments as an adjusting newcomer.\n  \nAre measuring cups in cooking not a thing here? None of the stores I've found that have kitchen appliances carry them- even the more specialized ones at Aeon Mall.\n Having witnessed the car-clogged streets of Manhattan, I find the constant flow of motorbikes pretty refreshing (even if I'm terrified to ride one in Ho Chi Minh City).\n I've visited a few Buddhist temples and seen some shrines around, and they often have food in them like apples, kumquats, etc. Is this food for anyone, or does it serve a specific purpose? I don't want to take when I'm not supposed to. EDIT: Answered! I will not take that food.\n I'm still bemused by how frequently I see Lotso Bear. He seems to be pretty popular independent of Toy Story, and I'm not quite sure why.\n I hear that avoiding eye contact is generally used when Vietnamese people are frustrated, since they want to avoid direct confrontation. I've always struggled with eye contact (I'm on the autism spectrum), so would Vietnamese people read that as a sign of anger or hostility?\n  \nGod knows, I have plenty more thoughts, but I've worked through a lot of those with some of my friends.

Cụ thể là tiền thuê nhà, chi phí sinh hoạt, ăn uống hàng ngày mình đều lo cho ảnh mỗi ngày kể từ khi yêu nhau. Ảnh thì đi xin việc ở đâu cũng bị từ chối do có hình xăm nên tính ra từ khi mới yêu ảnh mới đi làm khoảng 3 tháng (không liền nhau). Thời gian còn lại lúc nào cũng kè kè bên mình. Mình luôn động viên ảnh và chỉ yêu cầu ảnh hỗ trợ mình làm 1 vài việc chân tay. Ảnh có cơ thể khá yếu nên hay kêu mệt mỏi với mình, nhiều lúc ốm mình cũng đưa ảnh đi viện để truyền và mua thuốc cho ảnh. Thật sự với mình như vậy là mình quá cảm thông cho ảnh rồi. Nhưng cho đến hôm trước mình như tức nước vỡ bờ. Ảnh mới kiếm được 1 công việc phục vụ 5 tiếng 1 ngày thì tối ảnh tan ca qua đón mình. Đó là ngày thứ 3 anh đi làm. Như mọi hôm mình đưa anh qua cửa hàng tiện lợi mua mì và nước cho ảnh hồi sức. Sau đó bọn mình có chơi game 1 lúc rồi lại về nhà mình ăn cơm và xem phim, sau đó mình cũng gọi nước sinh tố về cho anh bồi bổ. Ăn xong mình chỉ nhờ ảnh rửa bát, lúc mình bảo thì ảnh không nói gì với mình mà cứ lẳng lặng đi làm. Nhưng lúc rửa bát thì ảnh bắt đầu khó chịu với mình và nói mình không biết thông cảm cho anh đi làm cả ngày mệt và tụi mình cãi nhau. Ảnh nói từ nay ảnh không qua ăn cơm là được nhưng suốt 1 năm qua ngày nào ảnh cũng qua ăn. Mình biết tiền không phải thước đo nhưng để làm ra tiền thì mình cũng phải mất công sức và trí tuệ nên với mình đó là tấm lòng của mình. Như vậy là mình chưa thông cảm cho ảnh phải không?\n    submitted by    /u/Harleyjudyzuto  \n [link]   [comments]",

But they kept teasing me about this one word that they refuse to tell me for months, no matter how much I begged.\n They told me it’s so bad they will never teach it to me. It’s apparently a really old slang and you need to be local local to know, hard to find on Google as well, It’s just as bad if not worse than N-word with hard r. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY’RE REFERRING TO?\n Update: It's an old slang for natives, it's used for females specifically. \"Lẹo cái\" seems to be the closest one but it's not complete. It's a banned word on google, my friend's only seen one text that had it written but it's been banned since.

But in the song there was like 3 guy(don’t know if they were brothers or friends) but they were flirting with this one girl. I guess it’s kind of like a love song but more gear towards a younger audience. I remember in the music video the artist rode a bike 😂. Finally the 3 guys made a lot of songs together. Don’t know if they were individual artist working together or they were an actual music group that only made music together.

I heard that most people use \"Mày\", and \"Tao\" to refer to their friends and themselves to their friends, as it's an sign of being intimate and close and comfortable enough with them\n I personally don't like those two pronouns and don't use them much often, I think it could come out quite harsh some times, there's a reason most people don't use it with strangers. But there're people in the North assume it's the default way to call people no matter how close or distant you are, and I hate them so much, it sounds so rude if you and I aren't that close\n With my best friends and friends, I use their personal names/tôi or tao if extremely close. Ông/Tôi and Personal names/Personal names. \n The rare cases I use \"Mày\" and \"Tao\" with my friends are when I'm trying to make a comedy skit or purpousfully acting theatrically with them.\n    submitted by    /u/KeyAndy  \n [link]   [comments]",

A Vietnamese guy introduced these songs to me ☺️\n There’re many reasons I want to explore Vietnam. Youth is too short to settle down.😎\n I know there is a big difference between north and south parts. My friend says HCM’s vibe is similar to Bangkok, so I choose Hanoi. I want something different. My friend will be in Hanoi soon, so he may help me a lot. And I have at least one person to hang out with\n My main concern is job hunting in Vietnam.

I studied abroad here and got a full time job, so I have work experience\n I have a degree in graphics design and diploma in photography. \n How’s graphics design and photography industries in Vietnam? Any chance for me to get a job at a big studios or simply work as freelancer. I want to work for a professional one. I may send portfolio to potential employers.\n My other option is teaching. I took IELTS exam 2 months ago. My overall band is 7.5. Not bad, but not good enough to be English teacher.\n I have c2 in French and have lived in French speaking environment for a long time. I am thai, but my ancestors are Chinese and British, and I can speak some mandarin. I am thinking about being a French or Thai teacher.\n Do many local people want to learn French or Thai?\n Any suggestions to adapt environment in positive way, job hunting, housing and socializing?\n How do vietnamese think about Thai in general, esp female?

          "description": "I've been wondering about this for a while now...it's late 2023, covid will never be totally gone but much of the world has gotten vaccinated and moved on as the severity of the virus has decreased. \n I don't see too many folks on the streets masking these days, but for some reason it seems really common in high schools - I teach IELTS in high schools in Hanoi, and am surprised that sometimes up to half of my students are still masking. I wonder what the reason is - are they really doing it for health protocol? I can't imagine teenagers are particularly worried about getting sick at this point right? Do their parents make them? My theory is that a lot of young people wear them because it helps self-conscious teens feel \"covered\" and secured a little bit. \n I'm not an anti-masker, these guys can do what they want - just curious why it seems so much more prevalent than in other countries (to be clear, I'm talking about students in a classroom wearing it year-long, not wearing it on the road or because they're sick.)\n    submitted by    /u/bobokeen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nhưng đáp lại sự tôn trọng cuối cùng đó cô ta lại lấy tôi ra để làm trò tiêu khiển bên tên khốn kia. Rồi sau vài lần nói chuyện không thể kết thúc tôi đã gửi những bằng chứng về việc bố H ngoại tình cho mẹ H và mẹ cô ta làm ầm lên rồi li hôn. Chưa cảm thấy thỏa mãn, tôi lại khiến bố cô ta bị bắt vì tội tổ chức đánh bạc và phải ngồi tù 4 năm. Sau 1 năm chia tay, tôi nghe được tin từ vài người bạn chung của 2 đứa về việc cuộc sống cô ta khá tồi tệ khi mà bố đang phải thụ án, mẹ nuôi 2 đứa em và cô ta thì cũng khá tệ. Tôi đã không cảm thấy bất kì điều gì khi tôi nghe những điều đó. \n Đây là câu chuyện thật của bản thân mình nhưng chỉ là vắn tắt, nếu mọi người muốn nghe đầy đủ \"từ tình yêu ngọt ngào đến sự trả thù không hề thương xót\" hãy cmt cho mình biết.\n    submitted by    /u/Lucifer25002  \n [link]   [comments]",

The first task is about 4 pie charts, which took me 25 minutes to finish. The second one is “Some people think that good health is very important to every person, so medical service should not be run by profit-making companies. Do the advantages of private health care outweigh the disadvantages?” I was stunned after reading it, but I still tried my best to complete the essay. When it was done, I counted the words and found out that I wrote just only 200 words, while the task requires to write at least 250 words. But I didn’t have time to add more or look over it, I had to handle it because time was up. I feel really bad now.

They will be working remote every day but will need to give some live presentations so a strong reliable wifi signal is important. \n On the flip side, I wanted to recommend a place where they could also walk to local places for food. Originally I wanted to recommend Hoi An for the experience, but I wouldn't trust the wifi enough (at least not at the bandwidth they'd need). Maybe Da Nang but the hotels that I'd assume would have the best wifi are not near areas that are very walkable and are very touristy. They could visit Hoi An for a half day trip though. Then I was thinking Nha Trang - I remember staying near the water in a modern hotel and could walk down narrow streets to some hidden gems though it was pretty touristy. That was pre-pandemic, maybe they got pushed out...not sure.\n Open to other suggestions (and I'll probably add them to my own itinerary next trip)!\n    submitted by    /u/Biking_dude  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The entire reason why he lived the way he did was because he wanted to be humble and plain. He dressed, ate, and lived like an average farmer, he treated everyone as an equal and he also wanted to be treated as an equal by us as well. So why are we treating him like he's the God Emperor from 40k. For example, we preserve his corpse in something that is almost like a temple. And yet teachers, parents and practically everyone that i talk to compares him to a god. I'm not hating on him, I appreciate his efforts in freeing this country. But I'm confused on why we are treating in the exact opposite way that he wanted to be treated.\n    submitted by    /u/Unavailable-NO1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "American here.\n When visiting to my local barnes and noble recently it was obvious from first glance that a lot of media from Asia is popular. My bookstore shelves are stocked to the brim with Japanese, Korean, even Chinese comics and light novels, figurines, the works. Korean and Japanese pop stars fill the music section, easily holding their own against big western pop stars like Gaga and Bieber.\n But aside from some novels in the young adult section of my bookstore written by Vietnamese Americans, or the usual biographies in the history section discussing the war. There's not a lot of pop culture made by Vietnamese that's popular in the western market as other asian countries. Not a lot of fantasy or horror novels, not a lot of manga, not even the odd pop star. \n You'd think with how much has changed in US-Vietnam relations since the war we'd be seeing more Vietnamese pop culture get exported over here. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Why is that?\n And it's not like Americans are biased against Vietnamese culture because of the war or years of action movies. Far from it. Vietnamese Food is very popular in places like Los Angeles and Toronto, but vietnamese pop culture seems to have fallen completely by the wayside.\n So I'm here to ask for theories on why Vietnamese media isn't as big of a thing in the west as the other nations cultures. And also to ask for recommendations on vietnamese books, movies, tv, manga etc. that I might be interested in?\n    submitted by    /u/Sivilian888010  \n [link]   [comments]",
