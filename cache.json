We want to fit in Ha Giang/Sapa, Ninh Binh, Halong Bay, and Hanoi in but the issue is 10 days is a little tight.\n What do you guys think about the 4 day/3 night option vs 3 day/2 nights for Ha Giang Loop? Is it too rushed to do the 3 day option on QT's website? It allows us to fit Ninh Binh and Halong Bay in a bit easier but I'm a little worried that it'll be too rushed to enjoy the loop.\n The other option is to do Sapa instead of the Ha Giang loop which will definitely make the itinerary easier since I think you can definitely fit Sapa in 3 day/2 nights in very easily.\n Thoughts? Are there any other places you think I should consider and bump one of the options I listed out?\n    submitted by    /u/IevaFT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are staying in Hồ Tràm for holidays, in a big tourist resort. On a Christmas eve Turkey dinner, there was a big group of people, who were (almost)all wearing white fancy clothes: most of them young and adult ladies but some men, children and at least one old lady. They were almost all wearing white fancy clothes: dresses, lacy shirts etc. Except the old woman was wearing something red & some men had jeans or black trousers. They were also playing some games or giving speeches or something.\n In my culture white fancy clothes are usually something a bridal party wears, or on some other special occasion if everyone is wearing them in unison. I was wondering if this is a cultural thing for a special occasion, as they all looked more Asian than Caucasian, and asked our waiter, what was the occasion end gestured in their general direction (I think I did it discreetly) and our waiter was immediately super apologetic and kept repeating \"I'm so sorry\" and we were super confused, saying \"no need to apologize, it's fine\" etc. and we never got an answer, what was the occasion, and we were left in confusion.\n My SO was giving me shit afterwards for asking it. I never intended it to be anything hurtful or insulting, as they were in high spirits and I think it is okay in many cultures to ask simply \"what's the occasion\" when you see a group or family celebrating. \n So if someone could guess what was the occasion and also tell me if I was an insensitive white biach.\n    submitted by    /u/hipunen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "You may be surprised to know Vietnam has a wonderful cosplay community. There are several groups that organize events year round (usually 1-2 events every month). Currently, there is a Winter Convention Manga Festival going on; it was today and it will also be going on tomorrow too! \n If you are into anime, manga, comics, and cosplay, then you should absolutely check these events out. I have been going to every event for the last 5 months or so. I film short videos (3-5 minutes) showing the cosplayers. I let them do a pose/action for about 5 seconds and show as many as I can. \n You can find the cosplay festival videos by searching YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I have a \"Cosplay!\" playlist from all the events. If you see me there, I am always happy to include you in my videos if you want to be in one. I do it to showcase the cosplay community and let others know about this community in Vietnam. All the people who go are very kind and friendly. Those of us that dress up always allow people to take photos and videos. \n Entry fees for most of the events is around 120,000 VND. Hope to see more new cosplayers in the near future. If you have any questions, just let me know!\n    submitted by    /u/SaigonSterling  \n [link]   [comments]",

The country is beautiful, the food and culture are amazing, and I’ve found the people to be the best part of all - extremely gracious, respectful, and hospitable.\n But then I came to Hanoi. And I’m baffled. We had a bus driver sneezing and coughing up phlegm, spitting it into a cup, for the entirety of a three hour bus ride, there and back, without a mask. This morning, we were in a lovely coffee shop. But the girl sitting across from us, working on her laptop, was sneezing uncontrollably and coughing terribly. She was clearly not just under the weather, but very sick. Again, she was not wearing a mask. I made eye contact with a perplexed look on my face and she looked back as though I was the one in the wrong. \n And then a cab just now. The driver coughing every 10 seconds for a 20 minute ride. No mask. \n I know people here wear masks. More than half of the people on motorbikes have them on. What are they for? Do people in Hanoi use them just for pollution? When we were in other cities (Saigon, Hoi An, Ninh Binh, Mai Chau) I saw plenty of people wearing masks inside, and none of the kind of blantant illness that is in Hanoi.\n I’m terribly sorry if this comes off as culturally insensitive. I promise I don’t intend it to be. But coming from the West and other parts of Vietnam, and particularly in a post-Covid world, I’m really perplexed - what is going on in Hanoi?\n    submitted by    /u/goaliebloak  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's a QR code, but it wouldn't scan for me. At the very bottom of the bill it mentions \"Payoo\" which appears to be a payment app. Would anybody be so kind as to look at this bill and decipher for me how to pay it? I have Venmo and PayPal.

I really see living in Vietnam as a lifetime experience for the whole family but I must admit we are getting tired with Saigon, in particular:\n - air pollution\n - noise\n Things we do like here:\n - green area in D7\n - great English run preschool\n - good eating and services availability \n As I can work remotely, coming to office not very frequently, moving somewhere else is an option. I need to fly to SEA countries occasionally, trips to China and Japan can happen too. English preschool is important as our kid is just learning English :)\n Danang looks good for those reasons:\n - no air pollution\n - access to beach, proximity to other nature attractions\n - less busy, less traffic\n We have been only once, actually going to Hoi An. I would plan going there for a month or so, closed to end of lease of our apartment in HCMC.\n ​\n To the point. I am curious of opinions/experiences of other people that have done this move, or have been considering it and dropped the idea (why).

If I send $100 USD and it converts to about 2,300,000. \n For Vietnamese people does this translate to about 2,300 dollars? \n That's like here in the US, someone depositing $2,300 into my bank and having enough to buy a older used car. I would think it is equivalent to $230 dollars for you and something that can hold you off for a short amount of time spending-wise, otherwise shouldn't 2,300 lasts a much long time? \n It seems as though the family in Vietnam spends the money pretty quickly or need to ask for asistance often. So another question would be: Is the cost of living in VN pretty high for locals? I know for us Viet Kieu it's very livable and considered cheap but im hearing a family member said his daughter ate a bowl of Pho for 50,000 and one time 90,000VND. If Vietnam money starts at 1,000 and that is like $1 dollar here in US, that's like me going out to buy a bowl of Pho for $50 - 100 usd which is unheard of. \n So I've been looking for answers on google about this but have not found a clear answer so I am hoping you all can shed some light on this. \n thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Latter-Project536  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am currently in the process of applying for a job in Vietnam. I've been offered a position in Ho Chi Minh City with VUS. I see reviews on glassdoor are generally good, but that's the average of all reviews, and things could clearly have changed post-pandemic, so that's why I'm here asking. I've done teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, and the experience I had with them was very different from how VUS is doing things so far with me. To be honest, it comes off as sketchy at times and makes me suspicious.\n I'll be honest, I'm actually quite confused at points. I was offered a job, but when asked to see an actual written contract with terms, conditions, duties, etc., I was told that I would only see a contract after I've landed in Vietnam. Agreeing to take a job on the other side of the world without having seen and signed an actual contract beforehand strikes me as super sketchy. When I took teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, they provided me with full-on, multi-page contracts to read and review before agreeing to fly halfway around the world.\n I also know that I'll be flown in on a business visa and do a probation period first for a month or two before acquiring a work permit and then a resident permit from there. Once again, this also confuses me. I've never had to do a probation period before when agreeing to do a job overseas, and the whole \"applying for a 3-month business visa, then a work permit\" thing instead of \"applying for a work visa from the get-go\" thing also confuses me.\n Lastly, aside from all that, how has your experience been with VUS? How was the teaching and prep workload? How were employer-employee relations overall? Was the pay sufficient to save (aiming for $500 a month if I can) and could hours be picked up easily? If on a part-time contract, was it easy to take vacation days (even if unpaid)? \n Any and all input is welcome. Thank you very much in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/bacharama  \n [link]   [comments]",

All the advice we read beforehand was about metered taxis, and the guy said that the taxi is metered so we didn’t think anything more of it so it should be fine. Hopped in and asked to be dropped to our hotel in District 1. \n No joke… the meter was going up 25k every 10 seconds. After less than 10 mins of driving, we told him it’s far too expensive and we need to get out. Paid 600k to be left on the side of the road :( wish we’d stuck to our guns and given him less, he made a stupid amount off our naïveté. \n We ordered a Grab which dropped us the rest of the way for just 80k. In hindsight that’s what we should’ve done when we were looking for a taxi, but hindsight is always 20/20!\n    submitted by    /u/sam0sa94  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’d love to have a scientific job there such as medical research, but I’ve done quite a bit of looking into this and can’t seem to find many opportunities, so I would probably go into teaching english.\n I lived in Saigon for about 6 months in 2020 with my now ex-gf, and I really loved it, and ever since have been a little obsessed with watching videos about it, keeping up with news/info there. My friends and family know I love it as I do speak about it with them sometimes.\n The problem is, while I was living there, I wasn’t actually working, so it was more of an extended holiday, and I know actually working there would be much different. I have a TEFL certificate and also a bachelors degree, and actually had an interview a while ago when I was considering moving there a year ago, and was offered a teaching job, but in the end I declined it.\n Only things that are stopping me are leaving my great friends and family here, learning to ride a bike there is a bit daunting (never driven one before), and maybe regretting my decision after taking the leap. \n I am considering taking another holiday there for around a month and just kind of acting like I l live and work there, just to test it out, but not sure how useful that actually is.\n Anyway, if you have any thoughts on this let me know! And if you know of any medical science jobs there that a British person with a science degree could get into, please tell me (although I may make a separate post about this)!\n    submitted by    /u/ijintheuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Several days ago, I have read two articles that are critical about Vinfast.\n VinFast VF8 Is Simply Not Ready for America (jalopnik.com) \n 180 Miles for $55k: Can the 2023 VinFast VF 8 SUV Break Into America? (motortrend.com) \n From what I have found out, the Vinfast VF 8 would cost at least $55k (Eco starts at $59k according to their site), and that the City Edition would only have 180 miles of range, which is a joke considering that most EVs have between 200-350 miles of range. The fact that the Vinfast name is weak compared to other brands like Tesla, Polestar, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, Ford, GM, Mercedes Benz, BMW, VW/Audi/Porsche, etc. won't do it any favours either.\n In the US, with other EVs that are more competitive like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Hyundai Kona EV, Kia EV6, Kia Niro EV, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Polestar 2, BMW i4, Mercedes Benz EQB, Audi Q4 E-tron, VW ID.4, Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and the Tesla Model 3 (even its starting price now at $47k puts it at a better position than the VF 8, and that is after massive price hikes as the April 2021 price of the Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive sits below $40k), would Vinfast succeed or would they end up failing like Yugo (at least Yugos are cheap)?\n Also, how was the experience of Vinfast cars and EVs in Vietnam? Were they good or were they bad?\n    submitted by    /u/MussleGeeYem  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to be independent and not have to rely on others for me to legally stay in vietnam. \n I do have some family members in Sagion/Bao Loc but I am not very close to them. I can also speak basic vietnamese, as in I can navigate daily life but when it comes to reading gov't documents and speaking on important matters I am not at that level yet.

I am not installing solar panels, just batteries that are charged by electricity when available. \"Pin tích điện\" is the Vietnamese keyword I can use without being pointed to \"ắc quy\" or \"pin sạc\" (which won't have enough wattage). Can you please recommend a good source? What is the general price for my requirements below? In the long run is it cheaper than a generator? Is there a reason most people just use generators that I am not aware of?\n We won't be cooking but an aircon is required for at least 3-4 hours for our toddler (also one reason I prefer battery over generator is due to the noise). I would like to run a fan, watch TV or use my laptop if possible. There is a fridge, would be nice if I can keep it running but we always keep it cold the day before anyway so maybe running it for an hour only mid-day won't hurt.\n    submitted by    /u/datvm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've read a lot about people who've jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge (one of the world's most frequent suicide locations) and one quote has stuck with me:\n Ken Baldwin jumped from the bridge many years ago, in 1985 (a two-hundred-foot fall that statistically leads to death 97% of the time), but the instant he did so, in midair, he was hit by a horrifying realization: \"I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was in fact totally fixable - except for having just jumped.\"\n With that sudden desire to live, Baldwin managed to change his body posture just before impact so that he hit the water feet-first rather than head-first (which would have meant certain death.) Even hitting feet-first, the only possible survivable posture, he still suffered numerous, severe injuries to his body. But he did survive, and went on to tell the tale and live a transformed life.\n If you are ever suicidal, for whatever reason, please take his words to heart - whatever you may feel in your life is \"unfixable\", may in fact be totally fixable or something that can be lived with. Don't wait until you're in mid-air after having leapt from a building or bridge to come to that realization.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/rs66fz3j3o6a1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=943e3b1449852d757d909e621044ca4a3720971e\n    submitted by    /u/chudayroi  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the time of my birth, my dad was an Australian citizen (so I got Australian citizenship automatically) and my mum was a Vietnamese citizen. My mum has Australian citizenship now but she never gave up her VN citizenship (not sure if she automatically lost it).\n I currently have my mum’s birth certificate, national ID (CMND) from the 80s, and old VN passport from the 90s (expired). Would this be enough for me to apply for my first VN passport? Any other Australians went through the same process?\n Asking my mum to renew her passport is completely out of the question so I’d like to know if I can do this myself lol.\n I’ll call the consulate in Sydney some time but just wanted to hear from others first. 😊\n    submitted by    /u/GullibleSwordfish70  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I order it with no ice, no sugar. Why?\n For a couple of reasons, it’s faster for the employees to make, and I like my coffee black. Anywho, the coffee only cost 12k. I noticed, that the first few times I had ordered my coffee, some of the clerks would fill it a little less than half of the cup. Now! That I have consistently go there everyday, I get the best coffee around town. O don’t even need to tell them my order, instead the clerk would automatically ask me, “black? No ice, no sugar?” I love it! Plus, this time comes around there’s this clerk that just doesn’t care about the amount he gives me. The dude fills it to the brink. Kudos to him!

I also always call them by their name or nickname, unless it's someone I'm not that familiar with.\n ​\n It's kind of like insisting on calling someone \"Doctor\" or \"Sir\" after they've already allowed you to call them by name, like they want to keep the relationship distant to less than acquaintances, which is fine if that's what they want, I won't have to join their drinking sessions anymore haha.\n ​\n Is this normal in vietnam? I have a vietnamese friend that says in their language they just call each other by name, but when I discuss it with the teachers they say they are just being \"polite\" in their culture. I even told them I prefer to be called by my name and they still say, \"hello Teacher.\"\n    submitted by    /u/Vivoras  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, \n 8 days ago, I began catching online predators in Vietnam. I have 3 catches already. Yesterday, I caught my first teacher. That didn't take long. This guy was an English Teacher at an international school here in Vietnam. \n He was immediately fired from his school, his apartment was contacted and they notified police immediately. He is losing his work permit. His embassy is aware of the situation. \n It is very scary to think there are teachers out there trying to meet up with kids for pleasures. Thankfully, he met me instead of a kid and I reported ALL INFORMATION to proper authorities. \n You can watch the catch on YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I will continue to do my part to protect the community and children in Vietnam. \n I know some of you were skeptical about my original post when I said I was going to do this. 3 catches in 8 days is the results so far. Again, all evidence against each predator is always submitted to local authorities, employers, family members, embassies and whomever else may need it. That is all I can do on my end. \n Much love to all of you! Thanks for your time. Will continue to update the community when new catches come out as you may know this person. Share, share, share and make others aware of these guys.\n    submitted by    /u/SaigonSterling  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do we bring cash and try to exchange it instead? What is the best move? \n As i understand, she will be able to open a bank account there once she has her work visa done. With that said, we will have substantial spending for first month and she won't get paid until the end of the month (finding apartment, 2 months deposit plus first months rent, food, necessities etc). I am thinking we need to bring enough USD cash with us otherwise we will get destroyed with foreign exchange fees? I also read there are limits on daily withdrawals? Is it feasible to bring USD and exchange it at gold shops? Is there a limit how much they will exchange? What about airports?\n ​\n Any advice or ideas would be appreciated it.\n ​\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Yukzor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had learned through online resources the way you hi to people is “Xin chào” for formal and just “chào” for informal. I took Spanish the last two years of school and had learned to use “usted” to say “you” formally to people older than you or to higher-ups, so I assumed I would use “Xin chào” to greet my family. When my dad picks me up from school, I began to greet him with “Xin chào,” but recently he told me I would actually say “Con chào ba” to greet him or anyone else (pronouns changing depending on person). I was curious if that was a regional thing (my dad is from south vietnam but my bà nội is from north vietnam/south china) or if that’s a general thing among all vietnamese people?\n    submitted by    /u/LittleStar385  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can buy food, deal with money, understand classroom commands etc. Obviously, I'm a teacher.

As in, I'd like to know the grammar rules and stuff. I know not everyone learns that way, but I quite like to learn theoretically! This will be my fourth language to learn, so I feel like I have an idea of how I best learn. (I am not fluent in my third, but have learnt enough to get by in simple situations, which is kind of what I'm aiming for here).\n I am thinking of asking one of the Vietnamese teachers I work with for a lesson once a week but my schedule doesn't allow time for much more. Self study would be ideal for me, especially reading, grammar and vocab. I have lots of short pockets of time to kill between lessons. I have a handle on most of the tones, but that's what I would focus on with an in person teacher (tones, pronunciation etc).\n Any resources to recommend?

I also feel that most tours and guides around the world play it very safe and conduct their tours in the most uncontroversial or unchallenging ways possible, which can be problematic for someone who wants to hear about a problematic or contested period of history. I've even been on a few tours in Central Europe (ahem Hungary) that went far the other way with very conservative nationalistic and revisionist recollections of historical moments, but I feel it's difficult to find guides or tours with a collectivist mentality.\n Does anyone have any tours or guides they can recommend to me for January? Or am I thinking too hard about this, and maybe the average Vietnamese guide does feel this way and want to share about their country through this lens? I just don't want a guide that gives me a Wikipedia summary of Saigon's political/social history because they think it's what I want to hear.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/Curiotravels  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am curious how popular it is for girls to dye their hair in Vietnam and if the elders were to complain if the girls dye their hair brown, blonde, red, blue, pink, etc?\n In my family (all Vietnamese, living in the US), my 85 year old uncle (aunt's husband) really hates hair dye to the point where if one of his family members dye their hair (ex. my cousin), he would yell at them. My cousin dyed her hair blonde and she ended up being scorned by him. He told her \"you look very ugly with the hair dye. Please un-dye the hair\".\n His daughter had cancer and had to undergo chemo and because she lost her hair, she decided to buy a wig. I think she went with the black hair wig because if she went with blonde, her father would disown her.\n Also, for some of my cousins (part of the uncle and aunt's side), they brainwash their children not to dye their hair. They say that not only does hair dye look ugly (even brown or blonde hair because one part is light and the other is dark), it causes cancer as well. According to them, if their children dye their hair, they will get grounded (maybe even spanked) and they might get disowned by the family because they are seen as 'rebellious'.\n I definitely don't view that way and I view hair dye as a person's identity and personality.\n  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the duration of my stay, the department of education in Yen Bai didn’t grant me the work permit because they were confused about my BA which is a degree in English Language Teaching. Therefore, I’ve started looking for a job in Hanoi but my visa is about to expire. \n During one of my interviews, an employer told me that I had to do a visa run because I don’t have a work permit. Is this correct or are there any ways that the employer may not know about? If it is correct, what is the cheapest way to do a visa run? I’ve done research about it and found some information but if there is anyone here who knows about this stuff or has had a personal experience like this, I would like to hear from them cause I’m in a dire situation.

Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, etc). With that said, since I wanted to go around HCMC, go to Binh Duong, and maybe go to Nha Trang and back (I am planning to go there by myself), should I buy a motorbike or should I rent a car?\n I am also curious about road conditions in Vietnam if they are any good or not (things change a lot in three years as Vietnam is quickly developing) and plus, are trains/buses any good or should I just stick with the motorbike and the car?\n    submitted by    /u/MustLow10GM  \n [link]   [comments]",

I get nothing from this except I just want to support her. \n She makes custom lessons depending on what you want to learn and you’re learning style.

Guessing the humidity's gonna be tough to adjust to at first so I'll start off aiming for 5km runs (at a slower pace than usual) and see how I go from there. \n Any suggestions are welcome. Looking to avoid crowds and traffic where possible so my image is that (for example) a trail run or a loop around a big park/lake would be ideal. \n Open to tips on hydration and prep as well (including some food that's gonna go down well as I'm not a massive fan of Vietnamese cuisine outside ban xeo, a simple pho (no 'special' ingredients), banh hoi and fresh fruit/veg. \n I've never run in Vietnam but I've run during Japanese summers and am picturing something pretty similar in terms of humidity (i.e. I had to do shorter distances at slower speeds otherwise I'd get exhausted/dehydrated really quickly). Looking forward to adding a few solid Vietnamese runs to my Strava and (hopefully) improving my conditioning through this.

The guard didn't let him go inside because this is a private property, not a complex building.

A local man then came out and explain to JMG in English that he is the owner of this building, there's no other person inside and he is making a big mistake. \n JMG friends arrived and admit they gave him the wrong address then rush inside another house to save a dying man. The police arrived at the scene later and JMG was very uncooperative, refuse to admit that he was assaulting an elderly man and insult them. \n Now JMG is running a public relation campaign, trying to pay the press about how his actions are just, that everything he did was trying to save a man from heart attack, and he just a bit strong handed with the guard.\n    submitted by    /u/the_silent_asian  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not really interested in European/western flavors or designs or characters, I hope to find something generally like this. \n I can't speak Vietnamese so phone communication might be difficult, but of you know any such bakeries with an email address, I can surely translate a request and send it on to them.

Or are the waters so still that boats are barely rocking? \n \nSecondly, we are trying to decide between Ha Long Bay or Lan Ha Bay. Which would you recommend for a first timer? Seems like Ha Long Bay is a little more spectacular and can walk inside caves but super duper touristy, Lan Ha Bay slightly less touristy but a little less grand? Or is it just worth it to go to both?\n \nIs it worth it to stay on Cat Ba? It seems like we'd have a slightly less hectic experience if we spent a couple of days on Cat Ba and did some hiking or kayaking, is it worth going to? \n \nIs there easy to access and regular public transport from the North of Cat Ba where the ferry drops off to the South where hotels are? Apparently there are buses and taxis bit not sure how easy they are to get or how regular.\n \n Thanks for any help! :)\n    submitted by    /u/anna_b_1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys. Me and my husband are traveling to Ho Chi Minh City 16th of Jan 2023, were we will spend 3 days before flying to Phu Quoc 20th and staying there for 11 days. We are mostly traveling to Vietnam for the food, culture and to just enjoy the weather and the beaches. I have 3 questions. 1. Should we be worried that tet starts 22nd of Jan, if we want to visit local restaurants and museums in Ho Chi Minh City? 2. Do you have any recommendations for authentic Vietnamese food in any of those places? 3. What are some must see places in Phu Quoc?\n    submitted by    /u/Successful_Bottle597  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am on a visit in Vietnam after a very long time (last time I was here was when I was a small kid). Basically, I am visiting all my close and not so close relatives and most of my aunties and uncles are giving me money as a gift. What is the etiquette in Vietnam about accepting/refusing such gifts? I really appreciate their love and I am thankful they want to gift me money, but I don't really need money. For me it's enough that I can meet them and spend time with them after such a long time. They all come from wealthier backgrounds so they are gifting me large amounts of money (in the range of hundreds of dollars basically), I would prefer to refuse the money - is that acceptable in Vietnam or is it a taboo and I have to accept the money gifts?

It seems like there is no consensus on Hoi An, some people say it should only be a day trip and other people wish they had spent more time there. I have a mid-budget and care most about trying great food, having unique accommodations, beautiful scenery, and being able to go on cool day tours. I'm not interested in shopping so Hoi An does not sound very appealing. I fly out of Da Nang which is why I thought it would make sense to stay there and make a day trip to Hoi An. It also seems like similar tours are offered from each location. \n My rough itinerary is as follows: Hanoi - 2 nights; Ha Long Bay - 2D/1night then bus to Ninh Binh - 1 night, overnight bus to Phong Nha - 4 nights then train to Hue - 1 night; then easy rider to Da Nang/Hoi An - 2 nights.\n    submitted by    /u/AmaleekYoaz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, \n Long story short, I was put up for adoption to live a better life in America when I was 2 (mistake child, have 2 biological brothers 10+ years older than me). I grew up in a great family in the states, but I’ve always wanted to go find my biological family. Right before COVID I traveled to Vietnam for 30 days to try and find my family. I found them after a few days and lived with them for the remainder of my time there and I’ve gotten very close to them these past couple years.\n I am going to visit them here soon for Tet and want to give them money and gifts. How much money should I give them (enough to be generous, but not enough for them to rely on me)? And what gifts should I bring? My two brothers have 2 kids each and they are all mid-teens, so I bought each family laptops for school / college. I was thinking candy? I had a bunch of candy that I had brought last time and the kids loved it. \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Icy_Beautiful1683  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was wondering if people in Vietnam are familiar with these two fun games, and how common they are. If not, what are some other popular games people in Vietnam like to play?

My family lived through the worst period in Vietnam history before we left for the U.S. \n A lot of Vietnamese (here on Reddit) hate Vietnamese Americans because we are anti-communist and accuse us as traitors. While Vietnamese Americans accuse Vietnamese in Vietnam as brainwash idiots.\n However, if we lived in each other shoes, we would probably do the same thing that each side accuses each other off doing. \n If you lived through the war and saw your people murder and torture by the communist government regardless if you are from Northern or Southern Vietnam, you would not be pro-communist. Similarity, if all you learned in school was the Vietnam War (American War) from the perspective of the winner (North Vietnam), then your view will be in favor of the current regime. \n Our views, experiences, attitudes, behaviors are shaped base on the context of our lives and those of our families. \n But one thing that we can agree on is that we want Vietnam to become a develop country.\n    submitted by    /u/Chris7thLegion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I principally lived in France, and I did not learn vietnamese when I was younger, I knew a little from previous trips. I am currently Việt Nam for 3 months by myself (it's been more than 2 months now) and I am speaking a lot better, can hold conversation. Somehow, most of the people here see me as a foreigner. When I approach them (bằng tiếng việt) they stare at me & hit me with the \"tây ạ?\" and ask me why I can speak vietnamese. I have to explain myself pretty much every time to anyone speaking to me, & also not to have the tourist prices haha. Also every time I go to the countryside, everyone stares at me like & talk about me like I don't understand them lol.\n ​\n It hurts me as I always considered myself vietnamese, as I lived with my việt kiều mom most of my life and growing up w vietnamese culture, I feel very vietnamese to put it simple haha. It starts to make me feel a bit sad, & even sometimes I feel wrong not to look viet enough & don't feel like I belong to this community. Everybody in France can tell I am asian from my features, but here I am a foreigner to them.\n ​\n Do you have any tips on how to approach this situation? Does anybody have been through the same experience? I think it would make me feel better to know that I am not alone in this. \n ​\n Cảm ơn mngười! :)\n    submitted by    /u/ljmsn  \n [link]   [comments]",

What does it usually cost? Please give me an idea of what to expect in cost to rent!\n I've asked around and see that a lot of places only allow you to rent if you plan to stay for 6 + months. I would rather have it month by month since I don't want to run into the same issue I am having now with my current place.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/always_avg  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Because Vinfast is popular in Vietnam with the Vinfast Fadil being one of the best sellers in the past three years, do you think Vinfast would be popular towards Vietnamese Americans, given the fact there are many Vietnamese Americans who are anti-communist (like many of my mother's relatives who live in the US)?\n Also, I am curious if Vietnamese Americans are willing to buy a Vinfast or would they choose another car (like a Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Volvo, Porsche, VW, Polestar, GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, etc)? For me, even though I was born in Vietnam and currently live in the US (my parents still live in Vietnam however), I am not thinking of getting a Vinfast as there are many EVs which offer better value for the money, in my opinion (like Hyundai Ioniq 5, where there is a better brand cachet).\n    submitted by    /u/ToyotaCamryRAV4  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello. For years I've been using a Garmin 66i for my hiking across Europe and North America. I recently started travelling to Vietnam for work, spending weeks at a time there (4 trips this year already, 82 days in country total - just since August). I brought my 66i and I've been doing hikes with some of the locals on the weekends. It's been amazing. However, I've come to find that my Garmin has almost no detail about any of the areas I hike in. No trails, no contour, no roads. Many times it is blank. It's fine for tracking where I go, should I need to find my way out, but it's a pain to try and plan or navigate some of our hikes when I can't really see what is out there.\n I checked Garmin's website and there's no maps to purchase. There seems to be third parties selling SE-Asia maps but I can't really get a read on how trustworthy they are.\n Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations? I'm heading back out in a few weeks for a 6 week trip, one week of which we'll be going deep into the woods in northern Vietnam for 4 nights 5 days hiking and exploring caves. I'd like to have my garmin properly giving me information.\n    submitted by    /u/OldManKiK  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I am planning to visit Vietnam soon, and it occurred to me that New Years Eve is approaching soon, and I was wondering if this is a good time to visit Vietnam.\n I am interested in meeting local people, not so much interested in simply partying and getting plastered with other expats/tourists. Are the local people of Vietnam keen on hanging out for NYE celebrations? Or is the lunar new year more popular of a holiday in VN?\n Also, what are some good ways to meet people and learn about the people and culture in VN? From what I've read, if you look like a foreigner (I am 190cm white guy from America lol) people will talk to you if they see you eating by yourself and are generally quite friendly. Is this true? I'd love to meet people and feel warm and welcome, unlike when I went to Australia and it felt almost the same as America--super lonely and hard to meet people.\n    submitted by    /u/Pollo_Perpetuo  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I have been denied by Hanoi immigration due to a 'immigration violation'. \n I still do not know exactly what the problem is and how to fix it! I am more than happy to pay a fine. I have tried many times to call and email Hanoi immigration but still no reply. I even visited Vietnam embassy in Thailand and London but they couldn't help. \n Is there anyone that can help me or give me a contact with someone that works in VN immigration so I can speak to them directly and fix this problem. \n I have wasted a lot of money and time on agents who take my money under many promises but then do not help at all!\n I am a British citizen and currently living in London.
