Can anyone suggest the best spots for paragliding that won't break the bank? The prices I've seen online are crazy – nearly $100 for one person! I'm sure the locals might have some better insights. It's more expensive than the 5-star hotel I'm staying at, which is pretty amusing! 😄\n Also, besides paragliding, I'd love recommendations for other fun activities in the area. Any local favorites or must-do experiences? Thanks a bunch!\n Edited: Moreover, Is this national park worth going with a tour guide or DIY should be fine? https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/11139-trekking-bach-ma-national-park-day-tour-hue/\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Pomegranate_4611  \n [link]   [comments]",

It didn't happen because of how unexpectedly quickly the RVN forces fell to the North, although Cambodian forces did briefly take Phu Quoc after the fall of Saigon before being expelled. And then ultimately crushed in 1978 when the battle-hardened Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia. \n It got me thinking about what would have happened if he had invaded the much weaker South Vietnam, assuming it hadn't collapsed so quickly. Could he have pushed through to Saigon? Would China, who preferred to have Vietnam divided, have provided more support?

Now that my mom retired to Vietnam, she has CCCD and Ho Khau. \n We asked Aunt say to transfer land back to my mom's name, she refused. She gave a lame excuse like \"Oh, when I die, I will put you on the will paper, transferring the land to you. Don't worry nobody will live in your house\". (She has the red book, it means she could easily sell the land and house right?) \n My aunt is a 60 year old, childless, never married woman.\n I have a video recording of the aunt admitting that my grandma gifting the land to my mom, and the whole village (it's small) knows that we bought the land and house 15 years ago. I have many aunts and uncles and nighebours that can be the witness, if that means anything in court.\n Thanks. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Odd_Introduction9656  \n [link]   [comments]",

One thing I noticed, particularly in shops, cafes and restaurants is that while in the other countries (even hyper expensive Singapore), buildings were usually an arctic blast the moment you walk in, a lot of places in Vietnam often only have 1 AC unit running, AC set to a high temperature or areas of the premises partitioned off for \"cleaning\".\n I also noticed they usually just open the windows in the morning in spite of the noise, heat and pollution, waiting till the heat was unbearable before finally shutting the windows and turning the AC on and would sometimes turn off the AC 30 minutes or more before closing time. Is it really that expensive to run AC in Vietnam? . . Disclaimer - before the \"all police\" chime in, obviously not all Vietnamese businesses are like this and I'm sure they do this in other countries too but that besides the point.\n    submitted by    /u/Ripper31189  \n [link]   [comments]",

He managed to get into a relationship with a local woman named Diep (out of respect I am not posting her full name) which he still reminisces of fondly to this day. He yearns to know that she is okay.\n Pics: https://imgur.com/shBetbb https://imgur.com/QinNwTP \n This is a shot in the dark but I wanted to at least let my Uncle know that I shared his story. I also realize that she and many others may have had a completely different perspective of things. Apologies ahead of time but this is about their relationship, nothing else. He is getting very old and this is one of the last things that he's never gotten closure on. If you know or knew this woman, enjoy the pictures. If you wish to share anything about her, please do.

So, does charity bring any meaning to the people there? Or is it a way for the children to see themselves as 'poor' compared to society?

          "description": "​\n ![img](i6pmivydq31c1 \" \")\n Mới vụ gần đây có một tiktoker bị bóc phốt vì nói lớ tiếng việt. Căn bản là bạn này sinh ra ở Việt Nam nhưng sống ở Mỹ cũng được nhiều năm. Mới gần đây, bạn ấy có đăng một vài video trong đó bạn nói tiếng Việt có bị chậm. Không biết là ai ném đá trước nhưng sau một thời gian thì có nhiều Tiktoker khác bu vào chửi bới và khinh bỉ rằng OOP giả bộ không biết Tiếng Việt để tỏ vẻ Mỹ Trắng.\n Lúc đầu thì mình cũng ngỡ ngàng tại vì mình sống nước ngoài cũng khá lâu. Mình chưa bao giờ tiếp xúc với người Việt gốc nào giả bộ nói lớ tiếng Việt để “làm màu”. Những comments mình đọc được thì cũng nhiều thành phần nói thẳng ra là vô cùng vô văn hoá và thiếu suy nghĩ. Bao nhiêu người, già hay trẻ, xô vào để cấu xé cô gái có 22-24 tuổi làm vài video giải trí trên mạng. Rồi nhiều Tiktoker còn tự chế thông tin kêu là bạn này mới qua được một năm, bạn này bắt chước hoa hậu nào đó cũng bị lớ giọng sau khi học nhiều thứ tiếng. Thật sự là mình hơi ngạc nhiên khi thấy tình trạng bóc phốt bây giờ nhỏ nhặt đến mức chỉ nói lớ tiếng Việt là ăn chửi. Liệu Tiktok VN bây giờ có thô thiển quá mà chỉ toàn “The Drama”, kiếm nạn nhân để mà chửi câu view hay không? \n    submitted by    /u/poorboy2022  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a white guy travelling slowly by train and stopped in a small station called Bong Son 80km north of Quy Nhon then went 15km north with a taxi. There's obviously very little tourism there especially westerners so at least 1/3 of people say hello or ask questions, kids come running to me etc but mostly positive encounters.\n Of course some laugh at me because I'm a 185cm dude on some tiny multicolor bicycle I got from my hotel roaming the dirt roads but I don't mind.\n But today I was cycling at this spot https://maps.app.goo.gl/WJqaow9SXyUgEGic9 and a young guy around 16yo on a scooter stopped me in the middle of the road and was quite angry for some reason. Couldn't speak a word of english and I can't speak vietnamese. He left after maybe 2 minutes so I kept going the same way (down south to get to a creek) and he turned back, turned again and was behind me and gave me a kick with his foot in the back of my bicycle.\n I realised he certainly didn't want me to go that way for some reason so I turned back and I didn't see him again.\n Any idea what happened there ? It's not like there were house nearby or I was in a private property.\n    submitted by    /u/kaiben_  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's so incredibly different, for context, I'm Vietnamese Australian and being here made me fall in love with the life here, although maybe that's idealistic but living in a western society for so long made me realise how deeply problematic the social system and dynamic are, it might work for some and it might not work for others but I love it here, btw this is my first solo trip and well... So far here's my experience, the ho Chi Minh song from vietjetair is stuck in my head, I feel a deep sense of pride for him even though I wasn't born here,I oddly comfortable here, I ate Banh mi Huynh hoa, I spoke to the locals, I got scammed but hey it's all experienced so I'm not mad, just a little disappointed but hey it's life. People are helpful, willing to help.\n So I guess this probably a very adventurous start, and a big welcome to Vietnam.

We enjoy nature and calm but also maybe a place with a couple bars where we can meet people and also some nice cultural events. We were thinking somewhere north and we are not sure if we are going to stay very long in the south because of the hot weather. ( We like the cold!) Eventhough our flight back home will be leaving from Ho Chi Minh City. We are in Hanoï right now and we are craving for a place much less busy and quieter (we have been in cities for the past 3 weeks).

I just found the 30M information on the recruiter's profile.\n Thanks to you, from my understanding it may be great for a local but not for an expat. Let's hope their package is evolving if they want to hire an expat, or let's pray that they forgot a number !\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/ondolondoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ran across the work of Mark Alves, a linguist who basically reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of Vietic language. And I started to realise how Vietnamese really kinda stands on its own as being a SouthEastern and East Asian language. I don’t why but this was my shower thought about why there is so much Chinese built within Vietnamese language.\n I noticed in his work there was a lot of old Chinese (and of course other dialects and Chinese words over history) still used in Vietnamese. I had a weird shower thought that Vietnamese language seems like a sponge for Chinese language, if they didn’t have an existing word for it they just take it from their big neighbours. And I think hearing from my family about colonialism isn’t the whole story why there’s so many words adopted. I’m curious about if anyone knows if there are studies on this.\n    submitted by    /u/KeiHaruki  \n [link]   [comments]",

We can’t get off the train, and we’re not being given any information by the staff, or the tourism company the train service is with. There’s not much food or water, and the staff are hiding from us. \n I’m starting to get quite worried and stressed. Does anyone know when the floods will recede? Or could we be stuck here on the train until the weekend or longer? We’re scared we will run out of food and water and power soon. We definitely won’t move until morning now. \n We would get off and try to find a car to take us back north, but it’s dark and too risky, we don’t know the situation out there. \n Please stay safe everyone in the region!\n Edit: woke up. We’ve still not moved. We’ve been on the train for 36 hours+ now. It’s still raining heavily. My boyfriend is starting to get sick and is coughing with no water. We’re starting to get very sad and scared. We haven’t seen any staff members for 10+ hours. We’re not at a station so can’t get off. We’re on a ‘tourist carriage’ so no Vietnamese to ask for help. We’re ‘safe’ physically from the rain, and I’m grateful for that, but I’m so fed up of not knowing. At this point, we just want to fly back home from what was meant to be our dream trip. I feel so, so guilty for suggesting we take the train 😭 \n Edit 2: staff has abandoned us. We cannot find them. We have had news and no supplies for 12+ hours. Everyone is leaving the train and trying to escape now. We know it’s not safe, but we will also risk leaving now while it’s still light and the rain has stopped for a while.

It’s supposed to be the combined limit for the carry-on and the personal item, but both are usually over this limit. Any carry-on under 7kg would be mostly empty. \n I don’t care if an airline wants to make more money and charge more. They can certainly do so, but they should have reasonable rules and clear prices.\n I just had a bad experience checking in to a VietJet flight where the employe made me empty my carry-on and put half of the things in my big bag and half in my backpack. They checked in my big bag which was now slightly over the 20kg limit and my almost empty carry-on. They kept telling me to make my backpack lighter, but it was that heavy because of my laptop, iPad and battery pack which can’t be checked in because they contain lithium batteries. I kept asking them what to do, but even they didn’t know the solution and eventually just let me go.\n    submitted by    /u/usdavor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "👋 hello. American looking for authentic cha gio here in the states. Specifically, many Vietnamese restaurants use egg-based (yellow) roll wrap paper and not the clear, white rice paper. I was always told that the yellow one was the Chinese way of making them, and that proper cha gio were made with the clear ones. (Is this true?) Personally, I prefer the clear white wraps 100% of the time. I’m disappointed when I order cha gio in a restaurant and I get the yellow kind. Does anyone know how I can ask what kind of paper they use and what answer reflects my preferences? Will a Vietnamese restaurant look at me sideways for even asking?\n Thanks!\n Background: American, but my (White) grandmother was born and raised in Vietnam. Our family has since adopted some Vietnamese dishes as part of our family culinary traditions, including thit koh, bun thit, and cha gio.

He kept saying stuff like “no betch” and “that’s right girl, he ain’t all that”.\n Then we heard the sound of another foreigner and he also sounded effeminate. He seemed to be trying to flirt with the first guy. The first guy suddenly pretended to be all macho and changed his voice. We were like bruh.\n We heard what sounded like hands grabbing plump body parts and we heard some kissing. Then the other gay guy got even madder and was saying stuff like “you know you don’t like them, you big faker” and then we heard footsteps storming off.\n So we all just chuckled and went on with our meal.

I was minding my own business and having fun with three other Viet women. They were like 45 kilograms of chicken these women. The women were enjoying themselves with the drinks I was buying. I was balling out with these 45 kilogram chicken and they were loving it. Then all the sudden this crazy tourist comes over trying to be a hero and tell me to take my hands off the product. I ignored him as I paid for these women, so I kissed them. He said something again about me touching the woman. So I grabbed the women again to piss him off and kissed them as well. The guy looked miserable. Like he had come to vacation with his wife and mother in law. He was jealous as I left my wife and mother in law at home. Why would you bring that kind of sand to the beach? There is plenty of sand here to play with. Any how, the women were having fun and enjoying my company. These tourist should mind their business just like I was. We are some hard working men from Malaysia here for some R&R. These type of tourist confuse me. Are they here to vacation and have fun or play some fantasy superhero? If the women were in trouble they could scream or call the police. There was plenty of people around and we were all having fun. 🤩 Enjoy life my people.\n    submitted by    /u/chubrock420  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just a fun story I wanted to share, no offense to anyone who digs the style I‘m going to talk about.\n My dad migrated from Vietnam 30 years ago and what striked me almost my whole adolescent life was his particular style of clothing. Like everything has a luxury brand name on it. All in all it it’s this kind of „young money“ street style from 2010. Sunglasses, caps, LV satchel, expensive watch, you name it, paired with buddhist accessories. From a fashion standpoint it’s completely randomly combined. This stands out even more since no other 60 year old man dresses this way in the country I grew up in. Though I’d say especially migrant groups tend to do that as well as a status symbol though there‘s something, besides the jade bracelets and stuff, that makes it so different and I really can‘t say what.\n And then, in 2019, I visited Vietnam for my first time. And when I walked around Bui Vien street or took the local busses, I’ve seen other middle aged men that radiated some thuggish ominous vibe like bouncers and I realized They wear the same outfits!! I don‘t know what exactly made it so similar but the composition of their outfits reminded me immediately of my dad. I had the feeling they wore even more accessories like a watch but also a jade bracelet and a wooden pearl bracelet on the same arm. It‘s so weird hahaha but now I know, where he got that inspiration from\n    submitted by    /u/eggisch  \n [link]   [comments]",

Later on, he also replied a message to return the money on Oct 12. However, it has been a month since, and he has not returned the deposit. He refused my phone calls and never reply his reason not to return the money. Since sueing or asking for money is potentially problematic, I want to ask. 1. is it ok to ask his friends/wife/people at his place for his whereabouts? 2. how to sue now that I left Hà Nội and can't return. Would the government office, whatever that handles the case request me to be in Hanoi to carry on with the case? I also have heard that his wife works in the court and this will most likely thrown out. So how to make sure that the case will go. 3) there are many laws, on of which is the notorious 331 that puts people in prison for supposedly defamation of character.

          "description": "Around 9:30 PM tonight, November 11, 2023, I was passing through the Kim Liên tunnel, Hanoi, Vietnam. I was on the back of a fast-moving motorbike when I randomly looked up at the sky and saw many flashing, color-changing circles like these. These are original videos and ones that have been made to slow motion so you can see everything in different speed. At first, I thought they were lights from a crane on a high-rise building, so I looked away. But a few seconds later, I looked up again and wondered “what? hold on…” how there could be such a high building in the sky! I tried to take a photo but couldn't because the bike was moving too fast, so I recorded videos instead. It looked very surreal and strange in person. I've never seen anything like this before. Did anyone else passing by that area tonight look up and see the same thing? Could these be drones? Can anyone explain what this might be? \n diabayvietnam #diabayhanoi\n    submitted by    /u/Alarmed-Feeling-754  \n [link]   [comments]",

Especially in major cities like Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, the streets of Vietnam are a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds, where thousands of vehicles move incessantly. Foreigners may be surprised to witness the sight of motorcycles – the dominant mode of transportation in Vietnam – gliding smoothly through narrow streets, sometimes carrying an entire family or towering loads of goods. Alongside these, leisurely bicycles, creatively crafted homemade vehicles, traditional ‘Xích lô’, and even large trucks jostle together, creating a multi-hued tapestry of urban life.\n Read more: Unique Vietnam travel - Vietnam Traffic Challenge - VN Charm Travel \n Vietnam traffic at night\n    submitted by    /u/VNCharmTravel  \n [link]   [comments]",

My dad died drowning in the sea trying to escape a year before us. \n I've been in Vietnam for two weeks now and I was actually quite surprised by how much poverty there still is here.

I'm 5'11\" with a muscular build and I feel like freaking captain America walking around here. \n All this makes me very grateful for my life. But I also feel guilty because I realize everything I have was given to me. I didn't choose to the west. I am just a product of my parents and environment. It was my mere chance that I am where I am and who I am. One little change in my past, like my mom deciding not to try to escape or getting caught escaping and I could be in saigon trying to hustle like everyone else here. \n I am also saddened to see how much Vietnamese ppl struggle and work so hard in this ungodly humid and hot temperature.

We're currently in Vietnam for the first time and although it's exciting here, I'm getting tired of a few things that we're not used to. Almost every day we have been here, the locals try scamming us. From the street sellers who give me less change money than I'm supposed to get, the \"take a photo with my fruit basket on a stick\" and then heckling you to give photo money or buy something, \"take a free donut\", etc. It's wearing me down as I'm a very honest person and have tried my entire adult life to support little mom and pop shops with their businesses. We just spent 2 months in korea and a week in Japan and those locals were very honest, did not heckle, and if they offered a free sample, it was really free. Plus the lack of consideration. Last night at 1:30am, there is construction still going on like a circular saw and banging metal. I wake up to it, and have to sleep with it. Does the police or other locals not care about quiet sleeping time? We have never encountered something like this on a constant basis in any other country we've traveled to.\n We are scheduled to leave here next week, then off to Ho Chi Mihn for a week, and then after that we had scheduled Da Nang for a whole month but now considering canceling Da Nang if it's going to be more of the same. So for people who have traveled to Da Nang, can you tell me if we will be facing the same situation as here in Old Quarter Hanoi?\n ​\n We have met some really nice people in nice shops who offer us good service and the right change so we have been returning to those spots to eat.

          "description": "Hi I just wanted to give an update on this poll I did a while back: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/16jlwu5/market_research_for_handbagtote_bag_fashion_start/\n ​\n I'm slowly launching the tote bags that I described in the original post. I feel a little bit embarrassed to try to push this new project out there but what do I have to lose then to share my experience right?\n I am so thankful for the people who voted in the poll and gave their opinions. It really helped me narrow down my focus. This is a passion project that stemmed from a long overdue trip to Vietnam.\n I was born in a refugee camp in Malaysia and moved to Canada when I was 4. I only been to Vietnam once when I was 14 on a family trip. Then this year back in April I decided to go back to Vietnam on my own at the age of 30. It was an incredible experience reconnecting with family and making new friends as a solo traveler who can barely speak Vietnamese. I have to say that Vietnamese locals are so open and love to connect with foreigners - I think that's what makes the country so great!\n Anyways, I got a felt tote bag from a popular Men's wear brand there and walked around with it in Canada, constantly getting compliments on the bag. I decided to start my own brand selling these felt tote bags with my own designs. Right now the designs and branding is focused on the soft \"Asian\" girl aesthetic but I hope to venture beyond these tote bags to explore different aspects of being Vietnamese living outside of Vietnam. I feel that we are constantly trying to connect to heritage while building a unique Western-Vietnamese experience navigating two cultures.\n I hope you guys follow The New Win on social media and check out the website: bythenewwin.com.\n As you can see the poll winner \"Saigon District 1\" inspired the first design. I'm gearing up for the first Drop soon and I hope you check back for more Drops in the future.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/wowelephants  \n [link]   [comments]",

But on Sunday pictures were published in state media of an enormous construction site running through the waters – and next to the spectacular karsts – of Bai Tu Long Bay, which borders Ha Long.\n https://preview.redd.it/qx30sp82w8zb1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a5fb02c727f2e9c8d1592c76ff464a22ce0b3c\n https://preview.redd.it/ybid9i17w8zb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb5e2dc9c1995a35b2e91560842536e4fccde809\n  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even the prime minister's salary is only around 20,000,000 VND.\n This creates the first problem: because they are the only ones who can solve problems (administrative, legal) for the people. They will create barriers to make the problem more difficult to solve. To get bribe money.\n The higher their position, the more difficult problems they can solve, and the more bribes they can get. Because these positions can all be bought with money. This environment, of course, becomes a potential market for investment.\n  \nWant to become a traffic policeman standing at the intersection?

          "description": "Something I have noticed during my time in Vietnam is that in many of the stores, restaurants etc you go into (generally the more expensive ones) the staff give the ‘hello sir’ and then just sort of stand right near you and watch, as you browse, as you decide, as you calculate cash for the bill etc. I’ve even had it where there are multiple workers stood looking at me. I find it incredibly off-putting and it usually just makes me want to leave immediately as I feel under pressure.\n Has anybody else noticed this phenomena?

          "description": "From my many years of travelling, visiting all of Southeast Asia except Laos and Myanmar, East Asia and India, it's my first time an airport staff aggressively shouted at me. \n After the Immigration, the guy who checks your passport and boarding pass in the final security check, alerted me that there's an issue with my check-in baggage. He told me to wait in the waiting area. I was very nervous since it's the first time that my baggage was questioned. And I kept thinking of worst case scenario like finding illegal items and being fined etc. I was waiting for a few minutes and asked politely (saying \"Sir\") and he said that the staff from the airline is arriving. There's no one at the security screening at that point and after several minutes, asked him politely again, and then he shouted in a loud aggressive voice \"I TOLD YOU TO WAIT HUH. WAIT!! \" and I was shocked by that aproach. Even his fellow staff looked at him. \n I was shaken by his aggressive reply and just sat in my seat while he just turned his back at me. Fortunately, the airline staff arrived and accompanied me at the baggage screening. It was a pocket wifi and it's carry on only. After clearing, I went to other side of security and went to boarding gates.\n (Also earlier, the lady at the check-in counter seems very testy, the way she processed the check-in procedures) \n The staff at Saigon Airport seems to be in a lot of stress and not very friendly. I really had a bad experience on this Airport and it made a pretty bad impression as a visitor, , unlike the ones in Hanoi and Da Nang.. Honestly, from the attitude of staff and the whole airport experience (queueing, check-in), it's much worse than the comparable NAIA (Manila) T3. Next time, I will choose Da Nang or Hanoi Airport.\n    submitted by    /u/winterreise_1827  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a medium paced traveller, don't take things too slow but neither rush through the trip. \n I'm into cozy hotels (not too expensive), historical sites & museums, local food, drinks & coffee places. I'm not a nightlife person and usually stay away from crazy spots - doesn't mean that I don't like to visit and see them for a couple hours. I want to make the best out of my Vietnam trip. \n I'm planning the following route in my Vietnam trip for so many days:\n Hanoi 4\n Ha Long Bay 2 (Here I plan a one night trip where they come pick you up from hotel and return you the next day - any agency you'd recommend? looking at prices online I expect around 350 euro pp)\n Ninh Binh 2 (Saw that can be done as a day trip but many people recommend spending the night)\n Sapa 3 (Here is the most uncertain part of the trip, not sure if worth spending the 6 hours of train/bus to reach here, stay 1 full day, and return the 3rd day - any experiences on how to proceed best?) \n Hanoi 1 (coming back from Sapa and prepare for flight to Da Nang)\n Da Nang/Hue/Hoi An 5 (any idea how many days I should spend in each? I'm reading that Hoi An would be the best out of these 3 cities so I don't mind cutting 1 city to spend more time in Hoi An) \n HCMC 3 \n Phu quoc/ Con Dao 4 (I still have to decide which of the islands I should go to - price wise flight from HCMC is similar but I'm reading plenty of negative stuff on Phu Q so I'm leaning more towards Con Dao).\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/EvenPatience6243  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am open to more touristy options if they are really nice. I plan on doing a writing retreat and want as less distraction as possible, but would look forward for some nice mountain scenery or old village charm that i could easily stroll through on foot or bike.

But a memo went out where I work that it would be required next year (I think nationally it already is, but whatever....) Anyway, my BMI is very low even for Vietnamese standards 44-45 kg at 170 cm. I'm a man. Otherwise healthy although I have had my blood pressure tested in the moderate to high zone at times, although other times it was normal. Not sure if I had nerves at the exam, but it has come out high in some exams. Not sure if I have any other issues. I can teach 12 hours straight if necessary, not sure why we need a confirmation of what can be seen, but what could get my visa not renewed?

I didn't suffer any loss, and I knew that he was just an ordinary office worker who just wanted to complete his work.\n I guess maybe more people joined the tour group, but they didn’t have enough train tickets, so they randomly selected a few lucky passengers like us and lied to them.

Refund will be sent to subscribers. \n  \n\"Unplugging Prime Video: The What and The Why Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming arm, has been a part of Vietnam’s digital entertainment spectrum since 2016. The service, akin to Netflix, brought a plethora of international films and TV shows to Vietnamese screens. But come October 2023, active subscriptions will be cancelled, and full refunds will be issued. Additionally, Prime Gaming benefits will also become inaccessible.\n  \nWhile Amazon remains silent on the rationale behind this closure, industry insiders speculate Vietnamese regulations may hold the key. The country mandates transnational paid broadcasting services to obtain licenses—a hurdle that Amazon seems unwilling to surmount. However, this is merely conjecture in the absence of an official explanation.\"\n Source: https://bnn.network/tech/amazons-prime-video-service-to-exit-vietnam-highlighting-larger-cultural-representation-issue/\n They couldn't wait until the final episode of Gen V smh.

We drank coffee, smoked, talked through translate and had fun. I'm 19, he's 27 with a young child if that matters.\n We ended up meeting again, travelling around and he showed me some sights. At the end of the day he insisted I slept at his house. Here I sat with him and his younger brother, we talked and eventually I went to sleep.\n Next day, I have to leave early to book a bus. My Vietnamese friend/host also had to leave early. When I was about to leave I saw a woman and I asked him if that's his mom. He said yes.\n I told him I wanted to go thank her for letting me stay at her house. He declined. I insisted. He declined again, he seemed to really not want me to do that.\n His mom, who seemed to me doing some chores, didn't acknowledge me at all, not even look at me.\n I found this super weird.

I stayed 2 nights in Ha-long bay and four nights in Hanoi old quarter. The people of your country are some of the warmest people I have met in my life, your roads are so clean, and even though you feel you will be run over people coolly navigate around you. No one is rude to you on the other hand I was helped by locals from falling into a tourist trap, every country had good and bad people. The majority of your country had great people with big hearts. You don’t disrespect neither do you have a demeanor where someone can try to undermine or disrespect you, maybe the years of war and made you so strong yet so humble. Money is the basis of all economies yet in your country, majority folk don’t give it the importance it’s given the world over. Food was so fresh and the amount of fruits you eat and the fresh seafood shows on your flawless skins. The women take the cake in hard work and yet manage to look so elegant in whatever they wear, they are such boss ladies it’s commendable. There are other countries in South Asia which have built economies on sex work, yet yours keeps its head held high and aims to give a more wholesome experience to any visitor.\n I write this from my bed in India, sad and depressed at having come back from such a lovely country which I wish was like my second home!\n Thank you Vietnam 🇻🇳 🙏🏻\n    submitted by    /u/blacksabath60  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I never like taking taxis anyway, I usually use Grab but my mom is a little more old-fashioned so whenever I’m traveling with her at the Tan Son Nhat airport she insists on using a taxi. She is Native Viet and I am Việt kiều. \n First time, they scammed us to pay double/triple a normal fare price (and I know taxis to and from airport are already higher end, so it was double that price already). \n Second time I gave them the hotel address, which was a chain hotel. Dude didn’t want to drive across town and said this particular chain accepts any reservation at any of their locations so he dropped us off at the hotel chain spot close to the hotel. I was already suspicious when he said this, but my mom accepted it readily and didn’t argue. She’s been living in Vietnam for over two years now for retirement and also grew up here, so if she thought it was fine I wasn’t going to argue either, especially since I was exhausted from a long flight. Obviously it turned out not to be true and the hotel receptionist said as much and called us a cab to our actual hotel reservation. \n Even after these two incidents my mom still goes to the taxis when leaving the airport as she says there are no other options. However, to book a Grab car to pickup from airport you just have to walk to the airport parking lot and they’ll pick you up from there. She struggles with technology and apps though and still feels more comfortable using the taxis even knowing they’re overpriced and scammy. But for anyone who’s comfortable with using apps and booking a Grab, go for that option. Teach the older folk how to use it too. These taxis are atrocious.\n    submitted by    /u/vavido  \n [link]   [comments]",

Perhaps with a different company, or if there were a different demographic of people in my tour group, I would have stuck it out, but my gut is telling me to leave. Some odd things have happened that are not just related to the party culture. These people are racist. Guys, always trust your gut.\n Hi all, I (20F, poc) scheduled a Ha Giang easy rider loop tour through a hostel after all the rave reviews online. I arrive, and quickly realize that this is all just one big excuse for young white European people to drink and party. I felt extremely uncomfortable my first night here, before the tour starts, as I did not come to Vietnam to drink with strangers, don’t like these people in my group, and am uninterested in the tourist drinking and partying scene. I don’t know why I didn’t do better research to see what a terrible tourist trap Ha Giang has become. I wanted a beautiful nature motorbike tour, but I am thinking of canceling because I don’t want to drink and don’t want to be the only person of color in the group, already half-excluded.\n Has anyone felt the same way when visiting Southeast Asia, and how did you avoid this? I’m here to travel solo, decompress, enjoy nature and different cities and locals, not interested in making friends with other tourists.\n And now, I’m not sure what to do. Is the loop still worth it if I don’t want to party at night and just feel uncomfortable with the people in my group? I’m thinking of just bailing and going back to Hanoi, which I loved.\n    submitted by    /u/Personal-Elevator-88  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well me and my mom thought about it and we’d like to avoid just that in the future. \n Backstory: my mom is Vietnamese but lives in Sweden. Her brother is holding either half (or on the contract, currently holding) her house for her until she retires and moves there in the future. Now grown up and having seen my family members patterns, I’m almost too sure that a conflict will arise in the future from this. Mainly between my moms brother, and his wife. The two aren’t too fond of each other. Another red flag I noticed during a trip to VN one summer was that my uncle started tearing up and making a whole scene in front of everyone when my mom just calmly asked for her name to also be included on the papers for the house. He was screaming about being accused of being greedy when no one approached it that way. I felt like he was scared and projecting. \n Any advice is appreciated. I’d hate to see my family members fight over four walls in the future. \n PS. This property was gifted to specifically my mom from her parents. My grandparents made sure each one of their kids got a retirement property.\n    submitted by    /u/moontro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I share the same sentiment. And I was born and raised in Vietnam. Every once in a while you run into someone who’s kinda old, but not that old, and you don’t know if you should call them anh or chú. \n Same with the women: idk if they’re old enough for me to call them cô or chị without offending them\n Edit: Just remembered something else about pronouns so figured I’ll blow y’all mind. \n Within the family tree of Vietnam, you call your cousins anh/chị/em, not based on age but based on your parents age. In other words, if my father has a younger brother, and they both have children, my uncle’s kid would have to call me anh/chị regardless of age. This means it is possible that I am anh/chị even if I’m the younger cousin!!\n Another thing is if within a family tree, a person is on the same generation as your parents, you call them cô/dì/chú/bác. So for a large family with 1st generation of 5, it is possible to have some people of the 2nd generation younger than some people in the 3rd generation!! But the people in the 3rd generation still have to call the 2nd gen people cô dì chú bác cậu mợ, regardless of age\n    submitted by    /u/VNeseBanana  \n [link]   [comments]",

I should be getting a little bit higher salary, but the condos seem so much more expensive that it might not even make sense.\n I'm looking around at condos just through google search (DotProperty, RentApartmentVN, etc) and I haven't seen anything for less than $390. Or around 10 million VND. These condos look like normal condos, with no furniture and maybe a swimming pool. In Bangkok I've got a normal condo, that came with furniture and swimming pool and gym for $280/month.\n It's hard for me to believe that HCMC is that much more expensive than BKK but I really don't know. I've seen people here say with $300 you could rent a mansion, but I'm not seeing anything like that all, not do I want a mansion. Just a 1 bedroom studio with a pool or gym or some kind of recreational thing to do at the condo, or in the area for around $300 USD, maybe around 8M VND, is that's reasonable. \n Is HCMC really that much more expensive in terms of renting a condo?

She said \"cô đó\" would be used more in the south than \"cô ấy\" as a 3rd person pronoun. \n I was wondering if this is correct or maybe I am misunderstanding her explanation?

I met this Vietnamese guy in the business meeting of my dad. Both of us are into each other. Although I look more like a Slavic person, I am always more attracted to Vietnamese people. He’s literally my type. I still have to travel between my mom’s country and Vietnam, and he’s busy, so we only see each other twice per month. Everytime we met, he still bought gifts for me. I also gave something back to him.\n I told him I consider buying a car , because I’ld settle down here in Hanoi. Then, two weeks later, a new Mercedes was sent to my apartment . Now, I have no idea how to buy something back to him. That Mercedes is worth over 2 billions VND. I don’t have billions to spend on a gift. \n My dad always teaches me “never take anything for free in Vietnam”. I can’t ask my dad for much money though. We are just dating, and I am not his wife. It’s weird for me to receive a big gift like that. Luckily, I don’t live with my dad’s family.

I cant find any option to choose an easy rider or not online. So where can I do this? \n Lastly what is needed for the loop?

          "description": "Sorry if my question is phrased wrongly, but I do not know how to phrase it better. As a westerner (or in this case, a person born from Vietnamese parents, but raised in the US), I never really engaged with the Vietnamese language and many of its cultural products (other than the food, but that is a given). \n I never really watch any Vietnamese shows or musics because it looked poorly made compared with other things, like American/Western sitcoms and anime. And looking at the posts on this subreddit, I see that the younger generation of Vietnam is also seem to take more interest in K-Pop, Anime, and other cultural media than their home media. So in that case, why should I take time to learn Vietnamese to engage with the media that even the younger generation seems to not take interest in? \n I know this question sounds superficial (and it is) and there are many reasons to learn Vietnamese (talk to relatives and the people of Vietnam, learn the ethmology/history of the language, just have knowledge of Vietnamese under your belt, etc. ), but many times the reason why a person learns about a culture and the language of that culture is because they engage with something in the culture that sparks them to learn more about the culture. But I do not see that spark personally. Vietnamese is not the spoken language in the world (meaning it is not really a global business language), doesn't really have a huge art/film scene, and vietnamese culture in general does not really spark a huge influence across the globe. So why should I learn Vietnamese?\n    submitted by    /u/greedson  \n [link]   [comments]",

We asked if they could forward us the confirmation they had on their side from such agency and they said they couldn't do that because it was with another department. We tried googling such agency and nothing comes up and again we don't have the confirmation from such agency either. We tried to argue we have not booked through an agency and again she refused to help us as she said we had booked through this so called agency that does not exist. \n We are 100% sure we booked with Vietnam airlines and we don't know what to do now. We have contacted the other department she mentioned but there's only an email we could contact. \n It feels like we are being scammed by the airline and not being helped. \n Has anyone had this issue before?\n Update: We were able to change it through this new email we received. Someone in the comments mentioned there's an Aberdeen based Vietnam airlines which would make sense for why this happened. They are trying to charge us the equivalent of a new flight now though...

It takes place in the 1920’s-40’s era and I’d love to get advice/opinions/resources for research on this character. I want her family to have moved to the USA when she was young (maybe around 12? She was born in 1892) But I’d love to know what kind of traditions the family might follow and bring with them to the states, what immigration was like at the time, etc. I know there were immigration rules in place at the time that might affect them and France was involved in colonialism in Vietnam at the time. I’ve had trouble finding any information on Vietnamese immigration to the USA before the war. I’d also like to be told about any history I should know that would affect this story, what people want me as a white writer to avoid when making a Vietnamese character, and what people want to see when it comes to Vietnamese women in fiction. So far I have her name as Chau Tahn Liên and I’ve named a few of her family members like her brothers, sister, parents, aunt and uncle, cousin, and paternal grandparents. I’d love to know if the name makes sense especially for the time or if i should make changes and what they should be. If you take the time to read and respond to this I want to say thank you in advance.

My friend (45m) and I (40m) are coming to Vietnam from about Jan 1 to Jan 31. \n Neither of us like planning much so right now I’m inclined to just book a hotel or air b and b for 7 days to start in HCMC and figure out the rest after we get there. \n We will probably bounce over to Thailand for a few days, maybe Cambodia and Laos and I have to pop up to Hong Kong to see a friend for a few days. \n Mostly we just want to explore and eat, maybe do some light hikes and we’ll probably both spend a decent amount of time alone. \n Is it pretty easy to work stuff out after we get there?\n Also, kinda random but is Amex accepted pretty widely there? I have other cards, but I prefer to use that one.\n    submitted by    /u/conlanolberding  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m excited and nervous since our Vietnamese is at best to get our orders right at restaurants. I could use any helps or suggestions. So far, we have looked into inclusive tour package that will take us from HCM to Hanoi and all the cities in between. What are the best gifts to bring to Vietnam from America? What to avoid or to watch out for in Vietnam? I appreciate as many suggestions as possible. BTW, also my first time flying outside of America.

          "description": "Hey all, \n I’m traveling to Vietnam in late November for about 11 days total. I’ll be spending 5 days in Hanoi and 6 days in HCMC. I’ve been to both cities previously, as well as Da Nang & Hue. So I’ve basically seen most of the touristy stuff there (including Ha Long Bay) and have decided to skip central VietNam entirely this time around.\n I’m thinking of making a side trip to Sapa while up north and potentially Da Lat or the Mekong delta while in HCMC. \n Is two days in Sapa enough time to see most things there or should I add an extra day? Is Da Lat worth checking out for two days or so? How about the Mekong delta? I know both cities are pretty touristy and I can live with that. I just want to check out new places and get out of the hustle of the big cities. \n Since I’ve done Hanoi and HCMC, I just plan on chilling, eating while there so my days spent in the smaller cities is flexible. \n Also, I know the weather is hot/humid year round, but should I expect rain during this time of year?\n Thanks for any suggestions or recommendations!\n    submitted by    /u/H_ade_s  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was on STEM OPT, and my employer was willing to sponsor my H1-B visa. \n Things were looking up for a bit, and I thought I could settle in America. However, my health worsened in September 2022, and I was constantly sick every month. I got a serious case of vertigo that made me spend a day in the ER in August. And then, a month later I got diagnosed with H Pylori, a nasty stomach virus that could cause severe heartburn. In December 2022, I got Covid after attending happy hour with my coworkers. I had to deal with all of these along with anxiety and depression. In March 2023, I decided to quit my job and move back to Vietnam because I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't even apply for the STEM extension or participate in the H1-B lottery. \n I moved to Saigon after coming back to Vietnam (I'm from Hanoi), but I still feel like a loser for coming back to Vietnam. When I set out to study in America, my goal was to get a job and a green card and then I would choose where to live. However, things didn't go as planned, and I am completely lost. I am scared of getting back into the corporate world because of what happened to me. I'm scared that my health will be in jeopardy again. I'm still looking and applying for jobs right now, but deep down I wish no one would hire me so that I could rest for a bit more. \n Now I'm completely lost because the goal that I had been working towards for 5+ years was squashed, and now I have no goals or directions.

We moved in a hotel in the tourist area for a month and almost every night at this outside Huda bar there was a white puppy sitting on a folding chair. He had a leash and tip jar next to him and I would always go up and pet him (I asked if I could pet him every time). And I fell in love with the little guy. So one day I went to the pet store near by and bought some puppy sized toys to give to him. When I saw the puppy again a few days later I patted him and gave him a rope toy to play with and we tugged it and all that cute stuff. I left him with the toy and saw the puppy about a week later without it. I never saw him since then. Is it bad here to gift a dog a toy? I had no bad intent or anything I just wanted to treat him. :(\n    submitted by    /u/JealousEmergency9921  \n [link]   [comments]",

Until they crank up the volume to absolutely outrageous level.\n I live in a very good place and very nice city, but unfortunately to me there are few villas nearby where drunk viet people like to sing karaoke almost every day up until midnight. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I understand they want to have fun. I understand they are drunk and don't care about other people.\n What I don't understand is why no one is doing anything about it? 20 drunk people affect thousands citizens who live nearby. Everyone is happy about noise? Can't believe it.\n Now the main part: there are four 5* star hotels near these villas. Classy, expensive, with good cars around it, etc et etc. Why management is doing nothing about drunkards in villas? It is so easy to call police. It is so easy to give them some money so they patrol this area a little more often. Submit complains, escalate problems to police superiors, even bribe if needed, etc etc. But why nothing? I live here for 6 months and problem doesn't go away. \n I have so many questions.\n Hotel customers don't complain even when karaoke blasts at midnight? Hotel management doesnt care about anyone? Police doesnt care about 5* star hotels?\n Maybe vietnamese customers dont care about noise even if they rich because they are used to karaoke from their childhood.

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n Sooo, I am a 26yo art student, viet born in western europe and would love to explore some contemporary art spaces and the creative wave that’s been happening and just learn about the people and the culture.\n The thing is that I visited last summer, the first time in 15 years and was with family most of the time. This was a beautiful experience but also, I was super annoyed with how paranoid my family was about me doing stuff alone. I always needed someone of my family to be there with me or someone they knew to escort me around for the most simple things like getting a juice around the corner. \n The main thing they’re scared off is me being sold, kidnapped or deceived and drugged, because I’m recognizable as a Viet Kieu and am female. Sometimes I get mistaken for being fully foreigner, like Thai or Indonesian, cause I don’t look like the typical Viet when it comes to my style or my accent, or whatever reason they say I don’t look like a typical viet. (fam also say I’m too ‘hiện’ lol)\n The thing is, I just want to explore places, meet likeminded creatives and enjoy my culture outside of the family. But is it true that I’m not safe doing things on my own? Can I really not take Grab’s without the chance of being kidnapped? Can I really trust no one?\n My family be saying crazy stuff like ‘dont go on dates cause if you reject him, he’ll drug you’ or ‘white people have it easier in VN than Viet Kieu’ 🤡\n Anyway, thoughts? I just wanna explore new spaces and hang out with new people but how my family puts it; I’m in danger as a female not viet-born person doing things on my own.\n    submitted by    /u/_honeyloops_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have 2 family members ( cousins ) that I loan money to a few years ago. 1k usd each, first cousin was for her start up business and the other was another 1k usd to take her mom to the doctor/big hospital in SG... Which she never took her, \" she got better \". I haven't talked to the 1st cousin with the start up business over a year, but I do have her FB. The second cousin agreed she would pay me back this Tet when I visit VN. She usually call and ask how I'm doing and such but after the loan and I found out she didnt take her mom to the hospital , she kinda went MIA. I do have proof and receipt when I transfer the money. \n Would it be rude of me if I just call them up out of nowhere to remind them that still owe me money? or should I just wait until I see them when I land and ask for it? \n anybody has experiences of getting your money back from family members, let me know lol. \n    submitted by    /u/Chubbypand4  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone! My husband and I are visiting Vietnam this upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. We are planning a trip with my parents who live in Vietnam for 5 days during the 2 weeks before the holiday. My parents want to go from Quang Binh to Hoi An in 5 days. They want to visit Phong Nha Cave, Paradise Cave, Hoi An, Da Nang, and Hue. The plan is that we will land in Da Nang and travel with them immediately.\n  \nWe will not use a tour agency so I am a little afraid of how many destinations they want to go to within such a small timeframe. Definitely, we will use public transportation to commute and that takes a lot of time to commute already. \n The current itinerary: Quang Binh (1 day), Hue (1 day), Da Nang (1-2 day), and Hoi An (1 day)\n I hate jet lag and I want to take it slow to adjust to the local time when I first land. \n We would like to enjoy the trip rather than move through each location super fast. We are considering tailoring in Hoi An for our wedding and it seems to not be doable with this iterary.\n I heard Hoi An is super crowded and 2 out of 5 days we plan to travel are weekends. \n We love our parents but at the same time, we really want to visit Da Nang-Hoi An without rushing it.\n  \nDo you think this is a good idea? How can we commute between places if this trip is doable?\n I am gearing towards traveling to Ha Noi (3 days) and Halong Bay (cruise-2 days) so that we can experience the Northern vibe of the Tet holiday and enjoy more time on the trip.\n    submitted by    /u/kttrxn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I went to Vietnam in June for a few weeks with my wife and daughter. We went to Ho Chi Minh City, Que Nhon, and Dalat. We decided to buy insurance from Berkshire Hathaway Travel protection. We chose the coverage that only covered medical emergencies. The price was less than 100$. Mid way through our trip my daughter became very sick fever ect. She had a bacteria infection which landed her in the hospital for anti-biotics when over the counter did not do the trick. We stayed at Vinmec got receipts for everything and ended up staying in the hospital for 7 days. The cost for everything came out to around 3,000. Vinmec gave us all receipts in English and Vietnamese. I opened a case with Berkshire while on Vietnam and they said I had a year to send all docs. When we got home I sent all receipts and charges from my credit card they also asked for bank statements and after 25 days I received a check for the full amount. They covered the hospital stay, medicine, emergency room visit too. It was my first experience with Berkshire but will use them in the future. I recommended this to my friend that also went recently and she also has to take her daughter to the hospital it wasn't expensive but it sounds like it was covered her bill was only 300$\n    submitted by    /u/jackhammer1198  \n [link]   [comments]",
