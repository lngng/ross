I am not sure about that in western, but in Vietnam, it is totally not true. In Vietnam, compared a person to a dog, no matter your intention, is a serious insult asking for violence. The similar one in the west is \"fu*k u bit*h!\" or \"you son of a bit*h!\". So yeah, just don't do it. The only exception is that you intentionally want to insult the other and want to have a fight :)\n Edit: as mentioned by some people \"cún\" (puppy) is fine for kids and girl friends to show that they are cute and you love them. \"chó\", on the other hand, is not ok.\n    submitted by    /u/vantubka  \n [link]   [comments]",

But of course I understand it's very tough back home and my family struggles often with money. \n One of my cousins is graduating high school this year and I just learned today that her parents are in no place to afford college tuition. They've all resigned themselves to that reality. My older cousin (different parents) also couldn't go to college and she makes 7 million a month, and the cycle of economic struggle persists. I'm in a position to send money for my little cousin's tuition, unfortunately couldn't help my older cousin in the same way. It is a no brainer for me. However, I want understanding of what higher education in Vietnam entails. More so out of curiosity and wanting to show support in learning about her experience than anything else.\n What is the cost? My family is based in Saigon, what are the schools nearby like, I don't think she is interested in being too far from family. Is it difficult to get into universities? What opportunities does a college degree afford? Googling I found the average entry level salary for a college graduate is 20-25 million. Any other information that comes to mind that I didn't think of?\n My mother didn't finish 8th grade due to poverty and hardship. My brother and I now have master's degrees, it is her greatest pride. I'm now a teacher, nothing is more important to me than education and knowledge.

And the reason for showing off such a generic, low-end car is because they are conveying that they are rich enough and important enough that they were able to afford a car in the early 90's, when this was an extreme rarity. \n Is this a real thing, or is there some other reason for this? Because I have only seen it a few times, but it has been more than once, so there has to be some reason that wealthy/well-connected people would choose to drive a 90's corolla or equivalent level car, right?\n    submitted by    /u/phedinhinleninpark  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A Vietnamese comment on Reddit told me that I am not Vietnamese if I don't see the fact the majority of people in Vietnam removed the right-side mirror of their motorcycle (if there are 7 motorcycles in the street, there are 5 motorcycles that have been removed the right-side mirror). But I don't see that in my city (Da Nang) and other Vietnamese cities I have traveled to. The vast majority of bikes have two mirrors on both sides. The percentage of bikes with the right-side mirror removed is so low that it is unnoticeable. This percentage may be as high as the percentage of motorbikes that lost the left-side mirror or the motorbikes that lost mirrors on both sides.\n Another Reddit comment assumes that I am Vietnamese but living overseas. And so on....\n I brought it to a Vietnamese forum VOZ and asked if the experience of Reddit Vietnamese matched what happens in the place Vozer lives, they confirmed it was real. Maybe they joke to me, I don't know. But If people are joking, please stop, I don't know what is joking and what is real. What I see with my own eyes from when I was born to now (being a 25-year-old man) is not something people in Reddit and Voz described.\n I am Vietnamese but people say that I am not Vietnamese, even when I have written in Vietnamese in a local/urban/vulgar style that only Vietnamese use. They just said to me that I use Google, Google Translate, ChatGPT, or AI to pretend I am Vietnamese. It is kind of sad.\n    submitted by    /u/Straight_Random_2211  \n [link]   [comments]",

Trước gia đình mình các cụ ở nhà rảnh rỗi hay xem. Thấy nó quảng cáo bán hàng khá hấp dẫn nên vừa rồi các cụ cũng đặt mua hàng.\n Mặt hàng này là thịt trâu gác bếp (thịt trâu sấy khô). Quảng cáo là để trong tủ đá trữ được 6 tháng. Bán khá đắt (1 triệu vnd / 1kg) nên mình hi vọng chất lượng tốt. \n Không ngờ mua về để tủ đá, mới được hơn 1 tuần thì 1 gói đã mốc trắng như vậy.\n Mình gọi điện đường dây nóng phản ánh với chủ shop thì chủ shop mồm năm miệng mười, nói lấn át cả khách, đổ lỗi cho khách bảo quản.\n Mình để cả 2 gói trong tủ đá, nếu do bảo quản thì cả 2 phải bị chứ. Chưa kể trong tủ đá còn rất nhiều đồ ăn khô không bị làm sao.\n Theo mình suy đoán thì vì bán nhiều hàng nên nó làm láo, trộng hàng cũ vào bán cho khách online. Ai không cẩn thận là ăn phải hàng ôi thiu. \n Mình post lên để mọi người đề phòng với kênh youtube và hội này. Đừng để vừa mất tiền vừa mua tức vào người.\n Long story short, if you don’t know Vietnamese, stay away from SapaTV food, restaurants, and hotel.

Do locals remove it because they think mirrors look uncool? I really don't understand the point in it, even if you don't look in the mirrors, why remove them? I don't recall noticing it anywhere else in southeast Asia. Since then I've noticed maybe 40% or more of the scooters in my area only keep a small left mirror on the bike, especially Vario drivers... I drive a Vario myself and look in the right mirror a lot to keep an eye out for any ninjas creeping up to overtake me on the right side.\n    submitted by    /u/travellingphysics  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was a bit put off because in germany (or west) people marry in a much older age and woman want alot of privacy and freedom. I doubt that that these days girls in VN would want to marry that quick and leave their country, but Im not sure with my lack of knowledge so how is your guys views on this stuff?\n Edit: Thanks for the replies.

Now the questions:\n ​\n  \nIf I dismantle my touring bike (front wheel off) and have it bagged, is it possible to transport it on a bus if I want to \"skip\" a stage (due to bad weather, injury, etc.) - e.g. Quy Nhon -> Kon Tum\n How easy is it to ride out of HCMC towards Vung Tau?\n Away from the coast, is it necessary to book hotels/guesthouses in advance, or can you just show up on the day and realistically expect a room? (my dates don't overlap with Tet). Ideally I'd like to save weight and not have to bring a tent or wild camp.\n I only finalised this trip last week, so probably won't be able to learn/speak much Tieng Viet language, and my tonal pronunciation will probably be wrong. Is this likely to be a big barrier in the rural parts of the Central Highlands?\n Do most hotels/guesthouses/hostels accept card payment?\n For trains (e.g. Hue to Ninh Binh) do tickets (particularly for travellers with bicycles) need to be reserved a day in advance?\n Are there any parts of that itinerary that you reckon should be skipped given that it's January?\n And are there any sights you would really recommend that I've not included? (I've excluded Sapa, Ha Giang and Dien Bien Phu given that presumably it's pretty cold (<10 degrees) at this time of year, and I would guess the earliest days of February in Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay can still be foggy, so I'd leave that for a summer trip, given I only have 28 days).

B, the limitations of these rules and traditions and practices prompt a reaction against them.

          "description": "I looked for some guides on the internet about this, but most of them are from Americans or Europeans, and their dating cultures are so different from each other and from Vietnamese that I don't think I can learn anything from them. So I really need some insight from my fellow people. Here are my questions:\n  \nOutside of online dating, how did you meet your gf and ex? Are most of them previously your friends, your coworkers, someone you were already familiar with? Or just strangers you bumped into?\n When you're interested in a girl, how do you approach her? My understanding is that you'd ask her out for a coffee, a milk tea, right? How successful were you? How often did you get rejected? If rejected, do you just move on and ask the next girl you're interested in, or do you persist and try again later? Are you usually interested in a lot of girls at once, or just focus on one target?\n If she accepts your invitation for a milk tea, how often did it turn into an official relationship? I mean, is dating supposed to be a numbers game where you repeatedly ask a lot of girls out, repeatedly go out with a lot of girls, just to successfully obtain a gf once in a while (let alone a wife)? I see that most people enter a relationship very easily, so it can't be that tedious, right?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/OneMoreChance2007  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are looking for a band who can perform both Vietnamese songs and English rock/alternative/pop music. We are planning a wedding that will combine both Vietnamese and \"Western\" traditions - and, of course, our own wishes and visions. \n We expect around a hundred guests. Most guests will be from Vietnam, but many people from Germany and other nations from around the world will hopefully join. So, it will be wonderful to have people from all over the world to come together, celebrate and connect with one another. We hope a band will be able to play a set before dinner and one afterwards. So, maybe around 3-4 hours in total. Afterwards, we will have a DJ put on some music and we invite the band members to join and celebrate with us. \n If you or someone you know might be interested, please message me! ;) Looking forward to hear from you!\n All best\n Niko\n    submitted by    /u/One-Cup1218  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sorry if this is more suited for the sticky thread, but its quite specific.\n I was adopted from Hanoi in 1992 and I am currently visiting Vietnam and Hanoi.\n I wanted to show the adoption clinic to my children but neither me nor my parents remember the address(we visited the facility in 2008/2009). I am aware that we need permission to enter the facility but we only want to see the outside.\n The only information I have is that the clinic was called \"B clinic\" or \"Clinic B\" back in 1992 and I believe it was still in operation in 2008/2009. However the name can have changed. \n Any information is of value as we leave Hanoi on the 23rd of December and only have tomorrow to find and visit the facility.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/SXJESUS  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry for the rant. But some of the public colleges and primary-high schools in HCM City keep setting back the GODDAMN TIME in which morning classes start. The old time usually was 7:15 or 7:30am, then it back to 7am, and now it become 6:45am (Some schools like HCMC University of Industry and Trade set to as early as 6:30am)\n When asked about this decision, 2 of the most popular answers from the school speaker are: - To avoid heavy traffic --> They seriously thought \"If the traffic is usually jammed at 7am, then why don't we just start the school at 6:45am?\". To me, this is such a dangerous one-sided thinking, which disregard students whose houses are very far from school. Doesn't even mention student now even have less time for breakfast anymore if they wake up at 6 o'clock or later. Plus, people who don't want to deal with heavy traffic are already aware to get up early, you don't need to force everyone has to go more earlier, as long as they go to school before it starts.\n  \nTo prevent student from coming late to class and to encourage them to wake up early--> There is no scientific research stated that the earlier the school start, the lower the student coming to school late. School in US and Europe begin at atleast 8 am so student can have good sleep, which they've done countless researches before. Again, dangerous one-sided thinking to me. As a grad student, I have twice to tripple amount of assignments despite sleeping less comparing to my time in high school. From my experience, it encourages more people to go to class late lol. My friends said this is dumb, and they ended up always going late or only go to second class (8:30 - 10:10am).\n  \nSorry if you find this rant and broken English annoying. I'm 2nd year grad student and I'm tired of waking up in 5am so that I can take buses in 5:40 to get to school in time. The reason I wrote this post so I can relieve some stress from constant complaining against my school. Hope you forgive me.\n    submitted by    /u/Vietcong777  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got the chance to visit Vietnam for the first time in 16 years since I was born last month. I got to experience the city and the wonderful people and I got to go to my orphanage. I got back to the US just 2 weeks ago and I just miss Vietnam so much - part of it just feels like home to me and I just miss the whole vibe and general culture of the country. I have never traveled to a place where I just felt so in place and “normal” with people who were genuinely interested in me and cared about me.

He gets on his phone and coordinates with another driver to take me in their car instead. We stop at a gas station, and I get out with my pet carrier and begin to get into the other car. My driver opens the trunk to retrieve my luggage, closes the trunk lid right away and holds up a 100k bill to show me as he hands it to the new driver. I am in agreement as it seems fine with the exchange of funds to the new driver, and I pay the first driver once my ride completes.\n As I am about to enter the new car, I realize I am missing my large totebag. I tell my original driver, hey I'm missing my other bag. So I go over to the car and he opens the trunk and reaches in and retrieves my totebag. I see the totebag is placed in the trunk in a small, recessed area that just seemed odd. I didn't think much of all this at first, but at the end of the day, this incident has kept me thinking I was trying to be robbed. My totebag contained all my essential items.\n tldr: grabcar drivers says he is sick minutes into a ride, gets me a replacement car and driver and forgets to transfer all my luggage to new car.\n    submitted by    /u/d4rkc4sm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been in vietnam for over 2 weeks now and I've been really depressed about the racism I'm facing here. To give some context, I'm chinese and indian, quite dark skinned, female. \n The counts of racism I've faced here is absolutely disheartening, maybe because of my background, I tend to notice the implicates of it. Other - I've been really well behaved, trying to break the misconceptions about my countrie(s) not because I deliberately want to, but because that's how I am. I'm introverted, am always polite, tip well, do not indulge in the bad stuff. \n  \nAt the hotel I was in, I saw white tourists get upgraded and also an Asian Australian man get upgraded (their original rooms were not available). In my case I was asked to wait 3 hours for my room, when I asked if I could pay for a better room, they happily obliged. This happened on the same day, around the same time. \n \nCustomer service - Specually in hotels again, I saw how other customers were treated over me. Unfortunately, I did notice a theme going around with the skin tone. I saw a couple who came in after me order much more elaborate dishes, it was only after they finished almost eating, was I served my very simple dish. \n \nThe cherry on top, I took a tour to a popular tourist guide with a English speaking tour guide, he went on to speak about how brown skin is not considered beautiful in vietnam, that it's ugly, relates to poor and bad behavior as he himself was brown, he did not have good experiences in vietnam with his love life, job etc.. this really broke my heart. This country is supposed to have the kindest of people, having read the previous threads too, I didn't expect to have this experience in Vietnam of all places. \n \n I just wanted to share this with all the people of colour who keep asking this question if the vietnamese are racist. Here's your answer. Ofcourse, it's not as blatant, or direct, but hurtful nonetheless.\n    submitted by    /u/Pale-Quiet9320  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not like \"conscription\" stuff but, keeps organizing random events and forces students to participate, and if not, deduct bunch of \"diem ren luyen\" or whatever. I just feel like students should have the rights to whether to go or not. Like recently, my university had some sort of Shoppe-sponsored event and of course, to make the sponsors happy, they force every students to attend, standing in the sun for 1 hour then listen to annoying love-related songs about bunch of \"I love you then you dump me\" non-sense. Or forcing students to clean up construction debris in the university. Wow, unpaid working. 10/10, Law university. And upcoming, another sport event that if they didn't threaten to deduct points, probably no one would attend because 90% of the students aren't bothered to wake up at 8AM in Sunday, just to watch bunch of fellow university students playing badmintons and running.\n I understand the morality behind the non-sense of that points system, for \"đánh giá về phẩm chất chính trị, đạo đức, lối sống của sinh viên trên năm mặt đánh giá\" but using this so that the teachers can prove that \"my university organizes events and the students are totally not enforced to come and this will do very well for publicity\" is not really a good excuse to use this points system. Because some university students have their own life to deal with and should not be forced to participate in events that for a lack of better words, they don't give a f- about (there're defo better words). Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Students have their own life and you having free time doesn't mean you should torture the students. \n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/PieNextDoor  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of the items is cash.\n Apparently vietnam customs allow you to bring $5000USD or equivalent foreign currencies in cash without a need to declare. But for their own currency, they only allow travellers to bring in 15million VND which is $620USD equivalent. Anymore than 15million VND in cash has to be declared. That is so weird? Anyone has any experience of bringing in more than 15million dongs in vietnam? Do you actually need to declare? If you did, what did they do? Do they just straight up confiscate the difference?\n Edit: People seem confused so I’ll explain further: \n Guys I am talking about arrivals. Not departure. I’m BRINGING IN 30million dong cash to vietnam to SPEND. I’m NOT BRINGING VND OUT of vietnam. I dont understand why would they limit the bringing of their currency that’s the most legal and accepted to be used in their country so severely. It’s like they are trying to create more business for the money changers there. \n    submitted by    /u/I_knowdude  \n [link]   [comments]",

They will even threaten you! \n Pictures on websites are insanely misleading too and idk why but staff always give off this insanely fake vibe with weird fabricated personas they sport because they they think this somehow pleases tourists? (Spoiler: IT DOES NOT, everything just feels pretty off and not genuine at all).\n All very exhausting.

Nevertheless, I wonder how the Vietnamese state, the society and individual are interested in their Vietnamese cultural heritage. Do people offer it at school like how many western nations may also offer to teach a dead language like latin? Do people use it for modern poems and literature?\n What I personally love about Chinese style characters isn't just the aesthetics, but the connection and meaning that each character holds. They don't just decorate the temples and literature of the past. For example, did you knew that the family name Ngô 吳 does not refer to maize/corn 玉米 , which is also called ngô in Vietnamese? I did not for a long time. I think the usage of Chinese characters can make some differentiation in phonetically same sounding words and its kinda neat.\n I also find concepts and attempts like Quốc âm tân tự and chữ Nôm mới very interesting.\n    submitted by    /u/Thuyue  \n [link]   [comments]",

The toilets are too filthy as they pissed all over it and there is not enough space, it likes you are locked inside a cramped closet with piss filled every fucking corner. The train shaked and as it stopped it almost made me fall into those piss filled corner in the toilet. The noise I could endure but there was a family with little kids who kept kicking the wall during the night. The staff smuggled people so they can charge 10$ per bunk bed while when we officially bought the tickets it was 30$ per seat. As we only bought 2 seats, the 10$ illegal bought beds above us hung their feets right above our head, kicking in the beds so we could not sleep for the whole night. And the train staff, seeing that we realized she smuggled people onto the train and felt we bought our beds so she couldn't make anymore money, treated us as garbage and was being rude the whole ride. I doubt they ever change their attitude or service so I won't ever get on a train in Vietnam for my long ride anymore. It was not worth it.

In China or India, Unilever or P&G would try to match local prices, but in VN they are completely unabashed in price gouging. \n ​\n While I do understand that these would be luxury products for most Vietnamese, this is the first time I've ever seen this lack of price localization almost anywhere in the developing world. \n    submitted by    /u/mycrediblethrowaway  \n [link]   [comments]",

The valleys turn green again, the nightingale captivates with the song. Leave me, leave me, I’m in a hurry to go to the market. I won’t hide it, I love you, but it’s a pity I can’t stay... \"\n The caption goes on to say that the song was created it back in 1957, when the performer participated in a tour of Vietnam as part of a delegation of Soviet art masters. It states that she is wearing the national costume donated to her by the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture.\n I am curious if the song is accurate. Is she really singing in Vietnamese?

Something that I would do with friends mainly and also alone. I’m born European and so know the culture and social codes even in underground spaces.\n So now that I’m on my own here in VN for ths first time ever, I found a bunch of parties I would like to attend, at locations for example: The Observatory, Arcan and The Bar Commune Lab.\n Now all my europe friends are like ‘you should NOT go alone,cause its dangerous to do things alone as a cute female in a third world country’ and in the meanwhile all my friends who are from south east asia themselves, that I met in Europe, are excited for me te explore on my own in VN and make new friends by just showing up here.\n So, what do yall think? Can I go around on my own? Ofcourse a lot of basic female going out things apply like, dont accept drinks from strangers and stuff but idk, I dont feel like Vietnam is that unsafe and these spaces seem experienced when it comes to internationality?\n My viet language is super beginner tho..\n    submitted by    /u/steamed-tofu666  \n [link]   [comments]",

Alone in Europe there is so much cultural differences.\n And then there's the comment sections, turning into what feels like an active war.

But he told me that when he was 17 he needed to go to Vietnam for mandatory military service for a year and that he was a Sergeant-Major. Is this even possible because from what I could find you can only start service in Vietnam when you are between 18-25 and I doubt that becoming a Sergeant-Major is easy.

          "description": "Im planning to write an article related to this topic, hence would like to collect your sharing.\n I observe that social media (especially Facebook watch) is definately creating a negative personality of my parents and other middle aged adults in general. I saw them watch several meaningless and no value contents (in many topics, for example: cancer maker (without any verification), some dudes telling you how to live a life lol) then they share to us with the thought that it’s a reference that we should follow and absorb. It’s hard to say but I feel like the social media is changing the middle-aged people’s mental health. I think because they aren’t growing up with the social media like us (late of Gen Y and on) so they are lacking of “pick and choose tools” when using social media. They are the most vulnerable social media users I think. What u think bout this? Let’s share some thoughts or any practical case?\n    submitted by    /u/Bel-Maniac-0853  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m there for 5 days only to shop, eat and chill. Secondly, My plan is to change 50% of my currency 50% in card.

One of the houses was blasting dance music, we went over and saw the locals are having a birthday.\n For some reason they really, really, really wanted us to join them and we figured why not. So we danced a little and they immediately offered us their booze (don't really know what it was, maybe banana wine?), we drank one glass but they really really wanted us to drink more, at some point we really had to push them off. When we figured we want to leave they grabbed us by the hands (as if to keep on dancing with us) and they where actually holding unreasonable firmly, one might even call it violently. At the end we managed to shake them off and just wave them goodbye.\n It's important to note, the whole settings where very friendly, there where Children, women and elderly in the party, so we don't think those guys had bad intentions and do us harm. We do wonder why they where so keen on having us on their celebration and why the hell where they holding so strongly?\n    submitted by    /u/WranglerTall1006  \n [link]   [comments]",

The motivation behind my inquiry is that many of my wife's friends have experienced divorce, or remarriage, or are seeking partners with more financial stability than their exes. some of their husbands, who happen to be my friends, claim a common issue of feeling controlled. \n In contrast, I have been clear with my wife that either of you is free to walk away without strings attached if the relationship reaches a point of no hope.\n    submitted by    /u/Godfatherisback  \n [link]   [comments]",

Probably a 3-4 year old kid standing on the motorcycle with both his parents sitting in front and behind him, and as always, he wasn't wearing a helmet but the parents were.\n The dad driver did a close maneuever to overtake a public bus but probably forgot about the son standing right behind him. Consequently, the kid's head collided with the side mirror of the bus, causing him to lose balance and fall off the bike. But lucky enough, he fell AWAY from the bus or else it would be a much bloodier scene.\n I don't get this, you can afford a bike, you can afford two helmets each for yourself and your wife, you can afford clothes, you can probably afford a smartphone as well, but a child's helmet crosses the line? Here's an unpopular opinion, if you can't financially & mentally afford a child's helmet, then you probably shouldn't have a child.

          "description": "Hi all,\n First of all, my situation:\n I've been living in HCMC for almost 2 years now but I'm thinking of leaving. My reasons are the high rent, the noise and air pollution, and the traffic.\n Rent here is the highest in Vietnam I think, higher than in Ha Noi I've been told.\n About noise, I tried lots of places and honestly outside of \"luxury\" high rise appartments, other places are affected by noise at night or early morning to the point of being unlivable. I got really depressed once because a place a rented had neighbours arguing all day, karaoke and loud drunk talking at night, funerals,... \n About air pollution, it's worse these days, I can see smog most time I look outside from a high enough floor.\n Traffic is also getting worse. I came to HCMC right at the end of COVID quarantine so it was somewhat normal then, then it got gradually worse. \n Now my question: I'm considering moving to another city, probably Da Nang. Is Da Nang really better in terma of rent, noise, air and traffic? I've been there once and think it's better but it was just a short trip so I'm not sure, heard some stories about karaoke in Da Nang so I want to hear more from everyone.\n    submitted by    /u/assmoede98  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just a small bedroom and bathroom, no living room or anything. \n I wanted to check the electric meter outside my room so I turned off electronics and it wasn’t moving. So far so good. \n I don’t use the fridge , so it’s been off the whole month. Most of my electric usage is for my A/C that runs about 12 hours per day. Otherwise the only other electricity I use is for charging my laptop, or my projector if I’m using it (rarely).\n Electric bill comes in at the end of the month a staggering 1 million vnd! I speak to a neighbor from the house next door. He says he’s paying around 400k for the entire house! \n Now I know the price per KW is 3.000 vnđ, but the landlords make a profit by charging 4.000 vnd. So I’m thinking that either my A/C is super congested and using up a ton of electricity or my landlord is somehow screwing me. \n Any thoughts? I will be talking to him about this issue in 2 days when I pay rent.\n    submitted by    /u/Ill_Ad2468  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mata (Māori) can mean face, but may sometimes refer to eye, eyebrow, or looking out. The Cham word for face is also mata.\n This - này - ne (Cham) - nei (Māori) (usually used as tēnei, but also by itself, like in ā te pō nei (this night).\n There are quite a few more that I found.\n Because of these similarities, could there be more of a Cham influence on Vietnamese than I thought?

I am looking for friends to hang out and eat and go to clubs. New connections that will pull me back to Asia and feel at home. \n Question 1. What would be better than Hanoi for value for money compared to other Asian cities. \n Question 2. Do you find it's easy to make good authentic friendship with travelers and local people?

I have no prior exposure of the language or country whatsoever so I really am clueless about Vietnamese culture. However after doing a little research I found out that people are divided on what the standard dialect of Vietnamese is. Google articles say the standard dialect is Northern Vietnamese but will also tell you that you should learn the Southern dialect instead and materials that teach you the Northern dialect I've noticed are kind of frowned upon. I really have no idea what these mean Which sounds stupid I know but that's why I'll take the time to learn. Does it really matter which dialect I will learn between those two? Are the differences between the two dialects really that noticeable to the point of miscommunication? I also noticed that learning Vietnamese is also not as accessible as learning other languages like Chinese or German so if anyone has/know any free resources to learn Vietnamese then I'd appreciate if you'll share it in the comments...
