My family lived through the worst period in Vietnam history before we left for the U.S. \n A lot of Vietnamese (here on Reddit) hate Vietnamese Americans because we are anti-communist and accuse us as traitors.

I principally lived in France, and I did not learn vietnamese when I was younger, I knew a little from previous trips. I am currently Việt Nam for 3 months by myself (it's been more than 2 months now) and I am speaking a lot better, can hold conversation. Somehow, most of the people here see me as a foreigner. When I approach them (bằng tiếng việt) they stare at me & hit me with the \"tây ạ?\" and ask me why I can speak vietnamese. I have to explain myself pretty much every time to anyone speaking to me, & also not to have the tourist prices haha. Also every time I go to the countryside, everyone stares at me like & talk about me like I don't understand them lol.\n ​\n It hurts me as I always considered myself vietnamese, as I lived with my việt kiều mom most of my life and growing up w vietnamese culture, I feel very vietnamese to put it simple haha. It starts to make me feel a bit sad, & even sometimes I feel wrong not to look viet enough & don't feel like I belong to this community. Everybody in France can tell I am asian from my features, but here I am a foreigner to them.\n ​\n Do you have any tips on how to approach this situation? Does anybody have been through the same experience? I think it would make me feel better to know that I am not alone in this. \n ​\n Cảm ơn mngười! :)\n    submitted by    /u/ljmsn  \n [link]   [comments]",

For me, even though I was born in Vietnam and currently live in the US (my parents still live in Vietnam however), I am not thinking of getting a Vinfast as there are many EVs which offer better value for the money, in my opinion (like Hyundai Ioniq 5, where there is a better brand cachet).\n    submitted by    /u/ToyotaCamryRAV4  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently started travelling to Vietnam for work, spending weeks at a time there (4 trips this year already, 82 days in country total - just since August). I brought my 66i and I've been doing hikes with some of the locals on the weekends. It's been amazing. However, I've come to find that my Garmin has almost no detail about any of the areas I hike in. No trails, no contour, no roads. Many times it is blank. It's fine for tracking where I go, should I need to find my way out, but it's a pain to try and plan or navigate some of our hikes when I can't really see what is out there.\n I checked Garmin's website and there's no maps to purchase. There seems to be third parties selling SE-Asia maps but I can't really get a read on how trustworthy they are.\n Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations? I'm heading back out in a few weeks for a 6 week trip, one week of which we'll be going deep into the woods in northern Vietnam for 4 nights 5 days hiking and exploring caves. I'd like to have my garmin properly giving me information.\n    submitted by    /u/OldManKiK  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are the local people of Vietnam keen on hanging out for NYE celebrations? Or is the lunar new year more popular of a holiday in VN?\n Also, what are some good ways to meet people and learn about the people and culture in VN? From what I've read, if you look like a foreigner (I am 190cm white guy from America lol) people will talk to you if they see you eating by yourself and are generally quite friendly. Is this true? I'd love to meet people and feel warm and welcome, unlike when I went to Australia and it felt almost the same as America--super lonely and hard to meet people.\n    submitted by    /u/Pollo_Perpetuo  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I have been denied by Hanoi immigration due to a 'immigration violation'. \n I still do not know exactly what the problem is and how to fix it! I am more than happy to pay a fine. I have tried many times to call and email Hanoi immigration but still no reply. I even visited Vietnam embassy in Thailand and London but they couldn't help. \n Is there anyone that can help me or give me a contact with someone that works in VN immigration so I can speak to them directly and fix this problem. \n I have wasted a lot of money and time on agents who take my money under many promises but then do not help at all!\n I am a British citizen and currently living in London.

I want to get a suit and I hear Ho Chi Minh is the place to do it, As I fly out of Ho Chi Minh on the 6th of December, I figure my best shot is to get fitted and order it as soon as I arrive tomorrow.\n Can anyone give me any tips or recommendations on places to get it done?!

We live in Vietnam. I normally drive an electric motorbike and don't have a motorbike license. I have a TRC. I've learned that one of the leading motorbike rental shops (QT Motorbikes) will rent a motorbike to me, but they require that I leave my passport with them. I don't like doing that. (Also, I might need my passport at a hotel or if the police stop us.) I'm looking for recommendations for a motorbike rental in Ha Giang that will rent a semi-automatic bike to me for two days without requiring my passport as a deposit. Thanks\n Edit: Would welcome hotel recommendations in Ha Giang and places to see within a few hours' motorbike ride, too.\n    submitted by    /u/RanyDaze2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Tried to find some data online and struggled to find what I was looking for. Perhaps because the resource may be in Vietnamese?\n I’m curious about the wealth distribution by age in Vietnam. Been in Vietnam for a few weeks now. I’ve noticed a lot of people in their late 20s/30s wear nicer/designer clothes and tend to have fancier bikes than those older than 40. Although, I also know people that are younger may tend to care about these visual indicators of wealth more.\n Vietnam is a rapidly modernizing country, so I’d assume people born in the late 80s/90s have had better career opportunity? Curious about people’s perspective here. Assuming that the fallouts of the wars with America and China took some time to economically recover from.\n    submitted by    /u/GU3MS  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "First time I booked them. Actually booked AA but the carrier was JAL. I thought JAL had a decent reputation.\n Other than some super efficient and sweet stewardesses this was not a good experience. \n  \nTried to upgrade to an emergency aisle seat for 100$. At first the very nice Caucasian worker said ok. But after checking with the Japanese JAL rep they said no. Only Japanese citizens can book it. Huh????? Can you imagine if AA said only Americans can book certain seats?\n \nInflight entertainment really blew. The movie selection was like a scarce selection of movies one might find at a rummage sale. They did have one James Bond movie. I ended up watching that and Shawshank Redemption for the umpteenth time. The hardware interface had such lag you never knew if a button press actually worked. Had to restart a few times. I know it's a lot to ask but nowadays a selection of podcasts is pretty common. Also, and this is in general, why can't airlines offer live newsfeeds? JAL had a day old BBC International segment and one Japanese language news segment.\n \nI sat economy. The seat was particularly torturous even for economy. It was hard and small. I spent the last 6 hours of the flight rotating my position trying to find new unused parts of my ass that would give me ten minutes of relief. I'm a medium size guy.\n \nThe food was typical airline food in this case limited to Japanese cuisine That was ok by me but I thought I'd mention it. I had two legs on this flight: BOS to NRT (14 hrs) and NRT to SGN,( 6 hrs).Both flights had the exact same menu. I just skipped meal service completely on the second flight. \n \n Maybe my experience was a one-off. Anyone want to share?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/AVelvetTip  \n [link]   [comments]",

My partner has been driving all over southeast Asia with me on the back for the past several months with no issues. However, we've only ever driven an automatic and we're a bit nervous as I saw a couple posts on here that said a semi automatic or manual was needed to do the loop. We messaged the scooter rental we rented from before when we did the Hai Van pass to ask them about the loop and they told us it was safe to do the loop on a 125cc automatic scooter with two people on it. We wanted something a bit bigger if we could do it on an automatic but they don't have anything over 125cc.\n Just wondering from people who have done it recently, especially with all the construction I've read about, if they felt that would be adequate. If not, maybe we might get a lesson on the semi automatic when we get to Ha Giang and see how comfortable we feel on it before deciding what to do? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/allycatsimba  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have my European motorcycle license, so I'm fairly confident on the bike.\n I've always wanted to do a tour between Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, mainly riding through the mainland. However, after doing some research I get a lot of sources saying the north of Hanoi is the place to be.\n On one hand I'd love to get as much a vibe of Vietnam as possible, which seems the Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi would provide best. On the other hands, if the best sites are in the north, then I can totally be convinced to go there.\n Is there anyone who could give me some advice on this?\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/a_guy_named_rick  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, apologies for using English and the google translation below. \n ​\n I LOVE FOOD!!! One of the most exciting parts of coming to Vietnam for me is learning about the culture and food that Vietnamese people are so beautifully famous for. \n ​\n My problem(?) is that I have had gastric sleeve surgery so I can't eat much. Generally in Australia, my husband and I order one meal to share, but if I want something he can't eat or doesn't like, I will order my own meal and take the leftovers home to reheat later. That's going to be a little hard when I'm trying to eat as many different type of Vietnamese food as possible.\n ​\n Would it be offensive or \"bad\" for me to order a whole meal for myself and leave a lot of leftovers? I'd love for us to order 2 different Pho's and get to experience both but would it be a bad thing if we didn't eat it all? \n Any tips on how to explain/apologise for my limited eating capacity will be well received!!!! PLEASE! \n Google translate below:\n Xin chào tất cả, xin lỗi vì sử dụng tiếng Anh và bản dịch google bên dưới.\n ​\n TÔI YÊU THỰC PHẨM!!! Một trong những phần thú vị nhất khi đến Việt Nam đối với tôi là tìm hiểu về văn hóa và ẩm thực mà người Việt Nam vốn nổi tiếng xinh đẹp.\n ​\n Vấn đề của tôi (?) là tôi đã phẫu thuật dạ dày nên tôi không thể ăn nhiều. Thông thường ở Úc, vợ chồng tôi gọi một suất ăn để chia nhau, nhưng nếu tôi muốn món gì mà anh ấy không ăn được hoặc không thích, tôi sẽ gọi suất ăn của mình và mang phần thừa về nhà hâm nóng lại sau. Điều đó sẽ hơi khó khăn khi tôi cố gắng ăn càng nhiều loại thức ăn Việt Nam càng tốt.\n ​\n Gọi nguyên một suất ăn cho mình mà để lại nhiều thức ăn thừa thì có phản cảm hay “xấu” không? Tôi rất muốn chúng ta gọi 2 phở khác nhau và được trải nghiệm cả hai nhưng không ăn hết có phải là một điều tồi tệ không?\n Mọi lời khuyên về cách giải thích/xin lỗi về khả năng ăn uống hạn chế của tôi sẽ được đón nhận!!!!

This happens when I speak english to them. I say thank you when I hear them, cause tbh Vietnamese women are beautiful & also didn’t know what to say in response. \n Honestly, I’m not sure if I’m thinking too much into it but just wanted to know what it means? \n I’m not Vietnamese (obviously lolol), just a traveler from another SEA country.\n Edit to add: I’m a female & motorcyclists stare at me while driving past. not sure if they’re just being creeps\n    submitted by    /u/bongtheduck  \n [link]   [comments]",

We've been following the advice of only using Mai Linh / Vinasun or just walking, but a man at the rank queue guided us to a Saigon Tourist taxi at the queue. I thought he was the official taxi rank guide, but looking back obviously he was a partner / part of this particular taxi company.\n Taxi driver was chatty and had fairly good English, asking us about our home country.\n First issue was the exit toll - didn't realise there was one - he said we had to pay it, pointing to a sign on his sun visor. I asked how much and he wouldn't properly say, then as I looked in my wallet he reached over and grabbed it, went through the notes saying there were lots of big ones, and pulled one out. I really thought it was a 100k bill (but can't be sure) …",

I'm little bit concerned about Typhoons as in my home country we do not have anything relatively extreme. I read on news that Da Nang experienced Typhoon Noru - saw the videos, images and heard that there was an evacuation in thousands, so got scared a bit and thinking - maybe just go back to EU and sip beers there without worrying too much, haha. \n I do plan to stay there for a month or two as DN. Anyone who have been there and can give any pro-tips about that place, please let me know down below. \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/MaartinBlack1996  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, we read Da Nang is #3 hot spots in SeA. Based on these findings and recommendations, we booked ourself a good amount of time here.\n After spending 5 days in HCMC - which we really enjoyed - the experiences here in Da Nang didn’t really meet our expectations. We’re staying in the beach area, went to the city center, did Hai Van Pass & Ba Na Hills.\n We’re very curious about the history of this city. It feels like there’s put a lot of money into it years ago, but not very well maintained. Also they’re still building A LOT, while other properties seem unfinished.\n Is this city build to be Asias Dubai/Barcelona/Rio/Miami (since it has a beach)?\n We’re also looking for recommendations on what to do/see/eat here :)\n    submitted by    /u/edvrslit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sau một thời gian nói chuyện với tụi nó thì rút ra kết luận là kĩ năng nghe nói của mình quá kém T^T, nhất là khi nói chuyện với đứa UK và Úc. Không chỉ accent khác mà cách tụi nó đặt câu cũng khác quắc. Thí dụ khi gặp nhau UK hay hỏi \"Have you done much today?\" Lúc đầu mình nghe hổng ra cứ phải nghệt mặt ra hỏi lại, giờ nghe quen thì chỉ cần nó nói much là bắt bài được liền =)) nhưng vẫn là nghe được 50% của nó thôi không nghe ra được hết. Mình để ý cách tụi nó đặt câu hỏi và trả lời, và với cách mình được học cũng khác nữa, nhiều khi mình hỏi mà tụi nó không hiểu, nên thành ra ông gà bà vịt :))) để luyện tập thêm thì bên cạnh nói nhiều với tụi nó thì mình cũng coi show, program và để ý các nhân vật đối thoại rồi nhại theo, chứ cũng không biết còn cách nào khác không. Đặc biệt là nhiều khi muốn join conversation của tụi nó mà ko được cứ thấy vấp váp kiểu gì. Nói được 1 2 câu là ngưng nhảy số rồi. Mình muốn hỏi các bạn đã luyện kĩ năng nghe nói như nào vậy? Mình có tìm hiểu thì biết phải luyện theo intonation, schwa, diction. Các bạn luyện theo những phương pháp này thấy ổn hông? speaking của mình lúc trước cũng ko tệ lắm, 7.0 nhưng thấy cũng còn loay hoay quá. Hoan nghênh mọi ý kiến đóng góp. Any advice would help!

The only movie on Netflix they had was Dreamy Eyes (Mất Biếc) which was a pretty good love story, but not a comedy.\n In no way am I making an assumption based on the tiny sample size of the shows available on Netflix, but is comedy less popular in Vietnam as a form of entertainment?

My itinerary was roughly 4 days in tp HCM, 10 days up North in various places, then another 7 days back in HCM.\n I found that Hanoi was really active. Full of tourists, full of fun things happening. And most importantly, hotel accommodation was reasonably priced. Managed to get a good sized room with a balcony, at a good hotel, for around 650.000 in Hoàn Kiếm area, not five minutes walk from the lake. \n By comparison, on my second stay in Saigon, best I could get was a passable room in a really cramped hotel with paper thin walls, for about 1000.000/n. I did scour Agoda and Booking.com for better deals, but there weren't many to be found. \n And this despite there being very few tourists there (for some reason). That being the case, you'd think supply would exceed demand, and you'd get hotels dropping their prices in order to compete. \n Another example: In my first 4 day stint in Saigon, I got a nice room with a balcony, in a nice but slightly run down hotel on Để Thám, for around 835.000. I would have booked them for my second stay too, but for some reason, they decided to double the price after I left. \n I'm not whining. Just really puzzled by the economics of this.\n    submitted by    /u/DefamedPrawn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just can’t shake off the feeling that I’m being exposed to the dioxin. Even though it’s 50yrs ago, it’s not like dioxin has an expiration date.\n If it’s still in the soil, how does it NOT affect the (tap) water, fruits, plants and animals? For example: if tap water comes from rain, the rain first goes through the infected soil and is pretty much untreated (doesn’t really smell like chlorine). People here also say it’s safe to drink boiled tap water and I guess they make pho’s and coffee with it. But how about heavy metals like lead?\n We’re flying to Danang today and just the feeling of walking around that airport where that stuff was at 50yrs ago stresses me out.\n Am I overthinking it or is my stress legit?\n I feel so bad for the locals that this happened.\n    submitted by    /u/fliefloeflah  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm so excited and have so many questions, but first, I want to ask about this topic which I have seen come up quite often when doing my research about Vietnam.\n Somebody posted an article here a few days ago about culture shocks when traveling to Vietnam, and one of the first things on the list mentioned that it's common to see men publicly physically assault their wives.\n I have been doing a lot of research about Vietnam, and while I love almost every other aspect about it, this topic has arisen so many times that I feel the need to ask you people who live there and have been there before. So many articles mention that you will see men hit their wives and as long as you don't interfere, you will be fine, etc. This really concerns me because of some instances of seeing this in my childhood that really bothered me, so I am really worried about seeing this in Vietnam.\n How common is it really? I plan to travel to the major cities like Hanoi and HCMC. Is it actually a super common thing to hear and see domestic violence? It really makes me anxious thinking about having to see and hear this and not be able to help. \n I guess I get triggered when I hear or see domestic violence and am wondering if it's something that I am likely to be forced to witness on a regular basis in Vietnam.\n    submitted by    /u/Pollo_Perpetuo  \n [link]   [comments]",

There probably isn’t an airport in Ninh Binh so I might have to go back to Hanoi if flying is the best option.\n Hue to Nha Trang is also 11 hours by car, so maybe plane or sleeper bus again. I was considering doing the Hi Van Pass maybe from hue to Da Nang, if it would be easier to get from Da Nang to Nha Trang.\n Nha Trang to Phan Thiet by car is 4 hours, so idk about that one.\n HCMC to Phan Thiet is also 4 hours.\n If anyone has done a similar route before, please share how you traveled between these places and any other tips\n Also, if you have any other recommendations for places near the ones I have mentioned, or if you recommend skipping a city feel free to share:)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/unjverse  \n [link]   [comments]",

The food, the art, the culture, and the seemingly endless ebb and flow of motorbikes in and around the major cities. What always sticks out the most is the absolute tenacity of Vietnams people. They are \"get it done\" type people, which I have the utmost respect for. Vietnam has some of the most stunning landscapes you can witness from the northern Ha Giang mountains to southern mighty Mekong. Partnered by ever changing food dishes curated by the different distinct cultures. This place is somewhere I long to call home one day. Thank you for everything, and until next time.\n    submitted by    /u/tainted_alloy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe that artists should convey their music in any way in which they feel the most comfortable. But the idea of having Vietnamese artists that mostly sing in English or have an English stage name is so frowned upon in Vietnam and many would be called \"sính ngoại\" or \"anglocentric\".

I’m looking for a real escape with some chilled time to heal physically, mentally and spiritually. I’ve had a tough few years for various reasons, one of them being my health. I have a problem digesting food due to an issue with my pancreas. Thus I need to eat mainly low fat, healthy food.\n Here comes my questions:- 1. Vietnamese food seems super healthy, and especially so in North Vietnam, where I read the diet is more simple. Would you agree? Cooking with too much oil is a killer for me, deep fried is a definite no and I generally avoid red meat.\n  \nI will have to bring medication with me (enzymes) as I need these when I eat. Has anyone been able to bring a prescription from abroad and use it in Vietnam? I live in Netherlands, Europe btw. I’d like to be organized with this in case I want to stay on longer. I have 6 months off from January.\n \nI’d like to do some kind of agri tourism while there, perhaps where food is grown and to be a part of this. I’d love to learn more about growing grains and plants, and it would be nice to involve with a community.\n \nStaying fit is super important to me, so I’d love to join a gym over there for a month, is this easy? My gut is telling me Hanoi is a good place for me to be for a while. Also I love to bike, is it common to cycle around Vietnam?\n \n Thanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/CheeryMoose  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can send and receive SMS messages with locals through the app.\n When I connect with people here and give out my number (American) if they're iOS it is fine since we can iMessage. But most are not iOS therefore they are hesitant to text (or some can't) because of the international number.\n I know there are alternative apps like WhatsApp and such.

I'd like to leave the USA in february to dodge part of the winter and go back to Viet to ride the loop. I remember that Hanoi was quite cold and rainy when I was there in January and I'd prefer to ride the loop when weather conditions are optimal. Is February too early to ride Ha Giang Loop? I can wait until early march if I must but going early february is preferred if conditions are similar. I am getting conflicting information as a I read articles about it. \n Btw I am experienced with riding a motorbike in viet countryside and am aware of issues with trucks and busses. Im guessing that I wont have problems with riding Ha Giang. I was thinking of a Honda Wave semi-Auto. It was reliable last time I did a trip around Vietnam and Im not practiced on manuals. Like many others, I am not going to be riding this legally. Im aware of the risks but just like last time I went to Vietnam, I gotta do what I gotta do.\n    submitted by    /u/samhandwich22  \n [link]   [comments]",

We fly into HCM and plan on travelling the Deep South - Mekong Delta onto Phu Quoc.\n We have estimated on spending 20-30 days in this region and are wondering if this may be too long? We are also considering exploring the delta on motorbikes (is this worth while for the time spent there?).If so would anyone have experience or routes biking the delta/south. We mainly found 1/2 day trips online about the delta, and haven’t found much on longer self planned stays.\n As far the places entail (suggestions welcome!)\n  \nMy Tho\n \nBen Tre\n \nTra Vinh\n \nVinh Long\n \nCan Tho\n \nSa Dec\n \nCao Lanh\n \nLong Xuyen\n \nChau Doc\n \nHa Tien\n \nPhu Quoc\n \n Any advice would be hugely appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/yoguy88  \n [link]   [comments]",

Originally planned to be a 350kph/220mph-ish line, the 2022 version calls for a designed speed of 250kph/155mph and an operating speed of 180-225kph, or 111-140mph. The construction will take place from 2025 to 2041 in three phases, a nine-year reduction compared to the original plan. It will utilize electric multiple units as the rolling stock, with both passenger and freight versions running on double-track standard gauge (1435mm) rail, as opposed to the existing narrow gauge (1067mm). \n The line will be 1508km/937mi long, consisting of ~70 stations. The annual estimated figures for passenger and freight is 163M and 65M metric tons, respectively, with 142 pairs of passenger and 128 pairs of freight train running daily. The first phase (2025-2031) will comprise of a 361km/224mi line connecting Thu Thiem (HCM City) to Nha Trang. Following this, a line from Hanoi to Da Nang will be constructed from 2031 to 2038. The final phase (2038-2041) will involve connecting Nha Trang and Da Nang. Roughly $61.7B will be spent, with the majority (63%) coming from land acquisitions and auctions. 22% will come from state-funded sources, with private funding expected to be about 15% of the total budget.\n    submitted by    /u/Professional_Spray14  \n [link]   [comments]",

He played around for a bit and ‘teethed’ (place his teeth on but not bite) my hand. He also lightly scratched me (left a mark for 5 minutes before disappearing). Does anyone know if there is rabies on Cat Ba Island? And also does anyone know if the situation I described is enough to transmit rabies? I’m currently heading to Ha Giang so will be away from any vaccination clinic. But it is now a massive worry, as I thought Rabies is evident with aggressive or erratic behaviour.\n    submitted by    /u/Super-Slice-1550  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I speculated an alternate lore (short) where North Vietnam instantly invaded (or special military campaign\" in Laos to weaken the Western-dominated \"American\" alliance influence in Southeast Asia. Had Pathet Laos toppled the corrupted Vientiane government either in 1963 or 1964, then South Vietnam faced a peril where the newly communist Laos government planned to infiltrate Central Vietnam (South Vietnam) to prevent largely American forces gained on foothold across Central Highlands.\n Another POD is both Vietnams divided at the 16th Parallel (leaving Da Nang and southern branch of Thu Bon River under North Vietnam side). It would create massive chaos in Laos where communist North Vietnam easily determined to aid Pathet Laos to \"liberate\" Vientiane around early 1964 or 1965 (or even before 1968 Tet Offensive) depending on American military moodiness. North Vietnamese General Giap would like to see the size of NVA forces to orchestrate the moderately launched assaults of several Laotian towns and villages near the Vietnam-Laos border.\n With Laos under a \"socialist\" Vietnamese client state (regardless if Vietnam divided in 17th Parallel as per OTL or alternatively divided at 16th parallel), South Vietnam could faced intensified harassment from largely local \"VC\" communist forces near the South Vietnam-Laos border and even near provincial capitals in Central Highlands. This would lead the American government to seek peace talks with North Vietnam and Soviet Union secretly in a third country. If successful peace talks in mid-1960s, American could be saved up to 30,000 American soldiers and even save largely funds to fight against poverty in the domestic U.S. I generalized a possibly no Nixon as President of U.S in 1969.\n Can you think about ideas that devastated South Vietnam?\n    submitted by    /u/Thick_Broker6931  \n [link]   [comments]",

I love Southeast Asia and want to stay, but Saigon has ridiculous real estate pricing and interest rates on house loans. Also, crazy pricing for international schools, crazy traffic etc. So I've done some research and see many foreigners who moved to Malaysia and they seem to really love it. KL/Penang seem very developed with good public transportation, great real estate pricing even for luxury places, good mortgage rates, good tax situation for digital nomads, and international schools are cheap. Overall it seems like a clear upgrade over many aspects of Saigon (don't hate me for saying this, I honestly don't know, just read online).\n For some reason though my wife is not down with this idea. She doesn't like Malaysia and the culture there. I'm wondering what other Vietnamese people think of Malaysia and Malaysian culture?

          "description": "In the current debate surrounding Affirmative Action, many people evoke \"the poor Vietnamese who are uneducated and therefore need affirmative action\". First off, most schools don't consider the difference between South East Asians and East Asians. Secondly, statistics paint a different picture. Look at this table from Pew Research:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pik9p1w0h0y91.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=87eee2b83401f3d4349b212c79251d00db52dc14\n As you can see, Vietnamese born abroad, that is, the refugees, have low educational attainment. But for the generation that was born here, educational attainment is higher than whites. This, of course, contradicts the liberal narrative that Asians are doing better because of higher socio-economic status. Yes, they are correct -- many Vietnamese came to the US poor and without much education. But their children perform better than white Americans.\n The same story is told with income:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pocewmi4h0y91.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=4830d089be09f22dccae7fe3c065106b16ddc751\n So, pro-affirmative action advocates, stop using the Vietnamese as your token Asian minority to disguise your Asian racism.

          "description": "I've been reading about different tribes around the world. Long ago (10-15 years?) I came across something online that said Vietnam has 52 tribes, and that most are in north Vietnam. That seems like A LOT for such a small place. I can google and find stuff on my own but I'm asking just in case someone might know some great material that I can read. It can be in Vietnamese. I can use Google Translate to translate the text. Thank you!\n I love this food YT channel based in Vietnam for going to visit the tribes around the world. This one is in Vietnam but I didn't catch which tribe it is. https://youtu.be/81aLMRK1ris\n These are all the tribes around the world that they visited.

I’m visiting for the first time in nearly five years next year and I want to work on my Vietnamese. I learned a small amount from my mom growing up (she worked long hours and did not have much free time) but I otherwise grew up isolated from other Vietnamese people. I’ve tried a few app/services and I’m currently using Duolingo. I am aware, however, of how specific the Hue dialect is, and I’m worried that I’m learning bad habits and potentially making myself even more unintelligible to my relatives. Does anyone know of any services that specifically teach the Hue dialect?

However, Vietjet decided to change my flight for 10AM of the same day. First of all, I had never seen any airline bring forward a flight before. Secondly, they refused to refund me the entire amount, and the only solution offered was a \"creditshell\", which is a credit I can use for future flights with them. Now that I'm back from vacations and can afford to lose some time with this, I wanted to ask if anyone had any success obtaining a full refund from them for a similar situation, or if this is a lost cause and I should just forget about the 70$ I paid.

Now I’ve read a lot of writings where it is pointed out that MSG/bột ngọt aversion is originated from a 1968 racist research in USA. For me that explains why the western world is on the err side when it comes to MSG. \n Still I don’t really know why a lot of Vietnamese, my parents, people of their age, my age, and younger (Gen Z) is still very skeptical with MSG. They:\n  \n Makes an effort to avoid eateries/restaurants that they perceive to be using too much MSG\n  Claims that they’re nauseous or having headaches when consuming too much or any MSG at all\n  Avoid using MSG in their cooking\n  \nI do find 2-3 to be quite funny because Vietnamese are still using a lot of stock powder/bột nêm which is basically flavored MSG. \n Is there any knowledge for where this MSG aversion in Vietnam originates? Is it because of the 1968 study that carries to Vietnam during the war and persists thereafter? Do you experience 1 and 2 yourself? I do want to listen to you guys.\n Do you think MSG induced sickness is placebo effect?\n    submitted by    /u/neinherz  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's super lovely and the people are really nice, some of the cutest super lovely people I've met. But I can't walk down the street without people on their scooters stopping asking me for a ride, people selling glasses, chips, paintings, bracelets, necklaces, tours and private car tours. I get people have to make a living. Which is totally understandable. It's probably more a culture shock to me than anything. I can't walk down the beach without being asked by people every 40 meters I walk if I want to buy their things and knickknacks. It's gotten to a point where I'm starting to feel rude to these people.\n But they also can't take no for an answer and are really really pushy and persistent.
