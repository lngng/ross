          "description": "Hi everyone, \n 8 days ago, I began catching online predators in Vietnam. I have 3 catches already. Yesterday, I caught my first teacher. That didn't take long. This guy was an English Teacher at an international school here in Vietnam. \n He was immediately fired from his school, his apartment was contacted and they notified police immediately. He is losing his work permit. His embassy is aware of the situation. \n It is very scary to think there are teachers out there trying to meet up with kids for pleasures. Thankfully, he met me instead of a kid and I reported ALL INFORMATION to proper authorities. \n You can watch the catch on YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I will continue to do my part to protect the community and children in Vietnam. \n I know some of you were skeptical about my original post when I said I was going to do this. 3 catches in 8 days is the results so far. Again, all evidence against each predator is always submitted to local authorities, employers, family members, embassies and whomever else may need it. That is all I can do on my end. \n Much love to all of you! Thanks for your time. Will continue to update the community when new catches come out as you may know this person. Share, share, share and make others aware of these guys.\n    submitted by    /u/SaigonSterling  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do we bring cash and try to exchange it instead? What is the best move? \n As i understand, she will be able to open a bank account there once she has her work visa done. With that said, we will have substantial spending for first month and she won't get paid until the end of the month (finding apartment, 2 months deposit plus first months rent, food, necessities etc). I am thinking we need to bring enough USD cash with us otherwise we will get destroyed with foreign exchange fees? I also read there are limits on daily withdrawals? Is it feasible to bring USD and exchange it at gold shops? Is there a limit how much they will exchange?

I had learned through online resources the way you hi to people is “Xin chào” for formal and just “chào” for informal. I took Spanish the last two years of school and had learned to use “usted” to say “you” formally to people older than you or to higher-ups, so I assumed I would use “Xin chào” to greet my family. When my dad picks me up from school, I began to greet him with “Xin chào,” but recently he told me I would actually say “Con chào ba” to greet him or anyone else (pronouns changing depending on person). I was curious if that was a regional thing (my dad is from south vietnam but my bà nội is from north vietnam/south china) or if that’s a general thing among all vietnamese people?\n    submitted by    /u/LittleStar385  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can buy food, deal with money, understand classroom commands etc. Obviously, I'm a teacher. I also generally can understand what topic people are talking about, but not what they're saying, if that makes sense.\n My issue with Duolingo is that I like knowing what I'm learning, not just guessing. As in, I'd like to know the grammar rules and stuff. I know not everyone learns that way, but I quite like to learn theoretically! This will be my fourth language to learn, so I feel like I have an idea of how I best learn. (I am not fluent in my third, but have learnt enough to get by in simple situations, which is kind of what I'm aiming for here).\n I am thinking of asking one of the Vietnamese teachers I work with for a lesson once a week but my schedule doesn't allow time for much more. Self study would be ideal for me, especially reading, grammar and vocab. I have lots of short pockets of time to kill between lessons. I have a handle on most of the tones, but that's what I would focus on with an in person teacher (tones, pronunciation etc).\n Any resources to recommend?

I also feel that most tours and guides around the world play it very safe and conduct their tours in the most uncontroversial or unchallenging ways possible, which can be problematic for someone who wants to hear about a problematic or contested period of history. I've even been on a few tours in Central Europe (ahem Hungary) that went far the other way with very conservative nationalistic and revisionist recollections of historical moments, but I feel it's difficult to find guides or tours with a collectivist mentality.\n Does anyone have any tours or guides they can recommend to me for January? Or am I thinking too hard about this, and maybe the average Vietnamese guide does feel this way and want to share about their country through this lens? I just don't want a guide that gives me a Wikipedia summary of Saigon's political/social history because they think it's what I want to hear.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/Curiotravels  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am curious how popular it is for girls to dye their hair in Vietnam and if the elders were to complain if the girls dye their hair brown, blonde, red, blue, pink, etc?\n In my family (all Vietnamese, living in the US), my 85 year old uncle (aunt's husband) really hates hair dye to the point where if one of his family members dye their hair (ex. my cousin), he would yell at them. My cousin dyed her hair blonde and she ended up being scorned by him. He told her \"you look very ugly with the hair dye. Please un-dye the hair\".\n His daughter had cancer and had to undergo chemo and because she lost her hair, she decided to buy a wig. I think she went with the black hair wig because if she went with blonde, her father would disown her.\n Also, for some of my cousins (part of the uncle and aunt's side), they brainwash their children not to dye their hair. They say that not only does hair dye look ugly (even brown or blonde hair because one part is light and the other is dark), it causes cancer as well. According to them, if their children dye their hair, they will get grounded (maybe even spanked) and they might get disowned by the family because they are seen as 'rebellious'.\n I definitely don't view that way and I view hair dye as a person's identity and personality.\n  \n [link]   [comments]",

Therefore, I’ve started looking for a job in Hanoi but my visa is about to expire. \n During one of my interviews, an employer told me that I had to do a visa run because I don’t have a work permit. Is this correct or are there any ways that the employer may not know about? If it is correct, what is the cheapest way to do a visa run? I’ve done research about it and found some information but if there is anyone here who knows about this stuff or has had a personal experience like this, I would like to hear from them cause I’m in a dire situation.

I get nothing from this except I just want to support her. \n She makes custom lessons depending on what you want to learn and you’re learning style. She’s an actual teacher in Vietnam but luckily she teaches Vietnamese to foreigners (or viet kieu) with more of a western style … if you know what I mean 😂\n I think she charges about 14-16 dollars per hour. \n Please send me a message for her contact info.

Looking to avoid crowds and traffic where possible so my image is that (for example) a trail run or a loop around a big park/lake would be ideal. \n Open to tips on hydration and prep as well (including some food that's gonna go down well as I'm not a massive fan of Vietnamese cuisine outside ban xeo, a simple pho (no 'special' ingredients), banh hoi and fresh fruit/veg. \n I've never run in Vietnam but I've run during Japanese summers and am picturing something pretty similar in terms of humidity (i.e. I had to do shorter distances at slower speeds otherwise I'd get exhausted/dehydrated really quickly).

I'm not really interested in European/western flavors or designs or characters, I hope to find something generally like this. \n I can't speak Vietnamese so phone communication might be difficult, but of you know any such bakeries with an email address, I can surely translate a request and send it on to them. Thanks for any recommendations you may have!\n Edit: I did see that someone wrote bakeries like Givral may have something like this, but I didn't see options on their website so I wonder if such cakes just aren't posted online?\n    submitted by    /u/spargelzeitgeist  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or are the waters so still that boats are barely rocking? \n \nSecondly, we are trying to decide between Ha Long Bay or Lan Ha Bay. Which would you recommend for a first timer? Seems like Ha Long Bay is a little more spectacular and can walk inside caves but super duper touristy, Lan Ha Bay slightly less touristy but a little less grand? Or is it just worth it to go to both?\n \nIs it worth it to stay on Cat Ba? It seems like we'd have a slightly less hectic experience if we spent a couple of days on Cat Ba and did some hiking or kayaking, is it worth going to? \n \nIs there easy to access and regular public transport from the North of Cat Ba where the ferry drops off to the South where hotels are? Apparently there are buses and taxis bit not sure how easy they are to get or how regular.\n \n Thanks for any help! :)\n    submitted by    /u/anna_b_1  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems like there is no consensus on Hoi An, some people say it should only be a day trip and other people wish they had spent more time there. I have a mid-budget and care most about trying great food, having unique accommodations, beautiful scenery, and being able to go on cool day tours. I'm not interested in shopping so Hoi An does not sound very appealing. I fly out of Da Nang which is why I thought it would make sense to stay there and make a day trip to Hoi An. It also seems like similar tours are offered from each location. \n My rough itinerary is as follows: Hanoi - 2 nights; Ha Long Bay - 2D/1night then bus to Ninh Binh - 1 night, overnight bus to Phong Nha - 4 nights then train to Hue - 1 night; then easy rider to Da Nang/Hoi An - 2 nights.\n    submitted by    /u/AmaleekYoaz  \n [link]   [comments]",

I grew up in a great family in the states, but I’ve always wanted to go find my biological family. Right before COVID I traveled to Vietnam for 30 days to try and find my family. I found them after a few days and lived with them for the remainder of my time there and I’ve gotten very close to them these past couple years.\n I am going to visit them here soon for Tet and want to give them money and gifts. How much money should I give them (enough to be generous, but not enough for them to rely on me)? And what gifts should I bring? My two brothers have 2 kids each and they are all mid-teens, so I bought each family laptops for school / college. I was thinking candy? I had a bunch of candy that I had brought last time and the kids loved it. \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Icy_Beautiful1683  \n [link]   [comments]",

My family lived through the worst period in Vietnam history before we left for the U.S. \n A lot of Vietnamese (here on Reddit) hate Vietnamese Americans because we are anti-communist and accuse us as traitors. While Vietnamese Americans accuse Vietnamese in Vietnam as brainwash idiots.\n However, if we lived in each other shoes, we would probably do the same thing that each side accuses each other off doing. \n If you lived through the war and saw your people murder and torture by the communist government regardless if you are from Northern or Southern Vietnam, you would not be pro-communist. Similarity, if all you learned in school was the Vietnam War (American War) from the perspective of the winner (North Vietnam), then your view will be in favor of the current regime. \n Our views, experiences, attitudes, behaviors are shaped base on the context of our lives and those of our families. \n But one thing that we can agree on is that we want Vietnam to become a develop country.\n    submitted by    /u/Chris7thLegion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I principally lived in France, and I did not learn vietnamese when I was younger, I knew a little from previous trips. I am currently Việt Nam for 3 months by myself (it's been more than 2 months now) and I am speaking a lot better, can hold conversation. Somehow, most of the people here see me as a foreigner. When I approach them (bằng tiếng việt) they stare at me & hit me with the \"tây ạ?\" and ask me why I can speak vietnamese. I have to explain myself pretty much every time to anyone speaking to me, & also not to have the tourist prices haha. Also every time I go to the countryside, everyone stares at me like & talk about me like I don't understand them lol.\n ​\n It hurts me as I always considered myself vietnamese, as I lived with my việt kiều mom most of my life and growing up w vietnamese culture, I feel very vietnamese to put it simple haha. It starts to make me feel a bit sad, & even sometimes I feel wrong not to look viet enough & don't feel like I belong to this community. Everybody in France can tell I am asian from my features, but here I am a foreigner to them.\n ​\n Do you have any tips on how to approach this situation? Does anybody have been through the same experience? I think it would make me feel better to know that I am not alone in this. \n ​\n Cảm ơn mngười! :)\n    submitted by    /u/ljmsn  \n [link]   [comments]",

For me, even though I was born in Vietnam and currently live in the US (my parents still live in Vietnam however), I am not thinking of getting a Vinfast as there are many EVs which offer better value for the money, in my opinion (like Hyundai Ioniq 5, where there is a better brand cachet).\n    submitted by    /u/ToyotaCamryRAV4  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently started travelling to Vietnam for work, spending weeks at a time there (4 trips this year already, 82 days in country total - just since August). I brought my 66i and I've been doing hikes with some of the locals on the weekends. It's been amazing. However, I've come to find that my Garmin has almost no detail about any of the areas I hike in. No trails, no contour, no roads. Many times it is blank. It's fine for tracking where I go, should I need to find my way out, but it's a pain to try and plan or navigate some of our hikes when I can't really see what is out there.\n I checked Garmin's website and there's no maps to purchase. There seems to be third parties selling SE-Asia maps but I can't really get a read on how trustworthy they are.\n Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations? I'm heading back out in a few weeks for a 6 week trip, one week of which we'll be going deep into the woods in northern Vietnam for 4 nights 5 days hiking and exploring caves. I'd like to have my garmin properly giving me information.\n    submitted by    /u/OldManKiK  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are the local people of Vietnam keen on hanging out for NYE celebrations? Or is the lunar new year more popular of a holiday in VN?\n Also, what are some good ways to meet people and learn about the people and culture in VN? From what I've read, if you look like a foreigner (I am 190cm white guy from America lol) people will talk to you if they see you eating by yourself and are generally quite friendly. Is this true? I'd love to meet people and feel warm and welcome, unlike when I went to Australia and it felt almost the same as America--super lonely and hard to meet people.\n    submitted by    /u/Pollo_Perpetuo  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I have been denied by Hanoi immigration due to a 'immigration violation'. \n I still do not know exactly what the problem is and how to fix it! I am more than happy to pay a fine. I have tried many times to call and email Hanoi immigration but still no reply. I even visited Vietnam embassy in Thailand and London but they couldn't help. \n Is there anyone that can help me or give me a contact with someone that works in VN immigration so I can speak to them directly and fix this problem. \n I have wasted a lot of money and time on agents who take my money under many promises but then do not help at all!\n I am a British citizen and currently living in London.

We live in Vietnam. I normally drive an electric motorbike and don't have a motorbike license. I have a TRC. I've learned that one of the leading motorbike rental shops (QT Motorbikes) will rent a motorbike to me, but they require that I leave my passport with them. I don't like doing that. (Also, I might need my passport at a hotel or if the police stop us.) I'm looking for recommendations for a motorbike rental in Ha Giang that will rent a semi-automatic bike to me for two days without requiring my passport as a deposit. Thanks\n Edit: Would welcome hotel recommendations in Ha Giang and places to see within a few hours' motorbike ride, too.\n    submitted by    /u/RanyDaze2  \n [link]   [comments]",

Perhaps because the resource may be in Vietnamese?\n I’m curious about the wealth distribution by age in Vietnam. Been in Vietnam for a few weeks now. I’ve noticed a lot of people in their late 20s/30s wear nicer/designer clothes and tend to have fancier bikes than those older than 40. Although, I also know people that are younger may tend to care about these visual indicators of wealth more.\n Vietnam is a rapidly modernizing country, so I’d assume people born in the late 80s/90s have had better career opportunity?

          "description": "First time I booked them. Actually booked AA but the carrier was JAL. I thought JAL had a decent reputation.\n Other than some super efficient and sweet stewardesses this was not a good experience. \n  \nTried to upgrade to an emergency aisle seat for 100$. At first the very nice Caucasian worker said ok. But after checking with the Japanese JAL rep they said no. Only Japanese citizens can book it. Huh????? Can you imagine if AA said only Americans can book certain seats?\n \nInflight entertainment really blew. The movie selection was like a scarce selection of movies one might find at a rummage sale. They did have one James Bond movie. I ended up watching that and Shawshank Redemption for the umpteenth time. The hardware interface had such lag you never knew if a button press actually worked. Had to restart a few times. I know it's a lot to ask but nowadays a selection of podcasts is pretty common. Also, and this is in general, why can't airlines offer live newsfeeds? JAL had a day old BBC International segment and one Japanese language news segment.\n \nI sat economy. The seat was particularly torturous even for economy. It was hard and small. I spent the last 6 hours of the flight rotating my position trying to find new unused parts of my ass that would give me ten minutes of relief. I'm a medium size guy.\n \nThe food was typical airline food in this case limited to Japanese cuisine That was ok by me but I thought I'd mention it. I had two legs on this flight: BOS to NRT (14 hrs) and NRT to SGN,( 6 hrs).Both flights had the exact same menu. I just skipped meal service completely on the second flight. \n \n Maybe my experience was a one-off. Anyone want to share?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/AVelvetTip  \n [link]   [comments]",

My partner has been driving all over southeast Asia with me on the back for the past several months with no issues. However, we've only ever driven an automatic and we're a bit nervous as I saw a couple posts on here that said a semi automatic or manual was needed to do the loop. We messaged the scooter rental we rented from before when we did the Hai Van pass to ask them about the loop and they told us it was safe to do the loop on a 125cc automatic scooter with two people on it. We wanted something a bit bigger if we could do it on an automatic but they don't have anything over 125cc.\n Just wondering from people who have done it recently, especially with all the construction I've read about, if they felt that would be adequate. If not, maybe we might get a lesson on the semi automatic when we get to Ha Giang and see how comfortable we feel on it before deciding what to do? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/allycatsimba  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not sure if this is the right place for this question but everyone here is very nice so figured I’d give it a shot. \n Cảm ơn các bạn!\n    submitted by    /u/gnioros  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, after doing some research I get a lot of sources saying the north of Hanoi is the place to be.\n On one hand I'd love to get as much a vibe of Vietnam as possible, which seems the Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi would provide best. On the other hands, if the best sites are in the north, then I can totally be convinced to go there.\n Is there anyone who could give me some advice on this?\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/a_guy_named_rick  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, apologies for using English and the google translation below. \n ​\n I LOVE FOOD!!! One of the most exciting parts of coming to Vietnam for me is learning about the culture and food that Vietnamese people are so beautifully famous for. \n ​\n My problem(?) is that I have had gastric sleeve surgery so I can't eat much. Generally in Australia, my husband and I order one meal to share, but if I want something he can't eat or doesn't like, I will order my own meal and take the leftovers home to reheat later. That's going to be a little hard when I'm trying to eat as many different type of Vietnamese food as possible.\n ​\n Would it be offensive or \"bad\" for me to order a whole meal for myself and leave a lot of leftovers? I'd love for us to order 2 different Pho's and get to experience both but would it be a bad thing if we didn't eat it all? \n Any tips on how to explain/apologise for my limited eating capacity will be well received!!!! PLEASE! \n Google translate below:\n Xin chào tất cả, xin lỗi vì sử dụng tiếng Anh và bản dịch google bên dưới.\n ​\n TÔI YÊU THỰC PHẨM!!! Một trong những phần thú vị nhất khi đến Việt Nam đối với tôi là tìm hiểu về văn hóa và ẩm thực mà người Việt Nam vốn nổi tiếng xinh đẹp.\n ​\n Vấn đề của tôi (?) là tôi đã phẫu thuật dạ dày nên tôi không thể ăn nhiều. Thông thường ở Úc, vợ chồng tôi gọi một suất ăn để chia nhau, nhưng nếu tôi muốn món gì mà anh ấy không ăn được hoặc không thích, tôi sẽ gọi suất ăn của mình và mang phần thừa về nhà hâm nóng lại sau. Điều đó sẽ hơi khó khăn khi tôi cố gắng ăn càng nhiều loại thức ăn Việt Nam càng tốt.\n ​\n Gọi nguyên một suất ăn cho mình mà để lại nhiều thức ăn thừa thì có phản cảm hay “xấu” không? Tôi rất muốn chúng ta gọi 2 phở khác nhau và được trải nghiệm cả hai nhưng không ăn hết có phải là một điều tồi tệ không?\n Mọi lời khuyên về cách giải thích/xin lỗi về khả năng ăn uống hạn chế của tôi sẽ được đón nhận!!!!

We've been following the advice of only using Mai Linh / Vinasun or just walking, but a man at the rank queue guided us to a Saigon Tourist taxi at the queue. I thought he was the official taxi rank guide, but looking back obviously he was a partner / part of this particular taxi company.\n Taxi driver was chatty and had fairly good English, asking us about our home country.\n First issue was the exit toll - didn't realise there was one - he said we had to pay it, pointing to a sign on his sun visor. I asked how much and he wouldn't properly say, then as I looked in my wallet he reached over and grabbed it, went through the notes saying there were lots of big ones, and pulled one out. I really thought it was a 100k bill (but can't be sure) …",

I'm little bit concerned about Typhoons as in my home country we do not have anything relatively extreme. I read on news that Da Nang experienced Typhoon Noru - saw the videos, images and heard that there was an evacuation in thousands, so got scared a bit and thinking - maybe just go back to EU and sip beers there without worrying too much, haha. \n I do plan to stay there for a month or two as DN. Anyone who have been there and can give any pro-tips about that place, please let me know down below. \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/MaartinBlack1996  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, we read Da Nang is #3 hot spots in SeA. Based on these findings and recommendations, we booked ourself a good amount of time here.\n After spending 5 days in HCMC - which we really enjoyed - the experiences here in Da Nang didn’t really meet our expectations. We’re staying in the beach area, went to the city center, did Hai Van Pass & Ba Na Hills.\n We’re very curious about the history of this city. It feels like there’s put a lot of money into it years ago, but not very well maintained. Also they’re still building A LOT, while other properties seem unfinished.\n Is this city build to be Asias Dubai/Barcelona/Rio/Miami (since it has a beach)?\n We’re also looking for recommendations on what to do/see/eat here :)\n    submitted by    /u/edvrslit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sau một thời gian nói chuyện với tụi nó thì rút ra kết luận là kĩ năng nghe nói của mình quá kém T^T, nhất là khi nói chuyện với đứa UK và Úc. Không chỉ accent khác mà cách tụi nó đặt câu cũng khác quắc. Thí dụ khi gặp nhau UK hay hỏi \"Have you done much today?\" Lúc đầu mình nghe hổng ra cứ phải nghệt mặt ra hỏi lại, giờ nghe quen thì chỉ cần nó nói much là bắt bài được liền =)) nhưng vẫn là nghe được 50% của nó thôi không nghe ra được hết. Mình để ý cách tụi nó đặt câu hỏi và trả lời, và với cách mình được học cũng khác nữa, nhiều khi mình hỏi mà tụi nó không hiểu, nên thành ra ông gà bà vịt :))) để luyện tập thêm thì bên cạnh nói nhiều với tụi nó thì mình cũng coi show, program và để ý các nhân vật đối thoại rồi nhại theo, chứ cũng không biết còn cách nào khác không. Đặc biệt là nhiều khi muốn join conversation của tụi nó mà ko được cứ thấy vấp váp kiểu gì. Nói được 1 2 câu là ngưng nhảy số rồi. Mình muốn hỏi các bạn đã luyện kĩ năng nghe nói như nào vậy? Mình có tìm hiểu thì biết phải luyện theo intonation, schwa, diction. Các bạn luyện theo những phương pháp này thấy ổn hông? speaking của mình lúc trước cũng ko tệ lắm, 7.0 nhưng thấy cũng còn loay hoay quá. Hoan nghênh mọi ý kiến đóng góp. Any advice would help!

The only movie on Netflix they had was Dreamy Eyes (Mất Biếc) which was a pretty good love story, but not a comedy.\n In no way am I making an assumption based on the tiny sample size of the shows available on Netflix, but is comedy less popular in Vietnam as a form of entertainment?

          "description": "Hi. Just returned from Vietnam. My itinerary was roughly 4 days in tp HCM, 10 days up North in various places, then another 7 days back in HCM.\n I found that Hanoi was really active. Full of tourists, full of fun things happening. And most importantly, hotel accommodation was reasonably priced. Managed to get a good sized room with a balcony, at a good hotel, for around 650.000 in Hoàn Kiếm area, not five minutes walk from the lake. \n By comparison, on my second stay in Saigon, best I could get was a passable room in a really cramped hotel with paper thin walls, for about 1000.000/n. I did scour Agoda and Booking.com for better deals, but there weren't many to be found. \n And this despite there being very few tourists there (for some reason). That being the case, you'd think supply would exceed demand, and you'd get hotels dropping their prices in order to compete. \n Another example: In my first 4 day stint in Saigon, I got a nice room with a balcony, in a nice but slightly run down hotel on Để Thám, for around 835.000. I would have booked them for my second stay too, but for some reason, they decided to double the price after I left. \n I'm not whining. Just really puzzled by the economics of this.\n    submitted by    /u/DefamedPrawn  \n [link]   [comments]",

The crowd was almost entirely Western so I wasn't sure.\n \nWhen police drive through the streets saying things on the loudspeaker, what are they saying? People seem to move their mopeds but I wasn't sure.\n \nIs there any significance to the sunflower seeds people eat, or is it just a nice snack at the bar / restaurant?\n \nHow are tourists perceived in Hanoi? Do people (generally) have any anti-American or anti-Western sentiment? If so, is it generational?\n \nWhat are the attitudes of young Vietnamese people to the military? I know there is conscription but also it is relatively easy to get out of (?). Is military service considered a good or useful thing generally?\n \nAre the schools inside the city e.g. Old or French Quarter for rich people or are they local schools for everyone in the area?\n \nWhat might locals think about visitors' attempts to cross the road?

I just can’t shake off the feeling that I’m being exposed to the dioxin. Even though it’s 50yrs ago, it’s not like dioxin has an expiration date.\n If it’s still in the soil, how does it NOT affect the (tap) water, fruits, plants and animals? For example: if tap water comes from rain, the rain first goes through the infected soil and is pretty much untreated (doesn’t really smell like chlorine). People here also say it’s safe to drink boiled tap water and I guess they make pho’s and coffee with it. But how about heavy metals like lead?\n We’re flying to Danang today and just the feeling of walking around that airport where that stuff was at 50yrs ago stresses me out.\n Am I overthinking it or is my stress legit?\n I feel so bad for the locals that this happened.\n    submitted by    /u/fliefloeflah  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm so excited and have so many questions, but first, I want to ask about this topic which I have seen come up quite often when doing my research about Vietnam.\n Somebody posted an article here a few days ago about culture shocks when traveling to Vietnam, and one of the first things on the list mentioned that it's common to see men publicly physically assault their wives.\n I have been doing a lot of research about Vietnam, and while I love almost every other aspect about it, this topic has arisen so many times that I feel the need to ask you people who live there and have been there before. So many articles mention that you will see men hit their wives and as long as you don't interfere, you will be fine, etc. This really concerns me because of some instances of seeing this in my childhood that really bothered me, so I am really worried about seeing this in Vietnam.\n How common is it really? I plan to travel to the major cities like Hanoi and HCMC. Is it actually a super common thing to hear and see domestic violence? It really makes me anxious thinking about having to see and hear this and not be able to help. \n I guess I get triggered when I hear or see domestic violence and am wondering if it's something that I am likely to be forced to witness on a regular basis in Vietnam.\n    submitted by    /u/Pollo_Perpetuo  \n [link]   [comments]",
