Mình có tham gia tuyển TVHK (vi mình rất thích làm tvhk từ nhỏ) thì đã đậu, nhưng khi mình tìm hiểu hơn thì thấy hơi hoang mang ko biết có nên vào không. Vì phải đóng 1 số tiền khá lớn để training và với mức lương TVHK năm đầu tiền mình nghĩ bản thân sẽ gặp khó khăn rất nhiều, ngoài ra mình có nghe về vấn đề sắp chuyến bay nữa.

          "description": "I got married to a Viet girl recently and we argue about money a lot. I was born in Canada so my idea was that we would contribute equal percentage from our income for our shared expenses, and we handle the rest ourselves (to each their own money) - however she's not happy with it. She thinks that since I make more, I should contribute more than her since I will have a lot more money left. Is this the norm for a Viet girl? House chores we share 50/50 (I'd often do more because I want to) and everything else is equal but she won't budge about this part.\n Everyone is completely misunderstanding my point. We aren't doing the 50/50 split. I pay over 70% of everything. What I suggested was we both put half of our income into a shared account from which we would pay for our expenses. The idea of each of us having separate money to handle for ourselves was from her. The point here is that she thinks I should put more than half my money and she less so, so that what's left to each of us is more or less equal. She also wants to keep her job and not have children for at least another 7-8 years.\n    submitted by    /u/ZenDaFout  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm tired of working in the office with dramas and I'd like to be flexible so Freelance is my top choice. I've worked as an English teacher and content creator before. I am trying my best to learn more about digital marketing and photoshop for my future. \n I created my Upwork account and tried my best to apply and get proposals but there was no result. I was upset a little bit. my parents are older and they often get sick so I'd like to push myself in working freelance. Should I still look for a job patiently or get some free work and then get a rate? \n I can write English articles, create content on social media and get a good boost. Would you like to recommend me anything? I'm pleased to listen from you guys! Thanks in advance!\n Bonus: my house is noisy so I can't teach English at home or work as n English tutor.
