          "description": "To me, the tones of Tiếng Bắc and Tiếng Nam sound the same for the most part, save for dấu hỏi and ngã. However, I noticed that the tones of Tiếng Huế sound vastly different from the first two: dấu sắc is lower rather than higher and sounds more like dấu hỏi, and dấu huyền is higher instead of slightly lower, but not as high as a typical dấu sắc. A few days ago I asked a Chinese friend what the four tones in Chinese sounded like, and I realized that they sounded very similar to Tiếng Huế’s tones. Dấu huyền of Tiếng Huế sounds like the falling tone of Chinese and dấu sắc sounds like the rising tone. I can’t speak for whether dấu hỏi/ngã sounds like the down-up tone, as I do not know what hỏi/ngã sounds like in Tiếng Huế. Why do Tiếng Huế’s tones sound similar to the Chinese tones? I’m guessing because Huế was the old capital of Việt Nam, most likely where most of the nobles/elites resided. Being a noble probably meant you probably had be able to speak in Mandarin and write in Chữ Hán/Nom, which likely had an influence on how they spoke Vietnamese. Can anyone confirm my theory?\n    submitted by    /u/encrusting_acro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The news that Vietnam will have 70 Michelin Guide honored restaurants in 2023 is encouraging and long overdue. Vietnam's unique culinary traditions, blending multiple regional styles with influences from China and France, produce some of the world's most iconic and delicious dishes.\n From pho to banh mi, spring rolls to imperial court cuisine, Vietnamese food withstands comparison with the finest culinary traditions anywhere. The creativity, skill and passion of Vietnamese chefs across the country have produced cooking that has long deserved global renown.\n Having 70 Michelin-reviewed establishments will help showcase the diversity and quality of Vietnam's dynamic restaurant scene to an international audience. It will attract more food tourists, boosting the hospitality industry and local economies. Most importantly, it provides deserved recognition for the craftsmanship and dedicated hard work of Vietnamese chefs over generations.\n As a Vietnamese, I have long taken for granted the pleasures of Vietnam's cuisine. But global acknowledgement from prestigious groups like Michelin will be a source of pride for Vietnamese people everywhere. It demonstrates that our culture's softest power - our food - can compete on the world stage. I hope this is just the beginning and that more Vietnamese culinary masters will have their talents spotlighted in the years to come.\n Vietnamese restaurants have earned their place amongst the finest in the world. I hope the Michelin Guide and other international reviewers will help spread the word and introduce more people to the joys of Vietnamese gastronomy. Our chefs deserve this honor - now it's time for the world to feast their eyes and taste buds on what Vietnam has to offer.\n https://vietreader.com/travel/food/85667-70-michelin-honored-vietnamese-restaurants-and-eateries-in-2023-part-1.html\n    submitted by    /u/vinhta121290  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been using Zalo to communicate to my driver and team members when I'm back at my apartment / out of the office (I don't have Facebook, so this was a good alternative while out here).\n Unfortunately, I had to replace my phone last time and Zalo put me through some loops to basically \"re authenticate\" me by having someone already in my Zalo contacts confirm it's me. Naturally, that happened a few days before I flew back out here, so I was unable to get in touch with anyone when I landed (didn't realize this was needed until I landed). I eventually got hold of someone and they did the in-person verification.\n However, ever since then, the Zalo app keeps telling me I need to \"verify\" my account. It has an option to upload a photo of your passport but it doesn't seem to like an American passport. Do I need to verify? How do I do this? Anyone have experience making it work?\n I tried to chat with Zalo support but they only would message me in Vietnamese.

Doctors did not really give a chance to her looking at the severe burns on her body. However extensive surgery helped her to come through the ordeal. She later did her medicine in Cuba , where she met her future husband Bui Huy Toan. The couple later migrated to Canada , where they settled near Toronto.

The official word is that power cuts will be occuring daily due to \"El Nino\". \n Over the past week or so, my district (Long Bien) has experienced 5 outages that last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours at a time. We're told about them in the morning, so there isn't much time to plan around them as they start at 8 AM. \n Tonight, we've been told (officially) that the outages will occur each day for the next month. In my 9 years living in Hanoi, I've never experienced this before, yes, occasionally power will cut during a typhoon, but never like this. \n Does anyone else who is currently going through this have a backup generator? Is it worth investing in one? My wife and I run our business from home and we need to be online 24/7. We can't be out of the house for too long as we have 2 dogs that only pee outside and our son comes home for lunch and a nap each day. \n Need advice on how to deal with it. Can't move because we own our property. Should I buy a generator? Have you heard any information about the power cuts that might shed more light than our building's manager has already?

We are into nightlife, we party, close daytime social areas to meet people, make new friends, hit the gym, convenient parks to walk the dogs, prefer near waterfront with a water view, good mix of Việt and foreigners. Where do we look to live? We currently live in Hanoi on the lake, next to a park, lots of people gather and meet. We would love something similar. Places we have seen on listing that intrique us: Icon 56 building D2 Sanwah Pearl Golden River looks nice but no dogs. Suggestions welcome\n We want a mix of social, access to everything we want to buy, not overpriced but we aren't cheap, unique, where we can easily meet like singles and couples.\n    submitted by    /u/ScottVietnam  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tôi cũng đã có một mối tình 7 năm với vợ mình từ những năm đầu khi còn học đại học, chúng tôi cưới nhau 2 năm rưỡi từ trước dịch covid19, và chưa có con.\n Mọi thứ cứ trôi qua êm đẹp như vậy, đi làm kiếm tiền như bao người. Cho đến khi vợ tôi nghỉ công tác tại ngân hàng M… Việc này làm tôi khá khủng hoảng về tinh thần khi làm ca kíp về và liên tục bị trì triết, phàn nàn về nhiều thứ. Và vợ tự sinh ra cái suy nghĩ nghỉ làm thành gánh nặng của tôi, mặc dù tôi cũng rất tán thành việc nghỉ nếu công việc quá áp lực và không hiệu quả về kinh tế. \n Tôi chả biết do nghiệp hay duyên làm tôi có quen được 1 chị tiếp viên hơn tôi 3 tuổi vào đúng thời gian này. Không ai chủ động, chỉ nói chuyện về công việc rồi chia sẻ về cuộc sống, dần rà sau 1 tháng điều gì đến sẽ đến. Vâng, tôi có cãi nhau với vợ và rủ chị kia đi Hạ Long chơi và có qhtd. Ban đầu mục đích của tôi chỉ là giải toả căng thẳng, bằng một cách thần cmn kỳ xong chị ta yêu tôi. Rồi ngày qua ngày, việc chị ta cứ chia sẻ công việc (cùng ngành) mua đồ, quan tâm đến tôi cũng làm tôi có chút rung động :)\n Thực sự việc này tôi đã biết là sai ngay từ lúc rủ chị ta đi Hạ Long, tôi cũng vẫn rất yêu vợ mình chứ. Nhưng bản tính tham lam và râm tục của tôi làm tôi vẫn muốn giữ mối quan hệ này :( Chị ta cũng biết tôi có vợ và vẫn chấp nhận làm người thứ 3… Sau khi chia sẻ những lời này thì tôi vẫn đang có một gia đình đáng yêu và vẫn duy trì mqh ngoài luồng.

          "description": "My parents and the older generation of my family, those who immigrated to the US, have always said that American and Western foods are always too salty or too sweet. They always say that too much salt or sugar is used. They also say this is why American food is so unhealthy.\n I’ve mainly been raised up in the US and eat both Asian and Western cuisines but never found this to be true. I’ve always found most foods to be reasonably seasoned to my tastes. I’ve asked friends and family around my age, and they also generally agree with me. I also believe the whole “American food is unhealthy” myth to be untrue because that really only applies to fast food which you really don’t eat on a daily basis. It’s also a huge over generalization of American cuisine considering how diverse each region and state is. I digress though. Is it really true that Vietnamese/Asian cuisine use less salt/sugar and are healthier than American/Western cuisine, or is this more of a subjective to taste thing?\n    submitted by    /u/QuaintAlex126  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mainly I need help with the name. I'm trying to come up with a name that would utilize the Vietnamese word for descent; the name would be made by splitting up the word into syllables that could then be used to create a full name (ex: like the word danger being used to create the name daniel criminger). Unfortunately, I do not know a lick of Vietnamese. \n I'm struggling with two things: \n A) I'd like to be able to find a correct translation of the Vietnamese word for descent. I've tried a bunch of websites including Google Translate and ChatGPT and they all come up with different answers and \n B) I'd like to be able to come up with a realistic name, something that actually sounds believable, if that makes sense.

But they clearly didn’t, and even talked badly about it during the movie. EDIT: It was too artsy and chaotic for them. Too much going on.\n It’s okay if they didn’t like it since we are worlds apart when it comes to media consumption. I just hate that they didn’t at least stay and experience the movie with me and my brother. It had been a while since we had gone out to the movie theaters as a family.\n To make it worse, my brother is very hot tempered and told them to shut up several times while they were critiquing the movie, and even as they were walking out. I get where his frustration is coming from, but I don’t agree with how disrespectful he was. \n They waited for us outside in the car. On the ride home, I tried to keep the conversation light even if I was slightly annoyed. \n But the tension was clear. And when they confronted my brother about snapping at them, they all started yelling at each other. \n We just got home and there was a lot of door slamming. I feel really sad. If I had known the evening would end this way, I would have just gone to see the movie myself.\n    submitted by    /u/yungdragvn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm on contract for 2 more months in my apartment. I pay 13 mil a month. They're making 3 more rooms on this floor right next to my room so the noise is CONSTANT and LOUD. I cannot sleep. It's every morning and weekend.\n  Also, my roof has been leaking. I have a bucket to collect most of the water, but I need to empty it and mop the floor every time it rains. I've been asking them to fix it for a month or reduce my rent but now I just want to leave. \n I pay too much for this to be my reality. I only moved here because it was pet friendly, but my cat died 2 months ago. I'm off work for one month and would like to move while I have time, but they will not break my contact without keeping my security deposit, even if I feel the spirit of my contract is broken. How do I break the lease and get my money back so I can move? Am I shit out of luck? Cheers thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/KindRecognition1124  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys, I've heard that the installlation fee, maintenance fee, operation fee of having Air Conditioners (AC) in some western countries costs an arm and leg. And people in some countries in Europe don't have AC at home, according to some of my friends in France, Spain and UK.\n Sales of portable air-conditioning units rose 2,420 percent in a week, British retailer Sainsbury’s said during the hot season last year. Some in Europe are coming to accept that some AC usage may be needed to save lives. After a heat wave killed an estimated 15,000 people in France in 2003, air conditioning was introduced to some nursing homes in a bid to protect the most vulnerable. \n How do you guys feel about AC in Vietnam, where the prices are cheap and almost every household in urban cities like Hanoi or Saigon has at least one. AC in hot nation like Vietnam is true love or a threat to the environment?\n    submitted by    /u/TonyVnExpress  \n [link]   [comments]",

I looked it up on the NY consulate website and it looks like for expired passport renewal you basically have to apply for a new one. But the forms for that asks a lot about pre-immigration life such as where I lived, why I left, any and all relative information including their addresses, etc. And I don’t have all this information since I moved here when I was super young and I don’t know all my relatives especially their Vietnamese names and addresses. More importantly the forms are all in Vietnamese so I’m assuming I’d have to answer in Vietnamese but I don’t speak/read/write Vietnamese. I’ve tried calling the NY consulate but haven’t gotten through to them. Looking for any advice to make this process easier\n    submitted by    /u/freshsqueezedoj666  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Viet Nam!\n Over the last year or two, I've been coming across articles about how major smartphone manufacturers have been increasingly shifting operations towards India and Viet Nam.\n As you know, China has been pretty much the \"factory of the world\" over the last 2 decades and her socioeconomic transformation has been astounding over the same period to say the least. Sadly, I was too young to pay attention then.\n Because of a rapidly aging population and diminishing workforce, cost of labour in China has risen exponentially. Coupled with constant, multi-front geopolitical tensions, one can understand why having operations in China faces a diminishing risk-reward ratio.\n Looking at Vietnam's Balance of Trade, I see that it's surged post-2015, around the time the protectionist Trump administration got elected - which I suppose accelerated the trend of de-coupling from China. However, the Vietnamese Dong seems to be facing a constant weakening, unlike that of an export hub. Somehow, I never see reports about how these winds are affecting regular Vietnamese citizens.\n Have you noticed a surge in manufacturing activity in Viet Nam?\n If so, how has this impacted you? \n Has the surge been driven by MNCs setting up their own plants, or have they been subcontracting to local manufacturers?\n Also, have these factories been concentrated in particular regions and therefore limited in benefit?\n Do you think Viet Nam will experience the same breakneck growth in the next decade as China did?\n I'm excited to hear the perspectives of people living through the change!\n    submitted by    /u/polymathicus  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's suppose to start on the 3rd of June (according to the receptionist), but they have already practicing from the 30th of May. I don't mind the noise if it's until 22:00, heck even 00:00 is fine. But it's 01:50 AM and those motherfuckers are still singing and blasting EXTREMELY LOUD music. Nobody was able to sleep. Many tourists and visitors are staying near the beach, around the area. There are many hotels. Many have toddlers that need to sleep early. Many have tours that start as early as 7am-8am in the morning.\n Tried to call the police for the noise pollution and they're useless. \"Oops we can't do anything uwu\" 😑. Heard a similar situation happened in Nha Trang during Tet as well. Is this only in Nha Trang specifically or does it occurred in other cities in Vietnam as well? \n Update: The Khanh Hoa province posted this news today in the 31st of May, to remind everyone about the laws and rules.\n https://khanhhoa.gov.vn/vi/tin-tuc-noi-bat/phong-chong-vi-pham-phap-luat-trong-hoat-dong-van-hoa-the-thao-va-du-lich-3005\n Noise pollution is illegal in Vietnam and organisers have to follow the laws created by the Vietnam government. If laws are broken and not being followed, expecting some fine.\n \"Kết quả, Thanh tra Bộ Văn hóa, Thể thao và Du lịch đã xử phạt vi phạm hành chính đối với 5 tổ chức, cá nhân có hành vi vi phạm với tổng số tiền xử phạt 340.000.000 đồng.\"\n    submitted by    /u/Technical_Fee7337  \n [link]   [comments]",

I always try to smile and Learn the language, at least to say “please” “thanks” “hello” “very good” etc. In HCMC starts with some yelling and pointing fingers and laughing. In Da Lat some being attended with angry looks. In Nha Trang at the bus counter they even don’t want to sell me the tickets for my next destination and turning the face like I wasn’t there… at the hotel, the manager, was asking me if I taken something from the “minibar” ( literally 4 Pepsi cans ) 4 time in a row aggressively and threatening with checking the room…. Should I assume that’s the treatment that I’ll have all around the country? Of course there where people that wanted to help, but at the moment seems they are the minority… and please don’t read this as pointing fingers or in any bad way. As I said I just want to understand.

I´m using the \"Assimil\" language course book for self study to learn Vietnamese. \n Yesterday tho, I watched a video about the usage of Vietnamese pronouns by Tieng Viet Oi, which is a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching Vietnamese, and they explained the use of the pronouns in a completely different way than my course book uses them!\n Now I feel insecure and I don´t know, if I should keep on using my course book, because I don´t want to learn this major part of the language in a wrong way! I don´t doubt, that the infos given by Tieng Viet Oi are wrong, because they´re native speakers, but maybe my book uses rules that they left out? I don´t know! Can you native speakers out there tell me, if this use of the pronouns makes any sense, or if my course book isn´t a good source?\n ​\n 1.Dialogue:\n Person1, Stranger: calls other cô / Person2, stranger: calls other ông - formal setting\n 2.Dialogue\n Person1, waiter: calls other bà / Person2, customer: calls other ông - restaurant order\n 3.Dialogue\n Person1, knows other person, not closest friends: calls other anh / Person2, same as other: calls other chi (dot under i) - colloquial talk\n ​\n --> also the book explains the pronouns as:\n -cô: young women or women who aren´t married\n -ông: men older than 40 years\n -bà: elderly women or married women\n -anh/chi(dot): people you know and that are around your age\n ​\n (it doesn´t really consider the relationship between the speaker and the other person!)\n ​\n I´m sorry for the long post!

The thing is, her family might not be too accepting of our relationship because they have super traditional views. Her family matters to her a lot, and I want to give them a good impression (or at least not a horrible one). \n Any tips or suggestions on how I can approach this? Her family doesn't come from wealth, so I was thinking of giving a hundred or so USD dollars to each member of her close family (though I don't come from wealth either, a hundred goes a lot further over there than it does in the USA, and I thought it might be a good small amount), a couple nice gifts from America, and then of course showing respect and kindness at all times. \n But to be honest, I'm not sure where to go from there. Is there anything I can do to make them really like me despite their traditional views? Or at least even out the scale of hate vs. like haha?\n    submitted by    /u/lightningparab  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have no Vietnamese/Asian heritage myself, if that’s relevant.\n I’d like to do a special mother-in-law/son-in-law dance at the western reception, but it’s hard to find a suitable song. I want to find a song in Vietnamese for a slow dance that is appropriate coming from a son-in-law. Many songs about mothers talk about the mother raising the singer, which isn’t genuine to our relationship. I’m hoping to find a song whose lyrics work coming from me.\n Do you know of any sweet, heartfelt songs in Vietnamese that are about a mother-in-law? Or about a mother, but without focusing on how the mother raised the singer? Or a song about an amazing, strong person without any romantic subtext?\n My fiancée’s cousin helped me find Mẹ Yêu by Đỗ Phú Quí, which sounds perfect, but reading a translation of the lyrics, seems to focus too much on how the mother raised the singer. But maybe the sentiment would still work?\n Thank you for helping me make the day special for my (soon-to-be) mother-in-law!\n    submitted by    /u/lol43  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are both guys in our mid/late 20s from Los Angeles. We like nature (hiking + excursions), nature sightseeing, large cities, food, and partying.\n We were set on doing 2 weeks in Thailand but are now considering adding 4-5 days in Vietnam due to the recommendations of many family members & friends.\n Our initial plan was to do 3-5 days in Bangkok & Pattaya and then travel south for the remainder of the trip to see Phuket and Koh Phi Phi.\n So my main question is this: If we have 4-5 days, how would you recommend we spend it in Vietnam? Bangkok and Hanoi? Is it possible to truly experience these 2 major Vietnamese cities in that short of time? Should we omit one? Maybe reduce some of our time in Thailand?\n I understand there are dozens of great places we'll be missing...

We are at the top of the list for copyright infringement. There is a football livestream channel that violates copyright like Xoi Lac TV. There is a channel that buys Japanese porn, cuts it into many short clips, and then packs it and sells it to the American audience.\"\n Lam said the country in second place in the ranking accounts for only 5% of fraudulent income, one-tenth of Vietnam. Last week, Apple also announced to remove more than 8,000 infringing applications originating in Vietnam, many of which are content creation applications.\n The deputy minister said that this is a sad record, exposing the fact that besides positive content, many creators still do business and make money regardless. Part of the responsibility lies with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook when they can't control the content and users on the platform. Advertisers also have a responsibility to still spend money on dirty content.\n \"The state does not prevent businesses from wanting to advertise in cyberspace, but it is impossible for a money to flow into malicious content that businesses still see as normal,\" Mr. Lam said.\n https://vnexpress.net/100-dong-gian-lan-tren-youtube-55-dong-cua-nguoi-viet-4610452.html\n    submitted by    /u/quochuy2021  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Like many of you, I am increasingly concerned by the hate and hostility that I see every day in this beautiful community, especially between Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans. 😔 \n It is my firm believe that in our time and age, nothing is more important than mutual respect and understanding. So, in this spirit, I propose a new Vietnamese flag that symbolizes the indestructible friendship between the North and South; a new flag free of bad connotations; a flag that combines the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam. \n As we strive to foster stronger connections between Vietnamese wherever they may reside or what they believe, it is essential to have a symbol that represents our shared values of friendship and understanding; representing multiculturalism, love, diversity, respect and mutual understanding 🤝🌍\n https://preview.redd.it/002tzmjnop2b1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4fee59796edb5dd67668bdff04b4be0a250ccd22\n This proposed flag aims to honor Vietnam's rich cultural heritage and traditions (blue) and emphasizes the significance of unity and cooperation (red). The Golden Star represents the everlasting bond between Vietnam's people and their striving for greatness and prosperity for all Vietnamese people, regardless of their geographical location or political stances.\n With my loving heart, I invite every one of you to print this flag out, show it to your parents and especially grandparents and display it proudly in your windows. Let's propagate the message of love and friendship. Because only as an undivided ONE we can overcome the hate that has tormented this beautiful land for far too long ❤️❤️❤️❤️\n    submitted by    /u/Subscript5320  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In recent years, Vietnam has been making strides in the world of technology and innovation. With the rise of start-ups and the increasing number of high-tech companies moving their branch offices to Vietnam, is there a possibility that Vietnam, this Southeast Asian nation, could become the next start-up nation in Asia?\n The shift from China to Vietnam has been noticeable, with companies such as Samsung, LG, and Intel all establishing a strong presence in Vietnam. This trend is not limited to just large corporations, as start-ups are also finding success in Vietnam's growing tech scene.\n One reason for Vietnam's appeal is its young and highly educated population. According to the World Bank, nearly 60% of Vietnam's population is under the age of 35, and the country boasts a literacy rate of over 95%. This has created a strong talent pool for tech companies to draw from.\n Another factor contributing to Vietnam's potential as a start-up nation is its favorable business environment. The Vietnamese government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurship. The country has also made significant improvements in infrastructure, including expanding its internet connectivity and investing in new technology parks.\n However, there are still challenges that Vietnam must overcome in order to fully realize its potential as a start-up nation. One major hurdle is the lack of venture capital funding available for start-ups. While the government has taken steps to address this issue, more needs to be done in order to attract investment and support the growth of new businesses.\n Source & full text from https://www.micronews.site/2023/05/will-vietnam-become-next-start-up.html\n    submitted by    /u/very-creative  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do tourists usually visit there in summer? Do public buildings, restaurants and trains have AC? Do locals spend time outside during the day or do they usually try to stay inside?\n Pretty much what I wanna know is if I'll be able to have a good time despite the warm weather and rain.

Every morning I take a walk (actually, I want to jog, but the heat...). So I am walking down Nguyen Viet Hong, turn then into a small hem and come out at Le Lai. From there I need to cross the Pham Van Tri and enter the park (Luu Huu Phuoc). Easy. I've been doing it for a long time.\n This morning, when I approached the corner Le Lai/Pham Van Tri, a young Vietnamese, apparently agitated, was standing there.

I have travelled to Japan, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Laos, South Korea, Malaysia and Kong Kong but for some reason I overlooked Vietnam. She got me thinking of Vietnam and I have since developed an interest in travelling there and have read many good things about Vietnamese women.\n Obviously I am not going to be in a relationship with her (not likely with any Vietnamese American for that matter: even in big/diverse cities the Vietnamese are likely less than 1% of the population and moving to Vietnam is not an option).\n Still nice to know that such people exist however.\n    submitted by    /u/curiousandauthentic  \n [link]   [comments]",

We've been married for 6.5 years together for 10. \n I've been to Vietnam many times and I love it, when we touch down in Saigon I start getting an almost 'coming home' vibe. My Viet language skills are actually not too bad, so I can get around by myself, order my own food, shopping, basic conversation. \n Anyway, my in laws are coming here for a visit, it's winter so doing some of the really great Australian outdoor type activities, so we are gonna take them out for dinners, some shows etc. We have planned for a weekend away in a cottage in the countryside with some of my family. Now my in laws speak next to zero english, and my family speak no Viet. \n I'm just wondering if anyone might have some suggestions for some good activities we could enjoy together without having to rely to heavily on my wife to translate constantly. Like some games or activities or board games etc. We can do while enjoying a couple of beers by the fireplace. Hopefully someone out there has some suggestions, I just want them to feel like they're participating with us rather than just observers.\n Thanks ☺️\n    submitted by    /u/No-Scientist-1416  \n [link]   [comments]",

Wanted to share some things I saw for foreigners in terms of how to get into town with zero stress taking a grab.\n 1) Go through customs, Exit international terminal. Look for the green umbrella tents across the street. 100 yards max. cant miss them. 5-6 large green umbrellas. I dont ever remember seeing these before. \n 2) open grab and use the green umbrella area as your pick up spot.\n it should cost you 125k dong to get into D1. Grab will add 15k for the airport toll. Total bill should be about 140k + any surge. The driver pays the toll.\n Waiting for grab at 6am = 10 mins\n ride to D1 took 15-20 mins.\n Cost was 140k dong which is like 7 bux. and best was ZERO stress of being ripped. had 3-4 taxi guys approach and follow me to grab area.\n    submitted by    /u/trojanmana  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Foodie friend asked me to help ask around...\n La Maison 1888 is the French fine dining restaurant of Intercontinental Hotel Da Nang. This hotel is a 30 minute car ride away from the main beach because it is on the far end of the coast, and it does not allow Grab pickups out of the hotel. The restaurant is built into an old villa on a cliff, overlooking the water, and is very beautiful. They emphasize that they have the only 3 Michelin star French chef working there, and claim to be the #1 food destination in Vietnam. (Tasting menu is VND4-5M.)\n The advertising feels scammy because there is no such thing as a Michelin star chef. They claim the chef helped design the menu and he runs a 3 Michelin star restaurant in Paris, which is not the same thing and he is not in the Da Nang restaurant. Vietnam will only get Michelin rated retaurants in 2023, and only in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. There are very few blog reviews about the restaurant, and their TripAdvisor and Google Maps reviews do not imply that this is a legendary must try before you die place.\n Can Vietnam foodies comment?\n Sample blog post: https://secretlifeoffatbacks.com/20...-sun-peninsula-resort-the-ultimate-in-luxury/\n    submitted by    /u/josemartinlopez  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of them are tourist attractions and we’re afraid they’re gonna be overcrowded. Does anyone have recommendations on bars, restaurants or some interesting spots, some kind of hidden gems, places that’s not too popular, or some fun activities we should try there? We also plan to rent a bike there to move from Da Nang to Hoi An, if anyone has some tips we would really appreciate it!

I would love to revisit and go to the parts I didn't have time to see. \n Im posting on here because I'm looking for a friend I met on a night out in Hanoi on the 4th May called Patrick who is Swedish. I'm female from the UK, we had a great time when we met but we didn't get chance to exchange any contact details. I think he's still in Vietnam in HCMC, I'm now not. If you're on here hit me up, it would be nice to see what you are up to. Absolute long shot and very unlikely they are on here (I probably won't ever find him.) \n (I'm not sure if this is allowed on here and I will delete if not. Before I get any hate I understand that there are hundreds and thousands of tourists in Vietnam. Just thought I'd see if I could reconnect)\n    submitted by    /u/Psychological-Ad5642  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just wanted to relax my muscles from full days of walking, and only went to places that had signs saying \"no sex\".\n Landed in Hanoi a few days ago and went for a full body Vietnamese massage at a parlor where the women were dressed up in everyday clothing. So I thought this massage was gonna be like in Thailand, and solely for muscle relaxation and recovery from walking.\n I turn on my back and massage was good, then all of a sudden I start to notice the lady spending a lot of time in my groin region. I thought i may have felt really tight there, so maybe she was working out some knots..\n I was wrong, I was getting aroused, and she knew as well. Then tells me she'll give me a good massage and motions for a \"special\" type of massage..\n There was NO intentions of me getting one, and I thought I was just getting a regular massage as I always have in Thailand.\n Anyone else have this happen??

          "description": "My Viet boyfriend and I (South Korean girl) have dated for a year. We’re at the same age (2000 kids). We studied abroad at the same uni in Canada. Last year, my parents came to Canada to attend my convocation. I introduced him to my parents, and they're really impressed with him bc of his family background, handsome face, height, education and graduation job (these things are very important in Korean culture), \n Next month, he and I will travel to Vietnam for summer vacation and visit his parents in Hanoi. I wanna make them impressed just like he did on my mom and dad. \n What can I do to impress his parents?Especially when I come to his family house, and we do not speak the same language. \n Do old Viet people judge girls by their look, family background like Korean do? I’m quite confident but I don’t look like Viet girls.\n My Viet female friend say Hanoi parents are extremely conservative. Is that true?\n What gifts should I give to them? I have some high-end korean skincare products for his mom, but have no idea for his dad.\n Update: thank you guys for great suggestions. As I know from my Viet female friend, his parents are well off and live in a big mansion in Hanoi. That could mean they’re open minded like you guys commented. I’m confident in answering all questions regarding family background, I know rich Asian people care about these things. My dad also asked him about his dad’s job when we had dinner in Toronto. My boy has a brother who has a wife working as IELTS teacher. Both of them can speak English, so luckily I have more people to talk without translation and support me.

I actually think cows and pigs are just as smart and loving, if not more, than dogs, so I realized that I don't really have an issue eating dogs due to abuse because cows/pigs in the US are brutalized far more than dogs in vietnam (look up factory farming practices in the US if you don't believe me, it is truly an abomination).\n However, I'd like to \"kill two birds with one stone\", if you will. Can anyone recommend me a high quality restaurant (don't want to eat some street dog/cat or something) that serves both dog and cat?

My partner and I are staying in Ninh Binh want to rent a motorbike to see Tam Coc while we’re here as I feel it would be a waste not to. We’re just super nervous about renting a motorbike/scooter. I’m used to mopeds a little and we rented one earlier in our trip on Langkawi in Malaysia. But Vietnam traffic is something else lol, I feel confident enough to do it but wondering what other people’s experiences driving Ninh Binh to Tam Coc is? Outside the town how safe are the roads? Thank u in advance and if there’s anything we should see while I’m Tam Coc any recommendations would be welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/ifinkyourenice  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm debating on whether or not I should try it. Is it safe to eat? Like are these dogs bred to be eaten or are they diseased street animals that are caught and cooked?\n By the way, while I love dogs, I find it somewhat hypocritical that people will turn a blind eye to the atrocious factory farming practices deployed on cows and pigs, while judging the shit out of people who eat dog. As someone who grew up on a farm, I can tell you that both cows and pigs are just as intelligent, if not more, than most dogs. Cows will actually get to know you and love you, just like a dog, so please let's not judge people who eat dogs when America brutalizes and tortures cows.\n    submitted by    /u/CEO_VandalayInc  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I haven’t traveled internationally in over a decade so I’m nervous for the language barrier and ideally I’d want to visit multiple cities but this seems complicated in Vietnam. I also want to see Da Nang’s beach. Is seeing Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and Long Xuyen possible in a two week trip? I’ve been told by people to “hire a driver” but Ho Chi Minh and Long Xuyen are 3 hours apart, so I’m not sure if this is doable.

I’m using accurate biometrics, and the only advice I could find is for Korea, which may have different requirements than Vietnam. \n I have seen that when teaching in Korea, they tell you to select personal review. However that leaves a notice on the paper that states “not valid for use abroad” or something along these terms. However the hagwons seem to accept it anyway, and I’m not sure if that’s the same as Vietnam. \n Has anyone here used Accurate Biometrics before, and which option did you select before submitting your request? \n In the second to last drop down box on the demographics page, did you select for personal review, or the “visa requirement/living abroad” option?

I can sing a c scale while playing it on guitar and and can fake it in d minor but that's about it. If there are any instructors here I could use the help. I'm not trying to be an amazing singer but I would like to be able to sing backup for a rock/multiple subgenre band. If there are any vocal coaches, I want to improve my skills and am interested in your services. If there are any pros who can help I'm interested in your services. Thank you. If you offer vocal lessons please reach out. I live in Sài Gòn and can use all the help I can get. Message me if you are a teacher.

          "description": "I have this annoying pet peeve when it comes to parking my motorbike, whether it is in front of a restaurant or in some motorbike parking that when I come back I always find my bike: 1) moved somewhere else and mashed between other motorbikes, 2) the dude is sitting on my motorbike and smoking a cigarette, 3) both 1 and 2. I’ve been living here for about 5 years now and it still bothers me til this day. If I frequent a place then I usually build a relationship with the guy and give him a little extra coffee money to leave my bike where it is and to not do the things I stated above so it works out. But, when it’s a new place that I barely go to I usually don’t have that luxury and I become quite annoyed by this experience every time. I have a little bit of OCD and care about the condition of my motorbike and would like to keep it in nice condition. It really bothers me that I spend a lot of time and money to keep it nice just for some guy who doesn’t give a fuck to erase all those efforts in a matter of 10 minutes and scratch it all up. I understand that I don’t deserve special treatment when there are other people besides me, but this standard of service shouldn’t be ok especially when it’s my personal property and I am parking to be a customer at the place. \n If this sort of thing also bothers you, how do you deal with it? I find that most locals with old and beaten bikes do not care. But what if you have a nice modded bike or even a big bike that costs 150mil + vnd?

I am looking for a place that I can volunteer in exchange of accommodation, whether it would be teaching kids English, taking care of the elderly, or tending to the victims of agent orange, v.v...\n Doing this will give me a chance to integrate and connect with the locals easier. This is what I did when I first moved to Thailand and also in Portugal.

          "description": "Hello everybody !\n I'm from France and I visited Vietnam in october 2018. I loved your country so much, it must have been the best travel of my life. After that, I got interested in vietnamese culture, the food, the language, the music. I listened to popular vietnamese songs on Youtube. Not the oldschool, historically famous ones. More like the hits of the last few years.\n ​\n I remember listening to one song in particular and I just can't find it anymore. It wasnt the best song or anything, but it bugs me because I can see the video clip in my head and it's frustrating. Here is what I know about it : \n  \nThe main singer was a man \n It was released before the end of 2019\n The clip is at night, in a big city. A man and a woman are having fun, getting drunk, playing pool. And there's an underlying love story\n I think he's hoping something happens betweem them \n I think it was rap. But maybe not 100% rap ? \n  \nI know it's not much... But if it rings a bell to anyone, it would make my day and remind me great memories ! Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/NoBirthday4234  \n [link]   [comments]",
