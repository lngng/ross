I am a 23 year old boy from the UK and I have lived in Thailand for a year, is it similar?

As we begin to plan our itinerary, we are hoping to find a relaxing spot where we can unwind and swim towards the end of our trip.\n We've heard so much about the natural beauty of your countries and we would love to experience it firsthand. As described in the post on r/laos linked below, we would like to do a wild experience in the first weeks. We are hoping to find a beach or lake where we can enjoy some peace and quiet at the end of our travel. We are also hoping to find a spot with some amenities nearby, like restaurants or shops, but we don't want anything too crowded or touristy.\n We would really appreciate any recommendations you might have for a relaxing spot where we can swim and unwind during our trip.

There is one restroom stop on this route. We left on time and arrived on schedule. \n First of all the staff are excellent. Friendly and helpful check in agent and driver. \n Have no issue whatsoever with the customer service. For that this vendor earns three stars. \n Areas of improvement:\n VIP bus was messy. Had water bottles and trash from previous guests. Mini van was a little worn. Not as pristine as the photos but not terrible either. \n Where Cuc Tung looses stars is the driving experience. It was terrifying. The driver took unnecessary risks. There was low visibility due to fog and rain. Other travelers pulled off unto the side of the road but our driver's speed barely slowed down around the twists and turns of the mountain two lane highway And, he regularly passed cars while in blind curves. It was three a* clenching hours I was thankful to have survived. \n Safety should be a higher priority than timeliness.\n    submitted by    /u/Wild_About  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a few questions about the housing market in HCMC. I’m really just asking out of curiosity since I can’t actually purchase a SFR in Vietnam. Reading about Seoul’s fucked-up housing situation kind of freaks me out so I’m kind of curious about what’s happening in HCMC. \n My aunt “recently” sold their childhood house in D3 of HCMC for ~$500K USD. This is just what I overheard so I could honestly be mistaken, but this seems like a crazy amount for someone in VN to purchase considering the average annual salary of someone in HCMC. The only thing that stands out about this house to me is that it’s unlike the standard tall, narrow row houses with 4+ floors and had two floors, was much “wider” than it was tall, and had a backyard. It was a little out of place relative to the other structures around it. \n Is this “standard” pricing throughout most of HCMC? Sorry, I know this is a particularly stupid question since HCMC is massive. \n Do most people in HCMC “dream” about purchasing single family residences or has the goal shifted to purchasing a nice condo? Another family member told me that you can reasonably expect a newer condo to go for about ~$80K USD which still seems disproportionately high for the average salary, but I don’t know. \n Who is still able to purchase a “house” or a “condo”? \n Would you say the majority of people in HCMC today were born and raised there or moved there in the last 20 or so years?\n    submitted by    /u/lostnowlostlater  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Vietnam Redditors,\n Please, help me understand how Vietnam railways work, as I'm severely confused...\n I'm planning on visiting Vietnam in April, and wanted to book SE3 overnight train from Ninh Binh to Dong Hoi in advance. The problem is: I get different options depending on which website I use.\n If I try official dsvn.vn I can book a bed in 6-beds car, operated by, as far as I understand Vietnam Railways itself:\n https://preview.redd.it/wxgfmsgvj0ja1.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=246be640edd3e9d999b8fc3d4658c29828db0bb6\n If I search through baolau.com, I am presented with 4-Berth sleeping cabin, operated by New Livitrans Express:\n https://preview.redd.it/7zruwhogk0ja1.jpg?width=1143&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c6e0b44d9e051972fdff8c43c82546deb1438e3\n Finally, 12go.asia shows two separate trains, seemingly departing at the very same time: one operated by Vietnam Railways, another by Violette Express Train. Both seems to offer 4-Berth Sleepers?\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/yqnx4uq8l0ja1.jpg?width=1147&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32b9b500ac10f136f14364c06286222c51c4c4bb\n Whom should I trust? Is it a single train with carts by different operators?\n Any help will be greatly appreciated! :)\n    submitted by    /u/r4czek  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is clear that Vietnam is a unified whole, there is no \"southern Vietnam\" and there is no \"northern Vietnam\". The Americans invaded Vietnam and the northern Vietnamese had the silent support of the people of South Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam was able to kick the American troops out of Vietnam.\n The Vietnamese people were in the old regime, injected with money by the US and spent it personally and without control. When the US withdrew, they lost funding, their living standards were reduced, so they were not used to it and tried to blame the communists. If the US wins, then Vietnam is now divided into two poles and will always be tense like \"North Korea and South Korea\" - obviously of the same origin but separated.\n    submitted by    /u/KookyEnthusiasm92  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm set to go to Vietnam in just three weeks to teach English with VUS. It will be my first time in Vietnam. I have been given given two choices for where to work: in District 12 on the west side of the airport or in the far east of District 2. I've been told District 12 is more likely to be where I will be working.\n With that in mind, where do you recommend I live? I want to have a fairly urban lifestyle with lots to do, see, eat, drink, and shop. Districts 1, 3, 4 and such look quite nice but are super far. I'm not sure what is in District 12 as it looks quite far, so I'm not sure if it has more comfortable apartments or not. Any advice would be welcome.\n Also, is it generally easy to change your working location after a few months?\n    submitted by    /u/bacharama  \n [link]   [comments]",

I originally planned to live in D3 as it seemed to fit these criteria.\n I realise BL isn’t actually that far from these areas, but I’m guessing with traffic and other factors, it would make the daily commute quite long and tedious. \n I’d also want somewhere with decent accommodation options for around 8tr. \n Thanks in advance for the help!\n    submitted by    /u/ijintheuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've just received an ESL teaching offer from a well-known company in Vietnam. I would appreciate some advice on one of the terms in the contract, as follows:\n \"In addition, by law, [company name] must be able to show at such an audit as referenced in the Decree No. 03/2014/ND-CP Article 8, full and complete details of all employees who are working at [company name] […] Only original documents (they will state 'This is notarised as an original' or similar) will be returned to you at the time of your leaving [company name]. Any notarised copies will be returned after not more than 3 months.\"\n So, I am planning to notarise and legalise copies of my degree and CELTA certificates, and give these to the company so they can process my work permit. I don't want to spoil my originals with stamps, and I'd be reluctant to hand over my originals in any case.\n I'm from the UK, and the process for notarising and legalising copies for use in Vietnam is very time-consuming and expensive. I'm unclear why the company would need to keep these officially notarised and legalised copies rather than a digital scan or physical copy of these, if it's just for audit purposes (a copy of a copy if you like). I'm concerned that it might be a ploy to stop me obtaining a separate work permit in the event that I wanted to work for another company (after the 3 month period stipulated).\n Is this standard practice, or should I be concerned?

It's pretty cold here so I'm planning a 10-12 days work holiday trip to Vietnam soon, end of February beginning of march probably, looking for some spring like weather.\n I've read a couple of posts where people tend to lean Hanoi rather than Ho Chi Minh as a tourist destination but I am not sure. I would be fine with either. I understand Hanoi si less vibrant, more traditional, which is ok. I'm not looking for nightlife as I will be working. I don't want to exclude Ho Chi Minh though.\n It would be my first visit to Vietnam and I'm pretty excited. My concern is the weather, as I read that Hanoi tends to be colder? I'm leaving Japan for that reason, so I don't want to find myself in the same situation.\n Also, I would like to work with my laptop around the city and enjoy the famous Vietnamese coffee culture. Is it safe? I'm used to Japan where pickpocketing is not a thing and I read some posts here pointing out that snatching phones is rather common. Is that true? I would be screwed without my computer.

If there was civil unrest that threatened the Laos government, what would happen if China sent troops in under the guise of supporting the government or protecting their investments.? Given Laos has be a defacto puppet of Vietnam for much of it's existence and and there's always been rumours of VN troops supporting the government even in recent times against the Hmong and in the past against Thailand, would there be a response? I think it's fair to say that Vietnam at least considers Laos a part of it's sphere of influence, and while China would presumably prefer to continue to buy influence as they're currently doing in Laos and Cambodia, civil unrest could change things.

          "description": "Recently, ChatGPT is becoming a hot topic in Vietnam because of how accessible it is to normal users and follow that trend is a booming scam market regarding to create a ChatGPT account. Because of that, I decided to make a post to guide you how to create your own legitimate ChatGPT account.\n Dạo gần đây, ChatGPT đã trở thành chủ đề nóng được quan tâm ở Việt Nam vì dịch vụ dễ dàng tiếp cận đối với người dùng bình thường, chính vì sự bùng nổ đó kéo theo vấn nạn lừa đảo liên quan đến việc tạo tài khoản ChatGPT. Chính vì thế mình quyết định viết bài post hướng dẫn tạo tài khoản ChatGPT chính gốc của bạn.\n ​\n  \nBecause ChatGPT is not supported in Vietnam, you need a VPN to change your IP to another country. In case you don't have a VPN, vn-z forum provided a lot of vpn account for you to choose. Bởi vì ChatGPT không hỗ trợ ở Việt Nam, bạn sẽ cần VPN để chuyển địa chỉ IP của bạn sang nước khác. Trong trường hợp bạn không có VPN, diễn đàn vn-z có cung cấp tài khoản VPN cho các bạn thoải mái sử dụng.\n You need a foreign phone number for verification, I recommended smspool because it is reliable, cheap (depends on the country, most likely cost less than 1$) and I used it for my ChatGPT account myself. Các bạn cũng sẽ cần đến số điện thoại nước ngoài để xác minh danh tính, mình khuyến khích các bạn dùng smspool vì nó ổn định, rẻ (tuỳ đất nước bạn chọn, giá thành sẽ thấp hơn 20,000đ).\n  \nGood luck/Chúc may mắn\n Edit: ChatGPT is now supporting in Vietnam (11/2/2023), however you will need ChatGPT Plus for 20$. Depends on your need, my guide will be cheaper for you. Để tạo tài khoản ChatGPT ở Việt Nam tại thời điểm hiện tại, bạn cần đăng kí ChatGPT Plus với giá 20$ (470,000đ). Tuỳ nhu cầu sử dụng mỗi người, người dùng phổ thông không có 400,000đ dư giả để tiêu thì cách trên mình hướng dẫn rẻ hơn.\n    submitted by    /u/Former-Froyo3656  \n [link]   [comments]",

When im further south so of may family are joining me and im looking for somewhere amazing for them to stay. Id love it to be an island, ive been looking at a lot about phu quoc, but ive heard and seen stories about it being super touristy, a lot of building work going on and a lot of rubbish on some of the beaches. Is this true? Are there any other island or costal places you would recommend that are nicer with beautiful beaches and scenery.

Right now I am on two psychiatric medications. While it appears it would not be too difficult to purchase these medications from pharmacies, I would like to have someone in the city who can monitor the effects of the medication, ideally on a monthly basis. \n Are psychiatrists who have a good grasp of English hard to find in Vietnam? \n How much would a visit generally cost? \n Would going to a private hospital monthly to be evaluated be a feasible alternative? \n I've read about issues with 'fake' versions of medications; is there a way to ensure I can avoid these? \n Any additional insights would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/213114  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am 27 and finishing up a degree in the next 6 months to get my CELTA and hopefully teach in either Vietnam or Taiwan. This is something I've wanted since I was a teenager and I will be 28 by the time this becomes possible. My motivations beyond teaching English is to learn the language, however difficult Vietnamese may prove.\n I have been debating between Taiwan or Vietnam for years and have considered as many factors as possible, but one I would like some insight on is how difficult it may prove to form friendships with locals. I do not expect anyone to be enamored by foreigners and I am not looking for super deep friendships. I am not looking for a best friend and I am not looking for a significant other. I don't expect to be grabbing dinner or drinks constantly with locals. But I do want to be friends with locals and not solely rely on other expats.\n How realistic is this in Vietnam? I understand given my age where most people will be raising families and the language/cultural differences, that it will prove to be difficult. But once I get a working grasp of Vietnamese (however long and difficult that may be), could I expect to create some friendships with people besides other expats? From what I've read, this may be easier in Vietnam vs Taiwan, and I was looking for insight. I consider myself very friendly and I am always eager to make new friends, so normally this is not difficult for me but I have no previous experience to Vietnam nor living in a country where English is not the first language.\n    submitted by    /u/_SpicySauce_  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the time we had no idea of the future and really thought we would just visit the following year. Not knowing the world would be shut down. \n It's almost three years later and has life really changed. I'm a home owner now, have a daughter who is 14 months and a son on the way. \n Life has become very adulty. 😂 \n Traveling with my wife will never be the same but we always talk about our time in Vietnam.\n It's beautiful, the country is appasulty beautiful! The people are appasulty beautiful! We made such great friends on our trip even with the language barrier. Friends who we still keep in touch with till this day. \n I know we'll be back one day most likely when we're old. Going to have to skip out on the sleep buses and over night train rides at the point. 😆\n I hope we can visit much sooner than later with or without the kids. I would love to bring my children with me, I want them to be as well traveled as myself.\n I really just wanted to let everyone know how much I miss and love Vietnam and hope to see everyone sooner than later. \n Ps. I still have yet to find Cao Lau in the states.\n    submitted by    /u/NeverTeachTheWu  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apparently, in Vietnamese, you have to close your mouth for certain ending constants, so a word ending in ung would sound like “ungm.”\n My question to you guys is how say it. I remember teaching my friends how to properly pronounce the Spanish “t” by placing the tips of their tongues on the top part of the back of their teeth. I realize this question is kind of technical, but everything I’ve looked up doesn’t really address it or attributes it to an different accent or dialect (but both Northerners and Southerners do this from my knowledge).\n Any advice? Many thanks! Cảm ơn!\n I also tagged this as discussion since I can’t seem to get a clear answer on how to do this lingual maneuver.\n    submitted by    /u/gavinoba  \n [link]   [comments]",

But he especially looked at my husband and told me something. Then he sat down next to us on the other table and kept on talking to us. Finally I can hear what he was saying and he kept mumbling how my husband has to learn vietnamese to communicate. He had this painful, almost angry expression on his face. He seems offended my husband doesn't speak vietnamese somehow. \n The staff finally came over and asked him to leave. She was alone so she didn't know how to handle the situation. I asked her about him and she said he seems drunk and not from around the neighborhood. \n Does this happened to any of you? didn't know how to react, was uncomfortable during and after it. he stayed for at least 10mins just talk and talk and talk... so very weird\n    submitted by    /u/Cupcake179  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some (I'm sorry, very, very basic) questions.\n - Is there a good fish sauce flavored snack like chips or crackers I could find for her? I'm in Northern California and there are Vietnamese (or at least large Asian) supermarkets. \n - If I bought her a bottle of fish sauce for her kitchen is there anything likely to be in an American kitchen she could pair it with? Any brands you'd suggest? Is fish sauce something you pretty much need to make yourself?\n - If I stop by a local Vietnamese restaurant, what could I order (and it wouldn't surprise if the answer is 'anything') that would have a lot of fish sauce? Spring rolls?\n ​\n Any help is appreciated!!!\n cảm ơn (looked it up!)\n    submitted by    /u/OurHouse510  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "That's probably one of the biggest turn offs for me, maybe Im just too westernized or whatever but my love for the country has soured quite a bit ever since I was a teen. And because of the past you know that stuff will never go away. More recently exceptionalism has manifested through promotion of cultural aspects. Best food, best scenery, friendliest people ! Humble my ass. Why learn about any other culture or move anywhere right ? Vietnam's the place to be type shit. Most people just love the country, they dont think we're the chosen people or anything, it's more so the attitude online and the media sometimes that bug tf out of me\n    submitted by    /u/onetimethatsall  \n [link]   [comments]",

The people were great, everyone had a huge \"togetherness\" spirit when COVID started.. Now.... I absolutely hate it. Everyone, every day, is trying to screw each other over. Old people are vile and rude as fuck, acting like a bunch of gorillas. Everyone has an agenda. Companies are dishonest. People try to kill you on the road and act cowardly when confronted. When I came here, I was on TV talking about how great Vietnam is, but I've never in my life been tricked, lied to or screwed over as much as here. I am deeply depressed and miserable. HOWEVER, I am trying to reconnect with the reasons why I loved this place. One last ditch effort to regain happiness here.. maybe some of you can help me re-ignite that spark again.

          "description": "I do not think the news was already posted here, but the Michelin Guide is coming in Vietnam. First edition of the guide will be released in June.\n I think it’s a great think for Vietnam – It will help a lot the restaurants aiming to offer fine dining especially Vietnamese ones.\n What are your prognostics about the potential decorated restaurant in Vietnam?\n My opinion:\n - No 3 Stars Restaurants. I really do not think any venue in Vietnam is there yet. Bangkok does not have any 3 Stars Restaurants.\n - Anan Saigon: I really see them decorated. I tried them few years ago it was great, but it seems what they offer now is more elaborated. It’s the only restaurant in Vietnam that made to Asia’s Top 50 + their food relates a lot to Vietnam\n - I also think that the Guide will give one Star to a good Street food stall / place either in Ha Noi or HCMC. The guide did that both in Thailand (Jay bee) and Singapore. It’s a way for them to not appear too snobbish and it’s good PR…\n - Maybe one or two high end French Restaurants from Ho Chi Minh City: I have tried 3 Gourmands / La Villa / P’tit Saigon / Le Corto. All of them are great but I guess inspectors of the guide have been eating a lot in “similar” restaurants. I am just not sure if they will be \"good enough\" to get one Stars with French Cuisine. I could also add La Badiane in Ha Noi to this list.\n - One or more Japanese Restaurant? Likely – There is so many great Japanese Restaurant both in Hanoi et HCMC. I have just not tried enough of them to have an any name in mind.\n For the locals not familiar with how the Guide works ( I have seen many mistakes both on Facebook and local news sites) we wrote this article: https://amthuchiendai.vn/tat-ca-nhung-gi-can-biet-ve-cam-nang-michelin/\n    submitted by    /u/mebetyoufold  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Xin chào các bạn!\n I'm Vietnamese-American (28F) and have visited my family in Việt Nam several times. But, the last time I visited was in 2016. My husband and I are planning a long vacation in Việt Nam late summer this year and I was wondering what street fashion for young adults in their 20s is like now, for both men and women. My husband is white so he's going to stand out no matter what, so I'm not worried about looking like I am a \"local\", but am really just interested in how street fashion has changed since I last visited and what is commonplace now. \n In college, I met an exchange student from Việt Nam and when he saw me wearing short running shorts, he was appalled and asked why I was wearing those. I was confused why he was so shocked and he said in Việt Nam, only prostitutes wear shorts that short (they were like...mid-thigh length). This was back in 2014, though... I have no idea how accurate that reaction was to what's commonplace though because I've never been there long enough to really notice or outside of my family's district to see much else. \n Cảm ơn nhiều!\n    submitted by    /u/polyhymnia2000  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I would like to know how is the worklife in Vietnam (e.g. working style, hours)? Obviously companies are not the same - is there a large difference when working in a Western company and local?\n My concern comes from previous experience, when I was working in a Chinese company, and did not find the working style to be suitable for me. I felt that there was not enough freedom to conduct work within the strict corporate hierarchy. Also, had too much unnecessary work (internal processes), which requires constant overtime. Are Chinese and Vietnamese working styles similar or different?\n I'm currently working in senior management, and I'm not able to speak Vietnamese.\n All comments highly appreciated!\n Tldr: planning to move to Vietnam, would like to know more about the worklife\n    submitted by    /u/Beet-Bandit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Usually when you go to the more diverse provinces (Lào Cai, Hà Giang, ...), the hotels are all run by Kinh people. I once asked a hotelier in Sapa about this and he said 'they [referring to Hmong/Dao] don't know how to run businesses', which was amusingly direct.\n Anyway, any good recommendations in scenic areas in the far North? I would love to fall asleep to the sound of a different language (Hmong, Dao, Tày, anything really) being spoken by the proprietor's family.

Food was amazing, the street food blew my mind, I ate banh mi twice a day, daily and never got sick of it. Never got to try pho but I had bun bo hue and others which I don't knkw what it was, I just pointed the picture, nod and bow a little cause I felt bad that I couldn't speak Vietnamese.\n My mistake was not knowing that Vietnamese was celebrating Lunar New Year and most shops were closed for 3 to 4 days and we didnt get to see, eat most of the food we wanted to try, experience the culture, went to vung tau on the 4th day instead, wrong choice I would say because I think the locals went there for holiday or went back to their hometown, that's my assumption, so the traffic was pretty heavy but it was a fun.\n I should have gone there on the 5th day of Lunar New Year/Chinese New Year but all and all, it was an amazing place, fell in love with Vietnam just like how I fell in love with Japan when I first visited it, Extremely friendly, yes I can't express enough the friendliness of the Vietnamese\n My next trip is to visit Hanoi, any recommendations of place to visit? Food to try or anything that the locals usually enjoy\n Thank you, from your neighbour, Malaysia\n    submitted by    /u/Financial_Buddy_76  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, talking to a few people has made me think it might be better to do it guided, most likely with Jasmine Hostel. Does anyone here have experience with the pros and cons of each? \n Personally I like the idea of doing it without a guide because I have more freedom to stop and take pictures, explore off the beaten path, do some hiking, and stay longer than 3 nights if I want to. The pros of doing it guided is the social aspect, staying at the best homestays, and the guides knowing the best views and all that. \n Any feedback or ideas would be appreciated.

          "description": "I figured I'd put this here as it is more of a specialist recipe compared to the scope of a more generalist subreddit like r/cooking, and the Vietnamese food subs are not exactly what could be called active or even semi active. \n So I have seen various Vietnamese style grilled eel recipes (example: Chargrilled eel in lemongrass and turmeric (luon nuong xa) recipe : SBS Food) that are very much tickling my fancy. I've thought up a cooking method that sounds to me like it would give good results, but it's not something I have ever seen suggested anywhere else so I have no idea whether it would work.\n Specifically, what I am thinking about is pre-cooking the eel before grilling it by poaching in nuoc cham, and then finishing on the grill. What I hope to accomplish with this is: \n -Getting flavor throughout the eel without having to worry about prematurely denaturing the proteins by using the nuoc cham as the poaching liquid. The lime juice in nuoc cham would do that if the eel was raw, but would not if it was just the cooking liquid because the eel would be cooked before denaturing could happen.\n I also intend to pierce the eel with a fork to get even more flavor throughout, if need be.\n -Setting the stage for a caramelized, crispy finish. The sugars in nuoc cham would be all over the meat and allow for good caramelization.\n As I said though I've never seen this suggested before, so I have troubleshooting questions. Specifically:\n -My primary question: will poaching in nuoc cham make the eel TOO strongly flavored? I like my food a bit more strongly seasoned than most, but as nuoc cham is so strong, I would be cautious about overflavoring here.\n -Would the sugar content end up to more rapid burning than expected when finishing on the grill? I absolutely abhor burnt food so a heads up warning if it is a fine line would be much appreciated.\n Thank you so much and I can't wait to branch out to this area of Vietnam's cuisine!\n    submitted by    /u/CulinaryLightbulb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Out of convenience (we will have suitcases) I've planned to stay roughly a week in Ho Chi Minh, explore the surroundings then fly to Hanoi and stay there roughly a week and explore surroundings. I'm just not sure if this is the right way to go about it, I feel like we would be missing out on a lot of stuff if we are just sticking around the main cities. Would it be better to just spend a few days in Ho Chi Minh then head north a few hours each day by car and stay somewhere new every night or every couple of nights? I'd love any suggestions on some good accomodation, sights to see and just any must do activities while in Vietnam. We love all natural wonders such as mountains, national parks, rivers ect but also want to have some time just exploring and hanging out in the cities and experiencing some night life.
