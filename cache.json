          "description": "My partner and I are planning on visiting Vietnam around March / April next year and am having a bit of difficulty nailing down a trip that doesn't seem too packed! We're in our early 30's and like a bit of a mix of adventure (more myself) and relaxation (beach time).\n We're travelling from Australia and there aren't any direct flights to Hanoi so we'll be flying in and out of HCMC.\n Below is a planned schedule but something (maybe multi destinations) have to go unless we can pull superhuman strength. We're locked into 17 nights and can't do any longer unfortunately. Would love to hear your recommendations about what you might consider leaving off, and where to possibly spend a bit more time.\n Day 1 – Fly into Saigon. Arrive late so just stay somewhere near the airport.\n Day 2-3 - Fly to Hanoi. Spend 2 nights staying in Old Quarter, visit some sights, food tour etc.\n Day 4 - Spend morning in Hanoi before getting an afternoon bus / limousine to Ha Giang so we can see the views on the way (or should we just get a later bus and spend a few more hours in Hanoi?)\n Day 5-6 - 2 night Ha Giang Loop tour\n Day 7 - Finish Ha Giang Loop and arrive back in Hanoi late\n Day 8 - Do an overnight cruise in La Han Bay\n Day 9-10 - Head to Ninh Binh (Tam Coc) for 2 nights\n Day 11 - Spend day exploring Ninh Binh before getting overnight train to Dong Hoi\n Day 12-13 - Get bus from Dong Hoi to Phong Nha, explore caves and do a single day tour with Oxalis / Jungle Boss\n Day 14 - Get DMZ bus to Hue\n Day 15-17 - Motorcycle ride from Hue to Hoi An via Hai Van Pass, spend 3 nights in Hoi An relaxing / beach time\n Day 18 - Flight from Danang to HCMC before flying out late that night\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Nightgoat91  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I read it seems like as long as I have the correct Vietnamese Paperwork it should just be a submission and waiting period. I would like to have both my US and Vietnamese Passports.

Which is weird, since I know it's optional to place one's hand over chest while doing the anthem, and it means pledging allegiance to the flag but don't think it's exclusive for Americans.

I saw people saying it is recommended to arrive 2–3 hours earlier just in case, and we are fine with that however, this means that we would need to be taking the grab from our Airbnb to the airport probably at 4/5am in the morning. \n My question is, is it safe to take a grab car this early in the morning? We would be in Ho Chi Minh! We just want to have some confirmation that it is indeed safe, as we are both quite young and have never really travelled before.

I bought a coconut off a lady at a drinks stall just cause she seemed really sad sitting there alone and I felt a little choked up thinking about how much she might have sold tonight in the muggy heat. \n I get that it’s off season now but it really feels like this town lives off of tourism as I don’t see a lot of locals dining out and I might be projecting but a lot of the businesses seem to be struggling. \n I just feel very sad seeing all these restaurants with flashy signs sitting empty and potentially even guilty when I make eye contact with the employees inside as I catch glimmers of hope in their eyes that I might come in and dine. \n I’m recovering from a tummy bug and taking precautions as to not eat at empty places and there are so many coconuts I can buy from a place to support the local businesses. \n It’s really lovely here though and the people have been so kind. Other than being slightly hotter, it hasn’t even been as rainy as in HCMC so I wish more people would come and visit this lovely place.\n    submitted by    /u/SuspiciousGlitter  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had been drinking her Ca Phe Sua Da for years, and I loved it so much I would buy one almost every single day. Unfortunately, she closed the place indefinitely around a month ago, and I have tried many places since.\n The one thing I noticed was I would find the street coffees drastically better than the ones sold in those fancy cafeteria places with ACs and Jazz music playing 24/7. The street Ca Phe Sua Da are sweet, rich, just bitter enough, and their temperature is perfect - not too hot, not too cold. \n It is extremely hard to match the flavor with the one I had been drinking for all these years though. Some places make it too bitter with little sweetness, some make it taste like a milkshake. The \"closest\" one which I kind of enjoy comes from, you guest it, the nice middle-aged lady not too far away from my grandma's home. \n Is there a secret to those street coffees? I want to remake it myself, all those years drinking her coffee and now she closed it, it kinda hurt a little bit :> \n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/jacky2409  \n [link]   [comments]",

And at the kid's pool area, I could notice that it's much harder for me to find a kid being in shape than to find a kid who's not. Almost every little kids I saw carried a big belly with them. There're so many adults who are overweights too.\n I know that one public pool with max of 100 people isn't exactly great of a sample size to draw conclusion for millions of Vietnamese. But it does raise some concern, because in my experience, Vietnamese parents don't really care much about diets, calories and nutrions. They all thought the fatter the kids, the better, and subsequently trying to feed them as much as possible. And if they aren't gaining in size and being underweigh, it's not their \"growing up times\" yet. Fast foods aren't really that popular, I think, so we can't blame it on them\n I was 173cm, 45kg for most of my childhood, throughout my earlier years, my parents and relatives has kept telling I'm not at my \"time\" yet, and kept taking me to doctors and they weirdly said the same, not \"my time\" yet. Turned out at 22 years old, I was still that skinny. It's not until I decided to eat like hell and learn nutrions did I gained 10kg in 2-3 months.

My Vietnamese is pretty good but not good enough to understand what she was trying to pull me over for. I remember my uncle saying something like if they give me a hard time just give them $20. I literally gave her $20 and she’s like no it’s $50. And to shove it discreetly in the drawer for her. I didn’t carry that much cash with me and was planning to withdraw some from the ATM. And I didn’t like how that lady was threatening me so I called my aunt. My aunt told me to ask her for the citation receipt and she said she was trying to help me but we can do it the “hard way” and I have to pay $200 wtf. My aunt wanted to speak to her and she told me to hang up and refused to talk to my aunt and told me I’m a grown adult to take care of it myself. Luckily my aunt knew someone in the airport and he spoke to them and they let me go without paying anything. I wasn’t annoyed they do shady stuff like that, I was annoyed how she spoke to me!\n Edit - I’d also like to point out that scanner lady is a complete moron because she asked for my passport and didn’t flip to the right page with all my info.

I knew immediately when I wanted treatment that I would never get it from any big or small general hospital. I found one that specialized in mental health and was able to get \"what I need\". Which means pills and an affirmation that I have what I suspect I have, nothing more. Still, that was better than other people's stories. One person shared that they were publicly mocked by the doctor in the mental health department of Bạch Mai for their suicidal tendency. My God, what the fk!\n Horribly, I told my parents, who were not equipped to handle this, so they reacted \"unhelpfully\".\n - They broadcasted my private situation whenever and to whoever they wanted, without me knowing.

But in our daily like we don't hold grudges or actively say hateful thing toward the nation and it people from the invaders day. Like in our daily life we still talk about them with no hate feeling and very neutral. Except for China, China still actively messing with us and have not give up. Even though, our economy is greatly effect, reply on China we aware of them.\n That my perspective as Vietnamese live our daily life. So what other nation is like, because it seems like China still hate Japan, media about Japan and protry Japan as bad where china kick their ass still very popular til today. From Japan media, it seem like Japan still effects by some contract with the US but from some Japanese movie it seem like also protray Japan have their sin. And worst of all is racist thing in America, black still hate white af and still think they are oppressed today. This remind me how different that is in Vietnam, because we also have minority. If you live in some era where you can still see some local people living among us, they look actually very different than the usual Vietnam people, some also have really dark skin and different hair, if you look in too school system there are also advance thing you can get if you are \"Dan toc thieu so\" (Wait a minutes, we too have black people). And if you take a look at history, we totally invaded them local, But we are never have racism or hear of them, Now they are one of us.

She wasn't in her right mind, and it makes me so upset that people could say such a thing in front of a patient.

          "description": "Hey!\n I’ve been in Vietnam for about two months now and I’m currently sat having a coffee on the Walking Street. One of the buildings across the road started throwing what looks like money and rice off the roof and everyone started yelling and scrambling to grab the notes. There’s now a crowd (with people running up the street to join) and it looks like they are handing out money.\n I was just wondering if anyone could explain what’s happening?\n Thanks :)\n Edit: this is in HCMC as I realised I didn’t add that before. The building is a guest house but the ground floor is covered in yellow flowers and flags so may be a religious site\n    submitted by    /u/Calm_Lake4947  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'd like to add that things are rarely black and white, and parents rarely abuse their children for their own pleasures.\n Most parents genuinely love their children and family. And you can see that they themselves are victims of toxic parenting and they themselves suffer from the mental trauma that they don't know. We can try to convince them that their way of parenting is wrong but with generations upon generations of trauma and \"tradition brainwashing\" (so to speak), coupled with the lack of Vietnamese language resources, it's really hard for them to realize that the traditional way of parenting is damaging to the mental health of their children.\n So it's up to us the younger generations who are equipped with better knowledge to break the cycle, be more understanding to our children at the same time try to fix our own mental trauma so that we don't fall into the old ways.\n    submitted by    /u/GrapeJam-44-1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm looking at traveling to Northern VietNam (Hanoi) in December. For some context, I live in Canada, will be traveling solo, and am looking at going through a couple weeks. \n  \nAfter doing some research, it seems that one of the biggest challenges is getting around VietNam. Alot of posts say the best way to get around is by motorcycle, however I don't have a motorcycle license nor do I know how to ride a motorcycle. With motorcycle out of the picture, what is the next best way to get around?\n One thing I've found from traveling to other places is you save $$$ when you book tours through the street vendors and not through the airline/travel agency. Are there street vendors in VietNam that you can walk up to and book a tour right then and there, or is it better to book them beforehand? I've seen a few websites selling travel excursions in VietNam.\n Almost all the excursions to Ha Long Bay I've found include an overnight cruise. Being December (one of the worst months for rough seas) and someone who gets sea sick easily, is it possible to go on a boat for a few hours and head back to Hanoi on the same day? Or is it better to spend the night somewhere around Ha Long Bay?\n What would be a good way to get to Sa Pa? Google says it's ~5 hours by car and ~7 hours by train. Similar to Ha Long Bay, is it recommended/possible to stay in Sa Pa overnight?\n Any other recommendations?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/ub3rst4r  \n [link]   [comments]",

I mean, Vietnam, or any Asian country for that matter, is heavily affected by Korea entertainment industry. Korea, in itself, is a kingdom and trend-setter in terms of entertainment and beauty, it's no doubt we are somewhat influenced by them. Most of our hairstyles, or fashion styles, right now follows what's trendy in Korea, which would affect what Vietnamese choose to wear and what clothes are produced and promoted for men fashion. \n I've heard Vietnamese men complaining complaining endlessly on Facebook too, wondering why women likes such girly boys. But I think if they don't have any appeal at all to women, they won't be that successful and loved. Maybe what men thinks women find attractive is drastically different than what women actually find attractive.\n For me, as a gay men and somewhat masculine, I find half of them very pleasing to the eyes, very \"pretty\", the other half too effeminate for my taste. They are \"beautiful\", but not \"hot.\" But it depends on which idol though, some has a perfect blend of masculinity and feminity, of handsomeness and gracefulness that makes them hotter than any 6-packs Western bros.\n Do Vietnamese men like the image of male K-pop idols?\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate-Bit9246  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've never understood people's obsession with having a son, a male heir. My father, for example, abandoned his previous wives because they couldn't bring him a son. It was not until my mother, and not until having 5 daughters prior to having me, did he have a son.\n But sadly, that son, which is me, is gay. Don't you think it's ironic? The way my father was obsessed with having a son, and he turned out to be gay? I guess it's his karma. Never mind, he abandoned my mother too and he has never existed to me in my mind.\n It's just that a family in my neighborhood, who are really poor, they have three young daughters already and they're still pushing for another one in hope it's a boy. Watching the mother with a big belly and three daughters already barely having enough to eat and study pains my heart. \n Why the obsession with having to have a boy? Um, he could be gay, you know? He could be a transgender. He could die young? He could be a drug addict and a failure, in which case you must have 3 or 4 sons in case then?\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate-Bit9246  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the midst of crazy public holiday traffic last night I jumped out of a Grab when I could not knowing my phone slipped from me while doing so, and by the time I realised and ran back he was gone. As a solo traveller it was daunting to think what I should do and what I couldn't do without my phone. Trying not to panic, I went to the nearby security guard of a mall. He understood the gist of what I said and took me to the mall information desk. Now, I assumed in the crowded noisy and busy place they would just wave me away and say go to the police station or something. But they jumped into action, got my details and number (thank f*** I had my Vietnam phone number written down seperately on hand), took my photo and messaged security to go over CCTV to try to get the car plate number, let me use their phone to see if I could get any Grab details from my email, and kept calling my phone when they could. \n The CCTV couldn't get a plate number. I feared the driver wouldn't hear my phone or would just keep it, but eventually the driver answers. He had finished for the day but would drive back, although it would take time with all the traffic. I expected he would want a compensation for time and fuel and honesty, but when he eventually arrived he refused the cash in my hand. I made him accept a bag of those holiday moon cake things the mall was selling as a thank you, and I also went back and bought a couple for the information desk ladies afterwards. \n This is a simple faith in humanity restored post because I feared the worst and was touched by how much they cared, especially at such a busy working time for them, for some tourist. Caring for others makes a difference.\n    submitted by    /u/foln1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Không biết ở đây có ai nắm rõ về lịch sử không, nhưng tôi khá là tò mò về vấn đề này:\n Nhìn theo mốc thời gian, giai đoạn này chữ Quốc Ngữ đã tồn tại, thậm chí còn có cả báo ra bằng chữ Quốc Ngữ (Gia Định báo, 1865).\n Hai cuộc chiến tranh Nha Phiến đã kết thúc (1860). Pháp đã chiếm xong Lục Tỉnh (1867). Về lý thuyết, dường như không lạ nếu có người Việt nhìn ra sức mạnh của phương Tây bấy giờ so với triều đình nhà Nguyễn. Điều này căn bản không khác gì lối suy nghĩ của Duy Tân Minh Trị ở Nhật Bản lúc bấy giờ cả. Nhưng thực tế thì theo ghi chép lịch sử có ai như vậy ở Việt Nam, nhất là khu vực phía Bắc không?\n Đồng thời, phong trào Văn Thân từ năm 1864 đã có, khởi nguồn cũng ở miền Bắc, Trung. Bình Tây, sát tả nhắm vào người Công Giáo, nhưng khó có thể phủ nhận còn giết hại cả những người không theo Công Giáo (lương dân) thân Pháp, nhất là sau biến cố Bắc Kỳ (1873).\n Vậy giai đoạn ở giữa thì sao? Có bất cứ ghi chép gì về sự tồn tại của một ai đó đã bắt đầu tiến hành Tây học vào giai đoạn này không? Nếu có thì cách nhìn của xã hội với (những) người này như thế nào?\n    submitted by    /u/GammaRhoKT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I'm curious and just wanted to hear more about how English teachers in Vietnam felt and managed while in Vietnam. I've selected Vietnam as my first teaching destination.\n -Monthly income? What did you actually make as an entry level teacher?\n -How many days did you really work each week? Was it exhausting? Start time & End time.\n -I plan to take Vietnamese language classes during my free time. Will I have time outside of work for languages classes?\n -What's the most efficient way to learn Vietnamese from scratch? I know its extremely difficult to learn. My goal is to at least be about to speak like a Vietnamese toddler after 1.5 years of practice.\n I'm also very introverted and at times a little closed off. I just have to fight that habit I have of isolating myself. Idk why I love alone time so much haha. But overall I have positive interactions with almost everyone and Im pretty approachable. I hope to come across people from all walks of life while in Vietnam. My parents are Nigerian but I was born in America so I got to experience two cultures growing up. I just love learning about other cultures.\n Lastly, how's dating/making friends scene in Vietnam?? I would like a social life. \n Is a long term stay feasible as an English teacher in Vietnam? Or at all as an English's teacher. I do hold a Masters degree, Im hoping that helps with future promotions after I gather more teaching experience. What do you think?\n I'm also a Registered Nurse in America. Im 35 years old. Im 6'3 and Black. Would I do best in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh?\n Advice, honest opinions and experiences are all welcomed.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Mammoth-Marketing-58  \n [link]   [comments]",

I figure I can stick to seafood and vegetarian options, but wondered if anyone had experience trying to eat halal or kosher (as I know both these follow a strict 'no pork' criteria) while in Vietnam.\n Thanks in advance :)\n ​\n Edit: Thank you to everyone who has offered advice. It's been extremely helpful as I was really worried I would be limited in experiencing the delicious cuisine. I will be taking u/meh2280 on his suggestion that bun cha is worth it - I just got some meds from the doc so I can limit my diarrhea to just a day or two and only eat it on days where we will be staying around our accommodation and relaxing! haha sorry if that was TMI. \n Special thanks to those of you who also translated some food names into english for me.

I thought I was being kind when I let one guy polish and fix my shoe but in the end I got threatened by a group of them with hammers and had to relinquish 500,000d to them. \n I’m planning to return soon. How can I avoid being a victim of this scam if they come up to me n polish my shoes again? Do I shoo them away or just resign myself to fate as a tourist in VN? Will the police help if I manage to get their attention? \n Serious answers please! 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/mando_jango_mango  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've seen a few different people say that it's always helpful to consume some sort of media in your target language to familiarize yourself with the sounds and pronunciation, even if you don't understand anything. This of course isn't going to be my primary method of studying but I'm sure it would be a useful tool, especially with English subtitles but that isn't a requirement. Does anyone have suggestions for something I could use that is mainly in the northern accent? I can listen to podcasts/radio shows at work, or it could be content creators or TV shows/movies for in my free time. I would appreciate any ideas!

I'm not sure. She keeps telling me that if she doesn't like me that she'll just tell her husband and that they won't let me live there. \n The husband has been very laid back for the most part, it seems like she is just testing me somewhat and wants to make sure I'm a nice person and a good renter. \n Anyway, I wanted to ask is there some kind of gift I can get for her or the family that would show my appreciation to the family for renting the room? I'm fairly new to SoCal which has a large Vietnamese population as I'm sure you know, and I'd like to get the something as a housewarming gift and to show my appreciation.\n Thanks in advance, much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/goes231even  \n [link]   [comments]",

For all days I kept receiving notifications with money caming out from my card. And when contacted them, they informed me that they were buying perfumes, cosmetics and wines.\n The annoying part is that they didn't even spend the money for themselves. They spent it to buy souvenirs for people I don’t even know and they didn't even meet once every couple of months. My sister bought gifts for her mother-in-law’s neighbours, my niece bought gifts for her classmates. I already bought lots of cosmetics and functional foods for my sisters and cousins at home so there isn't much they need to buy. I already covered the expenses of the whole trip, so with this It feels like I am even paying for people who didn't even do anything for my life.\n The culture of buying gifts for everyone when travelling is something I couldn't understand. They didn't even contribute one penny when we work our ashes out to afford holiday. Why do we have to buy them gifts when we enjoy the sweet fruit of our labour?\n    submitted by    /u/aliceito  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a foreigner - an American, and the situation is much the same in many parts of the country here. In addition to this, there has been a fairly constant push amongst some people to legalize marijuana here, and it seems likely to me that it will be made federally legal some time in the relatively near future (though I don't think the country is quite there yet). I was curious if it is the same for Vietnam - what is the general sentiment on marijuana laws?

I am meeting my best friend who's been living in Germany for the last 8 months. It's going to be a fairly quick trip, and neither of us knows the best way to go about it.\n As it stands, we are meeting in HCM and we have a total of 16 days before I need to fly back from HCM to Australia on the 21st. Currently, we're thinking of spending 8 days in HCM and then another 8 days in Hanoi, as Google says Hoi An will have bad weather. I wouldn't mind going to Sapa as that looks good too, but I'm at a complete loss as to what to do and where to go.\n I have some general concerns as this will be my first time overseas from Australia and im not too sure what to expect. \n with that out the way the only solid plans I have are landing in HCM on the 5th of Oct and flying out on the night of the 21st. Any advice would be appreciated. Also, I just want to make sure I don't make any rookie travel mistakes during that time. I know there are massive differences in weather across the country during that period and Im mostly just looking to find the driest / sunniest place to go that time of year. Apologies in advance im just a bit confused as every website I see gives different advice and wildly different weather predictions. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Curious-Hour-5034  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As an (obvious) \"western\" tourist here, I often have the feeling you cannot walk more than 50 meters without someone approaching you who is after your money (especially in cities). In principle that's fine, it's natural that a lot of people earn money from tourists and have to approach them, so I do not mind. However this leads to me getting used to say \"no\" to basically everyone taking to me. \n Today I was walking to the post office (~20 min away) in HCMC with postcards in my hand, and someone driving by (regular guy, no grab jacket or anything) stopped and asked if I was looking for the post office and if he could help me. Out of habit I immediately told him no thanks, but afterwards reflected if I was being mean to someone genuinely wanting to help.\n Similar situations happened several times... So my question: am I being naive, is anyone offering help expecting a tip/money anyways? ( I was also asked for money straight away after someone helped me with a minor think taking 20 second, with rather ungrateful response after I gave only 20k.) Or am I being mean to people and assume they are just after money if they are genuinely nice? And how can you tell the difference?\n My common sense from \"back home\" does not really seem to apply here, hence my questions.\n    submitted by    /u/Square_Piano7744  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I've only visited Ha Long Bay and Sam Son Beach, and Sam Son has not exactly ever been recommended by anyone, so I think my opinion might be skewed \n I love visiting Ha Long bay. I, in fact, has been doing it all the times, alone. I'm afraid it's just sentimental reasons though, It's just that have treasurable memory there. It was a very difficult time of my life, and someone invited me to go there with them. I remember just lying on the golden sand, gazing my eyes up on the blue blue sky, immerse myself into what felt like just emptyless. A big, blue sky and a boderless sea, just made you felt wanting to melting into them, merging with them, disappear into just some bubbles with them. Just plain peace and tranquillity, some tranquillity I deeply needed that time. It calmed me down, calmed my every torments down.\n From then, I always make chances to go there, just to lie on the golden sand again. I only chose when there would be least tourists, even if that means during a storm season. Storm, brings in another kind of tranquillity. \n But I'm afraid I might be biased. I always tell people that in Vietnam, I love Ha Long the most. I'm afraid the reason I love Ha Long is not for the fact it's actually great there. To gaze into the endless sky, any beach would do.\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate-Bit9246  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know this could be a controversial topic, but I really need to get this out there so we can hear each other's opinion.\n I have had a motorbike driving license for 8 years. My bike is reaching 30,000 km traveled intra-city. I've got used to the bustling metropolitan lifestyle.\n But I cannot trust my life on the bike. I've realized my body is out on the open, and each day it's like large cars are out there to get me. During rush hour, the sidewalk is the road. I cannot help but feel guilty for pedestrians who should have the right to the sidewalk, but again, my right of way is being violated by the cars too. City traffic IS deadly if you're a biker, I cannot say otherwise.\n Why allowing such a risky vehicle to become the nation's top chosen transport? Why putting next to none effort in enforcing helmet safety? Why aborting the trolleycars, a totally cool public transport?\n I really need to hear your thoughts.\n Disclaimer: I am not a foreigner. I've lived all my life in Vietnam and married to a third generation Hanoian family, whose members are exclusively chauffered or taking public transport, and advise me to stay out of traffic.\n    submitted by    /u/Optimal-Onion-7830  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I am a person who loves Vietnam very much and has traveled here many times. My favorite destination is the sea in Vietnam, and I have discovered many beautiful beaches suitable for relaxation. Here are the top beautiful beaches in Vietnam that I would recommend:\n 1. Lang Co Beach, Hue\n https://preview.redd.it/pwikjgdh37kb1.jpg?width=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1c23e31562a1a517529d1b6210d53dd76dd40f5\n This is my favorite beach. Lang Co Beach is very clean and beautiful, as well as having a wild beauty. I am a person who does not like beaches that are too crowded with tourists and are interfered with by travel companies or resorts, so this is an ideal place for those who love natural beauty.\n 2. My Khe Beach, Da Nang\n https://preview.redd.it/inksi4zs47kb1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d44aeb8b8290eecbb18e5bd35d44ad093bd842e5\n Although it is pretty crowded with tourists, the scenery is still beautiful, and there are many exciting activities on the sea that you can participate in, such as playing volleyball, surfing, or. I highly recommend the Paragliding service Paragliding in Da Nang. Should join once in a lifetime to admire the city scenery and enjoy the beauty of Da Nang from above.\n 3. Mui Ne Beach\n https://preview.redd.it/2tzaoes737kb1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b9b48b16c9be0969a10ce85e79b64b51503ee36\n Mui Ne is suitable for resort tourism, with luxurious 5-star resorts along the coast. Mui Ne Beach will give you a feeling of peace, not hustle.\n There are also many beautiful beaches in Vietnam that you can refer to in the Top 10 beautiful beaches in Vietnam. I rate the shores of Vietnam as very beautiful, and next time I will evaluate some coastal resorts for those who intend to go to the beach for reference.\n    submitted by    /u/gabrielle3010  \n [link]   [comments]",

I frequent vegetarian places from bình dân food to restaurants like Bà Xã and I would frequently see monks. Nothing that sounds out of the ordinary, right? Most of the time I’ll see monks that would dine in pairs, usually eating in silence. Then there are groups of normies who accompany the monks, and sometimes one man or one woman with a monk. And this is a one time occurrence that I’ve had a friend tell me, he saw a ‘monk’ bring into a vegetarian restaurant his ‘ghệ’ and sneak in beer. He and his lover were kicked out of the establishment.\n So….. I guess I’m curious of a few things. Is it important for some people to want to build a rapport with monks? Is treating them to dinner a part of gaining good merit or something?

Also between Hanoi and Ha Long?\n How different are HCM and Hanoi? Are they both worth the same amount of time?\n What is the public transport like in the cities? What is the best way to get around?\n What kind of weather can I expect during September?\n I obviously still want to be able to use my phone for internet while I'm over there. What's a good sim card option for tourists?\n Even though I'm bound to visit some bars during my stay, I'm not much of a drinker anymore. Is there anything else that's good to do at night in these locations that doesn't necessarily involve drinking?\n What should I expect to pay for things like food and drinks?\n What's the best way to see Ha Long?\n Is there any other advice you have for a solo tourist that might not be obvious to foreigners?\n Anyone want to hang out with a random Australian passing through?\n I did have some other questions, but I've forgotten them.

          "description": "Hi! So a little background is probably needed for this.\n I am currently living in Denmark as a sort of exchange student and recently went to a local Vietnamese place. I started speaking with the sweet lady who worked there and tried asking different things in Vietnamese. We got to speaking (it’s really funny cause our only common language is Danish, so neither of us were speaking our native tongue once we got past my very broken Vietnamese) and we had a wonderful conversation.\n At one point, after hearing my dogshit Vietnamese, but realizing I love Vietnamese food and people, she did the thing I’ve only ever seen before and invited me to her home. \n My question is, how do you respond to this? I said thank you of course, but do people ever accept the invite? Refuse? Is it rude to go or not to go? I’m not sure if it’s one of those things people say but don’t expect a follow through on, or if it is something where they want you to come. I don’t mind going at all, but I also really don’t want to impose. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. \n Ps: lady gave me a bag of pears too and refused to let me pay.

They sell Phở and other kinds of noodle soup.\n But they also sell this dish. I don't know what's the correct name for it in English, but it's pork's brain boiled in water and added with some herbs. It's called \"Óc Trần\"\n So I came in and ordered a bowl of Phở. The owner nodded, signaling that he heard it. I suddenly felt the urge to eat that pork brain dish, I then spoke out loud to me, saying,\n \"Anh còn óc không vậy?\" Which is roughly translated to \"Do you have any brain left at all?\" \n The owner looked very shell-shocked at me, looking very confused. I thought he didn't heard me correctly, I spoke even louder, \"Anh có óc không ạ?\", which is \"Do you have brain?\"\n The whole stall and everyone on the tables were looking at me confusingly, and the owner looked even more shell-shocked! I still then didn't understand what was wrong, I told him that, \"Óc trần ạ!\", which is \"Boiled brain!\". He changed his facial expression immediately to smiling, lol\n Sitting down, I still didn't firgure out why he and other people looking at me that weirdly. It took me a few minites to realize how horrible that could come across, lol!

          "description": "Like, it's just suck. And here's why:\n  \nMemorization: While memorization IS a necessary skill for real life, it's one of the most useless one. There is loads of other skills an education system should focus on for helping students with later life. However, just look at the Vietnamese textbook. What did you see? IT'S JUST MEMORY! There is nearly no other skills. Critical thinking? Zero. Creativity? Zero. Heck, only logical thinking has some representation, and that representation is minuscule in my opnion. I can't think of a reason why don't they teach other skills rather than just memorization.\n Obsession over Grade: This is the worst problem by a long shot. Due to (let me check what it's called...) confucianism, the Vietnamese people value education. Don't get me wrong, this is a good thing, but for some reasons, it has turned into an obsession over grade and score. And well, just google \"bệnh thành tích\" to see how bad it is. Tbh, I think it is not exactly the fault of the Ministry of Education, but it's too popular to not mention.\n Underpaid teacher: Self-explanatory. This forced teachers to teach more in bonus class (idk how to translate học thêm, sorry) and create more stress to already stressed kid.\n Boring asf: Also self-explanatory\n  \nTbf, they are trying to fix these problem, and while they are not even close to fix these, theres still some progress.

          "description": "I've never experienced theft firsthand before and this experience has been not so pleasant in my memory. At noon time on August 22, 2023, I parked my red Honda Wave motorbike across from Eddie's Wok in Thao Dien. Specifically, it was a sidewalk with other parked motorbikes, so I figured it might be a parking spot, even though there were no guards. It was stupid of me to believe that surveillance cameras would deter any bike thieves. I stopped at Eddie's for lunch and when I was done, I found my motorbike to be missing. I reported it to the authority of phường Thảo Điền and it was all that I could do. \n I now realized that I was naive to park at a place with no security. I really liked that bike and I've had a lot of good memories with it. I also lost two helmets and a raincoat was on the bike. Like I said, I've never experienced theft before and I really hope that the police can get it back.

          "description": "Hi guys!\n A group of friends and I booked a trip to Viet Nam on a whim because the flights happened to be quite cheap from Indonesia end of August.\n We will be landing in Da Lat which we were interested in because the city looks unique, and will be departing from Ho Chi Minh city. We'll be there 28th Aug to 7th Sep. Currently the plan is to be in Da Lat for 3 nights in the beginning, then in Ho Chi Minh City from 3 Sep onwards. This leaves the 31st to 3rd on our schedule empty for potential things we can do. \n Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do or places to go/stay on those middle 3 nights? Maybe somewhere off Da Lat and HCMC, or on the way between those two cities?\n For example we were potentially looking at checking Bao Loc out for something kinda off the beaten tourist path, but are wondering about how to get around within the city there. Is Grab readily available etc. \n Second thing we were wondering about is how reliable the inter-city buses are. We could find schedules but can't figure out how to book them online, so is it simple to go to the bus station and book tickets? How early in advance should we book them and do the tickets run out fast on the routes from Da Lat -> HCMC? Also would you even recommend going by bus between cities for tourists with no command of the Vietnamese language save for Google Translate camera? We were thinking of going by bus for a more affordable experience and to sightsee/experience how traveling through the country by land is, but of course a plane ride between the two cities is still an option.\n Really excited to visit Viet Nam as I've never been there and I appreciate any help you guys can give! Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Cryvern1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Mình năm nay 19 tuổi, đang học tại đại học mà mình không tiện nói tên. Trước khi lên đại học mình đã mong muốn và nghĩ rằng khi lên đại học, tập thể lớp sẽ rất vui nhộn như cấp 2 hoặc cấp 3, thậm chí là hơn cả thế, nhưng mà mình đã vỡ mộng hoàn toàn sau 1 năm theo học cùng lớp. Số buổi lên lớp của trường mình không nhiều, chỉ có 3-4 buổi mỗi tuần. Lớp mình là một tập thể không đông, trước đó thì có 20 người nhưng sau đó vì nhiều người không theo được nên đã chọn đổi ngành hoặc trường nên cuối cùng lớp mình chỉ còn có 14 người. Ngỡ tưởng dân số ít thì mọi người sẽ mở lòng giao tiếp với nhau nhiều hơn nhưng kết cục vẫn đâu vào đó, ai cũng khiêm tốn và kiệm lời, chẳng có sự sôi nổi, chẳng cãi vã, chẳng tranh luận, lớp lặng im, đã vậy còn chia thành các nhóm nhỏ khác rồi chơi cùng nhau trong vòng đó (đa phần quen nhau từ trước), mình cũng có một nhóm nhưng hiện tại thì chỉ còn mình mình vì những người khác rời đi hết. Biết trước chuyện này xảy ra nên ban đầu mình có giao tiếp hay lại gần để trò chuyện cùng các nhóm khác, nhưng mà nỗ lực có vẻ không thành khi mình ăn trái bơ nhiều và các bạn có vẻ không muốn tiếp tục cuộc hội thoại. Không chỉ trên lớp mà thậm chí trên mạng xã hội, mỗi lớp đều sẽ có một nhóm zalo để chia sẻ thông tin cũng như trò chuyện, nhưng mà kì lạ là nhóm lớp chẳng ai nói cũng chẳng ai hỏi, vài tuần thì có tin nhắn thông báo sau đó lại chìm nghỉm, mình nói gì mình hỏi gì cũng đều nhận lại được đó là một đống bơ từ cả lớp, trong khi mọi tin nhắn khác mình đều thả tim hoặc rep lại để tạo sự tương tác 😢 biết là chẳng có gì đáng trách nhưng cảm giác quá đáng thật. Mọi người có giải pháp nào cho mình để có thể kết thân cùng lớp không ạ? Ai cũng bảo hãy tận hưởng đời sống sinh viên mà sao mình không thấy gì đáng tận hưởng hết á.\n    submitted by    /u/Clear-Raise-6695  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Suddenly feeling the urge to ask this question, because while the US is more well-known to be more open-minded about gender expression, I feel that the male beauty standard there is actually quite strict and harsh. \n I only see the most buff, shredded, muscular guys being presented in American movies and series, and only them is positively presented. The \"nerds\" and the skinnier guys are often portrayed as a joke, a laughingstock. This might be a blindspot of mine, and I might be jumping to conclusion too early with not enough observation. But I feel the male beauty standard in the West, or at least the US, is very big, very jock-like, buff-y, brute, masculine-ish.\n And while Asia, or Vietnam, is said to be more conservative, but I actually feel like we allow men to be more things. The big, buffy with tan lines image is accepted. Also accepted is the slim, fair skin, quieter, smart, sweet and soft-spoken, \"thư sinh\" type. Nobody has to be big and shredded with 6 packs to be considered a man. Am I right about this?\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate-Bit9246  \n [link]   [comments]",

Over in the US, I worked in a logistics company for 2 years and I have my Bachelor's degree. \n My cousin who is in the logistic field recommends that I teach English instead ( I do not really want to continue my logistic career either tbh) because the job prospect in VN is not great for logistics.\n However, I do not want to teach large groups of people. Is it easy for new English teachers to find jobs teaching small groups or even 1-on1? Does anyone here teaches English but only work with small group or individuals?\n I heard being an English teaching assistant was decent, does anyone have experience in this job?\n What about teaching Vietnamese to foreigners in Vietnam? \n I am a little bit lost when thinking of jobs and it is creating some anxiety.\n Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/ConsciousTomorr0w  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm the only male in my family, my mother has singlehandedly raised both me and my sister up. \n Anyone living in Vietnam, or especially the northern part of it, would certainly understand the pressure put down on the men in the family line to get married and have children. But the thing is that I'm gay, and I'm not planning anywhere in the future to deceive any girl into a marriage with a guy who doesn't love them, just for my selfish motivation, which is to \"fulfill responsibility.\" Despite having had many girls showing interests and some even confessing their love for me, it would just be a very cruel act to rob away a girl's chance of true love and happiness in life just for my selfish reason. \n And I don't want to have any kids either, even if I'm a straight guy. But my mother is getting older too, and she does deserve having a grandchild to care for, to have someone to brighten and bring her happiness at her later years. But even for that, I could just adopt a child, there's no need to lure a girl into marriage just to have a child.\n But I don't even want to adopt kids. Best case scenario, I found a guy who's my true love, we're both financially stable enough to be able to adopt and raise a child with love. Much more likely, I would end up alone, I much more prefer it that way though. Living to the very end of my 40s, then that's enough.\n Do you know anyone who's a Vietnamese, who chose to live like me, choosing to live alone for the rest of their lives? Do they got respected? Do other Vietnamese look down on them?\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate-Bit9246  \n [link]   [comments]",

She is thinking of becoming Austrian citizen but unfortunately Austria doesn't allow dual citizenship, meaning she needs to give up her vietnamese passport. Can we still purchase real estate in Vietnam although none of us will be vietnamese citizenship? If we buy a property before she changes her nationality, will it have any legal consequences regarding the property?\n \nWhat are some recommended webpages to look for properties (south Vietnam, Saigon, Da Lat) online? (vietnamese only is fine)\n \nIs there any kind of public accessible data about average prices per square meter for different regions across the south of Vietnam?\n \nIs it common in Vietnam to hire an agent when buying a property which does the searching for us and asks for a reasonable commission? How would we go about finding someone professional?We are not searching for and cannot afford a luxury property. E.g. I doubt we can afford something in downtown Saigon.\n \nAny other obvious pitfalls that we should know of? I know that we are very much at the beginning of the process and we are both pretty clueless. I'm more of the \"handyman\" in the relationship but unfortunately I do not speak vietnamese yet and it's hard for me to research by myself.

Here in Dalat some of them seem to operate even in the middle of the day. Even the staff at my hostel do it (none of the guests seem to participate). This isn't just for a couple hours in the evening either, they seem to enjoy doing it constantly from 6pm to 10pm. 4 hours of this shit?

          "description": "I am a Vietnamese-American who traveled to Vietnam to see my family and I happened to meet a girl at a spa on my last day in Vietnam. (It was at a highly rated spa with legit services)\n I thought she was attractive so I started up a conversation to get to know her and she said she didn’t have a boyfriend. I got her instagram and we started to talk for a month. She was very enthusiastic (never one word answers) and flirty with all her responses except I always had to start all the conversations. I recently told her I was really interested in her but that it would be difficult for us to maintain a relationship being so far away from each other and she said she was interested too and that if we “really loved” then it would work. \n However, I went through her instagram followers and found her boyfriend that she has been dating for like 9 months. She doesn’t have any photos of him on her instagram but the boyfriend has all the photos of her on his profile. \n After finding out, I didn’t confront her about it and immediately stopped messaging her and she hasn’t messaged me either but that wasn’t surprising to me because I was always the one to start the conversations. I guess I can understand why now because she has a boyfriend… Even though, we haven’t talked for a week, she still shows interest by liking my instagram stories.\n My question is why would she deceive me like this and waste all of my time? Was she ever actually interested in me?\n Part of me just wants to screenshot all the messages and send it to the boyfriend\n    submitted by    /u/Sn0wman3690  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I live away from my family for just 10 years. However, the relationship between me and my parents was never good. I am close with my sister and my niece but the last time I saw them was 7 years ago. To be fair, we are all different people now. Although we text, call, talking in person is still another thing. \n I left the country for education, for work but I also wanted to stay away from my family. Just typical Asian parents problems. Since moving away from them, our relationship got somewhat better, just because I don’t have to deal with bullshit anymore.\n I tried to put a smile on my face, I told my self that they will just stay for 1 month, I will be okay. But just 30 mins and I already felt depressed. It started with they filming me the second they saw me at the airport, shared it on Facebook and Tiktok, then with them trying to “help” me. Then they took off their shoes and put their feet on another seat when we were on public transport. I understand their motives, I just couldn’t stand it. The things they talk about, I can’t join. The things they do, I am not comfortable to. The cultural difference between us is big enough to keep us apart.\n I am worried that this trip will push me and my family away even further. 27 more days to go, and I don’t know how I should approach it.\n    submitted by    /u/aliceito  \n [link]   [comments]",
