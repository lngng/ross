All sorted on the places to go and things to do, but I really wanted suggestions about the food to eat and the places to eat it from \n I know this is very wide and vague, but I want to try all the local dishes and really sample as much of the Vietnamese cuisine as I can because I don't know if I'll come back to this beautiful country. \n Any suggestions about the joints/ restaurants to check out would be appreciated, along with the regional dishes to try. I understand a lot of Vietnamese food is street food so if you guys even recommend the streets/ markets to go to in these cities to sample the local fare, would love that. \n Specially looking to try as much coffee, noodles, rolls as I can!\n    submitted by    /u/Gold-Mushroom3152  \n [link]   [comments]",

Does anyone know if there is rabies on Cat Ba Island? And also does anyone know if the situation I described is enough to transmit rabies? I’m currently heading to Ha Giang so will be away from any vaccination clinic.

I have heard about floods during the month of November but would they happen in December too? What are the chances? And which areas might be affected if there are floods in December (first week)?\n I have two options. 1. Visit Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue from 28th November to 2nd December OR 2. Visit Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue from 2nd December to 6th December\n Which would you suggest? \n Appreciate your help a lot.\n Thanks a ton :)\n    submitted by    /u/yipra97  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I speculated an alternate lore (short) where North Vietnam instantly invaded (or special military campaign\" in Laos to weaken the Western-dominated \"American\" alliance influence in Southeast Asia. Had Pathet Laos toppled the corrupted Vientiane government either in 1963 or 1964, then South Vietnam faced a peril where the newly communist Laos government planned to infiltrate Central Vietnam (South Vietnam) to prevent largely American forces gained on foothold across Central Highlands.\n Another POD is both Vietnams divided at the 16th Parallel (leaving Da Nang and southern branch of Thu Bon River under North Vietnam side). It would create massive chaos in Laos where communist North Vietnam easily determined to aid Pathet Laos to \"liberate\" Vientiane around early 1964 or 1965 (or even before 1968 Tet Offensive) depending on American military moodiness. North Vietnamese General Giap would like to see the size of NVA forces to orchestrate the moderately launched assaults of several Laotian towns and villages near the Vietnam-Laos border.\n With Laos under a \"socialist\" Vietnamese client state (regardless if Vietnam divided in 17th Parallel as per OTL or alternatively divided at 16th parallel), South Vietnam could faced intensified harassment from largely local \"VC\" communist forces near the South Vietnam-Laos border and even near provincial capitals in Central Highlands. This would lead the American government to seek peace talks with North Vietnam and Soviet Union secretly in a third country. If successful peace talks in mid-1960s, American could be saved up to 30,000 American soldiers and even save largely funds to fight against poverty in the domestic U.S. I generalized a possibly no Nixon as President of U.S in 1969.\n Can you think about ideas that devastated South Vietnam?\n    submitted by    /u/Thick_Broker6931  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have done HaLong Bay already so this time we are thinking about Lan Ha Bay. I think it makes sense to fly into Cat Bai Airport (HPH) and do a 3 day night night cruise. And then bus back to Hanoi. \n Should we stay in Haiphong for a night before cruise?\n There are so many cruise options, does anyone have a preferred option? We are obviously going for the honeymoon vibe. \n Some options we are seeing for cruise include:\n Ylang by Heritage Cruise Line\n Perla Dawn Sails\n V’Spirit Premier Cruise\n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/Double_O_Sullivan  \n [link]   [comments]",

I love Southeast Asia and want to stay, but Saigon has ridiculous real estate pricing and interest rates on house loans. Also, crazy pricing for international schools, crazy traffic etc. So I've done some research and see many foreigners who moved to Malaysia and they seem to really love it. KL/Penang seem very developed with good public transportation, great real estate pricing even for luxury places, good mortgage rates, good tax situation for digital nomads, and international schools are cheap. Overall it seems like a clear upgrade over many aspects of Saigon (don't hate me for saying this, I honestly don't know, just read online).\n For some reason though my wife is not down with this idea. She doesn't like Malaysia and the culture there. I'm wondering what other Vietnamese people think of Malaysia and Malaysian culture?

          "description": "In the current debate surrounding Affirmative Action, many people evoke \"the poor Vietnamese who are uneducated and therefore need affirmative action\". First off, most schools don't consider the difference between South East Asians and East Asians. Secondly, statistics paint a different picture. Look at this table from Pew Research:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pik9p1w0h0y91.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=87eee2b83401f3d4349b212c79251d00db52dc14\n As you can see, Vietnamese born abroad, that is, the refugees, have low educational attainment. But for the generation that was born here, educational attainment is higher than whites. This, of course, contradicts the liberal narrative that Asians are doing better because of higher socio-economic status. Yes, they are correct -- many Vietnamese came to the US poor and without much education. But their children perform better than white Americans.\n The same story is told with income:\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/pocewmi4h0y91.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=4830d089be09f22dccae7fe3c065106b16ddc751\n So, pro-affirmative action advocates, stop using the Vietnamese as your token Asian minority to disguise your Asian racism.

Thank you!\n I love this food YT channel based in Vietnam for going to visit the tribes around the world.

I’m visiting for the first time in nearly five years next year and I want to work on my Vietnamese. I learned a small amount from my mom growing up (she worked long hours and did not have much free time) but I otherwise grew up isolated from other Vietnamese people. I’ve tried a few app/services and I’m currently using Duolingo. I am aware, however, of how specific the Hue dialect is, and I’m worried that I’m learning bad habits and potentially making myself even more unintelligible to my relatives. Does anyone know of any services that specifically teach the Hue dialect?

          "description": "Last week while I was travelling through Vietnam, I was going to fly from Hanoi to Hue and had a flight at 8PM. However, Vietjet decided to change my flight for 10AM of the same day. First of all, I had never seen any airline bring forward a flight before. Secondly, they refused to refund me the entire amount, and the only solution offered was a \"creditshell\", which is a credit I can use for future flights with them. Now that I'm back from vacations and can afford to lose some time with this, I wanted to ask if anyone had any success obtaining a full refund from them for a similar situation, or if this is a lost cause and I should just forget about the 70$ I paid.

Now I’ve read a lot of writings where it is pointed out that MSG/bột ngọt aversion is originated from a 1968 racist research in USA. For me that explains why the western world is on the err side when it comes to MSG. \n Still I don’t really know why a lot of Vietnamese, my parents, people of their age, my age, and younger (Gen Z) is still very skeptical with MSG. They:\n  \n Makes an effort to avoid eateries/restaurants that they perceive to be using too much MSG\n  Claims that they’re nauseous or having headaches when consuming too much or any MSG at all\n  Avoid using MSG in their cooking\n  \nI do find 2-3 to be quite funny because Vietnamese are still using a lot of stock powder/bột nêm which is basically flavored MSG. \n Is there any knowledge for where this MSG aversion in Vietnam originates? Is it because of the 1968 study that carries to Vietnam during the war and persists thereafter? Do you experience 1 and 2 yourself?

It's super lovely and the people are really nice, some of the cutest super lovely people I've met. But I can't walk down the street without people on their scooters stopping asking me for a ride, people selling glasses, chips, paintings, bracelets, necklaces, tours and private car tours. I get people have to make a living. Which is totally understandable. It's probably more a culture shock to me than anything. I can't walk down the beach without being asked by people every 40 meters I walk if I want to buy their things and knickknacks. It's gotten to a point where I'm starting to feel rude to these people.\n But they also can't take no for an answer and are really really pushy and persistent. What are some ways to get your message across that I don't want to buy without being super rude or guilt tripped into buying?

While traveling through Vietnam I am making a video about my trip and I am personally very interested in the fishing traditions of the Vietnamese. When traveling I really value meeting with locals and properly experiencing the places I visit rather than going through the regular tourist route.\n I’m posting to see if there is anyone in the Cat Ba/ Local bay areas that would be willing to show me and my film partner the local experience for a few days. I would love to learn about traditions, see how people in the area have lived, meet families, and fish! It would be amazing to have someone who can translate as I love to interact with local people but am limited by only speaking English.\n The person would need to be okay with being on camera and would definitely get some beautiful photos of them on the adventure!\n Edit: when I say local guide, I do not necessarily mean a tour guide. I am looking more for a local who is interested in making some new friends and wants to show off and educate about the Vietnamese culture\n    submitted by    /u/Ragingcrustacean  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did change my Google Play account to Canadian to install a few apps there (I cannot change it back within this year).\n Yesterday I realized all the limitation is applied on my app as if it's Canadian and they offer me to try the Super thing with CAD currency. I am wondering if it's just somehow use Google Play account as location now or is it the new policy in Vietnam?

Mình có thể xin những lời khuyên của các đàn anh đi trước và các bạn kiểu nên lựa chọn mặt hàng kinh doanh nào không ạ, vì mình biết chắc mình chỉ có một thân một mình không ai hỗ trợ nên cơ hội của mình cần phải cẩn thận không là gục luôn 🥲 mình có định hướng là sẽ mở 1 shop bán phụ kiện 420 ở tại gia vì mình cảm thấy có thể phát triển được vì tại địa phương nơi mình sinh sống chưa có mặt hàng này nhưng cũng đang đắng đo lắm, nên mình cần tham khảo thêm ý kiến của các anh các bạn để có thêm định hướng và những kế hoạch duy trì cho kinh tế cá nhân để nuôi gia đình mình ạ 🥰 cảm ơn các bác đã đọc\n    submitted by    /u/bat420vn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't know to you guys from other countries, do you guys do this? In my opinion, they are really too expensive and wasteful, why spend hundreds of thousands of dong just to wash a pair of shoes when you can do it yourself at home.

          "description": "Hey all! Xin chào! I’m currently on my 3rd one month visa to Vietnam and I love this country so so much that I’m wanting to make it my home base as I travel the world. Between the people, the scenery, the food, culture and vibrancy it is just completely in a league of its own. \n So fucking gorgeous. My question is - I’ve had 3 one month visas issues already (only one in my current passport? If that makes a difference) in the past 4 years. Next year I would be hoping to get a 3 month visa and obviously more again as I come back. Is there a limit to how many times I can leave and return before immigration start asking questions? \n My current visa expires on the 6th November, I would like to go to South Korea for Halloween and come back but then I’d be on my 4th visa since 2018. Is it wiser to finish my time here and limit the amount of re-entries to this gorgeous country? Or am I overthinking!!?? \n Thank you!

We are renting motorbikes from Tigit and plan on first traveling north and doing the Ha Giang loop, then traveling south along the country towards HCMC. The Honda Winner is 200 dollars less from Tigit and I have read that they are more common and easier to have repaired. I have also read that the XR is comfortable and it seems like it would be better adapted for rough terrain. We are both well experienced with riding motorcycles; however, it is our first time in Vietnam and I understand how different it is. Taking the price difference into account, does anyone have any advice on which bike we should rent? \n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/bscottunit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I live in UK so I mostly use British pounds and I pay with card in most places. \n From what I read, I should have cash because in many places only cash is accepted. What is the best way to manage money as a tourist? I was thinking about the following:\n 1)bring cash (USD, would GBP be accepted at a decent rate ?) and then exchange it for the Dong once I am there\n 2)bring only a minimum amount in USD just to have money if needed and then withdraw money in local currency from an ATM. Are there ATMs often? Do they charge huge fees? \n I will backpack most of the trip so I would prefer to withdraw only a small amount of money at the time, I don't feel comfortable to have the money of two weeks of travel on me.\n    submitted by    /u/AcanthisittaSweaty16  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When you order a grab to the airport they may purposely take you to the wrong place. Then a taxi driver will explain that you are at wrong place and ask for a high price to go to correct place.\n My story: I told my initial grab driver i was at wrong place and after a few times of telling him it was wrong. He drove me to correct place reluctantly. I even tipped him.. I asked a security at correct place if it was in fact correct as i was second guessing myself. He was apparently working with them and told me to go ask someone at back. There were just more more grab drivers there. I was confused but i also didn’t want to be late. At this point I wasn’t aware of the scam and thought it was just a misunderstanding.\n New grab driver asked to pay to go to the initial wrong place saying it was the correct after i told him where i was going. Asks for stupid price once we arrived too. Thats when i detected a scam. But it was too late. Arrive there and thats when the taxi driver attempted to ‘help me’ (scam me) and drop off at correct place. And he will ask for money in us dollars. \n Overall the scam wasn’t much in my currency. But i was so angry at the situation that i left the taxi without paying and told him to F off. This proved to work as he barely even chased. Probably because the security working inside the airport werent involved in the scam like the outside security was.\n My advice: act angry and dont back down. It worked for me as i was legitimately pretty angry at how they were fucking with me and risking missing my flight and losing a lot of actual $\n    submitted by    /u/Garnservo97  \n [link]   [comments]",

We were thinking of buying motorbikes in the north, and riding from Hanoi to Saigon. \n The only thing is, my two friends don't have a driving license (no car, scooter, or motor) and have none or barely any driving experience, not even in the European country I'm from.\n I do have a driving license for a car and a scooter for some years (not for a motorbike) and would consider myself an experienced/good driver, but even I am quite hesitant about riding a motorbike in Vietnam. The odds for two (if i count myself in three) totally inexperienced motorcycle drivers to get into any kind of accident when riding in Vietnam for a month seem higher than acceptable to me.\n On top of that I'm worried about my friends, I don't want to see them in a serious accident in Vietnam, far away from home and without any insurance. \n They just shrugg it off and say it'll be alright and tell me I shouldn't worry about it. They don't seem to understand the risks. \n Are my concerns justified? I know it's almost impossible to go to Vietnam and not ride a motorbike, but I want them to at least understand the dangers and risks.\n    submitted by    /u/Exotic_Bandicoot_639  \n [link]   [comments]",

Been trying to get back to my roots and understand the culture better by consuming more Vietnamese modern media.\n There's a game show I watch called 2 Ngày 1 Đêm. Originally I enjoyed the show enough, but over the last few episodes, the show's use of live animals just doesn't sit quite right with me.\n First it was a game to capture duck. Then another game where they toss a whole bunch of mini crabs around to find special ones with numbers stuck to them. But the worst one was in the final episode where they were pulling this poor baby pig around, not with a proper pet harness, but just a piece of rope, then the poor thing got picked up and run around whilst screaming in distress. The sounds of his scream honestly stresses me out.\n Having grown up in Vietnam, I know we still have a long way to go in terms of animal rights, but I did not expect to see animal abuse on national television. Honestly I wonder what other people would think when seeing this on Vietnamese TV. This particular show originates from Korea. The Korean show has hundreds of episodes and animal abuse was never in any of them. How is it that the Vietnamese show cannot produce even 20 episodes without involving distressed live animals, do the producers lack creativity that badly? 😔\n    submitted by    /u/GinkandTonic  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some rural people believe that the head of a virgin girl is very valuable and may be conserved and turned into the most powerful and omnipotent talisman through special ceremonies. Persons who have the talisman are believed to be omnipotent and invulnerable.\" \n I found that really intriguing but couldn't find anything else referencing that belief online. Has anyone heard of this, or anything related? And are there any keywords that might help me research further? I'm also curious what they mean by 'rural people' here...\n Cảm ơn!\n    submitted by    /u/ggggblue  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just wonder if anyone else noticed something similar. \n I’ve traveled between HCM and Hanoi a lot this summer and have never had any problems with the food, however yesterday was awful at multiple places. I wonder if there is some airport-wide issue that’s happened recently or if yesterday was just a lot of bad luck. \n Many VN airports have a Lucky Star Cafe and I usually get a sandwich from there. They have the sandwiches on display in a window and you pick one, they take it out and heat it, and hand it over. At Hanoi airport yesterday, I looked at one cafe and all the meat looked super dried out, as if it had been sitting at room temp for hours, or even more than a day. All the meat on all the sandwiches looked like that. I decided to try another location of Lucky Star — same thing: dry, discolored looking meat. I decided to order Burger King instead because it was right next to me and because at least that food is cooked when you order it. \n The BK fried chicken sandwich was utter shite! It looked like it had been fried at too high of a temperature for not a long time. It looked like a burned brick on the outside and the inside was cold mush. I had to spit it out as soon as I took a bite and I just left. I didn’t even want to try anything else. I am aware I should not have high quality expectations for fast food but it should at least be edible. \n I got a bottle of water from a third Lucky Star location and all the sandwiches there looked the same as the first two. I just decided not to try anything else at the airport. \n I know this could be a huge coincidence, but maybe there is a wider issue? Is there some electricity issue fucking with the food equipment? Has there been so little traffic that they haven’t moved their products? This is the only time I’ve had bad food at the airport so it just seemed weird that four different places had food issues. What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/Lamourtattend  \n [link]   [comments]",

Him and I would basically fly off a boat and pass off coordinates to the boat we were on whenever we saw large schools of tuna fish. This was basically daily for a year. But he speaks very limited English, good Chinese, and native Vietnamese. I speak vocational Chinese, zero Vietnamese, and native English. Nonetheless, we got along great. We trusted each other enough to venture thousands of miles away from land and 40 miles away from our boat in a small aircraft. When we got back I would relax and he would continue to work his ass off because I am from privilege and he is not. He has a 3 year contract away from his family. I have a 1 year contract.…",

From what I have read about FULRO is that they are considered to be a collation of other political ethnic minorities groups, most of them were Chams Hindus and Muslims, Montagnards Christians, and Buddhist Khmer Krom.

          "description": "My significant other is the daughter of Vietnamese parents that moved to Japan as refugees. The problem is: even though she was born and raised in Japan, Japan does not recognize her as a citizen. The only way for her to receive citizenship in Japan is to work for 3+ years as an office lady and pay the government X amount of taxes. \n We aren't doing that, and recently I received a job in VN.\n Because she doesn't have a passport or citizenship anywhere in the world, her visa status will likely be a little difficult to navigate (she has a special visa that allows her to visit Vietnam for 6 month periods but requires her to return to Japan). \n Has anyone here been in a similar situation? \n She knows that she won't apply for Japanese citizenship (and has little desire to now). So, how difficult would it be for her to apply for Vietnamese citizenship? \n She speaks Vietnamese fluently and has a Vietnamese name, if that makes a difference.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/yesimforeign  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm an English 27 y/o female living in London. I have a 1st class Fine Art degree and currently studying a PGCE in secondary art and design (post graduate that qualifies me to teach full British GCSE art and design curriculum and A-level). I have teaching experience in art and geography. I recently started a beginners Vietnamese course with SOAS. \n I was preparing to move to Vietnam to teach English and COVID hit, which pressed me to study my post grad and become an art teacher.\n I want to live the rest of my 20s and onwards in a beautiful exciting country, to immerse myself in a new culture, learn a new language, to grow and truly live. I want to really take some time to move to a country to study to make my best attempt at learning the language, meeting new people and also to rent a studio to have the time to develop my art practice. \n Here in UK I'm seasonally depressed 6 months of the year, overworked to afford to get by and uninspired and to be honest I've always felt this way about life here. \n The reason I chose to study to become an art teacher is in some desperate hope that I might be able to utilise these skills and find work in an international school abroad as a British curriculum art teacher or gain a residency visa back to Australia (closer to Vietnam at least). Don't get me wrong I do love working with young people.\n Working as an art teacher in London is something like £35k a year. But honestly I'd take a sickening pay cut to move and have more time to truly live. International schools in vn seem few and far between that need art teachers. I would obviously very much love to keep progressing with my art related career, as it's my specialism and love but I would consider teaching English if It means I have more time off and have enough money to work on my art and take Vietnamese lessons. \n Thoughts anyone? What kinds of jobs/hours/pay What do you think my prospects will look like if I move to Vietnam. 🇻🇳🍵\n    submitted by    /u/onomebunbun  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am doing it all online through a university that is outside of Vietnam. 2021 I got an online job that allowed me to get through covid times. My employment contract there ends at the end of January 2023.\n Having worked from home for the last two years, my Vietnamese skills have diminished a lot, and they weren't that good to begin with. \n I have a year until my university degree is finished and I then plan to reenter the workforce, but until then, I have two options: return to my extremely expensive home country where I will need to finish my studies and work at the same time, due to cost of living OR continue my online studies here while also studying Vietnamese.\n My online studies are in a field that I am already quite knowledgeable in, so I am kind of bored to be honest. And on top of that, I have a lot of free time. So I would much prefer to stay here and study Vietnamese and live off of the savings for a year before returning to work.\n The last point to add, my fiancée (also a foreign national) and I are getting married, so I could return once that paperwork is finished but her countries government makes that of Vietnam look like a well oiled machine, so I don't want to rely on that. \n TLDR: I have a year off and would prefer to stay in Vietnam to study than go home to my home country.

Not aggressive. It was sitting by a store and looked healthy & clean, but had no collar on it.\n The scratch didn’t visually bleed and I don’t see broken skin, but it left a white line (like when you scratch your own arm with your nail). The dog also licked my leg (no visible open wounds, but I had shaved that morning so you never know).\n Do I need to get post exposure rabies shots, or am I being paranoid?

I am coming in to DN first.\n However, I just noticed that it is the rainy season & i didn't expect Hoi An/DN/Hue to be flooded that badly. As you can see my past post history, others have mentioned that the flood generally come and go quickly and 99% of the cities/ tourist spot are still accessible.\n After seeing the news on DN/Hue ytd and today, I am even more worried and really need some advice here from the viet community. (I have done my research online and reddits alrdy to prevent overposting, but i really need some assurance and guidance. Hope my post doesnt get removed).\n ​\n Q1) How true is it that the flood doesnt impact 99% of the cities and tourist spot are generally accessible?\n Q2) If it rains heavily, How long does the flood takes to recede so that I can travel off?\n Usually, Are the railway trains station still accessible during floods?\n Q3) Even tho, it is hard to predict the likelyhood of floods, & I can still visit the 7-14days weather forecast. But if the city (DN/Hoi An/ Hue) has already flooded before, and the typhoon/storm heads somewhere else, are they still prone to flooding?\n Q4) Aside from weather forecast, what can i search on to warn myself of upcoming flood?\n Q4) Are the northern Vietnam safe from flooding? So i can change my plans?\n ​\n This is my first 20+ days trip to vietnam, and i really didn't foresee this coming. Appreciate many help\n    submitted by    /u/chammpionn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yes it got slightly out of hand and my budget grew.\n I work remotely and I’ve decided to try living in Vietnam longer term. I have a 5 year visa and I need to exit the country every 6 months which is fine because visit family and friends back home. \n  \n I am figuring out the right visa for me… Even though I can stay in the country for 6 months on a tourist visa. But I’m confused? \n  \nI want to rent a high rise serviced apartment with 2 rooms close to the center. Is US$600 per month enough? \n I don’t plan to party and drink (as much as I did last trip) and I’m more focused on really understanding the motherland. I want it to be more meaningful and I create real, lasting friendships. \n So I plan to budget US$500-800 for spending money for everything I need per month.\n I’m extremely interested in investing and entrepreneurship here in Vietnam. So I’d like to start a business here. \n I leave in December again. I’m getting travel insurance etc. visa, passport and everything renewed. \n Any tips are welcome!

Sometimes our volunteers provide the groceries. Sometimes people give us money and we do a grocery pickup for the case worker. \n Will you help me create a list of basics that they may want in their kitchen? Keep in mind that the food is limited in Walmart - for example, I can't get rice noodles most of the time, so food that can be substituted is important. They will have nothing in their kitchens and we can't provide everything so knowing what foods are more common/used more is better than having a big variety of things. Meats, grains, produce spices, condiments, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/PattyRain  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I see many myths perpetuated both here and in daily life. This happens with all languages (see endless arguments on YouTube about Tamil/Sanskrit/Chinese being 'the oldest language', a nonsensical notion).\n Some typical myths:\n - Vietnamese grammar is 'backwards' compared to English/other language of choice (or just difficult in general)\n - Vietnamese has many words/syllables/etc. with different meanings (making it difficult)\n - The Vietnamese writing system is difficult and 'needs' to be reformed\n Just off the top of my head, I have seen and heard these three very recently. If I sat down and thought/researched I could list many more.\n The problem is that none of these claims mean anything in isolation. Many words with different meanings---compared to what language? Difficult writing system---compared to what other writing systems? And where's the evidence? There is never or very rarely any evidence or standards of comparison given. As a linguist I could go into detail on these issues, but I'd rather see what other people have to say first.\n Now flame me and tell me why I'm wrong.\n    submitted by    /u/legatrixx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm back in Vietnam for a few months as a break and to attend my cousins wedding in late November. I was born in Vietnam but left at a very young age and a dual citizen of both countries. I've made the stupid mistake of applying for an ID which means now that my name is in the system and they've just called me up for a health checkup tomorrow for conscription in 2023 as I'm 23yo and the age of conscription is until you're 27 (as I've recently found out).\n Has anyone been through this before? Is there any way to get out of this since I'm a dual citizen or would I have to leave the country ASAP, I did enter on my Vietnamese Passport. My mum is convinced if they conscript me I'll lose my Australian citizenship.\n I'd really appreciate some advice or if anyone could recommend me a good lawyer in Hanoi regarding this matter, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/DragonXDT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Would love to know what are thoughts from different age groups of Vietnam locals about developing advanced economy, despite all the problems mentioned in different industry articles.\n My core part at work is a radical shift in commerce / production & supply chains with innovating incentives for companies, employees and end customers / consumers that adopts to clean tech driven supply chains; be it food, healthcare, renewables, electronics, FMCG, sales through new B2B, B2C channels, services, EVs etc.\n I personally love the creative designs from Vietnam that uses natural biofibers (bamboo, hyacinth etc.) & overall designs. They are at par with details from Japanese, Chinese, Thailand's creative arts - a mix of tradition, nature & modern.\n I also got surprised by recent developments & announcements by Vingroup EV making in US for US customers. & at the same time, I wonder why MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) of Vietnam are not gearing up faster at global stage. \n For example, I never see them at industrial trade shows of the West (US, EU) or even at the East (digital or physical attendance), even though products are pretty good & innovative. Lets say Amazon SEA summit in Singapore, there are zero Vietnamese companies / MSMEs.\n Few of them are on Alibaba, but finding other MSMEs is hard as Alibaba is not that connected with new development outside of China, and the restrictions etc. makes it more complicated. \n Also, few good points from my research are repeated in this article: on Vietnam + ASEAN region since most of our suppliers at work are looking at ASEAN countries for shifting their production from China.\n https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/Vietnam-s-battle-to-climb-the-global-value-chain\n    submitted by    /u/starlord_west  \n [link]   [comments]",

I now need to apply for a new passport, and I’ve read that you need to file a police report. \n I went to the police station nearest to the cinema, I had to Google translate and I got told to go to another police station. When I got to the other police station, the guy flat out refused to file a report for me which annoyed me.\n I’m at my wits ends I don’t know what to do. Can I apply for a new passport at the embassy without A police report?\n    submitted by    /u/SuccessfulWater2663  \n [link]   [comments]",
