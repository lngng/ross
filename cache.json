She is thinking of becoming Austrian citizen but unfortunately Austria doesn't allow dual citizenship, meaning she needs to give up her vietnamese passport. Can we still purchase real estate in Vietnam although none of us will be vietnamese citizenship? If we buy a property before she changes her nationality, will it have any legal consequences regarding the property?\n \nWhat are some recommended webpages to look for properties (south Vietnam, Saigon, Da Lat) online? (vietnamese only is fine)\n \nIs there any kind of public accessible data about average prices per square meter for different regions across the south of Vietnam?\n \nIs it common in Vietnam to hire an agent when buying a property which does the searching for us and asks for a reasonable commission? How would we go about finding someone professional?We are not searching for and cannot afford a luxury property. E.g. I doubt we can afford something in downtown Saigon.\n \nAny other obvious pitfalls that we should know of? I know that we are very much at the beginning of the process and we are both pretty clueless. I'm more of the \"handyman\" in the relationship but unfortunately I do not speak vietnamese yet and it's hard for me to research by myself.

Here in Dalat some of them seem to operate even in the middle of the day. Even the staff at my hostel do it (none of the guests seem to participate). This isn't just for a couple hours in the evening either, they seem to enjoy doing it constantly from 6pm to 10pm. 4 hours of this shit?

          "description": "I am a Vietnamese-American who traveled to Vietnam to see my family and I happened to meet a girl at a spa on my last day in Vietnam. (It was at a highly rated spa with legit services)\n I thought she was attractive so I started up a conversation to get to know her and she said she didn’t have a boyfriend. I got her instagram and we started to talk for a month. She was very enthusiastic (never one word answers) and flirty with all her responses except I always had to start all the conversations. I recently told her I was really interested in her but that it would be difficult for us to maintain a relationship being so far away from each other and she said she was interested too and that if we “really loved” then it would work. \n However, I went through her instagram followers and found her boyfriend that she has been dating for like 9 months. She doesn’t have any photos of him on her instagram but the boyfriend has all the photos of her on his profile. \n After finding out, I didn’t confront her about it and immediately stopped messaging her and she hasn’t messaged me either but that wasn’t surprising to me because I was always the one to start the conversations. I guess I can understand why now because she has a boyfriend… Even though, we haven’t talked for a week, she still shows interest by liking my instagram stories.\n My question is why would she deceive me like this and waste all of my time? Was she ever actually interested in me?\n Part of me just wants to screenshot all the messages and send it to the boyfriend\n    submitted by    /u/Sn0wman3690  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am close with my sister and my niece but the last time I saw them was 7 years ago. To be fair, we are all different people now. Although we text, call, talking in person is still another thing. \n I left the country for education, for work but I also wanted to stay away from my family. Just typical Asian parents problems. Since moving away from them, our relationship got somewhat better, just because I don’t have to deal with bullshit anymore.\n I tried to put a smile on my face, I told my self that they will just stay for 1 month, I will be okay. But just 30 mins and I already felt depressed. It started with they filming me the second they saw me at the airport, shared it on Facebook and Tiktok, then with them trying to “help” me. Then they took off their shoes and put their feet on another seat when we were on public transport. I understand their motives, I just couldn’t stand it. The things they talk about, I can’t join. The things they do, I am not comfortable to. The cultural difference between us is big enough to keep us apart.\n I am worried that this trip will push me and my family away even further. 27 more days to go, and I don’t know how I should approach it.\n    submitted by    /u/aliceito  \n [link]   [comments]",

My Vietnamese speaking abilities is very bare-bones and simple. As such, when I went back to Vietnam, it was quite easy to identify me as a Viet-Kieu the second I opened my mouth.\n Now this prompted some thought and curiosity within me. For the typical local Vietnamese person, is it possible to identify the country that the VK person is from based off of their speech pattern/accent?\n Furthermore, do foreigners from different countries have different accents when speaking Vietnamese? For example, in the US, there is a distinctive difference between Latinos speaking english, Asians speaking English, Europeans speaking English, etc. As well, within those groups, you have subtler differences too. Like the French accent is different than the UK English accent. Vietnamese people speaking English have a different sound to Japanese people speaking English.

          "description": "Im studying abroad in france and there’s a dish called “bobun” here, it’s very popular and is often the first thing people point to when vietnamese cuisine is brought up. However i started to wonder if it’s actually vietnamese or more “viet inspired.” It’s a relatively simple vermicelli salad with toppings like beef, egg rolls, veggies. Is it “authentic”? \n Both of my parents are from vietnam but i was born in america, so i wouldn’t say i was an expert on viet cuisine but i wondered if this is more of a fusion dish like orange chicken. My parents said they don’t know any dishes called just “bò bún” but that “bún thịt nướng” exists in VN for example. Does “bò bún” or anything like that exist in vietnam/vietnamese cuisine? if so what would be the closest to this dish?\n    submitted by    /u/pecanpolarbears  \n [link]   [comments]",

Case in point the earlier ‘satire’ post, and many comments defending rude behaviours. \n I don’t normally post or comment much, but the more I check out this subreddit the more I realise how terrible the mentality of the people in Vietnam is. \n As A Viet diaspora, I really wanted to be proud of my heritage and culture, but it is just so hard. I am sure many second generation overseas Viets have this feeling as well. \n Every time I see Vietnamese people from Vietnam while traveling overseas, the majority of them are extremely loud, oblivious to the people around them, and have terrible manners/ behaviours (eating with mouth open food flying everywhere like tf?). It is just so embarrassing every single time.\n Yes, Some polite behaviours are relative, however there is still a core set of behaviours that is consistent everywhere, such as, do not block the path, do not spit on the streets etc. One can’t just hide behind the concept of relativeness and ignore reality altogether. \n I am both sad and angry because I know the Vietnamese are capable, but they just refuse to change or listen to criticism.\n Edit: Future readers can observe the comments and judge for yourself.\n    submitted by    /u/lostyoungman2k  \n [link]   [comments]",

Bất cứ điều gì anh nói cũng sẽ được dùng để chống lại anh trước tòa. Anh có quyền có luật sư trước khi khai báo với cảnh sát và luật sư sẽ hiện diện khi cảnh sát thẩm vấn anh. Nếu anh không thể tìm được luật sư, anh sẽ được cung cấp một luật sư trước khi trả lời các câu hỏi. Anh có thể trả lời câu hỏi khi không có luật sư, nhưng anh vẫn có quyền ngưng trả lời bất cứ lúc nào để chờ sự có mặt của luật sư\".\n Điều này có nghĩa là không ai được phép cưỡng ép nghi phạm trả lời bất kỳ một câu hỏi nào khi không có mặt luật sư và trước khi ra toà thì nghi phạm cứ giữ im lặng thoải mái.\n Các quyền này là cơ bản trong nhân quyền và được áp dụng ở tất cả các quốc gia dân chủ. Theo tao nghiên cứu thì luật tố tụng hình sự Việt Nam không có điều nào thể hiện rõ những quyền này cả.

Trong lòng của tôi cũng rất là bực khi chơi game gặp phải mấy ông nội này nhưng mà tôi cũng nhận ra mình chỉ chơi game , chơi cho vui có gì đâu mà phải làm khó cho bản thân mình mà bực bội .Toxic có đầy ban cũng đâu hết được , quan trọng nhất là bản thân mình . Cứ chơi cho vui thôi , đừng để tâm mấy chuyện đó , cuối cùng nó cũng chỉ làm khó cho bản thân mình . Đôi khi người ta lỡ lời họ nói vậy hay họ thích gì họ nói đó . Đây là kinh nghiệm trong đời sống đừng để lòng mấy chuyện bực tức , cuối cùng mình là người gánh bệnh tật . \n    submitted by    /u/EitherTry1322  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I've been to Asia before and was in Hong Kong in april myself to visit my family along with my gf.\n I am wondering if I should be taking any preparations food wise , as I am aware that the food hygiene is not that great. I also don't want a repeat of what I experienced as a kid in HK 20 years ago (diarrhea and the shits and vomiting) lol. In my experience, it was herbs and ice water that gave me problems, but I was wondering if I should be more careful?\n Second question is -Im bringing a camera along with me for travels, but its quite an expensive camera. My girlfriend was discussing this with me and told me to be carefeul about it being snatched. Therefore I am wondering i should take extra precautions with getting a security strap thats securely anchored so that no body can just snatch it away from me.

Flex tí nhưng, ai cũng sẽ tưởng một đứa thế này thì lo quái gì. Em thành thật em khá lo về cái long run cho sự nghiệp. Em đang học tài chính vì nó hay và rộng nhưng em thật sự chưa biết cái gì phù hợp. Cái chính là ở đại học em chưa biết nên chú trọng cái gì ạ, em có thử tham gia các CLB nhưng failed. Em cũng muốn đi thi case nhưng chưa đủ kiến thức. Em còn định thưc tập nhưng chưa có công ty tuyển. Địng hướng của em đang định vào big3 consulting hay big4, em cũng khá muốn làm về data hay business analyst. Nhưng em lại thấy khá nản và yêu cầu rất cao kiểu em not good enough. Hiện tại em thực sự mê consulting và em cần một số lời khuyên để nổi bật ạ. Em thấy bản thân đang khá phai mờ, tại vì có quá nhiều cơ hội trên đại học và em không biết nên đầu tư vào đâu. Em thấy mình khá vô dụng, đại học nhiều người giỏi lắm nhưng em không biết học đến đó bằng cách nào huhu. Em không muốn 4 năm tuổi thơ mình chỉ có học, xong chơi, làm mấy công việc kiếm tiền qua ngày rồi bị đá ra ngoài xã hội loay hoay nhìn bạn bè phát triển.\n    submitted by    /u/Adventurous_Body2019  \n [link]   [comments]",

My wife is Vietnamese, I am American, and we live in Vietnam which is where my daughter was born. The birth certificate issue was due to us giving her a western name and no one here telling us you cannot do that and instead just rejecting the birth certificate. So we got that resolved and gave our daughter a Vietnamese name and now have her birth certificate so the next step is getting a passport so I can take them to meet my family in America.\n It has been atleast 6 months and no passport. The reason being is when we renamed my daughter we gave her my family name which is a single syllable 3 letter name. Previously it was my father in law's name who is divorced from my…",

Every single response is gonna help me a lot so I appreciate your effort and if you know anyone suitable please introduce to me. \n    submitted by    /u/DisasterSpiritual205  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nếu tòa quốc tế phán quyết đảo không phải của Trung Quốc nhưng của Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei,... thế thì khác nào từ mất đảo cho Trung Quốc đổi sang mất đảo cho 3 nước đó, chúng ta đâu có được cái gì?\n Hơn nữa, bây giờ thì Trung Quốc vẫn đang là bên vi phạm luật, Việt Nam vẫn còn mang tư cách nạn nhân bị lấn chiếm. Nếu đem ra kiện thì ngay lập tức 2 quần đảo sẽ không còn là của Việt Nam nữa, khi đó các hành động sử dụng khai thác 2 quần đảo của Việt Nam sẽ bị coi là lấn chiếm lãnh thổ của Brunei/Malaysia/Phillippines. Hiện tại 2 quần đảo hãy còn là vùng đang tranh chấp, chúng ta vẫn đang có 50 tiền đồn trên quần đảo Trường Sa, chẳng lẽ đi kiện để rồi mất trắng?\n Cho nên là đừng nghĩ quốc tế đang ủng hộ chúng ta. Trong cuộc chơi giữa các ông lớn với nhau thì chủ quyền của một nước nhỏ như Việt Nam chúng ta không là cái gì cả.

But dude was raving about not having to pay anything as in Vietnamese culture, the car is always at fault regardless of how the accident happened.\n The motorcyclist is also demanding cash via text now in compensation to fix his motorcycle, phone, and laptop (I exchanged phone numbers with him for my insurance claims). Damage is minor and i don't plan on paying him a single cent. Just curious if this mentality is common.\n A Vietnamese friend of mine told me that its often true simply because car drivers are perceived to be more financially capable to bear the costs, even if they're not at fault. If this is true, that's pretty messed up. \n Update: Motorcyclist is still trying to text and call me for cash. I suggested we settle this in the police station with my rear cam recording at hand. But he rejected. I'm starting to believe that this dude probably doesn't even have a license.\n    submitted by    /u/mojotarts  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I went into high school, as a reaction to dismal education on the history of the Vietnam war, I did a lot of reading on my own and was pretty surprised by how different it was to my parent's accounts. \n Of course I understood my parents went through unimaginable hardships during the war, I absolutely don't dismiss their personal experiences.

          "description": "I’ll be traveling to Vietnam in two weeks. I’ll be in Saigon, Da Nang/Hoi An, and Hanoi (and the surrounding area perhaps). I am not on a backpacker budget but I figure for most of the trip there is still no reason to spend anymore than like 1,000,000 VND (30-40 USD) a night because the rooms are nice enough at that price. \n But, this trip is somewhat of a celebration (just finished law school and took the bar) so at least once in the trip I would like to splurge, by Vietnamese standards, and get a really nice room. I guess like 3,500,000 VD (150 USD) a night. \n I was thinking this would be best done in Da Nang because it’s on the beach and it’ll will be a pretty relaxing part of my trip. It didn’t seem necessary to spend too much in Saigon because I’ll be out and about all day and basically just sleeping at the hotel. \n So, does this line of thinkingmake sense, and if so, can anyone recommend some more upscale places that you’ve had good experiences at? Would like a nice pool and bar area, good food, service, etc… \n Open to this stuff in Saigon and Hanoi as well just like I said, doesn’t seem as worth it as Da Nang but open to being proved wrong.

          "description": "I’m Vietnamese but born in Australia. Apologies for my ignorance but I need some perspective. My family said Vietnam dislike China and I want to get perspective from those who are living in VN atm. I’ll be visiting Vietnam in September for the first time with my husband. He is Malaysian Chinese who is also born in Australia. He has an Australian passport but his surname is very chinese. Will he get targeted for bribes at the airport? $20 is not much for us but it’s the principle. My dad said that they don’t usually target younger people but I saw a few people here mentioning that they do. I can’t wait to visit my motherland but a bit nervous as I don’t know what to expect.

Mỗi năm có hàng triệu người chết vì tai nạn giao thông, mà đa phần là do những nguyên nhân hoàn toàn có thể phòng tránh được. Mấy người vi phạm thì tức là đang tăng rủi ro tai nạn lên cho bản thân và người khác, đến lúc tai nạn tàn phế ra thì ai cứu, chỉ còn biết than trời chứ làm thế nào được?\n Thứ hai: Csgt ăn đút lót thì chính mấy người vi phạm là người đút lót, csgt lỗi 10 thì mấy người cũng lỗi 7-8. Giả sử bạn vi phạm, bị vẫy lại, thay vì xin ghi biên bản, nộp bằng lái nộp phạt, thì lại chọn đút lót cho csgt hứa em không sai nữa, và rồi về chửi là csgt ăn hối lộ? Mà nếu các ông nghĩ mình không sai bị ăn tiền láo thì làm mẹ biên bản đi cho nó chuẩn chứ rén à mà hối lộ? Khó hiểu? Xong giả sử gặp ông csgt chuẩn, nhất quyết không nhận hối lộ thì lại lên mạng cào phím nhà nước phạt lắm tiền hút máu dân à?\n Tất nhiên tôi không cổ vũ cho hành động ăn hối lộ của csgt, hai cái sai thì không làm nên một cái đúng. Chỉ là nếu mọi người có ghét csgt thì hãy tìm lý do khác như kiểu gặp mấy thằng cảnh sát hách dịch, thái độ hà hiếp dân chẳng hạn, chứ tự người vi phạm đút lót để cho qua chuyện mà giờ lại chửi csgt ăn tiền thì nó vô lý.\n P/s: bình thường thì \"thằng cảnh sát\", \"chó vàng\", \"pikachu\" nhưng lúc ăn nhậu hay vặn quá tay ga bị vẫy thì chìa mấy trăm ra gọi \"anh cảnh sát\" ngọt xớt :)\n    submitted by    /u/redditorspawnrandom  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got enough of a perspective.\n I don't follow the sub closely, but lately I can't help but notice the posts where the OP is really dumbfounded that a totally different Asian culture with a heavy history has it's ways in day-to-day life and views?\n To me it looks like the certain disdain and irritation as in \"Why you guys aren't like Bali, where the culture is all so westernized and easy for us to consume?\"\n It seems so natural for me that when facing a different culture and especially in a developing country I am very respectful and accepting of the way they are. Instead of being on a high moral ground and in a position of a consumer, I try to get to know the people, the culture and be thankful that I'm being welcomed to their home.\n UPD. Since people get confused about what I'm trying to say. There are things that are deeply rooted in the culture of a nation. That's the \"otherness\" that people may or may not appreciate, but that's unique to every culture.\n There are problems that arise from socio-economical background and are pretty common in Asia and all around the developing countries. Those are things no Vietnamese is proud of but we are on the track of dealing with them.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/farting_tomato  \n [link]   [comments]",

And some foreigners also eat with the putrid sound of wet mushy food smacking back and forth while eating with their mouth open.\n But I find it to be much more common here in Vietnam. \n To me, it's one of those sounds that rattle my insides. Similar to someone rubbing a balloon or scraping on a chalk board. \n I'm sitting at a coffee shop now and a couple just sat next to me and they are both mouth smacking their food for the past 10 minutes or so. Even putting my earbuds in and putting the volume high. I can still hear it\n I know others also find this sound irritating. And it's obvious that people are able to eat without opening their mouths all the way 500 times during a meal and showing everyone the visuals and sounds of the first steps of the human digestion process\n I don't say anything. I'm not being a Karen. But it's absolutely disgusting. Why don't friends say anything to these people? Or literally nobody cares and it's enjoyable to eat a meal with these people as they make some of the most unappetizing noises? Why so common here in Vietnam? Like, the louder you eat your food, the richer you are? It brings you good luck or something? \n Nasty noises from your mouth keep the ghosts away maybe? 👻\n    submitted by    /u/EastWestNS  \n [link]   [comments]",

For reference, I am European Australian while my partner was born and raised in Vietnam. Any children we have will most likely grow up in Australia, though will frequently visit Vietnam to see family. We want to choose a first name that can easily be used in both Australia and Vietnam.\n We have been looking into Western first names that when shortened also sound like a Vietnamese name (this would be their nickname and also what they are called when in Vietnam). For example:\n (F) Maia (shortened to Mai) / (F) Maysie (shortened to May) / (M) Vincent (shortened to Vinh).\n Do you guys think this is too weird? 😅 Can you think of any other names like this?\n Otherwise, we were thinking of using a Vietnamese first name that is easy for English speakers to pronounce. Does anyone have any ideas?\n Opinions and advice would be great, thank you 😊\n Edit: We are mostly struggling with male names, though recommendations for female names would also be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/This-Cheesecake-6864  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m curious about how family members show love in their daily life. \n I (30F) don’t remember the last time I gave my parents hugs or said “I love you” to them. I love them dearly, but it feels really awkward for me to say loving words or be affectionate toward them. \n In our nuclear family, we give each other big hugs and say “I love you” every single day. My kids would get very upset if I forgot to do those things before rushing to work. \n My parents at their 70s don’t sleep together anymore, and I never heard them say “I love you” to each other. I feel bad for them. I really wanna give my parents some support but there’s always an invisible wall between me and them that I find it so difficult to break. \n I wonder if my situation is typical in Vietnamese culture or is it just my family background? My parents rarely say sweet words, always try to suppress their feelings and emotions (except for anger and frustrations 😑).

          "description": "Having lived in Vietnam and other parts of asia for quite a while, there is one topic which is quite difficult to understand ; real estate and its pricing.\n My general observations to date :\n - Generally, land is highly sought after for both investment, speculation and living. They're seen as an appreciating asset. Prices are eyewateringly high in major urban centers by global standards. Value is not in the home on the land (often knocked down quickly), but rather in the land itself\n - Condominiums are depreciating assets ; as they age, new projects pop up, generally the price tends to go down over time. That said, there are those who hope to buy a project off-plan (eg. before it is built), and then resell it by the time it is competed hoping to make money (arguably also speculation)\n - Foreigners face restrictions (cannot own land without complicated workarounds), and for condominiums must buy from a specific pre-allocated set of units in certain projects, which stays below a threshold (I believe 49%). Then there's the leasehold structure of 50 years which may impact the sale-ability\n Would love to get input on whether this is right, what I've missed and what more there is to this.I still have lots of questions, such as :\n - Are vietnamese subject to the leasehold structure?\n -How firm ones individual rights are in the case the Govt plans some project that impacts ones residence?\n - To what extent is there predictability to the prices or if its just a FOMO (fear of missing out) speculation frenzy?- If condominiums generally depreciate, then is it really a worthwhile financial investment?\n -How are land prices set? is it wild west or is there a government appraisal / pricing process? if so, how come land prices even in fairly rural places are higher per square meter than for example, London?\n    submitted by    /u/throwback5971  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don’t know why this became the norm. It’s like they think that because we’re kid, we don’t have feelings and don’t feel sad when adult talk down on us and compared us to other people. I know that in Vietnamese culture, respecting adults is utmost important even when what they are doing is wrong, which is probably why it has been happening for so long. Just imagine asking them back “well why aren’t you as successful and better shape than Chu Ut? You had more time than me at being successful, why are you comparing me to other kids?” Definitely will get the stick for that haha.\n    submitted by    /u/tankhuu3018  \n [link]   [comments]",

DL is really not known for teaching you words in a logical order and often giving you weird starter examples but VN version is next-level to me. Sometimes it teaches certain really random words. Like starting with things like ong (bee) for Vietnamese. Mhh OK... Anyway, Indonesian is similar but it's still great for daily vocabulary practice :)\n But I wonder... Is this what I will have to learn to read for real? I seriously feel like Duolingo curriculum creators are fucking with you in the first few lessons. Like why would you pick the name of the main antagonist to be An, and then you have your first sentences to be stuff like An ăn anh ấy. I'm making this example up because I forgot the exact ones, but the early samples have something like this where it's just non-stop an's and as a beginner you're just like.... Mother of God LOL cmon bro.\n I feel like they legit put the most unfavorable sentences at the start to make you question if you want to learn the language O_o. I know that due to tones you can easily have many words that look the same but... It seems so unrealistic to me to have simple sentences in literally the beginner section and then teach something like \"Con cá cắn cái ca\"... I feel like they do this on purpose LMAO...

Strangely enough my children found the tip money slipped under their room door.\n Did the bellhop return it out of distaste that it was too little or any other reason? From what I can recall tipping is not mandatory and I thought that amount was better than nothing. Thoughts?\n *Edit: Thank you everyone for your input. I could understand it could be bc the tip came from my children and accepting it was against some moral code or out of pity. It also could be possible that he thought the tip was way too low; Ill never know unless I hear it from him.\n *It is very interesting to hear everyones opinion about tipping as well.

My wife and I have bought a lot of stuff but I was just reading on another Reddit page about how a lot of stuff you really don’t need to buy new and you can find the majority of what you need on “buy nothing” groups, especially since a lot of the stuff is used for such a short term that it’s still practically new anyways. \n I searched on Facebook hoping to find a local group like that in HCMC and…nothing. Can’t say I’m surprised tbh 😂 but then again, maybe I wasn’t looking hard enough? Please let me know if you are aware of a group like that for my area.

Although it’s nothing new at all that these internet celebs jump on any topic that promises to be generating clicks and views, it’s somehow still mind boggling to me that a Viet Kieu (from Germany) coming to Vietnam, rises to fame here, and then learning absolutely nothing about Vietnam’s history and touches a topic that’s highly sensitive here.

          "description": "I’m a Korean American expat based in South Korea the past 16 yrs. For the first time, my Korean native gf, her brother, and I visited Ho Chi Minh for a week July 22-28. I know the saying is visiting and living are two different things.. \n Nonetheless, we had a blast. Stayed in an Airbnb at Vinhomes Central Park and went to a good mix of touristy foodie spots many near Ben Thanh Market and to local spots around the city where we couldn’t use any English to order. \n We were quite surprised by the weather temperatures as we were expecting hot weather similar to Thailand but it was rather cool the entire time. It’s actually hotter and more humid in Korea right now.\n Never visited Bui Vien Walking street as my gf and I aren’t heavy party-goers or drinkers (I’m in my early 40’s and she’s in her late 30’s and we’ve had our fair share of debauchery in our 20’s and early 30’s). Her brother was keen on checking it out but we just never made it.\n The only thing I wish I was able to check out is the bjj/mma/combat sports scene as I’ve been training myself the last 9 yrs in Korea. Saw a few bjj gyms I wanted to check out but also didn’t want to be selfish and take away from the time I should be spending with my gf and her brother. Am curious as to what the scene is like in Vietnam if anyone that trains would care to share.\n Here are some photos of our trip as well. A bunch of the cliché touristy spots. I’m also a photographer so I prefer shooting with my dslr rather than a phone and edited the photos in my editing style which might not be the best or most realistic representation of the places. But these the ones I’ve shared to my sns. \n We absolutely loved Ho Chi Minh and are keen to visit Hanoi the next time we make it back.\n Been lurking in this sub the last week to gain insight into this fascinating country and would love to hear any and all experiences, both good and bad, from those actually living here if anyone cares to share.\n    submitted by    /u/pauljean613  \n [link]   [comments]",

My mom definitely intends on visiting for 3 weeks, and she asked me if I can request work off to go with her (for 2-3 weeks). I currently work at a ski resort, and February is our busiest time of the year. To be honest, I don’t really want to go. I feel uncomfortable staying with my family for various reasons; I would also be going from below freezing now in high elevation to a humid tropical climate, but most of all I always feel anxious around my Mom. I had also been talking about and planning a trip with my partner to go to Italy for a week in March, so I’m not even sure if I’d be allowed to take that much time off in such a short amount of time.

That said, I've lived in three other Asian countries prior to coming to Vietnam, but the attitude and behavior of the foreigners in online communities here are the worst I've seen, particularly on reddit and especially above all on Facebook, at least in the Ho Chi Minh City online communities.\n  \nIf you dare to mention one single thing you dislike about Vietnam (not even mentioning the many other things you DO like - and even if you do, you might get the following treatment) you get shouted at by other foreigners immediately telling you to just go home and calling you an entitled, colonizing, crybaby Westerner. Often these will be the most liked replies, particularly on Facebook.\n \nI've seen foreigners in online communities seriously defend things like littering, disobeying of traffic laws (Vietnam has a rather high rate of traffic fatalities), loud street karaoke at midnight, cutting in line, and other such things as just \"cultural relativism\" (as though littering isn't objectively bad for the environment - people ok reddit were honestly defending littering), often with a healthy dose of whataboutism and telling the person to go home. Again, these will often be the most liked replies.\n \nI've seen people posting on online communities asking about problems(ex: \"is it a problem when I've seen multiple cockroaches in my apartment in one week\") or simple questions like \"is the rain in October THAT bad?\" only to get bluntly called an idiot and mistreated. \n \n As said, I've lived in three other Asian countries and participated in their online communities, and the foreigners in Vietnam are seriously the worst I've seen on their discourse. Even the weebs in Japanese communities, who are quite the sight at times, are less toxic and that is really saying something.\n So, why is this such a problem?

I know that there are many restricted medications available without a script in some pharmacies but I really can’t afford to be without them and would love to know if there is a safe and more legit way to do this. \n I’m a little unsure about being able to access them and am worried it will impact my ability to stay for longer than 30-60 days at a time. I have prescriptions from home and while the law stipulates that I am only allowed to bring 7 days worth of this medication into the country/m- though I haven’t had issues with this previously.

I am studying how the American Cinema creates stereotypes and misjudges vietnamise culture by making bad/unreal representations of VietNam. Although, I am not vietnamese and I'm having lots of problems in identifying the cultural aspects that are bad represented, like clothes, accents and other specific things as well. \n Is there any vietnamese cinephile that already watched American movies in this subreddit? I'd like to make some questions!!\n At the same time, books, articles and everything else that could help me dive into the VietNam culture or the American War in Vietnamese perspective would be nice to know. Any recommendations?\n Edit: The movies I am studying are: Green-Berets (1968), The Deer Hunter (1978), Apocalypse Now (1979), Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987), Good Morning Vietnam (1988), Casualties of War (1989).\n    submitted by    /u/herevin0  \n [link]   [comments]",

During my stay, I went on a trek led by a Hmong woman, and she shared some tips about how to support the local minority groups when traveling in this region. Here are the highlights:\n  \nDo your research when booking trekking expeditions. Most Sapa trekking companies are run by Vietnamese agencies that pay the local guides just a couple of dollars a day. We trekked with Sapa Sisters, which is owned and operated by Hmong women. The guides that lead Sapa Sisters treks receive half the profits from their treks as well as health insurance and paid maternal leave. Our guide said her dream is for everyone to get to work for Sapa Sisters, but for that to happen, they need more business. \n \nAlmost all hotels and hostels in Sapa town are owned by Vietnamese companies. To support the locals, consider staying at a homestay in one of the nearby villages. These are often run by families from one of the nearby minority groups. It is super easy to catch a taxi or motorbike to get to these homestays, and they really appreciate the business. Plus, the views and food are better further out from the city!\n \nTry to buy souvenirs directly from locals. The stuff in established shops in town is probably not handmade, anyways. \n \n Safe travels!\n    submitted by    /u/Icy-Emotion-7723  \n [link]   [comments]",

Facing world #1 and the back-to-back World Cup champions. The USA.\n Let's be honest, Vietnam was expected to get their butts kicked by the US. The 13-0 thrashing of Thailand in the 2019 World Cup wasn't out of the question.\n What ended as a 3-0 win by the US where Vietnam played very strong defensively, disrupted the US from many opportunities, and the goalkeeper also saved a penalty kick which was an awesome moment to watch.\n The joy on the face of the goalkeeper in this photo, and also the respect in the style of handshake she is offering the opponent after the loss. Something about this photo is just awesome. \n The faces of both Vietnamese players. Knowing they went up against the world #1. And although they didn't do the completely unexpected and pull out a victory. They did do the unexpected as they managed to keep the score very manageable and respectable. That locker room after the match probably felt like a victory party. There was not much to be disappointed about after that match.\n I hope to see them do well in their upcoming matches.

So why do people continue to drive so badly? I see people FaceTiming, eating Banh Mi, driving into people, running red lights, the list goes on.

          "description": "This r/place event shows how poor Vietnam's internet culture is when many Vietnamese first use a global, mixed-country social network. Most Vietnamese people only use Facebook or TikTok to chat with fellow countrymen in their community. So, like fish in a pond going to sea, some embarrassing aspects can be seen:\n Weird nationalism is most evident when a propaganda poster is the first choice of art to show Reddit about our country. There's nothing wrong with wanting to show sovereignty, but this event isn't the place to do it. So among various creative artworks, the propaganda poster appears very out of place. We could've drawn cultures, buildings, or famous people instead. If you use Facebook a lot, you can also see for yourself how obsessed Vietnamese are with nationalism.\n Facebook doesn't have a clear upvote and downvote system like Reddit, so many Vietnamese people who only use Facebook have the habit of commenting mindlessly in their own way and get downvoted straight away as a result when they comment on Reddit. That illustrates how poor their reasoning and chatting skills are.\n Vietnamese Facebookers and tiktokers tend to follow the crowd and blame others. When the Vietnamese artwork expanded, there were thousands of copy-paste comments with empty apologies and blaming an unknown third party. But without doing anything to fix it, the affected communities have to do it themselves. They only care to save their faces to feel good while doing nothing.\n As a Vietnamese person myself, I used to use Facebook a lot in the past, but nowadays I barely use it because of the terrible internet culture in Vietnam. After finding out about Reddit, I find it a much better social media platform for entertainment and discussion. Engaging in Vietnamese Facebook posts is just really frustrating to me.\n    submitted by    /u/penguinhunter204  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have come up with several activities to accommodate the kids as many of them have either physical or mental disabilities.\n One of the ideas that I proposed which got the go ahead was to play some songs on the recorder for the kids. I heard that music can be very engaging towards those that have mental disabilities. Some advice that I received was to pick songs that would be familiar to the kids so that they could enjoy it.\n So is there any song recommendations that the kids would know? Vietnamese nursery rhymes? Anything along that vein? Although I do have a musical background I have not touched the recorder in quite a while. So songs that might be too complicated would be a no go HAHA.\n Anyways thanks for reading, have a great day!\n    submitted by    /u/DrTRedstone  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead, groups that boast about achievements, offer humor, or criticize celebrities tend to gain significant traction. This has always piqued my curiosity, as finding groups that genuinely provide valuable knowledge is a rarity.

          "description": "I think this is the problem that some of us are facing when having typical Asian parents. The relationship between me (26) and my mom (65 years old) is really bad that we didn’t have a proper conversation for 10 years (+). It's not that she did anything wrong, it's just the age gap between us that makes us hard to understand each other. And the things she thoughts were good for me made me felt uncomfortable and pushed me further away from her. I wouldn’t go in details but I think we all understand what they are.\n I left the country when I was 16 years old and leave far away from her since then. But because of that reason, our relationship is getting better. I only came to visit once before Covid. And that visit turned out terrible. As soon as we spoke to each other, we fight. I then came to the conclusion that as long as I kept a safe distance from her, our relationship will be improved.\n I can tell that she is trying to fix our relationship in recent years. Every time she called me, she really tried to not say anything wrong or to upset me. The things she did wrong that hurt me, she no longer does. It's just the negative feelings toward her that already haunted me.\n I wanted to try, but the idea of speaking to her itself made me feel uncomfortable, not to mention the long quiet between us. \n In the last couple of years, I don't really find myself trying to improve the relationship anymore. I am happy without speaking to her, although I still endear her a lot. To make up for my neglect, I take care of her by sending money back to Vietnam. I understand that it's not enough. And as her child, I need to do more for her.\n But she is getting older, I know that any conversation I have with her could be the last one. I am too scared of the idea that I will regret not taking action sooner one day. However, I don’t know how to fix this and where to start with. My Vietnamese fellow, if you were in the same situation, could you give me some suggestions?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/aliceito  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've struggled and pulled through a lot, and I've been accepted to a very well-known university (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) in California for engineering (highly recruited and famous among all tech companies). \n My options were: UCSB, UCD, Cal Poly, and UCI. I chose Cal Poly. \n I can stay in America and make a lot of money, but my parents are getting old and I planned to live near them. I can write and speak in both Vietnamese and English, but I prefer English as my main language (writing in Vietnamese can be a struggle). \n Since, I have lived in America for so long, I'm not familiar with the job prospect in Vietnam. I hope to work for a foreign company in Vietnam that pay me well for my prestigious foreign degree and skills.\n Therefore, I need advice on what kind of engineering or degree would yield me the most job prospect in Vietnam. \n Options: Computer Engineering, Data Science & Statistics, Mechanical Engineering, or Business \n Any insights or combinations of degrees that would optimize my salary would be greatly appreciated. Any kind of experience or companies that I can focus to break into? \n I plan on getting an MS degree also.\n Please give me a reasonable salary range that I can expect to work in Vietnam for a foreign company.\n My parents live in HCM City. \n If you spend time reading all of this to understand my situation, I hope you know that I greatly appreciate your time.

Growing up, I remember tons of \"us vs. them\" stories and how the sound of northern accent can instantly put them (moms family) into an angry and aggressive mode. I never really gave it much thought because I'm American. I've only visited Vietnam twice years ago.\n Anyways I've lived in Japan for a few years and met a girl from Hanoi. I've never dated a Vietnamese girl before and honestly never thought I would. Conversation wise and personality wise, I think we get along quite well. It's funny because we have to communicate in Japanese, which is neither of our mother tongues. I'm now more motivated to improve my Vietnamese, and her English is making good progress too.\n We aren't dating officially, but both of us are definitely interested in next steps. We are both 30+ so I think we both recognize the need for discretion and caution, to respect each other's time, feelings, and limitations. I need to be in America for the time being so it would be long distance. \n My main concern is regarding potential culture clashes with her being from the north. I hate to say it but my family is so judgmental and can be blindly toxic. Im really worried how my mom would react. I know it's illogical and kinda racist behavior so before people attack my mother, please understand that she comes from war torn Vietnam and we have lost numerous family members during the war. They have serious trauma associated with the northern accent, and I would like to hear what others think and how their experiences have fared.\n Any thoughts, advice or discussion is welcome.

One thing my wife and I have always noticed, the coffee at these resorts is terrible. \n How can a resort that charges 1.7 mill a night make worse coffee than Ca Phe 123 I can find down some random street who only charges 25k? \n My wife says it's becuase the resort wants to make it for western customers, but a place like Vin Pearl has 90℅ Vietnamese guests. \n Like, go to any cafe with plastic tables and chairs and I would bet money their coffee will be better than a 5 star resort.

I noticed that there seem to be a lot of salty redditors on this sub who seem to think that all white expats in Vietnam are sex tourists, and dating the locals is an expression of \"attempting to quench their thirst for submissive Asian girls\". Pretty much every post here where an expat gets scammed by a bar girl has at least one or two redditors celebrating their misfortune.\n I don't see this attitude nearly so much in Taiwan. Nobody seems to have much of a problem with expats dating and marrying locals, and I seldom here any accusations of less than honorable motivations for doing so. \n Is it that Vietnam attracts a particularly unsavory variety of expat? Are Vietnamese men more xenophobic than their Taiwanese counterparts? Is this particular subreddit just a little bit more toxic than it's Taiwanese counterpart? \n Partially curious just for shits and giggles, but also trying to get a feel for what living in Vietnam would be like and the attitudes of locals towards expats in case the misses and I ever decide to relocate there.\n    submitted by    /u/daniel_orourke_mma  \n [link]   [comments]",
