You have 0 idea who was the fucker who added you there. You can't turn off that function where people add you to random group chat either.\n -\"Explore\"/\"Khám phá\" tab that is unable to be removed. The elderly who are not fluent with smartphones keep randomly subcribed for random shits in this tab. \n Edit: Forgot about this shit too: old files keep getting deleted. They are not even that old and you can't control it either. Can't increase or decrease the time where Zalo considers it to be old. -Suggestion of random people which I'm sure 90% don't give a shit about. Like if you wanted to add somebody as friend on Zalo, you usually take their numbers and add them. Not from suggestion. That's like the entire fucking point of Zalo: Phone numbers with a profile. It's the most useless shit ever and it has no right to be on \"message\" tab. Like Zalo is trying too fucking hard to become like Facebook or some shit.

Nhưng bắt đầu lên đầu C2 mẹ của em ấy có những hành vì động chạm vào những chỗ em ấy không thích trên cơ thể với tần suất rất thường xuyên, em ấy nhiều lần tỏ ra khó chịu thâm chí là vô tình đáp trả khi mẹ em ấy có những hành vi đó, nhưng đề bị mẹ em ấy cho ăn đòn thậm chí là chửi mắng thậm tệ.

We're staying from 30th Jan-12th February, coincidentally during Tet Holiday. \n  \nIs there a reliable website to buy train tickets in advance?\n Do the train stop at some cities so you can go outside and explore it during a short time between stops?\n Is it worth buying train tickets ASAP since it's Tet holiday soon?\n We're thinking of either staying in Hoi An one night and continuing the next day, is this something you would recommend or is going straight to HCMC?\n  \nThank you and looking forward to visiting your country! \n Bonus question:\n  \nIs it offensive if I wear those green short sleeved shirts older Vietnamese men wear as a mediterranean looking guy?

They handed me beer, food, rice wine, etc. We kept drinking for quite some time. There was also a bit of weed which they offered me and that I smoked.\n Eventually we go a bit further away, they said to listen to some music. We arrive at some small shop but there is no music. After that I say I am going home and I don't need help going home, I can walk. One of the guys insists I go with him on the scooter. Despite the language barrier, I understand it as if he will now drive me home, so I go with him. Instead we drive for a bit with me barely getting closer to my home and we get off at the center square of the city. We talk for a bit and I say I am walking home now, they suggest I take one of the nearby taxis. It feels a bit sketchy for me so I do not take a taxi and I tell the guys I will walk home. I start walking and with an uneasy feeling. There are not many people out at this time. I order a Grab and it arrives quite quick, then I eventually get back to my hotel safely.\n I am not sure what to think of this whole meeting. It should also be mentioned that I did not see anyone paying for the bill at the restaurant, and I got the impression that I was sort of expected to pay for it, since at one time the bill was placed in front of me. I never paid though.\n What do you think? Was I at risk of something happening?\n    submitted by    /u/nicotinecravings  \n [link]   [comments]",

Em hiện là sv năm 4, cbi ra trường của một trường khá có tiếng về ngoại ngữ ở hcm. Chuyên ngành của e thì lại k có tính áp dụng cao (thiên về chính trị), đa số quá trình học chủ yếu là chạy dl trên lý thuyết... Nên bây giờ gần ra trường nhưng em lại rất sợ vì không có chuyên môn. Sơ lược thì hiện tại em có Toeic 800+, Vstep B2, em đang có mục tiêu học Tiếng trung và trước khi tốt nghiệp có HSK3. Tuy nhiên, em không biết em phải đi theo con đường gì với những gì e đang có. Đa số bạn em theo Hr, e hướng nội + nhát gan k biết có nên theo không. Em cũng có định hướng theo logistic, và đang có ý định tìm job intern về những mảng này, nhưng chuyên môn em không có gì, ngành học k liên quan nên đa số k ai nhận. Các a chị cho e lời khuyên về con đường e nên theo với những thứ e đang có với ạ. Thời gian này em tiêu cực lắm, đôi khi e còn nghĩ về việc tồi tệ nhất... Nhà e cũng k khá giả, bame mắc nợ nhiều nên e k muốn bị thất nghiệp sau ra trường đâu ạ. Em hi vọng có người chỉ lối cho em vài tháng trước khi em tốt nghiệp ạ. Vài tháng này có thể sẽ thay đổi số phận 1 người được đó ạ 🥺. E bế tắc lắm, e mong có thể có 1 mentor cứu e về tương lai lẫn tinh thần hiện tại...\n    submitted by    /u/ilikejasminee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My dad who is now a viet kieu had brought a house years ago in Vietnam for his father and brother to live in. He had to change the ownership to his father since Vietnam doesn't allow viet kieu to own properties in the country. Unfortunately, a a few years after the dad passed away, the next person to have their name on the property is his brother and the brother promised my dad that he will give the house back to him later on when the time is right even though they didn't sign any contract because my dad naively believed in him. His brother is now dead and the ownership goes to his wife. My dad expected his sister in law to then rightfully transfer the ownership to him or even half of the house because the sister in law did help the family a lot while my dad was overseas, but she retorted back saying that my dad did not care about the family at all and had contributed nothing so he does not deserve any part of the house. We are going to sue her because we have the papers that prove that my dad did contribute a lot to that house and even my late grandpa acknowledged that in one of his old letters to my dad. The house in question is currently for rent as a business. My dad and I found a lawyer through connections and he said to stop my auntie from potentially selling it later, we must first block her from doing that by depositing 20% value of the house to the funds before the court trial since that's how the law works. Is that correct? I'm trying to find a new lawyer cause I don't trust this one and I see him as really incompetent. Pls tell me what I should do next.....\n    submitted by    /u/uwu_is_I  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "there’s an “asian american” accent i’ve heard people talking about, and i’ve always wondered about it. i don’t really know what it is, it’s not really an “accent”, but more an inflection or a manner of speaking that makes you instantly identify the speaker as having an asian background even though you can also tell they’re a native english speaker. even some of my friends who had english as a first language still have traces of this accent.\n i was born and raised in the US but i have a somewhat noticeable accent, cause my parents immigrated shortly before i was born and only spoke viet at home. tbh i’m grateful i don’t just know englsih and can speak viet (not fluently but conversationally) but sometimes it’s hard to speak english after a while living back with my parents lmao. for example some of my vowels and consonants sound viet. words like “cold” i might accidentally pronounced as “code” and “social” as “so sho”, “your” comes out as “yer.” it’s weird when i tell ppl about this bc they’re like “uhhhh weren’t you born in orange county…?” and i’m like “yeah lmao but my english still isn’t great🧐” i still speak english fluently but often it’s hard to express myself fully (without pausing) and pronouncing words that have sounds which don’t exist in VN \n does anyone else have this “accent”? how do you make it less noticeable?\n    submitted by    /u/espressolover90  \n [link]   [comments]",

No entrance fee but zero people at the basketball court. It looked nice though, I left immediately. -Sân Bóng Rổ CLB Ba Đình: Came at 5pm on Friday. Security at the facility main gate said they are fixing the court and it’s closed. Not sure I even went to the right place though. -The New Quarter (612 Đ.

          "description": "Our hostel warden gave us the worst possible experience just now. We have a booking for 4 of us and we had a friend drop by to our private room to use washroom facilities. The warden threw a hissy fit and started yelling and raising hell and gave us a very rough time. Plus, there was no way to properly explain to him that it was just a friend dropping by a bit, and not an escort - since he doesn’t understand english. \n He harasses us further by locking us in and not letting our friend out for about an hour. He then threatened to report us to police and demanded money to the tune of 30 million dong (which he said was to pay the cops). He also refused to get us the manager. We are all very shaken by this experience, and are quite convinced it wasn’t lawful at all. After he realised that he wasn’t getting a penny out of us, he calmed down after a bit and opened the shutters.\n What can we do about it?\n P.S: We’re in HCMC, and booked the hostel via Hostelworld.\n    submitted by    /u/sexybeluga  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm an American living and working in Hanoi. I'm trying to become more educated on Vietnamese table manners. This topic has been frustrating to me. My Vietnamese girlfriend and my Vietnamese friends have commented on some of my bad table manners. It's been difficult for me to try and change my eating habits. \n Here are some of the things I experienced:\n  \nVietnamese share their meals. My girlfriend told me that I should share food so I don't appear selfish. Usually in the US, my friends and I would just share an appetizer and then I would just eat the dish I ordered. I also had difficulty adjusting to this because I was concerned with hygiene. \n Vietnamese aren't so finicky with hygiene. My friends share food using the same chopsticks they eat with, and when I have beer with friends they handle the ice cubes with their hands. Surprising at first, but I don't make a fuss about it.\n I shouldn't accept food using my chopsticks when someone is offering food with their chopsticks. I just did this once, and people told me I shouldn't do it. I'm not sure why it is rude though. \n I shouldn't eat fast. My girlfriend told me it looks bad. I guess I eat fast, but for me it's my normal pace. I didn't have long lunch breaks in school/work in the US, so I guess that's why.\n I have to let old people eat first. I usually don't eat with older people, but I was told about this. I had food with a friend's family, and I didn't eat until her grandparents started eating. \n  \nI read a few more online, but I don't know what's true. For example, it's unlucky to flip a whole fish when eating. I have a Chinese uncle who that told me about that, but my girlfriend never heard of it.\n I hope I can receive some feedback and tips on improving my table manners. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/MopHai  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thế nhưng mới 2 tuần trước mẹ em lại bị diagnosed with ung thư tử cung giai đoạn cuối ạ. Gia đình em ngoài mẹ ra thì chỉ có nguồn thu nhập là ba em - là giáo viên nên lương ba cũng ko cao. Em thì vẫn ưu tiên việc chữa trị của mẹ nên việc du học ko thực hiện được thì vẫn ok. Nhưng về ngành mà em muốn học (Thiết kế đồ hoạ), thì cả gia đình em đều phản đối nếu học ở Việt Nam í, vì ngành đó ko phát triển ở đây. Ngoài ngành đó ra thì em thực sự không muốn hay đam mê học ngành nào khác. Em cũng chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến việc học ở Việt Nam... Nhưng rồi em cũng chỉ còn 5 tháng nữa để tốt nghiệp thôi ạ, nên cần quyết định càng sớm càng tốt i. \n Theo mn nghĩ thì em nên take gap year không ạ?

          "description": "I’ve been studying Vietnamese for about a month now and I’ve acquired some sentences and words. However, I did notice that there’s two dialects/accents to Vietnamese. When I look on TikTok I always see southern Vietnamese people talking about how the northern accent is complicated and sometimes hard to understand. But at the same time, most Vietnamese songs are written in the northern dialect and most apps only teach the Northern dialect. As a person who lives in the United States, I’ve seen sources state that most Vietnamese Americans speak with the southern dialect. Obviously I would want to make learning Vietnamese as easy as possible by learning the most commonly used dialect or easiest dialect to learn and understand. So this leads me to my question, should I learn the northern or southern dialect?\n    submitted by    /u/Blamoncy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all,\n ​\n My mates (foreigners) and my gf (Vietnamese) will tour Vietnam in February while she is visiting home for Tet.\n I am planning for an itinerary for Ha Long where I will arrive on the evening of 5th Feb and leave for Hanoi on the 8th of Feb in the early afternoon giving us a full day (7 Feb to plan day activities).\n We have an accommodation planned in Ha Long city for the days. Can anyone suggest if there can be some alternatives to cruise trips for the days that we are there? I have heard about some tours in Cat ba island but not sure how to choose them yet.\n I am looking to find alternatives to the Ha Long cruise for a few reasons - \n - My gf thinks it's dangerous and she doesn't want to go on an overnight cruise because she is just visiting there for photos(?)\n - Cruise may be a bit expensive for some of us. I am finding people suggesting against cheaper tours and so may have to look at something atleast upwards of $200 USD for an overnight tour.\n ​\n I am happy to receive any counterarguments and maybe I can convince my gf if there are some suggestions to go for it. \n Would anyone be able to suggest some tours or any day activities that can get us most of Ha Long/Cat Ba for the duration we are there?\n ​\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/prat33k__  \n [link]   [comments]",

I never knew I would like visiting Vietnam that much! \n I never thought I would want to visit Vietnam again, but now I want to visit every year or every other year if possible. I really enjoyed the food and the shopping, but wasn’t a big fan of the weather (I prefer cold and foggy weather). \n Maybe it’s because I was always comparing to U.S. prices, but everything was very cheap/affordable. Where I live, it’s easily $17-20 for a bowl of pho or bun bo hue. I ordered 3 bowls of bun bo hue off grab and it was only 160k (the portion sizes are smaller but even if I ate all 3 myself, that’s only about $6.50?) \n I did a lot of searching on this reddit to see where I should get my hair cut done at. I ended up going to Hair Bar in district 1 - for females, it was 580k for shampoo+mini massage, hair cut, and styling (480k if you want a quick shampoo). I’m sure there are cheaper places, but I wanted to try and get the best if possible. I recommended my sister in law to go there as well, she also enjoyed it.\n For a full body massage, facial, and hair wash, I went to Yushi Clinic Beauty & Spa in district 3 and it was about 840k for a wonderful experience - it was about 2.5 hrs long. It could have been cheaper, but I asked for some add-ons such as the facial and a scalp treatment. \n For clothes shopping, some of the shops I enjoyed were: Uniqlo SC Studios ($30-110/item ; lots of linen & silk) Rosie ($12-30 for most items, $40-50 for coats) Libe ($12-30/item) Dear Jose ($80+ dresses) Secondee Flanh\n I visited Aufra & Len Clothing as well which had some nice styles, but the quality wasn’t as nice as say, Libe or Rosie, for the same cost. \n My favorites were SC Studios and Rosie\n    submitted by    /u/XiaoMilly  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Met a nice businessman from Singapore who told me about buying property in Vietnam as an investment. He’s very bullish on the real estate in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. Sounds like a really attractive prospect since I can’t really afford a home in California. \n Was wondering how this works. I’m assuming it’s frowned upon but also isn’t Vietnam communist? So can one truly purchase land or is it land use rights? Is there a property management industry like the US? Is contract law respected here? Can a foreigner even own land?\n As a fast growing economy I see reason to both allow and limit how foreign investment enters a country (especially after seeing how foreign money came into the states pre-pandemic).\n Disclaimer: I’m just a tourist and I don’t think I’d actually buy here. I don’t have any personal ties here so I’d be too scared to put significant money here. The businessman told me about police bribery and getting screwed over by his last partner here.\n    submitted by    /u/ricardianrhythm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/18ql057\n I saw that many people think that compare a person to a dog is a casual, light-hearted joke. I am not sure about that in western, but in Vietnam, it is totally not true. In Vietnam, compared a person to a dog, no matter your intention, is a serious insult asking for violence. The similar one in the west is \"fu*k u bit*h!\" or \"you son of a bit*h!\". So yeah, just don't do it. The only exception is that you intentionally want to insult the other and want to have a fight :)\n Edit: as mentioned by some people \"cún\" (puppy) is fine for kids and girl friends to show that they are cute and you love them. \"chó\", on the other hand, is not ok.\n    submitted by    /u/vantubka  \n [link]   [comments]",

We supposed to meet a friend of my mom around district 9 then he drived us all to Phan Thiet. We couldn't find a proper parking slot but a nice household let we parked at their home. The thing is there is no ticket required. Even though i have some small bumps of uncertainties, i still gamble over the kindness and friendliness in Vietnamese. It may be my overthinking mind. It would be extremely helpful for me to know what is your opinion about this. Thanks a lot. Have a great day too.\n    submitted by    /u/Suspicious-Wasabi-29  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi!\n My parents immigrated a few years before I was born in the US. I have a bit of family back home whom I've only met once. But of course I understand it's very tough back home and my family struggles often with money. \n One of my cousins is graduating high school this year and I just learned today that her parents are in no place to afford college tuition. They've all resigned themselves to that reality. My older cousin (different parents) also couldn't go to college and she makes 7 million a month, and the cycle of economic struggle persists. I'm in a position to send money for my little cousin's tuition, unfortunately couldn't help my older cousin in the same way. It is a no brainer for me. However, I want understanding of what higher education in Vietnam entails. More so out of curiosity and wanting to show support in learning about her experience than anything else.\n What is the cost? My family is based in Saigon, what are the schools nearby like, I don't think she is interested in being too far from family. Is it difficult to get into universities? What opportunities does a college degree afford? Googling I found the average entry level salary for a college graduate is 20-25 million. Any other information that comes to mind that I didn't think of?\n My mother didn't finish 8th grade due to poverty and hardship. My brother and I now have master's degrees, it is her greatest pride. I'm now a teacher, nothing is more important to me than education and knowledge. Thank you so much for helping me become better informed!!!\n    submitted by    /u/hunkomeatfunkobeats  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have hired a vietnamese interpreter to speak to staff there, however they are saying it's not their responsibility to put the lost item on the plane and that it is the responsibility of the airlines. I have contacted Japan airlines, the airline I flew on and their customer service is telling me it is the responsibility of the security/lost & found staff, so now I'm in this circle of each party saying it's the other person's responsbility. Has anyone on here ever lost something at Noi Bai? Can you tell me the steps you took to retrieve your item?

          "description": "I have a theory, and I'm hoping someone here can confirm or debunk it for me.\n I spent the weekend celebrating Christmas in Tam Đảo (it was lovely, thank you, merry Christmas), and I saw something that I've only seen a couple of times over the many years that I have lived here, but I think there has to be a reason behind it.\n Two big, black, brand new SUVs drove by with the blue government plates, then a meticulously upkept early 90's Toyota corolla, then two more fancy SUVs with government plates, and the guy in the corolla was dressed very well, clearly had money.\n Now, my theory is super wealthy people in VN have their cars from the early 90's, and because they're really rich, they're perfectly taken care of. And the reason for showing off such a generic, low-end car is because they are conveying that they are rich enough and important enough that they were able to afford a car in the early 90's, when this was an extreme rarity. \n Is this a real thing, or is there some other reason for this? Because I have only seen it a few times, but it has been more than once, so there has to be some reason that wealthy/well-connected people would choose to drive a 90's corolla or equivalent level car, right?\n    submitted by    /u/phedinhinleninpark  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I don't see that in my city (Da Nang) and other Vietnamese cities I have traveled to. The vast majority of bikes have two mirrors on both sides. The percentage of bikes with the right-side mirror removed is so low that it is unnoticeable. This percentage may be as high as the percentage of motorbikes that lost the left-side mirror or the motorbikes that lost mirrors on both sides.\n Another Reddit comment assumes that I am Vietnamese but living overseas. And so on....\n I brought it to a Vietnamese forum VOZ and asked if the experience of Reddit Vietnamese matched what happens in the place Vozer lives, they confirmed it was real. Maybe they joke to me, I don't know. But If people are joking, please stop, I don't know what is joking and what is real. What I see with my own eyes from when I was born to now (being a 25-year-old man) is not something people in Reddit and Voz described.\n I am Vietnamese but people say that I am not Vietnamese, even when I have written in Vietnamese in a local/urban/vulgar style that only Vietnamese use.

Trước gia đình mình các cụ ở nhà rảnh rỗi hay xem. Thấy nó quảng cáo bán hàng khá hấp dẫn nên vừa rồi các cụ cũng đặt mua hàng.\n Mặt hàng này là thịt trâu gác bếp (thịt trâu sấy khô). Quảng cáo là để trong tủ đá trữ được 6 tháng. Bán khá đắt (1 triệu vnd / 1kg) nên mình hi vọng chất lượng tốt. \n Không ngờ mua về để tủ đá, mới được hơn 1 tuần thì 1 gói đã mốc trắng như vậy.\n Mình gọi điện đường dây nóng phản ánh với chủ shop thì chủ shop mồm năm miệng mười, nói lấn át cả khách, đổ lỗi cho khách bảo quản.\n Mình để cả 2 gói trong tủ đá, nếu do bảo quản thì cả 2 phải bị chứ. Chưa kể trong tủ đá còn rất nhiều đồ ăn khô không bị làm sao.\n Theo mình suy đoán thì vì bán nhiều hàng nên nó làm láo, trộng hàng cũ vào bán cho khách online. Ai không cẩn thận là ăn phải hàng ôi thiu. \n Mình post lên để mọi người đề phòng với kênh youtube và hội này. Đừng để vừa mất tiền vừa mua tức vào người.\n Long story short, if you don’t know Vietnamese, stay away from SapaTV food, restaurants, and hotel. I bought their products and receive old, rotten food.\n    submitted by    /u/Duckling89  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Xin chao,\n Next month I intend to cycle from HCMC to Hanoi, with roughly the following itinerary over 28 days:\n HCMC - Vung Tau - La Gi - Mui Ne - Thap Cham - Da Lat - Nha Trang - Tuy Hoa - Quy Nhon\n (bus to Kon Tum) - Mang Den - Da Ban - Quang Ngai - Hoi An - Da Nang - Hue\n (train to Ninh Binh) - Tam Coc loop - (train to Hanoi)\n Ideally I want to spend 2+ days in the larger places mentioned and 3 in the big cities. Now the questions:\n ​\n  \nIf I dismantle my touring bike (front wheel off) and have it bagged, is it possible to transport it on a bus if I want to \"skip\" a stage (due to bad weather, injury, etc.) - e.g. Quy Nhon -> Kon Tum\n How easy is it to ride out of HCMC towards Vung Tau?\n Away from the coast, is it necessary to book hotels/guesthouses in advance, or can you just show up on the day and realistically expect a room? (my dates don't overlap with Tet). Ideally I'd like to save weight and not have to bring a tent or wild camp.\n I only finalised this trip last week, so probably won't be able to learn/speak much Tieng Viet language, and my tonal pronunciation will probably be wrong. Is this likely to be a big barrier in the rural parts of the Central Highlands?\n Do most hotels/guesthouses/hostels accept card payment?\n For trains (e.g. Hue to Ninh Binh) do tickets (particularly for travellers with bicycles) need to be reserved a day in advance?\n Are there any parts of that itinerary that you reckon should be skipped given that it's January?\n And are there any sights you would really recommend that I've not included? (I've excluded Sapa, Ha Giang and Dien Bien Phu given that presumably it's pretty cold (<10 degrees) at this time of year, and I would guess the earliest days of February in Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay can still be foggy, so I'd leave that for a summer trip, given I only have 28 days). The karst caves at Phong Nga are, I guess, probably tricky to reach on a bicycle too.\n  \nCam on rat nhieu.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/gattomeow  \n [link]   [comments]",

Speaking very broadly, the idea is something like this: A, society exists in a certain state, with certain rules and traditions and practices. B, the limitations of these rules and traditions and practices prompt a reaction against them. C, the established system and the reaction against it combine to form a new system, informed by both, which then becomes part A of a new cycle.

          "description": "I looked for some guides on the internet about this, but most of them are from Americans or Europeans, and their dating cultures are so different from each other and from Vietnamese that I don't think I can learn anything from them. So I really need some insight from my fellow people. Here are my questions:\n  \nOutside of online dating, how did you meet your gf and ex? Are most of them previously your friends, your coworkers, someone you were already familiar with? Or just strangers you bumped into?\n When you're interested in a girl, how do you approach her? My understanding is that you'd ask her out for a coffee, a milk tea, right? How successful were you? How often did you get rejected? If rejected, do you just move on and ask the next girl you're interested in, or do you persist and try again later? Are you usually interested in a lot of girls at once, or just focus on one target?\n If she accepts your invitation for a milk tea, how often did it turn into an official relationship? I mean, is dating supposed to be a numbers game where you repeatedly ask a lot of girls out, repeatedly go out with a lot of girls, just to successfully obtain a gf once in a while (let alone a wife)? I see that most people enter a relationship very easily, so it can't be that tedious, right?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/OneMoreChance2007  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are looking for a band who can perform both Vietnamese songs and English rock/alternative/pop music. We are planning a wedding that will combine both Vietnamese and \"Western\" traditions - and, of course, our own wishes and visions. \n We expect around a hundred guests. Most guests will be from Vietnam, but many people from Germany and other nations from around the world will hopefully join. So, it will be wonderful to have people from all over the world to come together, celebrate and connect with one another. We hope a band will be able to play a set before dinner and one afterwards. So, maybe around 3-4 hours in total. Afterwards, we will have a DJ put on some music and we invite the band members to join and celebrate with us. \n If you or someone you know might be interested, please message me! ;) Looking forward to hear from you!\n All best\n Niko\n    submitted by    /u/One-Cup1218  \n [link]   [comments]",

So if you've purchased liquids in the terminal they will confiscate them.\n If you ever have the chance, please let them know that they are full of shit, because we just checked with Australian Biosecurity here and they have confirmed that policy is an airline policy even though when you are boarding the plane they claim it is an Australian policy.\n Probably just trying to force you to purchase their cash only in-flight beverages.\n F*** VietJet.\n Edit: To be absolutely clear, we are talking about an additional restriction at the boarding gate, not the normal security check where we all know liquids must be surrendered.

So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:\n  \nIs Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?\n Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. I have read multiple places that Phu Quoc is overdeveloped and does not give you that \"island life\" feeling. Is there enough to do on Con Dao\n Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)\n  \nAny suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :) Thank you for all answers!\n    submitted by    /u/newyogaguru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry for the rant. But some of the public colleges and primary-high schools in HCM City keep setting back the GODDAMN TIME in which morning classes start. The old time usually was 7:15 or 7:30am, then it back to 7am, and now it become 6:45am (Some schools like HCMC University of Industry and Trade set to as early as 6:30am)\n When asked about this decision, 2 of the most popular answers from the school speaker are: - To avoid heavy traffic --> They seriously thought \"If the traffic is usually jammed at 7am, then why don't we just start the school at 6:45am?\". To me, this is such a dangerous one-sided thinking, which disregard students whose houses are very far from school. Doesn't even mention student now even have less time for breakfast anymore if they wake up at 6 o'clock or later. Plus, people who don't want to deal with heavy traffic are already aware to get up early, you don't need to force everyone has to go more earlier, as long as they go to school before it starts.\n  \nTo prevent student from coming late to class and to encourage them to wake up early--> There is no scientific research stated that the earlier the school start, the lower the student coming to school late. School in US and Europe begin at atleast 8 am so student can have good sleep, which they've done countless researches before. Again, dangerous one-sided thinking to me. As a grad student, I have twice to tripple amount of assignments despite sleeping less comparing to my time in high school. From my experience, it encourages more people to go to class late lol. My friends said this is dumb, and they ended up always going late or only go to second class (8:30 - 10:10am).\n  \nSorry if you find this rant and broken English annoying. I'm 2nd year grad student and I'm tired of waking up in 5am so that I can take buses in 5:40 to get to school in time. The reason I wrote this post so I can relieve some stress from constant complaining against my school. Hope you forgive me.\n    submitted by    /u/Vietcong777  \n [link]   [comments]",

I read manga and watch anime too but wouldnt say I know many good ones. I draw as a side hobbies, not so much recently but yeah I do love art. Have tattoos, I can recommend some good tattoo artists that I mainly go to here.

Our sleeper bus stopped on the way and I went in to use the urinal taking the first empty one (there was probably 50 urinals mostly empty). Some guy comes in right after me and takes the urinal right next to me, then proceeds to just stare over the divider at my junk very obviously for a good 20 seconds. It was very obvious since he peaked his entire head over the divider multiple times. Eventually I gave up on peeing and left to use a stall cause I felt too uncomfortable.

I got the chance to visit Vietnam for the first time in 16 years since I was born last month. I got to experience the city and the wonderful people and I got to go to my orphanage. I got back to the US just 2 weeks ago and I just miss Vietnam so much - part of it just feels like home to me and I just miss the whole vibe and general culture of the country. I have never traveled to a place where I just felt so in place and “normal” with people who were genuinely interested in me and cared about me. It honestly was an experience nice and feeling that I really cannot put into words.

He gets on his phone and coordinates with another driver to take me in their car instead. We stop at a gas station, and I get out with my pet carrier and begin to get into the other car. My driver opens the trunk to retrieve my luggage, closes the trunk lid right away and holds up a 100k bill to show me as he hands it to the new driver. I am in agreement as it seems fine with the exchange of funds to the new driver, and I pay the first driver once my ride completes.\n As I am about to enter the new car, I realize I am missing my large totebag. I tell my original driver, hey I'm missing my other bag. So I go over to the car and he opens the trunk and reaches in and retrieves my totebag. I see the totebag is placed in the trunk in a small, recessed area that just seemed odd. I didn't think much of all this at first, but at the end of the day, this incident has kept me thinking I was trying to be robbed. My totebag contained all my essential items.\n tldr: grabcar drivers says he is sick minutes into a ride, gets me a replacement car and driver and forgets to transfer all my luggage to new car.\n    submitted by    /u/d4rkc4sm  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:\n  \nIs Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?\n Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. Is there enough to do on Con Dao\n Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)\n Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :)\n  \nThank you for all answers!\n    submitted by    /u/newyogaguru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to start from the end and say that ultimately nothing happened to us, and we continue to enjoy our trip here.\n My partner and I are visiting Vietnam and we are currently in Hanoi. Last evening we were walking around the Hoàn Kiếm area, when at some point a man seemed to have offered us something (I did not hear/understand). I have simply politely responded \"no thanks\" and my partner and I continued walking. From that point, I could see from the corner of my eye he was walking behind us. We did not interact further. At some point, he passed us and was now ahead of us by a few steps. Whenever we stopped (to look at our map, cons…",

          "description": "I've been in vietnam for over 2 weeks now and I've been really depressed about the racism I'm facing here. To give some context, I'm chinese and indian, quite dark skinned, female. \n The counts of racism I've faced here is absolutely disheartening, maybe because of my background, I tend to notice the implicates of it. Other - I've been really well behaved, trying to break the misconceptions about my countrie(s) not because I deliberately want to, but because that's how I am. I'm introverted, am always polite, tip well, do not indulge in the bad stuff. \n  \nAt the hotel I was in, I saw white tourists get upgraded and also an Asian Australian man get upgraded (their original rooms were not available). In my case I was asked to wait 3 hours for my room, when I asked if I could pay for a better room, they happily obliged. This happened on the same day, around the same time. \n \nCustomer service - Specually in hotels again, I saw how other customers were treated over me. Unfortunately, I did notice a theme going around with the skin tone. I saw a couple who came in after me order much more elaborate dishes, it was only after they finished almost eating, was I served my very simple dish. \n \nThe cherry on top, I took a tour to a popular tourist guide with a English speaking tour guide, he went on to speak about how brown skin is not considered beautiful in vietnam, that it's ugly, relates to poor and bad behavior as he himself was brown, he did not have good experiences in vietnam with his love life, job etc.. this really broke my heart. This country is supposed to have the kindest of people, having read the previous threads too, I didn't expect to have this experience in Vietnam of all places. \n \n I just wanted to share this with all the people of colour who keep asking this question if the vietnamese are racist. Here's your answer. Ofcourse, it's not as blatant, or direct, but hurtful nonetheless.\n    submitted by    /u/Pale-Quiet9320  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Alright, first of all, I'm a Vietnamese. Using English here, because well, why the hell not?\n University in this nation just feels forced. Not like \"conscription\" stuff but, keeps organizing random events and forces students to participate, and if not, deduct bunch of \"diem ren luyen\" or whatever. I just feel like students should have the rights to whether to go or not. Like recently, my university had some sort of Shoppe-sponsored event and of course, to make the sponsors happy, they force every students to attend, standing in the sun for 1 hour then listen to annoying love-related songs about bunch of \"I love you then you dump me\" non-sense. Or forcing students to clean up construction debris in the university. Wow, unpaid working. 10/10, Law university. And upcoming, another sport event that if they didn't threaten to deduct points, probably no one would attend because 90% of the students aren't bothered to wake up at 8AM in Sunday, just to watch bunch of fellow university students playing badmintons and running.\n I understand the morality behind the non-sense of that points system, for \"đánh giá về phẩm chất chính trị, đạo đức, lối sống của sinh viên trên năm mặt đánh giá\" but using this so that the teachers can prove that \"my university organizes events and the students are totally not enforced to come and this will do very well for publicity\" is not really a good excuse to use this points system. Because some university students have their own life to deal with and should not be forced to participate in events that for a lack of better words, they don't give a f- about (there're defo better words). Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Students have their own life and you having free time doesn't mean you should torture the students. \n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/PieNextDoor  \n [link]   [comments]",

But for their own currency, they only allow travellers to bring in 15million VND which is $620USD equivalent. Anymore than 15million VND in cash has to be declared. That is so weird? Anyone has any experience of bringing in more than 15million dongs in vietnam? Do you actually need to declare? If you did, what did they do? Do they just straight up confiscate the difference?\n Edit: People seem confused so I’ll explain further: \n Guys I am talking about arrivals. Not departure. I’m BRINGING IN 30million dong cash to vietnam to SPEND. I’m NOT BRINGING VND OUT of vietnam. I dont understand why would they limit the bringing of their currency that’s the most legal and accepted to be used in their country so severely.

          "description": "Been here for a while now and I am honestly SO tired of being misled by top tier hotel reviews online that turn out to be rigged or fake. Every “well-reviewed” hotel or accommodation (even higher end ones) I’ve stayed in was so terrible (or subpar at best) despite raving reviews online which leads me to believe it’s all fake and manipulated. \n Then, whenever you leave an honest review or comment on booking.com or google that isn’t a 9 or 10, hotel staff will literally track you down on your personal whatsapp or e-mail to emotionally blackmail you urging you to delete or edit your comment, or worse! They will even threaten you! \n Pictures on websites are insanely misleading too and idk why but staff always give off this insanely fake vibe with weird fabricated personas they sport because they they think this somehow pleases tourists? (Spoiler: IT DOES NOT, everything just feels pretty off and not genuine at all).\n All very exhausting. I’m leaving Vietnam soon and couldn’t be happier to leave this all behind me. \n Sorry I just had to rant for a moment after countless disappointing experiences.\n    submitted by    /u/tacodocks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not saying I'm not fine with the price I paid even if it was overpriced I'm just curious how well I did bargaining and if I got a good price as at the start of my trip I was overpaying like double at minimum for everything and haggling is a brand new concept to me as a Canadian.

After tax rebate it’s 9M, about 25% cheaper than I’d pay for it in the UK.\n iPhone 15 works out at around £800, so 20% cheaper than in the UK.\n As far as I can tell there shouldn’t be any regional differences in hardware or software, albeit Apple warranty isn’t international as far as I can tell.\n    submitted by    /u/rax94  \n [link]   [comments]",
