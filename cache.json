Is there any special time in November when events are occuring? For eg: events where we can witness fireworks?\n Also, in general, travel tips would really really help us! What places should we cover and what are absolute gems? Is safety a concern we should have? I am from India bdw. We are planning to book a return flight from a different city than the city we will be landing in since we wish to cover many places. Also, we will be in Vietnam for around 10 days. \n I also wanted to confirm if USD is accepted everywhere. We will also be carrying Forex cards. \n I really apologize for so many questions.

AFAIK, it’s very popular among younger readers. \n Fun fact: Ayn Rand was extremely vocal against the Vietnam War believing Communism would have collapsed without intervention (lol?) while the voice of America, John Steinbeck, publicly supported the war (in private, it was more complex than that). He also famously hated ideological orthodoxy i.e even calling champagne socialists “temporarily embarrassed capitalists” (sound familiar?).

Background em học chuyên khá lớn, IELTS 7.5, em xét tuyển sớm và đỗ nên cũng không quan trọng điểm thi THPT nhưng thi không ôn gì cũng đc 27 điểm. Flex tí nhưng, ai cũng sẽ tưởng một đứa thế này thì lo quái gì. Em thành thật em khá lo về cái long run cho sự nghiệp. Em đang học tài chính vì nó hay và rộng nhưng em thật sự chưa biết cái gì phù hợp. Cái chính là ở đại học em chưa biết nên chú trọng cái gì ạ, em có thử tham gia các CLB nhưng failed. Em cũng muốn đi thi case nhưng chưa đủ kiến thức. Em còn định thưc tập nhưng chưa có công ty tuyển. Địng hướng của em đang định vào big3 consulting hay big4, em cũng khá muốn làm về data hay business analyst. Nhưng em lại thấy khá nản và yêu cầu rất cao kiểu em not good enough. Hiện tại em thực sự mê consulting và em cần một số lời khuyên để nổi bật ạ. Em thấy bản thân đang khá phai mờ, tại vì có quá nhiều cơ hội trên đại học và em không biết nên đầu tư vào đâu. Em thấy mình khá vô dụng, đại học nhiều người giỏi lắm nhưng em không biết học đến đó bằng cách nào huhu. Em không muốn 4 năm tuổi thơ mình chỉ có học, xong chơi, làm mấy công việc kiếm tiền qua ngày rồi bị đá ra ngoài xã hội loay hoay nhìn bạn bè phát triển.\n    submitted by    /u/Adventurous_Body2019  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello All,\n I have posted here a year or so ago about the difficulties of getting my daughter her birth certificate here. My wife is Vietnamese, I am American, and we live in Vietnam which is where my daughter was born. The birth certificate issue was due to us giving her a western name and no one here telling us you cannot do that and instead just rejecting the birth certificate. So we got that resolved and gave our daughter a Vietnamese name and now have her birth certificate so the next step is getting a passport so I can take them to meet my family in America.\n It has been atleast 6 months and no passport.

Just curious if this mentality is common.\n A Vietnamese friend of mine told me that its often true simply because car drivers are perceived to be more financially capable to bear the costs, even if they're not at fault. If this is true, that's pretty messed up. \n Update: Motorcyclist is still trying to text and call me for cash. I suggested we settle this in the police station with my rear cam recording at hand. But he rejected. I'm starting to believe that this dude probably doesn't even have a license.\n    submitted by    /u/mojotarts  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a second-gen Viet American, which of course comes with its own set of deep cognitive dissonance. \n I'm quite proud of my culture and celebrate it openly, and I'm also very lucky to have grown up in an area with strong Viet communities. As I went into high school, as a reaction to dismal education on the history of the Vietnam war, I did a lot of reading on my own and was pretty surprised by how different it was to my parent's accounts. \n Of course I understood my parents went through unimaginable hardships during the war, I absolutely don't dismiss their personal experiences. I think it's common for Viet-American kids to be raised being told that HoChiMinh is an evil, genocidal man and that the communist party is the worst thing ever.

          "description": "I’ll be traveling to Vietnam in two weeks. I’ll be in Saigon, Da Nang/Hoi An, and Hanoi (and the surrounding area perhaps). I am not on a backpacker budget but I figure for most of the trip there is still no reason to spend anymore than like 1,000,000 VND (30-40 USD) a night because the rooms are nice enough at that price. \n But, this trip is somewhat of a celebration (just finished law school and took the bar) so at least once in the trip I would like to splurge, by Vietnamese standards, and get a really nice room. I guess like 3,500,000 VD (150 USD) a night. \n I was thinking this would be best done in Da Nang because it’s on the beach and it’ll will be a pretty relaxing part of my trip. It didn’t seem necessary to spend too much in Saigon because I’ll be out and about all day and basically just sleeping at the hotel. \n So, does this line of thinkingmake sense, and if so, can anyone recommend some more upscale places that you’ve had good experiences at? Would like a nice pool and bar area, good food, service, etc… \n Open to this stuff in Saigon and Hanoi as well just like I said, doesn’t seem as worth it as Da Nang but open to being proved wrong.

Mỗi năm có hàng triệu người chết vì tai nạn giao thông, mà đa phần là do những nguyên nhân hoàn toàn có thể phòng tránh được. Mấy người vi phạm thì tức là đang tăng rủi ro tai nạn lên cho bản thân và người khác, đến lúc tai nạn tàn phế ra thì ai cứu, chỉ còn biết than trời chứ làm thế nào được?\n Thứ hai: Csgt ăn đút lót thì chính mấy người vi phạm là người đút lót, csgt lỗi 10 thì mấy người cũng lỗi 7-8. Giả sử bạn vi phạm, bị vẫy lại, thay vì xin ghi biên bản, nộp bằng lái nộp phạt, thì lại chọn đút lót cho csgt hứa em không sai nữa, và rồi về chửi là csgt ăn hối lộ? Mà nếu các ông nghĩ mình không sai bị ăn tiền láo thì làm mẹ biên bản đi cho nó chuẩn chứ rén à mà hối lộ? Khó hiểu? Xong giả sử gặp ông csgt chuẩn, nhất quyết không nhận hối lộ thì lại lên mạng cào phím nhà nước phạt lắm tiền hút máu dân à?\n Tất nhiên tôi không cổ vũ cho hành động ăn hối lộ của csgt, hai cái sai thì không làm nên một cái đúng. Chỉ là nếu mọi người có ghét csgt thì hãy tìm lý do khác như kiểu gặp mấy thằng cảnh sát hách dịch, thái độ hà hiếp dân chẳng hạn, chứ tự người vi phạm đút lót để cho qua chuyện mà giờ lại chửi csgt ăn tiền thì nó vô lý.\n P/s: bình thường thì \"thằng cảnh sát\", \"chó vàng\", \"pikachu\" nhưng lúc ăn nhậu hay vặn quá tay ga bị vẫy thì chìa mấy trăm ra gọi \"anh cảnh sát\" ngọt xớt :)\n    submitted by    /u/redditorspawnrandom  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got enough of a perspective.\n I don't follow the sub closely, but lately I can't help but notice the posts where the OP is really dumbfounded that a totally different Asian culture with a heavy history has it's ways in day-to-day life and views?\n To me it looks like the certain disdain and irritation as in \"Why you guys aren't like Bali, where the culture is all so westernized and easy for us to consume?\"\n It seems so natural for me that when facing a different culture and especially in a developing country I am very respectful and accepting of the way they are. Instead of being on a high moral ground and in a position of a consumer, I try to get to know the people, the culture and be thankful that I'm being welcomed to their home.\n UPD. Since people get confused about what I'm trying to say. There are things that are deeply rooted in the culture of a nation. That's the \"otherness\" that people may or may not appreciate, but that's unique to every culture.\n There are problems that arise from socio-economical background and are pretty common in Asia and all around the developing countries. Those are things no Vietnamese is proud of but we are on the track of dealing with them.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/farting_tomato  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know it's a personal choice to eat how you want. And some foreigners also eat with the putrid sound of wet mushy food smacking back and forth while eating with their mouth open.\n But I find it to be much more common here in Vietnam. \n To me, it's one of those sounds that rattle my insides. Similar to someone rubbing a balloon or scraping on a chalk board. \n I'm sitting at a coffee shop now and a couple just sat next to me and they are both mouth smacking their food for the past 10 minutes or so. Even putting my earbuds in and putting the volume high. I can still hear it\n I know others also find this sound irritating. And it's obvious that people are able to eat without opening their mouths all the way 500 times during a meal and showing everyone the visuals and sounds of the first steps of the human digestion process\n I don't say anything. I'm not being a Karen. But it's absolutely disgusting. Why don't friends say anything to these people? Or literally nobody cares and it's enjoyable to eat a meal with these people as they make some of the most unappetizing noises? Why so common here in Vietnam? Like, the louder you eat your food, the richer you are? It brings you good luck or something? \n Nasty noises from your mouth keep the ghosts away maybe? 👻\n    submitted by    /u/EastWestNS  \n [link]   [comments]",

For reference, I am European Australian while my partner was born and raised in Vietnam. Any children we have will most likely grow up in Australia, though will frequently visit Vietnam to see family. We want to choose a first name that can easily be used in both Australia and Vietnam.\n We have been looking into Western first names that when shortened also sound like a Vietnamese name (this would be their nickname and also what they are called when in Vietnam). For example:\n (F) Maia (shortened to Mai) / (F) Maysie (shortened to May) / (M) Vincent (shortened to Vinh).\n Do you guys think this is too weird? 😅 Can you think of any other names like this?\n Otherwise, we were thinking of using a Vietnamese first name that is easy for English speakers to pronounce. Does anyone have any ideas?\n Opinions and advice would be great, thank you 😊\n Edit: We are mostly struggling with male names, though recommendations for female names would also be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/This-Cheesecake-6864  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m curious about how family members show love in their daily life. \n I (30F) don’t remember the last time I gave my parents hugs or said “I love you” to them. I love them dearly, but it feels really awkward for me to say loving words or be affectionate toward them. \n In our nuclear family, we give each other big hugs and say “I love you” every single day. My kids would get very upset if I forgot to do those things before rushing to work. \n My parents at their 70s don’t sleep together anymore, and I never heard them say “I love you” to each other. I feel bad for them. I really wanna give my parents some support but there’s always an invisible wall between me and them that I find it so difficult to break. \n I wonder if my situation is typical in Vietnamese culture or is it just my family background? My parents rarely say sweet words, always try to suppress their feelings and emotions (except for anger and frustrations 😑).

          "description": "Having lived in Vietnam and other parts of asia for quite a while, there is one topic which is quite difficult to understand ; real estate and its pricing.\n My general observations to date :\n - Generally, land is highly sought after for both investment, speculation and living. They're seen as an appreciating asset. Prices are eyewateringly high in major urban centers by global standards. Value is not in the home on the land (often knocked down quickly), but rather in the land itself\n - Condominiums are depreciating assets ; as they age, new projects pop up, generally the price tends to go down over time. That said, there are those who hope to buy a project off-plan (eg. before it is built), and then resell it by the time it is competed hoping to make money (arguably also speculation)\n - Foreigners face restrictions (cannot own land without complicated workarounds), and for condominiums must buy from a specific pre-allocated set of units in certain projects, which stays below a threshold (I believe 49%). Then there's the leasehold structure of 50 years which may impact the sale-ability\n Would love to get input on whether this is right, what I've missed and what more there is to this.I still have lots of questions, such as :\n - Are vietnamese subject to the leasehold structure?\n -How firm ones individual rights are in the case the Govt plans some project that impacts ones residence?\n - To what extent is there predictability to the prices or if its just a FOMO (fear of missing out) speculation frenzy?- If condominiums generally depreciate, then is it really a worthwhile financial investment?\n -How are land prices set? is it wild west or is there a government appraisal / pricing process? if so, how come land prices even in fairly rural places are higher per square meter than for example, London?\n    submitted by    /u/throwback5971  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I hate that shit when I was a kid. Literally the most toxic thing to discuss about. Made me and many other people feel like shit and awkward. I don’t know why this became the norm. It’s like they think that because we’re kid, we don’t have feelings and don’t feel sad when adult talk down on us and compared us to other people. I know that in Vietnamese culture, respecting adults is utmost important even when what they are doing is wrong, which is probably why it has been happening for so long. Just imagine asking them back “well why aren’t you as successful and better shape than Chu Ut? You had more time than me at being successful, why are you comparing me to other kids?” Definitely will get the stick for that haha.\n    submitted by    /u/tankhuu3018  \n [link]   [comments]",

DL is really not known for teaching you words in a logical order and often giving you weird starter examples but VN version is next-level to me. Sometimes it teaches certain really random words. Like starting with things like ong (bee) for Vietnamese. Mhh OK... Anyway, Indonesian is similar but it's still great for daily vocabulary practice :)\n But I wonder... Is this what I will have to learn to read for real? I seriously feel like Duolingo curriculum creators are fucking with you in the first few lessons. Like why would you pick the name of the main antagonist to be An, and then you have your first sentences to be stuff like An ăn anh ấy. I'm making this example up because I forgot the exact ones, but the early samples have something like this where it's just non-stop an's and as a beginner you're just like.... Mother of God LOL cmon bro.\n I feel like they legit put the most unfavorable sentences at the start to make you question if you want to learn the language O_o. I know that due to tones you can easily have many words that look the same but... It seems so unrealistic to me to have simple sentences in literally the beginner section and then teach something like \"Con cá cắn cái ca\"... I feel like they do this on purpose LMAO...

Strangely enough my children found the tip money slipped under their room door.\n Did the bellhop return it out of distaste that it was too little or any other reason? From what I can recall tipping is not mandatory and I thought that amount was better than nothing. Thoughts?\n *Edit: Thank you everyone for your input. I could understand it could be bc the tip came from my children and accepting it was against some moral code or out of pity. It also could be possible that he thought the tip was way too low; Ill never know unless I hear it from him.\n *It is very interesting to hear everyones opinion about tipping as well.

Although it’s nothing new at all that these internet celebs jump on any topic that promises to be generating clicks and views, it’s somehow still mind boggling to me that a Viet Kieu (from Germany) coming to Vietnam, rises to fame here, and then learning absolutely nothing about Vietnam’s history and touches a topic that’s highly sensitive here. While on holidays. Via Instagram. \n So my question is: What do you think about Viet Kieus coming to Vietnam and claiming to be genuine Vietnamese (obviously for career moves) and is the general public aware of that behavior?\n    submitted by    /u/medium_nice_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m a Korean American expat based in South Korea the past 16 yrs. For the first time, my Korean native gf, her brother, and I visited Ho Chi Minh for a week July 22-28. I know the saying is visiting and living are two different things.. \n Nonetheless, we had a blast. Stayed in an Airbnb at Vinhomes Central Park and went to a good mix of touristy foodie spots many near Ben Thanh Market and to local spots around the city where we couldn’t use any English to order. \n We were quite surprised by the weather temperatures as we were expecting hot weather similar to Thailand but it was rather cool the entire time. It’s actually hotter and more humid in Korea right now.\n Never visited Bui Vien Walking street as my gf and I aren’t heavy party-goers or drinkers (I’m in my early 40’s and she’s in her late 30’s and we’ve had our fair share of debauchery in our 20’s and early 30’s). Her brother was keen on checking it out but we just never made it.\n The only thing I wish I was able to check out is the bjj/mma/combat sports scene as I’ve been training myself the last 9 yrs in Korea. Saw a few bjj gyms I wanted to check out but also didn’t want to be selfish and take away from the time I should be spending with my gf and her brother. Am curious as to what the scene is like in Vietnam if anyone that trains would care to share.\n Here are some photos of our trip as well. A bunch of the cliché touristy spots. I’m also a photographer so I prefer shooting with my dslr rather than a phone and edited the photos in my editing style which might not be the best or most realistic representation of the places. But these the ones I’ve shared to my sns. \n We absolutely loved Ho Chi Minh and are keen to visit Hanoi the next time we make it back.\n Been lurking in this sub the last week to gain insight into this fascinating country and would love to hear any and all experiences, both good and bad, from those actually living here if anyone cares to share.\n    submitted by    /u/pauljean613  \n [link]   [comments]",

My mom definitely intends on visiting for 3 weeks, and she asked me if I can request work off to go with her (for 2-3 weeks). I currently work at a ski resort, and February is our busiest time of the year. To be honest, I don’t really want to go. I feel uncomfortable staying with my family for various reasons; I would also be going from below freezing now in high elevation to a humid tropical climate, but most of all I always feel anxious around my Mom. I had also been talking about and planning a trip with my partner to go to Italy for a week in March, so I’m not even sure if I’d be allowed to take that much time off in such a short amount of time.

That said, I've lived in three other Asian countries prior to coming to Vietnam, but the attitude and behavior of the foreigners in online communities here are the worst I've seen, particularly on reddit and especially above all on Facebook, at least in the Ho Chi Minh City online communities.\n  \nIf you dare to mention one single thing you dislike about Vietnam (not even mentioning the many other things you DO like - and even if you do, you might get the following treatment) you get shouted at by other foreigners immediately telling you to just go home and calling you an entitled, colonizing, crybaby Westerner. Often these will be the most liked replies, particularly on Facebook.\n \nI've seen foreigners in online communities seriously defend things like littering, disobeying of traffic laws (Vietnam has a rather high rate of traffic fatalities), loud street karaoke at midnight, cutting in line, and other such things as just \"cultural relativism\" (as though littering isn't objectively bad for the environment - people ok reddit were honestly defending littering), often with a healthy dose of whataboutism and telling the person to go home. Again, these will often be the most liked replies.\n \nI've seen people posting on online communities asking about problems(ex: \"is it a problem when I've seen multiple cockroaches in my apartment in one week\") or simple questions like \"is the rain in October THAT bad?\" only to get bluntly called an idiot and mistreated. \n \n As said, I've lived in three other Asian countries and participated in their online communities, and the foreigners in Vietnam are seriously the worst I've seen on their discourse. Even the weebs in Japanese communities, who are quite the sight at times, are less toxic and that is really saying something.\n So, why is this such a problem?

I know that there are many restricted medications available without a script in some pharmacies but I really can’t afford to be without them and would love to know if there is a safe and more legit way to do this. \n I’m a little unsure about being able to access them and am worried it will impact my ability to stay for longer than 30-60 days at a time. I have prescriptions from home and while the law stipulates that I am only allowed to bring 7 days worth of this medication into the country/m- though I haven’t had issues with this previously.

During my stay, I went on a trek led by a Hmong woman, and she shared some tips about how to support the local minority groups when traveling in this region. Here are the highlights:\n  \nDo your research when booking trekking expeditions. Most Sapa trekking companies are run by Vietnamese agencies that pay the local guides just a couple of dollars a day. We trekked with Sapa Sisters, which is owned and operated by Hmong women. The guides that lead Sapa Sisters treks receive half the profits from their treks as well as health insurance and paid maternal leave. Our guide said her dream is for everyone to get to work for Sapa Sisters, but for that to happen, they need more business. \n \nAlmost all hotels and hostels in Sapa town are owned by Vietnamese companies. To support the locals, consider staying at a homestay in one of the nearby villages. These are often run by families from one of the nearby minority groups. It is super easy to catch a taxi or motorbike to get to these homestays, and they really appreciate the business. Plus, the views and food are better further out from the city!\n \nTry to buy souvenirs directly from locals.

Whilst travelling in Vietnam I found myself wondering: is drug use and abuse common in Vietnam? For example do college kids experiment with marijuana or try ecstasy at clubs?

Facing world #1 and the back-to-back World Cup champions. The USA.\n Let's be honest, Vietnam was expected to get their butts kicked by the US. The 13-0 thrashing of Thailand in the 2019 World Cup wasn't out of the question.\n What ended as a 3-0 win by the US where Vietnam played very strong defensively, disrupted the US from many opportunities, and the goalkeeper also saved a penalty kick which was an awesome moment to watch.\n The joy on the face of the goalkeeper in this photo, and also the respect in the style of handshake she is offering the opponent after the loss. Something about this photo is just awesome. \n The faces of both Vietnamese players. Knowing they went up against the world #1. And although they didn't do the completely unexpected and pull out a victory. They did do the unexpected as they managed to keep the score very manageable and respectable. That locker room after the match probably felt like a victory party. There was not much to be disappointed about after that match.\n I hope to see them do well in their upcoming matches.

During covid there was a massive overreaction and national unity to be safe. The highest death rate in Vietnam is due to roadside accidents. Way more deaths than by Covid. So why do people continue to drive so badly? I see people FaceTiming, eating Banh Mi, driving into people, running red lights, the list goes on. I have also unfortunately seen many people dead on the road due crashes. \n Will this ever change?

          "description": "This r/place event shows how poor Vietnam's internet culture is when many Vietnamese first use a global, mixed-country social network. Most Vietnamese people only use Facebook or TikTok to chat with fellow countrymen in their community. So, like fish in a pond going to sea, some embarrassing aspects can be seen:\n Weird nationalism is most evident when a propaganda poster is the first choice of art to show Reddit about our country. There's nothing wrong with wanting to show sovereignty, but this event isn't the place to do it. So among various creative artworks, the propaganda poster appears very out of place. We could've drawn cultures, buildings, or famous people instead. If you use Facebook a lot, you can also see for yourself how obsessed Vietnamese are with nationalism.\n Facebook doesn't have a clear upvote and downvote system like Reddit, so many Vietnamese people who only use Facebook have the habit of commenting mindlessly in their own way and get downvoted straight away as a result when they comment on Reddit. That illustrates how poor their reasoning and chatting skills are.\n Vietnamese Facebookers and tiktokers tend to follow the crowd and blame others. When the Vietnamese artwork expanded, there were thousands of copy-paste comments with empty apologies and blaming an unknown third party. But without doing anything to fix it, the affected communities have to do it themselves. They only care to save their faces to feel good while doing nothing.\n As a Vietnamese person myself, I used to use Facebook a lot in the past, but nowadays I barely use it because of the terrible internet culture in Vietnam. After finding out about Reddit, I find it a much better social media platform for entertainment and discussion. Engaging in Vietnamese Facebook posts is just really frustrating to me.\n    submitted by    /u/penguinhunter204  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have come up with several activities to accommodate the kids as many of them have either physical or mental disabilities.\n One of the ideas that I proposed which got the go ahead was to play some songs on the recorder for the kids. I heard that music can be very engaging towards those that have mental disabilities. Some advice that I received was to pick songs that would be familiar to the kids so that they could enjoy it.\n So is there any song recommendations that the kids would know? Vietnamese nursery rhymes? Anything along that vein? Although I do have a musical background I have not touched the recorder in quite a while. So songs that might be too complicated would be a no go HAHA.\n Anyways thanks for reading, have a great day!\n    submitted by    /u/DrTRedstone  \n [link]   [comments]",

Content channels that focus on science are carefully curated, making it challenging for them to become popular. Instead, groups that boast about achievements, offer humor, or criticize celebrities tend to gain significant traction. This has always piqued my curiosity, as finding groups that genuinely provide valuable knowledge is a rarity. If you happen to know any such groups, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could share their names and information!\n Regarding the group I'm currently enjoying, it can be found at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/vietnambinhan. \n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/rnwk36fsjvdb1.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=b158cd018757cbd9d6a408ae7bf810b6891cc49f\n    submitted by    /u/VinesHa0210  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I think this is the problem that some of us are facing when having typical Asian parents. The relationship between me (26) and my mom (65 years old) is really bad that we didn’t have a proper conversation for 10 years (+). It's not that she did anything wrong, it's just the age gap between us that makes us hard to understand each other. And the things she thoughts were good for me made me felt uncomfortable and pushed me further away from her. I wouldn’t go in details but I think we all understand what they are.\n I left the country when I was 16 years old and leave far away from her since then. But because of that reason, our relationship is getting better. I only came to visit once before Covid. And that visit turned out terrible. As soon as we spoke to each other, we fight. I then came to the conclusion that as long as I kept a safe distance from her, our relationship will be improved.\n I can tell that she is trying to fix our relationship in recent years. Every time she called me, she really tried to not say anything wrong or to upset me. The things she did wrong that hurt me, she no longer does. It's just the negative feelings toward her that already haunted me.\n I wanted to try, but the idea of speaking to her itself made me feel uncomfortable, not to mention the long quiet between us. \n In the last couple of years, I don't really find myself trying to improve the relationship anymore. I am happy without speaking to her, although I still endear her a lot. To make up for my neglect, I take care of her by sending money back to Vietnam. I understand that it's not enough. And as her child, I need to do more for her.\n But she is getting older, I know that any conversation I have with her could be the last one. I am too scared of the idea that I will regret not taking action sooner one day. However, I don’t know how to fix this and where to start with. My Vietnamese fellow, if you were in the same situation, could you give me some suggestions?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/aliceito  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "First and for most thank you for reading this,\n For context, I moved to California when I was in 4th grade. I've studied in America for almost 10 years. I've struggled and pulled through a lot, and I've been accepted to a very well-known university (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) in California for engineering (highly recruited and famous among all tech companies). \n My options were: UCSB, UCD, Cal Poly, and UCI. I chose Cal Poly. \n I can stay in America and make a lot of money, but my parents are getting old and I planned to live near them. I can write and speak in both Vietnamese and English, but I prefer English as my main language (writing in Vietnamese can be a struggle). \n Since, I have lived in America for so long, I'm not familiar with the job prospect in Vietnam. I hope to work for a foreign company in Vietnam that pay me well for my prestigious foreign degree and skills.\n Therefore, I need advice on what kind of engineering or degree would yield me the most job prospect in Vietnam. \n Options: Computer Engineering, Data Science & Statistics, Mechanical Engineering, or Business \n Any insights or combinations of degrees that would optimize my salary would be greatly appreciated. Any kind of experience or companies that I can focus to break into? \n I plan on getting an MS degree also.\n Please give me a reasonable salary range that I can expect to work in Vietnam for a foreign company.\n My parents live in HCM City. \n If you spend time reading all of this to understand my situation, I hope you know that I greatly appreciate your time. I consider Vietnam my hometown, and a place that I love. Thank you so much!\n    submitted by    /u/Pretty-Hawk-7528  \n [link]   [comments]",

Growing up, I remember tons of \"us vs. them\" stories and how the sound of northern accent can instantly put them (moms family) into an angry and aggressive mode. I never really gave it much thought because I'm American. I've only visited Vietnam twice years ago.\n Anyways I've lived in Japan for a few years and met a girl from Hanoi. I've never dated a Vietnamese girl before and honestly never thought I would. Conversation wise and personality wise, I think we get along quite well. It's funny because we have to communicate in Japanese, which is neither of our mother tongues. I'm now more motivated to improve my Vietnamese, and her English is making good progress too.\n We aren't dating officially, but both of us are definitely interested in next steps. We are both 30+ so I think we both recognize the need for discretion and caution, to respect each other's time, feelings, and limitations. I need to be in America for the time being so it would be long distance. \n My main concern is regarding potential culture clashes with her being from the north. I hate to say it but my family is so judgmental and can be blindly toxic. Im really worried how my mom would react. I know it's illogical and kinda racist behavior so before people attack my mother, please understand that she comes from war torn Vietnam and we have lost numerous family members during the war. They have serious trauma associated with the northern accent, and I would like to hear what others think and how their experiences have fared.\n Any thoughts, advice or discussion is welcome.

I'm married and my wife and I have a daughter. \n We've travelled a lot and stayed at a lot of different hotels and resorts. One thing my wife and I have always noticed, the coffee at these resorts is terrible. \n How can a resort that charges 1.7 mill a night make worse coffee than Ca Phe 123 I can find down some random street who only charges 25k? \n My wife says it's becuase the resort wants to make it for western customers, but a place like Vin Pearl has 90℅ Vietnamese guests. \n Like, go to any cafe with plastic tables and chairs and I would bet money their coffee will be better than a 5 star resort.

I noticed that there seem to be a lot of salty redditors on this sub who seem to think that all white expats in Vietnam are sex tourists, and dating the locals is an expression of \"attempting to quench their thirst for submissive Asian girls\". Pretty much every post here where an expat gets scammed by a bar girl has at least one or two redditors celebrating their misfortune.\n I don't see this attitude nearly so much in Taiwan. Nobody seems to have much of a problem with expats dating and marrying locals, and I seldom here any accusations of less than honorable motivations for doing so. \n Is it that Vietnam attracts a particularly unsavory variety of expat? Are Vietnamese men more xenophobic than their Taiwanese counterparts? Is this particular subreddit just a little bit more toxic than it's Taiwanese counterpart? \n Partially curious just for shits and giggles, but also trying to get a feel for what living in Vietnam would be like and the attitudes of locals towards expats in case the misses and I ever decide to relocate there.\n    submitted by    /u/daniel_orourke_mma  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! So recently I went to HCMC. The food and the places were amazing, but the one thing I can’t get out of my mind are the dogs around the city. At first I just saw one dog of a particular breed which is supposed to be “regular-sized” and thought that must’ve been a mixed dog. However, the more I explored the city, the more dogs I saw that had short and stubby legs (they are all different breeds btw). I even went on a Mekong delta tour and even the dogs on the island we went to were stubby as well. Can someone explain this to me or is it all just a coincidence? I’m genuinely curious about this as I’ve thought about it for a good amount of time on the flight home lol.\n  \nI read somewhere that they’re tiny mainly to fit them in smaller apartments/housing around the city. But why not get dogs of a small breed to begin with? \n \nA local humored us by saying that dogs are smaller so that they can be eaten easily (pls don’t be true T_T)\n \n    submitted by    /u/Sevi_Pie  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, probably not the best place to ask (already booked a doctors appointment to talk to a GP). \n 2-3 weeks ago I was travelling in Vietnam and went to the Cu Chi tunnels. There was a couple bats in there. While going through one the tunnels a bat flew at me, bounced off my torso and flew away. The contact was very brief and I didn’t feel like it scratched/bit me but after seeing some fearmongering tiktoks (haha cringe I know) they were saying you should get a rabies vaccine/immunoglobulin even if it didn’t bite you as the bites can go unnoticed due to their small size. It’s been 17 days since the bat flew into me. \n Should I be worried? Is lyssavirus common for bats in the area or have their been many cases? Tried to find some vietnam specific info but no luck. I know in Australia (where I am from and where I am now) that contact with bats is typically treated for rabies. \n Will definitely take the advice of the GP once we’ve talked but just wanted to know if any of you guys have had similar experiences or any knowledge.\n    submitted by    /u/Caoimhan  \n [link]   [comments]",

We passed by an owner beating a chained up dog and hearing its cries made my heart sink. On other occasions we’ve seen strays and malnourished dogs locked in cages forced to sit in the sweltering heat. This is not to say ALL Viet people treat dogs poorly, but I do sense that maybe dogs are not widely regarded in the same way as back in the States where I am from. \n As a dog lover, I find the dog meat industry horrible given what I’ve read (dogs are stolen from communities and beaten/tortured/etc or unethical farming practices) but I know to some people it is just viewed as any other type of meat (beef/pork). My hope that this practice dies out, but I know where there’s demand, there will always be people who are willing to supply. This has made me wonder if the dog meat industry is still popular and how local communities view eating dog meat?

          "description": "It's a pretty hot topic recently. Some parents want their kids to study IELTS really early, like 6-10 years old. \n Pros: Kids get to learn english very early which will most likely set them for success later on.\n Cons: It puts unnessessary stress on kids, kids can't form an opinion about politics yet so the writing task is basically a goner. IELTS is not realistic; real life english is a lot less formal than IELTS.\n I figure if you use Reddit you're probably better at English than 99% of native Vietnamese, so the opinions have a bit more merit to it.\n    submitted by    /u/LavaDirt  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, my wife and I have decided we are going to try to permanently settle in VN next year.\n I am an Australian citizen and my wife is dual Australian/Vietnamese. Since we have been saving for a house deposit in Australia, we literally have enough $$ for my wife to buy a plot of land and build a house on it in Vietnam, in the area my wife's family lives. We want to do that, have a child, and my wife can potentially start a beauty salon in the local town.\n The main requirement for this to actually happen is that I need to be able to work 100% remotely. I am a software developer, and currently working remotely in VN (at the parents' farm) due to a very flexible company policy that allows me to work up to 4 weeks per year anywhere in the world. This policy is great, but obviously unsuitable for what my wife and I want to do. So the first thing I'm going to try to do is negotiate a deal with my employer - take a pay cut, work remotely, possibly fly to AU periodically (1 week every 2 months) to do on-prem work to maintain a bit of a physical presence.\n Failing that, I would need to find a remote job. We can probably afford for me to take a 30% cut and still live very comfortably. The trick is finding an employer happy for me to be 100% in VN (I'm prepared to be very flexible to meet timezone requirements), and possibly dealing with the tax implications of being a foreigner with a foreign job permanently living here (practically - I will be on rolling 5 year visa exemptions unless I get permanent residency).\n I guess my question is - are there people here (particularly software devs) who have done anything similar, and who have any advice about dealing with tax requirements, finding remote employment, etc?\n Any input appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/inexistentia  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, it’d be easy if the card is in my dad’s name. It belongs to my aunt, who moved to the US 8 years ago. It’s her retirement. (In her not so bright moment,) she authorized it to my uncle, dad’s brother, because he lives in HCMC where she got paid from. Đông Á made them signed a separate form of the bank and kept it. Aunt and uncle don’t have a copy. They trusted Đông Á bank when the bank said they only need the government authorization form. Now they wouldn’t let my uncle get a new card. Mind you, the card has to be renew every 4 years and uncle successfully got a new card for dad once. Now the bank did a 180 saying we need to find the person who filed the bank’s form or have the copy in our hands. It’s so ridiculous and we’re at lost. We don’t have immediate relatives working at Đông Á so aunt will have to pay at least $1500 to fly back and sign the form.

          "description": "Hello, I'm coming to Vietnam for a month traveling north to south, still in the planning phase but we plan on doing a lot of day hikes and explore outside the main tourist areas, and do some activities like kayaking.\n Usually packing for holidays are quite easy for me to decide but I've never been to East Asia, and the hot weather and possible lots of rain? Makes it hard for me to decide, plus I like to travel light. \n Warmth wise is there a chance of it getting cold anywhere in August? I'm wondering if to bring a fleece or micro fleece and a synthetic padded jacket, or if a fleece and windproof jacket might do. Also probably pack a bunch of hiking shorts and 1 pair of hiking trousers.\n Coat, I have a high end thick shell raincoat, under arm zip vents, dosent pack so small into a day bag though, great in the wind, but can imagine sweating loads if it's warm and I'm walking. I have been meaning to get a lighter rain jacket so not sure if it's worth getting one instead or if a poncho will be my best friend?\n Shoes, I've got some rugged Sandles, they seem good for the citys and and anywhere near water. Daily shoes though not sure. Hiking can it get really muddy? Hiking boots seem good but annoying to carry around when not in use. Waterproof shoes I imagine feet will get super hot. Or my usual all rounder shoe is my hiking trainer. It's meshed so keeps my feet cool but takes forever to dry usually, and won't handle heavy mud/rain well, can combine with waterproof socks. Although if it's 30+ degrees maybe they might dry quicker? Or if there's any type of fast dry hiking trainer people recommend? Any tips for an would be much appreciated. Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/boxa95  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our flight was scheduled for 8:35am and upon arrival at 6:15, they apparently cancelled the flight and that it was at 6:25am. Which means that we were too late to check in. Our travel agent checked on her end and says it still showed the original details. \n Consequences: we miss the first flight, schedule a last minute flight with a different carrier, eventually missing the second leg of the flight because of the delays. Total cost is 260+160+90USD to get to where I need to be. \n Their reasoning: they provided ample notification so they were not liable for us checking in “late”. No refund. For the second leg, our flight was within 3 hrs of the next leg “according go policy”. They pulled up the relevant article on their website.

Locals rush to and fro, helping set up the fire hoses, rushing in to battle the flames in any way they can, mostly getting in the way.\n The second video is of the aftermath.

I'd prefer to bike/walk to most places and to stay close-ish to the beach. But, if there's a \"better\" place to stay further from the beach, I'm open to it. Priorities are proximity to (mostly) non-western restaurants, bars, coffee shops, historical sites—you get it.\n My biggest priority though is meeting people. I'd really like to meet some locals and travelers at bars, non-western restaurants, meet-ups—wherever. I have a bad habit of exploring cities by myself and am actively trying to change that. Looking to meet people and have a good time, but not necessarily party/go to clubs. I heard Oi Bar was a good place to start. Any and all recommendations are appreciated.

But this question originally came to me when I thought to myself\n \"Will I be seen with any disdain or ill treated if I am found out to be french when I eventually decide to go to VN?\"\n (I look very much European, but would be capable of hiding the fact that I am french as long as my passport in not required) I meant this with every ounce of respect.

Now, personally, I partially agree with what he's saying in his videos and I feel great that someone living in a society like Vietnam is brave enough to put out their different views, actively pointing out social, cultural flaws of the system (sometimes exaggerated though). I may be pretentious here but I consider myself a better than average young vietnamese person in terms of education, understanding of freedom of speech and open-mindedness, it would have been nice to have some meaningful polite conversations about his videos but as of right now, Vietnam is not at that level yet.\n    submitted by    /u/Theboyscampus  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thief took great advantage of us being vulnerable as it was raining, we were trying to manage our two kids and looking for a place to eat. Find my iPhone located it near a pawn shop 3 kms away from where we were. We were so tired and frustrated from our trip + the hotel staff advised us that there is no point pursuing the phone or the police. Later, a shop owner told us to w should have gone to the police and they might have been able to help. Whatever. Now we are back in our country. It is what it is but as much as I don’t want it does affect our emotions and feelings towards Hanoi and touristy areas. This can happen in many places and in many countries but still when it happens to one personally, it’s hard to not be biased.

Which sim card to take for this 30 day plan ? 3. I see lot of buses operate in cities. Are these AC buses, operate on time ? (Or like Indian buses. No schedule). 4. For travel between cities how early I need to book train/bus ticket ? Which website can I use to book ? 5. Any concern on snatching/pickpocketing? 6. My plan is saigon - DMZ - da nang/hoi an / hue - Hanoi - ninh bin - cat ba island. Is it ok or shall I add something? Exit from Hanoi airport. Max I can spend 3 to 4 weeks.

He carries epi pens with him.\n However, people are often confused by the translated message and we think it’s not clear. \n Using google translate from English to viet to English, “no nuts, no sesame” returns as “no seeds. Unseasoned” which isn’t helpful at all hahaha.\n Also nuts can translate to peanuts but he is allergic to all nuts and nut oils. Sesame also seems to have multiple translations.\n A translation of something like “I can’t eat nuts, nut oils, sesame, sesame oil. Does this food contain them?” would be ideal! :D \n thank you for any help!!\n Edit If you’re interested hes only eating a small bite of food then waiting 5-10 mins for a reaction to be safe. if he reacted he would make himself throw it up.

We’ve been dating for over six months and the relationship has gotten serious.\n I love him (surprisingly, his family also loves me) and it’s looking like things might end in marriage down the line. I’m amazed they accept me so easily when my family doesn’t accept him, but I try my best anyway. His family wants everyone to live together someday soon. My boyfriend says no.\n My boyfriend has a rebellious spirit. His cousin bought me VN government-issued textbooks to study the language, but he doesn’t want to teach me Vietnamese manners. It leads to awkward situations with his family A LOT. He says “just be yourself, it’s America!” but I want his family’s approval.\n His parents were very poor in VN and are very traditional. My family is rich and has more advanced manners than average Americans. I grew up with my grandparents too, so I act and dress more like an older lady. It’s funny because sometimes I act like a polite American to his parents and they say to my boyfriend “she has Vietnamese manners, nice”. I’m totally uneducated but I know I offend them a little sometimes. \n For example, he didn’t tell me I should offer his parents to eat before I eat their food. Things like that. \n Please, if anyone has information on how not to offend Vietnamese parents, tell me. I never dress provocatively or curse, and I try to be as helpful as possible in the kitchen. My boyfriend’s family gives me a lot of patience as a westerner, but I want to do the right thing.\n Thank you 💗\n    submitted by    /u/Impossible_Biscotti3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Really embarrassed to talk about this. I’m not looking for sympathy. I just wanted to warn other travellers about this.\n I’m a foreigner from London. Have been using a dating app here. I noticed there are some girls on the app who are very eager to meet right away and go for a drink. Stupidly, I agreed to go with one this evening.\n She told me to meet her around the corner from Sniff club. Met her, looked nothing like her photos (which hardly showed her face anyway). She led us to this club.\n She didn’t even speak English and we communicated via google translate…\n She said she wanted to drink champagne 🤦🏼‍♂️ so I bought a bottle. Then she asked if she can do some balloons, and kept asking for more and more. At one point she suggested I tip the bar staff. \n She was super flirty and touching me all over. Until I said no to more balloons she acted like a grumpy child.\n I noticed some girls who were waiting on the corner, who later on were in the same club with some foreigner men.\n I am quite sure these girls are employed by the club to get men to come in and spend money. My total bill was 5 million…\n It’s a sad feeling to be taken advantage of like this. Everyone I’ve met so far has been so kind and generous to me.\n So yea, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is!\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Maybe_8945  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In a particular marketing team, there is a supervisor who holds the same number of years of work experience as the other team members but demonstrates less competence. It is evident to everyone in the office that the supervisor is the CEO's favorite employee. Whenever the CEO makes an insensitive joke, if the supervisor reacts poorly, the CEO apologizes. However, if anyone else in the team reacts negatively, the CEO calls them out, expressing dissatisfaction with their response.\n Interestingly, it was the supervisor who recently fired a colleague, but the CEO publicly supported the decision, attributing it to himself. This situation suggests that the CEO is protecting the supervisor by taking responsibility for the dismissal. This lack of transparency creates an unbalanced power dynamic within the office. After the incident, the office became dull.\n Moreover, the supervisor constantly seeks to know what others are doing, including questioning their work methods. This behavior can be bothersome, especially when team members are competent and experienced. For instance, one team member was surprised when the supervisor asked for assistance with a basic marketing task, such as scheduling social media posts. It is disconcerting when someone in an executive role lacks knowledge of fundamental marketing tools.\n These observations raise my concerns about power dynamics within the team. The supervisor appears to be favored, even with her limited competence, while others are held to a different standard. Additionally, the CEO's protection of the supervisor and the supervisor's micromanagement tendencies suggest an abuse of power. \n    submitted by    /u/DelusionalBroccoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every fucking time, it’s just karaoke noise. Those men whining and “singing”. This also happened in the afternoon when they sing for the fucking NEIGHBORHOOD. I feel cold ans my head aches. Why do people love karaoke so much? don’t they have any human decency? Don’t they think about the consequences of their action?\n    submitted by    /u/CuteCowdy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was recently travelling in Southeast Asia and I was shocked by the behaviour of people (especially Vietnamese) regarding trash and plastic. I saw so many people (young and old) simply throwing their trash onto the street: people eating chips and dropping the bag in the sidewalk, a man putting deodorant and tossing it to the middle of the road, plastic bottles, bags, cans of drinks… basically litter everywhere. \n This is particularly disturbing in big cities like Hanoi and Saigon, which are apparently developed and everyone has a phone and internet, but no one seems to have environmental awareness about reducing and recycling their waste.\n I can understand that old habits die hard and older people continue doing that, but the younger ones seem to follow that path as well. \n Also, the amount of plastic is insane. Is there really a need to get a drink in a plastic cup, inside a plastic bag, sealed with a plastic lid and drink it from a plastic straw? Even if you drink it on the spot and not take away, they will still put the plastic lid with a machine. On top of that, after finishing the drink, all that plastic ends up being dumped on the street.\n I’m no environmental “freak” or entitled European, but I’m genuinely curious if this is an issue being addressed by Vietnamese people (in schools, public campaigns) or if they simply don’t care. Has there been any improvement in recent years? Do you think there will be?\n    submitted by    /u/DefinitionFlaky3448  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not by the landscape and nature but rather by the accessibility and availability of tracks. I went hiking near Da Lat and Phan Thiet, which was great, but although the north is a lot more mountainous, they were barely accessible due to dense forests and lack of paths. Sometimes there was \"too easy\" access, which attracts tourists (e.g., viewpoint in Ninh Binh). Ofc Fansipan is an option but I'd rather do the tour by myself without a guide, also I heard it's quite touristic.

I would like to get her Get Well flowers.\n In the past I messed up by getting white flowers for my gf on Valentine's days. Supposedly her mom was not happy about it being white, because white is suppose to be used during a passing.\n What would be an appropriate color for flowers for this occasion?\n Appreciate the help!\n    submitted by    /u/potatobananalover  \n [link]   [comments]",
