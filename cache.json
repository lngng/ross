Every house/apartment I've lived in, my PC case or peripherals like microphone or any metallic parts will discharge a painful static shock to the part that touches my person. \n I've checked online to make sure I did everything within my control, things like no carpet under the CPU, new power cables, quality extension plugs and no stray exposed cables touching the case. \n Wall plugs here doesn't have the 3 hole option so that's telling me something is not grounded hence the shocks. \n If it helps, my microphone gives out a permanent static white noise with or without my voice activating the microphone, tested by using the \"listen to this device function. \n Questions: \n  \nShould I change my PSU? \n \nShould I call the electrician to come and ground my house properly (I recently built a new house)? \n \nAre there any work arounds for those who experienced the same problem? \n \nGamers with gaming laptops, do you get shocks from your laptops while its charging? (I am seriously considering getting a laptop because of this problem but I am unsure if it makes any difference because of the lack of grounding) \n \n Any help is greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/10ballplaya  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m going to rant here because this happened on a VietJet flight, but I’ve noticed other Asian airlines have the same stupid rules.\n The 7kg cabin baggage limit doesn’t make any sense! It’s supposed to be the combined limit for the carry-on and the personal item, but both are usually over this limit. Any carry-on under 7kg would be mostly empty. \n I don’t care if an airline wants to make more money and charge more. They can certainly do so, but they should have reasonable rules and clear prices.\n I just had a bad experience checking in to a VietJet flight where the employe made me empty my carry-on and put half of the things in my big bag and half in my backpack. They checked in my big bag which was now slightly over the 20kg limit and my almost empty carry-on. They kept telling me to make my backpack lighter, but it was that heavy because of my laptop, iPad and battery pack which can’t be checked in because they contain lithium batteries. I kept asking them what to do, but even they didn’t know the solution and eventually just let me go.\n    submitted by    /u/usdavor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "👋 hello. American looking for authentic cha gio here in the states. Specifically, many Vietnamese restaurants use egg-based (yellow) roll wrap paper and not the clear, white rice paper. I was always told that the yellow one was the Chinese way of making them, and that proper cha gio were made with the clear ones. (Is this true?) Personally, I prefer the clear white wraps 100% of the time. I’m disappointed when I order cha gio in a restaurant and I get the yellow kind. Does anyone know how I can ask what kind of paper they use and what answer reflects my preferences? Will a Vietnamese restaurant look at me sideways for even asking?\n Thanks!\n Background: American, but my (White) grandmother was born and raised in Vietnam. Our family has since adopted some Vietnamese dishes as part of our family culinary traditions, including thit koh, bun thit, and cha gio. Looking to maintain those family traditions in the way I was taught. 😊\n    submitted by    /u/BasicWasabi  \n [link]   [comments]",

There were about 30 of us, and although we can’t see a thing, we have excellent hearing and some of us speak English.\n So we were seated around various tables and we heard this foreign guy seeming to have a great time with his female friends. There were all just chatting and we figured out that he was gay and they were out having a “ladies day” of sorts. He was joking around with them and gossiping like one of the girls. He kept saying stuff like “no betch” and “that’s right girl, he ain’t all that”.\n Then we heard the sound of another foreigner and he also sounded effeminate. He seemed to be trying to flirt with the first guy. The first guy suddenly pretended to be all macho and changed his voice. We were like bruh.\n We heard what sounded like hands grabbing plump body parts and we heard some kissing. Then the other gay guy got even madder and was saying stuff like “you know you don’t like them, you big faker” and then we heard footsteps storming off.\n So we all just chuckled and went on with our meal.

          "description": "Just a fun story I wanted to share, no offense to anyone who digs the style I‘m going to talk about.\n My dad migrated from Vietnam 30 years ago and what striked me almost my whole adolescent life was his particular style of clothing. Like everything has a luxury brand name on it. All in all it it’s this kind of „young money“ street style from 2010. Sunglasses, caps, LV satchel, expensive watch, you name it, paired with buddhist accessories. From a fashion standpoint it’s completely randomly combined. This stands out even more since no other 60 year old man dresses this way in the country I grew up in. Though I’d say especially migrant groups tend to do that as well as a status symbol though there‘s something, besides the jade bracelets and stuff, that makes it so different and I really can‘t say what.\n And then, in 2019, I visited Vietnam for my first time. And when I walked around Bui Vien street or took the local busses, I’ve seen other middle aged men that radiated some thuggish ominous vibe like bouncers and I realized They wear the same outfits!! I don‘t know what exactly made it so similar but the composition of their outfits reminded me immediately of my dad. I had the feeling they wore even more accessories like a watch but also a jade bracelet and a wooden pearl bracelet on the same arm. It‘s so weird hahaha but now I know, where he got that inspiration from\n    submitted by    /u/eggisch  \n [link]   [comments]",

She is from vietnam and started a successful nail salon in the United States with her family. I was chatting with her and I said the acetone solution looks like Kool aid and she said she doesn't know what Kool aid is and has never had it. As gross as it may sound to some Kool aid was a big part of my life growing up and while I don't drink it in adulthood since its not the best for you I still love it. Would it be rude for me to bring her some? Unopened obviously. I feel like it may come across as rude or making fun of her and that is NOT my intention. I'm posting this here because I'm unaware of the nuances in Vietnamese culture surrounding gift giving and such.

          "description": "I rented an apartment from VXH, a government high ranking manager, possibly some general. The apartment is in Mipec complex, Hà Đông, Hà Nội. When I vacated the place, he visited the place and confirmed that he will return the deposit. He carried on my duty to pay the bills and lèa the house. Later on, he also replied a message to return the money on Oct 12. However, it has been a month since, and he has not returned the deposit. He refused my phone calls and never reply his reason not to return the money. Since sueing or asking for money is potentially problematic, I want to ask. 1. is it ok to ask his friends/wife/people at his place for his whereabouts? 2. how to sue now that I left Hà Nội and can't return. Would the government office, whatever that handles the case request me to be in Hanoi to carry on with the case? I also have heard that his wife works in the court and this will most likely thrown out. So how to make sure that the case will go. 3) there are many laws, on of which is the notorious 331 that puts people in prison for supposedly defamation of character. Their law in defamation of character is not like in the States - I have no profit or ill intention to do this beside getting my money.

I was on the back of a fast-moving motorbike when I randomly looked up at the sky and saw many flashing, color-changing circles like these. These are original videos and ones that have been made to slow motion so you can see everything in different speed. At first, I thought they were lights from a crane on a high-rise building, so I looked away. But a few seconds later, I looked up again and wondered “what? hold on…” how there could be such a high building in the sky! I tried to take a photo but couldn't because the bike was moving too fast, so I recorded videos instead. It looked very surreal and strange in person. I've never seen anything like this before. Did anyone else passing by that area tonight look up and see the same thing? Could these be drones?

          "description": "I left Vietnam with my mom when I was a baby. My dad died drowning in the sea trying to escape a year before us. \n I've been in Vietnam for two weeks now and I was actually quite surprised by how much poverty there still is here. It seems that so many people are struggling and making so little money. The diet, stress, sunlight exposure seem to all contribute to the population having smaller bodies/frames and looking much older than their counter parts in the west. I'm 5'11\" with a muscular build and I feel like freaking captain America walking around here. \n All this makes me very grateful for my life. But I also feel guilty because I realize everything I have was given to me. I didn't choose to the west. I am just a product of my parents and environment. It was my mere chance that I am where I am and who I am. One little change in my past, like my mom deciding not to try to escape or getting caught escaping and I could be in saigon trying to hustle like everyone else here. \n I am also saddened to see how much Vietnamese ppl struggle and work so hard in this ungodly humid and hot temperature. It seems like they have so few opportunities to advance and make a better life. \n I have heard things are slowly changing though. More people are able to get higher education and the middle class is growing. I hope when I come back in ten years things will be much more different. \n As viet kieus, do you guys feel the same gratitude and guilt as I do?\n    submitted by    /u/pally_hater_9854  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're currently in Vietnam for the first time and although it's exciting here, I'm getting tired of a few things that we're not used to. Almost every day we have been here, the locals try scamming us. From the street sellers who give me less change money than I'm supposed to get, the \"take a photo with my fruit basket on a stick\" and then heckling you to give photo money or buy something, \"take a free donut\", etc. It's wearing me down as I'm a very honest person and have tried my entire adult life to support little mom and pop shops with their businesses. We just spent 2 months in korea and a week in Japan and those locals were very honest, did not heckle, and if they offered a free sample, it was really free. Plus the lack of consideration. Last night at 1:30am, there is construction still going on like a circular saw and banging metal. I wake up to it, and have to sleep with it. Does the police or other locals not care about quiet sleeping time? We have never encountered something like this on a constant basis in any other country we've traveled to.\n We are scheduled to leave here next week, then off to Ho Chi Mihn for a week, and then after that we had scheduled Da Nang for a whole month but now considering canceling Da Nang if it's going to be more of the same. So for people who have traveled to Da Nang, can you tell me if we will be facing the same situation as here in Old Quarter Hanoi?\n ​\n We have met some really nice people in nice shops who offer us good service and the right change so we have been returning to those spots to eat. There's a coconut/smoothie spot we enjoy so everyday we buy 5 drinks.\n    submitted by    /u/EndTheFedBanksters  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel a little bit embarrassed to try to push this new project out there but what do I have to lose then to share my experience right?\n I am so thankful for the people who voted in the poll and gave their opinions. It really helped me narrow down my focus. This is a passion project that stemmed from a long overdue trip to Vietnam.\n I was born in a refugee camp in Malaysia and moved to Canada when I was 4. I only been to Vietnam once when I was 14 on a family trip. Then this year back in April I decided to go back to Vietnam on my own at the age of 30. It was an incredible experience reconnecting with family and making new friends as a solo traveler who can barely speak Vietnamese. I have to say that Vietnamese locals are so open and love to connect with foreigners - I think that's what makes the country so great!\n Anyways, I got a felt tote bag from a popular Men's wear brand there and walked around with it in Canada, constantly getting compliments on the bag. I decided to start my own brand selling these felt tote bags with my own designs. Right now the designs and branding is focused on the soft \"Asian\" girl aesthetic but I hope to venture beyond these tote bags to explore different aspects of being Vietnamese living outside of Vietnam. I feel that we are constantly trying to connect to heritage while building a unique Western-Vietnamese experience navigating two cultures.\n I hope you guys follow The New Win on social media and check out the website: bythenewwin.com.\n As you can see the poll winner \"Saigon District 1\" inspired the first design. I'm gearing up for the first Drop soon and I hope you check back for more Drops in the future.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/wowelephants  \n [link]   [comments]",

But on Sunday pictures were published in state media of an enormous construction site running through the waters – and next to the spectacular karsts – of Bai Tu Long Bay, which borders Ha Long.\n https://preview.redd.it/qx30sp82w8zb1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a5fb02c727f2e9c8d1592c76ff464a22ce0b3c\n https://preview.redd.it/ybid9i17w8zb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb5e2dc9c1995a35b2e91560842536e4fccde809\n  \n [link]   [comments]",

I contacted some co-working spaces, which would be perfect because they charge by the day, but they don't offer any hardware (monitor, keyboard and a mouse).\n Another option would be to go to a gaming cafe and just plug their hardware into my laptop. Has anyone done that?\n Would renting the equipment be an option? Tried googling, but only a single really expensive option came up. Buying doesn't work as I will be traveling around Vietnam. \n There should be quite a lot of digital nomads in Vietnam, so someone has to have dealt with the same problem. Didn't find any on this subreddit tho.\n Thanks!\n PS! I'll probably face the same problem in January at Da Nang, so any info on the way of the land over there would also be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Leading_Carpenter890  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are the glucose levels recommended to follow? \n I’m a vietnamese American living in America and currently pregnant with our first baby. Recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have to meet glucose levels set by American medical institutes. Given that I’m ethnically Asian and grew up eating Asian food at home and maintain Việt culture at home life- I am apt to believe a lot of the American medical standards don’t fit me as I’m not the same genetic or dietary background as most of their standards which is collective studies base on the “average” white person (since white ppl make up the majority of the population in america) so was curious what vietnam did for gestational diabetes \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Passing_squarebubs  \n [link]   [comments]",

My viet is crap and I wasn't able to find so many articles on it.

They were still a small kingdom that only gained independence 100 years ago and were attacking the strongest empire on earth at the time.

He told me to wait in the waiting area. I was very nervous since it's the first time that my baggage was questioned. And I kept thinking of worst case scenario like finding illegal items and being fined etc. I was waiting for a few minutes and asked politely (saying \"Sir\") and he said that the staff from the airline is arriving. There's no one at the security screening at that point and after several minutes, asked him politely again, and then he shouted in a loud aggressive voice \"I TOLD YOU TO WAIT HUH. WAIT!! \" and I was shocked by that aproach. Even his fellow staff looked at him. \n I was shaken by his aggressive reply and just sat in my seat while he just turned his back at me. Fortunately, the airline staff arrived and accompanied me at the baggage screening. It was a pocket wifi and it's carry on only. After clearing, I went to other side of security and went to boarding gates.\n (Also earlier, the lady at the check-in counter seems very testy, the way she processed the check-in procedures) \n The staff at Saigon Airport seems to be in a lot of stress and not very friendly. I really had a bad experience on this Airport and it made a pretty bad impression as a visitor, , unlike the ones in Hanoi and Da Nang.. Honestly, from the attitude of staff and the whole airport experience (queueing, check-in), it's much worse than the comparable NAIA (Manila) T3.

I'm a medium paced traveller, don't take things too slow but neither rush through the trip. \n I'm into cozy hotels (not too expensive), historical sites & museums, local food, drinks & coffee places. I'm not a nightlife person and usually stay away from crazy spots - doesn't mean that I don't like to visit and see them for a couple hours. I want to make the best out of my Vietnam trip. \n I'm planning the following route in my Vietnam trip for so many days:\n Hanoi 4\n Ha Long Bay 2 (Here I plan a one night trip where they come pick you up from hotel and return you the next day - any agency you'd recommend? looking at prices online I expect around 350 euro pp)\n Ninh Binh 2 (Saw that can be done as a day trip but many people recommend spending the night)\n Sapa 3 (Here is the most uncertain part of the trip, not sure if worth spending the 6 hours of train/bus to reach here, stay 1 full day, and return the 3rd day - any experiences on how to proceed best?) \n Hanoi 1 (coming back from Sapa and prepare for flight to Da Nang)\n Da Nang/Hue/Hoi An 5 (any idea how many days I should spend in each? I'm reading that Hoi An would be the best out of these 3 cities so I don't mind cutting 1 city to spend more time in Hoi An) \n HCMC 3 \n Phu quoc/ Con Dao 4 (I still have to decide which of the islands I should go to - price wise flight from HCMC is similar but I'm reading plenty of negative stuff on Phu Q so I'm leaning more towards Con Dao).\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/EvenPatience6243  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't suffer any loss, and I knew that he was just an ordinary office worker who just wanted to complete his work.\n I guess maybe more people joined the tour group, but they didn’t have enough train tickets, so they randomly selected a few lucky passengers like us and lied to them.

He started scribbling something on a piece of paper so I assumed he wanted to charge me for the parking. I told him to show me some kind of ID but he wouldn’t so I told him to get lost and just left the bike there. On my way back I realised he’s moved the bike to the middle of the road. I’ve got a few questions:\n  \nDo these people charge money for parking?\n \nIf so, on what basis? Like, do they own the parking spaces?\n \nIf they do charge, do I just trust any random looking dude here and hand them in my money?\n \nWhat is his job exactly, how does anyone benefit from his services?\n \n Also I do apologise if I just broke some social standards. The only similar experience I’ve had was in Naples where local drug addicts demand money for parking, and I’ve been advised by my Italian friend to just ignore them. I would really like to know how to deal with this here in Vietnam.\n    submitted by    /u/rax94  \n [link]   [comments]",

The service, akin to Netflix, brought a plethora of international films and TV shows to Vietnamese screens. But come October 2023, active subscriptions will be cancelled, and full refunds will be issued. Additionally, Prime Gaming benefits will also become inaccessible.\n  \nWhile Amazon remains silent on the rationale behind this closure, industry insiders speculate Vietnamese regulations may hold the key. The country mandates transnational paid broadcasting services to obtain licenses—a hurdle that Amazon seems unwilling to surmount.

You don’t disrespect neither do you have a demeanor where someone can try to undermine or disrespect you, maybe the years of war and made you so strong yet so humble. Money is the basis of all economies yet in your country, majority folk don’t give it the importance it’s given the world over. Food was so fresh and the amount of fruits you eat and the fresh seafood shows on your flawless skins. The women take the cake in hard work and yet manage to look so elegant in whatever they wear, they are such boss ladies it’s commendable. There are other countries in South Asia which have built economies on sex work, yet yours keeps its head held high and aims to give a more wholesome experience to any visitor.\n I write this from my bed in India, sad and depressed at having come back from such a lovely country which I wish was like my second home!\n Thank you Vietnam 🇻🇳 🙏🏻\n    submitted by    /u/blacksabath60  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was pointed out that this building did not meet JITCO regulations even before it was built, but this company stated that this was not a problem because Vietnamese people live in worse conditions in their home countries. But the regulation that the minimum bedroom size per person should be 4.5 m2 on average was established. In response to this issue this company made a donation of 4 million to Yoshitaka Shindo.

          "description": "I never like taking taxis anyway, I usually use Grab but my mom is a little more old-fashioned so whenever I’m traveling with her at the Tan Son Nhat airport she insists on using a taxi. She is Native Viet and I am Việt kiều. \n First time, they scammed us to pay double/triple a normal fare price (and I know taxis to and from airport are already higher end, so it was double that price already). \n Second time I gave them the hotel address, which was a chain hotel. Dude didn’t want to drive across town and said this particular chain accepts any reservation at any of their locations so he dropped us off at the hotel chain spot close to the hotel. I was already suspicious when he said this, but my mom accepted it readily and didn’t argue. She’s been living in Vietnam for over two years now for retirement and also grew up here, so if she thought it was fine I wasn’t going to argue either, especially since I was exhausted from a long flight. Obviously it turned out not to be true and the hotel receptionist said as much and called us a cab to our actual hotel reservation. \n Even after these two incidents my mom still goes to the taxis when leaving the airport as she says there are no other options. However, to book a Grab car to pickup from airport you just have to walk to the airport parking lot and they’ll pick you up from there. She struggles with technology and apps though and still feels more comfortable using the taxis even knowing they’re overpriced and scammy. But for anyone who’s comfortable with using apps and booking a Grab, go for that option. Teach the older folk how to use it too. These taxis are atrocious.\n    submitted by    /u/vavido  \n [link]   [comments]",

One dude looks like he’s day drunk, the other officer cleared 3-4 people while he cleared only one. Elderly people and crying babies standing in line for hours. Every officers look visibly pissed off. What a great way to welcome foreigners to our country. This officer got my blood boiling when he physically push a Japanese tourist back in line, the tourist was simply chatting with his group because they have to wait 2 hours in line. He later show extreme irritation to the dude, slam his passport on the table in a rude manner. The Japanese tourist was in shock. Godd!!! It pissed me off everytime I land in this god forsaken ass place. Not to mention getting a taxi out of the airport.

Perhaps with a different company, or if there were a different demographic of people in my tour group, I would have stuck it out, but my gut is telling me to leave. Some odd things have happened that are not just related to the party culture. These people are racist. Guys, always trust your gut.\n Hi all, I (20F, poc) scheduled a Ha Giang easy rider loop tour through a hostel after all the rave reviews online. I arrive, and quickly realize that this is all just one big excuse for young white European people to drink and party. I felt extremely uncomfortable my first night here, before the tour starts, as I did not come to Vietnam to drink with strangers, don’t like these people in my group, and am uninterested in the tourist drinking and partying scene. I don’t know why I didn’t do better research to see what a terrible tourist trap Ha Giang has become. I wanted a beautiful nature motorbike tour, but I am thinking of canceling because I don’t want to drink and don’t want to be the only person of color in the group, already half-excluded.\n Has anyone felt the same way when visiting Southeast Asia, and how did you avoid this? I’m here to travel solo, decompress, enjoy nature and different cities and locals, not interested in making friends with other tourists.\n And now, I’m not sure what to do. Is the loop still worth it if I don’t want to party at night and just feel uncomfortable with the people in my group? I’m thinking of just bailing and going back to Hanoi, which I loved.\n    submitted by    /u/Personal-Elevator-88  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well me and my mom thought about it and we’d like to avoid just that in the future. \n Backstory: my mom is Vietnamese but lives in Sweden. Her brother is holding either half (or on the contract, currently holding) her house for her until she retires and moves there in the future. Now grown up and having seen my family members patterns, I’m almost too sure that a conflict will arise in the future from this. Mainly between my moms brother, and his wife. The two aren’t too fond of each other. Another red flag I noticed during a trip to VN one summer was that my uncle started tearing up and making a whole scene in front of everyone when my mom just calmly asked for her name to also be included on the papers for the house. He was screaming about being accused of being greedy when no one approached it that way. I felt like he was scared and projecting. \n Any advice is appreciated. I’d hate to see my family members fight over four walls in the future. \n PS. This property was gifted to specifically my mom from her parents.

It didn't have a very \"pick up\" style feel to it at all. \n There is a gymnasium in District 3 and you need to rent that one out as well. Apparently, the Ho Chi Minh City Wings play at this location. \n I haven't even looked at District 1 yet, but I'm starting to kind of feel you need to rent a whole court out to get anything going.\n Maybe we can get a group going of at least 10 of us getting together to rent a court out together. I'm just trying to run 5 vs 5 for an hour or so to get a good work out in. \n I'm going to try Phu Tho again because today might have just been a wierd off day as last time I was there, it actually felt like a normal park where people just rolled up and started playing pick up.\n I know basketball is not very big in Vietnam but for a developing city with 9 million people in it, I expected more out of the basketball community.\n    submitted by    /u/swooosh47  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every once in a while you run into someone who’s kinda old, but not that old, and you don’t know if you should call them anh or chú. \n Same with the women: idk if they’re old enough for me to call them cô or chị without offending them\n Edit: Just remembered something else about pronouns so figured I’ll blow y’all mind. \n Within the family tree of Vietnam, you call your cousins anh/chị/em, not based on age but based on your parents age. In other words, if my father has a younger brother, and they both have children, my uncle’s kid would have to call me anh/chị regardless of age. This means it is possible that I am anh/chị even if I’m the younger cousin!!\n Another thing is if within a family tree, a person is on the same generation as your parents, you call them cô/dì/chú/bác. So for a large family with 1st generation of 5, it is possible to have some people of the 2nd generation younger than some people in the 3rd generation!!

I also gave something back to him.\n I told him I consider buying a car , because I’ld settle down here in Hanoi. Then, two weeks later, a new Mercedes was sent to my apartment . Now, I have no idea how to buy something back to him. That Mercedes is worth over 2 billions VND. I don’t have billions to spend on a gift. \n My dad always teaches me “never take anything for free in Vietnam”. I can’t ask my dad for much money though. We are just dating, and I am not his wife.

          "description": "Sorry if my question is phrased wrongly, but I do not know how to phrase it better. As a westerner (or in this case, a person born from Vietnamese parents, but raised in the US), I never really engaged with the Vietnamese language and many of its cultural products (other than the food, but that is a given). \n I never really watch any Vietnamese shows or musics because it looked poorly made compared with other things, like American/Western sitcoms and anime. And looking at the posts on this subreddit, I see that the younger generation of Vietnam is also seem to take more interest in K-Pop, Anime, and other cultural media than their home media. So in that case, why should I take time to learn Vietnamese to engage with the media that even the younger generation seems to not take interest in? \n I know this question sounds superficial (and it is) and there are many reasons to learn Vietnamese (talk to relatives and the people of Vietnam, learn the ethmology/history of the language, just have knowledge of Vietnamese under your belt, etc. ), but many times the reason why a person learns about a culture and the language of that culture is because they engage with something in the culture that sparks them to learn more about the culture. But I do not see that spark personally. Vietnamese is not the spoken language in the world (meaning it is not really a global business language), doesn't really have a huge art/film scene, and vietnamese culture in general does not really spark a huge influence across the globe. So why should I learn Vietnamese?\n    submitted by    /u/greedson  \n [link]   [comments]",

We tried googling such agency and nothing comes up and again we don't have the confirmation from such agency either. We tried to argue we have not booked through an agency and again she refused to help us as she said we had booked through this so called agency that does not exist. \n We are 100% sure we booked with Vietnam airlines and we don't know what to do now. We have contacted the other department she mentioned but there's only an email we could contact. \n It feels like we are being scammed by the airline and not being helped. \n Has anyone had this issue before?\n Update: We were able to change it through this new email we received.

It takes place in the 1920’s-40’s era and I’d love to get advice/opinions/resources for research on this character. I want her family to have moved to the USA when she was young (maybe around 12? She was born in 1892) But I’d love to know what kind of traditions the family might follow and bring with them to the states, what immigration was like at the time, etc. I know there were immigration rules in place at the time that might affect them and France was involved in colonialism in Vietnam at the time. I’ve had trouble finding any information on Vietnamese immigration to the USA before the war. I’d also like to be told about any history I should know that would affect this story, what people want me as a white writer to avoid when making a Vietnamese character, and what people want to see when it comes to Vietnamese women in fiction. So far I have her name as Chau Tahn Liên and I’ve named a few of her family members like her brothers, sister, parents, aunt and uncle, cousin, and paternal grandparents. I’d love to know if the name makes sense especially for the time or if i should make changes and what they should be.

We’ll be staying in Sa Pa for 2 days (more or less), and we’re looking for a trekking route to do that is not crowded. In fact, we’re looking for a medium-hard trekking (we’re young and fit) where we’re not gonna be surrounded by tons of people. Is it possible to sleep in the mountain with a tent?

She has paid for dates before on a few occasions (in fact, she paid for our first one), but I would say it's 90-10 in terms of costs between her and I. I was told this was the norm in Vietnam for dating...but is it always? What about for long-term relationships or marriage?\n Recently, I broached the issue.

I will be there for 3 weeks with arrival in Saigon and departure in Hanoi.\n I’m open to feedback on my itinerary from all of you travel experts/expats/locals. I have zero expectation on following this itinerary 100% since I know that’s not feasible and unforeseen situations may arise. I like to have my days planned out so that I’m not scratching my head on what to do when I get there.\n I enjoy food as you can tell from the amount of food tours but also enjoy activities and nature/scenery. If you have any recommendations outside of what is on my itinerary, please share. All recommendations for attractions/restaurants/coffee shops/street food/shopping centers/markets would be appreciated. Also if you guys know of any pedestrian friendly/walking areas that are not on my itinerary, please let me know. I like to explore on foot but also know that Vietnam is not the most walk friendly country.\n Is 3 days too long for Ninh Binh? I like that cycling is a great option to explore the area but will I run out of things to do?\n Thanks in advance\n https://preview.redd.it/lrcfbguaztwb1.png?width=2380&format=png&auto=webp&s=920d4459690d436236e8a2016d2593fd3677fd82\n https://preview.redd.it/4ebggguaztwb1.png?width=2380&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e564df5b0982ec0e83aae2c5559e568a22ab04e\n https://preview.redd.it/cdxxgkuaztwb1.png?width=2380&format=png&auto=webp&s=853282043360257784f8f30dca658d93468cb41b\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Day9509  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I do a lot of bike and bikepacking in France so I'm pretty ok with that).\n I didn't have any driver licence so I can't rent a powerful motorbike, and I don't want to have any issues with the local police\n I'm also planning to stay in \"homestay\" like; guesthouses; etc\n So I had a few questions:\n -Can I find a long-term (3 weeks) for a 50cc scooter in Ho Chi Minh City or maybe buy one ? I wonder what's the best solution.\n -Did the road/dirt road are practicable on a 50cc scooter or a bike ?\n -Did you have any advice about the project ?\n I already look on internet, but I can't find so much infos on the Mekong Delta and backpacking it.\n Thanks all for your answers !\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/ArtbiVN  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been to both cities previously, as well as Da Nang & Hue. So I’ve basically seen most of the touristy stuff there (including Ha Long Bay) and have decided to skip central VietNam entirely this time around.\n I’m thinking of making a side trip to Sapa while up north and potentially Da Lat or the Mekong delta while in HCMC. \n Is two days in Sapa enough time to see most things there or should I add an extra day? Is Da Lat worth checking out for two days or so? How about the Mekong delta? I know both cities are pretty touristy and I can live with that. I just want to check out new places and get out of the hustle of the big cities. \n Since I’ve done Hanoi and HCMC, I just plan on chilling, eating while there so my days spent in the smaller cities is flexible. \n Also, I know the weather is hot/humid year round, but should I expect rain during this time of year?\n Thanks for any suggestions or recommendations!\n    submitted by    /u/H_ade_s  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was on STEM OPT, and my employer was willing to sponsor my H1-B visa. \n Things were looking up for a bit, and I thought I could settle in America. However, my health worsened in September 2022, and I was constantly sick every month. I got a serious case of vertigo that made me spend a day in the ER in August. And then, a month later I got diagnosed with H Pylori, a nasty stomach virus that could cause severe heartburn. In December 2022, I got Covid after attending happy hour with my coworkers. I had to deal with all of these along with anxiety and depression. In March 2023, I decided to quit my job and move back to Vietnam because I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't even apply for the STEM extension or participate in the H1-B lottery. \n I moved to Saigon after coming back to Vietnam (I'm from Hanoi), but I still feel like a loser for coming back to Vietnam. When I set out to study in America, my goal was to get a job and a green card and then I would choose where to live. However, things didn't go as planned, and I am completely lost. I am scared of getting back into the corporate world because of what happened to me. I'm scared that my health will be in jeopardy again. I'm still looking and applying for jobs right now, but deep down I wish no one would hire me so that I could rest for a bit more. \n Now I'm completely lost because the goal that I had been working towards for 5+ years was squashed, and now I have no goals or directions.

          "description": "Hey guys! Just wondering if I did something wrong 4 weeks ago. I'm still pondering about it till this day. We moved in a hotel in the tourist area for a month and almost every night at this outside Huda bar there was a white puppy sitting on a folding chair. He had a leash and tip jar next to him and I would always go up and pet him (I asked if I could pet him every time). And I fell in love with the little guy. So one day I went to the pet store near by and bought some puppy sized toys to give to him. When I saw the puppy again a few days later I patted him and gave him a rope toy to play with and we tugged it and all that cute stuff. I left him with the toy and saw the puppy about a week later without it. I never saw him since then. Is it bad here to gift a dog a toy? I had no bad intent or anything I just wanted to treat him. :(\n    submitted by    /u/JealousEmergency9921  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I live in VN as foreigner. I know that vietnamese love karaoke and it's fine. Until they crank up the volume to absolutely outrageous level.\n I live in a very good place and very nice city, but unfortunately to me there are few villas nearby where drunk viet people like to sing karaoke almost every day up until midnight. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I understand they want to have fun. I understand they are drunk and don't care about other people.\n What I don't understand is why no one is doing anything about it? 20 drunk people affect thousands citizens who live nearby. Everyone is happy about noise? Can't believe it.\n Now the main part: there are four 5* star hotels near these villas. Classy, expensive, with good cars around it, etc et etc. Why management is doing nothing about drunkards in villas? It is so easy to call police. It is so easy to give them some money so they patrol this area a little more often. Submit complains, escalate problems to police superiors, even bribe if needed, etc etc. But why nothing? I live here for 6 months and problem doesn't go away. \n I have so many questions.\n Hotel customers don't complain even when karaoke blasts at midnight? Hotel management doesnt care about anyone? Police doesnt care about 5* star hotels?\n Maybe vietnamese customers dont care about noise even if they rich because they are used to karaoke from their childhood. But what about foreign customers who live in 5* hotels? They don't complain too? I can hardly believe foreigners love this noise while they pay big sums of money for fancy hotel.\n Can some explain me this mystery?\n    submitted by    /u/superfastracoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n Sooo, I am a 26yo art student, viet born in western europe and would love to explore some contemporary art spaces and the creative wave that’s been happening and just learn about the people and the culture.\n The thing is that I visited last summer, the first time in 15 years and was with family most of the time. This was a beautiful experience but also, I was super annoyed with how paranoid my family was about me doing stuff alone. I always needed someone of my family to be there with me or someone they knew to escort me around for the most simple things like getting a juice around the corner. \n The main thing they’re scared off is me being sold, kidnapped or deceived and drugged, because I’m recognizable as a Viet Kieu and am female. Sometimes I get mistaken for being fully foreigner, like Thai or Indonesian, cause I don’t look like the typical Viet when it comes to my style or my accent, or whatever reason they say I don’t look like a typical viet. (fam also say I’m too ‘hiện’ lol)\n The thing is, I just want to explore places, meet likeminded creatives and enjoy my culture outside of the family. But is it true that I’m not safe doing things on my own? Can I really not take Grab’s without the chance of being kidnapped? Can I really trust no one?\n My family be saying crazy stuff like ‘dont go on dates cause if you reject him, he’ll drug you’ or ‘white people have it easier in VN than Viet Kieu’ 🤡\n Anyway, thoughts? I just wanna explore new spaces and hang out with new people but how my family puts it; I’m in danger as a female not viet-born person doing things on my own.\n    submitted by    /u/_honeyloops_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone! My husband and I are visiting Vietnam this upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. We are planning a trip with my parents who live in Vietnam for 5 days during the 2 weeks before the holiday. My parents want to go from Quang Binh to Hoi An in 5 days. They want to visit Phong Nha Cave, Paradise Cave, Hoi An, Da Nang, and Hue. The plan is that we will land in Da Nang and travel with them immediately.\n  \nWe will not use a tour agency so I am a little afraid of how many destinations they want to go to within such a small timeframe. Definitely, we will use public transportation to commute and that takes a lot of time to commute already. \n The current itinerary: Quang Binh (1 day), Hue (1 day), Da Nang (1-2 day), and Hoi An (1 day)\n I hate jet lag and I want to take it slow to adjust to the local time when I first land. \n We would like to enjoy the trip rather than move through each location super fast. We are considering tailoring in Hoi An for our wedding and it seems to not be doable with this iterary.\n I heard Hoi An is super crowded and 2 out of 5 days we plan to travel are weekends. \n We love our parents but at the same time, we really want to visit Da Nang-Hoi An without rushing it.\n  \nDo you think this is a good idea? How can we commute between places if this trip is doable?\n I am gearing towards traveling to Ha Noi (3 days) and Halong Bay (cruise-2 days) so that we can experience the Northern vibe of the Tet holiday and enjoy more time on the trip.\n    submitted by    /u/kttrxn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been to Vietnam already and been to the Miu Miu spa and liked the massage there but it was a female masseur and I didn’t feel so comfortable with that. I’ve also been to the Tarzan spa but that was more like a hidden brothel and the „massage“ was really bad. Definitely not looking for a happy ending thing. Looking for a proper massage!\n Price range should be around 500k. Would appreciate any serious tips maybe someone knows a good place.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/e_a_arts  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I went to Vietnam in June for a few weeks with my wife and daughter. We went to Ho Chi Minh City, Que Nhon, and Dalat. We decided to buy insurance from Berkshire Hathaway Travel protection. We chose the coverage that only covered medical emergencies. The price was less than 100$. Mid way through our trip my daughter became very sick fever ect. She had a bacteria infection which landed her in the hospital for anti-biotics when over the counter did not do the trick. We stayed at Vinmec got receipts for everything and ended up staying in the hospital for 7 days. The cost for everything came out to around 3,000. Vinmec gave us all receipts in English and Vietnamese. I opened a case with Berkshire while on Vietnam and they said I had a year to send all docs. When we got home I sent all receipts and charges from my credit card they also asked for bank statements and after 25 days I received a check for the full amount. They covered the hospital stay, medicine, emergency room visit too. It was my first experience with Berkshire but will use them in the future. I recommended this to my friend that also went recently and she also has to take her daughter to the hospital it wasn't expensive but it sounds like it was covered her bill was only 300$\n    submitted by    /u/jackhammer1198  \n [link]   [comments]",

I said let’s meet in person for coffee next day, I noticed she kept asking to send the meeting address almost every hour but I said I’ll send next day before the meeting time.\n Eventually I texted her the cafe address and was waiting. She said she’s lost and trying to find the cafe, I video called her several times but she declined. So I felt maybe it’s a prank and left the cafe. \n When…",

We are super excited :) \n After exploring the country for a while, we would like to enjoy the beach and the sun before returning to -15°C and snow in Norway. After the beach we will go to HCM for NYE. \n We have looked at Phu Quoc, but I am reading a lot about construction and trash here on Reddit. We don't have the budget to stay at a super fancy resort, but could pay to stay at the beach during the day. It seems like the island fits our preference in terms of weather, but I would love your opinion on the island in December in general. \n Con Dao also seems interesting, if anyone has some input. \n We are looking for: beach, sun, chilling (but also some activites). \n I appreciate your help :)\n    submitted by    /u/kaskjera  \n [link]   [comments]",

I never experience this with Korean Americans back home, rich or middle class, so that’s why I’m so culture shocked by this behavior!\n Examples:\n Usually people move aside or try to avoid hitting the other person when walking opposite directions on a sidewalk.\n  \nI’ve been very harshly shoved by the shoulders or arms by Korean tourists who don’t even attempt to avoid me even when I try to avoid them. They’ll walk in a straight line, unwaivering, & will shove me hard then keep walking straight without looking back at who they hit. This has happened on multiple occasions where they can easily avoid hitting me as I try to avoid them.\n  \nWaiting\n  \nWhen waiting in line, I’ll just have a random Korean person shove their way in front of me as if I don’t exist. Same thing if I’m looking at something, but I’m standing to the side to allow others to walk by. \n They’ll stand close & right in front of the displays, blocking me even though it’s clear I’m looking & trying to grab something.\n  \nSeats\n  \nAt busy buffets, they’ll deny you sitting at the end of their empty table & far away by saying it’s full. Meanwhile, it’s empty the entire time we’re there. \n  \nI haven’t experienced that with British, American, or Uzbek tourists at all. It’s literally just native Koreans. It’s driving me nuts!

My wife can drive for a year with an IDP but eventually we plan to get a driver license for both of us. I am Vietnamese and my wife is not but she can communicate in Vietnamese decently.\n For me, I know absolutely nothing about driving a car (or about a car itself). I also want to learn to drive decently and safely and we will not bribe. What can we do to prepare ahead?

          "description": "So I carry this with me for quite a while already: \n I live in Vietnam, and a friend of mine, around 30, from a European country, told me in 2021 already the he need to get to Saigon to his embassy to get a new passport. Quite difficult during Covid, he also doesn’t have big cash to pay for the trip, so he kept on delaying it, until his passport ran out of validity. \n In early 2023 he made the trip to Saigon finally by taking the train, told me he can’t fly because no passport, so Train best option. When he came back from that trip a couple days later I asked him about passport and if he got his, he told me not yet, embassy have problems bla bla bla. \n Since then, he told me like three times on different occasions that he moved into a new place under his girlfriends name and kinda hides from immigration and doesn’t really care. If that’s true, we talking about a looooong overstay. \n So my question: \n 1.) I feel he‘s telling me BS, but why would make shit like that up. What’s the intention??\n 2.) Assume he‘s telling the truth, what „problems“ could his embassy make to not give him a new passport?\n 3.) Could he really „hide“ from VN police and just overstay months without them seeking for him / finding him? What’s the play here, they actively looking for him or just waiting and hope they catch him one day? He‘s not really „quiet“ about his situation so I know the circle of people Knowing is not small either and I just can’t imagine they not knowing and not caring and not finding.\n This whole story is so damn stupid and I can’t make sense of it. Really looking to hear some fresh opinions on that.\n Edit: Could be he meant „consulate“ instead, I know a lot of people use the word „embassy“ but actually meaning „consulate“, so that’s not the big issue here. \n Edit 2: Thanks for the replies guys!\n    submitted by    /u/medium_nice_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I left in 2012 and haven’t been back since - so I’m extremely excited to come back home! :) I’m sure I’ll be shocked at how much has changed! It’s also my girlfriend’s first time in the country. \n We’re going to be spending Christmas in HCMC (where I grew up), and before that well be in Hoi An. I’m wondering where we can go after for 1.5 weeks of relax. We want a nice beach destination with some beautiful properties, activities, maybe some historical sites, nice restaurants, and somewhere to celebrate the new year! \n When I was growing up, my parents and I would take quick weekend trips from HCMC to Mui Ne/Vung Tau for the beach, but I’m not sure these are the best options. \n We heard mixed reviews about Phu Quoc, but everyone is suggesting Da Nang! What do you all recommend? Keeping in mind it’s end of December/January. \n Any place in particular? Would appreciate ANY help! :)) \n Cam on!\n    submitted by    /u/morninglightshine  \n [link]   [comments]",

As such, there have not been many big events dedicated to this awesome hobby.\n Started out as a local event for tabletop gamers, we are bringing back Board Game Fest for the 3rd time, this time on a scale bigger than ever before. With 150 game tables, hundred of board games and several dozen of Game Master and staff, we hope this will be a welcoming event for everyone, young and old, Vietnamese and foreigners alike. There will be many booths with all the big board game coffees in Hanoi, leading board game publishers from Vietnam where you can experience their games/ services. Whether you are new to board game and want to try out some amazing-looking games; or want to check out some of our never-before-seen self-published titles; or just want to hang out and potentially meet someone who shares your interest, there is something for you at our event.\n The event venue will be at TH School - yes that's the beautiful pink building right on Chua Boc street. Book your tickets now to enjoy the best deal (we are only selling tickets to provide a big nice venue for the event). Details in the poster below!\n If you're anyway interested and have further question, feel free to reach me via PM or via our FB page. Our team want make this a meaningful annual event and help grow the tabletop community, so I really hope you will consider joining our tables, and hope we will have a great time together!!\n https://preview.redd.it/fjm72fi51rub1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a7a49c6a652d9115c67e07d89b425368b3675af\n    submitted by    /u/MarshMaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Crowed Cities like HCMC or Hanoi would be totally infected in just a couple of days considering the population density.\n Vietnamese dont have guns. So people would be defenseless. Its dangerous to engage zombies in a melee combat. Except groups of ex militants. But zombies are not good as traversing hard terrain. And Vietnam is full of such terrain,85% of territory is mountain so if you just go and make a settlement in a sloppy area. You should be safe. Except for anomalies.\n Best thing i can think of to do is go to high altitude area. A really high place.I would like move to North West or Tay Nguyen regions. Fansipan is a good choice.The Mainly hunting or can even cultivate if you have some offensive weapons to take dons a couple of zombies that might appear. My choice is live on the top of terraced fields so you never worry about food.Vietnam would be among the safest places against zombie.

Professor Ho Ngoc Dai, as a prominent figure in education reforming who had gone through the hard times in Vietnam, even consider children like a friend, once said \"if you consider them like a friend, then you can't scold them\". Unfortunately, majority of people in Vietnam and even ppl of my age still support this way of \"education\", like wtf how can you say you beat them because you \"care\" about them, which is total hypocrisy. And then the \"backthen we got beaten and that gave us success\" mentality, which is totally survivorship bias because those people only got like good job with average income, maybe higher because backthen there were more opportunities due to booming economy in early 90s and 2000s. And if the method works then why is corruption and crime is still rampant in the country? \n Of course this is a cultural issue, and I'm sure that many people may be triggered and even compare to the US or something. And yes, Vietnam is no doubt a part of sinosphere where collectivism and conservatism is widespread, people don't change much and clings to Confucian values much like the way Islamists clings to orthodox view.
