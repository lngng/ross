I'm going to make an effort to buy good gifts, and they are not cheap. My question is: is the first meeting more important or more special than the next ones? I mean, if I give them better gifts on the first meeting than on the second meeting, will it be strange? Or will they expect the gifts to become better and better? I'm very confused.

For Buddhas sake you’re at a temple. \n Then at Tac coc at Bai Dinh temple, signs are everywhere to be silent or quiet as possible. But these ladies are yelling screaming from a distance.

          "description": "My first week here, I pet my (then) fiancee's family's pet dog. The mutt bit me on the finger and I had to go for 5 rabies shots.\n It was a harrowing welcome to Vietnam, let's just say that!\n I've been chased by a couple aggressive dogs since that, and seen some wild looking dogs just roaming the streets that I don't want anything to do with. \n I refuse to pet or put myself in any sort of vulnerable position even with friendly dogs. \n I grew up with pet dogs in the west. To say I'm a dog lover is an understatement. I miss my family's dog so much while I'm here. \n I never would have thought that I would develop a fear of dogs, but I feel it growing every time I have to walk past an unknown dog on the street. \n Rabies scares me more than the dogs to be honest... \n Luckily the family dog didn't have rabies and is still alive. But 5 shots is really annoying to schedule around. Pretty cool they are only $2 though.\n    submitted by    /u/FoxResponsible4790  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Went to get a massage here in Hanoi. Massage was 300k and after the massage I assumed 50k would be enough for a tip. But the masseuse refused and so I pulled out a 100k note and she took it and then pointed at the 50k to give to her as well. I don't speak any vietnamese so I just gave it to her as well. Was I ripped off? 50% tip is a little too much imo 😅 I just considered it foreigner tax and won't be going back to that place lol\n Edit: This thread has been polarizing. And for the record it was just a normal 90 minute massage. No extras. And if I'm being honest the massage was not good either. The lady was inconsistent on where to apply pressure and did not do so equally on both sides and just massaged wherever. The place was nice and situated in a somewhat affluent neighborhood so I expected something better.\n    submitted by    /u/vlbonite  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems all this series were published in Vietnam at least two decades ago but not any longer. I guess Mangas are the big thing now.\n A couple of years ago (2017?) in HCMC i stumbled across a street (can't remember which district) with shop on shop where old magazines were pieled up in front. I found a lot of stuff but it was just the first week of our trip and my wife would've killed me if we had to carry a ton of comics for a month...\n Are there any of these shops in Hanoi. I've been to Đinh Lễ Street and Nhà sách Mão already (these pop up when you google). But all i got was one new Tintin at Trang Tien bookstore. A lot of shops i found on Google Maps which seemed very promissing are actually closed (Covid i guess).\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/cmd_rikers_brother  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because they no longer have their citizenship papers, and it takes a long time to get them again, they cannot put the properties in their names. What sort of options do they have?\n I was wondering if there was a kind of trust they could use to own the property, but have the trust be controlled by them, or, at the very least, have it be controlled by a relative still in Vietnam, but with their name attached in some way that requires their consent for anything to be done to the property. They are old and probably too trusting, I want to see if there is any way we can help protect their interests as well as possible.

Mình đang ở canada theo diện work permit nên sẽ có 3 năm để làm việc và cũng như cơ hội để kiếm thẻ xanh ở đây. Nhưng mà hiện tại thì em cảm thấy rất muốn về VN để sinh sống và làm việc cũng như được ở gần gia đình và bạn bè hơn. Nên mình dự tính là vẫn sẽ ở canada làm việc 2-3 năm để có thêm kinh nghiệm (và bằng CPA ). Mình chỉ đang thắc mắc là nếu trường hợp mình như vậy thì về vn có ổn không ạ? Và vấn đề lương thì mọi người thấy như thế nào? Mình thật sự rất cần lời khuyên ngay lúc này vì mình cảm thấy rất nhớ Việt Nam. Nếu quyết định về VN thì mình nghĩ lương sẽ không thể nào bằng được như ở CA được, nhưng mình nghĩ mình sẽ thoải mái hơn vì được gần gia đình và bạn bè và cũng như được ăn những món mình thích hoặc buồn thì cứ xách xe lên mà đi 1 vòng thôi. Nhưng nếu lương không ổn thì cũng hơi stress 1 tí. \n Cho mình cảm ơn mọi người nhiều.\n Hi everyone. I have just graduated from the university majoring in accounting and currently working as an accountant in Big4. I am in Canada on a work permit so I will have 3 years to work as well as the opportunity to apply for a green card. But now, I really feel like going back to Vietnam to live and work so I can be closer to my family and friends. I’m planning to stay in Canada to work for 2-3 years to gain more experience (and getting CPA). Is ok to go back to Vietnam after that? And what about the salary expectation? I really need some advices right now because I miss Vietnam so much. If I do decide to return to Vietnam, I don't think the salary will be as good as compared to CA, but I think I will be happier since I can be closer family and friends .\n Thank you and I really appreciate any advices/ suggestions/ inputs.\n    submitted by    /u/According-Growth3654  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm currently in Southeast Asia and will be arriving in Vietnam in late April. I originally planned to do the motorbike loop in Ha Giang independently on rented bikes, but that was before I learned about needing a motorcycle license. I don't want to risk my insurance being void, so that's out of the question now. \n I was pretty set on doing it independently without a company, so this threw a real wrench in my plan. I've already decided to skip travelling to Northern Thailand because of burning season, so I know I'll be back to the area, so my question is whether I should wait until I have a motorcycle license and do it later in life, or just suck it up and do it with an easy rider. \n The reason I'm posting is just to hear how it went for other people. I don't love not being in control of my own bike, I'm somewhat introverted so the social aspect isn't huge, I like being able to stop and check out little shops or side roads, and I'm concerned with a bigger group that I won't be able to do this. I don't really have the money to do a private tour, and even doing it with an easy rider is putting a bit of a stretch on my budget. \n Overall though, I'm wondering if I should still just do it. I suppose I'm just looking for stories of how people felt using easy riders and whether they felt like they would have had a better time doing it solo. The loop was the one thing I wanted to do the most out of Southeast Asia, but I'm wondering if I should just do it later when I can fully enjoy it. \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/makeshiftswift  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! Looking for some advice - let me know if this isn’t the right place. Friend and I are planning to ride 110cc bikes from north to south, weaving from mountains to coast in April/May. \n We are fully licensed to ride motorcycles in the US and have been riding for years. Fully understand that riding there is different and we take that seriously. Would be wearing protective gear and staying off the roads that don’t allow bikes. The US IDP provided by AAA lists Vietnam as “not party to the 1949 convention but honors IDP”. This is a little confusing as Vietnam did sign the Geneva convention in 1953. So while we aren’t terribly worried about being allowed to do this, we are having trouble finding medical insurance coverage since there doesn’t appear to be any laws that explicitly say US citizens can rent or drive any type or vehicle there. We’ve read about certain companies that would provide medical coverage anyway as long as you are licensed and qualified in your home country but haven’t found one yet.\n Is anyone aware of a way we can do this? Or any companies that expats or travelers have used successfully recently? I’m not willing to ride without medical coverage so I would need to travel by other means or go somewhere else. This is a trip I’ve been thinking of doing for years - I’d be extremely bummed to have to see this beautiful country out a train window and not be able to experience the smaller mountain communities along the journey (I’d also need to do the trip alone in this case). Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/dvt37283  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Spent 9 days traveling in Vietnam. Started from Hoi An and kept moving to Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, and ended at Ho Chi Minh. Used different modes of transport, met tons of people, and experienced things that I'm truly grateful for.\n My experiences helped me break a lot of stereotypes and prejudices that were told to me before my visit. Vietnam is not a country for cheap shopping or fake stuff or weird food. it's not a country where people will con you or misguide you. It's not a country that is rude, indifferent, or selfish.\n After 9 days in Vietnam, I'm taking back memories of meeting kind locals who go out of their way to help you, friendly shopkeepers who give you a small sovenieur as good luck because you made them smile while bargaining, helpful grab drivers who gave you a genuine smile just because you bowed and offered with money with both hands, Bar tenders and staff, who booked grab for me and offered a free drink just because i was nice to them. At every situation I got stuck or lost, I was given direction by locals who didn't have to give a fuck about me. After traveling many places in the world, I sincerely believe that if tourists remove their stereotypical blindfolds, they can experience a truly beautiful country I.e. Vietnam. ❤️ And that's what I'm taking back to India with me.\n P.S: I would like to offer my hospitality if anyone is planning to travel to India, especially Mumbai. Over and out.\n    submitted by    /u/666vulkan666  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know it’s hopeless, but maybe someone here has some advice lol\n My grandmother’s grandmother is from Huế, my grandmother’s family is from Tra Vinh, where we went to a family graveyard when we went to Vietnam for the first time this summer. We were able to come there since our family still has contact with Hmong people (?) that used to work for the family who own it now. It had the graves of many family members except one, my grandmother’s grandmother: Nguyễn Thị Điệm (born ca. 1880). Although there was a picture of her with her date of death: 20 Aug 1916. My grandmother told me that she was buried in Huế with her family, and that her brother who now lives in the US visited the grave in 2000 via contact with the gravekeepers, although she has not had contact with him for a long time, and does not seem very keen on doing it either. Apparently her brother (my greatuncle) is also not that bright due to his years in the camp.\n The family was apparently very rich, and were according to my family close to the emperor, I know nothing else except that Nguyễn Thị Điệm’s brother was a very prestigious or conceited photographer.\n I know its probably hopeless, but does anyone maybe have any advice on how i should find (how to contact) the graveyard (owners)?

          "description": "I am Vietnamese girl dating an expat for the 1st time, plz give me some advices. I live in Hanoi, he lives in HCM so this is the first time dating. He asks me to show him around when we meet in Hanoi. I was kinda passive in the relationships with other Vietnamese boyfriends before, like they picked me up to dating locations. Thus, I don’t know how to take the lead in dating with an expat in Hanoi. Which type of transportation used when we date? I don’t have car driving license. Pick him up by a motorbike I drive is bit weird, isn’t it? Have you been in this situation? Plz share your experience. Kindly introduce me some places that expats want to hangout in Hanoi. We are both in twenties. Much appreciated!\n Edit: Thank so much for your advice. Most of them are very helpful. I am way too overthinking. I was worried about the size difference if I drive him on a bike, im like 5’1 feet while he is 6’2 feet. But, I will ask him what he wants to choose bike or cab although bike is the my most preferred transport when hanging out in Hanoi. To whom who may wish me luck with green card: he is not even a Western. He is my Hindu colleague. We hit it off and accept a long distance relationship. That’s it. Now Vietnamese girls don’t date expats for money. We can be both cute and rich at the same time. Get used to it.\n    submitted by    /u/Ab6_Idk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would love to hear some examples of what you would typically choose as a wedding gift.\n Also - Other foreign friends who are going have said they are just going to give the couple money, is this normal/acceptable in Vietnam?

I value a good friendship, and nice communication / talk, even if nothings happens afterwards.

          "description": "Two years ago I was constantly seeing stories about how Vietnam had the highest economic growth in Southeast Asia. Was getting massively invested in by Japan and Korea, and had tons of companies relocating to it from China during the Sino-American trade war. Many YouTubers I was watch on the ground said they could see the explosive growth year by year as it felt like the early days of China as it was beginning to achieve great economic success. The everyday life was becoming tangibly better year by year.\n But I checked in again recently, and I saw the GDP growth has massively faltered the past two years, and also saw that the previous economics minded president has seemingly been replaced by a more politics minded one.\n So I was just wondering, does Vietnam still seem to be on track for explosive growth and this is just a short break because of COVID or is the growth really slowing down? Is life still improving year by year in Vietnam to a noticable degree?\n    submitted by    /u/Xefjord  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I look the price up its 5M Dong a night. 5M Dong. \n How do these luxury hotels even survive? Why they don’t lower the price?\n It seems like the hotel owners are so crazy rich they don’t care about some losses and don’t want to lower the prices to not lose image or something. (imagine you pay $200 for a hotel and some months later it’s $100 a night because of low demand. in Europe or also in Thailand, hotels dgaf and just lower the price to get at least some customers, but here it’s not like that). Or?? I can’t understand it pls explain me guys\n Also this Vin Grand World has sooo many restaurants and stuff with expensive food, but most of them are completely empty because it’s too expensive when you could get outside the same food for much lower price. \n It seems like the “market” with demand offer etc doesn’t really work for these giants they just dgaf about losses, or is there some bigger story behind that? I also remember how people in this sub once talked how expensive vinfast cars became or smth like that\n    submitted by    /u/pizzavegano  \n [link]   [comments]",

Keep in mind, as a guy driving a motorbike, I’m already in the habit of riding on the very edge of the road, but in the interest of safety, I’ve had to go off the road so many times because some impatient cargo truck driver can’t stand to behind another car so they invade a lane of oncoming traffic whenever they feel like it.\n Back to the horn problem…it has caused numerous deaths. It’s so loud that it had caused people to be startled to the point of falling off their motorbike and getting hit by the semi trucks or getting into deadly accidents with other vehicles from loss of control. It happens too much, and although there is technically a law against it but the penalty (like 2-3tr vnđ) is so light compared to the damage it causes.\n    submitted by    /u/Known-Invite-4717  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, does anyone have experience with marrying a man from VN as a foreigner?\n I'm not really a foreigner either, I'm a VK but don't speak vietnamese at all, but I do speak a chinese dialect and was able to get around a little in VN when I was there for 1 month. During that time, I met someone that is too perfect. We aren't dating, just friends, we met accidently. His family runs a little food shop/stand and I couldn't speak Vietnamese so he stepped in to help and we just started talking since I was there during slow business time.\n Prior to that I also thought about moving to VN to stay closer to family. I also like VN but I feel like I am romanticizing it too much and the reason I like it is because I can escape from my problems (work burnout).\n ​\n I don't really know what I really want to ask. I just want to hear from people about their experience. Since men and women in VN can be different in a relationship because of culture. I don't want to start a relationship and get his hopes up since he is older than me with aging parents.\n    submitted by    /u/throw_temp  \n [link]   [comments]",

In a panic, i agreed and he did some stuff and got me the test, but the gate was closed. So basically i had to buy a flight ticket to Osaka for a little bit later ($455) because i was told i couldn’t get any refund or transfer for the ticket i had + my visa for Vietnam was over today. I then had to pay the guy 4 mil for the pcr and sprinted to make my flight. In addition, new flight from Osaka Just ran into another guy in Osaka who was at the airport and he said the fake pcr was not only 150 but i could have just paid 1 mil to have my ticket changed until i could get a real pcr test for cheap. I feel like an idiot although i know i was just panicked and wanted nothing more than to make it to Tokyo so I’m out $700 extra dollars.\n    submitted by    /u/Feisty-Mongoose-5146  \n [link]   [comments]",

After posting this incidents in some FB groups, people shared their similar experiences so it happens quite a lot. I have never thought someone dares to steal in this area where there are so many security cameras\n Summary: - Before going through security screening, I took off my watch, put it in my purse. My purse didn't have zipper or lock. Put my purse lying down next to my husband's bag, in the same tray. (XRAY MACHINE IMAGE confirmed there was watch in my purse) - My husband push the bag tray in Xray machine then went through body scan. Then another man jumped in while I was taking off my shoes. I let him since I didn't want to delay other people - I went through body scan after pushing the shoe tray in Xray - Right after that, I got my purse back from my husband at the conveyor belt. I STOOD RIGHT THERE AND SEARCHED FOR THE WATCH, it was gone. I walked a little further (about 10 steps) to avoid blocking the way and took all stuff out of my purse to search for it. Nothing - 1 minute later (YES WE HAVE CAMERA FOOTAGE), my husband went back to the conveyor belt area to check all the trays around. Found nothing - I reported the issue to the airport security team. No official report, no help from them. Later I had to fly back to Phu Quoc to make a scene and got official report and watched camera footage and Xray machine images.\n    submitted by    /u/txm7826  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are doing well and employing around 75 people, including native engineers and many skilled factory workers. \n After this month of brutal internet, the series B round funders have issued an ultimatum for them to move design out of vietnam immediately. This was very embarrassing after a month of video call after video call was dropped; we were having a terrible time accessing code repositories hosted out of country, and a bunch of other problems due to new products relying on cloud connectivity. \n the investors are foreign, frankly they have little faith in whats going on here. They seem to believe its not just a coincidence of all the internet cables but one breaking down; but rather a systematic problem, either in infrastructure, or govt mismanagement. They visited earlier this month, met with city officials in ho chi minh, and were appalled at the attitude, as well as conditions around the city, and believe growth in a high tech field will only be impeded by being here. \n Frankly i cant argue. I love what we are working on and hate to have to turn away from this myself, but while they can work hard and compete, they will always be be hamstrung by access to real talent, and the 2nd world infrastructure. There is a culture of inefficiency in vn thinking that fester these kinds of problems. But founder is a rare brilliant vietnamese engineer who came home to make something good here, and looks like they wont be able to stay. \n Come on vn, get your shit together.\n    submitted by    /u/axa88  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello r/vietnam,\n We are four friends who are planning a trip to Southeast Asia between December 2023 and January 2024. As we begin to plan our itinerary, we are hoping to find a relaxing spot where we can unwind and swim towards the end of our trip.\n We've heard so much about the natural beauty of your countries and we would love to experience it firsthand. As described in the post on r/laos linked below, we would like to do a wild experience in the first weeks. We are hoping to find a beach or lake where we can enjoy some peace and quiet at the end of our travel. We are also hoping to find a spot with some amenities nearby, like restaurants or shops, but we don't want anything too crowded or touristy.\n We would really appreciate any recommendations you might have for a relaxing spot where we can swim and unwind during our trip. We are open to any and all suggestions, so please feel free to share your favorite spots and hidden gems with us.\n Thank you in advance for your help!\n Link to r/laos post: https://www.reddit.com/r/laos/comments/11807ya/calling_all_adventurers_seeking_local_tips_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n    submitted by    /u/icanfixyourprinter  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is one restroom stop on this route. We left on time and arrived on schedule. \n First of all the staff are excellent. Friendly and helpful check in agent and driver. \n Have no issue whatsoever with the customer service. For that this vendor earns three stars. \n Areas of improvement:\n VIP bus was messy. Had water bottles and trash from previous guests. Mini van was a little worn. Not as pristine as the photos but not terrible either. \n Where Cuc Tung looses stars is the driving experience. It was terrifying. The driver took unnecessary risks. There was low visibility due to fog and rain. Other travelers pulled off unto the side of the road but our driver's speed barely slowed down around the twists and turns of the mountain two lane highway And, he regularly passed cars while in blind curves. It was three a* clenching hours I was thankful to have survived. \n Safety should be a higher priority than timeliness.\n    submitted by    /u/Wild_About  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reading about Seoul’s fucked-up housing situation kind of freaks me out so I’m kind of curious about what’s happening in HCMC. \n My aunt “recently” sold their childhood house in D3 of HCMC for ~$500K USD. This is just what I overheard so I could honestly be mistaken, but this seems like a crazy amount for someone in VN to purchase considering the average annual salary of someone in HCMC. The only thing that stands out about this house to me is that it’s unlike the standard tall, narrow row houses with 4+ floors and had two floors, was much “wider” than it was tall, and had a backyard. It was a little out of place relative to the other structures around it. \n Is this “standard” pricing throughout most of HCMC? Sorry, I know this is a particularly stupid question since HCMC is massive. \n Do most people in HCMC “dream” about purchasing single family residences or has the goal shifted to purchasing a nice condo? Another family member told me that you can reasonably expect a newer condo to go for about ~$80K USD which still seems disproportionately high for the average salary, but I don’t know. \n Who is still able to purchase a “house” or a “condo”? \n Would you say the majority of people in HCMC today were born and raised there or moved there in the last 20 or so years?\n    submitted by    /u/lostnowlostlater  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is clear that Vietnam is a unified whole, there is no \"southern Vietnam\" and there is no \"northern Vietnam\". The Americans invaded Vietnam and the northern Vietnamese had the silent support of the people of South Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam was able to kick the American troops out of Vietnam.\n The Vietnamese people were in the old regime, injected with money by the US and spent it personally and without control. When the US withdrew, they lost funding, their living standards were reduced, so they were not used to it and tried to blame the communists. If the US wins, then Vietnam is now divided into two poles and will always be tense like \"North Korea and South Korea\" - obviously of the same origin but separated.\n    submitted by    /u/KookyEnthusiasm92  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also most videos I watch are mainly based in these districts as well. \n I want somewhere that’s not extremely touristy/‘expat-y’ (like Thao Dien and most of D1), but also has plenty of stuff to do and places to eat/drink, and not too far from touristy areas I can visit if I wanted (such as Nguyen hue). I originally planned to live in D3 as it seemed to fit these criteria.\n I realise BL isn’t actually that far from these areas, but I’m guessing with traffic and other factors, it would make the daily commute quite long and tedious. \n I’d also want somewhere with decent accommodation options for around 8tr. \n Thanks in advance for the help!\n    submitted by    /u/ijintheuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've just received an ESL teaching offer from a well-known company in Vietnam. I would appreciate some advice on one of the terms in the contract, as follows:\n \"In addition, by law, [company name] must be able to show at such an audit as referenced in the Decree No. 03/2014/ND-CP Article 8, full and complete details of all employees who are working at [company name] […] Only original documents (they will state 'This is notarised as an original' or similar) will be returned to you at the time of your leaving [company name]. Any notarised copies will be returned after not more than 3 months.\"\n So, I am planning to notarise and legalise copies of my degree and CELTA certificates, and give these to the company so they can process my work permit. I don't want to spoil my originals with stamps, and I'd be reluctant to hand over my originals in any case.\n I'm from the UK, and the process for notarising and legalising copies for use in Vietnam is very time-consuming and expensive. I'm unclear why the company would need to keep these officially notarised and legalised copies rather than a digital scan or physical copy of these, if it's just for audit purposes (a copy of a copy if you like). I'm concerned that it might be a ploy to stop me obtaining a separate work permit in the event that I wanted to work for another company (after the 3 month period stipulated).\n Is this standard practice, or should I be concerned?

I am on a very strict /r/carnivore diet due to an autoimmune condition, and I mostly eat only beef, butter and eggs. Occasionally seafood.

It's pretty cold here so I'm planning a 10-12 days work holiday trip to Vietnam soon, end of February beginning of march probably, looking for some spring like weather.\n I've read a couple of posts where people tend to lean Hanoi rather than Ho Chi Minh as a tourist destination but I am not sure. I would be fine with either. I understand Hanoi si less vibrant, more traditional, which is ok. I'm not looking for nightlife as I will be working. I don't want to exclude Ho Chi Minh though.\n It would be my first visit to Vietnam and I'm pretty excited. My concern is the weather, as I read that Hanoi tends to be colder? I'm leaving Japan for that reason, so I don't want to find myself in the same situation.\n Also, I would like to work with my laptop around the city and enjoy the famous Vietnamese coffee culture. Is it safe? I'm used to Japan where pickpocketing is not a thing and I read some posts here pointing out that snatching phones is rather common. Is that true? I would be screwed without my computer.

If there was civil unrest that threatened the Laos government, what would happen if China sent troops in under the guise of supporting the government or protecting their investments.? Given Laos has be a defacto puppet of Vietnam for much of it's existence and and there's always been rumours of VN troops supporting the government even in recent times against the Hmong and in the past against Thailand, would there be a response? I think it's fair to say that Vietnam at least considers Laos a part of it's sphere of influence, and while China would presumably prefer to continue to buy influence as they're currently doing in Laos and Cambodia, civil unrest could change things.

I just read that Vietnam dose not recognize the international drivers license I can get issued here in the US. \n We were hoping to rent a motor scooter like we did in Thailand when we visited.\n How would I go about driving legally?\n If there is no way to get a legal driving permit for my trip how big of a trouble would I get in if I got pulled over while driving?\n In Thailand my international permit was valid, but I saw others get pulled over and asked to pay a 300bhat \"fine\" to be on their way.\n Please any advice is welcome, I really want to obey the law and do things right. But my wife and I like to explore and hike and get off the beaten path if you will and not being able to drive ourselves around could get costly and put a real damper on our trip.\n Thanks in advance for your time and help.
