          "description": "I haven't had the opportunity to visit Vietnam since I was 6 years old. About 5 years ago my parents divorced and my dad figured it was time to go back to Nha Trang. Last week I received news that he had fallen incredibly ill so I booked a last minute trip to Vietnam to visit him for about 3 weeks. Although this isn't exactly a vacation as I plan on helping to care for my dad, I'm sure there will still be plenty of opportunities to go exploring and get back in touch with my Vietnamese heritage.\n Given that I haven't gone by since I was 6 and that I'm from California, I really have no idea how to prepare. What should I bring? What should I be cautious about? What are some dos and don'ts? I'm a pretty open-minded eater and literally wish to try all the things. Any recommendations?\n Other things about me:\n My Vietnamese is decent, I understand the southern accent very well and can get by in terms of speaking, but things get a little rough if the other person has a northern accent. If the other person has a central accent, no way lol. Unfortunately I can't read Vietnamese either.\n I'm terrible at dealing with the heat but can manage if I have to.\n I'm not taking days off work and plan to work (I'm a software engineer director) as well. How's the coffee shop scene over in Nha Trang?\n Any recommendations on what I must do over there on this last minute unplanned trip would also be appreciated!\n Edit: Spelling\n    submitted by    /u/solidiquis1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to show the people here that I’m not a foreigner who only speaks English.\n Here’s the thing - I’m doing job interviews at the moment trying to get a job, but have limited money at the moment. I did a trial lesson at a centre, and after the lesson they asked if I wanted to pay for my tuition fees then and there. The fees were 19.6 for 80 hours (I believe?) but I told them I don’t have the money for it currently due to finding work and not employed. I really want to start learning as soon as possible, but really struggle with apps such as Duolingo and resources like YouTube. I can’t learn anything from there - I get super distracted because of my ADHD and prefer in-class.\n Do you have any suggestions, or should I just wait until I start getting a salary and have more money? It’s making me a little sad that I only speak English and want to learn the language because I feel like I’m experience 1/50th of the life here…\n    submitted by    /u/sabethrowaway  \n [link]   [comments]",

She went to Vietnam in the beginning of May to visit her family after graduating and starting her job in August. She figured while she was there she would renew her passport (Expired in June of 2023). Unknown to us that there’s a shortage issue with the newer ID there and she can only renew her passport using that newer ID. It’s been a month and a half, there’s no sign of her getting the ID. Is there something she can do so that she can return back to the U.S. more urgently? Or rather what’s the average wait time for the ID to get processed, printed, and shipped? For future planning. \n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Web_Impressive  \n [link]   [comments]",

From step 2 shipment details, it doesnt proceed to step 3 select payment. So I might just check and buy it in the actual Samsung Store. Is it true that you cannot buy in the Bitexco branch? The other nearest to my hotel is the 134 Nguyen Thai Hoc St. branch. Anyway, can anyone check the latest price of Samsung S23+ in HCM? I just wanted to check if it's the same as the one in store. Also, if this is the wrong sub to post this inquiry, please help me identify the correct one.\n Since I'm already here, any tips on my upcoming trip? Previously went to Hanoi already.

          "description": "I live a great life in the U.S. but as I am sitting at work, I still think about moving back to Vietnam or how to do so in the future. This obsession has been going on for years now.\n I'm aware of all the pros and cons, it's just that I have this strange yearning to be there. My mom passed away last year and her family is still in Vietnam. We are very close and I want to live near her family before they all pass away as well. They are one connection I have left with her.\n The main issue is that I won't be able to get more than 3-4 weeks vacation off each year from work, and tickets will cost around 8k now. The flight is so long too just for a trip where we'll be spending at least one week with jetlag and stomach issues. Plus, my wife wants to go on vacations/beaches while I just want to near Quan 7 with the relatives.\n I've thought about moving to Orange County or Houston to ease this feeling, but those Vietnamese cities just don't feel the same. \n I know the future is far brighter in 15 years for the family if I stay in the U.S., I just feel sad each day working. I spend hours thinking about having enough money to live in Vietnam without worrying about the future.\n It's not rose-tinted glasses either, I worked remotely and had lived in Vietnam for 6 months recently with my wife/child. It was great. I know education and healthcare might be a problem later on. Waking up early for coffee and breakfast while watching the crazy traffic, going out to eat seafood/hot pot at night - that just can't be beaten.\n I suppose I'm just ranting and being too greedy. I can always get a significant pay cut/career limitation and get a remote job to live in Vietnam. It's just that I want what's best for my family/kid's future as well.\n Does anyone(especially the Viet Kieus) feel the same way?\n    submitted by    /u/baoluvboa  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now that we’ve been home in the states for 2 weeks she just got a call from a number her caller ID says was the Vietnamese Embassy. They claimed that someone was using her name/info in Vietnam to scam people and that she needed to work with the police in Vietnam to clear her name. They transferred her to a police station in Vietnam and the police officer used Viber to video talk with my wife in full uniform. She declined when he started asking for passport information. He said if she does not trust it she can investigate herself or find another way to have it investigated. Has anyone got a call like this before?

Everything from the food to the people are top notch. I don't know whether it's because I come from a country where women who drink and smoke and walk the streets late at night are perennially unsafe, but being here is simply so liberating. I haven't travelled the world much, but I've been to the Middle East, Singapore, and Germany, and none of them compare. Being here is a cultural shock in a good way.\n I know this post is vague, but I just wanted to say thank you so much wherever I could and to whomever I could, hence me doing so here.

          "description": "I live in Vietnam. I went back home and when I came back to Vietnam I brought some souvenirs and gifts. Nothing special. I was brought up \"minimalist\". I never bought fancy gifts for my partners, friends, and family. So, why would I do that to people who are, well, at the periphery of my friendzone?\n And all in all: Isn't it the thought that counts?\n Anyhow, my gifts received some harsh comments. For instance, a Vietnamese friend got some brand clothes from Europe. I bought some toys for his younger brother. Do you know Playmobil? A bit like Lego. I confess, the two toys (a Wild-west Fort and a Pirate ship) were on discount. But they cost about 100$. That is more than I gave to my bf for Christmas, LOL. Anyhow, I can survive that a 10yo doesn't say thankyou and is happy. But my friend said, that his brother was disappointed because he wanted some more \"valuable\".\n I am not on a paylevel which enables me to throw around with MacBooks and Iphones. I do not have such devices neither.\n Another time I was invited and I bought a 25$ red wine bottle. In my home country Germany that would already be too much. Most guests will spend about 10-15$. No one really awaits a 1,000$-bottle of Rothschild stuff.\n Anyhow, the host was quite rude. During the evening he showed my bottle, made a gesture like vomitting and put it aside. Then he presented a fancy Whiskey bottle and told everyone that the bottle was about 200$. This person was not even close to me, so why would I pay 200$ for some alcohol? I am in general a generous guy, but these two examples (there are quite more in my experience) are really too much. I understand, I am the \"rich\" foreigner. But they cannot really await that I come of dozens of Iphones, cars, laptops? I feel really sad, since my personal life is not circling around consumption.\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_Kha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nguyên nhân khiến mình áp lực và thất vọng có lẽ là vì mình đã làm \"vua chột trong xứ mù quá lâu\" và được bạn bè, thầy cô, cha mẹ cho là giỏi suốt những năm đi học mãi tới sau này mình mới nhận ra điều này, Mình mới dùng reddit vì cũng chả biết chia sẻ với ai nữa.

Told me he has family in Australia and telling me all about them. Asked if I'd like to get a drink with him, which I was happy to do!\n Spent some time drinking with him, during which time he told me his family were visiting and they were having a big party. When it was time to go, he asked if I'd buy a bottle of wine for their party, which I agreed to do. He took me about a 10min ride away to a shop to buy wine, which cost 900,000 dong and then took me back to where we met. I realised at the time the wine was very expensive but I was a little drunk and didn't know where I was exactly so I didn't protest. I assume he just takes the wine back and splits the profits with the shop! \n While we were drinking he took my email, I assume he'll try and have me send money for something else, but should I watch out for anything else? \n Thanks for any advice!\n    submitted by    /u/bonjarden  \n [link]   [comments]",

This individual post fake animal rescue videos. If you’re unfamiliar with this, the “rescuer” puts an animal in danger,harms, or injures the animal and then proceeds to record them being rescued for views and donations. \n Their accounts are BA Animals Care Media and BAC. Both post the same content and are owned by the same person. Please do not view their videos as it will gain popularity that way. Instead report it to YouTube. \n My questions are, are there any animal rights in Vietnam? Does authority take animal cruelty seriously? \n I’ve reached out to a few rescue groups in Vietnam I found on google. I’m hoping they could help.

(Contact info below) Just finished my food tour with her and she’s the sweetest kindest human and she took us to 8 different places and it was amazing. Holes in the wall you wouldn’t consider. Down alleyways up three flights of stairs to hidden spots. We have dietary restrictions (my husband doesn’t eat pork, which is tough here because 90% of food in Vietnam is based around pork and I’m mostly vegetarian) and she was able to accommodate us and still make the tour authentic and true to Hanoian culture and food. Her English was great and she was easy to talk to and get along with. She really deserves the shout out and recognition. We looked around for food tours and I saw someone mention her on here and I found her via Airbnb.

          "description": "I think for the most part, people in Vietnam are quite laidback and friendly. Why does it change so much when people are driving? A large number of people just turn into selfish assholes as soon as they're in control of a vehicle. Car drivers seem to consider the possibility of slowing down or giving way an insult to their ego. Bike drivers pay little attention to any kind of rules unless they're being watched by police. They'll drive the wrong way, break red lights, use sidewalks, pay zero attention to other traffic and refuse to stop at junctions. Buses and trucks only seem to have an accelerator and a horn. Everybody seems to be in a massive rush to get somewhere, yet when they arrive they just nonchalantly wander around like NPCs. \n What's actually going on? I'm aware it's not everyone and you see plenty of people patiently waiting in traffic while those around them mount the sidewalk, but the sheer number of people that act like assholes on the road is way higher than in other countries. I don't think it just infrastructure because it happens even when the infrastructure is good. I also see people blame lack of education or poor people from the countryside, but you can cross the border into Laos and it's totally different experience\n    submitted by    /u/AnJa1407  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I noticed that the tones of Tiếng Huế sound vastly different from the first two: dấu sắc is lower rather than higher and sounds more like dấu hỏi, and dấu huyền is higher instead of slightly lower, but not as high as a typical dấu sắc. A few days ago I asked a Chinese friend what the four tones in Chinese sounded like, and I realized that they sounded very similar to Tiếng Huế’s tones. Dấu huyền of Tiếng Huế sounds like the falling tone of Chinese and dấu sắc sounds like the rising tone. I can’t speak for whether dấu hỏi/ngã sounds like the down-up tone, as I do not know what hỏi/ngã sounds like in Tiếng Huế. Why do Tiếng Huế’s tones sound similar to the Chinese tones? I’m guessing because Huế was the old capital of Việt Nam, most likely where most of the nobles/elites resided. Being a noble probably meant you probably had be able to speak in Mandarin and write in Chữ Hán/Nom, which likely had an influence on how they spoke Vietnamese.

Is General De Lattre a much better general than Westmoreland was like OP claims in the link with his gigantic paragraph of details? I'm seeking a balanced view since the poster at Alternate History Forum is obviously super biased.\n I have heard of De Lattre prior to reading the article as one of the most famous French generals of the Second World.

          "description": "The news that Vietnam will have 70 Michelin Guide honored restaurants in 2023 is encouraging and long overdue. Vietnam's unique culinary traditions, blending multiple regional styles with influences from China and France, produce some of the world's most iconic and delicious dishes.\n From pho to banh mi, spring rolls to imperial court cuisine, Vietnamese food withstands comparison with the finest culinary traditions anywhere. The creativity, skill and passion of Vietnamese chefs across the country have produced cooking that has long deserved global renown.\n Having 70 Michelin-reviewed establishments will help showcase the diversity and quality of Vietnam's dynamic restaurant scene to an international audience. It will attract more food tourists, boosting the hospitality industry and local economies. Most importantly, it provides deserved recognition for the craftsmanship and dedicated hard work of Vietnamese chefs over generations.\n As a Vietnamese, I have long taken for granted the pleasures of Vietnam's cuisine. But global acknowledgement from prestigious groups like Michelin will be a source of pride for Vietnamese people everywhere. It demonstrates that our culture's softest power - our food - can compete on the world stage. I hope this is just the beginning and that more Vietnamese culinary masters will have their talents spotlighted in the years to come.\n Vietnamese restaurants have earned their place amongst the finest in the world. I hope the Michelin Guide and other international reviewers will help spread the word and introduce more people to the joys of Vietnamese gastronomy. Our chefs deserve this honor - now it's time for the world to feast their eyes and taste buds on what Vietnam has to offer.\n https://vietreader.com/travel/food/85667-70-michelin-honored-vietnamese-restaurants-and-eateries-in-2023-part-1.html\n    submitted by    /u/vinhta121290  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been using Zalo to communicate to my driver and team members when I'm back at my apartment / out of the office (I don't have Facebook, so this was a good alternative while out here).\n Unfortunately, I had to replace my phone last time and Zalo put me through some loops to basically \"re authenticate\" me by having someone already in my Zalo contacts confirm it's me. Naturally, that happened a few days before I flew back out here, so I was unable to get in touch with anyone when I landed (didn't realize this was needed until I landed). I eventually got hold of someone and they did the in-person verification.\n However, ever since then, the Zalo app keeps telling me I need to \"verify\" my account. It has an option to upload a photo of your passport but it doesn't seem to like an American passport. Do I need to verify? How do I do this? Anyone have experience making it work?\n I tried to chat with Zalo support but they only would message me in Vietnamese. I really only use this to keep in touch with my team, does verify even matter?\n    submitted by    /u/OldManKiK  \n [link]   [comments]",

The official word is that power cuts will be occuring daily due to \"El Nino\". \n Over the past week or so, my district (Long Bien) has experienced 5 outages that last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours at a time. We're told about them in the morning, so there isn't much time to plan around them as they start at 8 AM. \n Tonight, we've been told (officially) that the outages will occur each day for the next month. In my 9 years living in Hanoi, I've never experienced this before, yes, occasionally power will cut during a typhoon, but never like this. \n Does anyone else who is currently going through this have a backup generator? Is it worth investing in one? My wife and I run our business from home and we need to be online 24/7. We can't be out of the house for too long as we have 2 dogs that only pee outside and our son comes home for lunch and a nap each day. \n Need advice on how to deal with it. Can't move because we own our property. Should I buy a generator? Have you heard any information about the power cuts that might shed more light than our building's manager has already? Do you know someone who works in the energy sector that has mentioned it to you? Feeling absolutely helpess RN.\n    submitted by    /u/j3d321  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tôi cũng đã có một mối tình 7 năm với vợ mình từ những năm đầu khi còn học đại học, chúng tôi cưới nhau 2 năm rưỡi từ trước dịch covid19, và chưa có con.\n Mọi thứ cứ trôi qua êm đẹp như vậy, đi làm kiếm tiền như bao người. Cho đến khi vợ tôi nghỉ công tác tại ngân hàng M… Việc này làm tôi khá khủng hoảng về tinh thần khi làm ca kíp về và liên tục bị trì triết, phàn nàn về nhiều thứ. Và vợ tự sinh ra cái suy nghĩ nghỉ làm thành gánh nặng của tôi, mặc dù tôi cũng rất tán thành việc nghỉ nếu công việc quá áp lực và không hiệu quả về kinh tế. \n Tôi chả biết do nghiệp hay duyên làm tôi có quen được 1 chị tiếp viên hơn tôi 3 tuổi vào đúng thời gian này. Không ai chủ động, chỉ nói chuyện về công việc rồi chia sẻ về cuộc sống, dần rà sau 1 tháng điều gì đến sẽ đến. Vâng, tôi có cãi nhau với vợ và rủ chị kia đi Hạ Long chơi và có qhtd. Ban đầu mục đích của tôi chỉ là giải toả căng thẳng, bằng một cách thần cmn kỳ xong chị ta yêu tôi. Rồi ngày qua ngày, việc chị ta cứ chia sẻ công việc (cùng ngành) mua đồ, quan tâm đến tôi cũng làm tôi có chút rung động :)\n Thực sự việc này tôi đã biết là sai ngay từ lúc rủ chị ta đi Hạ Long, tôi cũng vẫn rất yêu vợ mình chứ. Nhưng bản tính tham lam và râm tục của tôi làm tôi vẫn muốn giữ mối quan hệ này :( Chị ta cũng biết tôi có vợ và vẫn chấp nhận làm người thứ 3… Sau khi chia sẻ những lời này thì tôi vẫn đang có một gia đình đáng yêu và vẫn duy trì mqh ngoài luồng. Tôi sai rồi!!\n    submitted by    /u/Able-Masterpiece5877  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My parents and the older generation of my family, those who immigrated to the US, have always said that American and Western foods are always too salty or too sweet. They always say that too much salt or sugar is used. They also say this is why American food is so unhealthy.\n I’ve mainly been raised up in the US and eat both Asian and Western cuisines but never found this to be true. I’ve always found most foods to be reasonably seasoned to my tastes. I’ve asked friends and family around my age, and they also generally agree with me. I also believe the whole “American food is unhealthy” myth to be untrue because that really only applies to fast food which you really don’t eat on a daily basis. It’s also a huge over generalization of American cuisine considering how diverse each region and state is. I digress though. Is it really true that Vietnamese/Asian cuisine use less salt/sugar and are healthier than American/Western cuisine, or is this more of a subjective to taste thing?\n    submitted by    /u/QuaintAlex126  \n [link]   [comments]",

Last year I spent a month travelling your beautiful country, but this time I’m spending 2 weeks in Saigon. \n I’m looking to see if there is any sort of Hip Hop scene in Saigon? Have it be gigs, shops, painters, dancers, rappers and singer, anything really. I’m a street artist here in Australia and found a bit of a scene last year in Hanoi, so surely there is something going in in Saigon. \n Also, looking to go and see some good live music, both traditional and if there is any contemporary gigs. I’ve found the opera which will be great to go to. But I’m open to anything really! Also if there is any race scene at all? I’ve found a few clubs that have potential like Arcan. \n Thanks in advanced everyone.

I just hate that they didn’t at least stay and experience the movie with me and my brother. It had been a while since we had gone out to the movie theaters as a family.\n To make it worse, my brother is very hot tempered and told them to shut up several times while they were critiquing the movie, and even as they were walking out. I get where his frustration is coming from, but I don’t agree with how disrespectful he was. \n They waited for us outside in the car.

Assuming guests can make it, what is recommended location for December wedding? \n  \nCost: Will the wedding cost similar at both locations? Assuming similar type of venue and decoration. \n \nWeather: preferably we want outdoor wedding. From our initial search, it may rain in DaNang in December? \n \nVenue availability in December: DaNang seem to be busy with tourists during December \n \n Main reason for considering DaNang/ Hoi An is half of the guests are non Vietnamese and these locations are unique to Vietnam. Since they are traveling to Vietnam, and may not travel again in future DaNang/ Hoi An has more cultural and tourist things todo. We might be wrong, but we don’t see something similar in or nearby Ho Chi Minh City. We would like your opinion/ suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/hopygopy  \n [link]   [comments]",

And people in some countries in Europe don't have AC at home, according to some of my friends in France, Spain and UK.\n Sales of portable air-conditioning units rose 2,420 percent in a week, British retailer Sainsbury’s said during the hot season last year. Some in Europe are coming to accept that some AC usage may be needed to save lives. After a heat wave killed an estimated 15,000 people in France in 2003, air conditioning was introduced to some nursing homes in a bid to protect the most vulnerable. \n How do you guys feel about AC in Vietnam, where the prices are cheap and almost every household in urban cities like Hanoi or Saigon has at least one.

          "description": "Hi Viet Nam!\n Over the last year or two, I've been coming across articles about how major smartphone manufacturers have been increasingly shifting operations towards India and Viet Nam.\n As you know, China has been pretty much the \"factory of the world\" over the last 2 decades and her socioeconomic transformation has been astounding over the same period to say the least. Sadly, I was too young to pay attention then.\n Because of a rapidly aging population and diminishing workforce, cost of labour in China has risen exponentially. Coupled with constant, multi-front geopolitical tensions, one can understand why having operations in China faces a diminishing risk-reward ratio.\n Looking at Vietnam's Balance of Trade, I see that it's surged post-2015, around the time the protectionist Trump administration got elected - which I suppose accelerated the trend of de-coupling from China. However, the Vietnamese Dong seems to be facing a constant weakening, unlike that of an export hub. Somehow, I never see reports about how these winds are affecting regular Vietnamese citizens.\n Have you noticed a surge in manufacturing activity in Viet Nam?\n If so, how has this impacted you? \n Has the surge been driven by MNCs setting up their own plants, or have they been subcontracting to local manufacturers?\n Also, have these factories been concentrated in particular regions and therefore limited in benefit?\n Do you think Viet Nam will experience the same breakneck growth in the next decade as China did?\n I'm excited to hear the perspectives of people living through the change!\n    submitted by    /u/polymathicus  \n [link]   [comments]",

But it's 01:50 AM and those motherfuckers are still singing and blasting EXTREMELY LOUD music. Nobody was able to sleep. Many tourists and visitors are staying near the beach, around the area. There are many hotels. Many have toddlers that need to sleep early. Many have tours that start as early as 7am-8am in the morning.\n Tried to call the police for the noise pollution and they're useless. \"Oops we can't do anything uwu\" 😑. Heard a similar situation happened in Nha Trang during Tet as well. Is this only in Nha Trang specifically or does it occurred in other cities in Vietnam as well? \n Update: The Khanh Hoa province posted this news today in the 31st of May, to remind everyone about the laws and rules.\n https://khanhhoa.gov.vn/vi/tin-tuc-noi-bat/phong-chong-vi-pham-phap-luat-trong-hoat-dong-van-hoa-the-thao-va-du-lich-3005\n Noise pollution is illegal in Vietnam and organisers have to follow the laws created by the Vietnam government.

Basically I’m always a foreign and I know “difficult” people are everywhere.. I’m in Vietnam at the moment and this is being a bit difficult. I always try to smile and Learn the language, at least to say “please” “thanks” “hello” “very good” etc. In HCMC starts with some yelling and pointing fingers and laughing. In Da Lat some being attended with angry looks. In Nha Trang at the bus counter they even don’t want to sell me the tickets for my next destination and turning the face like I wasn’t there… at the hotel, the manager, was asking me if I taken something from the “minibar” ( literally 4 Pepsi cans ) 4 time in a row aggressively and threatening with checking the room…. Should I assume that’s the treatment that I’ll have all around the country? Of course there where people that wanted to help, but at the moment seems they are the minority… and please don’t read this as pointing fingers or in any bad way. As I said I just want to understand.

I´m using the \"Assimil\" language course book for self study to learn Vietnamese. \n Yesterday tho, I watched a video about the usage of Vietnamese pronouns by Tieng Viet Oi, which is a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching Vietnamese, and they explained the use of the pronouns in a completely different way than my course book uses them!\n Now I feel insecure and I don´t know, if I should keep on using my course book, because I don´t want to learn this major part of the language in a wrong way! I don´t doubt, that the infos given by Tieng Viet Oi are wrong, because they´re native speakers, but maybe my book uses rules that they left out? I don´t know! Can you native speakers out there tell me, if this use of the pronouns makes any sense, or if my course book isn´t a good source?\n ​\n 1.Dialogue:\n Person1, Stranger: calls other cô / Person2, stranger: calls other ông - formal setting\n 2.Dialogue\n Person1, waiter: calls other bà / Person2, customer: calls other ông - restaurant order\n 3.Dialogue\n Person1, knows other person, not closest friends: calls other anh / Person2, same as other: calls other chi (dot under i) - colloquial talk\n ​\n --> also the book explains the pronouns as:\n -cô: young women or women who aren´t married\n -ông: men older than 40 years\n -bà: elderly women or married women\n -anh/chi(dot): people you know and that are around your age\n ​\n (it doesn´t really consider the relationship between the speaker and the other person!)\n ​\n I´m sorry for the long post! I´d really appreciate any adivce, because I fell in love with the Vietnamese language and I just want to keep on studying!

I have no Vietnamese/Asian heritage myself, if that’s relevant.\n I’d like to do a special mother-in-law/son-in-law dance at the western reception, but it’s hard to find a suitable song. I want to find a song in Vietnamese for a slow dance that is appropriate coming from a son-in-law. Many songs about mothers talk about the mother raising the singer, which isn’t genuine to our relationship. I’m hoping to find a song whose lyrics work coming from me.\n Do you know of any sweet, heartfelt songs in Vietnamese that are about a mother-in-law? Or about a mother, but without focusing on how the mother raised the singer? Or a song about an amazing, strong person without any romantic subtext?\n My fiancée’s cousin helped me find Mẹ Yêu by Đỗ Phú Quí, which sounds perfect, but reading a translation of the lyrics, seems to focus too much on how the mother raised the singer. But maybe the sentiment would still work?\n Thank you for helping me make the day special for my (soon-to-be) mother-in-law!\n    submitted by    /u/lol43  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My cousin and I are planning a trip to southeast Asia from mid-November thru early December. Most likely a November 14 departure and a December 3-4 return. We are both guys in our mid/late 20s from Los Angeles. We like nature (hiking + excursions), nature sightseeing, large cities, food, and partying.\n We were set on doing 2 weeks in Thailand but are now considering adding 4-5 days in Vietnam due to the recommendations of many family members & friends.\n Our initial plan was to do 3-5 days in Bangkok & Pattaya and then travel south for the remainder of the trip to see Phuket and Koh Phi Phi.\n So my main question is this: If we have 4-5 days, how would you recommend we spend it in Vietnam? Bangkok and Hanoi? Is it possible to truly experience these 2 major Vietnamese cities in that short of time? Should we omit one? Maybe reduce some of our time in Thailand?\n I understand there are dozens of great places we'll be missing... But I am hoping some seasoned travelers or residents of either country can give feedback/advice. It is MUCH appreciated!!\n    submitted by    /u/mike10345  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "According to Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Thanh Lam, Vietnam leads the world in cyber abuse to cheat and violate the law.\n At the Multi-Channel Management Networking Workshop on the morning of May 27 in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Nguyen Thanh Lam said:\n \"For every 100 dong earned from cheating on YouTube, there are 55 dong of Vietnamese users. We are at the top of the list for copyright infringement. There is a football livestream channel that violates copyright like Xoi Lac TV. There is a channel that buys Japanese porn, cuts it into many short clips, and then packs it and sells it to the American audience.\"\n Lam said the country in second place in the ranking accounts for only 5% of fraudulent income, one-tenth of Vietnam. Last week, Apple also announced to remove more than 8,000 infringing applications originating in Vietnam, many of which are content creation applications.\n The deputy minister said that this is a sad record, exposing the fact that besides positive content, many creators still do business and make money regardless. Part of the responsibility lies with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook when they can't control the content and users on the platform. Advertisers also have a responsibility to still spend money on dirty content.\n \"The state does not prevent businesses from wanting to advertise in cyberspace, but it is impossible for a money to flow into malicious content that businesses still see as normal,\" Mr. Lam said.\n https://vnexpress.net/100-dong-gian-lan-tren-youtube-55-dong-cua-nguoi-viet-4610452.html\n    submitted by    /u/quochuy2021  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please help me out!\n  \nIs Cat Ba Island worth it? We wanted to avoid the crowd in Ha Long Bay, but stay near the sea and relax. \n Any suggestions for Cat Ba, like places to eat/ things to do/ places to stay?\n Best way to travel from Hanoi to Cat Ba and back?\n For Hanoi, we have Egg Coffee, Bahn Mi (and a lot more food items) and Beer Street on our list already, but any hidden/hole in the wall places that are away from commercial tourism would be great to know. Very open to trying authentic vietnamese food and drinks!! \n Any suggestions for a reputable spa experience in Cat Ba or Hanoi are most welcome\n Any suggestions for where to go for a party in Hanoi?

So, in this spirit, I propose a new Vietnamese flag that symbolizes the indestructible friendship between the North and South; a new flag free of bad connotations; a flag that combines the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam. \n As we strive to foster stronger connections between Vietnamese wherever they may reside or what they believe, it is essential to have a symbol that represents our shared values of friendship and understanding; representing multiculturalism, love, diversity, respect and mutual understanding 🤝🌍\n https://preview.redd.it/002tzmjnop2b1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4fee59796edb5dd67668bdff04b4be0a250ccd22\n This proposed flag aims to honor Vietnam's rich cultural heritage and traditions (blue) and emphasizes the significance of unity and cooperation (red). The Golden Star represents the everlasting bond between Vietnam's people and their striving for greatness and prosperity for all Vietnamese people, regardless of their geographical location or political stances.\n With my loving heart, I invite every one of you to print this flag out, show it to your parents and especially grandparents and display it proudly in your windows. Let's propagate the message of love and friendship.

The flight is already booked so we have to start and end at hcmc no matter what. \n What do you recommend? Should I \n  \nTake it easy and stay entire week in HCMC and go for day trips to cu chi and mekong delta etc\n \nTravel to danang/hoi an via plane/train. Will it be too tiring to go there and back to hcmc in 7 days?\n \nSpend the time in South Vietnam, going furthest to muine/nha trang?\n \n Or anything in between? \n Also, are the roads super difficult to cross? I have huge anxiety about this and when I cross the road usually use traffic lights so I'm super unconfident.\n Also, I'm going in august.. read that it's the rainy season.

          "description": "In recent years, Vietnam has been making strides in the world of technology and innovation. With the rise of start-ups and the increasing number of high-tech companies moving their branch offices to Vietnam, is there a possibility that Vietnam, this Southeast Asian nation, could become the next start-up nation in Asia?\n The shift from China to Vietnam has been noticeable, with companies such as Samsung, LG, and Intel all establishing a strong presence in Vietnam. This trend is not limited to just large corporations, as start-ups are also finding success in Vietnam's growing tech scene.\n One reason for Vietnam's appeal is its young and highly educated population. According to the World Bank, nearly 60% of Vietnam's population is under the age of 35, and the country boasts a literacy rate of over 95%. This has created a strong talent pool for tech companies to draw from.\n Another factor contributing to Vietnam's potential as a start-up nation is its favorable business environment. The Vietnamese government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurship. The country has also made significant improvements in infrastructure, including expanding its internet connectivity and investing in new technology parks.\n However, there are still challenges that Vietnam must overcome in order to fully realize its potential as a start-up nation. One major hurdle is the lack of venture capital funding available for start-ups. While the government has taken steps to address this issue, more needs to be done in order to attract investment and support the growth of new businesses.\n Source & full text from https://www.micronews.site/2023/05/will-vietnam-become-next-start-up.html\n    submitted by    /u/very-creative  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would love to visit HCMC and do the hiang loop also.\n My concern is with the street dogs that I have seen online in the SEA countries especially in Thailand and I was wondering what the reality of the situation is in Vietnam.\n I am at the level where if I see a dog I will cross the road or go the other way.\n I’ve heard that pretending to pick up a rock and holding a stick / umbrella is good defence.\n Is it realistic for me to have a good time in Vietnam (especially if most my time will be on group tours and city) with the dog population?\n Mainly my fear is with dogs off lead and more so feral/wild/street dogs in packs.\n Thank you very much and apologies for the errors question, I know that dog phobia is not common and that most people love dogs - trust me I do too but I cannot lie about the reality that I fear dogs.\n    submitted by    /u/zkgkilla  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I've been thinking about visiting Saigon/ HCM City this July (would be my first time in Vietnam) but I'm kinda worried about the humidity, the heat and the rain. \n From what I've seen the weather seems to be more bearable than in Hanoi but I'm not quite sure in how far it would allow me to do sightseeing and stuff throughout the day.\n So I was wondering if someone could tell me about the personal experiences in Saigon around this time of year. Do tourists usually visit there in summer? Do public buildings, restaurants and trains have AC? Do locals spend time outside during the day or do they usually try to stay inside?\n Pretty much what I wanna know is if I'll be able to have a good time despite the warm weather and rain. I live in Europe and the climate here is quite different from SE Asia, so apologies if some of my questions come across as naive or uneducated. \n Either way, I know there's no definitive answer to this, but any helpful advice is much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/imakuni1995  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now my in laws speak next to zero english, and my family speak no Viet. \n I'm just wondering if anyone might have some suggestions for some good activities we could enjoy together without having to rely to heavily on my wife to translate constantly.

Wanted to share some things I saw for foreigners in terms of how to get into town with zero stress taking a grab.\n 1) Go through customs, Exit international terminal. Look for the green umbrella tents across the street. 100 yards max. cant miss them. 5-6 large green umbrellas. I dont ever remember seeing these before. \n 2) open grab and use the green umbrella area as your pick up spot.\n it should cost you 125k dong to get into D1. Grab will add 15k for the airport toll. Total bill should be about 140k + any surge. The driver pays the toll.\n Waiting for grab at 6am = 10 mins\n ride to D1 took 15-20 mins.\n Cost was 140k dong which is like 7 bux. and best was ZERO stress of being ripped. had 3-4 taxi guys approach and follow me to grab area.\n    submitted by    /u/trojanmana  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to preface this by saying I undestand that eating dog meat is a cultural practice and that it is not too different from pigs and chickens (I am vegan and not here to judge). However, I would like to know how visible this trade is when visiting and how I could avoid seeing it. For reference, I will be going from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi and will be visiting other places along the way like Hoi An, Hue, and Phong Nha. Any advice and experiences would be appreciated.

          "description": "Foodie friend asked me to help ask around...\n La Maison 1888 is the French fine dining restaurant of Intercontinental Hotel Da Nang. This hotel is a 30 minute car ride away from the main beach because it is on the far end of the coast, and it does not allow Grab pickups out of the hotel. The restaurant is built into an old villa on a cliff, overlooking the water, and is very beautiful. They emphasize that they have the only 3 Michelin star French chef working there, and claim to be the #1 food destination in Vietnam. (Tasting menu is VND4-5M.)\n The advertising feels scammy because there is no such thing as a Michelin star chef. They claim the chef helped design the menu and he runs a 3 Michelin star restaurant in Paris, which is not the same thing and he is not in the Da Nang restaurant. Vietnam will only get Michelin rated retaurants in 2023, and only in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. There are very few blog reviews about the restaurant, and their TripAdvisor and Google Maps reviews do not imply that this is a legendary must try before you die place.\n Can Vietnam foodies comment?\n Sample blog post: https://secretlifeoffatbacks.com/20...-sun-peninsula-resort-the-ultimate-in-luxury/\n    submitted by    /u/josemartinlopez  \n [link]   [comments]",
