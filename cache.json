          "description": "We are considering a month summer trip on the Vietnam SE coast. Potentially flying into Denang and spending a week in Hoi An and then maybe flying or night bus/train to Nha Trang and staying there for 3 weeks for relaxing beach time. \n I’ve read you can’t rent a car in Vietnam and we would not feel comfortable riding scooters with our kid (or even probably just an adult 🤣). \n The places I’m looking at to stay are not in the city center so we can have more space and a pool. We already live in a high rise in a big SE Asian city, so I’d prefer a villa experience while on vacation. \n My husband thinks having to use Grab multiple time a day if you want to grocery shop, eat out, visit a different beach will be a huge hassle and the cost will add up. This feels like a dealbreaker to him and he thinks we should scrap the Vietnam idea and go to a different country. :(. I read about hiring a car with driver for a few weeks. This sounds pretty weird to me and maybe awkward, but I figured I need to explore this option.\n How do you find a trusted driver like that?

I then asked a question about how my name appears on the e-visa (last,first, middle vs. last, middle,first) and got no response. It’s been a week since. I read the on the embassy website that visas done by third party may not be legit and can result in entrance refusal. Anyone has experience with this site or this kind of service?

I seem to understand that both these times are not ideal from a weather point of view.\n I have been researching quite a bit and if I got it right it looks like I am going to risk typhoons in the north in August; while December is quite cold in the north and very rainy in the central area of Hue and Hoi An.\n Unfortunately I cannot get around these two times of the year, so I was wondering if you have any suggestions. Maybe some of you have been in August or December and can let me know if it's really risky to the point of having the whole trip ruined by weather?\n I am somewhat tending towards December.

          "description": "Hello fellow Redditors,\n I am a 47-year-old Belgian man who has had the pleasure of visiting Vietnam 12 times, spending a total of 16 months there. Through my interactions with the South Vietnamese community where I live, as well as my multiple visits and online relationships, I have become fluent in speaking and writing in Vietnamese. In fact, when a native Vietnamese speaker hears me on the phone, they often mistake me for a Vietnamese person. In addition to my fluency in Vietnamese, I also speak French, Dutch and English, and have a basic understanding of German.\n My dream is to find a job in South Vietnam, but I am facing a bit of a hurdle. I have been working for the government since 1996 and therefore do not have any other qualifications beyond my high school diploma. Additionally, I have no concrete proof of the skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout my career. However, I am skilled in working with computers and have strong communication abilities. My current job involves designing templates that are sent to millions of citizens, but the software I use is not utilized by any companies in Vietnam.\n I am willing to accept a salary that is typical for Vietnam, as money is not a concern for me. My only qualifications are my high school diploma and my work experience, so my CV is essentially my career. I am open to any job, but I am unsure of the best course of action. Should I try to find a job while on a tourist visa and do visa runs until I secure employment? Or, should I enroll in a school in Ho Chi Minh City in order to obtain a student visa? I believe my English and Vietnamese language abilities are sufficient to pass any necessary tests, and I am eager to immerse myself in the educational experience.\n All I know is that I am happiest when I am in Vietnam, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to make my dream a reality. Thank you for reading and for your responses.\n    submitted by    /u/Environmental-Owl383  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short ever since then I've been feeling some type of way towards her (in a good way not a bad way).\n Growing up in Canada I've never really had the need to say new year wishes in Vietnamese to my other friends here but rather just my grandparents and parents. So I'm used to saying things like chúc mừng năm mới.. or con chúc ông bà nhiều xúc khỏe song lâu tram tuoi etc. \n So my question is are there any ideas on how I can send her new year wishes without just the plain chúc mừng năm mới? In other words what are some ways to send wishes from friend to friend. \n From the top of my head in the context of friend to friend, I can only think of wishing for good health, happiness and lots of money. \n Apologies if this question came out kind of odd or if i'm overthinking it.\n    submitted by    /u/danky_n  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a 41 Hue refugee that at 2 months old we escaped from VN to Hong Kong then Philippines then CA, US. I have never been back, and the plan was to visit in 2020 but covid hit. Now is the time. Super excited. Minus traveling days we should have 16 full days.\n Here are the places I wanted to visit: Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Long bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An.\n Originally we wanted to fly into Saigon then fly into Da Nang and make our way up north and fly home from Hanoi. However after watching vids on youtube and reading, wondering if we should just skip Saigon and spread say 2 days to the cities mentioned above. Is it worth visiting giving our amount of days in VN? I've heard people say they wouldn't have been sad if they skip it while others say it's a must visit. Also how many days of each cities is sufficient.\n Any suggestions would be helpful. thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Latter_Strawberry_78  \n [link]   [comments]",

His father was a locksmith. This is all I can gather from him as it is it is a very sensitive topic. We are heading back to Vietnam to search for his parents, or any members of his family, in Saigon and then making our way to Hanoi. I am hoping I can get a head start with some search tips online. It seems the best way to go searching for this would be to look at church records but unfortunately, I need help on the ground. Or any sort of obituary. He seemed to recall one sister. Would it be worth hiring a private investigator? This time we're going back in April. I am his first granddaughter 33 years old and will accompany him.\n Both his grandparents lived in Thai Binh, and he lived there with them before he went to school in Hanoi with his parents.\n His father, Yet Van Nguyen\n Mother, Do Thi Nguyen\n Grandfather, Tuat Van Nguyen born 07/15/1935. He did spend some time in Paris, I think when he was about in his 20s. Someone took him under his wing but he left back to Vietnam to search again.\n https://preview.redd.it/yibnv9tnfpca1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ede314085bb785588c2c329ddef4c395349967d\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Cow9878  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently planning on flying to Hanoi mid Sept, spending a couple days there and bussing to Ha Giang, doing the loop on motorbike then coming back. \n My bday is at the end of the trip and I'd like to splurge a little at a luxury-ish resort or something where I can really chill out and be taken care of. From what I've read so far, current top of the list is Da Nang, but just wanted to see if anyone has any other good recs. \n Wants\n -Remote-ish, not overly touristy but still some kind of town action we can walk to for food, beers, etc.\n -Resort with a pool, preferably overlooking the beach\n -Proximity to other towns/beaches so we can rent scooters and go on little day trips\n Recommendations on Towns or actual resorts would be amazing!\n    submitted by    /u/konantheronan  \n [link]   [comments]",

My dad got an MBA during the 1990s, and he went back home to work for an insurance company. My mom obtained a law degree in Vietnam and worked in a different field. My question is: what kind of jobs can my parents do? Obviously, I will be the person who helps them start over and climb the social ladder, but at the same time, I don't want them to struggle in old age. Can my dad start over and work at a company with his US degree, even though it will take several years to adjust and improve his English? What kind of jobs can my mom do? I have heard a lotta became nail techs, but I'm unsure if she could handle all the drama and long working hours. I honestly love them so much for all the work they put in to send me here, so at least I want to help them with a new life :( If any of yall in similar boats, I would love to hear yall your experiences!!\n    submitted by    /u/Nngpgtrang  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't remember and apparently didn't write down anywhere the names or specific locations of either of these places and google isn't helping me.

Some of my hotels do offer airport transportation, but I can't figure out if their quoted prices are a serious upcharge compared to Grab.\n I've been to other countries before where ride share apps are available, but cars are limited (eg, it takes 30-40 minutes to get a car and the car cancels multiple times.) Is this a cause for concern with Grab in Vietnam?\n Hoping to ask for your insight about transportation and the reliability, availability, and pricing of Grab in:\n  \nSaigon Airport to District 3 around 11pm: Are cars available at this time? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?\n Hanoi airport to old town: I believe I've read on a Reddit thread that the car picking you up is not the one the app promised. Is this still the case? What would the pricing be?\n Halong Bay port to Van Don Airport: This is the one I'm worried about the most. Is Grab availability quick here? If not, does anyone have recommendations on how to get to the airport? Any companies you use that you recommend?\n Da Nang Airport to Hoi An: Are grabs available and reliable here? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?\n  \nAs a female, my primary concern is safety, reliability, and flexibility. Our group is 3 people: will this change the type of car we need for Grab?\n Thank you so much for any insight you can give on any of these cities and your experiences in transportation here!

          "description": "Hello!\n So, I'm suffering from misophonia. Misophonia basically means you react extremely sensitive to some sounds. Not just - I don't like that sound - but full on rage / anxiety / panic / fear / aggression triggered immediately upon being subjected to it. It can be conditional though - meaning a sound only triggers that reaction in some context but not in others.\n Sounds like that for me are bass from music (no problem with bass from music I hear myself or when going to a night club but when trying to sleep f.x.). People smacking while eating. \n Now - why do I direct this question specifically at Vietnamese people and not expats or tourists reading this? Well, Vietnam is a very loud culture and to make things worse sound proofing of buildings here doesn't seem to exist. At least I have never \"seen\" any. Windows especially are always leaking air and because of that sound from outside.\n So, I'd assume that a misophonically challenged person would be suffering a lot. But, is misophonia even a problem here? Maybe being subjected to very loud sounds all the time since birth provides immunity to it? Do you know of Vietnamese misophonics - are you one yourself? What are your triggers? How do you cope? How do you arrange yourself with it?\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Fine-Technician-8752  \n [link]   [comments]",

I made a dumb mistake and put in the wrong last name, her birth name instead of the name she has now after the marriage. After being in contact with support from 12go.asia, they informed me that you have to request the change at least 3 days before departure date. I know it was my mistake but I just can't believe that you can't change something like this before the flight. Does anybody have experience with this? Could we just show up at the airport and try to change it there?

          "description": "Tesla has recently decreased its Model Y prices from $66,000 to only $53,000 and the Model Y Performance now starts at only $57,000 with a 0-60 time of 3.5 seconds and 303 miles of range as well (down from 330 miles on the Base Model Y). With the Vinfast VF 8 still starting at $59,000 despite having less track record than Tesla, what do you now think of the Vinfast VF 8 and what are your opinions of Vinfast now, given the fact the Tesla Model Y is now cheaper (in fact, the 7-seat interior on the Model Y is only $4000 more than the 5-seat interior)?\n I am also curious who would buy the Vinfast over the Tesla Model Y, if any, outside of Vietnam, and what measures Vinfast would need to address to succeed, or they would fail regardless?\n For me, I do think Vinfast should just halve their price to be competitive:\n The Vinfast VF 8 could be $29k trying to steal market share from the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5/CX-50, Hyundai Santa Fe/Tucson, Kia Sorento/Sportage, Nissan Rogue, Mitsubishi Outlander, Subaru Forester, etc.\n The Vinfast VF 9 could be $42k trying to steal market share from the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Mazda CX-9, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Nissan Pathfinder, Subaru Ascent, Chevy Traverse, Ford Explorer, etc.\n I am actually Vietnamese by the way, born in Vietnam and currently living in the US and after seeing Tesla prices drop, if I had to choose between the Tesla Model Y and the Vinfast VF 8, I would choose the Tesla Model Y Long Range. Also, a review of the 'quirks and features' of the Vinfast VF 8 will be coming soon as I am heading to Montreal this weekend to film a video over at the Vinfast store. \n    submitted by    /u/MussleGeeYem  \n [link]   [comments]",

After the assault, there has also been rumors that 2 of them has attempted to commit suicide, with 1 of them successfully killing herself.\n The first video is the screams during the incident. When the girl screamed for help, it could be heard that one of the guy shouted 'Banh rộng chân ra', which roughly means 'Spread your legs out'.\n The second one is the body being carried away after one of the students committed suicide.\n After the stories went viral on Facebook, the military school published a notice about the subject passing it off as 'internal conflict' and that 'no harm was caused'. The official Facebook page of the university (HUFLIT) has posted this document on their offical pages.\n Other images are messages from the fellow students at the school.\n You can find the media mentioned here: https://imgur.com/a/xdEnLh5\n A (public) Google Photos link with more images: https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOAfVRaI-jknro-ldZPbGavinjp9Y9dinMLoEGtWXah8OgjGurmF6ZJHvxhaBjFig?key=VFFNaGtfblNyMzN1ZHh0VFB4YThVNmVTd18tX2pB\n To know more, it is helpful to go on Twitter and search for the keyword 'HUFLIT'.\n edit 1 - added the name of the university\n edit 2 - added more details about the first video\n edit 3 - added google photos link\n    submitted by    /u/dump_acc151  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was invited this year to go on a trip with my husbands family (who moved here along with my husband from vietnam only a few years ago), to participate in a more cultural lunar new year than their typical. They live in america, and since moving here they just stay home for the holiday. It seems that they are very excited to go on this trip, and i want to show my appreciation in any way possible. There is a strong language barrier between us, we mostly only communicate through my husband. I am wondering, what are some possible gifts i can bring them to show them my appreciation? I have done my research, but as an outsider i do not want to overstep and i feel a little insecure about giving them traditional gifts. I need to know if this is just me. For example, would it be overstepping if i wore a red dress? Or would it excite them that i want to participate like that? Would i be weird if i brought them lucky flowers? Any insight at all would be very appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/rmn011  \n [link]   [comments]",

He used to celebrate pretty heavily with his immediate and extended family when he was younger, but the whole family has since stopped celebrating like they used to and I want to start up the celebrations again with him this year since I think it could be really nostalgic for him. I plan to decorate and cook, but what about gifts?\n I know that traditionally gifts of money are usually given to younger members of the family, so would it be weird if I got him a gift? I just really love gift giving and will look for any excuse to get him presents, but I don't want it to be weird if it seems inappropriate for this particular holiday. If it wouldn't be weird, what are some possible gift ideas that would be fitting? He really loves white tea, hates sweet things, and is always appreciative of plants if that helps.\n I remember him fondly reminiscing on the fun of red envelopes, and since it would be kind of awkward to give him money I had the idea of using the red envelopes to make a scavenger hunt for him. Thoughts on this idea? Too weird? Brutal honesty is appreciated, I'm still learning but it's hard to get an idea of what he would enjoy for Tet without spoiling the surprise of all my plans\n Thanks so much for any and all help!\n    submitted by    /u/FindThePants2019  \n [link]   [comments]",

Afterwards they invited us in for drinks (it was just my husband and I and her, her husband and kids), and now she says they've had great luck this past year (good health, built a big new house, etc.) so she would like us to be officially invited for the evening this year lol.

I get a bit overwhelmed about the times during Tet when you do the specific things etc - I was just wondering if I should prepare a gift that would be \"lucky\"?

From food, to nearby spots?\n The places I’m eyeing to visit are: - About 1-2 days in Hanoi - Hoi An - Ninh Binh - And Ha Long Bay.\n Questions:\n  \nWould it be good to spend 1 day in each town?\n What would be a good itinerary?\n Is Ha Long Bay worth it?

Yes, Vietnamese movies have some serious censorship but at least they can still make ghost movies and homosexual relationship content.\n Vietnamese leaders can more easily accept criticism from their citizens while Chinese leaders are less tolerant of criticism. Vietnam’s security minister was criticized for eating at a Salt Bae restaurant in London and had to resign. In China, many major scandals are heavily censored and covered up.\n What reasons make the Vietnamese government less authoritarian and more humane than the Chinese government?\n If it’s a case of losing authority? Why is the Vietnamese government more prone to make decisions that risk their authority than the Chinese government is?\n Is the higher humaneness of the Vietnamese government stemming from cultural reasons?\n Vietnam is still repressive and has one of the world’s worst press freedom scores, but the fact that they have access to all Western sites and more political accountability is a clear sign that it is much less authoritarian than China.\n    submitted by    /u/MaxMaxMax_05  \n [link]   [comments]",

My mom is currently visiting Da Nang and she went around looking for ao dais and couldn’t find anything to her/my liking, she told me that the colors and prints are for the spring season or for tet. I don’t mind waiting since I’m still planning my wedding, I don’t need it right away but just want to look and find the print and fabric that I like. She also told me the cost for two ao dais are roughly $500-$600 US dollars, does this cost sound right? I told my mom I don’t mind paying for that price but she kept telling me that it’s expensive.

Last time I went to Vietnam was in 2015 so I’m pretty excited. \n We’ll be spending the first week in Saigon, second week at my grandparents to celebrate Tet, and the third week in Phu Quoc Island. \n There is one thing I’m worried about and that’s losing my phone. I’m worried about getting it stolen while in Saigon. It’s pretty crowded there so I’m a bit paranoid. \n My phone is super important to me so I don’t wanna lose it. I’ll be wearing a fanny pack and I want to take a lot of photos and record videos while I’m there. \n That’s also the problem. What if someone walks past me and snatches my phone while I’m recording? Or if someone on a motorcycle drives by and snatches it.\n When I was in Vietnam in 2015, I was just a child so I didn’t have a phone at the time so there was nothing to worry about. Anyone got some advice? What should I think about? \n I’d also appreciate suggestions on nice restaurants and places to visit!\n    submitted by    /u/Tooonyyyy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking for a travel buddy for activities such as hiking, walking, cultural exploration, volunteer, eco friendly tour... if you are planning to travel around Hanoi and througout Vietnam during this time and want more company, please let me know. I will be based in Hanoi and ideally looking for day trip, or out of town 2-4 days then ilback to Hanoi. \n I was born and grew up in the Old Quarter of Hanoi but have been living oversea since 19yo. I still have many friends and family in Vietnam. I just visited Vietnam end of last year so have catched up on most family/friends and gatherings. I also realized my recreational interests have changed now (probably due to age and living in NZ) and more into activities such as town/market walk around, hiking, walking track, cultural experience...my friends in VN will just take me to a cool cafe or new restaurant everytime and i have started to feel I have enough of it. \n So if you are like-minded, I would love to hear from you.\n    submitted by    /u/babu0205  \n [link]   [comments]",

I suppose they're trying to cut budget (or encourage us to work more??). What's your take on this? Is this even legal according to the labour laws for foreigners in VN?\n Please note: I'm not naming and shaming, I just want to have a better understanding of this so I can weight my options (either to stay or leave).\n Thank you in advance.\n https://preview.redd.it/ac2op212oz9a1.jpg?width=842&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a5d0b4a02d40224ddc86612e7596c80ed2dfdc6\n    submitted by    /u/thrownaway__employee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just returned home after 3-ish years in a god forsaken frozen corn field and noticed that there are now these yellow license plates everywhere. They're on buses, taxis, ubers/grabs, trucks, etc. I also noticed that some of the yellow plates also have \"contract vehicle\" (xe hợp đồng) stickered somewhere on the frame or windows.\n ​\n What do these yellow plates mean? Are they like company/corporate vehicles or something? The one commonality I can find is that they are all work/commercial vics of some sort (as opposed to private/personal transport).\n ​\n I could have sworn that there weren't these yellow plates back before I left. I'm almost certain that back then all the taxis, busses, and grabs still used the normal white plates.

Of course, JetStar is blaming Vietnam airlines, who connected my flight from Saigon to Hanoi. I am now trying to submit a compensation claim with Vietnam Airlines, but all the resources point me to the general information and the form, which I have already filled out. My question is simply what email address do I contact/who do I send my claim to at Vietnam Airlines?\n I’m already past the 7 day notification period but given my deadlings with tracing and that I’ve been out of reception for much of my time here I’m hopeful I can shake them down. \n Thanks so much.\n    submitted by    /u/BePseudoEverything  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Xin Chào!\n This is going to be our third time visiting Việt Nam. Until now, we mostly used air planes and trains. This time we would like to spend more time, so we would like to go in smaller steps to see more places. It seems the usual way to travel is by bus. How does the bus system work in general and after Covid? Is there one public transportation system or are there also privat companies. Would you also take taxies into account? When should we use which kind of transportation? Our route currently looks like the following:\n Sài Gòn -> Mỹ Tho -> Cần Thơ -> Sài Gòn -> Phan Thiết and Phan Rang <-> Đà Lạt <-> Buôn Ma Thuột -> Tuy Hòa -> Quy Nhơn -> Pleiku -> Kon Tum -> Hôi An and Đà Nẵng (<-> denotes that the order is not yet decided)\n Our plan is to take the train where applicable.\n Though, this is only the first half of our route as we would like to continue our route to Hà Nội in a similar style for another 30 days, but we have not looked into it too much yet. We hope this is a reasonable route to travel.\n    submitted by    /u/dagobahwarrior  \n [link]   [comments]",

We planned on doing Dalat, Mui Ne and Hoi An but the weather is terrible :(.\n We've already spent a few days in Hanoi and did Ha Long Bay, and while we love it we don't want to spend another 9 days there after Phu Quoc (leaving on the 13th). I've been looking at Ninh Binh / Tam Coc as an option for a 3 day stay, but all tours seem to leave from Hanoi to that area, and everything I'm reading says to do that area on a scooter but I don't have a bike license and my partner isn't comfortable driving one on her own.\n Is finding local tours easy in that area?. Any other suggestions for the north of Vietnam?.

We stayed in an apartment at VinHomes Central Park, largely because it was convenient to get to the NYE fireworks on the river. Like, a ten minute walk. Along with a large crowd, we waited for the midnight fireworks to start. \n And waited... and waited... and waited...\n At 12:20, we gave up and took the kids back to the apartment. When we got back, I turned on the TV and loaded the live stream of the Saigon fireworks. Nothing but streams of people leaving the riverside.\n When I got up this morning, I checked the local news, hoping to find an explanation. One news site, VN Express, had a glowing report of the festivities in HCMC along with photos of the \"fireworks display\":\n Vietnam rings in 2023\n This was the only reference I could find, so I've started the new year off with a mystery.\n    submitted by    /u/PiscadorII  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I come from a developing country that can be compared to Vietnam in many ways. But the main difference is the apparent tolerance of the state/authorities to informal businesses, eg street food. Are informal small business tolerated or encouraged ? Is there any form of corruption involved? How does the state collect taxes ? What is the size of the grey economy? How important is a business registration? \n \nMost restaurants, even small and apparently informal ones, have a PoS management software, and many print a receipt. I often see small business managers using calculators and apparently doing their accounting. Similar restaurants/business in my country usually don't even have a logbook (combination of illiteracy and bad management). I know that Vietnam mostly got rid of illiteracy decades ago, but I feel that there's more to this than just knowing how to read and write.\n \nI mostly think of the vietnamese as one of the most industrious people on the planet. But on rare occasions, i meet people that seem even lazier than my countrymen, usually the younger ones. Especially in cafés, waiters seem incredibly slow and unprofessional. What's happening here ? What am I missing?\n \n Sorry if my questions are ingenuous. I just want to better understand the vietnamese society.\n    submitted by    /u/elmirak  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently an American ESL teacher based in Saigon took to social platforms to expose the truth about the rampant sexual harrasment in a Vietnamese High School (Nguyen Thi Dieu).\n 1/Upon seeing a female highschooler being forced to remove her jacket and inappropriately touched by a security guard at school, Teacher Kenny apparently stood up for her by using physical force against the guard. Kenny was furious and was asking for an investigation as this has happened numerous times before with other students. \n 2/There is CCTV footage documenting the guard being inapproprate with students in his office : forcing them to undress to check their nametag, inappropriate touching and groping female students. The school board forced everyone to stay silent and threatened to destroy Kenny's teaching career in Saigon if he went on to draw attention to the case. The guard, on the other hand, only got off with a warning. \n 3/Teacher Kenny has since spoken up about the incident on many social sites such as Tiktok and Facebook, students who are former victims of harrassment by the guard are also speaking up and trying to gain traction for the case.\n 4/The Vietnamese English teacher, however, is bribing students with exam points if they stay silent or inform her about the ones who side with Kenny on social media. She called students \"stupid\" for siding with a \"white westerner\", threatened various UNDERAGE students for making tiktoks defending the victims and teachers. An adult woman who is an educator is going around spreading racism and threatening minors.\n Here's a link to Kenny's tiktok : https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS86jpE2w/\n Facebook : Kenneth Goins\n    submitted by    /u/Normie-Chloe22  \n [link]   [comments]",

If anyone has any advice on pronunciation that would be helpful too, as I find that more difficult as a native English speaker.\n I'm not sure how to phrase it best either, so if anyone has advice regarding that it would be great. I am thinking it would be best to keep it simple, just something like \"No seafood/brazil nuts, I die\" or \"I will die\".\n So far something I have thought of trying is to print out an allergy card with the information on it, but I think it may be good to get other suggestions as well. \n Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/makeshiftswift  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone! I was wondering if anyone has tried the fried chicken at Lotteria in Vietnam and what your thoughts were on it. Personally, I've tried all the big international chains like KFC, Popeyes, and Jollibee, and I have to say that none of them hold a candle to the deliciousness of Lotteria's fried chicken.\n The chicken at Lotteria is always fresh and tender, and the marinade they use is just the right balance of herbs and spices. Plus, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. In comparison, the chicken at the other fast food chains I've tried has been either dry or cold, or both. It's just not the same level of quality as what you'll find at Lotteria.\n Now, I will admit that the rest of the menu at Lotteria leaves something to be desired. The sides are pretty mediocre and the sandwiches and burgers are just okay. And the desserts? Well, let's just say they're not exactly worth writing home about. But despite all that, the chicken at Lotteria is still worth the visit (or delivery) in my opinion.\n So I'm curious to hear what others think - have you tried the fried chicken at Lotteria? What were your thoughts? Is it worth the visit (or delivery)? And if anyone knows of a better fried chicken place in Vietnam, I'd love to hear about it!\n    submitted by    /u/DragonXDT  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was hoping to make some friends whilst we are living in Vietnam so thought I'd post in here. We are 30 and 28 years old and we both love music, going to the gym and bouldering. I love gaming and can also play the bass guitar (would love to start a band actually!). We also both love food and going for a few drinks now and then. \n Please message me if any of our interests align and you would also love to make some new friends! Would be nice to know we aren't alone in the amazing country that is Vietnam!\n    submitted by    /u/tumblejamie  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I live in a smallish town in the South, I am a foreigner and my wife is Vietnamese. I'm pretty embedded in my family and local community and I know that people prefer to handle things \"in house\" or without the police a lot, but I'm just at a loss.\n The house directly behind ours (their back wall forms the wall of our yard) has a woman who is an absolutely insane and abusive nutcase to her very small child, or maybe children I'm not sure. She screams like a lunatic and hits the poor child, which makes it wail this horrific wail I can't take anymore. It's honestly shameful I haven't done anything yet but I just haven't known what to do and everyone here has a very \"mind your own business\" attitude so I don't know who to turn to.\n Last week I was afraid that I was listening to her actually killing her child. There was a pained screaming that only comes from death, and then it suddenly cut off to total silence. I remember though that lately I'd heard a puppy, I think she killed the puppy in front of the child. I heard the child sobbing.\n Who do I contact, what branch of government handles investigations like this? Besides the absolutely over the top regular abuse, I feel like if she really did kill that puppy in front of the kid(s) she may one day kill them too. I don't know, I think maybe she has some really intense post-partum psychosis. Due to the layout of the neighborhood I've never actually seen any of them and I don't know what the front of their house looks like.\n I'm very worried and I am at the point that I can't let my moral cowardice get in the way any longer, something needs to be done.\n Can any Vietnamese people here help me? My wife doesn't hear it because she's rarely in the back yard and while she's normally a very lovely person, I don't think she's taking it seriously and may be worried about social blowback.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Dung_Buffalo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don’t want tips on how to stay cool… I just want to know if it is possible for my body to get used to the heat if I stay for a certain amount of time. I tend to sweat easily and it seems like stepping outside of my hotel would trigger the sweats. Any advice here?

We want to fit in Ha Giang/Sapa, Ninh Binh, Halong Bay, and Hanoi in but the issue is 10 days is a little tight.\n What do you guys think about the 4 day/3 night option vs 3 day/2 nights for Ha Giang Loop? Is it too rushed to do the 3 day option on QT's website? It allows us to fit Ninh Binh and Halong Bay in a bit easier but I'm a little worried that it'll be too rushed to enjoy the loop.\n The other option is to do Sapa instead of the Ha Giang loop which will definitely make the itinerary easier since I think you can definitely fit Sapa in 3 day/2 nights in very easily.\n Thoughts?

I will post the video tonight at 8pm (local time in Vietnam). \n Just like the other catches, this guy stays and tries to talk his way out of the crime he committed. It is illegal to lure a minor.

On a Christmas eve Turkey dinner, there was a big group of people, who were (almost)all wearing white fancy clothes: most of them young and adult ladies but some men, children and at least one old lady. They were almost all wearing white fancy clothes: dresses, lacy shirts etc. Except the old woman was wearing something red & some men had jeans or black trousers. They were also playing some games or giving speeches or something.\n In my culture white fancy clothes are usually something a bridal party wears, or on some other special occasion if everyone is wearing them in unison. I was wondering if this is a cultural thing for a special occasion, as they all looked more Asian than Caucasian, and asked our waiter, what was the occasion end gestured in their general direction (I think I did it discreetly) and our waiter was immediately super apologetic and kept repeating \"I'm so sorry\" and we were super confused, saying \"no need to apologize, it's fine\" etc. and we never got an answer, what was the occasion, and we were left in confusion.\n My SO was giving me shit afterwards for asking it. I never intended it to be anything hurtful or insulting, as they were in high spirits and I think it is okay in many cultures to ask simply \"what's the occasion\" when you see a group or family celebrating. \n So if someone could guess what was the occasion and also tell me if I was an insensitive white biach.\n    submitted by    /u/hipunen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "You may be surprised to know Vietnam has a wonderful cosplay community. There are several groups that organize events year round (usually 1-2 events every month). Currently, there is a Winter Convention Manga Festival going on; it was today and it will also be going on tomorrow too! \n If you are into anime, manga, comics, and cosplay, then you should absolutely check these events out. I have been going to every event for the last 5 months or so. I film short videos (3-5 minutes) showing the cosplayers. I let them do a pose/action for about 5 seconds and show as many as I can. \n You can find the cosplay festival videos by searching YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I have a \"Cosplay!\" playlist from all the events. If you see me there, I am always happy to include you in my videos if you want to be in one. I do it to showcase the cosplay community and let others know about this community in Vietnam. All the people who go are very kind and friendly. Those of us that dress up always allow people to take photos and videos. \n Entry fees for most of the events is around 120,000 VND. Hope to see more new cosplayers in the near future. If you have any questions, just let me know!\n    submitted by    /u/SaigonSterling  \n [link]   [comments]",

The flight leaves Ho Chi Minh City on Saturday Dec 24 at 11:45pm. \n If anyone has basic medical or nursing experience, that would be ideal, but we're not expecting it.\n If you're interested, please direct message me and I'll respond with a Zoom link to give you a rundown on his condition and what to expect. I am in San Francisco and there is a 15-hour time difference so I won't be able to check messages until 8 hours from now during my morning time.\n My brother-in-law is a pleasant 50-year old and his illness relates to his internal organs (he's not contagious).\n    submitted by    /u/zaphine  \n [link]   [comments]",

The country is beautiful, the food and culture are amazing, and I’ve found the people to be the best part of all - extremely gracious, respectful, and hospitable.\n But then I came to Hanoi. And I’m baffled. We had a bus driver sneezing and coughing up phlegm, spitting it into a cup, for the entirety of a three hour bus ride, there and back, without a mask. This morning, we were in a lovely coffee shop. But the girl sitting across from us, working on her laptop, was sneezing uncontrollably and coughing terribly. She was clearly not just under the weather, but very sick. Again, she was not wearing a mask. I made eye contact with a perplexed look on my face and she looked back as though I was the one in the wrong. \n And then a cab just now. The driver coughing every 10 seconds for a 20 minute ride. No mask. \n I know people here wear masks. More than half of the people on motorbikes have them on. What are they for? Do people in Hanoi use them just for pollution? When we were in other cities (Saigon, Hoi An, Ninh Binh, Mai Chau) I saw plenty of people wearing masks inside, and none of the kind of blantant illness that is in Hanoi.\n I’m terribly sorry if this comes off as culturally insensitive. I promise I don’t intend it to be. But coming from the West and other parts of Vietnam, and particularly in a post-Covid world, I’m really perplexed - what is going on in Hanoi?\n    submitted by    /u/goaliebloak  \n [link]   [comments]",
