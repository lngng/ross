          "description": "Chào các bạn!\n So after being very confused why my Vietnamese friend was saying words that end in “oc” as “op,” I decided to do some research. Apparently, in Vietnamese, you have to close your mouth for certain ending constants, so a word ending in ung would sound like “ungm.”\n My question to you guys is how say it. I remember teaching my friends how to properly pronounce the Spanish “t” by placing the tips of their tongues on the top part of the back of their teeth. I realize this question is kind of technical, but everything I’ve looked up doesn’t really address it or attributes it to an different accent or dialect (but both Northerners and Southerners do this from my knowledge).\n Any advice? Many thanks! Cảm ơn!\n I also tagged this as discussion since I can’t seem to get a clear answer on how to do this lingual maneuver.\n    submitted by    /u/gavinoba  \n [link]   [comments]",

But he especially looked at my husband and told me something. Then he sat down next to us on the other table and kept on talking to us. Finally I can hear what he was saying and he kept mumbling how my husband has to learn vietnamese to communicate. He had this painful, almost angry expression on his face. He seems offended my husband doesn't speak vietnamese somehow. \n The staff finally came over and asked him to leave. She was alone so she didn't know how to handle the situation. I asked her about him and she said he seems drunk and not from around the neighborhood. \n Does this happened to any of you? didn't know how to react, was uncomfortable during and after it. he stayed for at least 10mins just talk and talk and talk... so very weird\n    submitted by    /u/Cupcake179  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some (I'm sorry, very, very basic) questions.\n - Is there a good fish sauce flavored snack like chips or crackers I could find for her? I'm in Northern California and there are Vietnamese (or at least large Asian) supermarkets. \n - If I bought her a bottle of fish sauce for her kitchen is there anything likely to be in an American kitchen she could pair it with? Any brands you'd suggest? Is fish sauce something you pretty much need to make yourself?\n - If I stop by a local Vietnamese restaurant, what could I order (and it wouldn't surprise if the answer is 'anything') that would have a lot of fish sauce? Spring rolls?\n ​\n Any help is appreciated!!!\n cảm ơn (looked it up!)\n    submitted by    /u/OurHouse510  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The other night my partner and I were having dinner on P. Mã Mây in Hanoi when two local dudes starting attacking another local dude. Large machetes, axes, and sword like instruments were produced. The parties started swinging them at each other. We were a bit taken back because of the time, only 07:00pm, and it was in a semi busy tourist area. It was literally across from a very popular tattoo place. \n My partner and I got out of there pretty quick smart, but we’re pretty surprised/shocked that this kind of thing happened in a popular street. While both of us have witnessed this kind of violence in our home country (aus), we just weren’t sure what the normal thing to do in Hanoi would be? In Australia, the incident would have incited loads of media and police attention/investigation.\n We kinda just played the ‘eyes shut’ game and didn’t tell anyone about it.\n Should we have reported the incident to local police? Is this a normal thing to happen in Hanoi and is it just underreported to tourists?\n    submitted by    /u/Positive_Effect2608  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am quite worried. Please help.\n I’m a dual-citizen: Armenian and American. I arrived into Laos today from Thailand with my Armenian passport and I had a visa for it. The border patrol rejected my entry because they wanted me to get into Laos using my American passport given that I got Thai entry/exit stamps in that passport. So I had to reapply with a visa on arrival using my American passport. This caught me by surprise because I’ve switched my passport several times while visiting countries and it has never been a problem.\n AND I’m going to Vietnam in 2 days and I have a visa approval for Vietnam under my Armenian passport again. A worker at Laos’ immigration said it’s fine if I enter Vietnam and that the rules are different but I want to be sure. Vietnamese consulates in Laos are closed for the weekend and I can’t get help from anyone. Does anyone have more information about this? Does Vietnam allow passport swapping?\n Note: there’s no visa on arrival for Armenians or Americans.\n    submitted by    /u/JeanJauresJr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I do not think the news was already posted here, but the Michelin Guide is coming in Vietnam. First edition of the guide will be released in June.\n I think it’s a great think for Vietnam – It will help a lot the restaurants aiming to offer fine dining especially Vietnamese ones.\n What are your prognostics about the potential decorated restaurant in Vietnam?\n My opinion:\n - No 3 Stars Restaurants. I really do not think any venue in Vietnam is there yet. Bangkok does not have any 3 Stars Restaurants.\n - Anan Saigon: I really see them decorated. I tried them few years ago it was great, but it seems what they offer now is more elaborated. It’s the only restaurant in Vietnam that made to Asia’s Top 50 + their food relates a lot to Vietnam\n - I also think that the Guide will give one Star to a good Street food stall / place either in Ha Noi or HCMC. The guide did that both in Thailand (Jay bee) and Singapore. It’s a way for them to not appear too snobbish and it’s good PR…\n - Maybe one or two high end French Restaurants from Ho Chi Minh City: I have tried 3 Gourmands / La Villa / P’tit Saigon / Le Corto. All of them are great but I guess inspectors of the guide have been eating a lot in “similar” restaurants. I am just not sure if they will be \"good enough\" to get one Stars with French Cuisine. I could also add La Badiane in Ha Noi to this list.\n - One or more Japanese Restaurant? Likely – There is so many great Japanese Restaurant both in Hanoi et HCMC. I have just not tried enough of them to have an any name in mind.\n For the locals not familiar with how the Guide works ( I have seen many mistakes both on Facebook and local news sites) we wrote this article: https://amthuchiendai.vn/tat-ca-nhung-gi-can-biet-ve-cam-nang-michelin/\n    submitted by    /u/mebetyoufold  \n [link]   [comments]",

Does anyone know anything more about this? \n Btw, I am planning to move when I finish my degree in the next few years or so.\n Edit: not looking to be an elected representative or anything. More like administrative work ie: assisting with permits/ regulations.\n    submitted by    /u/Captain_armor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi I was wondering whether it would be possible to cycle the Ha Giang Loop? I am planning on heading to Vietnam in the second half of August and am desperate to travel on the Ha Giang Loop but not on a motorbike and also not someone else taking me. I am a very capable cyclist but I was basically wondering if it was possible and safe? I would be happy to make it a large proportion of the trip so if there would be any safer potentially longer routes/roads? And where would be a good place to hire or purchase a good quality bike ( may be cheaper just buying) but would rather hire? I understand this is not the usual way to do the loop but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much\n    submitted by    /u/Minimum_Word2434  \n [link]   [comments]",

Dont really care if there are ladies or not, that's not my objective but if there are it wont bother me either and faux british pubs aren't really my thing either lol.

          "description": "Xin chào các bạn!\n I'm Vietnamese-American (28F) and have visited my family in Việt Nam several times. But, the last time I visited was in 2016. My husband and I are planning a long vacation in Việt Nam late summer this year and I was wondering what street fashion for young adults in their 20s is like now, for both men and women. My husband is white so he's going to stand out no matter what, so I'm not worried about looking like I am a \"local\", but am really just interested in how street fashion has changed since I last visited and what is commonplace now. \n In college, I met an exchange student from Việt Nam and when he saw me wearing short running shorts, he was appalled and asked why I was wearing those. I was confused why he was so shocked and he said in Việt Nam, only prostitutes wear shorts that short (they were like...mid-thigh length). This was back in 2014, though... I have no idea how accurate that reaction was to what's commonplace though because I've never been there long enough to really notice or outside of my family's district to see much else. \n Cảm ơn nhiều!\n    submitted by    /u/polyhymnia2000  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I would like to know how is the worklife in Vietnam (e.g. working style, hours)? Obviously companies are not the same - is there a large difference when working in a Western company and local?\n My concern comes from previous experience, when I was working in a Chinese company, and did not find the working style to be suitable for me. I felt that there was not enough freedom to conduct work within the strict corporate hierarchy. Also, had too much unnecessary work (internal processes), which requires constant overtime. Are Chinese and Vietnamese working styles similar or different?\n I'm currently working in senior management, and I'm not able to speak Vietnamese.\n All comments highly appreciated!\n Tldr: planning to move to Vietnam, would like to know more about the worklife\n    submitted by    /u/Beet-Bandit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Usually when you go to the more diverse provinces (Lào Cai, Hà Giang, ...), the hotels are all run by Kinh people. I once asked a hotelier in Sapa about this and he said 'they [referring to Hmong/Dao] don't know how to run businesses', which was amusingly direct.\n Anyway, any good recommendations in scenic areas in the far North? I would love to fall asleep to the sound of a different language (Hmong, Dao, Tày, anything really) being spoken by the proprietor's family.

Food was amazing, the street food blew my mind, I ate banh mi twice a day, daily and never got sick of it. Never got to try pho but I had bun bo hue and others which I don't knkw what it was, I just pointed the picture, nod and bow a little cause I felt bad that I couldn't speak Vietnamese.\n My mistake was not knowing that Vietnamese was celebrating Lunar New Year and most shops were closed for 3 to 4 days and we didnt get to see, eat most of the food we wanted to try, experience the culture, went to vung tau on the 4th day instead, wrong choice I would say because I think the locals went there for holiday or went back to their hometown, that's my assumption, so the traffic was pretty heavy but it was a fun.\n I should have gone there on the 5th day of Lunar New Year/Chinese New Year but all and all, it was an amazing place, fell in love with Vietnam just like how I fell in love with Japan when I first visited it, Extremely friendly, yes I can't express enough the friendliness of the Vietnamese\n My next trip is to visit Hanoi, any recommendations of place to visit?

I don't drive and usually walk everywhere, I've been told I should stay in Tay Ho and it looks great for walking, but I am also wondering whether for a first trip it would be better to stay in Old Quarter? As I would like to also have access to the buses / trains to do trips to Halong Bay / Sapa etc.\n I've actually eyed an apartment which is exactly in between Tay Ho and Old Quarter, near the Tran Quoc Pagoda. Google Maps says it's a 25-30 minutes walk in either direction which i normally would not mind at all, but I've heard horror stories about the traffic in Hanoi so I am wondering whether this is doable or not?\n    submitted by    /u/Takyamoto  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I figured I'd put this here as it is more of a specialist recipe compared to the scope of a more generalist subreddit like r/cooking, and the Vietnamese food subs are not exactly what could be called active or even semi active. \n So I have seen various Vietnamese style grilled eel recipes (example: Chargrilled eel in lemongrass and turmeric (luon nuong xa) recipe : SBS Food) that are very much tickling my fancy. I've thought up a cooking method that sounds to me like it would give good results, but it's not something I have ever seen suggested anywhere else so I have no idea whether it would work.\n Specifically, what I am thinking about is pre-cooking the eel before grilling it by poaching in nuoc cham, and then finishing on the grill. What I hope to accomplish with this is: \n -Getting flavor throughout the eel without having to worry about prematurely denaturing the proteins by using the nuoc cham as the poaching liquid. The lime juice in nuoc cham would do that if the eel was raw, but would not if it was just the cooking liquid because the eel would be cooked before denaturing could happen.\n I also intend to pierce the eel with a fork to get even more flavor throughout, if need be.\n -Setting the stage for a caramelized, crispy finish. The sugars in nuoc cham would be all over the meat and allow for good caramelization.\n As I said though I've never seen this suggested before, so I have troubleshooting questions. Specifically:\n -My primary question: will poaching in nuoc cham make the eel TOO strongly flavored? I like my food a bit more strongly seasoned than most, but as nuoc cham is so strong, I would be cautious about overflavoring here.\n -Would the sugar content end up to more rapid burning than expected when finishing on the grill? I absolutely abhor burnt food so a heads up warning if it is a fine line would be much appreciated.\n Thank you so much and I can't wait to branch out to this area of Vietnam's cuisine!\n    submitted by    /u/CulinaryLightbulb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, a friend and I are flying into Ho chi minh at the end of March. We've roughly planned to spend 10 - 14 days in Vietnam before heading to phuket (probably flying out of Hanoi). It's only my second ever overseas trip, I just have no idea how to go about it. Out of convenience (we will have suitcases) I've planned to stay roughly a week in Ho Chi Minh, explore the surroundings then fly to Hanoi and stay there roughly a week and explore surroundings. I'm just not sure if this is the right way to go about it, I feel like we would be missing out on a lot of stuff if we are just sticking around the main cities. Would it be better to just spend a few days in Ho Chi Minh then head north a few hours each day by car and stay somewhere new every night or every couple of nights? I'd love any suggestions on some good accomodation, sights to see and just any must do activities while in Vietnam. We love all natural wonders such as mountains, national parks, rivers ect but also want to have some time just exploring and hanging out in the cities and experiencing some night life. Taking all suggestions into consideration and any rough itineraries are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Organic-Young-5702  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm seeing more and more women decided to skip matching with white foreigners on dating apps like Bumble. Members in the group share \"sexual escapades\" by white foreigners in Thailand, which recently tighten their immigration policies, and cause a lot of them to \"flee\" to other SEA countries like Vietnam. Bald white guys in their 30s are the most obvious skip for these girls, and they are well informed of the LBH that are here on working visas. The language barrier is also another issue they mention, where it's exhausting to use Google translate for every little thing. Many of them share stories of them being coerced into sex by these men, even on first date.\n I'm not really surprised to hear all these stories from Viet girls in both Saigon and Hanoi, and I also translate and share a few of these creeps' posts from reddit on Facebook. Ever since the pandemic Viet people seem to be more wary of white foreigners (they seem more receptive to Koreans and other Asians)\n Of course, some of the more malicious girls like to take these naive foreigners on a wild ride with expensive dates then ditch them.\n    submitted by    /u/ImplementOpposite425  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I wanted to ask here to see what y'all know about it and preferably if you could also point me in the direction of any sources(preferred is english because I don't know how to read or type vietnamese but I can make do with google translate.) \n I also wanted to ask how people in vietnam generally view the creature.\n In China and Japan they range from pure evil, to harmless pranksters, to very kind and benevolent beings.\n In Korea, they are seen as purely malevolent creatures\n So I wanted to know how Vietnam generally views them. Do they range from being good to evil? Or are they just evil?\n What powers do they have, generally speaking?\n And the most important one is, how do they get their many tails?

Had a breakup of my 2 year relationship, with the person I moved over to Vietnam with and subsequently lost my job due to needing time off to process that. In addition to these personal things, the pollution bothers me and I still haven’t yet mastered driving a motorbike because I had a pretty nasty crash which has put me off for the time being. \n In my head I’m imagining a move to HCM to be much better, I previously lived in Shanghai and I do prefer the feeling of a big metropolis - but I guess the problems with traffic are even worse there? I’ve struggled to find contemporary art and music events, and it seems like there is more of that type of thing in HCM. \n Or do I have completely the wrong idea? Should I move somewhere else entirely?

          "description": "Foreigner here. I go to my wife's hometown pretty often, so for the last four years, I've joined in a lot of celebrations and ran into a lot of the same faces. The \"anh\"s and \"chú\"s still really like to drink with me and I'm always sort of a VIP at gatherings despite being more of an introvert and not good in large gatherings.\n My problem: a lot of these guys think it's so fun to ask me what their names are in front of everyone, and more often than not, I don't remember. It's always the same super embarrassing moment when I'm racking my brain to think of this guy's name while everyone is either cringing or laughing at me. And then they tell me their name but because I'm so mortified, I just can't even remember it later even if I make a mental note. My Vietnamese is intermediate, but a lot of these guys in the village have names that I don't know the meanings of, so hard to draw connections...\n This is why gatherings in my wife's hometown are not fun for me. I'm always on edge, and when I sit down around a \"mâm\", I need to look around and see if there's anyone I don't know or remember and try to listen for their name in conversation. \n So what should I do to stop looking like such an asshole who can't be bothered to learn people's name and how to better diffuse the situation when it inevitably happens that I don't know a name?\n    submitted by    /u/sillymanbilly  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you HAD to pick 1 (maaaybe 2) of these experiences, what's your pick?\n 3ish days to trek in Sapa\n 4 days motorbiking the Ha Giang Loop\n 3 days with a guided cave expedition in Phong Nha\n 3 days motorbiking/trekking in Dalat\n Some background info: my wife and I are in our late 20's and love combining city life, food, culture, and nature/adventure on our trips. If anything, it's hard for us to 'chill' and slow down while traveling, but we're certainly trying to embody that on this trip more than others :)\n    submitted by    /u/human_raisedbyhumans  \n [link]   [comments]",

With a brief google search I've found that as long as my cat fits in a carry on bag under my seat, has her rabies shot, documents with her history of vaccines, and a vet approved letter she should be able to fly and enter the country with me. \n I'd love to know if anyone can share their experience travelling with a pet to Vietnam and if I am missing any information.

Please help me (39F and Canadian) do something kind for my Vietnamese immigrant neighbours (late 20s M/F and 3F) for Lunar New Year tomorrow.\n They are such good neighbours! They made me pho when I had surgery and they feed my children homemade spring rolls. One time the Ba Noi was visiting from Vietnam and she made me shrimp in banana leaves but I didn’t know how to eat it. I tried to ask the Ba Noi but she doesn’t speak English so I just tried to take a bite out of the banana leaf. The Ba Noi laughed and laughed and showed me how to unwrap them and eat the shrimp.\n Their little 3F comes over to play with my kids almost every day and we just love her so much. Her parents work so hard — six days a week and long hours. They are such good people and I’m so happy to know them. \n Anyhow, tomorrow is Lunar New Year and I know they usually have a big party with their Vietnamese friends and set off fireworks. \n I read that usually you give gifts of money in red envelopes for Lunar New Year. Would that be appropriate for me, their white Canadian neighbour, to bring over tomorrow?\n My two concerns are that I don’t want them to feel that they have to invite me to their party, reciprocate the gift or make them uncomfortable. Also I don’t want to accidentally do something unlucky.\n Thank you Reddit for any advice you can give me!\n    submitted by    /u/CABJames  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are considering a month summer trip on the Vietnam SE coast. Potentially flying into Denang and spending a week in Hoi An and then maybe flying or night bus/train to Nha Trang and staying there for 3 weeks for relaxing beach time. \n I’ve read you can’t rent a car in Vietnam and we would not feel comfortable riding scooters with our kid (or even probably just an adult 🤣). \n The places I’m looking at to stay are not in the city center so we can have more space and a pool. We already live in a high rise in a big SE Asian city, so I’d prefer a villa experience while on vacation. \n My husband thinks having to use Grab multiple time a day if you want to grocery shop, eat out, visit a different beach will be a huge hassle and the cost will add up. This feels like a dealbreaker to him and he thinks we should scrap the Vietnam idea and go to a different country. :(. I read about hiring a car with driver for a few weeks. This sounds pretty weird to me and maybe awkward, but I figured I need to explore this option.\n How do you find a trusted driver like that? Through your villa rental management staff or is their a reputable company people use? I’ve read about scams where drivers will try to take you to restaurants or tours that give them a commission, which I want to avoid. \n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/travel4_EA  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow Redditors,\n I am a 47-year-old Belgian man who has had the pleasure of visiting Vietnam 12 times, spending a total of 16 months there. Through my interactions with the South Vietnamese community where I live, as well as my multiple visits and online relationships, I have become fluent in speaking and writing in Vietnamese. In fact, when a native Vietnamese speaker hears me on the phone, they often mistake me for a Vietnamese person. In addition to my fluency in Vietnamese, I also speak French, Dutch and English, and have a basic understanding of German.\n My dream is to find a job in South Vietnam, but I am facing a bit of a hurdle. I have been working for the government since 1996 and therefore do not have any other qualifications beyond my high school diploma. Additionally, I have no concrete proof of the skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout my career. However, I am skilled in working with computers and have strong communication abilities. My current job involves designing templates that are sent to millions of citizens, but the software I use is not utilized by any companies in Vietnam.\n I am willing to accept a salary that is typical for Vietnam, as money is not a concern for me. My only qualifications are my high school diploma and my work experience, so my CV is essentially my career. I am open to any job, but I am unsure of the best course of action. Should I try to find a job while on a tourist visa and do visa runs until I secure employment? Or, should I enroll in a school in Ho Chi Minh City in order to obtain a student visa? I believe my English and Vietnamese language abilities are sufficient to pass any necessary tests, and I am eager to immerse myself in the educational experience.\n All I know is that I am happiest when I am in Vietnam, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to make my dream a reality. Thank you for reading and for your responses.\n    submitted by    /u/Environmental-Owl383  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short ever since then I've been feeling some type of way towards her (in a good way not a bad way).\n Growing up in Canada I've never really had the need to say new year wishes in Vietnamese to my other friends here but rather just my grandparents and parents. So I'm used to saying things like chúc mừng năm mới.. or con chúc ông bà nhiều xúc khỏe song lâu tram tuoi etc. \n So my question is are there any ideas on how I can send her new year wishes without just the plain chúc mừng năm mới? In other words what are some ways to send wishes from friend to friend. \n From the top of my head in the context of friend to friend, I can only think of wishing for good health, happiness and lots of money. \n Apologies if this question came out kind of odd or if i'm overthinking it.\n    submitted by    /u/danky_n  \n [link]   [comments]",

However after watching vids on youtube and reading, wondering if we should just skip Saigon and spread say 2 days to the cities mentioned above. Is it worth visiting giving our amount of days in VN? I've heard people say they wouldn't have been sad if they skip it while others say it's a must visit. Also how many days of each cities is sufficient.\n Any suggestions would be helpful. thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Latter_Strawberry_78  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm from Germany and my gf and her family are from Hanoi. As I have a genuine personal interest in history in general and Vietnamese history in particular, I would like to ask my parents-in-law about their experiences in the American War.\n They are in their early 70s and I know he was a soldier in the NVA. Would it be acceptable to bring this topic up in a respectful way and in an appropriate setting (e.g. during a one-on-one conversation while going for a walk, not at the family dinner table)?\n I'm asking because - unsurprisingly - WWII is still a touchy topic in Germany. But these two wars are obviously very different, with Germany being the aggressor and committing genocide. My own grandparents never talkes about WWII, although the topic was still always weirdly present in the background.\n I've done a bit of reading beforehand (Last Night I Dreamed of Peace by Đặng Thùy Trâm, The Sorrow of War by Bảo Ninh, The Peguin History of Modern Vietnam by Christopher Goscha) and watched the Ken Burns documentary about the War, so I wouldn't be totally ignorant and ask dumb/insensitive questions.\n    submitted by    /u/Insocyad  \n [link]   [comments]",

His father was a locksmith. This is all I can gather from him as it is it is a very sensitive topic. We are heading back to Vietnam to search for his parents, or any members of his family, in Saigon and then making our way to Hanoi. I am hoping I can get a head start with some search tips online. It seems the best way to go searching for this would be to look at church records but unfortunately, I need help on the ground. Or any sort of obituary. He seemed to recall one sister. Would it be worth hiring a private investigator? This time we're going back in April. I am his first granddaughter 33 years old and will accompany him.\n Both his grandparents lived in Thai Binh, and he lived there with them before he went to school in Hanoi with his parents.\n His father, Yet Van Nguyen\n Mother, Do Thi Nguyen\n Grandfather, Tuat Van Nguyen born 07/15/1935. He did spend some time in Paris, I think when he was about in his 20s. Someone took him under his wing but he left back to Vietnam to search again.\n https://preview.redd.it/yibnv9tnfpca1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ede314085bb785588c2c329ddef4c395349967d\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Cow9878  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I've read so far, current top of the list is Da Nang, but just wanted to see if anyone has any other good recs. \n Wants\n -Remote-ish, not overly touristy but still some kind of town action we can walk to for food, beers, etc.\n -Resort with a pool, preferably overlooking the beach\n -Proximity to other towns/beaches so we can rent scooters and go on little day trips\n Recommendations on Towns or actual resorts would be amazing!\n    submitted by    /u/konantheronan  \n [link]   [comments]",

My dad got an MBA during the 1990s, and he went back home to work for an insurance company. My mom obtained a law degree in Vietnam and worked in a different field. My question is: what kind of jobs can my parents do? Obviously, I will be the person who helps them start over and climb the social ladder, but at the same time, I don't want them to struggle in old age. Can my dad start over and work at a company with his US degree, even though it will take several years to adjust and improve his English? What kind of jobs can my mom do? I have heard a lotta became nail techs, but I'm unsure if she could handle all the drama and long working hours. I honestly love them so much for all the work they put in to send me here, so at least I want to help them with a new life :( If any of yall in similar boats, I would love to hear yall your experiences!!\n    submitted by    /u/Nngpgtrang  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some of my hotels do offer airport transportation, but I can't figure out if their quoted prices are a serious upcharge compared to Grab.\n I've been to other countries before where ride share apps are available, but cars are limited (eg, it takes 30-40 minutes to get a car and the car cancels multiple times.) Is this a cause for concern with Grab in Vietnam?\n Hoping to ask for your insight about transportation and the reliability, availability, and pricing of Grab in:\n  \nSaigon Airport to District 3 around 11pm: Are cars available at this time? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?\n Hanoi airport to old town: I believe I've read on a Reddit thread that the car picking you up is not the one the app promised. Is this still the case? What would the pricing be?\n Halong Bay port to Van Don Airport: This is the one I'm worried about the most. Is Grab availability quick here? If not, does anyone have recommendations on how to get to the airport? Any companies you use that you recommend?\n Da Nang Airport to Hoi An: Are grabs available and reliable here? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?\n  \nAs a female, my primary concern is safety, reliability, and flexibility. Our group is 3 people: will this change the type of car we need for Grab?\n Thank you so much for any insight you can give on any of these cities and your experiences in transportation here!

          "description": "Hello!\n So, I'm suffering from misophonia. Misophonia basically means you react extremely sensitive to some sounds. Not just - I don't like that sound - but full on rage / anxiety / panic / fear / aggression triggered immediately upon being subjected to it. It can be conditional though - meaning a sound only triggers that reaction in some context but not in others.\n Sounds like that for me are bass from music (no problem with bass from music I hear myself or when going to a night club but when trying to sleep f.x.). People smacking while eating. \n Now - why do I direct this question specifically at Vietnamese people and not expats or tourists reading this? Well, Vietnam is a very loud culture and to make things worse sound proofing of buildings here doesn't seem to exist. At least I have never \"seen\" any. Windows especially are always leaking air and because of that sound from outside.\n So, I'd assume that a misophonically challenged person would be suffering a lot. But, is misophonia even a problem here? Maybe being subjected to very loud sounds all the time since birth provides immunity to it? Do you know of Vietnamese misophonics - are you one yourself? What are your triggers? How do you cope? How do you arrange yourself with it?\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Fine-Technician-8752  \n [link]   [comments]",

I made a dumb mistake and put in the wrong last name, her birth name instead of the name she has now after the marriage. After being in contact with support from 12go.asia, they informed me that you have to request the change at least 3 days before departure date. I know it was my mistake but I just can't believe that you can't change something like this before the flight. Does anybody have experience with this? Could we just show up at the airport and try to change it there? Would we have to cancel the whole booking or could we just buy a new ticket for her and I could keep my booking, even though I made a booking for 2 people?

          "description": "Tesla has recently decreased its Model Y prices from $66,000 to only $53,000 and the Model Y Performance now starts at only $57,000 with a 0-60 time of 3.5 seconds and 303 miles of range as well (down from 330 miles on the Base Model Y). With the Vinfast VF 8 still starting at $59,000 despite having less track record than Tesla, what do you now think of the Vinfast VF 8 and what are your opinions of Vinfast now, given the fact the Tesla Model Y is now cheaper (in fact, the 7-seat interior on the Model Y is only $4000 more than the 5-seat interior)?\n I am also curious who would buy the Vinfast over the Tesla Model Y, if any, outside of Vietnam, and what measures Vinfast would need to address to succeed, or they would fail regardless?\n For me, I do think Vinfast should just halve their price to be competitive:\n The Vinfast VF 8 could be $29k trying to steal market share from the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5/CX-50, Hyundai Santa Fe/Tucson, Kia Sorento/Sportage, Nissan Rogue, Mitsubishi Outlander, Subaru Forester, etc.\n The Vinfast VF 9 could be $42k trying to steal market share from the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Mazda CX-9, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Nissan Pathfinder, Subaru Ascent, Chevy Traverse, Ford Explorer, etc.\n I am actually Vietnamese by the way, born in Vietnam and currently living in the US and after seeing Tesla prices drop, if I had to choose between the Tesla Model Y and the Vinfast VF 8, I would choose the Tesla Model Y Long Range. Also, a review of the 'quirks and features' of the Vinfast VF 8 will be coming soon as I am heading to Montreal this weekend to film a video over at the Vinfast store. \n    submitted by    /u/MussleGeeYem  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "[TW - rape, suicide]\n Recently there have been stories on Vietnamese Facebook about female students being supposedly raped by other male soldiers at a military school, where they had to go and stay 2 weeks for military training (which is compulsory for most university students in Vietnam). After the assault, there has also been rumors that 2 of them has attempted to commit suicide, with 1 of them successfully killing herself.\n The first video is the screams during the incident. When the girl screamed for help, it could be heard that one of the guy shouted 'Banh rộng chân ra', which roughly means 'Spread your legs out'.\n The second one is the body being carried away after one of the students committed suicide.\n After the stories went viral on Facebook, the military school published a notice about the subject passing it off as 'internal conflict' and that 'no harm was caused'. The official Facebook page of the university (HUFLIT) has posted this document on their offical pages.\n Other images are messages from the fellow students at the school.\n You can find the media mentioned here: https://imgur.com/a/xdEnLh5\n A (public) Google Photos link with more images: https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOAfVRaI-jknro-ldZPbGavinjp9Y9dinMLoEGtWXah8OgjGurmF6ZJHvxhaBjFig?key=VFFNaGtfblNyMzN1ZHh0VFB4YThVNmVTd18tX2pB\n To know more, it is helpful to go on Twitter and search for the keyword 'HUFLIT'.\n edit 1 - added the name of the university\n edit 2 - added more details about the first video\n edit 3 - added google photos link\n    submitted by    /u/dump_acc151  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was invited this year to go on a trip with my husbands family (who moved here along with my husband from vietnam only a few years ago), to participate in a more cultural lunar new year than their typical. They live in america, and since moving here they just stay home for the holiday. It seems that they are very excited to go on this trip, and i want to show my appreciation in any way possible. There is a strong language barrier between us, we mostly only communicate through my husband. I am wondering, what are some possible gifts i can bring them to show them my appreciation? I have done my research, but as an outsider i do not want to overstep and i feel a little insecure about giving them traditional gifts. I need to know if this is just me. For example, would it be overstepping if i wore a red dress? Or would it excite them that i want to participate like that? Would i be weird if i brought them lucky flowers? Any insight at all would be very appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/rmn011  \n [link]   [comments]",

He used to celebrate pretty heavily with his immediate and extended family when he was younger, but the whole family has since stopped celebrating like they used to and I want to start up the celebrations again with him this year since I think it could be really nostalgic for him. I plan to decorate and cook, but what about gifts?\n I know that traditionally gifts of money are usually given to younger members of the family, so would it be weird if I got him a gift? I just really love gift giving and will look for any excuse to get him presents, but I don't want it to be weird if it seems inappropriate for this particular holiday. If it wouldn't be weird, what are some possible gift ideas that would be fitting? He really loves white tea, hates sweet things, and is always appreciative of plants if that helps.\n I remember him fondly reminiscing on the fun of red envelopes, and since it would be kind of awkward to give him money I had the idea of using the red envelopes to make a scavenger hunt for him. Thoughts on this idea? Too weird? Brutal honesty is appreciated, I'm still learning but it's hard to get an idea of what he would enjoy for Tet without spoiling the surprise of all my plans\n Thanks so much for any and all help!\n    submitted by    /u/FindThePants2019  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a seasoned backpacker and really wanting great food and culture (for context I'm from Melbourne), I will also be travelling with my mum for a period who's VERY Korean but want some nice experiences. Struggling to find a travel blog or anything online I'm really resonating so hoping this community can give me some insights. \n Food wise I would love street food, cool bars, places where locals eat and drink, areas where younger tourists go to socialise, where young locals go to socialise. \n Is it worth doing a few days elsewhere? \n Sorry, I know i'm asking a lot but any type of response will be gladly appreciated. Much love!\n    submitted by    /u/lj3394  \n [link]   [comments]",
