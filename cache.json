To me that doesn't sound like a great time, but I would like the social aspect that comes from a group. Does anyone have recommendations for a company that does tours of less than 10?

So I am not worried about loosing said property. Next question that I have is once money is in hand, in Vietnam, what is normally done/happens to transfer the title? Is it a red flag if a newly built condo does not have the red book,title? I was told that this is because the condo was recently built and at this time all units are not sold or finished yet. Though I do know that people have been living in that building for ả least 5 years. One would think that my in-laws would be able to answer these questions.

I am already prepared that i can’t cycle back on Sunday. I was thinking is it possible to bring a bicycle on a local bus back to Hanoi? I’ve taken the local bus 71 before also and it got quite full that time. I could also use a taxi but i heard it would cost over 1mil VND and im thinking what would be most convinient way.\n Thank you in advance! 😊\n    submitted by    /u/Nice_Satisfaction_53  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have proof of my flight back to Thailand, but will I need to buy my ticket from Thailand to the USA to get on my flight to Vietnam? If so can I get a flight that is 2 months after my reentry into Thailand? If not I may need to get a flight where I can adjust the dates later. Let me know your suggestions if this is required.

I currently live in Yosemite National Park as its only employee in a wheelchair, so I'm used to standards below what's technically legal in U.S. cities, and am used to having difficulty with transportation, groceries, etc. I have some specific questions, but in general I'd really appreciate some perspective from people with mobility impairments of any kind. Examples of commentary I'd find very useful:\n Do expats see many disabled people among middle class society?\n Are we treated differently in ways that are negative?\n Would I have a harder time getting or maintaining a job because of a visible disability? (Will I be discriminated against more than I already am in the U.S.?)\n Would it be difficult to find an apartment that's more or less accessible without it being considered a luxury or additional spending requirement?\n    submitted by    /u/Shadowrunner138  \n [link]   [comments]",

She says it's probably fine and she can talk to the desk and tell them she's actually my GF to smooth it over but won't research ahead of time for me which is frustrating since she's so confident this will work anywhere (internet tells me otherwise).\n I found some sites listing \"girl friendly\" hotels, but they all look pretty dumpy (what you'd expect for that crowd).\n Does anyone know any decent 4-star or so hotels in District 1 that would allow her? I've started to email some places in the meantime. Budget is around $75-150USD/night which should be plenty. I'd like to not stay in a rundown brothel which many of the places that allow guests seem to resemble.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/jaboober  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Perhaps it's just me, but this is the direct experience I've had whilst living in Hanoi for the last 4 months. I have my local vinmart, and another vinmart down the road and a circle k. I have to say, my experience of customer service has been the worst I have ever experienced. At the one store, the same girl (in her late 20's), just looks at me and has this look of contempt, of anger almost, grabs my items, scans them then points to the screen in a really 'I can't be bothered, hurry up' way. She grabs my card scans it, prints the receipt and just hands it to me, not even a smile, a nod, a goodbye, no eye contact. The other day she takes the basket and just throws it on the floor. Then again, tonight, the other store, I go in, the young man didn't say one word to me the entire time. No hello, no thank you, no goodbye (in Vietnamese.. I don't expect English)... And just slammed the receipt on the table and continued chatting. My question is, are these people taught by their companies to observe any form of customer service? Is it because they are shy? (even though they stare at me and even once sighed at me for taking too long to use my phone app to pay even though their card machine wasn't working)? Is it because they have no idea what to say to foreigners? Because I've been to other countries and a simple head nod, or even small gesture to acknowledge the customer and make him or her feel welcome isn't so difficult is it? Now I rather hate going shopping now. It is not an enjoyable situation and I'm wondering if anyone else has the same experience in Hanoi. As a customer spending money in these stores I feel entitled to some form of customer service. I dont expect much, but a simple xin Chào, cam on or even a smile to the foreigners who are living and working hard here (or even tourists spending their money here) isn't so difficult...

          "description": "I (21M) was born in 2001 in HCMC Vietnam and my mother's side originated from the HCMC region whilst my father's side originated from the North (he was born in Hanoi by the way). Even though both my parents, both my sisters (33F, 21F), and I have visited Hanoi several times, most of my mother's side has never visited North Vietnam yet (north of 17th parallel), despite the fact most of her relatives still live in Vietnam (from what I have heard from my mother, her side is quite wealthy and many of her relatives are business owners). Many of them only went around the Southern third of Vietnam and the furthest North many of them has visited is Nha Trang/Dalat. In fact, for all of my mother's relatives in the US (most came during the mid-late 1990s), none of them went above Nha Trang and half of them only visited Vietnam once or twice afterwards.\n Despite the fact I have only lived in Vietnam for 5 years before moving to Russia to study in 2006 and subsequently moving to the US at 11 in 2012, I have visited Vietnam several times afterwards (my most recent trip was in 2019 by the way), and I have visited the following places:\n Ca Mau, Can Tho, Long Xuyen, Ben Tre, Vung Tau, HCMC, Tay Ninh, Phan Thiet, Dalat, Nha Trang, Buon Ma Thuot, Tuy Hoa, Quy Nhon, Pleiku, Quang Ngai, Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Vinh, Thanh Hoa, Nam Dinh, Hanoi, Hai Duong, Haiphong, Ha Long, Thai Nguyen, Sapa\n ​\n  \nI am curious if it is common for Vietnamese people to have never visited the Northern half (North of 16/17 parallel)\n Plus, how common is it for Vietnamese Americans to never return to Vietnam or only return there once since moving to the US\n  \n   submitted by    /u/MussleGeeYem  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just want a jacket and pants, but if the price is good I could be convinced to get a shirt and/or vest too. I am thinking of choosing a charcoal wool/wool blend material.\n I am in my mid-20s but want it to be a versatile suit, so nothing either super vintage nor super modern; Regular length and medium-width notched lapels for the jacket and a slim-straight cut for the pants would be ideal. I also would like the suit to have some stretch, as I often get uncomfortable with the restrictive/stiff feel of store-bought suits.\n My budget would ideally be 5million VND, but a lot of talk online about this stuff is from pre-covid times, so I don't know if that is a realistic number. Please correct my expectations if they are unrealistic.\n What tailors would be appropriate for what I am looking for, and what prices can I expect? Also: do I need to buy the fabric separately on my own, or will that be included in the tailor bill? Or would it be cheaper to buy on my own? \n Any and all advice is much appreciated!

I’ve realised maybe 1 day is not enough for Tam Coc. Plus it’s a long journey from Tam Coc up to Ha Giang…\n After Tam Coc, the plan was to do the Ha Giang loop, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, however if we stay the extra day in Tam Coc, plus the long journey, I’m not sure we will have 4 days to do the loop. \n We have to be in Hai Phong Bay at 11:30am on Monday 10th for a trip to Cat Ba.\n So here is my question:\n Should we skip Tam Coc all together, get up to Ha Giang and just do the loop for as long as we can? Should we do the 2 days in Tam Coc and just do a smaller loop of Ha Giang? Should I stick to 1 day in Tam Coc and the 4 day loop of Ha Giang?\n It looks like if we decide to go to Tam Coc, we will have to get a night bus up to Ha Giang. And of course then another night bus from Ha Giang down to Hanoi. Lot of night travel - is it too much? Should we ease up and save stuff for another visit?\n Thanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/SintHollow  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tried to haggle the fine but in the end I left with 500k less in my pocket. \n Given that I am not going to be able to produce a valid licence since Im already here and my IDP has only a B stamp: Are there any tricks to avoid being stopped or prevent the fine at all?

I wasn't able to find much information other than for large film crews and as this is a school project where I and another classmate would be interviewing 2-3 locals I don't believe we fall into that category. The setup would be minimal with a tripod, camera, mic, and potentially a very small light if needed.

Around week 5, we are hoping to take a 5 day trip round the Ha giang loop, and I wanted to discuss the logistics of this here. A few notes:\n  \nneither of us have ridden a motorcycle/moped before, but are confident car drivers. We have access to a 100cc motorbike for practice\n both of our UK drivers licences cover \"AM\" vehicles (motorbikes smaller than 50cc) but to ride up to 175cc, we need an A1 licence\n we plan to rent motorbikes in the islands of Thailand earlier in our trip, and gauge whether we think it is feasible to carry out 5 days of driving.\n We will be doing the Ha Giang Loop in early May\n  \nI guess my biggest question is what are our options?\n Should we try to get an A1 licence before we go? (It only takes a day AFAIK so we should be able to sort it before the trip) if we bother doing this, will we be able to get an IDP that works? I've heard conflicting reports regarding the state of IDPs\n Should we go as we are? In this case we'll need to pay off police I'm sure which isn't a huge deal but I'd be worried about getting our bikes impounded, especially half way through the loop\n Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/quantThrowAway22  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm Muppi, I'm 25 years old, a photographer, and a filmmaker from the beautiful Lakshadweep Islands in India. I create cinematic content for businesses to use on their social media platform. I have 6 years of experience in social media content curation. My passion for filmmaking has taken me to many places. I have been traveling and volunteering around India, which has been a fulfilling experience. \n Where I grew up very connected to the sea, I grew up on the island life fixing boats, painting them and a lot of community works as apart of the local lifestyle there, as someone who loves nature and sustainability, I'm excited to travel outside of my country for the first time to put my skills to work for a meaningful cause. I'm passionate about balancing sports like slacklining, skateboarding, and surfing. I've spent a good amount of time sharing and teaching these skills. I'm also a documentary filmmaker and love to capture the beauty of nature and the stories of people who live in harmony with the environment.\n Few volunteering opportunities I did : - Helped a farmer for 3 months on his produce somewhere in the lush hills of western ghats in India. - Volunteered for an eco-festival in India to teach skating and help the festival crew. - Volunteered in the himalayas to help build a home-stay with a sustainable lifestyle. - Helped a few homestays and small businesses to provide quality content for their social media.\n Let's work together to make a positive impact while exploring a new culture!\n    submitted by    /u/Unable_Pumpkin6825  \n [link]   [comments]",

But, I would like to relate better to my background.\n For me, I associate the Vietnamese language and Vietnamese life with a lot of negativity. I think of Vietnamese people that are just really focused on money, friends who have issues with their parents, adults that are constantly yelling with each other, and people who just take out their insecurities on others because they want respect or validation,\n I haven't been able to have a lot of positive interactions and associations when it comes to being Viet. Viet life is just viewed as a source of turmoil to me sometimes.\n If you also feel this way about being Viet, please comment your emotions below.\n I know some people who have a good and healthy relationship to being Viet, but I'd consider them to be few. I'd really like to have a better relationship to being Viet, because I feel like a lot of us hate ourselves. Historically, it looks like a lot of us have just wanted to attach ourselves to other larger empires, such as China, France, or America. And, that makes me kinda sad. \n The few people that I know that have a positive relationship to being Vietnamese come from good, healthy families.

          "description": "We are traveling through Vietnam in April and will be on Phu Quoc for a few days towards the end of our trip. To compensate our daughter a bit for all the walking and looking at things, we had considered visiting the Aquatopia water park. As we know by now, the free shuttle bus has been discontinued, but we found out that the public bus #11 (which also runs from the airport) goes close enough to the cable car station. Only unfortunately it seems that the bus is also no longer running, at least I can't find any information about it on the net (not even on the airport page). Has anyone ridden the bus lately or knows that it no longer exists? If it runs, we would look for a hotel along the bus line, otherwise we go, as actually planned, to Ong Lang and forget the thing with the park simply (I have no desire to pay 60€ for cabs to Cable Station and back, then we rather invest the money in as much ice cream as she can eat...). Or are there any other public busses, preferably from/to the Ong Lang area?\n    submitted by    /u/Erft  \n [link]   [comments]",

We all know and love Pho and Banh Mi, but there's so much more to the Vietnamese breakfast scene that often goes unnoticed. Recently, I've discovered a lesser-known but absolutely mouthwatering dish: Banh Cuon Cao Bang! 😋\n For those who haven't tried it yet, Banh Cuon Cao Bang is a delicate and savory rice noodle roll filled with minced pork, wood ear mushrooms, and shallots. It's usually served with a side of fresh herbs, cucumber, and a tasty dipping sauce. It has quickly become my go-to breakfast choice, and I'm eager to find more dishes like this!\n So, fellow foodies, I'm asking you: What are your favorite Vietnamese breakfasts, particularly the lesser-known ones? Let's uncover some hidden culinary gems together and share our love for Vietnamese cuisine. Please share your favorites and any stories or memories you have associated with them. If you have any secret spots or recipes, feel free to share as well!\n Looking forward to reading your responses and expanding my breakfast horizons! 🍽️\n Cheers and happy eating! 🥢\n    submitted by    /u/DragonXDT  \n [link]   [comments]",

People over at r/coffee tend to be pour-over and aeropress guys so I don't read much about other brewing methods there. That's why I decided to ask here. :)\n Any tips on getting the best brew? I personally haven't tweaked much from what I usually do these past months when I first had a phin: Grind 14g of beans using setting 3 (medium fine) for my 6 click cheapo grinder that I bought over at Shopee, preheat the brewer and the glass, dump the grounds on the brewing chamber and shake to level, drop the press filter and press a bit (this one I'm not sure if necessary), pour hot-off-the-boil water about twice the volume of the coffee into the chamber to bloom the grounds and wait for 30 seconds, pour water to the brim of the chamber, then cover to retain the heat. Drip finishes at around 6 mins.\n I usually make coffee via pour-over and I love the different nuances in the process and how each factor affects the output of the brew, But I love the simplicity of the Phin and how no non-sense it is -it's brute force coffee.\n Also, what should I look for if I want to buy a better Phin filter? And if you are a Timemore C2 user, what is your current grind setting?\n I would love to hear from you guys. :) Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Bibingka_Malagkit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think we then said let’s do it this year but that was also bad and realistically my family couldn’t make it to Vietnam this year. However, we didn’t want to wait until 2025. So after some consultation with a pháp sư her mum said this year was ok and we will have ancestor welcoming (me?) into the family this year on the day of our legal marriage abroad and the wedding ceremony in Vietnam next year, but since it’s unlucky we are just having a “party” not a wedding ceremony.

It’s always in passing that we exchange words. I’m white and don’t know much about Vietnamese culture or customs, so I’m not sure exactly how to approach them for fear of accidentally coming off as rude or ignorant. I love my boyfriend a lot, and I go to his house and see them pretty often. He doesn’t have a very close relationship with his family, and even they don’t talk much outside of them asking if he’s eaten or where he is, so I’m not sure if he’d be able to help me here. It means a lot to me, having them like me, as I see us having a long future together. Does anyone have any tips or things I should know/necessary knowledge like what is or is not respectful?

The Southern Chams in the Mekong Delta have largely adhered to Sunni Islam and they are the only ethnic group in Vietnam to be Muslims.\n The third Cham group, however, practise a complex religion called \"Bani\". It was thought to be traced from Persian traders (Persia/Iran was converted to Shia Islam by Shah Ismail I), who spread their Shia Islam to the community during the Vietnamese shogunates (Trinh-Nguyen). However, Bani is unique that it is so synchronised with other religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and even Han and Kinh (Vietnamese) people's folk traditions that it lost most of the original Islamic belief.\n The Bani community is small today but their religious practise has ignited discussions. Some groups believed that they are actually Muslims but with a different characteristic. But some other (including many Banis) disagree with the classification of Bani as a separate Shia Islam sect and instead insist that they are Banis and not Muslims. There is a 2006 documentary called \"A Strange Islam\" by Agnes De Feo about this community, which put their existence to spotlight.\n Question here is, are Bani people Shia Muslims or just Banis? And what kind of religion Bani is?\n    submitted by    /u/JoJo-Bizarre-1997  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: My experience in Vietnam is a treasure on my heart. \n (Rant)I spent time there a few years back. An American in your beautiful country. I think of the smells, the people, the beauty, and the food. Your kindness to me and my travel mate was second to none, from the south to the north. I know it may be required of your culture to be \"nice\" when you really want to say what needs to be said, but I saw a humble care of the world in which the Vietnamese live, which includes naive tourists. Always kind to me, which I am not used to.\n As an American, I am so thankful for your hospitality. From my perspective, I would have so much animosity towards people like me. Maybe you keep it to yourselves. Or maybe, you just want to move on. A humble strength in family and kindess. \n Vietnam is one of my fondest memories. I treasure it. I spent a night on a boat in Ha Long Bay. Although I was drunk and silly, the crew invited me and my girlfriend to the kitchen. Vietnamese food and a strange, ridiculously strong sangria. One of the greatest experiences in my life. It was like 345 in the morning!\n I got to sleep in. And the crew, who I think several were celebrating birthdays, were up at like 5! Being hungover on a boat while working sounds impossible. They did it, cause they had to. Tourism is likely the (I don't know) biggest money makers for Vietnam these days I imagine.\n My last night, I got a tattoo on my inner left forearm in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh). I hear that many people tired of their tattoos when they see them everyday. For me? I wax nostalgic and think of how amazing Vietnam was. How it is. And how it treated me and my friend. \n Not only do I have a great experience. But the people of Vietnam make me want to be a better person. I try everyday. Be humble. Be kind. Make good pho. Regrettably, the latter tastes like salty water. I'll keep trying.\n I miss Vietnam. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/PeterCushingsTriad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry if this is not an appropriate place to post this, but I wasn’t sure what other subreddit to post this to.\n I met a Vietnamese guy on a tour last year in South America. We stayed in touch and when I went over to Thailand, we decided to meet up there. I’ve noticed that he is not that polite to hotel and restaurant staff as well as drivers. For example, he doesn’t say thank you when staff brings his drink or food to the table ever. He doesn’t say thank you when we are leaving the restaurant and they are saying thank you and goodbye. He’s not mean to them or anything, he simply ignores them. We hired a driver and instead of walking a few meters to meet the driver, he insisted the driver come into a very tight spot even though it was super inconvenient for the driver to have to back out. I tried to tell him we can just walk up to a more convenient spot and he said no, that we are paying the guy so we will wait for him to come to us.\n I’m wondering if this is just a cultural thing? I am ethnically Vietnamese, however I grew up in the US and my attitude is completely different (I’ve also worked in the hospitality industry so maybe I’m hypersensitive to this). I grew up being taught to be extra nice to hospitality workers because they work very hard but make very little. I get a sense from him that he sees them as beneath them.

          "description": "Serious question here. Why do so many Vietnamese burn garbage? Outside of the traffic situation, burning of things and the resulting air pollution it causes is without a doubt the most negative aspect of this amazing country. I don’t get it as everything I have seen on fire could have easily been put on virtually any curb for pickup by the garbage crews at least in the cities where smoke impacts a lot of people. \n It makes me so mad as it not only affects my health, but more so, that of babies and children who are more vulnerable plus ALL of you who live here. Why is this not something the government is cracking down on as the trickle down health effects surely are taking a toll on the nation...even just cognatively as it effects your brain too. Plus, who wants to constantly be getting whiffs of burning plastics and whatnot on the daily? It is 2023 and we KNOW better, so why the ignorance in this particular area here? \n If you burn things on the regular basis…why? Can you please shed some light as to your motivations? \n From Wikipedia:\n “The World Health Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.[6] Studies published in March 2019 indicated that the number may be around 8.8 million.[127] A 2022 review concluded that air pollution was responsible for 6.67 (5.90–7.49) million premature deaths in 2019. It concluded that since 2015 little real progress against (superordinate) pollution, which remained at ~9 million earlier deaths, can be identified.[128][19]00090-0-19) Causes of deaths include strokes, heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections.[6]\"\n    submitted by    /u/immersive-matthew  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hoping someone has some experience on what may be the best approach. For my last two days in Vietnam, I'm struggling to decide on two different scenarios. I'm not deterred by long days and aim to do as much as I can. I've heard Ha Long Bay is more touristy, so I'd like to avoid that if possible. But here are what I've found to be the best scenarios - so if there are other options that I am not thinking of, please share!\n Option One: Day trip excursion from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay. Lasts ~12 hours and allows me to book another one day excursion from Hanoi for the second day. I feel like this will result in roughly 6 hours total of travel back and forth for each day, so seems like I am not getting the most out of my days. But, may allow me to see something else I haven't considered for a day trip.\n Option Two: Depart early AM via train or bus to Cat Ba Island, arriving midday. This allows some brief exploration of Cat Ba National Park. However, the following day it is unclear to be me if I can actually see Lan Hay Bay. I will be leaving out of Hanoi at 2300hrs that night, so need to be back to the airport around 2000hrs. It looks like my options to get back to mainland are to ferry at 1530hrs (ending my day prematurely) or at 1730hrs (getting back too late). Would it even be possible for me to see Lan Ha Bay in this time? The only thing I've found only is departing from 0800 and not arriving back to the island until 1500, which means my only option would be to take the ferry back at 1730. I'd like to make this option work, if I can, to see the mostt of the island but looks like the timing doesn't quite work :(\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Triggerboom0306  \n [link]   [comments]",

While Hanoi was amazing, I couldn't wait to get out of the city and immerse myself in the beautiful nature of this country.\n But my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I arrived at Ha Long Bay. The pictures I saw online were nothing like the reality I experienced. It was crowded with tourists and heavily commercialized.

I am 32 years old, originally from Germany. I have BA degree in Southeast Asian and American Studies. I am considering to do a second degree in Tourism/Hotel-Management at an online university in order to be able to work while studying. \n My overall CV has a lot of \"holes\" in it, because in my 20s I spent quit a fair amount of time traveling around the globe. I worked seven years as a freelance journalists with a main emphasis on tourism; had countless jobs in restaurants; worked for a company specialized in book trade; and, more recently, been employed as a social worker at a school in Germany. I also have my own little side hustle going on, selling records/cds/cassettes. In addition, I speak Indonesian and Malay, and I am currently trying to advance my Vietnamese language skills. \n In the near and distant future, I'd like to live and work in Da Nang. I spent a fair amount of time in the city in the recent decade, and I feel very much at home there. My girlfriend lives in Da Nang, too, and we are in committed long term relationship. Therefore, I am considering to find a suitable occupation for myself in the city, and I can picture myself doing a good job in the tourism sector. Online, though, I can barely find any job ads. \n I'd be very grateful if anyone could give me some honest feedback if I'd be able to get a work permit in the tourism sector in Da Nang with my background; and if so, I'd appreciate any tips on what to keep in mind, what to be careful about, and so forth. \n Thank you so much in advance! =)\n    submitted by    /u/bluebirdlarry  \n [link]   [comments]",

They seem to have a lot of fun amongst each other, especially the babies. About 30 minutes of watching them they have decided to leave the tree and go further. Male Gibbon went directly above us and let it rip, the poop showered us, my camera, clothes, and my girlfriends clothes. Anyone got similar experience with Gibbons? Our guide told us this never happened on his treks, so I'm just wondering.

It seems that the rapid urbanization and economic growth in recent years have led to a boom in real estate development, but sadly, this has come with a slew of negative consequences.\n To start with, the infrastructure in cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City is severely lacking and has not kept pace with the construction of these massive apartment complexes.

We do have a flight out of a Hanoi to Tokyo planned in about 6 days.\n Since we were unable to travel on our flight to Vietnam, we are opting to get an emergency passport as the US consulate in Thailand.\n After receiving an emergency passport, would we have any issues trying to fly to Hanoi so we can transfer and get to Tokyo on our flight?\n    submitted by    /u/adamj495  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lmao? Not to mention all the Chinese movies and shows that were sponsored and sanctioned by the State and their money, are all over the Vietnamese TVs. \n Those that know will boycott the movie, the average people dont know shit and will watch it. And watching it doesnt mean you support Donnie Yen’s view … and since the economy is going through a recession, the movie industry is dwindling, the International Court of Arbitration denied the 9 dash line’s legitimacy… why not show it, scrapping some billions VND while at it. \n Sorry for the rant.\n    submitted by    /u/Mackey_Nguyen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lúc mình chen vào giữa 2 chiếc ô tô (1 đen, 1 trắng)thì khoảng trống giữa 2 xe nhỏ lại do chiếc xe trắng chạy áp sát vào. Mình thấy vậy nên rồ ga vượt qua và tông cong kính chiếu hậu xe trắng. Do hoảng và xe đông nên mình không biết dừng xe ở đâu để giải quyết rồi rồ ga bỏ đi. Mọi người có thể cho mình xin lời khuyên được không ạ?

The mutt bit me on the finger and I had to go for 5 rabies shots.\n It was a harrowing welcome to Vietnam, let's just say that!\n I've been chased by a couple aggressive dogs since that, and seen some wild looking dogs just roaming the streets that I don't want anything to do with. \n I refuse to pet or put myself in any sort of vulnerable position even with friendly dogs. \n I grew up with pet dogs in the west. To say I'm a dog lover is an understatement. I miss my family's dog so much while I'm here. \n I never would have thought that I would develop a fear of dogs, but I feel it growing every time I have to walk past an unknown dog on the street. \n Rabies scares me more than the dogs to be honest... \n Luckily the family dog didn't have rabies and is still alive. But 5 shots is really annoying to schedule around. Pretty cool they are only $2 though.\n    submitted by    /u/FoxResponsible4790  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the masseuse refused and so I pulled out a 100k note and she took it and then pointed at the 50k to give to her as well. I don't speak any vietnamese so I just gave it to her as well. Was I ripped off? 50% tip is a little too much imo 😅 I just considered it foreigner tax and won't be going back to that place lol\n Edit: This thread has been polarizing. And for the record it was just a normal 90 minute massage. No extras. And if I'm being honest the massage was not good either. The lady was inconsistent on where to apply pressure and did not do so equally on both sides and just massaged wherever. The place was nice and situated in a somewhat affluent neighborhood so I expected something better.\n    submitted by    /u/vlbonite  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am very time restricted and only have 12 full days to complete this ride. Is it possible to do this? Am I an idiot for even considering this? Will I make it in time considering weather etc? I am a very experienced rider, so riding in the rain does not bother me, but will floods and such stop me? Any recommendations or considerations would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/touchmaspot  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I hope you're all doing well. \n I am used to solo traveling, and sometimes I schedule solo trips for my birthday to celebrate it on a different way. Every time I did this I had an amazing time with the people I met randomly during the trips! \n This year I've chosen to do this in Vietnam and I was thinking on spending this day on a 2-days cruise to Ha Long Bay. My other options are Hanoi itself or maybe Da Nang. I am, however, scared that these cruises are full of closed groups or families and I end up having a not-so-pleasant experience. \n For those who did this already, what do you think? Is there any other alternative you strongly suggest? Side note: turning 33. \n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/every90sanime  \n [link]   [comments]",

To get it, he needs to renounce the Vietnamese citizenship but he told me that it can be a very long and difficult process. Does anyone have experience with it? Is it really that difficult?\n Another thing - he has not done the military training and is not planning to as he wants to spend his life in Latvia. But he has to go to Vietnam this summer to renew his ID. I'm worried he might get into trouble for avoiding the training so I'm quite worried about him going there.

          "description": "My wife is from Vietnam but has been living in the US for 8 years. Her parents have been living here longer, and no longer have any Vietnamese citizenship papers. The question concerns them.\n Due to circumstances they put their properties in the name of a relative who still lives in Vietnam, but now they wish to change that. Because they no longer have their citizenship papers, and it takes a long time to get them again, they cannot put the properties in their names. What sort of options do they have?\n I was wondering if there was a kind of trust they could use to own the property, but have the trust be controlled by them, or, at the very least, have it be controlled by a relative still in Vietnam, but with their name attached in some way that requires their consent for anything to be done to the property. They are old and probably too trusting, I want to see if there is any way we can help protect their interests as well as possible. They said they already spoke to an attorney, but I am not sure they spoke to the right kind or asked the right questions.\n Any help is appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/clutchheimer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mình đang ở canada theo diện work permit nên sẽ có 3 năm để làm việc và cũng như cơ hội để kiếm thẻ xanh ở đây. Nhưng mà hiện tại thì em cảm thấy rất muốn về VN để sinh sống và làm việc cũng như được ở gần gia đình và bạn bè hơn. Nên mình dự tính là vẫn sẽ ở canada làm việc 2-3 năm để có thêm kinh nghiệm (và bằng CPA ). Mình chỉ đang thắc mắc là nếu trường hợp mình như vậy thì về vn có ổn không ạ? Và vấn đề lương thì mọi người thấy như thế nào? Mình thật sự rất cần lời khuyên ngay lúc này vì mình cảm thấy rất nhớ Việt Nam. Nếu quyết định về VN thì mình nghĩ lương sẽ không thể nào bằng được như ở CA được, nhưng mình nghĩ mình sẽ thoải mái hơn vì được gần gia đình và bạn bè và cũng như được ăn những món mình thích hoặc buồn thì cứ xách xe lên mà đi 1 vòng thôi. Nhưng nếu lương không ổn thì cũng hơi stress 1 tí. \n Cho mình cảm ơn mọi người nhiều.\n Hi everyone. I have just graduated from the university majoring in accounting and currently working as an accountant in Big4. I am in Canada on a work permit so I will have 3 years to work as well as the opportunity to apply for a green card.

I’m planning to stay in Canada to work for 2-3 years to gain more experience (and getting CPA). Is ok to go back to Vietnam after that? And what about the salary expectation? I really need some advices right now because I miss Vietnam so much. If I do decide to return to Vietnam, I don't think the salary will be as good as compared to CA, but I think I will be happier since I can be closer family and friends .\n Thank you and I really appreciate any advices/ suggestions/ inputs.\n    submitted by    /u/According-Growth3654  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm currently in Southeast Asia and will be arriving in Vietnam in late April. I originally planned to do the motorbike loop in Ha Giang independently on rented bikes, but that was before I learned about needing a motorcycle license. I don't want to risk my insurance being void, so that's out of the question now. \n I was pretty set on doing it independently without a company, so this threw a real wrench in my plan. I've already decided to skip travelling to Northern Thailand because of burning season, so I know I'll be back to the area, so my question is whether I should wait until I have a motorcycle license and do it later in life, or just suck it up and do it with an easy rider. \n The reason I'm posting is just to hear how it went for other people. I don't love not being in control of my own bike, I'm somewhat introverted so the social aspect isn't huge, I like being able to stop and check out little shops or side roads, and I'm concerned with a bigger group that I won't be able to do this. I don't really have the money to do a private tour, and even doing it with an easy rider is putting a bit of a stretch on my budget. \n Overall though, I'm wondering if I should still just do it. I suppose I'm just looking for stories of how people felt using easy riders and whether they felt like they would have had a better time doing it solo. The loop was the one thing I wanted to do the most out of Southeast Asia, but I'm wondering if I should just do it later when I can fully enjoy it. \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/makeshiftswift  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! Looking for some advice - let me know if this isn’t the right place. Friend and I are planning to ride 110cc bikes from north to south, weaving from mountains to coast in April/May. \n We are fully licensed to ride motorcycles in the US and have been riding for years. Fully understand that riding there is different and we take that seriously. Would be wearing protective gear and staying off the roads that don’t allow bikes. The US IDP provided by AAA lists Vietnam as “not party to the 1949 convention but honors IDP”. This is a little confusing as Vietnam did sign the Geneva convention in 1953. So while we aren’t terribly worried about being allowed to do this, we are having trouble finding medical insurance coverage since there doesn’t appear to be any laws that explicitly say US citizens can rent or drive any type or vehicle there. We’ve read about certain companies that would provide medical coverage anyway as long as you are licensed and qualified in your home country but haven’t found one yet.\n Is anyone aware of a way we can do this? Or any companies that expats or travelers have used successfully recently? I’m not willing to ride without medical coverage so I would need to travel by other means or go somewhere else. This is a trip I’ve been thinking of doing for years - I’d be extremely bummed to have to see this beautiful country out a train window and not be able to experience the smaller mountain communities along the journey (I’d also need to do the trip alone in this case). Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/dvt37283  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Spent 9 days traveling in Vietnam. Started from Hoi An and kept moving to Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, and ended at Ho Chi Minh. Used different modes of transport, met tons of people, and experienced things that I'm truly grateful for.\n My experiences helped me break a lot of stereotypes and prejudices that were told to me before my visit. Vietnam is not a country for cheap shopping or fake stuff or weird food. it's not a country where people will con you or misguide you. It's not a country that is rude, indifferent, or selfish.\n After 9 days in Vietnam, I'm taking back memories of meeting kind locals who go out of their way to help you, friendly shopkeepers who give you a small sovenieur as good luck because you made them smile while bargaining, helpful grab drivers who gave you a genuine smile just because you bowed and offered with money with both hands, Bar tenders and staff, who booked grab for me and offered a free drink just because i was nice to them. At every situation I got stuck or lost, I was given direction by locals who didn't have to give a fuck about me. After traveling many places in the world, I sincerely believe that if tourists remove their stereotypical blindfolds, they can experience a truly beautiful country I.e. Vietnam. ❤️ And that's what I'm taking back to India with me.\n P.S: I would like to offer my hospitality if anyone is planning to travel to India, especially Mumbai.

I know it’s hopeless, but maybe someone here has some advice lol\n My grandmother’s grandmother is from Huế, my grandmother’s family is from Tra Vinh, where we went to a family graveyard when we went to Vietnam for the first time this summer. We were able to come there since our family still has contact with Hmong people (?) that used to work for the family who own it now. It had the graves of many family members except one, my grandmother’s grandmother: Nguyễn Thị Điệm (born ca. 1880). Although there was a picture of her with her date of death: 20 Aug 1916. My grandmother told me that she was buried in Huế with her family, and that her brother who now lives in the US visited the grave in 2000 via contact with the gravekeepers, although she has not had contact with him for a long time, and does not seem very keen on doing it either. Apparently her brother (my greatuncle) is also not that bright due to his years in the camp.\n The family was apparently very rich, and were according to my family close to the emperor, I know nothing else except that Nguyễn Thị Điệm’s brother was a very prestigious or conceited photographer.\n I know its probably hopeless, but does anyone maybe have any advice on how i should find (how to contact) the graveyard (owners)?

He asks me to show him around when we meet in Hanoi. I was kinda passive in the relationships with other Vietnamese boyfriends before, like they picked me up to dating locations. Thus, I don’t know how to take the lead in dating with an expat in Hanoi. Which type of transportation used when we date? I don’t have car driving license. Pick him up by a motorbike I drive is bit weird, isn’t it? Have you been in this situation? Plz share your experience. Kindly introduce me some places that expats want to hangout in Hanoi. We are both in twenties. Much appreciated!\n Edit: Thank so much for your advice. Most of them are very helpful. I am way too overthinking. I was worried about the size difference if I drive him on a bike, im like 5’1 feet while he is 6’2 feet. But, I will ask him what he wants to choose bike or cab although bike is the my most preferred transport when hanging out in Hanoi. To whom who may wish me luck with green card: he is not even a Western. He is my Hindu colleague. We hit it off and accept a long distance relationship. That’s it. Now Vietnamese girls don’t date expats for money. We can be both cute and rich at the same time. Get used to it.\n    submitted by    /u/Ab6_Idk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey Community,\n I'm in Da Nang for the next 7 weeks and love it so far. But still did not meet any local women, which I obviously wouldn't mind. I would like to go out tomorrow night, I don't mind going solo. And then, I am usually not afraid to talk with a women if there seems to be an ''opening''. I value a good friendship, and nice communication / talk, even if nothings happens afterwards. It's really mostly about meeting local people/women and ''why not if more''.\n What would be the best nightclubs to easily meet local people who are more likely to be ''into foreigners'' (I am in my thirties, very healthy and tall, I think I can be doing ok) and more likely to be able to talk a bit or good English ? Avoiding places full of ''pro's'' and full of Koreans could be a good thing I imagine :D (but I imagine it's not always avoidable).\n Thanks in advance !\n    submitted by    /u/K1ll4rmy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Two years ago I was constantly seeing stories about how Vietnam had the highest economic growth in Southeast Asia. Was getting massively invested in by Japan and Korea, and had tons of companies relocating to it from China during the Sino-American trade war. Many YouTubers I was watch on the ground said they could see the explosive growth year by year as it felt like the early days of China as it was beginning to achieve great economic success. The everyday life was becoming tangibly better year by year.\n But I checked in again recently, and I saw the GDP growth has massively faltered the past two years, and also saw that the previous economics minded president has seemingly been replaced by a more politics minded one.\n So I was just wondering, does Vietnam still seem to be on track for explosive growth and this is just a short break because of COVID or is the growth really slowing down?

When I look the price up its 5M Dong a night. 5M Dong. \n How do these luxury hotels even survive? Why they don’t lower the price?\n It seems like the hotel owners are so crazy rich they don’t care about some losses and don’t want to lower the prices to not lose image or something. (imagine you pay $200 for a hotel and some months later it’s $100 a night because of low demand. in Europe or also in Thailand, hotels dgaf and just lower the price to get at least some customers, but here it’s not like that). Or?? I can’t understand it pls explain me guys\n Also this Vin Grand World has sooo many restaurants and stuff with expensive food, but most of them are completely empty because it’s too expensive when you could get outside the same food for much lower price. \n It seems like the “market” with demand offer etc doesn’t really work for these giants they just dgaf about losses, or is there some bigger story behind that? I also remember how people in this sub once talked how expensive vinfast cars became or smth like that\n    submitted by    /u/pizzavegano  \n [link]   [comments]",
