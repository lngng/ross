          "description": "We have been staying in Hanoi for a week already and we are staying the next three weeks. We’ve been getting by using google translate and common sense and so far he’s tried a wide variety of Vietnamese food without a reaction. Seems like a lot of food uses soy oil so far. He carries epi pens with him.\n However, people are often confused by the translated message and we think it’s not clear. \n Using google translate from English to viet to English, “no nuts, no sesame” returns as “no seeds. Unseasoned” which isn’t helpful at all hahaha.\n Also nuts can translate to peanuts but he is allergic to all nuts and nut oils. Sesame also seems to have multiple translations.\n A translation of something like “I can’t eat nuts, nut oils, sesame, sesame oil. Does this food contain them?” would be ideal! :D \n thank you for any help!!\n Edit If you’re interested hes only eating a small bite of food then waiting 5-10 mins for a reaction to be safe. if he reacted he would make himself throw it up. He also has tablets and 4 epi pens. He’s also a med student.\n    submitted by    /u/Professional_Food429  \n [link]   [comments]",

Packing super light and will have just a large backpack with me.\n I'm planning on flying into Ho Chi Minh city, spending a couple of nights, then I want to make the trek up to Hanoi. Does anyone have suggestions on how to do this, and what the most interesting path might be? Also is it safe to travel alone or are there some sketchy parts I should avoid?\n Ideally I'd love to rent a motorcycle and ride up myself... but I've never ridden a motorcycle or driven in Asia so scratch that idea. Is there some kind of boat I can take, or something? I'd love to make my way up to Hanoi over the course of 5-6 days and see as much of Vietnam as I can.\n Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/CEO_VandalayInc  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’ve been dating for over six months and the relationship has gotten serious.\n I love him (surprisingly, his family also loves me) and it’s looking like things might end in marriage down the line. I’m amazed they accept me so easily when my family doesn’t accept him, but I try my best anyway. His family wants everyone to live together someday soon. My boyfriend says no.\n My boyfriend has a rebellious spirit. His cousin bought me VN government-issued textbooks to study the language, but he doesn’t want to teach me Vietnamese manners. It leads to awkward situations with his family A LOT. He says “just be yourself, it’s America!” but I want his family’s approval.\n His parents were very poor in VN and are very traditional. My family is rich and has more advanced manners than average Americans. I grew up with my grandparents too, so I act and dress more like an older lady. It’s funny because sometimes I act like a polite American to his parents and they say to my boyfriend “she has Vietnamese manners, nice”. I’m totally uneducated but I know I offend them a little sometimes. \n For example, he didn’t tell me I should offer his parents to eat before I eat their food. Things like that. \n Please, if anyone has information on how not to offend Vietnamese parents, tell me. I never dress provocatively or curse, and I try to be as helpful as possible in the kitchen. My boyfriend’s family gives me a lot of patience as a westerner, but I want to do the right thing.\n Thank you 💗\n    submitted by    /u/Impossible_Biscotti3  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just left Vietnam last year for my study, after 32 years living in the country, Ho Chi Minh City to be specific. I had always felt “un-belonged” before whilst living in HCMC, and the biggest reason is because. I am very independent, in almost everything, mentality, finance, living style etc. I own what I say, and do. I have a big extended family with 10 uncles and aunties, and a small immediate family with a single mom and a big older brother (we are 18 years old apart). I grew up without a father, and he’s around somewhere in this country, just not around in any form. My family is very respectful, and I am very proud of them.

Have been using a dating app here. I noticed there are some girls on the app who are very eager to meet right away and go for a drink. Stupidly, I agreed to go with one this evening.\n She told me to meet her around the corner from Sniff club. Met her, looked nothing like her photos (which hardly showed her face anyway). She led us to this club.\n She didn’t even speak English and we communicated via google translate…\n She said she wanted to drink champagne 🤦🏼‍♂️ so I bought a bottle. Then she asked if she can do some balloons, and kept asking for more and more. At one point she suggested I tip the bar staff. \n She was super flirty and touching me all over. Until I said no to more balloons she acted like a grumpy child.\n I noticed some girls who were waiting on the corner, who later on were in the same club with some foreigner men.\n I am quite sure these girls are employed by the club to get men to come in and spend money. My total bill was 5 million…\n It’s a sad feeling to be taken advantage of like this.

          "description": "In a particular marketing team, there is a supervisor who holds the same number of years of work experience as the other team members but demonstrates less competence. It is evident to everyone in the office that the supervisor is the CEO's favorite employee. Whenever the CEO makes an insensitive joke, if the supervisor reacts poorly, the CEO apologizes. However, if anyone else in the team reacts negatively, the CEO calls them out, expressing dissatisfaction with their response.\n Interestingly, it was the supervisor who recently fired a colleague, but the CEO publicly supported the decision, attributing it to himself. This situation suggests that the CEO is protecting the supervisor by taking responsibility for the dismissal. This lack of transparency creates an unbalanced power dynamic within the office. After the incident, the office became dull.\n Moreover, the supervisor constantly seeks to know what others are doing, including questioning their work methods. This behavior can be bothersome, especially when team members are competent and experienced. For instance, one team member was surprised when the supervisor asked for assistance with a basic marketing task, such as scheduling social media posts. It is disconcerting when someone in an executive role lacks knowledge of fundamental marketing tools.\n These observations raise my concerns about power dynamics within the team. The supervisor appears to be favored, even with her limited competence, while others are held to a different standard. Additionally, the CEO's protection of the supervisor and the supervisor's micromanagement tendencies suggest an abuse of power. \n    submitted by    /u/DelusionalBroccoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

I saw so many people (young and old) simply throwing their trash onto the street: people eating chips and dropping the bag in the sidewalk, a man putting deodorant and tossing it to the middle of the road, plastic bottles, bags, cans of drinks… basically litter everywhere. \n This is particularly disturbing in big cities like Hanoi and Saigon, which are apparently developed and everyone has a phone and internet, but no one seems to have environmental awareness about reducing and recycling their waste.\n I can understand that old habits die hard and older people continue doing that, but the younger ones seem to follow that path as well. \n Also, the amount of plastic is insane. Is there really a need to get a drink in a plastic cup, inside a plastic bag, sealed with a plastic lid and drink it from a plastic straw? Even if you drink it on the spot and not take away, they will still put the plastic lid with a machine. On top of that, after finishing the drink, all that plastic ends up being dumped on the street.\n I’m no environmental “freak” or entitled European, but I’m genuinely curious if this is an issue being addressed by Vietnamese people (in schools, public campaigns) or if they simply don’t care.

          "description": "Good Morning All,\n I am an American and I live permanently in Viet Nam with my wife who is Vietnamese.\n I have lived in Viet Nam for 10 years now and we recently moved here to live a more simpler life. However, I've been thinking about opening up my own business as I have extensive experience in my field and I feel quite confident I can make it work well.\n My question is what is the least hassle-free way of doing this. I have zero problem putting the business 100% into my wife's name if it means less issues.\n Would this be the recommended course of action? If so, is anyone aware of the fees or capital requirements for a 100% Vietnamese owner versus a foreigner owner? Anything else that might be worth taking into consideration?\n I'm not trying to shortcut any taxes or anything like that. I have no problem paying my fair share. I'm just trying to get everything started as cost-effectively as possible.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/phertick85  \n [link]   [comments]",

Has anyone done this recently? Should I just go back to Hanoi and fly to Hue and simply suck up the waste of a day? \n Also, is the 'rainy season' in Hue/Hoi An in mid-October absolutely awful or usually ok for tourist activities?

          "description": "Out of curiosity, from those who have experienced any of these how effective does everyone think these following traditions are?: - Wind snatching (Dật gió) - Wind scraping (Cạo gió) - Cupping (Giác hơi) - Acupressure (Bấm Huyệt) - Bloodletting (Cắt llể)\n Do they actually help with what they intend to do (e.g reduce pain/stiffness, cure diseases, improve skin or health etc.) or are they mainly placebo from your experience?\n Context if you’re curious: I’ve lived in Australia my whole life and an currently in Vietnam to visit family after a long time. My family is very insistent on using traditional medicine techniques to improve my skin. They took me to a doctor who put small cuts on my skin all over my body, and when I searched this up I got the term ‘Cắt llể’ for bloodletting. They’ve been doing this almost more than weekly and they say that it’s getting all the bad blood out. In my opinion it’s a real pain and honestly I doubt it’s doing anything. But maybe it works for others?\n I’ve been provided wind scraping before with my family using the green eagle medicine and they said that the redder it is the more sick I am. It’s probably very red because of how hard they scrape it into my skin! It definitely helps warm you up though.\n I’m just wondering how this all is for both people who have lived in vietnam and how normal it all is.

Từ lúc đó mình có suy nghĩ là mình muốn về Việt Nam làm việc và sinh sống. 1 phần cũng là vì để ở gần ba mẹ và ông mình, 1 phần là muốn tiềm hiểu thêm về ngành Supply Chain ở Việt Nam và mở rộng network và 1 phần nữa là tận hưởng những năm tháng thanh xuân mà mình đã bõ lỡ.

Any ideas on what should I search for / recommendations? Thanks in advance 😀\n    submitted by    /u/DeLannoy04  \n [link]   [comments]",

We've been going to cafe's, weekend trips across my state, to local events like the show grounds and have an intimate relationship. However she refuses to call me boyfriend, even when strangers ask she clarifies I'm only \"her friend\" or \"her neighbour\". When challenged she says she's still deciding whether I'm a good person.\n At the same time she wants me to fly to her home city with her at the end of the year. And all her friends and colleagues from work say she talks about me often.\n Is this a cultural difference? Are women from Vietnam always so hesitant to call someone boyfriend?\n    submitted by    /u/mink6  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m also Southeast Asian (Philippines), but the food here hits differently. \n It’s always perfectly balanced. Flavors aren’t aggressive, yet the food is very flavorful. The servings are always just right. The food is filling, but not heavy on the belly. It’s literally perfect for me. \n I only stayed in Hanoi and Saigon, but I had the most fun just eating, interacting with locals and travelers, and people-watching. Everything I did here was so self-indulgent lol. \n I’ll be back, Vietnam. Thank you for your rich history and culture. I learned a lot of your history after coming here, and I have huge respect for the people. \n I will forever remember this place close to my heart ❤️.\n    submitted by    /u/loosegreyshirt  \n [link]   [comments]",

Although the apartment allows pets, there is a significant number of residents who strongly dislike them and the residents are majority older generation. They often demonstrate closed-mindedness, rudeness, and narcissistic behavior. Additionally, the staff, including security guards and cleaners, engage in gossip and talk behind our backs. I have personally experienced consistent rudeness from an older female cleaner. She unnecessarily reprimanded me when I was about to walk my dog after exiting the lift while she was cleaning. I was unaware of her cleaning schedule, but since then I avoid walking my dog at that time. She has also spread rumors among other residents, falsely labeling my dog and me as dirty. It's clear that she holds a personal grudge against me and my dog. I have been ignoring her but she constantly says it when I'm around and it is bothering me a bit. \n    submitted by    /u/DelusionalBroccoli  \n [link]   [comments]",

They said between the three: Viettel, Mobifone and Vinaphone; Viettel wins consistency and core quality, while Vinaphone wins fastest speed almost 3x the second winner being Viettel. Mobifone eats dirt in almost every metric and I feel blind after reading that report. \n You see, I've been using the same operator for more than a decade and I wonder if there is better fit for my needs, maybe you can find yours here too. I'm first:\n I use Mobifone.\n Connectivity is okay, worse on height, not much 5G. \n Customer service is helpful and does available 24/7. \n Good data package, I paid 300k VND per month for 8GB data daily. There are plenty options. \n Their App works fine for all basic stuff you need, but the UI always feels like still in the Beta stage and not fully functional.

It seems that I'm not eligible to apply for an exemption of work permit since I don't have a sponsor company in Vietnam and technically speaking, I don't work for any company in Vietnam.\n Does anybody have any experience applying for an exemption of work permit in Vietnam or something similar?\n Best regards \n    submitted by    /u/skisssbb  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am currently in Vietnam for the second time as an adult and I hear the term Viet Kieu a lot.\n Viet Kieu is a person with Vietnamese blood that is living outside of Vietnam, whether they were born in Vietnam or another country. \n Sometimes people call me a Viet Kieu or I will tell them that I am a Viet Kieu. Now that I think about it, is it a good thing or bad thing? I know is it a way to label us but I have been saying it with pride. \n I know different people have their own opinions about Viet Kieu. People may like or dislike us, think we are rich, or expect us to bring gifts from our country to give to our relatives in Vietnam. They may look down on us because we escaped our home country due to the war or think we are lucky because we were able to create a life outside of Vietnam. We may or may not be rich in our country but the money exchange from our country to Vietnam makes us look rich.\n I rented an apartment with my family and they told me all the Viet Kieu lives in this apartment. My family told me girls will want us for citizenship. My mom told me not to tell people that I am in a Viet Kieu in public because I will get robbed.\n A lot of people try to talk to me in English. When I start talking to them in Vietnamese, they would tell me that they thought I was from overseas. I tell them I was born and live overseas. I do ask the locals about this in person but Reddit is a better platform to be straight up. Some people that I ask are the older generation that lived through the war or the new generation that were born after the war. \n Give it to me straight. Give me your opinion.

My cousin and I were talking about it but we didn't have a good reason as to why. \n What is the reason?!\n    submitted by    /u/xpleaseandthankyoux  \n [link]   [comments]",

Any time he needs to communicate something to me he uses Google translate, and he does know a few phrases like \"thank you\" and \"good night,\" but today he brings his phone up to me and shows me his question, which is that he would like help learning English. \n He asked for my phone number and I didn't want to be rude, so I gave it to him, but he texted me saying he needs someone to help him learn English. \n I'm not really a teacher, and I definitely don't speak Vietnamese. I want to provide some sort of help, because he's always so nice and patient when I'm helping with whatever he needs around the gym, but I'm at a loss for what to say. \n I was hoping maybe reddit would be a good place to find people who understand Vietnamese culture, and might know what sort of help he is looking for specifically?\n (I have texted him asking if he is Vietnamese just to be sure. I really hope that doesn't come off as rude. Just trying my best guys. Waiting on that response)\n (I flaired this as discussion but realistically a flair like \"language\" might be more apt.

          "description": "Hi everyone! My name is Victor, from Saigon Dragon Studios. For a bit more than 2 years now we’ve worked on the RTS game Space Tales, and today we’re making its Steam page public :)\n https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457960/Space_Tales/?beta=0\n Quick background about us: we’ve launched SDS in 2015, as an outsourcing studio specializing in video game 2D and 3D arts. Vietnam (and HCMC) are well known in the video game industry as several top outsourcing companies are located there. A ton of Vietnamese talents have worked on famous games/movies. Surprisingly however, there aren’t many studios in Vietnam who develop and publish their own games (– whenever I am in a game convention for example I always hear ‘ah yes Vietnam, it’s where Flappy Bird was made”, which really annoys me because it’s not representative of the talents Vietnam has.)\n A couple of years ago we decided to start working on our own game in parallel of our outsourcing services, and we wanted to do as much as possible in Vietnam (only music and sounds are being made elsewhere). We still have a lot of work to do on our game, but we would love to hear your feedback on what we have to show for now.\n The teaser for our game can also be watched on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elHEmpUTcEk \n Looking forward to receiving your feedback.\n    submitted by    /u/SDS_SpaceTales  \n [link]   [comments]",

My mom basically forced me to come with her this past June, and I was dreading it bc the time difference, the heat, and the fact that it’s more of a developing country and I’m so spoiled in the Us. Well that was so naive of me because I definitely had an unforgettable experience and vietnam blew me away. \n We backpacked a bit through vietnam, we went to Saigon, Canh Tho, Cu Chi, Sapa, Hanoi, halong bay, phu quoc, Mekong, tay ninh. At first when I landed I couldn’t wait to get back home. But throughout the trip , the sights were in believable, the food amazing, the motorbikes were so fun, and just cruising through the streets people watching of the cities was so enjoyable. There was just so much to see culture wise as well and opened my eyes to a different lens of the world. and now that I’m back home I feel a small heartache which I wasn’t expecting. It’s been 2 days and I’m still thinking abt this trip\n Although some people were rude and inconsiderate, most were so kind, they treated me and my sister like celebrities. (I thought we looked viet but guess not lol) ppl were constantly approaching us saying we were beautiful. Also i noticed that everyone talks to each other like they already know each other, which is so different than in america. I loved vietnam and want to go back again. This trip holds a special place in my heart and I think will trigger me to start travelling internationally more because that was transformative\n    submitted by    /u/jnn-11000  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately I've been struggling with health problems for the last couple of years, and so this trip is very much going to be a relax by the pool type of affair.\n I was considering Hoi An or potentially Sapa for a 10 day stay? The touristy nature of Hoi An is a bit confronting whereas the Northern mountain ranges are attractive as hell to me. Can anyone lend their opinion/give any recommendations for a resort-style stay that isn't going to be busy to the point of stressful?\n Proposed Itinerary\n December 1st - 4th Fly into Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay for a few nights to recover from flight\n December 4th - 14th Bus/train/plane to destination and stay for 10 days\n December 14th - 17th Bus/train/plane back to Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay a few days before departure\n Additional Info\n  \nI should be able to manage around 5,000 steps each day\n Budget is around $4,000 AUD for two people for 17 days (not including flights)\n I'm used to travelling for the adventure so this style of travel will be very new to me.

          "description": "​\n Tôi là nam 18 tuổi và đã đến Catfe trong chuyến đi đến Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh ở Việt Nam (ngày 19 tháng 6). Khi tôi ở đó, tôi đã thử vuốt ve một con mèo mới được giới thiệu với Catfe. Trước khi có thể vuốt ve con mèo, một cô gái tình cờ cảnh báo tôi rằng con mèo mới đến và nó cắn. Dù sao tôi cũng quyết định vuốt ve nó và cuối cùng bị trầy xước, nhưng điều mà tôi vẫn nghĩ sau đó là giọng nói của cô gái đó nghe thật hấp dẫn làm sao. Tôi không nghĩ đến việc bắt chuyện vì tôi muốn nhìn thấy nhiều mèo hơn, nhưng càng nghĩ về tình huống đó, tôi càng nghĩ về cách tôi nên tiếp cận cô gái mặc quần yếm màu hồng đó. Cô ấy không chỉ có giọng hát hay mà còn rất xinh đẹp và thậm chí trang phục của cô ấy cũng rất tuyệt. Nếu điều này đến được với cô ấy, tôi sẽ coi đó là một phép màu. \n ​\n I am an 18 year old male and went to a Catfe during my trip to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam (June 19). While I was there I tried petting a new cat that was introduced to the Catfe. Before being able to pet the cat, a girl just so happened to warn me that cat was new and that it bites. I decided to pet it anyway and ended up getting scratched, but what I kept thinking about afterwards was how attractive that girls voice sounded. I didn't think about starting a conversation because I wanted to see more cats, but the more I think about that situation, the more I think about how I should have approached that girl in pink overalls. Not only was her voice pretty, but she was beautiful too and even her outfit was awesome. If this ever reaches her I would consider it a miracle. \n ​\n Catfe address: CATFE, 119 Đ.

Then you just click on the words and it will translate the word and the phrase.\n You can download it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jorgeperezgomez.flreader2\n Future versions will store the words for future review, provide basic lessons on grammar so the user can read the book, and so on. But I wanted to share the app first and find early adopters who could give me some feedback about how it can be improved.\n We also have a reddit sub where people will be able to tell us what they think, ask for new features and so on: https://www.reddit.com/r/FLReader/\n    submitted by    /u/Nguyenvan21  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I've heard it's extremely slow) Are the kind of locals willing to move faster and/or hook-up, the same kind that you'd want to date or not at all?\n \nfrom dating apps: first dates as coffee dates or wine/cocktail dates? Or something else? (I never invite ppl over directly from apps - I need to feel a personal connection first and also for safety reasons)\n \nis going to a bar/club alone a thing? Or only some clubs/bars are good for this?\n \nultimately, where do you meet people and socialize? I tend to do a lot of \"expat event\" kind of things but, depending on the country, the ppl that show up are not necessarily the nicest.\n \nwould it be very limiting to try and date only other expats?\n \nfinally, what pitfalls you'd warn another foreigner about?\n \n No need to answer each and every.

Last week I received news that he had fallen incredibly ill so I booked a last minute trip to Vietnam to visit him for about 3 weeks. Although this isn't exactly a vacation as I plan on helping to care for my dad, I'm sure there will still be plenty of opportunities to go exploring and get back in touch with my Vietnamese heritage.\n Given that I haven't gone by since I was 6 and that I'm from California, I really have no idea how to prepare. What should I bring? What should I be cautious about? What are some dos and don'ts? I'm a pretty open-minded eater and literally wish to try all the things. Any recommendations?\n Other things about me:\n My Vietnamese is decent, I understand the southern accent very well and can get by in terms of speaking, but things get a little rough if the other person has a northern accent. If the other person has a central accent, no way lol. Unfortunately I can't read Vietnamese either.\n I'm terrible at dealing with the heat but can manage if I have to.\n I'm not taking days off work and plan to work (I'm a software engineer director) as well. How's the coffee shop scene over in Nha Trang?\n Any recommendations on what I must do over there on this last minute unplanned trip would also be appreciated!\n Edit: Spelling\n    submitted by    /u/solidiquis1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to show the people here that I’m not a foreigner who only speaks English.\n Here’s the thing - I’m doing job interviews at the moment trying to get a job, but have limited money at the moment. I did a trial lesson at a centre, and after the lesson they asked if I wanted to pay for my tuition fees then and there. The fees were 19.6 for 80 hours (I believe?) but I told them I don’t have the money for it currently due to finding work and not employed. I really want to start learning as soon as possible, but really struggle with apps such as Duolingo and resources like YouTube. I can’t learn anything from there - I get super distracted because of my ADHD and prefer in-class.\n Do you have any suggestions, or should I just wait until I start getting a salary and have more money?

Then I see others with fans out. Then I see others bolting into air conditioned buildings just drenched. How are y'all handling this heat?

I was initially planning to order it online and have it delivered to Bitexco Tower or any nearby branch but I can't proceed with the website order page. From step 2 shipment details, it doesnt proceed to step 3 select payment. So I might just check and buy it in the actual Samsung Store. Is it true that you cannot buy in the Bitexco branch? The other nearest to my hotel is the 134 Nguyen Thai Hoc St. branch. Anyway, can anyone check the latest price of Samsung S23+ in HCM? I just wanted to check if it's the same as the one in store. Also, if this is the wrong sub to post this inquiry, please help me identify the correct one.\n Since I'm already here, any tips on my upcoming trip? Previously went to Hanoi already. Can anyone perhaps help me identify the correct sequence of how I should plan my route/itinerary to visit the most famous spots in the city?

          "description": "I live a great life in the U.S. but as I am sitting at work, I still think about moving back to Vietnam or how to do so in the future. This obsession has been going on for years now.\n I'm aware of all the pros and cons, it's just that I have this strange yearning to be there. My mom passed away last year and her family is still in Vietnam. We are very close and I want to live near her family before they all pass away as well. They are one connection I have left with her.\n The main issue is that I won't be able to get more than 3-4 weeks vacation off each year from work, and tickets will cost around 8k now. The flight is so long too just for a trip where we'll be spending at least one week with jetlag and stomach issues. Plus, my wife wants to go on vacations/beaches while I just want to near Quan 7 with the relatives.\n I've thought about moving to Orange County or Houston to ease this feeling, but those Vietnamese cities just don't feel the same. \n I know the future is far brighter in 15 years for the family if I stay in the U.S., I just feel sad each day working. I spend hours thinking about having enough money to live in Vietnam without worrying about the future.\n It's not rose-tinted glasses either, I worked remotely and had lived in Vietnam for 6 months recently with my wife/child. It was great. I know education and healthcare might be a problem later on. Waking up early for coffee and breakfast while watching the crazy traffic, going out to eat seafood/hot pot at night - that just can't be beaten.\n I suppose I'm just ranting and being too greedy. I can always get a significant pay cut/career limitation and get a remote job to live in Vietnam. It's just that I want what's best for my family/kid's future as well.\n Does anyone(especially the Viet Kieus) feel the same way?\n    submitted by    /u/baoluvboa  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My wife and I just returned from a month long trip in Vietnam and her hometown of Saigon. We had an amazing time. Now that we’ve been home in the states for 2 weeks she just got a call from a number her caller ID says was the Vietnamese Embassy. They claimed that someone was using her name/info in Vietnam to scam people and that she needed to work with the police in Vietnam to clear her name. They transferred her to a police station in Vietnam and the police officer used Viber to video talk with my wife in full uniform. She declined when he started asking for passport information. He said if she does not trust it she can investigate herself or find another way to have it investigated. Has anyone got a call like this before? The phone numbers check out online but this just screams scam to me. Just looking for advice and how to move forward with this?\n    submitted by    /u/JJKokomoKid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I live in Vietnam. I went back home and when I came back to Vietnam I brought some souvenirs and gifts. Nothing special. I was brought up \"minimalist\". I never bought fancy gifts for my partners, friends, and family. So, why would I do that to people who are, well, at the periphery of my friendzone?\n And all in all: Isn't it the thought that counts?\n Anyhow, my gifts received some harsh comments. For instance, a Vietnamese friend got some brand clothes from Europe. I bought some toys for his younger brother. Do you know Playmobil? A bit like Lego. I confess, the two toys (a Wild-west Fort and a Pirate ship) were on discount. But they cost about 100$. That is more than I gave to my bf for Christmas, LOL. Anyhow, I can survive that a 10yo doesn't say thankyou and is happy. But my friend said, that his brother was disappointed because he wanted some more \"valuable\".\n I am not on a paylevel which enables me to throw around with MacBooks and Iphones. I do not have such devices neither.\n Another time I was invited and I bought a 25$ red wine bottle. In my home country Germany that would already be too much. Most guests will spend about 10-15$. No one really awaits a 1,000$-bottle of Rothschild stuff.\n Anyhow, the host was quite rude. During the evening he showed my bottle, made a gesture like vomitting and put it aside. Then he presented a fancy Whiskey bottle and told everyone that the bottle was about 200$. This person was not even close to me, so why would I pay 200$ for some alcohol? I am in general a generous guy, but these two examples (there are quite more in my experience) are really too much. I understand, I am the \"rich\" foreigner. But they cannot really await that I come of dozens of Iphones, cars, laptops? I feel really sad, since my personal life is not circling around consumption.\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_Kha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mainstream stuff is extremely low-brow, while art-house offerings often appear nonsensical and lacking substance. Many galleries and events rely almost exclusively on foreign funds like the Goethe Institute. I'm curious about the differences between our art scene and those of other developing countries. Is there a way to bridge this gap and create artistically profound and entertaining art, similar to what filmmakers like Bong Joon Ho and Park Chan Wook have achieved in Korea?\n    submitted by    /u/aphdnh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Fairly sure I just got scammed, just wanting to make sure and any precautions I should take- gave the guy my email.\n Guy came up to me on the street with his scooter and started talking to me, picking me as Australian. Told me he has family in Australia and telling me all about them. Asked if I'd like to get a drink with him, which I was happy to do!\n Spent some time drinking with him, during which time he told me his family were visiting and they were having a big party. When it was time to go, he asked if I'd buy a bottle of wine for their party, which I agreed to do. He took me about a 10min ride away to a shop to buy wine, which cost 900,000 dong and then took me back to where we met. I realised at the time the wine was very expensive but I was a little drunk and didn't know where I was exactly so I didn't protest. I assume he just takes the wine back and splits the profits with the shop! \n While we were drinking he took my email, I assume he'll try and have me send money for something else, but should I watch out for anything else? \n Thanks for any advice!\n    submitted by    /u/bonjarden  \n [link]   [comments]",
