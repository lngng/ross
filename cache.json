My favorite one is Gopchang (grilled pork and beef intestines)\n I asked bf, but he said it’s not popular. I guess he just wants me to persuade me to cook another dishes, because he can not eat intestines 😚😙😗\n If you guys eat intestines, what is your favorite type of cooking? In Korea, we often do barbecue (grill). Are there any Korean dishes, which Vietnamese people love? I’m willing to learn and cook for them\n Last time, I asked “how to impress viet parents” in this sub. Your suggestions helped me a lot, and I was successful.

I’m watching Young Sheldon (the series is set in Medford, Texas in the 80s-90s btw), and Sheldon has a Vietnamese friend named Tam. His mom always packs dimsum for him, to the point he’s sick of it.\n Dimsum is generally a Chinese food. I know we have dimsum here too but it’s still thought of as a Chinese food, or đồ Hoa.\n So my question is, do Vietnamese Americans have dim sum for lunch that often too? Or is it just another case of filmmakers/showrunners mixing up Asian people and following stereotypes?\n Again, this is just me contemplating about things in life. No big deal either way.

          "description": "Hello everyone! \n Im coming to Vietnam, to Ho Chi Minh 11th October, and I'm really confused. We have 11 days available and we returning to the same airport. My question is: What to do there? :) I had a lot of work before holiday and I couldn't prepare for this. Im starting now :) \n I was wondering about rental motorbike, but im not sure cause im going with my girlfriend and we have 2 big backpacks. What do you think guys?\n And im looking for something special, im not big fan of architecture, rather we prefer local experience and nature. I don't like the crowds too, but I know that's normal in big cities and popular attractions. \n ​\n In short - can you give us some hidden gems? And what do you think about rental 2 bikes ( My GF is driver too) and traveling from Ho Chi Minh to Hoi An. Or maybe we should take a plane and rent bikes there? And last but not least - weather. Im a little nervous when I see a forecast. \n    submitted by    /u/Infamous-Net-2163  \n [link]   [comments]",

Regardless the whole nation is called into question for some behavior.\n You guys do know that Vietnam is a country of over 100m population, with polarized income and living conditions, plus having worldwide diasporas (in North America, Australia, European continent, African continent, East Asia, the Middle East) so finding an average Nguyen is nigh impossible, right???\n Instead of asking “Why my Vietnamese relative treat me like shit?” or “Why Vietnamese male drink coffee all morning and doesn’t go to work?” People can rephrase it such as “why my relative treat me like shit?” - does the fact that they are Vietnamese or Vietnamese immigrants play any roles in the question?\n    submitted by    /u/Tiberiux  \n [link]   [comments]",

Initially, my father didn't want any part of me when my mother got pregnant because I was an accident. He impregnated my mom when he was 25, and she was 15. Before I was born, he tried to persuade my mom to have an abortion. I met him for the first time at the age of 5 and then reconnected with the family at the age of 12. My stepmom is mostly the reason why I wasn't around, as my father lied to her and never disclosed my existence until my mom basically gave him an ultimatum to accept me as his son. If he didn't, she would take him to court for child support, which she did, and he paid until I turned 18. My stepmom is also the reason I re-entered the family …",

Meanwhile he expects me to do a master’s degree and work full time as well. He teaches me things like: - It’s fine for men to have a high body count before marriage but girls should keep themselves pure - It’s a woman’s job to do the cooking, cleaning, etc. (including things like having to cut my husband’s finger and toe nails) - I shouldn’t do a doctor’s degree because men are deterred from women with higher education - It’s justified if my husband cheats if I don’t provide him with a warm meal and children\n My mother works full time as well but he feels entitled to everything she does for him.

As the title already states, which city is the best to visit in December?\n My best friend and I haven't seen each other for years (we live in different countries now) and we're thinking of travelling and reuniting in Vietnam. \n We both would like to indulge ourselves in Vietnam's food and culture. We both enjoy long walks, have some drinks, and trying out some things new! (something more \"local\" and maybe not too touristy haha)\n Any recommendations and suggestions are highly appreciated.

Eventually I went to the Wise website to see if something was locked with my card and I stumbled on a support page that listed countries that US accounts won’t work in. \n I have a card from my US bank so I’ll probably just take the fee on the chin or consider using the Western Union app to send myself some money in the morning.\n    submitted by    /u/Mlrk3y  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe in some countries you can get even fined if you occupy the left lane for no reason \n Do you believe a culture of left lane for passing only can be adopted here?

I love Vietnamese food (Banh Mi, soups and salads) and excited to try authentic fare as well as experience the culture. Some of my questions and concerns needing answers from travelers who have been there: -Visa. I believe visitors will need a visa to enter. Could anyone share the link to apply for the visa application? Can it be an online application, how much and how long to get the visa. -Money to get around. Are credit cards accepted or only cash? -Wifi access. Would getting a local SIM to access the internet be the best way? Do the Vietnamese telcos offer inexpensive prepaid SIMs and roughly how much? -Must sees and do's in Ho Chi Minh. Recommended places of interest to see and unique experiences would be great. -Souvenirs. What's good to bring home from Vietnam? I would appreciate your practical tips and suggestions.

On the surface, things sound pretty decent, especially since they offer a housing allowance. \n My pay according to the contract (before taxes) is 473,000 VND an hour (20 teaching hours a week), on top of a housing allowance of 7,000,000 VND per month. It's a standard 12-month contract. \n My main priorities are to learn how to be a good teacher, save as much as I can, and try to avoid stress as much as possible. That being said, I want to make sure ILA is a good fit for me. I don't mind the region I'm staying in (Can Tho) since I doubt I'm gonna leave my apartment much... for me, the priority is just learning a local culture and saving money. \n Does anyone have any experiences with ILA that they'd be willing to share? I understand that avoiding stress is impossible as a teacher, but I just want to make sure that they've got a good support system in place. The last thing I want is to be overworked or overwhelmed with stuff that they didn't mention in the interview or the contract... only to realize I could've had that same experience here, in the states. \n Long story shrot, this is the only offer I think I'll be getting from Vietnam... and I'm stuck between taking it and just giving up and sticking to living in the states. I don't want to go overseas and get burned out on teaching since I'm gonna be doing that for a living... \n Please let me know, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Uncanny_Hero  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I would like to hear your opinions about it today.\n I would like to start with my first experience with this issue. After I finished with my university, I got hired into a Vietnamese branch of a Japanese self-driving car start up. Things were fine back then except for one thing. My CEO. He was a total Japanese-supremacy guy (He is Vietnamese, btw). One day, me and my senior had to work overtime to fix some issues that the our Japanese colleagues made. It was a mismanagement problem, so while we were okay with working overtime to fix it, we thought it would be more productive to raise this problem in the next meeting…",

Nạn nhân ở đây là người phụ nữ Phan Thị Mỹ Hằng.\n Thoạt đầu tưởng rằng chỉ là trò bịp bợm của ai đó trên mạng nhưng hóa ra không phải. Khi thấy điểm bất ngờ nên tôi đã nghiên cứu qua thử thì thấy có rất nhiều điểm đáng để nói trong vụ án lần này.\n Trước khi tới tình tiết phân tích chuyên sâu, nếu ai đã đọc quyển sách Đêm trường tăm tối của Tử Kim Trần thì sẽ thấy sự giống y hệt xã hội chúng ta đang sống hiện tại.

I do not yet live in Vietnam, so when I search on my Dell from the USA, even if I search in Spanish (my second language), my results are highly skewed and unhelpful.\n If anyone has links, knows of good recruiting companies, or anything, I'd greatly appreciate it!

My dad was half white and was kicked out of the hospital by my brother’s grandma. He wasn’t allowed to see his son after that. My dad eventually made it to America but has always missed my brother. My grandma did not know of my brother because he was born out of wedlock. I accidentally let it slip. \n I’m contemplating doing a DNA test and potentially finding him. I want to do an American one as well since my grandpa (my dads father) was a lieutenant during the war. Though, I do want to meet my brother the most. To let him know my dad didn’t willingly abandon him. Have them meet. Help my grandma meet her first grandchild as she always thought I was the first. \n If anyone has any insight, that’ll be extremely helpful. Thank you.\n Edit: when I ask, “do people in Vietnam do these tests” it’s because I’m asking if it’s commonplace and if it’s as popular in other countries.

Are there mandatory checks somewhere? Are they somehow skippable?\n I understand that this is at all NOT recommended, but desperate times call for desperate means.

However, after a whole day of studying I felt drained? And I have a feeling that applying to college was a huge mistake or something. I'm think about withdrawing my college tuition fees if this keeps going on in the future.\n I applied to the Diplomatic Acedamy of Vietnam(DAV) by the way. Was it because I took a break for so long that I've grown accustomed to being lazy all day? Or was it something else? DAV is famous for having cut-throat competitive environment so maybe that's why? I felt totally intimidated by the environment. Maybe it was a huge mistake applying here. Deep down I have always had the desire to run away from society and become a hermit or a beggar so that I can get this mental turmoil off my head.\n I know some of you might think that I am being childish or immature but really, it got so bad that I quitted everything for a whole year and stayed at home doing nothing but house chores and walking around the neighborhood. Honestly I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me anymore. I am thinking of using my remaining savings to... run away somewhere before... committing suicide.\n    submitted by    /u/Efficient_Entry_5160  \n [link]   [comments]",

My mom got a \"heart situation\" and we called for an ambulance. On the way to the hospital the ER people said it was a myocardial infarction (heart attack). However, the doctorS (stress on plural cause multiple of them reviewed her case and i saw it) said they \"dont think\" that's the case. They suspect it to be a heart failure, \"maybe\" caused by either hypotension or hypoglycemia. Thats about everything they ever said during an entire week she was there.\n Well, here I am half a year later and still have no clue what actually happened to my mother and how i could prevent it from happening again. Cause they dont tell me or her or my dad. They just said dont worry rest well blah blah. They dont even give us the medical record, just a prescription paper in which it said thats the illness were \"related to coronary artery disease and other types of diabetes\".\n So why cant you tell us whats wrong with us? You cant or you're not allowed to? Is it a personal thing or a professional thing? Is it a public vs private hospital thing?

          "description": "Hello, so i am having my first solo travel in November.\n At the moment I scheduled 25 days in Vietnam. However from viewing different itineraries and youtube videos I was kina turned off by south Vietnam.\n My main priorities are breathtaking nature and sporty/extreme activities, like ziplines, surfing, diving.\n I don't care for big cities ,cultural tours, partying and craftsmentship workshops (which i heared there are a lot of in Hoi-an). Originally I was planning to go with my girlfriend, and these activities are fun as a couple, but I just don't think I will enjoy them as a solo traveler.\n I have read that north Vietnam's nature is amazing and compared to it South Vietnam is underwhelming and has more of the content that i am less inclined towards.\n Therefore I am considering the option of doing about 2 weeks in North Vietnam, focusing on the Loop, The caves, Sapa etc, and then transfering for a short diving/surfing vacation in the phillipins(which excites me but I was originally fine to give up to travel with my ex-gf) . I thought about Thailand as well but i had been there a few years ago. I might be able to add a few days to a week to my trip for that.\n I would love to hear about if someone thinks the plan is feasible / change my mind regarding south Vietnam/ present another option (Cambodia?)\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Small-Tip-8816  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I will be traveling to Vietnam in November and I will mostly stay in the North of Vietnam (Ha Giang, Sapa, Ha Long Bay, Ninh Binh) where the weather will be nice. I love outdoor stuff like hiking and trekking and therefore I would love to visit Phong Nha Ke Bang national park (it looks absolutely stunning!) and do an overnight trekking tour there. However, it seems that the national park is located in central Vietnam where November is part of the raining season. As a result Oxalis is not offering a lot of tours but I found another organization (Jungle Boss) that is offering several tours, even in caves. \n I’ve been trying to find out how bad it really is in November based on the experiences of other travelers and information on websites, but I’m getting lots of contradictory results. Is it a 100% chance of rain every day and should I be expecting rain all day long? Or should I expect some short (but intense) showers every day and is there also chance to see some sun? \n Also, when I look up temperatures most websites mention temperatures between 66°F (19°C) to 75°F (24°C), however, on other websites I read that it can get unbearably cold during the night. It’s very confusing as I would not describe 20 degrees Celsius as unbearably cold. \n I know it would be best to come back to Vietnam for the central part another time, but I don’t think I’ll be back in Vietnam soon as there are so many other places on my travel bucket list as well. And I also know that the weather can’t be predicted but it would be great to hear at least some real experiences from other travelers in November. Not just in Ke Bang national park but experiences from central Vietnam in general will be appreciated.\n (My native language is not English, sorry for any misspelling)\n    submitted by    /u/Atelerixis  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nobody would ask me to eat my snacks/dinners/etc. This never bugged me but it did always cross my mind when I would go to take my food home and there was no food left! It now appears to me, having been to a recent work banquet, where my co-workers grabbed several smaller bowls and placed different variations of their pho and egg noodles for me to taste. And it doesn't stop there, they always offer me to try new things. From desserts with potato to different variations of noodles.

When you go to Hue, you can see the ancient Hue Imperial City and the famous Temple. You can walk by the river during the day and go to nearby bars to drink and listen to songs at night. It is a very pleasant life.\n The day and night in Hoi An Ancient Town are particularly attractive. Walk around the ancient town during the day, go to a nearby coffee shop for a cup of coffee and some cake. You can also go to the riverside at night, and both sides are very beautiful! There are many famous restaurants nearby! My favorite coffee shop is Mia Coffee. Their cakes are very delicious and the coffee is also great. It should be reminded that Hoi An's consumption is higher than that of Hue and even in Da nang, which may be due to tourist cities! What you get with the same money is not worth it! But this is the reason why it is a tourist city. It should be noted that there are some stores that do not indicate the price, and the boss may overpay tourists!\n I mainly went to Monkey Mountain and the Pink Church in Da nang, as well as the Cham Sculpture Museum. If you are interested in Cham culture, you can go and have a look! Very good! You can also go to the holy places of Meishan, which are some historical relics of Hinduism. The night in Da nang is beautiful! There are many lively bars where you can go for a drink. However, I ended up spending time at the Hilton Hotel in Da nang. During the day, I also went to the beach for a drink, ate some snacks, and lay on the beach chair to read. It was very comfortably. The executive lounge of the Hilton Hotel is also very good!

I don't mean to offend anyone by judging the children, but I'd like to hear your opinion.\n I usually visit certain coffee shops on the weekends to find new inspiration and refresh my mind. I tend to be more creative in such places. Lately, I've been frequenting The Coffee House due to its spacious and comfortable ambiance for working. However, I've encountered some issues with families that bring their children, typically around 3 to 5 years old. These kids never sit still, always yelling and running around without much supervision from their parents. Moreover, the parents in these families tend to speak loudly, trying to overcome the noise created by their children, and sometimes they reprimand their children when they glance at the kids attempting to break something. This results in a significant amount of chaos, which can be quite anxious. It feels more like a kindergarten than a place for adults.\n I want to emphasize once again that I'm not passing judgment on the children or their parents. However, from my perspective, it appears that the awareness of some individuals nowadays is somewhat lacking, and this could potentially have a negative impact on their children's behavior and attitudes (It is actually occurring now)\n Peace.\n    submitted by    /u/Namtrungksxd  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's a lot of children needing a home, if you want a child just adopt them, why create for yourself the trouble of having to deal with weddings, the wife's family side and stuff. Beside, you have the time to connect to a kid before deciding you could bond with it or not\n But my mother, told me that I'm crazy and a non blood-related child could never be loyal to me, and always leave me in the end. I told her that I want to father a child not to have someone to take care of me, but to have the feeling that If I were to pass away, I have done something right with my life. I don't know how to explain this, but it's like I will live my whole life accumulating money, knowledge and experiences, and it would feel like it'll be all for nothing if I won't spend all of those things on helping and nurturing someone else.

I know i'm not good enough to take responsible for such a huge commitment ( i'm not grown up enough ), not at least until i can provide for myself. We had a lot of arguments that i should accept the fact that she might leave me as she wants the best thing for her. Since then, she changed, the way she loved, the way she talked, everything must be exactly what she wants so she can trust that i'm good enough to be the one for her. Not until a lot of pressures i've been through recently, even when she is one of the biggest pressure feel, now i cant take it anymore, just want to kill myself sometimes. Not even mentioned of the things she wanted me to become when she won't accept me for who i am. I cried so much i start losing sleep, losing hairs,... However, she still cares for me, make me feel comfortable and she points out the best in me.\n What should i do when breaking up with my gf is the best thing for both of us but we love each other so much, i know it, i'm just too selfish to admit that to let her go...\n    submitted by    /u/AlexZx29  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I only got to spend a week there, and I did a lot of typical tourist activities. I'm American, but I actually went on vacation visiting from China back in 2019. I had been living in Beijing for a year. Beijing is a tier 1 Chinese city, but the vibe is... depressing. People generally look unhappy and stoic, similar to Soviet style culture I suppose. Chinese are inoffensive in customer service, but just... cold. When I landed in Hanoi, which is supposedly the conservative part of Vietnam, the difference was night and day. Interactions with hotel workers, restaurant workers etc was warm and welcoming. English was spoken widely, which again is total opposite of Beijing. What struck me the most was the energy. You could \"feel\" the progress in the air, like it was an up place where the best is yet to come. I heard China had a similar vibe in the early 2000s. Contrast with China now tho, which by 2019 had already apexed and was showing clear signs of decline. I stayed at a Hilton in the center of Hanoi and it was buzzing with business travelers. Clearly it's a growing hub of activity. I also did a junk boat trip in ha long bay, and the guy on the boat was talking about how better life has gotten in just the last 5 years. From the warm locals, to the food (tho I'll be honest Hanoi food wasn't that great, but the street food was fun and cheap... heard HCM is the place to go for food), the vibe in the air, Vietnam stole my heart and I can't wait to return. I've been to well over a dozen countries and lived in 4 continents. I would absolutely love to spend a year or two in Vietnam as it rapidly transforms and grows it's presence on the global stage. I wish you all success, I know life isn't easy for all, but as someone who's \"been around the block\", Vietnam is special.

I quit my marketing job back home and wanted a break to travel, so I booked flights to Vietnam to be here for roughly a month. I arrived in Hanoi on the 6th of this month, and I'm still here.\n I'm enjoying your country. I'm considering to stay, if it is possible.\n Is it?\n I would want/need to get a job. My talent is marketing (specifically English/Dutch content and SEO), and I speak English fluently, my accent however is bad.\n Besides that, I would of course need the needed documentation, like a work visa.

This time though I am with my girlfriend and so would maybe be interested in using a bike, sometimes, instead of taking separate trips or cars. \n When in HCMC, we have walking distance all we need, and I would not want to use a bike here anyway. \n But in a place like Da Lat, or maybe Đà Nẵng, or Huế, I wonder if all things considered it would be a good idea. \n  \nI do not want any problems with the police, so I am wondering worst case scenario what is the biggest issue we could have, a fine? Or worse? How likely is a stop anyway, I have been in Asia a lot and always see foreigners riding bikes, some with helmets (as we would) and some without (foolish) and never seen anyone have an issue. But I have heard online of issues. \n How safe would it even be? I will avoid one hundred percent HCMC/Hanoi, but in quieter places will it be better?\n Realistically how hard is it to drive the bikes? I have ridden quads before, and also bicycles (I’d that’s relevant) \n  \nIt’s just likely that renting a bike in places like da làt to go see some more far away places would be ideal and cost effective. \n If it is not a good idea though, we will just have to figure out another plan.\n    submitted by    /u/Ambitious-Ad1884  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been a completed troll. I've enforced punishments, like making them stand for the duration of the lesson (now we have been told we are not to punish in anyway as learning English is just an 'extra' class, not important).\n I've explained that their behavior is unacceptable, and when someone is speaking you listen. Especially a teacher. Right after explaining they turn right around to the person behind them, and start talking or playing Uno.\n Then there is the fighting in class. Last week two boys had a full on punch up in the classroom over who got the answer right. \n The other day I walked into a classroom, and a boy looked at me and said 'what the fuck is this?' \n It's a fight from beginning to end.

I can read very poorly but could get by if it was a life or death situation). What would be a good way to find a local guide who can dedicate 2-4 weeks to showing me around the entire country? \n I feel this would be a good opportunity for a recent grad who wants to practice English (with someone who is fluent in both English and Vietnamese) and to go on a free vacation (with modest base pay ~$500USD for one month and basic essentials like food, lodging, etc.) covered. I would also prefer it if they are a woman (because I am female and would feel more comfortable with another woman) who knows how to drive a car/motorbike and who has experience traveling in VN. Am I being unreasonable/ too demanding?\n If it isn't clear, I am asking here because I feel most of the options I see are group tours geared towards tourists who have 0 understanding of Vietnamese language and culture and rely purely on English-speaking guides and tours.

I’ve been in the massive cities in Europe and I’m ready for a slower pace for a while.\n I speak absolutely no Vietnamese. I have no qualms about using google translate, but I want to visit a place where that wouldn’t be viewed as a negative thing. In other words, someplace tourist friendly, even if it isn’t touristy.\n I tend to love seeing museums and historical sites when I travel, so someplace where at least some of that is available.\n I’m not a digital nomad, but decent internet so I can keep in touch with family and friends would be nice.\n Near a beach, even for day trips would be cool, but in no way a requirement.\n  \nAny suggestions?

I’ve got a few ideas but I’m wondering what other people would think of too. Thanks for all the help :))\n    submitted by    /u/Otherwise-Olive-7463  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I'm currently exploring the possibility of manufacturing silicone/tpe based products, and I was wondering if any of you might have some insights or recommendations. I want to emphasize that I'm looking for legitimate manufacturers.\n Here are some specific details about what I'm looking for:\n  \nTooling: We plan to supply our own tooling, so manufacturers who can work with provided molds and specifications would be ideal. However, we're also open to exploring the costs of having tooling made in Vietnam if it makes economic sense.\n Manufacturing Location: While we're open to manufacturers outside Vietnam, we're particularly interested in understanding the manufacturing landscape within Vietnam itself. If you have knowledge about manufacturers in Vietnam or can recommend any reputable companies, please share your insights.\n Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Our initial requirement is a minimum order quantity of 400 units. If you know of manufacturers that can accommodate this quantity or provide competitive pricing at this scale, we'd greatly appreciate your suggestions.\n Packaging: We plan to handle the packaging ourselves, so manufacturers who can provide the product without packaging would be preferred.\n  \nPlease keep in mind that this inquiry is for legitimate purposes, and I'm looking for advice on how to approach this inquiry in a responsible manner.\n Feel free to reply here or send me a private message if you prefer to share information privately. I can also explicitly share images of our products as well. I will also be asking you to provide examples of your work.\n Thank you in advance!\n Best.\n    submitted by    /u/shayeyetuh  \n [link]   [comments]",

First I went to see family in HCM, then I began my solo journey to Hoi An and Da Nang. No issues in either place. but I’ve been in Hanoi since Saturday and walking around I’m noticing a lot of harassment from south Asian tourists . Yesterday I was in Ha Long Bay at the beach and this guy started taking photos of me. Then he came up to me and asked if he could take photos with me, I said no. Another tourist came banging on my hotel door last night on the cruise which scared the crap out of me. I told him to go away. Today I’m back in Hanoi just walking around in the old quarter and a group of them started to stare at me like I was prey. I quickly grabbed my dinner and went back to my hotel.\n I have no issues with south Asians, I have a lot of South Asian friends in the states and also work with them. They are the kindest people. They do not act like this. I just never experienced harassment from like this and it’s kind of bummer it’s happening IN Vietnam.

I went back to vietnam about a week ago to attend my cousins weddings and have had so much fun. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m on vacation but I’ve seen Vietnamese people way more relax and not uptight like Americans. Breakfast and cafe in the morning will thousands of options, my cousin here in Vietnam is a freelance video editor and he works whenever and wherever he wants, around noon all the vendors close for a nap time, and at night eat out (again with thousands of options).\n Meanwhile, I work 9-5 in the states with 30mins lunch time but sometimes I eat at my desk. After work, I have to go to the grocery stores or the gym and sometimes too tired to even cook. Weekends I have to do chores and again grocery. It just feels like time is shorter in the states.\n Everything is getting more expensive in the states so my 75k a year salary doesn’t seem much. My fiancé is a teacher so her job is pretty demanding too. \n I just feel like people in Vietnam just have more what we call ‘freedom’ the U.S has been advertising. I’ve been considering moving back to vietnam for the past few days if I can work remote and my fiancé can teach English but my parents have properties in the states and they have sacrificed so much so I can have the “best” life in America…just some thoughts\n Edit: just to clarify since some people are triggered because I use the word “freedom” what I meant is it just seem that the lifestyle and work style in Vietnam is more relax compared to America but I do understand that I’m here on vacation so people take off work to hang with me\n    submitted by    /u/ChillZilla2077  \n [link]   [comments]",

He said that discounted rides means he gets paid less.\n So, how do payments work for discounted rides?

          "description": "So! It's officially been one month since I moved to Vietnam from America. So far, I'm really liking the country- even though I know I have plenty of room to grow and get to know it better. Given this, I wanted to ask some more trivial questions and provide some general comments as an adjusting newcomer.\n  \nAre measuring cups in cooking not a thing here? None of the stores I've found that have kitchen appliances carry them- even the more specialized ones at Aeon Mall.\n Having witnessed the car-clogged streets of Manhattan, I find the constant flow of motorbikes pretty refreshing (even if I'm terrified to ride one in Ho Chi Minh City).\n I've visited a few Buddhist temples and seen some shrines around, and they often have food in them like apples, kumquats, etc. Is this food for anyone, or does it serve a specific purpose? I don't want to take when I'm not supposed to. EDIT: Answered! I will not take that food.\n I'm still bemused by how frequently I see Lotso Bear. He seems to be pretty popular independent of Toy Story, and I'm not quite sure why.\n I hear that avoiding eye contact is generally used when Vietnamese people are frustrated, since they want to avoid direct confrontation. I've always struggled with eye contact (I'm on the autism spectrum), so would Vietnamese people read that as a sign of anger or hostility?\n  \nGod knows, I have plenty more thoughts, but I've worked through a lot of those with some of my friends.

Cụ thể là tiền thuê nhà, chi phí sinh hoạt, ăn uống hàng ngày mình đều lo cho ảnh mỗi ngày kể từ khi yêu nhau. Ảnh thì đi xin việc ở đâu cũng bị từ chối do có hình xăm nên tính ra từ khi mới yêu ảnh mới đi làm khoảng 3 tháng (không liền nhau). Thời gian còn lại lúc nào cũng kè kè bên mình. Mình luôn động viên ảnh và chỉ yêu cầu ảnh hỗ trợ mình làm 1 vài việc chân tay. Ảnh có cơ thể khá yếu nên hay kêu mệt mỏi với mình, nhiều lúc ốm mình cũng đưa ảnh đi viện để truyền và mua thuốc cho ảnh. Thật sự với mình như vậy là mình quá cảm thông cho ảnh rồi. Nhưng cho đến hôm trước mình như tức nước vỡ bờ. Ảnh mới kiếm được 1 công việc phục vụ 5 tiếng 1 ngày thì tối ảnh tan ca qua đón mình. Đó là ngày thứ 3 anh đi làm. Như mọi hôm mình đưa anh qua cửa hàng tiện lợi mua mì và nước cho ảnh hồi sức. Sau đó bọn mình có chơi game 1 lúc rồi lại về nhà mình ăn cơm và xem phim, sau đó mình cũng gọi nước sinh tố về cho anh bồi bổ. Ăn xong mình chỉ nhờ ảnh rửa bát, lúc mình bảo thì ảnh không nói gì với mình mà cứ lẳng lặng đi làm. Nhưng lúc rửa bát thì ảnh bắt đầu khó chịu với mình và nói mình không biết thông cảm cho anh đi làm cả ngày mệt và tụi mình cãi nhau. Ảnh nói từ nay ảnh không qua ăn cơm là được nhưng suốt 1 năm qua ngày nào ảnh cũng qua ăn. Mình biết tiền không phải thước đo nhưng để làm ra tiền thì mình cũng phải mất công sức và trí tuệ nên với mình đó là tấm lòng của mình. Như vậy là mình chưa thông cảm cho ảnh phải không?\n    submitted by    /u/Harleyjudyzuto  \n [link]   [comments]",

But they kept teasing me about this one word that they refuse to tell me for months, no matter how much I begged.\n They told me it’s so bad they will never teach it to me. It’s apparently a really old slang and you need to be local local to know, hard to find on Google as well, It’s just as bad if not worse than N-word with hard r. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY’RE REFERRING TO?\n Update: It's an old slang for natives, it's used for females specifically. \"Lẹo cái\" seems to be the closest one but it's not complete. It's a banned word on google, my friend's only seen one text that had it written but it's been banned since.

But in the song there was like 3 guy(don’t know if they were brothers or friends) but they were flirting with this one girl. I guess it’s kind of like a love song but more gear towards a younger audience. I remember in the music video the artist rode a bike 😂. Finally the 3 guys made a lot of songs together. Don’t know if they were individual artist working together or they were an actual music group that only made music together.

I heard that most people use \"Mày\", and \"Tao\" to refer to their friends and themselves to their friends, as it's an sign of being intimate and close and comfortable enough with them\n I personally don't like those two pronouns and don't use them much often, I think it could come out quite harsh some times, there's a reason most people don't use it with strangers. But there're people in the North assume it's the default way to call people no matter how close or distant you are, and I hate them so much, it sounds so rude if you and I aren't that close\n With my best friends and friends, I use their personal names/tôi or tao if extremely close. Ông/Tôi and Personal names/Personal names. \n The rare cases I use \"Mày\" and \"Tao\" with my friends are when I'm trying to make a comedy skit or purpousfully acting theatrically with them.\n    submitted by    /u/KeyAndy  \n [link]   [comments]",

A Vietnamese guy introduced these songs to me ☺️\n There’re many reasons I want to explore Vietnam. Youth is too short to settle down.😎\n I know there is a big difference between north and south parts. My friend says HCM’s vibe is similar to Bangkok, so I choose Hanoi. I want something different. My friend will be in Hanoi soon, so he may help me a lot. And I have at least one person to hang out with\n My main concern is job hunting in Vietnam.

I studied abroad here and got a full time job, so I have work experience\n I have a degree in graphics design and diploma in photography. \n How’s graphics design and photography industries in Vietnam? Any chance for me to get a job at a big studios or simply work as freelancer. I want to work for a professional one. I may send portfolio to potential employers.\n My other option is teaching. I took IELTS exam 2 months ago. My overall band is 7.5. Not bad, but not good enough to be English teacher.\n I have c2 in French and have lived in French speaking environment for a long time. I am thai, but my ancestors are Chinese and British, and I can speak some mandarin. I am thinking about being a French or Thai teacher.\n Do many local people want to learn French or Thai?\n Any suggestions to adapt environment in positive way, job hunting, housing and socializing?\n How do vietnamese think about Thai in general, esp female?

          "description": "I've been wondering about this for a while now...it's late 2023, covid will never be totally gone but much of the world has gotten vaccinated and moved on as the severity of the virus has decreased. \n I don't see too many folks on the streets masking these days, but for some reason it seems really common in high schools - I teach IELTS in high schools in Hanoi, and am surprised that sometimes up to half of my students are still masking. I wonder what the reason is - are they really doing it for health protocol? I can't imagine teenagers are particularly worried about getting sick at this point right? Do their parents make them? My theory is that a lot of young people wear them because it helps self-conscious teens feel \"covered\" and secured a little bit. \n I'm not an anti-masker, these guys can do what they want - just curious why it seems so much more prevalent than in other countries (to be clear, I'm talking about students in a classroom wearing it year-long, not wearing it on the road or because they're sick.)\n    submitted by    /u/bobokeen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nhưng đáp lại sự tôn trọng cuối cùng đó cô ta lại lấy tôi ra để làm trò tiêu khiển bên tên khốn kia. Rồi sau vài lần nói chuyện không thể kết thúc tôi đã gửi những bằng chứng về việc bố H ngoại tình cho mẹ H và mẹ cô ta làm ầm lên rồi li hôn. Chưa cảm thấy thỏa mãn, tôi lại khiến bố cô ta bị bắt vì tội tổ chức đánh bạc và phải ngồi tù 4 năm. Sau 1 năm chia tay, tôi nghe được tin từ vài người bạn chung của 2 đứa về việc cuộc sống cô ta khá tồi tệ khi mà bố đang phải thụ án, mẹ nuôi 2 đứa em và cô ta thì cũng khá tệ. Tôi đã không cảm thấy bất kì điều gì khi tôi nghe những điều đó. \n Đây là câu chuyện thật của bản thân mình nhưng chỉ là vắn tắt, nếu mọi người muốn nghe đầy đủ \"từ tình yêu ngọt ngào đến sự trả thù không hề thương xót\" hãy cmt cho mình biết.\n    submitted by    /u/Lucifer25002  \n [link]   [comments]",

The first task is about 4 pie charts, which took me 25 minutes to finish. The second one is “Some people think that good health is very important to every person, so medical service should not be run by profit-making companies. Do the advantages of private health care outweigh the disadvantages?” I was stunned after reading it, but I still tried my best to complete the essay. When it was done, I counted the words and found out that I wrote just only 200 words, while the task requires to write at least 250 words. But I didn’t have time to add more or look over it, I had to handle it because time was up. I feel really bad now.

They will be working remote every day but will need to give some live presentations so a strong reliable wifi signal is important. \n On the flip side, I wanted to recommend a place where they could also walk to local places for food. Originally I wanted to recommend Hoi An for the experience, but I wouldn't trust the wifi enough (at least not at the bandwidth they'd need). Maybe Da Nang but the hotels that I'd assume would have the best wifi are not near areas that are very walkable and are very touristy. They could visit Hoi An for a half day trip though. Then I was thinking Nha Trang - I remember staying near the water in a modern hotel and could walk down narrow streets to some hidden gems though it was pretty touristy. That was pre-pandemic, maybe they got pushed out...not sure.\n Open to other suggestions (and I'll probably add them to my own itinerary next trip)!\n    submitted by    /u/Biking_dude  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The entire reason why he lived the way he did was because he wanted to be humble and plain. He dressed, ate, and lived like an average farmer, he treated everyone as an equal and he also wanted to be treated as an equal by us as well. So why are we treating him like he's the God Emperor from 40k. For example, we preserve his corpse in something that is almost like a temple. And yet teachers, parents and practically everyone that i talk to compares him to a god. I'm not hating on him, I appreciate his efforts in freeing this country. But I'm confused on why we are treating in the exact opposite way that he wanted to be treated.\n    submitted by    /u/Unavailable-NO1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "American here.\n When visiting to my local barnes and noble recently it was obvious from first glance that a lot of media from Asia is popular. My bookstore shelves are stocked to the brim with Japanese, Korean, even Chinese comics and light novels, figurines, the works. Korean and Japanese pop stars fill the music section, easily holding their own against big western pop stars like Gaga and Bieber.\n But aside from some novels in the young adult section of my bookstore written by Vietnamese Americans, or the usual biographies in the history section discussing the war. There's not a lot of pop culture made by Vietnamese that's popular in the western market as other asian countries. Not a lot of fantasy or horror novels, not a lot of manga, not even the odd pop star. \n You'd think with how much has changed in US-Vietnam relations since the war we'd be seeing more Vietnamese pop culture get exported over here. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Why is that?\n And it's not like Americans are biased against Vietnamese culture because of the war or years of action movies. Far from it. Vietnamese Food is very popular in places like Los Angeles and Toronto, but vietnamese pop culture seems to have fallen completely by the wayside.\n So I'm here to ask for theories on why Vietnamese media isn't as big of a thing in the west as the other nations cultures. And also to ask for recommendations on vietnamese books, movies, tv, manga etc. that I might be interested in?\n    submitted by    /u/Sivilian888010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Veganterian Pho \n Pho\n Pho is a famous dish in Vietnam and I was quite surprised that this dish has a vegetarian version.

          "description": "So i just finished the talking with her family and results were this : I got the call at 7am my time and first i had to ask her if she set me up and her answer was this : Yes I did, i already knew that you were going to marry me i just speed up the process because i don't want to waste more time. She jokingly said that i needed to grow a pair of balls. Back with the talk with her parents their idea we agreed that we are going to get married on paper in home country because she will get my passport. So she will be coming next month so we can do the formalities. I would love to do it in a church but thats just not possible. Second talking point was where are we going to live. I told them about my plans but i was immediately shut down. They told me that it's better to live the first 2 3 years of the childs life near them, the reasoning here is they want to be involved in the upbringing a little bit and because it's their first grandchild. After that they dropped the bomb that they want us to move to Singapore after those 2 3 years. Reasoning for this are plenty but I'll list some important ones : they are opening some offices there and they need someone to manage it and my wife is the candidate, better opportunity and it's not far away from home. I didn't expected this but I call them after i had some time thinking about it. Third was their question of when i will be moving. Told them that if she comes in a month I'll need about 4 months to move. Because it takes some time to move your life. Fourth was the naming. Told them that she and me have an agreement that's if it's boy I'm naming it and if it's a girl she is naming it. My reason here is make continues male and female continues female. \n If you have some questions ask below or comment if you want to hear the full back story\n    submitted by    /u/Fine_Dance_6410  \n [link]   [comments]",

They also ride with super fast speed in sub-urban areas too, which is dangerous for the public's safety where many children or elders are on the streets.

I know the political situation at the time was extremely complex, with all the communist allies infighting, fallout from the end of the Vietnam war and general fear of the Soviets at the time. But the fact that Vietnam pushed all the way to the capital of Cambodia to overthrow one of the most brutal regime in human history, all the while facing pressure not only from the Pro-Chinese countries, but also from the Western Democratic world, is one hell of a tale.

As a monkey i got really excited and did it without thinking of the consequences. Month and half later i get a call with a positive test. I literally froze and the only thing i can think about is getting my shit together. I would like to point out that i don't have a look on this situation as my life is over it's just a natural progression of life that may happened a little earlier. She told me that she hasn't told her parents yet because she wanted to tell me first. We had a serious talk about further progression and when will I move. After the call I immediately talked with my parents because it's a serious shift in my life dynamic and because i need to prepare the funds for the move. The mindset of our parents was already pushing us to get married so we don't have to worry about family disapproval. The only problem here is the sudden switch in our lives. \n So i have a couple of questions: What's the price of land in Hanoi? Planning on building a house Dual citizenship is it possible for all countries? Asking for the kid Is 5 years maximum for visa exemption? How much will I be paying in taxes? \n If you have some questions for me ask me in the comment\n    submitted by    /u/Fine_Dance_6410  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently, I was chatting with my dad about life in general, and the topic of having kids came up. Personally, I'm not too concerned about having children. I know I could be a great dad, but I'd also be perfectly fine without kids. My girlfriend has also hinted that she doesn't want children, and I didn't push the conversation further because either outcome is okay with me.\n When I shared this with my dad, he didn't react well. In fact, he called both of us crazy and said we weren't in our right minds. No matter how much I tried to explain our decision, he kept insisting that I'd change my mind eventually. This really upset me because he wasn't respecting our choice and was trying to influence it.\n I can already see this topic coming up again in the future, and I don't know how to get through to him. I understand that he's getting older and wants grandchildren, which makes it tough because I know how much it would hurt him not to have his own. My older brother is also uncertain about his stance on kids. Any advice on how to handle this?\n    submitted by    /u/YakEvir  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been close to this vietnamese woman. I'm 30 she's 31. She's in a term contract in my laboratory for 1 year. I am an introvert, so does she, and both of us have been single forever. I talk way less than her, and she always talk nonstop with me but not with others. Initially she seems couldn't fit in with my other lab members because language barrier, so I tried to setup a trip with international students in our lab to make her comfortable. We ended up going to a lot of trips, but lately it was just only the both of us and mostly it was her idea. \n We got busier and ended up often having dinner together. From then on I had a crush on her and one day I confess. I was rejected because she want to focus on work and family first, but also because we won't be able to meet for that long and she doesn't want to have a heartbreak from breakup. Strangely, we became even closer than before. Now only a few weeks before she go back to her old lab in another country, she wants me to spend the last day with her and wants to stay together with me and share a room. I am also from SEA, and I don't think this is quite normal, as in sharing a room but not a couple. But she said it is normal in vietnam. Is this true? If you're also a woman, I would like to know what do you think of this.\n Edit: Thank you for the replies. I tried to reply, but because this is a new account, the bot wouldn't let me unless allowed by the actual mods. I don't want to inconvenience the mods each time I want to reply. I am not sure about using my main account. But still, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/ThrowRAlizardman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I’m 29F from Philippines and I am seeing this 30M Vietnamese for quite some time now. We are both professional and worked in the same industry. We are getting to know each other and our relationship is good so far. I’ve been to Vietnam few times already and also tried to stay for few weeks. I really like the food and the people, btw :) and he also visited my country. But the only problem is he cannot see the relationship to progress or lead to marriage because I’m from a different country, culture differences and he is thinking how will his family reacts to our relationship etc. Well, on my end there will be no issues as I think Filipino families are more open to this kind of setup. \n I know for sure that I don’t want to get married, (in near future at least) but of course we also respect and don’t want to waste each other’s time. I do like him and willing to make this relationship to work.\n I just want to ask some insights about this kind or relationship, is it not common or hard to accept in Vietnam? Should I give up? \n I really appreciate your time reading this. Please be kind in the comment section :)\n    submitted by    /u/thatwizardofoz  \n [link]   [comments]",

All my Id are in there, bank cards, the card key for the apartments we are living in. So we try the impossible, going back and forth, looking for my wallet dropped in the street. Phan Xich Long street is crowded, can’t drive back in the same lane, everything seems desperate and futile. We end up driving back till the barber shop I just been before losing the wallet. They went trough a lot of effort helping us, showing us security camera footage of the last hour to check if by any chance I dropped my wallet there. Seem there is nothing more we can do. Suddenly my wife receive a phone call. It was one guy working as security in the street. Thanks to the house card key he found in the wallet he was able to trace back the phone number of my wife. He even makes sure to my wife to show up with me, to avoid a possible landlord to retrieve easy money. Such a thoughtful move. There was my wallet, money untouched. I gave him all I had in the wallet, 2 million dong, and he right away split equally with his partner. I’m happy that this small luck ended up in the hands people in the security, among all others.\n I know how much I was lucky, but still nobody can talk me out of thinking that this could have happen only in this Country. Kudos to all the good people of Vietnam. 🫰\n    submitted by    /u/andcore  \n [link]   [comments]",

The funding for Bowling is garbage compared to other sports, and it is why professional bowlers have a hard time locating a good bowling alley for leagues in Ho Chi Minh City. \n Personally, a good bowling alley must be facilitated with professional-grade equipment (pin setters, scoring system, standard size lanes, balls,...) along with good food/beverage services while being affordable for the young folks. Granted, there may be dozens of bowling alleys popping up on Google, but many of them either lack the qualities mentioned above OR they are closed... permanently. \n In the past year, I have been to many bowling alleys, and I have come up with a curated list of the goats.

Now after 2 weeks living with his family we are traveling to the south, he told me to travel ahead so he could visit yet another family. This way he won't get bored with my touristy stuff and I dont have to sit around all day not being able to talk to the family.\n When we were with his family we made two trips in total, 1 to sapa and one to Ha Long Bay, both times the Hotel tried to rip us off not wanting to give us the rooms we specifically booked or telling us to cancel our reservation to \"check in earlier and get a cheaper price\" we never took the offerm. In Person he could talk to the people in vietnamese and would solve the matter easily in a short time. But now I am alone and the scamming and persistencefrom drivers, sellers and hotel stuff only got worse. Today the hotel refused me to let me check in early even though we have agrees on it online and they have said that it would be no problem. Now when I wanted to check in they told me I could only check in if I cancelled the reservation or I would have to wait 2 hours more. I decided to just straight up wait, to not risk being overcharged without an receip showing the confirmed price from booking.com (many people warn you that that would happen if you cancel the reservation )\n This is my first travel alone/with a friend outside of my own country (Germany) and I don't know what to do, it is really frustrating. Am I being overprotectiv ? Any tips on how to deal with this better would be much appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/ilohi_euw  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I decided to visit Saigon once and twice, and I do believe they're right. I can't speak for the every Saigonese, I know that even for the most progressive cities, there would be people who have problems with gay people. \n But I saw much much much more gay couples walking on the street compared to here in Hanoi. At the last firework show at the countdown thing for lunar new year, I could witness at least 6 gay couples within my eye view, some holding hand and some even had their heads on the other's shoulder, and honestly nobody really gave a shit. …",

          "description": "I've never been in a romantic relationship with anyone in my entire life and I fail to see how this might change in the long run. I personally don't think I would be suitable for any kind of romantic relationship and the mere thought of being forced into / being a part of one makes me feel hopeless and sick. Marriage is obviously out of the question. Having kids also seems to me to be an enormous and exhaustive investment and I would not want to force any potential child to live in this increasingly difficult society without having, you know, their consent.\n However, it's all too common that people from the older generation here tend to think that my position on marriage is simply insane and my parents are no exception. They did not stress much about the fact that I've never cared to have a partner (they think I'm the hot shit and millions of people would die to be wedded to me, which is objectively not the case). But now that I almost finish university and still make no move whatsoever, they constantly bring this topic up and push me to go out into the world and look for someone who would marry me and have my kid. It was kinda heartbreaking to see how badly they want to have grandchildren so I fucked up by telling them that I would marry really late, like at my 40s so that they would stop pestering me about that in the near future (and also once I'm 40s I could tell them that I'm too old for marriage). They got mildly frustrated and forced me to marry 5 years from now, for many reasons.\n People who choose to stay single, what should I do? Because I told them that I would marry late, they now think that marriage is still on the table and all they need to do is to force me to marry way sooner than I'd like. What can I say to them so that they would accept the fact that they would not have grandchildren and that their son would not marry, (and that they and I might get side-eye from relatives because of this decision)?\n I would really appreciate your responses!\n    submitted by    /u/Own_Bike  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everyone I knew told me to be careful with my belonging when I'm there, especially with me having to be extra careful because I'm careless and always walk around using my phone.\n First day in Saigon, I took a bus, and forgot my wallet with all my cash and all kinds of identification papers on there. I was so scared, I couldn't do anything without them, I couldn't even go back home if I wanted to without those papers. I remembered the number of the bus, the number on them showed the route they took, but couldn't remember the exact plate numbers of the specific one I got on. There were many different busses numbered the same. \n I thought it was the end for me. Turned out 1 and a half hour later, I found it sitting still, untouched and intact in the same bus seat I was sitting in, despite being a very crowed day with lots of people in and out of busses. During my time in Saigon, I all walked around the streets with my eyes glued to the phone, because habits. So far, nobody has tried to grab it from me. Maybe the rumors that Saigon is full of petty crime thefts is largely exaggerated?\n But hey, this could simply fall in the case of \"this-has-never-happened-to-me-so-it-must-not-be-true\" fallacy people often use.

We're locked into 17 nights and can't do any longer unfortunately. Would love to hear your recommendations about what you might consider leaving off, and where to possibly spend a bit more time.\n Day 1 – Fly into Saigon. Arrive late so just stay somewhere near the airport.\n Day 2-3 - Fly to Hanoi. Spend 2 nights staying in Old Quarter, visit some sights, food tour etc.\n Day 4 - Spend morning in Hanoi before getting an afternoon bus / limousine to Ha Giang so we can see the views on the way (or should we just get a later bus and spend a few more hours in Hanoi?)\n Day 5-6 - 2 night Ha Giang Loop tour\n Day 7 - Finish Ha Giang Loop and arrive back in Hanoi late\n Day 8 - Do an overnight cruise in La Han Bay\n Day 9-10 - Head to Ninh Binh (Tam Coc) for 2 nights\n Day 11 - Spend day exploring Ninh Binh before getting overnight train to Dong Hoi\n Day 12-13 - Get bus from Dong Hoi to Phong Nha, explore caves and do a single day tour with Oxalis / Jungle Boss\n Day 14 - Get DMZ bus to Hue\n Day 15-17 - Motorcycle ride from Hue to Hoi An via Hai Van Pass, spend 3 nights in Hoi An relaxing / beach time\n Day 18 - Flight from Danang to HCMC before flying out late that night\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Nightgoat91  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I am looking into getting my Vietnamese Passport and am wondering if there is anyone out there similar to me and is familiar with the process.\n I was adopted from Vietnam in 1997, shortly after became a U.S. Citizen with US Passport, etc. My adoptive parents have my original Vietnamese birth certificate and papers, since I was born in Vietnam.\n Is it a tough process to get a Vietnamese Passport? From what I read it seems like as long as I have the correct Vietnamese Paperwork it should just be a submission and waiting period. I would like to have both my US and Vietnamese Passports.

I saw people saying it is recommended to arrive 2–3 hours earlier just in case, and we are fine with that however, this means that we would need to be taking the grab from our Airbnb to the airport probably at 4/5am in the morning. \n My question is, is it safe to take a grab car this early in the morning? We would be in Ho Chi Minh! We just want to have some confirmation that it is indeed safe, as we are both quite young and have never really travelled before.

I had been drinking her Ca Phe Sua Da for years, and I loved it so much I would buy one almost every single day. Unfortunately, she closed the place indefinitely around a month ago, and I have tried many places since.\n The one thing I noticed was I would find the street coffees drastically better than the ones sold in those fancy cafeteria places with ACs and Jazz music playing 24/7. The street Ca Phe Sua Da are sweet, rich, just bitter enough, and their temperature is perfect - not too hot, not too cold. \n It is extremely hard to match the flavor with the one I had been drinking for all these years though. Some places make it too bitter with little sweetness, some make it taste like a milkshake. The \"closest\" one which I kind of enjoy comes from, you guest it, the nice middle-aged lady not too far away from my grandma's home. \n Is there a secret to those street coffees? I want to remake it myself, all those years drinking her coffee and now she closed it, it kinda hurt a little bit :> \n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/jacky2409  \n [link]   [comments]",

And at the kid's pool area, I could notice that it's much harder for me to find a kid being in shape than to find a kid who's not. Almost every little kids I saw carried a big belly with them. There're so many adults who are overweights too.\n I know that one public pool with max of 100 people isn't exactly great of a sample size to draw conclusion for millions of Vietnamese. But it does raise some concern, because in my experience, Vietnamese parents don't really care much about diets, calories and nutrions. They all thought the fatter the kids, the better, and subsequently trying to feed them as much as possible. And if they aren't gaining in size and being underweigh, it's not their \"growing up times\" yet. Fast foods aren't really that popular, I think, so we can't blame it on them\n I was 173cm, 45kg for most of my childhood, throughout my earlier years, my parents and relatives has kept telling I'm not at my \"time\" yet, and kept taking me to doctors and they weirdly said the same, not \"my time\" yet. Turned out at 22 years old, I was still that skinny. It's not until I decided to eat like hell and learn nutrions did I gained 10kg in 2-3 months.

My Vietnamese is pretty good but not good enough to understand what she was trying to pull me over for. I remember my uncle saying something like if they give me a hard time just give them $20. I literally gave her $20 and she’s like no it’s $50. And to shove it discreetly in the drawer for her. I didn’t carry that much cash with me and was planning to withdraw some from the ATM. And I didn’t like how that lady was threatening me so I called my aunt. My aunt told me to ask her for the citation receipt and she said she was trying to help me but we can do it the “hard way” and I have to pay $200 wtf. My aunt wanted to speak to her and she told me to hang up and refused to talk to my aunt and told me I’m a grown adult to take care of it myself. Luckily my aunt knew someone in the airport and he spoke to them and they let me go without paying anything. I wasn’t annoyed they do shady stuff like that, I was annoyed how she spoke to me!\n Edit - I’d also like to point out that scanner lady is a complete moron because she asked for my passport and didn’t flip to the right page with all my info. She pretended to be all official demanding my documentations.\n    submitted by    /u/shockedpikachu123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Like in our daily life we still talk about them with no hate feeling and very neutral. Except for China, China still actively messing with us and have not give up. Even though, our economy is greatly effect, reply on China we aware of them.\n That my perspective as Vietnamese live our daily life. So what other nation is like, because it seems like China still hate Japan, media about Japan and protry Japan as bad where china kick their ass still very popular til today. From Japan media, it seem like Japan still effects by some contract with the US but from some Japanese movie it seem like also protray Japan have their sin. And worst of all is racist thing in America, black still hate white af and still think they are oppressed today. This remind me how different that is in Vietnam, because we also have minority. If you live in some era where you can still see some local people living among us, they look actually very different than the usual Vietnam people, some also have really dark skin and different hair, if you look in too school system there are also advance thing you can get if you are \"Dan toc thieu so\" (Wait a minutes, we too have black people). And if you take a look at history, we totally invaded them local, But we are never have racism or hear of them, Now they are one of us.

The hospital was Bach Mai Hospital, which I heard was one of the best hospitals in the country. It made me more shocked when, even in the best hospital, I heard a lot of people and even one of the doctors talk about how suicidal people should not be allowed to receive treatment. \"Because they want to die anyway.\" they say. It was infuriating because my sister could also hear them. She even commented about it, saying she agreed. She wasn't in her right mind, and it makes me so upset that people could say such a thing in front of a patient. I know Vietnam still wasn't very knowledgeable about mental health, but it wasn't even about that. It's about a person's life; even if they want to take their own life, you are not to treat them differently. It's sickening.\n    submitted by    /u/HealerStandBestStand  \n [link]   [comments]",

We can try to convince them that their way of parenting is wrong but with generations upon generations of trauma and \"tradition brainwashing\" (so to speak), coupled with the lack of Vietnamese language resources, it's really hard for them to realize that the traditional way of parenting is damaging to the mental health of their children.\n So it's up to us the younger generations who are equipped with better knowledge to break the cycle, be more understanding to our children at the same time try to fix our own mental trauma so that we don't fall into the old ways.\n    submitted by    /u/GrapeJam-44-1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm looking at traveling to Northern VietNam (Hanoi) in December. For some context, I live in Canada, will be traveling solo, and am looking at going through a couple weeks. \n  \nAfter doing some research, it seems that one of the biggest challenges is getting around VietNam. Alot of posts say the best way to get around is by motorcycle, however I don't have a motorcycle license nor do I know how to ride a motorcycle. With motorcycle out of the picture, what is the next best way to get around?\n One thing I've found from traveling to other places is you save $$$ when you book tours through the street vendors and not through the airline/travel agency. Are there street vendors in VietNam that you can walk up to and book a tour right then and there, or is it better to book them beforehand? I've seen a few websites selling travel excursions in VietNam.\n Almost all the excursions to Ha Long Bay I've found include an overnight cruise. Being December (one of the worst months for rough seas) and someone who gets sea sick easily, is it possible to go on a boat for a few hours and head back to Hanoi on the same day? Or is it better to spend the night somewhere around Ha Long Bay?\n What would be a good way to get to Sa Pa? Google says it's ~5 hours by car and ~7 hours by train. Similar to Ha Long Bay, is it recommended/possible to stay in Sa Pa overnight?\n Any other recommendations?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/ub3rst4r  \n [link]   [comments]",

I mean, Vietnam, or any Asian country for that matter, is heavily affected by Korea entertainment industry. Korea, in itself, is a kingdom and trend-setter in terms of entertainment and beauty, it's no doubt we are somewhat influenced by them. Most of our hairstyles, or fashion styles, right now follows what's trendy in Korea, which would affect what Vietnamese choose to wear and what clothes are produced and promoted for men fashion. \n I've heard Vietnamese men complaining complaining endlessly on Facebook too, wondering why women likes such girly boys. But I think if they don't have any appeal at all to women, they won't be that successful and loved. Maybe what men thinks women find attractive is drastically different than what women actually find attractive.\n For me, as a gay men and somewhat masculine, I find half of them very pleasing to the eyes, very \"pretty\", the other half too effeminate for my taste. They are \"beautiful\", but not \"hot.\" But it depends on which idol though, some has a perfect blend of masculinity and feminity, of handsomeness and gracefulness that makes them hotter than any 6-packs Western bros.\n Do Vietnamese men like the image of male K-pop idols?\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate-Bit9246  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've never understood people's obsession with having a son, a male heir. My father, for example, abandoned his previous wives because they couldn't bring him a son. It was not until my mother, and not until having 5 daughters prior to having me, did he have a son.\n But sadly, that son, which is me, is gay. Don't you think it's ironic? The way my father was obsessed with having a son, and he turned out to be gay? I guess it's his karma. Never mind, he abandoned my mother too and he has never existed to me in my mind.\n It's just that a family in my neighborhood, who are really poor, they have three young daughters already and they're still pushing for another one in hope it's a boy. Watching the mother with a big belly and three daughters already barely having enough to eat and study pains my heart. \n Why the obsession with having to have a boy? Um, he could be gay, you know? He could be a transgender. He could die young? He could be a drug addict and a failure, in which case you must have 3 or 4 sons in case then?\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate-Bit9246  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the midst of crazy public holiday traffic last night I jumped out of a Grab when I could not knowing my phone slipped from me while doing so, and by the time I realised and ran back he was gone. As a solo traveller it was daunting to think what I should do and what I couldn't do without my phone. Trying not to panic, I went to the nearby security guard of a mall. He understood the gist of what I said and took me to the mall information desk. Now, I assumed in the crowded noisy and busy place they would just wave me away and say go to the police station or something. But they jumped into action, got my details and number (thank f*** I had my Vietnam phone number written down seperately on hand), took my photo and messaged security to go over CCTV to try to get the car plate number, let me use their phone to see if I could get any Grab details from my email, and kept calling my phone when they could. \n The CCTV couldn't get a plate number. I feared the driver wouldn't hear my phone or would just keep it, but eventually the driver answers. He had finished for the day but would drive back, although it would take time with all the traffic. I expected he would want a compensation for time and fuel and honesty, but when he eventually arrived he refused the cash in my hand. I made him accept a bag of those holiday moon cake things the mall was selling as a thank you, and I also went back and bought a couple for the information desk ladies afterwards. \n This is a simple faith in humanity restored post because I feared the worst and was touched by how much they cared, especially at such a busy working time for them, for some tourist. Caring for others makes a difference.\n    submitted by    /u/foln1  \n [link]   [comments]",
