Some people even complain that students in Vietnam study way less than in China, South Korea, therefore students should not complain about the current system being too hard, saying the countries mentioned above got better economy and more \"prodigies\" thanks to East Asian education. But they barely see the fact that both China and SK got rich thanks to the technology transfer from the west while Vietnam has little to none.

Funny thing is that we are the only people in the area that actually walk our dog on a leash, and we carry bags to pick up our dog's shit, you know, like educated members of any normal society. We even explain this to people, but their too fucking stupid to care.\n It's not even the same person, it's like everyday some idiot feels the urge to yell at us or start jumping and rushing our dog to scare it. Side note: our young dog was abused by Vietnamese people (and small children) and left alone and sick in the street as a puppy and does not like being approached like that. \n Our dog wasn't doing anything tonight and some woman started berating us and saying she'd call the police because she assumed we were making our dog shit on the side walk. She was full blown psychotic and her fucking 6-7 year old kid was just standing there watching his mother act like a wild animal.

U cannot enter or leave Ha Giang without getting controlled, we also got controlled at 11pm in ha giang and 6.30am a few Km away! If you don't want to pay that fine, get a bus to Don Vang and rent a bike from there. U will get the best views of the whole loop and there is no police checks at all! Its just around Ha Giang!!

          "description": "Dear people of color \n My post is based on multiple trips to multiple cities in Vietnam \n I have to warn you that if you are solo traveling through Vietnam and you have a dark skin,in my experience when you come to Saigon and Hoi An expect to be ostracised by many of the service staff in the tourist friendly restuarants and shops in these places .\n In these two cities you will be treated with disdain by large proportions of tourist service staff who are very clear in their distaste at serving you . The complete difference in the way dark skinned people are ostracised and white skinned tourists were fawned over in the same place by the same staff is the most consistently racist experience I have had in my travels to 30 different countries . \n In other accounts on Reddit people have spoken of how they spent their entire holidays in their hotel room to avoid such unpleasant ostracisation \n However in Hanoi and Danang and Dalat I have received much more kindness from ordinary Vietnamese so I suspect this overt dark skin ostracism is a phenomenon localized to certain parts of Vietnam . \n Of course looking at the tons of posts on this topic ,I assume people will offer tons of reasons for discrimination.and they would suggest you suck it up . You don't have to listen to those kind white skinned people on this forum who assure you the Vietnamese can't be racist bcos they fawn over white skinned people like gods .\n If you are a POC i don't think you need to waste your hard earned cash to be ostracised \n I suggest if you do come to Vietnam in my experience I found in Danang or Hanoi or Dalat the people don't appear so ready to ostracise customers with dark skin\n Or if you prefer less ostracism with your coffee go to Thailand or Laos where they don't openly ostracise innocent strangers for the color of their skin \n  \n [link]   [comments]",

After finishing viewing a juggling/circus performance outside a building in the Chinese village, the guide said that people were invited inside for an additional show, requiring a separate ticket, called “the beauties” and that this show was only able to be viewed by people over the age of 18.\n We have two very small children so didn’t go, but my partner and I spent a lot of time wondering what would make a show at a theme park like this adults only? Some ideas we had\n  \nit may involve offering guests shots of alcohol. But we’ve been to shows like this before with kids- they just don’t give the kids alcohol\n \nmaybe it involves playing games with the “beauties” which may be leaning towards gambling\n \nthere may be some jokes or references which aren’t suitable for children. But I would expect references would have to be pretty mature to only be suitable for 18 year olds instead of say 16 year olds. \n \nsomeone is getting naked. Which would be odd for a theme park, but a 18+ show in a theme park is already pretty weird. \n \n So, anyone has any clue of what was making this an adult only production? \n Tl:dr- an otherwise family friendly theme park in Hoi Anh has an adult only show- curious as to what makes it 18+\n    submitted by    /u/WatchAndFern  \n [link]   [comments]",

They aren’t painful or itchy so I have no idea what they could be from. The only bugs I noticed in our Airbnb were what I think are plaster bugworms. It’s pretty warm weather right now so that could be a factor. It’s also not acne or anything like that. When I visited in 2019, I had this issue but there were fire ants in the hotel so I figured that was where they came from. Anyone know what might be the cause?\n    submitted by    /u/AsideCompetitive7435  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I did mentioned that prior to the booking but he kept on reassuring me that it is fine) but my gut instinct said I should cancel so I did. He won’t let me cancel, tried to call me multiple times but I insisted and he confirmed it. (I did try to rebook with another cruise that I like but his price were 1m higher than what he told us)\n The morning after (today) I found a lot of bad review on Google which confirmed my suspicions. And then I got the call from the driver to come and pick us up which I find kinda weird since I already canceled it, he then call me multiple times, then told someone else to call me and beg me to go on the cruise.\n He then continued to threaten me saying that he will send someone to collect the rest of the money, and said that I should never come back to Vietnam. \n Question: What should I do? I did tried to contact the embassy. They told me to contact the local police but will they really help?

I don't know exactly what it is but I'm certain they're selling dumplings or something \"bánh bao!\". Anyways, it's driving me absolutely insane. I'm staying in the 8th floor of a hotel and I hear it literally all day/night. They go until 2am sometimes. Not only is it loud, but the FREQUENCY at which it is coming out of the speakers is enough to drive someone mad.

I've got a question for those who have purchased a scooter or motorcycle here as a foreigner.\n My understanding is that when you purchase a bike you receive the Blue Card for the vehicle.

I've heard mandatory insurance is available at gas stations and is affordable. But say worst case scenario, I hit and injure a pedestrian or other driver... What happens?

We were talking every week and almost everyday. She is an active viet girl who do a lot of sports but recently, she stopped doing ice skating because her health kinda declined in few weeks at the beginning of 2024. She showed me that her Apple Watch detected 2 times AFib. I told her to see a doctor but she didn’t because she was waiting for her new ID card. \n In the night Saturday night of this weekend. Her father was apparently drunk and her parents was arguing kinda violently as she told me. She said that she was kinda scared. I had to go on Paris at the same time, I told her to try to calm down and all. And I moved out of my house. The next day I sent a message to see if everything was alright but she didn’t responded or saw my message. I sent few messages to her on Discord or iMessage to ask if she was safe, but no response. I have her Apple health informations in real time on my iPhone, yesterday she walked only 90 meters and only 550 meters on Sunday. She apparently doesn’t wear her Apple Watch since 3 days :/ So I can’t see her heart informations. \n I’m worried that anything happened to her.

          "description": "I don't understand why a lot of people here like alcohol so much. I feel sick when drinking alcohol; your head goes numb, sometimes leading to a bad headache. You cannot drive any vehicle, and your stomach gets twisted and turns upside down. It's really bad for your health. Most of the stuff people drink is low quality, and the container for the drink is literally a gasoline can.\n With close family, I can get away with drinking less, but in the workplace, there is a lot of pressure to drink. It's considered very disrespectful if you decline a drink offer or if you don't offer a drink to an elder/senior. You will be considered the outcast, the weirdo of society; you have to drink to earn a little respect. I hate that the cons of not drinking outweigh the cons of drinking even it can lead to greater danger to life.\n I understand the experience of sharing good food or singing karaoke, partying with people, but why do you need alcohol? After being drunk, I make no progress at work or for myself; I'm just stuck in bed, wasting my life. Maybe I am a big snowflake, but alcohol, to me, is the devil's drink, and I still don't get it. Sorry if this post is too much ranting from me.\n What is your experience with drinking in Vietnam?\n https://preview.redd.it/8kb1m59v7ifc1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f24ea40a5b3faa0e705d3a8007c60f3a7c94542\n    submitted by    /u/Skytheslash  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hanoi/Halong Itinerary with young kids and elderly\n Hi All, I cannot find the answer anywhere after scouring the internet…\n We have some elderly and some toddlers on this trip to Vietnam coming up. One of the elders speaks Vietnamese so hopefully we can get by OK. But I gotta do all planning. My questions regarding this trip:\n 1) We plan for 3 nights in Hanoi area with a Halong Bay cruise and Ninh Binh (maybe?) tour. I’ve read anything from just booking onsite with hotel to planning ahead online and avoiding scams. What to do with the large family group like this? \n 2) Overnight or day cruise to Halong Bay with kids and 80 yr olds? I imagine we will stay in Hanoi on the first night and head out to Halong the next morning. However, I am reading a lot about these tour operators who extend the drive from Hanoi to about 3 hrs by stopping by some random vendors like pearl shops. Don’t want to do this with kids if we can cut down drive time to about 2 hrs. I also don’t love the idea of staying overnight in a boat but it might be less tiring than a roundtrip drive in one day. \n 3) Do you book your stay in Hanoi and come back to the same hotel after Halong cruise (ie if you’re doing an overnight) or do you lug all your stuff with you?\n 4) Ninh Binh doable with really young kids in this time span? I realize the trip is super short though I hear it’s worth visiting. \n 5) We are headed to Nha Trang after Halong Bay (or Ninh Binh). Ideally Halong Bay > Haiphong airport is a shorter route to get to Nha Trang airport so we don’t have to go all the way back to Hanoi. But it seems only Vietjet operates direct flights at this airport whereas we prefer VN airlines where Hanoi would have flights. Wondering if I should consider the smaller airport close to Halong to avoid the round trip drive back to Hanoi. \n 6) Any other suggestions with little kids such as just hiring a private driver/shuttle vs tour groups. \n Thanks!!!\n    submitted by    /u/boxybiscuit  \n [link]   [comments]",

We already have hotels/bnbs booked but I’m just wondering if bus travel should be secured ahead of time or if it’s relatively easy once we’re there. Starting in Hanoi then heading to Halong Bay.

          "description": "Hi,\n Since our time in Vietnam we have found that the locals have been trying to scam us in numerous ways, such as buses not arriving at the actual bus station and dropping us 5km outside of the designated bus stop at 3am where a local taxi driver is waiting. (Charging 500k for a 5km journey) to our hotel, which was beside the actual bus stop we were supposed to be dropped at. \n Our driver made a call on the way to the hotel and when we arrived the hotel was shut. We have literally discussed our early/ late arrival with the hotel but now they had the door and cover shut. (Like it had been abandoned)\n Luckily our taxi driver, who just happened to know where the bus would drop us, and made a call just before dropping us to the hotel, knew of another hotel. He dropped us to this small dingy homestay where he clearly knew the owner and we paid 700k dong for a disgusting room which was not worth 200k dong.\n When we were in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, obviously you had people trying to make a few extra dollars from you, but never so orchestrated as in Vietnam where there seems to be an actual system in place.\n I am just curious, as an Irish person, I would hate to see this happen to Vietnamese tourists coming to our country and would be sure to voice up for it to stop, nor would our local community.\n What are Vietnamese people's thoughts on this ? Does it bother you or do you all enjoy trying to extract as much money as possible from people visiting your country ?\n    submitted by    /u/CONATY93  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m sure many of you studied English in school, but was that sufficient to get you to the level you’re at now? For me, school provided a 'logical' understanding of the language. However, I found it challenging to comprehend native speakers because the English taught in textbooks differs significantly from spoken English, and the accents of public school teachers aren’t always perfect.\n Upon finishing school, I struggled to watch videos or movies in English, even though I could somewhat manage reading textbooks - albeit with some effort. There came a point when my favorite show stopped being subtitled in Vietnamese, forcing me to watch it with English subtitles.\n Initially, it was difficult, and I didn’t understand much. But over time, things started to make sense, before I knew it, my YouTube feed had become entirely English - primarily due to the lack of useful content in Vietnamese. The auto subtitle feature of youtube came out around that time so that was super useful too.\n TL;DR: School gave me a foundation in English, but only after watching and reading a lot of English content does it click for me.\n    submitted by    /u/IHateMacWithAPassion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys 🫡, this is the first time I've used this function in an app (weirdly???), so I think a lot about the topic that I can discuss with guys. Finally, I wonder why dont i share about schoolwork or daily days. So that reason I'm here. Not rambling more, today I will talk about my ambition of schoolwork. I'm a normal student in my public school which I tried my best to enroll in (it is one of the best in my province). Therefore, when I study there, I try a lot to \"catch the life melody\". I'm not the type of smart person, the achievement I got is my diligence every single day. In the first year of the class in this school, I studied a lot to be an excellent student (I'm studying a new curriculum, so 9.0 average for 6 subjects to be an excellent student) but I can not. That time, I was so disappointed in myself, because I struggled with studying very much. Fortunately, I learned that studying too much does not mean getting high marks or good results, I have to study effectively, study smarter, and focus on the main lesson/idea in that subject. And u know what, by my efforts and belief in myself, finally the second-year class I got it * That was so amazing!!(^)* I was cheerful when I got praise perk. At that moment, I was so satisfied with my performance academic. Currently, I don't know why but I wanna get higher achievements than now, no longer satisfied with myself. Moreover, I wanna join some activities in school such as dancing, clubs, and more interesting things. As a result, sometimes I burn out, exhausted but I receive new experiences, and worthwhile memories with my friends. 🤔Do you think that when we are young or students we should try our best to achieve the best result? And the ambition like me, is it right?\n Btw, my English is not good, so I hope everyone can sympathize with me😇. Thanks a lot😘\n    submitted by    /u/InternationalGoat147  \n [link]   [comments]",

After the accident a traffic policeman/detective went to the hospital I was in to ask some questions to my Vietnamese coworkers visiting me.\n One of my coworkers told me he wanted to check my messaging history on my phone (I have no idea why). They refused to let him access that.\n After being discharged at the hospital, I went to the police station to meet the other driver I crashed with and fully compensated him for the damages of his car (he didn't suffer any injuries) and we both signed a document to cease any legal case caused by the accident.\n Yesterday I went again to the transit police station to pay for the fines related to the accident while I was driving my motorbike. The policeman gave me a document so I was able to collect back my motorbike after I paid everything. After leaving the police station he texted me on Zalo to ask about the identity card and one more document of one of my coworkers (specifically, the one who refused to show him my chats). Again, I have no idea why he needs that.\n At this point I want to cease any contact with the police since I already compensated the other driver and paid the fines related to the accident.\n Do I have any legal obligation to reply to the policeman who keeps texting me on Zalo? Should I stop replying to his messages and get a lawyer in case they require more documents in the future?\n I'm starting to feel paranoid about the whole situation.\n Any help is appreciated.

We're definitely doing Pu Luong for 1 night and Ha Long Bay for 1 night but not sure where to add the extra night between Pu Luong and Cat Ba. We're also going to Hanoi and Ninh Binh for multiple nights but this the part of the trip where we're undecided still so any advice much would be much appreciated.\n Here are my thoughts: \n  \nIf we do 1 day in Ha Long Bay, we'll only do a 1 day cruise and skip Cat Ba. If we do 2 days, we'll do 1 day cruise and 1 day Cat Ba and rent a scooter to explore the island. Hearing mixed reviews on this part of the trip so wondering if 1 day cruise is enough. \n I know this won't be peak time of year for rice fields in Pu Luong but it looks like a beautiful, less touristy area which is appealing since I expect the other locations to be crowded. 1 day will be pretty rushed but also not sure how much there is to see. \n  \nI have no idea what to expect in either place outside of some Google images and reddit posts but if anyone has been to both places – especially in this time of year – it would be awesome to get your thoughts. \n    submitted by    /u/thebeesknees210  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently had a fall and hurt my foot, which got worse over a few days. I went to hospital today under the advice of my hotel, and they have been nothing short of amazing. The manager came with me to help with translating, waited 2 hrs in hospital with me before going home to her family. One of the bus boys gave me his arm to lean on accompanying me to the taxi and was ready waiting for me when I returned. A third one followed holding an umbrella over my head. All these kind gestures made my experience that much easier, and I wanted to thank them. I'd love to leave them separate tips, without digging too deep in my budget but without offending them either ... What do you think is a good sum to tip in this situation?

N asked me to send her 100$ for her gift because i already somewhat trusted N so i send her the money after a while i asked to meet her but she kept asking for more money and being a stupid 19 years old,I send her total 800-900$ ish im not sure around 18mil,then around 3 months talking i found out she was also talking to this singapore guy for nearly 2-3 years and he told me he had plan to come to vietnam to meet her and he also was sending her money which is crazy and idk how much men she had tricked (if you guys are in similar situation or needed more info d/m me)i had kept this secret for so long because it was so stupid and tbh really embarrassing to even tell anyone. p/s:my “friends” that was her cousin told me later on after i told him about her he said they werent that close and she is on his mom family side so before any of you guys said she is catfish ect and tbh with you guys she might be tho,cause she give me her friends bank account everytime i transferred her the money,this is the most dumbest thing i have ever done and idk what’s wrong with me at that moment.I just want to get this off my chest\n    submitted by    /u/ItsDefinitelyNotKris  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently have two full days and nights in Ho Chi Minh City and was trying to sneak a day to fly over to Hanoi and check it out, really just to say I saw it, but I would say Ho Chi Minh City appeals to me more. Is it worth taking the flight over to see the city or should I just book an extra day in Ho Chi Minh City to see it more completely?\n I might not be back in the area for five to ten years.\n I realize a lot of people will want to reply with something like \"It all depends on you\" and \"We can't know what you enjoy\" type comments, but please refrain from those. It's obvious that everyone is different and the right decision for one is not the right decision for another. I guess I'm really just asking if a third day in Ho Chi Minh will be more productive and fun than trying to squeeze whatever I can out of Hanoi in 15 waking hours or so.\n    submitted by    /u/IAmBillN  \n [link]   [comments]",

My entire family each has a way to verbally and mentally abuse me but my granddad is by far the worst. He would say things like “you’ll wait till I’m dead then you’d come visit? You ungrateful, disgraceful, uneducated child”, or “why don’t you f**k off and never come back” etc. These episode would last for at least 2-4 hours and he won’t let me leave the room or if it’s a phone call, he’ll cuss me out and hang up without saying anything else. \n My mom would force me to endure these episodes because “you owe them your life. Who do you think give us money to raise you”. And my dad is just passive aggressive saying things like “it’s fine con, no need to come back and visit us”. And my sister on the other hand is so worried about the inheritance that she’s yelling at me how the West (I’m from the US) has ruined me and my values are killing our chances for a good share of inheritance… I’m just so lost and hurt and I truly don’t want to go back at all.

Ghi rồi quên, nhưng lâu lâu sẽ lục lại để nhìn về quá khứ.\n Ừm thì, tui tốt nghiệp BK, đi làm kỹ thuật được 1 năm. Cộng với tiền học bổng, tui đi làm thì để dành được 130tr. Tui không đi chơi, ăn uống thì ở nhà. Với tui, đó là một số tiền tiết kiệm kha khá để khởi nghiệp :)\n Nhưng mà khổ một nỗi, sự việc ấy đã đến vào 25/04/2023. Chuyện xảy ra 2 tuần sau khi chia tay bồ. Lúc đó, tui khá trầm cảm. Do lần đầu có người yêu, nên chia tay với tui là cú sốc tâm lý. Bây giờ nghĩ lại, không biết tui quăng tiền vào là vì chia tay rồi nghĩ quẩn, hay thực sự là tui quá non. Dù sao đi nữa, tui cũng ngu như bò.\n Mọi chuyện bắt đầu từ một cuốc điện thoại, rồi qua Zalo, rồi qua Telegram. Trên Telegram, tui nhắn tin với tài khoản NVHD_DUYTUNG. Hắn tự gọi mình là người hướng dẫn và chỉ cách kiếm tiền.\n Bước đầu tiên, hắn cho tui vào nhóm và làm nhiệm vụ. Yêu cầu cũng khá đơn giản. Vào trang web tv360, like bộ phim được chỉ định và chụp lại làm bằng chứng. Mỗi nhiệm vụ được 15000₫, và tui làm được 4 lần. Thế là có 60000₫ bỏ túi. Hay vờ lờ.\n Nhưng mà nhiệm vụ thứ 5 thì khác. Lần này là nhiệm vụ ăn tiền. Chúng nó cho tôi vào một nhóm nhỏ gồm 3 người (tay trong hết). Sau đó, tôi được tạo tài khoản trên trang web chúng nó và bắt đầu chơi tài xỉu. Thề với anh em, trước khi lên đồn trình báo, tôi còn méo biết tôi đang thuộc diện đánh bạc :)\n Nên thôi, anh em rút kinh nghiệm xương máu từ thằng ngu này nhé.\n    submitted by    /u/massive_buttocks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was looking at a lot of islands by Ha Long and was interested there. I am looking for somewhere with nice water, beaches, and access to city as well. Also, since we are students we would like to minimize the cost as much as possible. So if anyone has any suggestions for cheapest ways to travel to and in vietnam that would be great. Also, how does the currency exchange work? Roughly how much will it cost to eat and do activities in vietnam for 5 days? If anybody can answer even some of my questions and give recommendations that would be amazing.\n ​\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Asier559  \n [link]   [comments]",

How can I hold them accountable and give me an update? \n I know I definitely qualify, and the guy I spoke to last said they are working on it, but that was in September.

          "description": "I am a female backpacker and have been travelling through Vietnam for a few weeks (I have been to Ha Noi, HCMC and Nha Trang so far). I am overweight and in my research about the country I learnt in advance that the topic of weight comes up very often and that the cultural approach to the topic is very different than for example in europe where I come from. Now it has actually happened to me many times here that I have been asked about my weight or have been pressurised by strange men to get on a scale etc., but as I have already anticipated this, I try not to be too hurt and just let it pass me by. However, I haven't had a single really friendly encounter in Vietnam so far and I'm really starting to wonder whether it's because of my weight that I'm being treated more disrespectfully? I'm a very polite person and try to smile a lot and always say please, thank you, hello and goodbye but I never get a reply and hardly anyone speaks to me for more than two words (unless it's about my weight). \n As I am travelling alone, the experience of being here feels very lonely and sad and I wonder if I can change anything personally or if it really is my appearance?\n Edit: as I think it's important. I am really overweight like 40kg too much. Not like 10kg and just a bit more chubby.\n    submitted by    /u/EnvironmentalSlip861  \n [link]   [comments]",

She is very westernised in the sense of liberal thought, accent etc, however her parents are very traditional. I am from a non-Vietnamese background. \n She had recently divorced her husband who is Vietnamese. They had an 8 year old son. I also have a son of the same age. Early in the relationship, her ex-husband would come around to her apartment when I was there for the custody change over. She asked me to ‘hide’ in her room so that he would not see me. She claimed that he was still talking to her mother and would tell her she has a boyfriend. \n I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but this continued for months. I never met her parents. She told me this was ‘cultural’ and her mother would come around eventually. \n I made to the mistake of meeting up with her on an overseas trip to the US which she had taken with her sister, to meet up with their cousins. I was told that I had to meet her in a neutral location, as I could not see the cousins because her mother had told them that she was still married. During this trip she broke up with me. We got back together a few times, but this issue continued and caused a lot of issues. Eventually, she broke up with me by text message after 3 years of emotional investment and me hoping things would change.

They’ll pour you free tea of any kind, and tell you about Vietnamese culture and tea.\n Chà Trà Tea Room - 5 Ngõ 73 Giang Văn Minh, Đội Cấn, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam\n Long story - We wandered in this alley and discovered this tea house. They immediately welcomed us. It was the brother of the owner and a local guest, drinking tea. The place looks like a museum, displaying about a hundred of handmade teapots, which are the owner’s collection. \n They offered us to take a seat, and started brewing tea for us, and it was delicious. Then they offered me to seat in the brewer’s place, with all the equipment and asked me to try brew some tea, teaching me the ceremony procedure. Then the owner’s son approached, and he could speak English so he started translating and telling us about the history of the store, the teas, etc, asking us about our travelling, our country. It felt so warm, welcoming, it was the highest level of hospitality. Then they brought also boiled corn, while changing teas and brewing more and more. They didn’t ask or accept a penny, and said that drinking tea there is free for anyone. Afterwards the Owner (the dad), his wife, and his friend ( some national tea expert) came. They started making even more tea, that tasted too good to be true. The dad started telling us about the tea culture in Vietnam, about their hospitality, healing properties of the teas, the soul component, it was genuinely wonderful and exciting. Almost 3 hours flew by in a blink. We got to buy a pu-erh cake that is made with tea between 200-500 years old. \n The interior is really cozy, and the atmosphere is so tranquil and peaceful. We loved it, and i think that it should be much much much more popular. Their family is wonderful and made us feel like home!\n    submitted by    /u/whlatislovee  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a backpacker travelling Vietnam on a scooter alone, so after arriving to Nha Trang in the evening I checked into my hostel, had dinner and then decided to go for a short walk.\n I went into a electronics store, didn't buy anything and then further along my walk bought a donut from a bakery street vendor. By this point its about 9pm and I turn onto a street lined with cafe's on one side busy with people sitting outside. For reference I was approximately here https://goo.gl/maps/9nZTxkBiGEX414Jg6\n Suddenly an asian man on a motorbike stops 5m in front of me and shouts something towards me in a language I don't recognise as he dismounts.

I ran into someone this morning while riding my motorbike, and they claimed I hit their motorbike and demanded 100,000 to get it fixed. They forced me to brake as they rode ahead of me. Although I was a little apprehensive, I offered them 200,000 to solve the situation and asked for change because I didn't want to get into any difficulty(lmao I'm that naive). I also believed that I had struck their motorbike. But after taking a peek at my wallet and realizing I had a lot of cash, they demanded more. Now that I knew they were trying to scam me, I seized the opportunity to \"steal\" my 200,000 and fled as quickly as possible. \n They looked so gangster-like that I believed I had somehow lost my sense of reason. Oh and they did that on a crowd street too.\n    submitted by    /u/ScaredRecover9405  \n [link]   [comments]",

They would claim the government required this to report us to the local establishment. We had one bad incident where the hotel has bugs and we requested to leave immediately, but they would not give us our passports until we paid them (even though we didn't stay more than an hour). \n Is this still a standard practice? To clarify, we did stay at local establishments, not corporate companies, like Hilton. First, we had concerns if we would even get our passports back, and our other concern was if something should happen while we were exploring that we would need it.

          "description": "i feel like my grandparents and parents always idolized and romanticized france because they grew up around the end of the colonial period. they had to go to french catholic school and learn the language as children, and were surrounded by pieces of french culture. they were boat ppl but always retained that small connection to french things even if we are 0% french. they always bring up how they had a french education or that they know certain things about france, some of my family members are almost obsessed with it (always talking about how they know something about french food or fashion, insisting that we must pronounce it the “french way” even though we don’t speak french and have never been there). we are probably like 6-12% chinese, but they all seem to have a strong dislike for chinese culture and do not embrace it the way they embrace france, even though we have literally zero ties to the french. is this normal among any older people in the diaspora? how do most viets nowadays abroad or in VN view french/france?\n    submitted by    /u/Training_Molasses_24  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I will be 23 soon this year. I am trying to decide if I should try for Peace Corp in VN (that is if I get accepted/I pass the medical exams), or try for TEFL.I am trying to see if I should try applying for Peace Corp in VN or just do TEFL in Vietnam. I am currently doing an English teaching volunteer experience as of now (soon I might get a temporary teacher's assistant position), graduated already with a bachelors and have a TEFL cert. My Vietnamese is at A2 (heritage speaker) and I am working to improve it.\n My goals is to see more of the culture in everyday life and learn more of the language. I am unsure of the pros and cons to either option. That being said I would like to do Peace Corp at some point in my life. Either way I would need to save up it turns out when the VN cohort leaves is approximately around the same time I plan to leave.I see that by the time of this year, I will probably be at a low B1.\n My main concerns are really if I would be able to learn the language to around B2/C1 by the end of the two years (plans are to continue taking classes and studying, as well as using the language as much as I can). I did post in the TEFL and peace corp subreddits but I wanted to get some perspectives. I was recommended by a user on r/expats to post here too.\n Originally my plan is if I get accepted to Peace Corp in VN (assuming I get accepted and pass the medical/legal exams) and I go, I would do it for the entire duration and then evaluate. If not, I would do TEFL for two years and then evaluate. Right now I graduated but I haven't found anything in my field and I figured I might as well get my Vietnamese to advanced since that is what I wanted to do since I was a kid. I could go back to the States and do a different career afterwards, sure I would be setback but I don't have much to lose.\n I would also like to see if anyone has experience doing either TEFL or Peace Corp or something similar to what I am wanting to do.\n    submitted by    /u/throwaway_071478  \n [link]   [comments]",

He has an estranged son (none of us know him or are in contact with him) and while my other uncles and mom was handling the death certificate, the US consulate was able to get a hold of his son. Unfortunately his son considered some options verbally but stopped responding, so there’s nothing in writing. There is no will. My uncle also has no assets.\n We have the means (and want to) bury him as we have a family cemetery in VN. It seems like my parents and other uncles couldn’t get permission to move forward with the burial. How does next of kin responsibilities work? Can’t they just keep going down the line of kin if the first one doesn’t take action? I’m just sad that his body is stuck at the hospital indefinitely and none of us can get closure.\n I also don’t want my family to get in trouble if they attempt to get the body from the hospital.

          "description": "My family member and I want to travel to Europe. We have been saving up money for a one-week tour, perhaps via Vietravel. We have often been told that it's not possible for those who haven't traveled to any other countries to apply for a Schengen visa. While we can afford to travel for one week in Europe, we do not have enough funds to visit other nearby countries beforehand. I believe that as long as we have proper documentation, can prove that we have enough budget to finance our trip, and have a well-prepared travel plan - in this case, it's on the tour agency's side - we will be able to obtain a travel visa. But, is that not enough?\n Thank you in advance.\n edit: What if I only have one year left till my passport expires? If I travel to several SEA countries this year, get a new passport next year, do my past travels still count?\n    submitted by    /u/Explorer_XZ  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's the hospital, so most of the people there tend to be older, like 50 and above\n And they always cut the line no matter what they do. I was waiting for my turn for an X-ray, and I could see grandpas trying to cut the line, storming into the doctor's office trying to get the service they want despite seeing lines of other people waiting, just for them to be politely asked to get out and get in line.\n At the cashier, it was even worse, everyone was like all trampling all over each other, trying to squeeze against each other in order to be the one that got the service first. It frustrated me so much because I was like, what was the hurry? Just wait in a goddamn line. Waiting in line wouldn't even work because someone would always try to cut it, and they wouldn't even care that they hit many people in the course of doing so.\n And don't even make me start with the bus. They always must be the one who gets in first and got the best seat even if it causes some jamming. \n I see this type of behaviour much more often in our older generation, like 50 and above, than our younger counterpart.\n Do you guys notice the same thing too, or is it just the people where I live?\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Arugula6148  \n [link]   [comments]",

They immigrated to America when they were in their early 20s, so I was born and raised there. My mom's talking to our cab driver about how much Vietnam has changed then as well as the cultural and value differences between the two countries. Specifically their conversation about family values had me in tears. I knew that Vietnamese culture has a very heavy emphasis on family. Most times, you got whole generations living in the same house. Everybody is constantly supporting and looking after one another like parents will provide for their kids regardless of their age. Similarly, even after the children are all grown up, they stay behind to take care of their family. However, American family values is not like that. Sure children love their parents, but they're quick to move on and live their life as soon as they're able to support themselves. Which I would say is true. Lot of kids try to move out as soon as they hit 18 which is considered a transition to adulthood. I think a good amount of them will use college as their escape from home. My brothers and I all have goals to move out, start our own careers/lives as soon as we're able to, and she's expecting to probably go to a nursing home when she's unable to take care of herself. I just honestly feel so guilty and sad that she feels like that. Of course I want to be able to take care of my parents. I don't want to stick them in the nursing home but at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in the same place until it's my parents' time.

On the other hand, I notice much more diverse clientele at, Italian, Japanese, Thai, and (westernized) Chinese restaurants. When I lived in Australia, however, there were a lot more non-Asians eating in Vietnamese restaurants.\n For Australia, I know that Vietnamese have a longer history there than in New Zealand, and people are thus much more familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, but I still found it interesting how Vietnamese food seemed to be proportionately more popular among non-Asians in Australia than among non-Asians in New Zealand, despite the fact that Australia and New Zealand are neighboring countries.\n So, out of curiosity, at Vietnamese restaurants in Vietnam and other countries, how popular are they among non-Asians?

I was thinking to rent a car for the four of us to be able to travel from city to city to avoid taking the train/bus as I wanted us to be able to travel on our own time and not be at the whim of bus/train schedules as well as be able to make pit stops and enjoy the scenery along the way. Ideally would love to be able to rent in Saigon and drop off the car in Hanoi and fly back to Saigon to catch the plane back home. Aside from driving inside Saigon (as I know traffic looks a little hectic) is driving a car around Vietnam recommended, safe, convenient, practical?\n    submitted by    /u/PudgyNugget  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was during a time when I was nervous about returning to Vietnam and meeting my relatives that I have not met a long time ago. So after visiting Vietnam and meeting my family and talking them (in English), I kind of have some newfound respect on Vietnamese language. Despite currently having little economical, political, and entertainment advantage compared to languages like Mandarin, French, Japanese, etc. I somehow wanted to take the commitment to learn Vietnamese. Despite these disadvantages, I wanted to learn Vietnamese because so that I can just have a nice chat with the locals and my relatives. It just as simple as that. So yeah.

This will be my mom’s first time in 20 years and then me and my gf’s first time. \n My gf is white and my family is viet so my parents have some interesting things to say about vietnam and i couldnt tell if they were being genuine or trying to scare us.\n Im mostly worried about cash. How much cash (american USD and vietnamese VND) should we keep on us? My mom kept saying crisp 100 dollar bills but wtf? Also she said to keep money in your passports to get through airport security quick?\n Also, how likely are we to get scammed? My mom believes locals are mean and will try to scam you and rob you.

I stayed with her in her apartment for five days and she basically treated me like I was her boyfriend. She spent a lot of time with me, showed me around, gave me her motorcycle and instructions to explore while she had to do some work. She took me out, cooked for me and even did my laundry. We slept together. And we got to talk and get to know each other a little bit.\n I've never experienced anything like it. She is a very attractive, smart young woman. \n After leaving and coming back to Saigon I felt I wanted to spend more time with her before going back to Europe in a couple of weeks, so I told her that I'd like to see her again. She said I was invited again and that I can stay until I need to go back to Europe (two weeks). I slept on it and decided that I actually want to spend some more time in the city before going back and that spending that much time with her might be too much for me. We then spoke on the phone and I told her that I'd like to come again for 5 days and she got upset and offended that I didn't want to spend all of my time with her and told me it's better we don't see each other then.\n And that was it. I actually wanted to spend more time with her and see where things could possibly go, but it would have been very difficult because she lives and works in a more rural area. I'm not sure what her intentions were exactly, but I appreciated the experience.\n    submitted by    /u/usdavor  \n [link]   [comments]",

In retrospect, it was a significant mistake—one we wouldn't typically make. Perhaps we had grown too complacent due to consistently positive experiences over the last few years, ignoring several red flags that should have set off alarm bells.\n The cab was an unremarkable SUV with a small blue sign and a very modest blue logo on the side, not Vinasun …",

We were planning on starting our Vietnam portion of the trip around the 8th-10th of February, entering from Cambodia into HCMC. We’ve recently been informed that Tet celebrations are during this period. I am personally blaming the fact that we have done the least amount of research on Vietnam as it is the last destination of our trip as to why this was new information to us.\n We have since done a bit of research and have seen conflicting opinions on how much will actually be open/ what we will be able to do in HCMC during this period and was wondering if anyone here would be able to enlighten us. While we think the idea of getting to see the celebrations would be a really cool opportunity, we also don’t want to be stuck in our hostel for days and struggling to find food to eat etc. If this was the case we may extend our Cambodia section of the trip and travel to HCMC at a later date. \n Thanks very much\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Daikon3049  \n [link]   [comments]",

I still see a lot of them in Hanoi's bus stops\n I think it would be much easier for them to connect to customers in need of their service. There's no need to call and asking people walking by if they want a taxi or not, and the app would automatically connect the drivers to someone who needs them. There's no need, and you don't have to idle around under the sun's burning heat in hope of being able to \"fish\" someone\n For all the reasons I mentioned, I don't quite comprehense why drivers don't just all stop doing the old-school way and choose the digital road.\n I get it that not everyone can afford a smart phone, but the budget line of samsung for example is 1 mil, and usable enough to run Grab. I also get that most old-school, traditional drivers are older folks, who might not know how to use a smart phone. But it's a thing that can be easily taught and learned, just how to use that one specific app, when to click this and that, not the whole phone system\n I know I might sound dumb and entitled, but I have no bad intentions and really want to know why.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Arugula6148  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I did bring the medication with me into Vietnam, what are the odds of me getting caught, and what would be the potential ramifications? I am just trying to judge the risks, I know I may be sounding a bit too paranoid.\n What would you all recommend?

Researched a bit on Reddit and found I have chemical burns, which the opinion on Reddit seems to range from “contact a lawyer!” to, “use aloe vera and similar products and you’ll be fine in a couple weeks.” I have no idea what I can and can’t do as an American tourist here. \n It felt like my …",

I’m in touch with an agency which told me that my passport is a problem (I have a Pakistani passport) , they recommend that I go there and start working on a tourist visa and do visa runs every 3 months. Which would give the employer the time to see my capabilities and they’ll probably pull some strings to give me a work permit eventually, maybe. \n It sounds risky to me right now but they claim that the teachers don’t have to face any consequences in case something goes wrong. (what my anxiety heard : something CAN go wrong)\n A part of me tells me this is not a good idea, and that if I’m working abroad, everything should be legal so I’m not constantly under stress. Another part of me wants to just go for it? Believe in myself and take the risk. (this part of me doesn’t care that I’m broke rn)\n I’m also wondering if there’s a chance for me to get employed at an agency or something?

They were pointing around and looked to be directing the employees. Both of us immediately noticed and exchanged a look. One of them was particularly intense, staring around the room and generally having a hostile vibe. He was making his sauce and one of the ingredients was empty and he practically screamed that they needed more. My wife said the employees looked scared when they walked in. They also grabbed one of the display bottles of alcohol off the top of the sauce bar and shared it. Neither of us were that concerned because we know messing with random people only brings unnecessary attention, but it was very obvious these dudes felt comfortable doing what they wanted in this restaurant.

Having recently lived in hcmc I've been hearing mixed opinions from a few people including locals and business owners who scouted to market to hire talent in both cities. Some lived in both and said it's the opposite and people in hanoi generally earn about 20% than hcmc. Others say hcmc is the highest in the country. What are your thoughts.

Before meeting up with my group in Hanoi, I decided to treat myself to a full body massage (as it was listed) at my hotel’s upscale spa. The women there were extremely kind and accommodating. I was given throw away undies to put on and a robe. When I laid down, she had me lay on my back with my breasts fully exposed, which was somewhat uncomfortable. She proceeded to massage my bare breasts for quite a while. I kept thinking to myself, “dont be rude this may be their culture, let her move on to another area…” but when she did, she kept revisiting that area.

My partner and I did a deep exploration, and at the end of the trip, we crossed paths with a monk. We greeted him, and he smiled and greeted us back. I was walking behind him and asked if he was heading home for the day. He replied that he was actually about to have dinner, and then, to my surprise, asked if I'd like to join!\n This took me aback. I hadn't heard of anything like this in reviews or posts about the Marble Mountains. He led us to the dining area and asked us to wait. I could see him discussing with the elder head monk and kitchen staff, who seemed hesitant at first. But soon, we were seated with them in the dining hall.\n It was surreal. The monks were full of laughter, jokes, and playful teasing throughout the meal. After everyone finished eating, they encouraged us to keep filling our plates, and the kitchen staff even came out to chat and ask us questions. Then, they surprised us again by inviting me back for breakfast the next morning at 9am, promising it's even more fun then – \"almost like a party,\" they said.\n So, I'm wondering if anyone else has ever had such an unexpected encounter? Or did I just experience something truly unique, a memory I'll forever cherish as a stroke of luck?\n    submitted by    /u/mybfisabear  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Does this sound familiar? Yes of course there are extremely nice people in Vietnam, but I believe every country has people who are nice. This could be controversial, but the reason why some foreigners say that is because they are white (or black even), so they get the preferential treatment. Cos they look different. By speaking a little Vietnamese, the Vietnamese people are super impressed and treat you even better. Vietnamese people are a curious bunch and they haven't gotten much opportunity to interact with a white/black person.\n Can I say the same for how Vietnamese treat each other? How about foreigners who are from SEA and look exactly like a Vietnamese? I fall into the second category, and typically Vietnamese only treat me a LITTLE better after they realise I'm a foreigner (vì nói chuyện hơi lơ lớ). I run a small food business and I see ALL kinds of people. Conversely, if I were white, I'd imagine it to be a whole lot different.\n So yes, Vietnamese people can be friendly (just as any other country) but it really seem like an overstatement to say that they are some of the friendliest people in the world.\n Edit: Just wanna re-emphasize that I am in no means trying to say Vietnamese people are not friendly or ill-mannered or whatsoever. Every country has both nice and nasty people. I'm just saying Westerners getting preferential treatment shouldn't be mistaken that Vietnamese ppl are the friendliest people in the world.

One day suddenly he's got a 'great job offer' from someone, but he says he just can't tell any details, except that somehow we know:\n  \nHe says his job is just to repeatedly click things; the more clicks the better pay\n He says he 'will get paid' ~3K USD per month, not sure if he's lying or if it'll ever be paid. AFAIK he got paid a little, but three months in, he's still asking parents for borrowing money.\n He must live in where he works, in Hanoi. He can meet parents occasionally. So at least he's not (yet) sold to Cambodia...\n He must work at night\n Once a 'stupid colleague' revealed their IP address or something; entire 'company' must shut down operation and move physically, worrying police will finding out.\n Five people work there\n  \nNot sure if he's a criminal or a victim, or both. He's idealistic and naive--he tried trading cryptos with worst timing possible, lost parents' money; tried making a gaming Youtube channel for profit but got only 100 views, gave up in two weeks. Wants 'modernising' parents' mom-and-pop shop before he can help with family business.\n Parents thinks he's in an actual 'employee' of some criminal activities... I think he'll eventually be sold to Cambodia.\n What can this possibly be?\n    submitted by    /u/daddymartini  \n [link]   [comments]",

There were times I was thrilled to be here. \n But since the Covid period there has been a gradual decline in my view of living here. \n Part of it I think personal - me needing pasteurs new. Part of it I think is environment - my surroundings. \n The volume levels, trash, air and water pollution, huge overdevelopment and bewildering approach to governance has me unhappy. \n I think knowing I can never be a citizen, I can never buy property, and things like have police doing random passport checks at my house now at 2am has something to do with it to. As much as i've loved the country, it doesn't love me back or accept me and it never will. \n Curious to see if I am an outlier in feeling this way, or if anyone else has similar feelings. If so, i'm interested in seeing if this is just a phase and will pass, or whether I am in a downward spiral towards inevitable departure. \n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/HomoSapien908070  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I explained the dimensions of my dog’s carrier the employee told me it was too big. Truthfully, my dog’s carrier is hardly bigger than my dog itself as it is. So any smaller is hard to fathom.\n She told me the required measurements. I have looked online like crazy. I’ve seen small kennels and even extra small kennels. I have not seen any kennel available for purchase that is under the maximum allowed measurements (30cm X 35cm X 20cm).\n It has to be a solid constructed kennel which makes it more difficult and narrows it down even more. The carrying case I flew with is a fabric based one so I couldn’t use a same style for this airplane apparently.\n Does anyone have an idea where I could find such a kennel?

          "description": "Hello everyone! I’m from the UK and I arrived in Da Nang last night and I’m staying for a month in an apartment. Today I tried to go stock up on things like toilet paper, bin bags and some kitchen essentials. I tried two different shops which were described as ‘supermarkets’ on Google maps and I couldn’t find these, even when I asked the employee (using Google translate). Are there specific shops for these things? I also try to track my macros and this is difficult to do when eating out / ordering in so I want to cook some of my meals at home, i haven’t yet found a shop where I can buy chicken, veg and stuff like that. What’s my best bet? Is it markets? If so, can anyone suggest a good one? For reference I’m staying at the edge of the My An area. \n Another thing, I would like to hire a moped to get around the city, can anyone recommend a good hire place for this? I have an international driving licence but not for motorbikes so I need something with a smaller engine, is this available here? Alternatively, how likely am I to get stopped by police when driving around? I’d like to drive myself to hoi an but I don’t want to risk a fine if I get a bigger bike without having a licence for it. I would also like to do the hai van pass but I don’t know if that would be possible on a 50cc as I’ve heard it’s hilly. If you have any other suggestions or tips for me that would be much appreciated! Thanks everyone!\n    submitted by    /u/karolina154  \n [link]   [comments]",

He thought it wasn't a problem but when I went to work his mum told him that it wasn't my home and that I wasn't his \"partner\" so I shouldn't be staying there for so long.\n I then messaged her to apologise the next day and she told me that in Vietnamese culture an unmarried girl cannot stay at her bfs house for too long and it's fine if it's a couple of days or a weekend.\n My boyfriend also stays at mine for over 6 days sometimes and my parents are fine with it, but I think it's a difference in culture.

The start day is early August. \n I've lived abroad before (China) but have been back in the US for 4.5 years and am currently living/working in Denver. \n I was interested in hearing about life in Hanoi from those who currently live there. \n Some top of the mind questions/concerns are: \n How is the pollution? Would you consider the city clean? Is there a large expat community? Is it close-knit? Is it easy to form friend groups? Are there things to do other than go out to eat/drink? What is the fitness scene like? Is there a road biking scene? Is it easy to get out of the city on the weekend for some nature/beach time?\n Any other tips/advice is greatly appreciated.

When we first saw each other - we couldn’t stop staring. It felt like my body was immediately set on fire when we made eye contact. I went to the restaurant every single day, at least twice a day. We never had a real conversation but we were always looking at each other. \n When he was taking someone else’s order - he couldn’t stop staring at me - his dad had to tell him to “stop staring at that girl & focus on taking the order”. He’d play songs that I suggested & we’d dance together - all while maintaining eye contact and smiling ear to ear at each other. \n I was absolutely dying to get his socials & stay in contact but I couldn’t muster up the courage to just ask & when I finally did - he wasn’t there. \n On my last day - I stayed at the restaurant from breakfast till closing time. He gave me my favourite orders & drinks for free because I told him I’d be leaving that night. \n Now that I’m back home - I have this huge empty feeling of loss - deep inside my stomach. Thinking of him makes my chest hurt & feel heavy. I can’t stop myself from crying when I think about his face smiling at me. \n In those few weeks of endless tension, smiles & eye contact - I had never felt happier. He makes me feel alive just by looking into my eyes. He makes me feel absolutely blissfuly happy in a way that I’ve never felt before & I’ve never even properly spoken to him. \n I am desperately planning to go back to Phu Quoc later this year because I feel physically sick at the thought of never seeing him again. \n Idk what it is - if it’s just me romanticising just a simple vacation crush & being delusional or if there is something actually there. \n I feel so empty without him & it’s so silly of me because I don’t even know his name. \n What’s going on? What do I do.. I desperately need advice/another perspective on this.\n    submitted by    /u/psychiatristno828  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I ordered a Yamaha keyboard before Christmas. It turned out that it did not have MIDI port, so I packed it and sent it back.\n Today (2 weeks later) I got a message saying the package was damaged.\n Here is the photo they sent:\n https://preview.redd.it/r8k1ihypgxac1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=b028b8e050c37a030b675390b258c605a8845d58\n This is obviously untrue because the package was fine when I sent it to them. It means it was probably damaged during transportation or even damaged by these \"quality checkers\" themselves.\n The keyboard itself is obviously fine, as well as have all the accessories inside the box:\n https://preview.redd.it/yfb64hvvgxac1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=65b1b48fed7bbb2e1ef38ce852b84c4f88fc101b\n I don't know what to do at this point. The app says that they will send it back to me with some paper to sign. I don't want to sign anything because this is just ridiculous.\n Is \"damaged package\" a real legal reason to reject return? This is not the case in my home country, don't know about Vietnam though. But hey, they could have damaged the package themselves. What should I do at this point?\n P. S., they have my return photo which I took right before sending it back\n ​\n the package is obviously undamaged\n    submitted by    /u/2102just  \n [link]   [comments]",

This morning there was music being broadcast over a loudspeaker, quite pop, animated music for 30 mins. What was this for? The primary school opposite was full of motorbikes and people coming in constantly. A few kids but mostly adults alone.\n Just nosey really! Wondered if anyone knew the reason for the early wake up this morning!\n Edit - Sorry if I offended anyone, I wasn't asking why people are noisy I was just curious! I did try googling but found no information so thought I'd ask on here if this was a common thing.

The thing is i got this one 🇻🇳 which is the national flag. Is that okay? I am actually south vietnamese but i thought the south flag was outdated since vietnam is no longer seperated. Also, my parents think it might be offensive because its a communist flag but they are unsure as well.\n So basically, is the vietnam flag 🇻🇳 okay to hang if im south vietnamese?

But they mostly keep its high price, they dont fluctuate either up or down.\n Sice its almost a month before the flight, as many know, this is a period when the prices start moving and when you can usually pick a good deal.\n I would like to ask knowleable people about in this, do you think is possible that the price is high yet just because of the expectation and it can still drop down, or there more likely there is a really high demand even the 4th day after Tet (as far as I read, most of the people travel before not after Tet)?\n Do I risk that the fare will be completely sold out if I wait longer?\n I would like to hear from the people who have know how this works, please don't post your advices based only on your feelings if you are not experienced in searching cheap fares.\n ​\n EDIT: also I am wondering, about something. Do you think that if I make the reservation to the point I am selecting the seats, this is a real view of how fully is being the flight booked or not? Free seats means not sold yet or they can be sold to 3rd agencies (KAYAK, KIWI...) but yet not sold to the end party...

We arrived on time and received a ticket from the ship personnel which stated 290K VNĐ each. \n The boat was large and comfortable. We excitedly disembarked at the first stop at a large cave. There were maybe 1,000 people walking through the cave which meant walking up steps was 1 or 2 steps at a time. At points where pictures could be taken, there were no less than 50 large boats present in the shot. \n The other two stops to kayak and hike were very short and had boats and tourists everywhere. The smell of exhaust from the boats was bad. \n After disembarking after the day was complete, we thought the tour company made a mistake ( even though my wife is Vietnamese and fluent) since the boat ticket said 290K vnđ and we already paid 900K VNĐ. \n As we left the docks, the tour company contacts us again to pay the second 900K vnđ. When my wife asks about the 290K vnđ tickets, she is told “that does not include your food”. Our food was a mediocre lunch. \n Are we to believe that the boat trip cost 290k vnđ per person and the food cost 610k vnđ per person? Haha. Please. \n My advice is to only book directly with the cruise line. And only do that if you don’t mind paying to be elbow to elbow with tourists\n I will get many downvotes from the tour operators but I bet I get few rebuttals from them\n    submitted by    /u/Rockyt86  \n [link]   [comments]",

But sadly that I'm not a Top tier educated person, so he blamed me alot. He doesn't care about me emotionally, he doesn't care about my interests or hobbies. He only cares about my study. I know Im a big boi with self awareness. But I have no voice to raise in my family, even if I do so, I still get stomped on then get called immature. It's hard for me to connect relationship with him. Do you have any experience similar to mine? How do you cope?\n    submitted by    /u/nchuan123123  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been warned a lot of times about not to carry stuff from strangers/acquaintance/friends/anyone on the airplane, because the stuff may contain harmful drug ingredients. If you get caught in certain countries you may even get death penalty. Some of them go as far as using mind control to make you feel bad if you refuse to do their favor, such as using seniors, disabled people, and orphans as a disguise to ask you to carry stuff on their behalf. In my unpopular opinion, scapegoat seekers (i.e. retards that ask someone to do their dirty jobs while reaping benefits behind the scene) are the WORST HUMANS, COWARDICE ON EARTH, second only to leeches (i.e. people that can read the mood but their skin is so thick that they still cross the line). These kind of “special breeds of people” can be found anywhere in the world, from all backgrounds, ethnic groups, so whoever thinks your background/ethnicity is at play here is FAR WORSE than those aforementioned special breeds.\n    submitted by    /u/jelkyanna  \n [link]   [comments]",

They handed me beer, food, rice wine, etc. We kept drinking for quite some time. There was also a bit of weed which they offered me and that I smoked.\n Eventually we go a bit further away, they said to listen to some music. We arrive at some small shop but there is no music. After that I say I am going home and I don't need help going home, I can walk. One of the guys insists I go with him on the scooter. Despite the language barrier, I understand it as if he will now drive me home, so I go with him. Instead we drive for a bit with me barely getting closer to my home and we get off at the center square of the city. We talk for a bit and I say I am walking home now, they suggest I take one of the nearby taxis. It feels a bit sketchy for me so I do not take a taxi and I tell the guys I will walk home. I start walking and with an uneasy feeling. There are not many people out at this time. I order a Grab and it arrives quite quick, then I eventually get back to my hotel safely.\n I am not sure what to think of this whole meeting. It should also be mentioned that I did not see anyone paying for the bill at the restaurant, and I got the impression that I was sort of expected to pay for it, since at one time the bill was placed in front of me. I never paid though.\n What do you think? Was I at risk of something happening?\n    submitted by    /u/nicotinecravings  \n [link]   [comments]",

She was fighting, kicking and crying. Everyone just looked, it was a crowded street, the taxi drove of. I ran after it after a bit of hesitation, luckily there was oncoming traffic so I was able to catch up to the car. I opened the taxi drivers front door and told him to let the women out. He tried unlocking the door but the man locked the door always from inside and yelled at the driver to drive away. Finally I was able to open the door, the women sadly just ran away, I tried to keep the dude contained by holding the door, but he pushed the door open, punched me and then ran after the women. After I got my footing back I ran after them, but I wasn’t able to locate them by foot. I tried asking expats to follow them on the bike but no one wanted to.. so I sprinted to the police in Thao dien, who also seemed disinterested… I don’t know how to feel.\n    submitted by    /u/Soulfreezer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My dad who is now a viet kieu had brought a house years ago in Vietnam for his father and brother to live in. He had to change the ownership to his father since Vietnam doesn't allow viet kieu to own properties in the country. Unfortunately, a a few years after the dad passed away, the next person to have their name on the property is his brother and the brother promised my dad that he will give the house back to him later on when the time is right even though they didn't sign any contract because my dad naively believed in him. His brother is now dead and the ownership goes to his wife. My dad expected his sister in law to then rightfully transfer the ownership to him or even half of the house because the sister in law did help the family a lot while my dad was overseas, but she retorted back saying that my dad did not care about the family at all and had contributed nothing so he does not deserve any part of the house. We are going to sue her because we have the papers that prove that my dad did contribute a lot to that house and even my late grandpa acknowledged that in one of his old letters to my dad. The house in question is currently for rent as a business. My dad and I found a lawyer through connections and he said to stop my auntie from potentially selling it later, we must first block her from doing that by depositing 20% value of the house to the funds before the court trial since that's how the law works. Is that correct? I'm trying to find a new lawyer cause I don't trust this one and I see him as really incompetent.
