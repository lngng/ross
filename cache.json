          "description": "Hey all,\n I recently came back from a 4 month trip in Vietnam where I cruised along with hotels and airbnbs. Yes it got slightly out of hand and my budget grew.\n I work remotely and I’ve decided to try living in Vietnam longer term. I have a 5 year visa and I need to exit the country every 6 months which is fine because visit family and friends back home. \n  \n I am figuring out the right visa for me… Even though I can stay in the country for 6 months on a tourist visa. But I’m confused? \n  \nI want to rent a high rise serviced apartment with 2 rooms close to the center. Is US$600 per month enough? \n I don’t plan to party and drink (as much as I did last trip) and I’m more focused on really understanding the motherland. I want it to be more meaningful and I create real, lasting friendships. \n So I plan to budget US$500-800 for spending money for everything I need per month.\n I’m extremely interested in investing and entrepreneurship here in Vietnam. So I’d like to start a business here. \n I leave in December again. I’m getting travel insurance etc. visa, passport and everything renewed. \n Any tips are welcome! Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/AustralianWhale  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know, 7 days is nothing in a country such as this.\n I am going to start in Ho Chi Minh, for the first 2 days, then I was thinking of taking an overnight train/bus to start making my way up to Hanoi. \n Other than Ho Chi Minh, I would like to visit Halong Bay, or Ninh Binh, or maybe both. Then I would like to go up to the Mount Fansipan (highest point), then obviously visit Hanoi too.\n Is this doable? Do you guys have any recommendations for me?\n Thank you so much!\n All the best.\n    submitted by    /u/senpai1g  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sometimes people give us money and we do a grocery pickup for the case worker. \n Will you help me create a list of basics that they may want in their kitchen? Keep in mind that the food is limited in Walmart - for example, I can't get rice noodles most of the time, so food that can be substituted is important. They will have nothing in their kitchens and we can't provide everything so knowing what foods are more common/used more is better than having a big variety of things.

          "description": "I see many myths perpetuated both here and in daily life. This happens with all languages (see endless arguments on YouTube about Tamil/Sanskrit/Chinese being 'the oldest language', a nonsensical notion).\n Some typical myths:\n - Vietnamese grammar is 'backwards' compared to English/other language of choice (or just difficult in general)\n - Vietnamese has many words/syllables/etc. with different meanings (making it difficult)\n - The Vietnamese writing system is difficult and 'needs' to be reformed\n Just off the top of my head, I have seen and heard these three very recently. If I sat down and thought/researched I could list many more.\n The problem is that none of these claims mean anything in isolation. Many words with different meanings---compared to what language? Difficult writing system---compared to what other writing systems? And where's the evidence? There is never or very rarely any evidence or standards of comparison given. As a linguist I could go into detail on these issues, but I'd rather see what other people have to say first.\n Now flame me and tell me why I'm wrong.\n    submitted by    /u/legatrixx  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was born in Vietnam but left at a very young age and a dual citizen of both countries. I've made the stupid mistake of applying for an ID which means now that my name is in the system and they've just called me up for a health checkup tomorrow for conscription in 2023 as I'm 23yo and the age of conscription is until you're 27 (as I've recently found out).\n Has anyone been through this before? Is there any way to get out of this since I'm a dual citizen or would I have to leave the country ASAP, I did enter on my Vietnamese Passport. My mum is convinced if they conscript me I'll lose my Australian citizenship.\n I'd really appreciate some advice or if anyone could recommend me a good lawyer in Hanoi regarding this matter, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/DragonXDT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Would love to know what are thoughts from different age groups of Vietnam locals about developing advanced economy, despite all the problems mentioned in different industry articles.\n My core part at work is a radical shift in commerce / production & supply chains with innovating incentives for companies, employees and end customers / consumers that adopts to clean tech driven supply chains; be it food, healthcare, renewables, electronics, FMCG, sales through new B2B, B2C channels, services, EVs etc.\n I personally love the creative designs from Vietnam that uses natural biofibers (bamboo, hyacinth etc.) & overall designs. They are at par with details from Japanese, Chinese, Thailand's creative arts - a mix of tradition, nature & modern.\n I also got surprised by recent developments & announcements by Vingroup EV making in US for US customers. & at the same time, I wonder why MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) of Vietnam are not gearing up faster at global stage. \n For example, I never see them at industrial trade shows of the West (US, EU) or even at the East (digital or physical attendance), even though products are pretty good & innovative. Lets say Amazon SEA summit in Singapore, there are zero Vietnamese companies / MSMEs.\n Few of them are on Alibaba, but finding other MSMEs is hard as Alibaba is not that connected with new development outside of China, and the restrictions etc. makes it more complicated. \n Also, few good points from my research are repeated in this article: on Vietnam + ASEAN region since most of our suppliers at work are looking at ASEAN countries for shifting their production from China.\n https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/Vietnam-s-battle-to-climb-the-global-value-chain\n    submitted by    /u/starlord_west  \n [link]   [comments]",

I searched Tet in the sub history and did not see many things regarding the questions I have.\n Firstly, my girlfriend and I are interested in traveling to Vietnam during Tet as it seems like a joyous way to celebrate the new year. Here in the US there are group activities such as bars to go to and fire work shows. We looked at cities and dates, and have thought about spending the month of January from beginning to end in Hoi An.\n I understand we may be behaving as ignorant Americans, thinking that everything will be open or that there will be mass celebrations. But we really just want to experience the culture. Is it possible -post Covid- to do this somewhere in Vietnam? Neither of us wish to be disrespectful to your country. We are realistic travelers, we know to go with the flow and are ok with buying food to make our own meals. We do NOT expect to be catered to or waited on. We want to enjoy your beautiful culture.\n Is Hoi An truly a good city for this type of thing, or should we go to Ho Chi Minh city?\n If it is possible to join a city in celebration of Tet, how should we go about this while being respectful?\n Thank you for taking the time to read this, I wish you the best.\n ​\n EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. I see I did misunderstand the nature of Tet. It seems it would be better for my girlfriend and I to visit during a different time year. I appreciate you all. We will look for somewhere else to visit.\n    submitted by    /u/That_one_Gguy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not to mention he has body odor, bad feet and smelly shoes which is quite annoying to me. He disrespected me in our first dating.

I'm planning to visit the country south to north (mostly focusing on the north) , and I'd like to stay in Vietnam for 25 days (I'll dedicate either 4-5 days to Cambodia, just checking out to the capital and Angkor Wat). Is that enough or too much time? My main interest are nature, and history. I don't really care about hitting the beach, and partying is okay but not like a must. My itinerary is Ho chi Minh - flight to Hoi an - Hue - Phong Nha - Tom Coc (ninh binh) - Hanoi - cruise to Ha long Bay - Ha Giang Loop . Is there anything that i'm missing?\n I'm planning to be there at the end of February, March (i'll definitely be in the north during march). Is that a good time to visit? Can I book everything once I'm already there such as accommodation/flights to have some extra flexibility, or is it high season and I'd probably book everything ahead to avoid shitty hostels and expensive flights?\n Should I bother going to Sapa or is it too cold/foggy in March, and not worth it?\n How is it safety wise? Are night buses safe, do they drop you in the middle of nowhere or you can ask them to drop you close to your accommodation? I'm not thrilled about potentially walking alone at night with a huge backpack. Can you as tourist (i'm a skinny white girl there is no way I'll pass for a Vietnamese) walk safely at night alone ? Is taking taxis/tuk tuk alone at night safe (i've lived in south america, heard way too many horror stories)?\n Thanks for all the help :)\n    submitted by    /u/bi_shyreadytocry  \n [link]   [comments]",

I came across the Chut ethnic group located in eastern Laos and in Quang Binh province and I’ve have been trying to find information on their religious beliefs and specific cultural idiosyncrasies that separate them from or align them with other ethnic practices in Vietnam. I suppose I am more trying to find out more about their “religious” practices, primarily relating to death and funeral processions. I can’t find anything. \n Do they practice a generally “animist” belief system pertaining to the afterlife, spirits, etc? I know commonly in animist belief structure, there is this idea of the wandering soul, in that unnatural or untimely or violent death can result in malevolent spirits that cause turmoil for those around. Is this pertinent among any of the 5 subgroups (ruc, May, etc) under the Chut umbrella? \n Thanks for any input\n    submitted by    /u/michizzard  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are left to rot as eyesores all over the country. Unfinished construction sides and rubbish everywhere. You can see this in Saigon, Hoi An, Dong Nai, Mui Ne, many places. And its too late to reverse it, the environment is already destroyed. They stay there to rot for a decade or more sometimes.\n Illegal developments, most likely with crooked local govt involvement. Example: https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/phu-quoc-to-raze-79-illegal-villas-4518959.html . And once again, the environment is totally destroyed already, cant get it back.\n Developments run by competent organisations, but way too much public land is granted to them. One example - Novaworld Phan Thiet was granted almost an entire 1km of public beach front land just for them. Likewise, big sections of Phu Quoc, Nha Trang, Quy Nhon and others have had the environment totally wiped out for all manner of empty resorts. Is this not outrageous?\n  \nI am interested to hear from Vietnamese especially. Are people upset and angry about stuff like this? Or do people not particularly care? Or do many people actually 'like' it or prefer it?\n    submitted by    /u/HomoSapien908070  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nhưng từ khi bên này chạy chương trình khuyến mãi thì xảy ra rất nhiều chuyện như: giày giặt cả tháng cũng chưa có, không hề gọi điện thoại báo, để khách đi đi lại lại nhiều lần, đôi khi nổi điên thì mới sắp xếp trả giày. Mà trả giày còn ẩm ướt mới tức.\n Một lần giặt đôi thể thao trắng (mới mang được 1 lần), giày giặt hơn cả tháng mới có, xong 2 ngày sau lấy ra thì giày mốc đen toàn bộ đôi giày. Mình mang lại thì nói xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại, hẹn mình 2 tuần sau quay lại trả giày. Khi nhận lại gì một số vết ố mốc đen giặt không ra, mình có hỏi thì nhận được câu trả lời “xin lỗi” là xong. Tức cầm giày về thế là bỏ luôn đôi giày.\n Hôm nay bị một cú quá đau, cách đây hơn 1 tháng mình có gửi giặt 3 đôi giày. Mình nhờ em mình ghé lấy giày dùm, em mình chỉ kiểm tra 1 đôi thì thấy đôi trắng bị mốc đen, cũng bài cũ xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại. Em mình cầm 2 đôi còn lại về mà ko kiểm. Tối mình đi làm về mở ra xem thì muốn chết đứng luôn ạ, toàn bộ da bị co cứng, teo lại và bị chết, đế lót cong veo,...mang ko còn vừa. Mình nhắn facebook không phản hồi. Là đôi mình rất thích kiếm mãi mới có, nên giữ rất cẩn thận, mỗi lần mang ai cũng khen đẹp. Lúc mang đến thì còn đẹp, nhận lại thì eo ôi không còn nhận ra hình hài của em nó...\n Thực sự quá tệ từ dịch vụ cho đến chất lượng :((\n    submitted by    /u/nguyenminhthu123  \n [link]   [comments]",

We really liked the Old Quarter, the area around Hoan Kiem lake and the busy streets with the narrow houses.\n I was thinking about going to HCMC this time again and would like to know if there is a district or area where you can get this \"Hanoi feeling\".\n Any help is highly appreciated.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Sufficient-Payment16  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've considered going to Vietnam for 1mon to do so, but I'm not sure if it's a good fit culturally and logistically. Please share any experiences or insights.\n My main concerns are:\n  \nworking time from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. - should I look for co-working spaces etc. or is it generally realistic to use the hotel WiFi? I don't need a lot of bandwidth, but it should be stable.\n \nI'm autistic and while sensory-wise bustling cities and dense traffic are totally fine, I struggle with judgemental/high conformity culture, expectations of haggling and worst, being viewed as a \"target\". I have lived in China and Japan, which was okay since speaking the language mitigated most of the issues. Unfortunately, the reports about Vietnam I have read point towards exactly my issues being...well, an issue.

          "description": "I got married to a Viet girl recently and we argue about money a lot. I was born in Canada so my idea was that we would contribute equal percentage from our income for our shared expenses, and we handle the rest ourselves (to each their own money) - however she's not happy with it. She thinks that since I make more, I should contribute more than her since I will have a lot more money left. Is this the norm for a Viet girl? House chores we share 50/50 (I'd often do more because I want to) and everything else is equal but she won't budge about this part.\n Everyone is completely misunderstanding my point. We aren't doing the 50/50 split. I pay over 70% of everything. What I suggested was we both put half of our income into a shared account from which we would pay for our expenses. The idea of each of us having separate money to handle for ourselves was from her. The point here is that she thinks I should put more than half my money and she less so, so that what's left to each of us is more or less equal. She also wants to keep her job and not have children for at least another 7-8 years.\n    submitted by    /u/ZenDaFout  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm tired of working in the office with dramas and I'd like to be flexible so Freelance is my top choice. I've worked as an English teacher and content creator before. I am trying my best to learn more about digital marketing and photoshop for my future. \n I created my Upwork account and tried my best to apply and get proposals but there was no result. I was upset a little bit. my parents are older and they often get sick so I'd like to push myself in working freelance. Should I still look for a job patiently or get some free work and then get a rate? \n I can write English articles, create content on social media and get a good boost. Would you like to recommend me anything? I'm pleased to listen from you guys! Thanks in advance!\n Bonus: my house is noisy so I can't teach English at home or work as n English tutor. And I'd like to manage social media than teaching kids.\n    submitted by    /u/MariaKnight123  \n [link]   [comments]",
