          "description": "In recent years, Vietnam has been making strides in the world of technology and innovation. With the rise of start-ups and the increasing number of high-tech companies moving their branch offices to Vietnam, is there a possibility that Vietnam, this Southeast Asian nation, could become the next start-up nation in Asia?\n The shift from China to Vietnam has been noticeable, with companies such as Samsung, LG, and Intel all establishing a strong presence in Vietnam. This trend is not limited to just large corporations, as start-ups are also finding success in Vietnam's growing tech scene.\n One reason for Vietnam's appeal is its young and highly educated population. According to the World Bank, nearly 60% of Vietnam's population is under the age of 35, and the country boasts a literacy rate of over 95%. This has created a strong talent pool for tech companies to draw from.\n Another factor contributing to Vietnam's potential as a start-up nation is its favorable business environment. The Vietnamese government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurship. The country has also made significant improvements in infrastructure, including expanding its internet connectivity and investing in new technology parks.\n However, there are still challenges that Vietnam must overcome in order to fully realize its potential as a start-up nation. One major hurdle is the lack of venture capital funding available for start-ups. While the government has taken steps to address this issue, more needs to be done in order to attract investment and support the growth of new businesses.\n Source & full text from https://www.micronews.site/2023/05/will-vietnam-become-next-start-up.html\n    submitted by    /u/very-creative  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do tourists usually visit there in summer? Do public buildings, restaurants and trains have AC? Do locals spend time outside during the day or do they usually try to stay inside?\n Pretty much what I wanna know is if I'll be able to have a good time despite the warm weather and rain.

He threw the hat in front of the meter and I could still see the fare in the reflection of the windshield. It started off at 10k and rose very slowly.

We've been married for 6.5 years together for 10. \n I've been to Vietnam many times and I love it, when we touch down in Saigon I start getting an almost 'coming home' vibe. My Viet language skills are actually not too bad, so I can get around by myself, order my own food, shopping, basic conversation. \n Anyway, my in laws are coming here for a visit, it's winter so doing some of the really great Australian outdoor type activities, so we are gonna take them out for dinners, some shows etc. We have planned for a weekend away in a cottage in the countryside with some of my family. Now my in laws speak next to zero english, and my family speak no Viet. \n I'm just wondering if anyone might have some suggestions for some good activities we could enjoy together without having to rely to heavily on my wife to translate constantly. Like some games or activities or board games etc. We can do while enjoying a couple of beers by the fireplace. Hopefully someone out there has some suggestions, I just want them to feel like they're participating with us rather than just observers.\n Thanks ☺️\n    submitted by    /u/No-Scientist-1416  \n [link]   [comments]",

Wanted to share some things I saw for foreigners in terms of how to get into town with zero stress taking a grab.\n 1) Go through customs, Exit international terminal. Look for the green umbrella tents across the street. 100 yards max. cant miss them. 5-6 large green umbrellas. I dont ever remember seeing these before. \n 2) open grab and use the green umbrella area as your pick up spot.\n it should cost you 125k dong to get into D1. Grab will add 15k for the airport toll. Total bill should be about 140k + any surge. The driver pays the toll.\n Waiting for grab at 6am = 10 mins\n ride to D1 took 15-20 mins.\n Cost was 140k dong which is like 7 bux. and best was ZERO stress of being ripped. had 3-4 taxi guys approach and follow me to grab area.\n    submitted by    /u/trojanmana  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Foodie friend asked me to help ask around...\n La Maison 1888 is the French fine dining restaurant of Intercontinental Hotel Da Nang. This hotel is a 30 minute car ride away from the main beach because it is on the far end of the coast, and it does not allow Grab pickups out of the hotel. The restaurant is built into an old villa on a cliff, overlooking the water, and is very beautiful. They emphasize that they have the only 3 Michelin star French chef working there, and claim to be the #1 food destination in Vietnam. (Tasting menu is VND4-5M.)\n The advertising feels scammy because there is no such thing as a Michelin star chef. They claim the chef helped design the menu and he runs a 3 Michelin star restaurant in Paris, which is not the same thing and he is not in the Da Nang restaurant. Vietnam will only get Michelin rated retaurants in 2023, and only in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. There are very few blog reviews about the restaurant, and their TripAdvisor and Google Maps reviews do not imply that this is a legendary must try before you die place.\n Can Vietnam foodies comment?\n Sample blog post: https://secretlifeoffatbacks.com/20...-sun-peninsula-resort-the-ultimate-in-luxury/\n    submitted by    /u/josemartinlopez  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My Viet boyfriend and I (South Korean girl) have dated for a year. We’re at the same age (2000 kids). We studied abroad at the same uni in Canada. Last year, my parents came to Canada to attend my convocation. I introduced him to my parents, and they're really impressed with him bc of his family background, handsome face, height, education and graduation job (these things are very important in Korean culture), \n Next month, he and I will travel to Vietnam for summer vacation and visit his parents in Hanoi. I wanna make them impressed just like he did on my mom and dad. \n What can I do to impress his parents?Especially when I come to his family house, and we do not speak the same language. \n Do old Viet people judge girls by their look, family background like Korean do? I’m quite confident but I don’t look like Viet girls.\n My Viet female friend say Hanoi parents are extremely conservative. Is that true?\n What gifts should I give to them? I have some high-end korean skincare products for his mom, but have no idea for his dad.\n Update: thank you guys for great suggestions. As I know from my Viet female friend, his parents are well off and live in a big mansion in Hanoi. That could mean they’re open minded like you guys commented. I’m confident in answering all questions regarding family background, I know rich Asian people care about these things. My dad also asked him about his dad’s job when we had dinner in Toronto. My boy has a brother who has a wife working as IELTS teacher. Both of them can speak English, so luckily I have more people to talk without translation and support me.

I actually think cows and pigs are just as smart and loving, if not more, than dogs, so I realized that I don't really have an issue eating dogs due to abuse because cows/pigs in the US are brutalized far more than dogs in vietnam (look up factory farming practices in the US if you don't believe me, it is truly an abomination).\n However, I'd like to \"kill two birds with one stone\", if you will.

Perfect for getting in and out of my small street and driveway. \n The VinFast Fadil, after some initial research, seems like a solid option. It's both cheaper in VN and seemingly has more features than the competitors like the Toyota Wigo, Honda Brio, or Chevrolet Spark...\n However, I haven't been able to find any decent English reviews of the car online. Can anyone who has owned one share their experiences? Are they a reliable car? Worth the 380 million or so to purchase one?\n    submitted by    /u/TimidEngineer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm debating on whether or not I should try it. Is it safe to eat? Like are these dogs bred to be eaten or are they diseased street animals that are caught and cooked?\n By the way, while I love dogs, I find it somewhat hypocritical that people will turn a blind eye to the atrocious factory farming practices deployed on cows and pigs, while judging the shit out of people who eat dog. As someone who grew up on a farm, I can tell you that both cows and pigs are just as intelligent, if not more, than most dogs.

However that leaves a notice on the paper that states “not valid for use abroad” or something along these terms. However the hagwons seem to accept it anyway, and I’m not sure if that’s the same as Vietnam. \n Has anyone here used Accurate Biometrics before, and which option did you select before submitting your request? \n In the second to last drop down box on the demographics page, did you select for personal review, or the “visa requirement/living abroad” option?

          "description": "So yesterday i met a couple of guys from my country and we drank beer and had a good time on the party street. Next thing i know is that im sitting on a random guys scooter on the way to his apartment, i dont remember his face, i dont remember him taking my phone at all. What i remember is just being very upset about losing my phone but still remained relatively calm. In a proper manner, i asked a guy in a green uniform who was nearby when it happend (i think) and it just felt like he was part of it all. \n The guy has withdrawn more than $600 (the card was in the phonecase\", do you think its possible to get this back because i am already on a tight budget... Maybe need to make police report for that and im probably leaving tomorrow. Whats even more scary is how he knew my pin-code. Something that sucks too is that all my pictures are gone. This was a big shit storm and it has completely ruined my mood and now i probably cant continue traveling as long as I planed.\n Has anyone been in this situation before? I would gladly take all tips from you guys.\n    submitted by    /u/Elegant_Meaning_200  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are many different kind of banana plants and I especially like the one being grown here in Vietnam so I'd really like to take one home. I can't get one like this in my home country so this is the only way. From what I know I have to carry a phytosanitary certificate for this. Now, I have a couple of questions:\n 1.) what exactly is a banana plant called in vietnamese and in what kind of shop can I buy one? Most garden shops don't sell those. They grow everywhere but I can't just steal one, right?\n 2.) for phytosanitary certificate I found this site. I'm at a hotel in Hanoi so I could just drive there. My main concerns are: Are 7 days enough time? Do I need a real adress in Vietnam? What would it cost?\n Thank you in advance <3\n    submitted by    /u/Embarrassed_Leg_4532  \n [link]   [comments]",

Strangely enough, a couple of them, I think those were gold & diamond stores, did not allow us to enter and were very rude. In one such outlet (picture attached), the guard blocked our way, and just kept saying \"No\". Not sure if they were just prejudiced against us (Indians) or was it something else. Racism is something I have never observed in oriental countries.\n    submitted by    /u/pugmarx_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have this annoying pet peeve when it comes to parking my motorbike, whether it is in front of a restaurant or in some motorbike parking that when I come back I always find my bike: 1) moved somewhere else and mashed between other motorbikes, 2) the dude is sitting on my motorbike and smoking a cigarette, 3) both 1 and 2. I’ve been living here for about 5 years now and it still bothers me til this day. If I frequent a place then I usually build a relationship with the guy and give him a little extra coffee money to leave my bike where it is and to not do the things I stated above so it works out. But, when it’s a new place that I barely go to I usually don’t have that luxury and I become quite annoyed by this experience every time. I have a little bit of OCD and care about the condition of my motorbike and would like to keep it in nice condition. It really bothers me that I spend a lot of time and money to keep it nice just for some guy who doesn’t give a fuck to erase all those efforts in a matter of 10 minutes and scratch it all up. I understand that I don’t deserve special treatment when there are other people besides me, but this standard of service shouldn’t be ok especially when it’s my personal property and I am parking to be a customer at the place. \n If this sort of thing also bothers you, how do you deal with it? I find that most locals with old and beaten bikes do not care. But what if you have a nice modded bike or even a big bike that costs 150mil + vnd?

I’ve booked two weeks in Ho Chi Minh City (located I. District 1) and will be hiring a motorbike to get around (not opposed to getting on a domestic flight though).\n I spent 1 month travelling around Vietnam last year and had an amazing time, I’ve always been curious around this country and the people and I was not disappointed! \n I am a contemporary artist and work for a University of Fine Arts in Australia so I am really looking for creative things to partake in. There must be a network of musicians and artists in this wonderful city of millions!? When researching online for things to check out it seems like only the really obvious stuff comes up (I can’t help but wonder if it’s because I’m searching from within Australia). I want to see exhibitions by local, innovative artists, maybe undertake some workshops in craft traditions and music gigs by exciting Vietnamese bands! Where can I go or what venues offer this? (not interested in night clubs haha). Thanks for any suggestions ✌️🙏👍\n    submitted by    /u/ultmag  \n [link]   [comments]",

After that, I got interested in vietnamese culture, the food, the language, the music. I listened to popular vietnamese songs on Youtube. Not the oldschool, historically famous ones. More like the hits of the last few years.\n ​\n I remember listening to one song in particular and I just can't find it anymore. It wasnt the best song or anything, but it bugs me because I can see the video clip in my head and it's frustrating. Here is what I know about it : \n  \nThe main singer was a man \n It was released before the end of 2019\n The clip is at night, in a big city. A man and a woman are having fun, getting drunk, playing pool. And there's an underlying love story\n I think he's hoping something happens betweem them \n I think it was rap. But maybe not 100% rap ? \n  \nI know it's not much... But if it rings a bell to anyone, it would make my day and remind me great memories !

I had to ask for a sim removal tool (usually it comes with the new sim pack) and the lady dug up a paper clip (This was my first clue something was wrong) and taped that to the card as well.

They basically took of our shoes from our feet - pretended to wash them with their super duper chemicals and glued an extra heel on my bf’s Birkenstock sandals (which of course came off after a few days and looks hilarious). After finishing their grand hard work of one minute they asked us 500.000 dongs from each of us (~40 euros in total). It’s not that I didn’t expect for them to ask money, I understood it from the very beginning but they were really good and quick in undressing us.. I gave them 500.000 (shouldn’t have) and they asked for another half. I literally showed them my wallet - I didn’t have that much. It is funny that they didn’t agree to take less than 500.000 - they were insisting on their price and I started finally showing my attitude, saying that we didn’t want their “service” in the first place and that we don’t have more money. So I told them let’s call the police. They didn’t like the idea and their hooligan leader took my bf’s shoe and threw it in the trash bin direction. We quickly vanished afterwards. So, our stupidity is not under a question mark - it was our first day in Vietnam, we were probably jetlagged and awed, and just fools. However, we indeed said “no” many many times and actually the next level would’ve been shouting, which we didn’t even consider and our politeness costed us 500000 dongs. My question is about the police - which side would’ve they taken? I assume this shoe business is illegal and we would’ve been right? But I saw so many people in forms in the city (I assume - policemen) - how come is their business still running?\n    submitted by    /u/JustabitLii  \n [link]   [comments]",

My partner has lived here since birth and his parents came here i think shortly after the war. They are both from northern Vietnam. I have only lived here for 4 years. I refer to them as bố and mẹ since I'm learning Vietnamese, and bố told me that since my partner and I are living together, it is the same as being married in Vietnam, and that it's fine for me to call them bố and mẹ since its normal to call your in-laws mom and dad, and this is also common in the culture that I grew up in. The issue/thing that is confusing me is that while neither have an issue with me calling them that, bố always responds for himself as bố , while mẹ switches between mẹ and cô. I only use simple vietnamese at the moment, but an example would be:I: khi nào bố sẽ đi làm ? B: bố đi làm lúc (time)\n Mẹ would use the same or respond with cô. Is this a regional or cultural thing, or is this because there is no blood relation? I don't think I have heard her use it with my partner or her daughter, but it oculd be that I missed it because I'm still learning the language. I also thought that it might be similar to how bạn, tôi is used as another exception pronoun.

I visited my wife’s family in HCMC and now I have dreams of coming to live there too. I, of course, would try to find our own place to live as I would never want to burden my wife’s family.\n However, when telling my wife’s family that I want to move there they continuously tell us never to move there. When asked if they would ever move to the USA they always say no because it is boring, dangerous, and they love the life they have in Vietnam. I don’t understand why someone would tell me not to live somewhere if they would not leave that place at the first opportunity. They live a great life in Vietnam and my wife’s brother is always taking trips to other nearby countries and buying expensive things as a flight attendant. \n I make a lot more money here in the USA, but with the rising cost of living and potential economic recession, I wish for a life that is much simpler. Am I wrong for wanting that? Am I wrong for thinking they might be hypocrites? Am I wrong for thinking I could have a much more comfortable life there? Please let me know.\n    submitted by    /u/KodyUnder  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m getting a motorbike so these places that are for 1 day are just stop overs with maybe ¾ of the day for exploring, hence the odd day calculations…just want to be realistic.\n In total the trip is 29 days long but ultimately wondering what people’s opinions are at the times in these locations? Am I spending too much/too little time in places or prioritizing the wrong places? The only thing set in stone is Ha Long Bay, I’ll need to be there by the 26th day. My hostel in HCMC is also booked but was $12/night so is a wash if things change.\n The trip is pretty linear so things to an extent can be cut and put other places. Would love folks opinions cause most things I read say everywhere is amazing and I don’t have all the time haha!\n (3.75 days) Days 1 to 5 Ho Chi Minh City\n *I originally had 3 days is this too much time at 4 days? Worried Jet lag will put me out of commission for the day, but I arrive around noon my first day\n (1.75 days) Day 5 to 7 Phan Thiet/Mui Ne\n *Should I take a day here and give it to Dalat? Should I skip?\n (.75 days) Day 7 to 8 Dalat\n (1.75 days) Day 8 to 10 Nha Trong\n (.75 days) Days 10 to 11 Quy Nhon\n *Could go straight to Pleiku but have heard good things about Quy Nhon?\n (.75 days) Days 11 to 12 Pleiku\n (2.75 days) Days 12 to 15 Hoi An/Da Nang\n (1.75 days) Days 15 to 17 Hue\n (1.75 days) Days 17 to 19 Phong Nha\n *Wanted to do only 1 day but think if I wanna see the caves will need a whole extra day\n (.75 days) Days 19 to 20 Vinh or Thai Hoa\n *OR I am going to skip and take a bus from Dong Hoi to Ninh Binh saving a day\n (1.75 days) Days 20 to 22 Ninh Binh\n (3.75 days) Days 22 to 26 Hanoi\n (2.75 days) Days 26 to 28 Ha Long Bay *Already booked\n (1 day) Day 28-29 Stay Near Airport in Hanoi and Go Home\n    submitted by    /u/smmossey88  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's both for them just for fun but also in case one of them develops dementia or Alzheimer's disease. If you didn't know, playing music from someone's formative years can help them have clear and lucid moments if they have a cognitive degenerative disease. \n Does anyone have specific artist suggestions and where to find them? I am in the US so I usually use Youtube or Spotify to search for music and I'm not aware of what services in VN would have music from that era. Anyway, when I have searched on google, I see a lot of articles about early rock and roll in Sai Gon. I don't think my parents would have listened to that or gone to any of those clubs since they are from Central and rarely traveled to Sai Gon. \n I believe it would be very meaningful to my parents so thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/ForwardStudy7812  \n [link]   [comments]",

He is now fluent in the spoken and written language (although he’s read a bunch of classic literature so some people tell him he speaks like he’s from the 1920s hahaha). He’s traveled in Vietnam for probably 1.5 years total. \n The other night I was showing him this old book I found about social etiquette in the US in the early 1900s. It had very specific things like “how to write a letter of apology” or “how to help someone out of a carriage.“ As we were reading, he said, “I wish I could find a book like this about the nuances of Vietnamese culture!”\n I’ve looked around the internet, but because I cant speak Vietnamese, most of the books I find are travel books for people that don’t know anything about the country. I’d love suggestions about books written in Vietnamese about the “unspoken“ rules and nuances of Vietnamese culture.\n    submitted by    /u/Elephant_Gun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I will be coming to Vietnam at the end of May. I was planning to do an overnight cruise in Ha Long Bay during my trip, however some of the threads have me a bit concerned. \n A lot of posts in different forums have mentioned about the bay being extremely dirty with floating garbage in most places and smelling of diesel everywhere. Since a lot of these posts are from different years I want to know from someone who has been there recently if that is still the case? If so how badly does it affect the experience? I'm mostly interested in the views and maybe kayaking so please tell according to that. I also read some suggesting to opt for day cruise instead but I have my heart set on spending at least one night under the stars with scenic view on the cruise, are my expectations too much?\n Is it worth spending extra for better quality cruises? I don't plan on splurging what the best 5 star cruises cost, so will probably look for a relatively cheap 5 star or a 4 star cruise. Are they considerably better than the budget/3 star cruises or if I'm not going for the top tier it makes no difference?\n Is Lan Ha Bay a better option? As long as the views are good I won't mind a switch. If the views are not that good but the crowd is considerably less then I will even prefer it. I can compromise on activities a bit as well.\n Please let me know your thoughts.\n    submitted by    /u/lelouch_lamperouge__  \n [link]   [comments]",

He lived in a mainly chinese area of saigon and fled the country with his family after the south lost. The article mentions that “most” of the people who left south vietnam in the 70s were of chinese origin as well. This was surprising to me as i always thought it was mainly people of viet descent and maybe only a few chinese (I only know what i was told since im 2nd gen and was born way after my grandparents left). But do you think this was likely true about boat people being mostly chinese? If so why would mainly chinese people have been the ones to leave vietnam after the end of the war?\n    submitted by    /u/CauliflowerFew1515  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ll be traveling to the office next week - but am concerned about the risks associated with traveling through customs with oxycodone pills… without them I’d be going through intense withdrawals, so I have to either do the trip and bring pills with me, or find an excuse to cancel the trip outright - which would have some pretty damaging outcomes (and could literally reduce my remaining earn-out from the acquisition by millions of dollars usd).\n I’m not looking for comments on getting clean or other judgements at this phase - I have my own plans for how I’m going to achieve that once the financial aspect of the sale and related earn-outs are completed…. But I do want to better understand the risks id be taking if I travel to VN and going through customs with oxy pills.\n Can someone help clarify what the laws are? Especially for USA foreigners traveling for work?\n To be clear - I don’t have a script and when I travel in the USA I just put them in a pill bottle for an old unrelated medication. Considering doing the same here - but haven’t travelled to VN before and I’m seeing conflicting details on the web about our drug laws and related punishments.\n Thanks for your help and non judgement!\n    submitted by    /u/Hockeyhock  \n [link]   [comments]",

Compared to the US were almost 50% of married people will get a divorce. That is about a 10x of the rate in US. Anyone has some light to shed on the reason why this is the case? Comment from article. \n  \nLowest Divorce Rate in the World Vietnam possesses the lowest divorce rate in the world, at 0.2 per 1,000 people. This is an impressive feat for a country with a population of over 97 million, as it indicates that couples in the region are more likely to stay together than those living elsewhere in the world. In addition to this, Vietnam has one of the highest marriage rates overall. The culture puts considerable emphasis on family and loyalty within relationships, which helps explain why divorce rates are so low. Furthermore, marriage is seen as a means of protection from poverty or any other form of financial instability as couples share costs and resources. Finally, societal norms and expectations play a major role; especially amongst older generations who frown upon divorce and may even threaten older married couples with social exclusion if they decide to end their marriages. All these factors combine to result in very low divorce rates in Vietnam compared to other countries around the world.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/kirsion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was learning brazilian portuguese independently and noticed some similarities with Vietnamese. For example the use of the ~ tilde accent mark, and the \"nh\" constant cluster sounding like \"y\".

More specifically, will the data be in the local language? / Do you need to have proficiency in the local language in order to find a job in the field?\n 2) Is it sensible for a foreigner to search for those types of job or will a local professional always be preferred?\n 3) Briefly, how would you describe your experience in this field here in Vietnam or East Asia as a foreigner? Positives, negatives, up, downs?\n 4) Finally, do you have any tips or recommendations?\n Thought this may be useful for any foreigner wondering about their career in Asia.\n    submitted by    /u/Zech-17  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know reddit is not the best place for to ask for advice on life changing decisions, but I'm struggling to make a decision. I've booked a flight to Vietnam, which is less than 1 month away, but I'm on the verge of canceling the whole thing. \n To give a bit of background, I've lived in the UK for almost half of my life. I left Vietnam during my high school years and have been working/studying here ever since. I have a good job, earning well above average wage and I'm happy with all aspects of my life here. \n I go back to Vietnam once in a while and was surprised by how much things have changed. There definitely are a lot of opportunities there, especially when it comes to having your own start up firm, and potentially earn way more than if I continue as a salary worker in the UK after taking into account of the cost of living. That and the fact that my parents are getting old and I want to spend time with them, made me want to go back. \n However, within the last 2 months, as I've been saying goodbye to everything and everyone I know here, I just feel a sense of sadness that I'm leaving my comfortable life and good career behind for something that might not work out. I feel like I might be making a big mistake. To make it worse, I'm almost certain now that my relationships with my parents are beyond repair, and we won't get along no matter what. \n My flight is just a few weeks away and I feel very much like just not going to the airport, and just telling my boss that I'm not leaving anymore and going back to the way it was before.\n I'm just posting it on here in the slim chance that someone might have been in the same boat and have some advice to offer.\n    submitted by    /u/Own-Status-4060  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Một ngày nóng nực như mọi ngày, cuộc sống vẫn cứ tiếp diễn y hệt vậy. Từ sau lần cuối xảy ra sự kiện đó, chúng ta đã quá quen thuộc với cái nóng và đã dần thích nghi với nó. Đã gần 300 năm kể từ khi những con quái vật từ trong mặt trời xuất hiện. Chúng ta đã chiến đấu và kết quả nhận được là sự diệt vong trên diện rộng do bão mặt trời từ những con quái vật gây ra. Trong một khu bảo an cuối cùng của nhân loại. Cương vội rít nhẹ điếu thuốc lá có thể xem là còn sót lại cuối cùng trên vũ trụ này. Vốn dĩ anh không hề thích thuốc lá, nhưng từ sau khi chứng kiến Dương, người bạn thân giàu sinh ra tử cùng mình lại biến mất một cách bí ẩn thì anh ta cũng đã thay đổi thói quen và tính cách. Ngày hôm nay cũng như mọi ngày Cương vẫn vậy. Tay cầm khẩu súng và leo lên trạm quan sát. Từ góc nhìn này anh có thể nhìn thấy toàn cảnh khu bảo an. Những đứa nhóc chạy chơi xung quanh những bãi cỏ bị cháy và những người lớn đang canh tác trên những cánh đồng khô héo, xa hơn có thể thấy những thành phố mà anh chỉ được nghe kể về thời kỳ mà con người vẫn còn làm chủ hành tinh này từ những người lớn tuổi. Bất giác anh như vô thức lau đi những giọt mồ hôi chen lẫn nước mắt khi nghĩ về nó. Rồi anh lại hướng mắt xa hơn về phía đó. Bất chợt anh thấy từ xa có vẻ có người đang đi về phía trại bảo an. Ngay lập tức anh ra hiệu cảnh báo để toàn trại vào trạng thái chiến đấu. Các hệ thống cảnh báo vang lên gầm rú như tiếng súng nổ. Các ụ súng và hệ thống tên lửa được kích hoạt, các chiến binh đều đã vào hệ thống công sự để phòng thủ. Bất ngờ Cương vội ra hiệu tắt hệ thống cảnh báo và phòng thủ vì hình như anh nhận ra điều gì đó... Hết tập 1... Mình mới tập viết truyện để giải sầu vì cuộc sống thực nó quá tiêu cực với mình.

          "description": "Have you guys heard any stories from your parents about period 1975 - 1986 in Vietnam?\n The period of the “Subsidy Economy” (Bao cap) (1975-1986) has been known as a time of hardships, when mechanism for socio-economic management was inappropriate, causing privations in people’s material and spiritual life. Material life was poor due to a sluggish and inefficient production system, but the constraints also applied to people’s creative and spiritual endeavors.\n “Bao cap” was a period during which both the courage and intelligence of millions of people were suppressed and were anxious about liberation. It was a dramatic period, and a profound lesson about the law of social development.\n During this period, food, goods, and services were purchased with coupons or food stamps. Those with a position in government received more coupons and had access to special shops. For those without special status, they could expect to spend almost a day waiting in line to buy rice and other basic commodities. Everything was controlled by the government. Having a bicycle – even one that was ancient and on the verge of breakdown – was considered a luxury. If you were fortunate enough to own one, you'd be on a special list of bicycle owners allowed to buy parts (such as inner tubes, nuts, bolts, etc.).\n My parents met each other in an illiteracy eradication class. They also told me that when they finished secondary, people ran through backgrounds check (which side you supported during the war) and eventually my parents couldn’t go to high school. Can you guys share your family’s stories regarding this period?\n    submitted by    /u/Sophia_Doan  \n [link]   [comments]",

He speaks German well, so there is no language barrier between us. We hang out and really hit it off. We are at the same age, so we have many things in common. I showed signs of interest many times but he hasn’t asked me to be his girlfriend. I think I am quite pretty blonde, so he may find me attractive. Are Vietnamese guys shy to show their interest? Or they only want serious relationship with Vietnamese girls.

          "description": "From the west we obviously have a reputation for drinking too much hard liquor and far too frequently. \n But I enjoy a beer about as often as Vietnamese do. \n That is, on special occasions or social gatherings. \n My problem is how much beer. I like 1-2 decent quality beers and some good relaxed conversation.\n But I find over here my cup just keeps getting refilled. 4,5,6,7 beers later and the case is empty. It's just too much for my stomach or bladder to handle to be honest. I didn't even drink like that when I was a delinquent teenager. \n People start getting obnoxious and getting me to say rude and inappropriate things in Vietnamese (which I don't speak very well). And they try to make me say it over and over and over again because they're totally wasted. \n I miss that culture of the west where you can take part in the drinking circle and everyone just drinks as much as they feel like. No pressure to gulp down 5L each. \n I honestly like the taste of Tiger. It's a pretty good beer for a mass-produced brew. \n But I've had to completely give up social drinking while I'm here. My body just can't handle that much anymore. I'm only 27 but I take antidepressants. \n I don't like to drink alone and my wife doesn't like beer. \n So that's my story. This Canadian is done drinking beer. I like the taste, hate the drunk. \n Not meant to be derogatory at all. This is just me expressing myself. I understand every culture is different and I've taken part in the drinking circle once with every new group I meet just to build that trust with them. But from then on I just refuse. It never just stops at 1-2 beers. \n Also, ice in warm beer? Cold out of the fridge man. Cold out of the fridge. Completely ruins the taste for me.\n    submitted by    /u/FoxResponsible4790  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I speak English originally but I would like to learn this language and visit Vietnam one day. Duolingo and the books I got are helping me understand grammar and how to read the language bit by bit, but I SUCK at speaking it, and I know I do. And I don't know any native speakers personally anymore to help correct my pronunciation. I think I end up overthinking and trying to implement the tones but in doing this I just mess the whole word up lol.\n I've tried saying phrases and words really slow then gradually increasing speed til at a normal speaking cadence and this helps a bit but I was wondering if there was something more efficient. Also I feel like due to my natural voice being kind of deep/bassy and the sort of hard way I tend to pronounce things the naturally softer or more nuanced sounds are kind of harsher than the audio samples I'm hearing. I'm just really having a hard time with this because my voice is deep and somewhat monotone unless I'm excited about something so it's hard to do the tones and when I do I feel like I'm over emphasizing them.\n It's bad enough I tend to even stutter a bit more than usual in English too but I completely butcher this beautiful language almost every time it comes out of my mouth. And I wanna be able to speak to native speakers but not laughably 💀 I know most people are gracious and kind enough to just appreciate you even took the time but still why do it if not correctly?\n    submitted by    /u/Fuckredditlowkey  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know that I probably won't be able to find an ART practicioner while in Hanoi so was wondering what the next best thing may be. For context ART basically involves hitting certain pressure points in soft tissue and manipulating the muscles around them through releases (i know just sounds a regular massage but it's been much more effective than say Thai massages I've had in the past).

          "description": "I decided to book a spontaneous trip to Hanoi and will land on September 15th. I'm super confused by all the conflicting information online about where to go/not to go due to the rainy season. \n E.g. I'd love to do Ninh Bing (both Tam Coc and Trang An) but some websites say definitely don't due to typhoons whilst others say it'll be good cos it's the low season. All i've got booked so far are 2 nights in Hanoi and have ~10 more days to plan. I'll be flying out from HMC September 30. \n Basically where should I definitely avoid?\n    submitted by    /u/myusernamestaken  \n [link]   [comments]",
