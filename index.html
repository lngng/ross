                              <span>I moved to the US when I was young so I&#x27;m not well-versed in Vietnamese cuisine, though when I visited my auntie in another state she asked for a side bowl of nước béo and was surprised that I didn&#x27;t know what it was. Are there any other food where an add-on is not on the menu but can be order? It would be a shame to missed out on good flavor. Thank you.

                              <span>So Vietnamese uses the Latin alphabet. But it used Chinese characters/Chữ Nôm up until French colonialism. From what I can tell in Vietnam proper the Latin alphabet is used basically exclusively. But in my local diaspora community and other places I still see Chinese characters along side the Latin script. 
 Is it just because they’re such deep diaspora? Or is there another reason.

                              <span>I’d like to preface this by saying that I absolutely LOVE Vietnam. I have previously lived here for 8 years and have just returned for 5 weeks. And as an American, I understand intimately that no country is perfect. But,
 Vietnamese bedding is the worst I&#x27;ve ever known. The fabrics are scratchy, the blankets are tiny, and the fabric designs look like they are from the imagination of a blind goblin. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible to make so many colors clash all at once.
 My Viet wife says it&#x27;s China&#x27;s fault.
 Edit: This is half satire. Amuse yourself at my expense, I enjoy it.

                              <span>Can anybody help me with this? We were hiking liang bang peak today and noticed multiple burning spots on the way up. On the way down a whole section of the forest was burning but no one of the cars passing by see es to even notice. My question is, is this normal? And why????

                              <span>These fuckers work like scammers, yet there&#x27;s no one ever questioning or trying to do anything about it. 
 -Unblockable fuckers like Home Credit. They just fucking keep messaging you and the best you could do was deleting message history. 
 -Random people adding you to random unblockable group chat. You have 0 idea who was the fucker who added you there. You can&#x27;t turn off that function where people add you to random group chat either.
 -&quot;Explore&quot;/&quot;Khám phá&quot; tab that is unable to be removed. The elderly who are not fluent with smartphones keep randomly subcribed for random shits in this tab. 
 Edit: Forgot about this shit too: old files keep getting deleted. They are not even that old and you can&#x27;t control it either. Can&#x27;t increase or decrease the time where Zalo considers it to be old. -Suggestion of random people which I&#x27;m sure 90% don&#x27;t give a shit about. Like if you wanted to add somebody as friend on Zalo, you usually take their numbers and add them. Not from suggestion. That&#x27;s like the entire fucking point of Zalo: Phone numbers with a profile. It&#x27;s the most useless shit ever and it has no right to be on &quot;message&quot; tab. Like Zalo is trying too fucking hard to become like Facebook or some shit. Zalo is forgetting their original users and Vietnamese are too forgiving.

                              <span>I booked a grabbike in ho chi Minh and the driver jumped a signal and made the pedestrians stop crossing the road. One pissed off tourist was about to smack my head and not the drivers head which pissed me off. I am a tourist as well. It just didn&#x27;t make sense that he redirected all his anger towards me and started abusing and showing his middle finger. I know he is justified to get angry with the driving by the grab driver, but to almost take it out on me looked incredibly stupid.

                              <span>I am currently a foreign resident living in the US, but I am planning to move to Vietnam as a nomad for a year or more (I hold vietnamese passport, but not a resident). I am interested in opening a bank account in Vietnam that can easily work with USD and international banking accounts such as Bank of America and Capital One. Could you recommend any Vietnam bank account suitable for my requirements?

                              <span>Hello guys my family would like to visit the other family members in vietnam during lunar revel but during this time I need to follow the lectures in germany aka need stable online connections to listen them. Also I need to a do a group project so stable internet is very important for my trip. 
 My mother has already told me that the internet in vietnam is terrible and rarely stable enough for a call. My friend has suggest an internet café where I can use the internet with my laptop. 
 ​
 Perhaps you guys could help me out because I somewhat doubt the fact that there is no good internet in vietnam with the rising of social media etc.

My boyfriend and I want to explore the north of Vietnam on a low budget trip in September and want to have an authentic trip.( we are from Europe) Do you have any tips on the route, things we could do, sightseeing must-sees and also tips on the weather and the costs for such a trip in September, around 3 weeks? We are both very interested in culture and also like surfing and are generally very open minded people. Do you have any tips for a travel experience? we would be very happy... greeting form Austria :)

I&#x27;ve travelled multiple countries in SEA and Some in Europe, I found Vietnamese People to be the most Hospitable and Sweet among all. Everytime i had a conversation with a Local at a Cafe or a Shop, I just had a huge grin on my face because of the way i was treated, Constant smiles, Laughter and Greetings all the way. Few times i thought why they are smiling and giggling so much when i visited smallest of the local shops, Could be they found something funny about me. But it was always a pleasant experience, I joined them in their Giggles. 
 
I have no idea how such amazing Amusement Parks have close to none occupancy in the Holiday Season. I visited Vinwond…</span>

                              <span>So nearly had a crash on the back of a grab bike tonight, it was not my drivers fault at all, basically another scooter veered into us and my driver steered away which then lead us dead on with another car. Luckily my driver &amp; the car both slammed the breaks on, the scooter I was on just bumping slightly into the car infront. 
 Posting this just to say BE SO CAREFUL here on the roads. Even if you&#x27;re on the back of a bike with a grab driver, it is wild. 
 My heart is still racing over an hour later from the ordeal. Absolutely no idea how we got out with no damage and without falling off! 
 Again, if you&#x27;re travelling in vietnam seriously the roads ain&#x27;t no joke here. Be careful. 
 Good luck &amp; stay safe yo!

                              <span>Mình có quen biết một em hàng xóm năm nay học C2. Chơi với nó từ nhỏ nên cái gì nó cũng nói cho mình nghe hết. Hai hôm trước em ấy có kể cho mình một chuyện mà mình k biết phải đưa ra cho em ấy lời khuyên gì nữa. Mình có xin phép em cho mình kể câu chuyện này trên đây để mong mọi ng giúp mình đưa ra lời khuyên. Em ấy kể rằng từ lâu mẹ em ấy đã có thói quen ôm em ấy khi ngủ, hai mẹ con rất thân thiết với nhau. Nhưng bắt đầu lên đầu C2 mẹ của em ấy có những hành vì động chạm vào những chỗ em ấy không thích trên cơ thể với tần suất rất thường xuyên, em ấy nhiều lần tỏ ra khó chịu thâm chí là vô tình đáp trả khi mẹ em ấy có những hành vi đó, nhưng đề bị mẹ em ấy cho ăn đòn thậm chí là chửi mắng thậm tệ. Mẹ em ấy kêu rằng em ấy k thương mẹ nên mới làm như vậy. Mình lần đầu mới nghe trường hợp này, không biết m.ng nghĩ sao ?

                              <span>Hello friendly people, 
 I am visiting your country for the first time with my dad from Armenia, we wanted to explore asia for the first time and my father being a typical anti imperialist leftist he adores Vietnam, I&#x27;m sure you already know your nation has a huge fanbase consisting of boomer leftists. 
 To my question(s): We&#x27;re landing in Hanoi and leaving from Ho Chi Minh City and want to take the train to see the beautiful countryside. We&#x27;re staying from 30th Jan-12th February, coincidentally during Tet Holiday. 
  
Is there a reliable website to buy train tickets in advance?
 Do the train stop at some cities so you can go outside and explore it during a short time between stops?
 Is it worth buying train tickets ASAP since it&#x27;s Tet holiday soon?
 We&#x27;re thinking of either staying in Hoi An one night and continuing the next day, is this something you would recommend or is going straight to HCMC?
  
Thank you and looking forward to visiting your country! 
 Bonus question:
  
Is it offensive if I wear those green short sleeved shirts older Vietnamese men wear as a mediterranean looking guy? I always wanted to rock those shirts and want to fit in/be accepted by Vietnamese people.

                              <span>I loved HCMC and expected to love Hanoi. It’s my first day here and I never want to come back. It’s horrible, it’s dirty, it smells so bad, there’s trash and rubble everywhere and I was not ready to see that much dog meat in the street. I tried walking around diferente areas in the city to see if maybe something changed but it’s all bad. I’ll go to the HCM Mausoleum tomorrow and see if that’s any better but honestly I just want to cry and leave. 
 I’m from Guatemala City and that’s a pretty ugly city + crime is bad and it’s still better than Hanoi in my opinion. Where should I go? I want to give this city a chance.

                              <span>I am an American man (M18) who wants to visit Vietnam relatively soon. I heard there are strict laws about porn. If I were to visit with porn on my phone at all, would I be arrested? It&#x27;s the only law I&#x27;m worried about breaking while I&#x27;m there

                              <span>I have been warned a lot of times about not to carry stuff from strangers/acquaintance/friends/anyone on the airplane, because the stuff may contain harmful drug ingredients. If you get caught in certain countries you may even get death penalty. Some of them go as far as using mind control to make you feel bad if you refuse to do their favor, such as using seniors, disabled people, and orphans as a disguise to ask you to carry stuff on their behalf. In my unpopular opinion, scapegoat seekers (i.e. retards that ask someone to do their dirty jobs while reaping benefits behind the scene) are the WORST HUMANS, COWARDICE ON EARTH, second only to leeches (i.e. people that can read the mood but their skin is so thick that they still cross the line). These kind of “special breeds of people” can be found anywhere in the world, from all backgrounds, ethnic groups, so whoever thinks your background/ethnicity is at play here is FAR WORSE than those aforementioned special breeds.

                              <span>I am a white guy solo traveling in Vietnam. I am currently in Hai Phong. Yesterday some guys invited me to join their table for drinking and eating. They handed me beer, food, rice wine, etc. We kept drinking for quite some time. There was also a bit of weed which they offered me and that I smoked.
 Eventually we go a bit further away, they said to listen to some music. We arrive at some small shop but there is no music. After that I say I am going home and I don&#x27;t need help going home, I can walk. One of the guys insists I go with him on the scooter. Despite the language barrier, I understand it as if he will now drive me home, so I go with him. Instead we drive for a bit with me barely getting closer to my home and we get off at the center square of the city. We talk for a bit and I say I am walking home now, they suggest I take one of the nearby taxis. It feels a bit sketchy for me so I do not take a taxi and I tell the guys I will walk home. I start walking and with an uneasy feeling. There are not many people out at this time. I order a Grab and it arrives quite quick, then I eventually get back to my hotel safely.
 I am not sure what to think of this whole meeting. It should also be mentioned that I did not see anyone paying for the bill at the restaurant, and I got the impression that I was sort of expected to pay for it, since at one time the bill was placed in front of me. I never paid though.
 What do you think? Was I at risk of something happening?

                              <span>I will be traveling Vietnam for a month in March, not sure which city to visit first. I can purchase a multi-city ticket that arrives and departs from either of them for almost the same price as if I did it from the same city. Which part of Vietnam would be better in the beginning of March weather/vibe/events wise? I will spend there maybe a week and move on to the Da Nang area, visit some places in between, then arrive at the other city around a week before departure.

 She said she asked her mom “why?” but her mom never gave her a real answer. Q. Why do we have the same first name? A. Mom “I just like the name.”
 Q. Is this common? A. Her mom would just ask.
 She never really questioned it growing up nor did any of her relative brought it up. But I was over at her house and notice it and asked her. Me and my friend tried searching it up on online but haven’t had much luck in this subject.
 Any experts that can chime in with your knowledge is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I am Canadian and have a Vietnamese passport which my dad help me get. I believe since 2009, Vietnam allows dual citizenship. So does this mean I can own land? What is the RE doing now in areas like Ha Long Bay?

                              <span>Today I was in Saigon - Thao Dien, there was a women being pushed into a taxi, the man forcefully holding her down so she couldn’t escape as well as locking the doors. She was fighting, kicking and crying. Everyone just looked, it was a crowded street, the taxi drove of. I ran after it after a bit of hesitation, luckily there was oncoming traffic so I was able to catch up to the car. I opened the taxi drivers front door and told him to let the women out. He tried unlocking the door but the man locked the door always from inside and yelled at the driver to drive away. Finally I was able to open the door, the women sadly just ran away, I tried to keep the dude contained by holding the door, but he pushed the door open, punched me and then ran after the women. After I got my footing back I ran after them, but I wasn’t able to locate them by foot. I tried asking expats to follow them on the bike but no one wanted to.. so I sprinted to the police in Thao dien, who also seemed disinterested… I don’t know how to feel.

                              <span>Hello everyone! I’m travelling with friends to Vietnam later this January and we’ll be doing the Ha Giang Loop.
 Looking for some information, I came across this beautiful image of somewhere in the north region of Vietnam, touching China. According to the photographer’s caption on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/p/Cwu_Wd6oIUV/?igsh&#x3D;MWMycGgzZWh1bHVjeQ&#x3D;&#x3D;), the mountains at the end of the image are China, and this little river and valley is Vietnam (the northern part).
 Can anyone identify where exactly it is? We’d love to see this in person but the photographer doesn’t respond our messages…
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>My partner and I went hiking through the nattional park near ninh Binh today. When we returned, we discovered several bleeding spots around our ankles in areas that were covered by our socks. These spots were clustered in groups and continued to bleed for a long time. What caused these? Thanks.

                              <span>Chào mn ạ, Hiện tại em rất rất cần người soi đường dẫn lối cho em, e tha thiết xin lời khuyên từ đàn anh đàn chị ạ. Em hiện là sv năm 4, cbi ra trường của một trường khá có tiếng về ngoại ngữ ở hcm. Chuyên ngành của e thì lại k có tính áp dụng cao (thiên về chính trị), đa số quá trình học chủ yếu là chạy dl trên lý thuyết... Nên bây giờ gần ra trường nhưng em lại rất sợ vì không có chuyên môn. Sơ lược thì hiện tại em có Toeic 800+, Vstep B2, em đang có mục tiêu học Tiếng trung và trước khi tốt nghiệp có HSK3. Tuy nhiên, em không biết em phải đi theo con đường gì với những gì e đang có. Đa số bạn em theo Hr, e hướng nội + nhát gan k biết có nên theo không. Em cũng có định hướng theo logistic, và đang có ý định tìm job intern về những mảng này, nhưng chuyên môn em không có gì, ngành học k liên quan nên đa số k ai nhận. Các a chị cho e lời khuyên về con đường e nên theo với những thứ e đang có với ạ. Thời gian này em tiêu cực lắm, đôi khi e còn nghĩ về việc tồi tệ nhất... Nhà e cũng k khá giả, bame mắc nợ nhiều nên e k muốn bị thất nghiệp sau ra trường đâu ạ. Em hi vọng có người chỉ lối cho em vài tháng trước khi em tốt nghiệp ạ. Vài tháng này có thể sẽ thay đổi số phận 1 người được đó ạ 🥺. E bế tắc lắm, e mong có thể có 1 mentor cứu e về tương lai lẫn tinh thần hiện tại...

                              <span>Hi everyone, first ever time posting on reddit and found this community really helpful so far. 
 I am going to Vietnam 20th Jan-9th February with a friend and just wondered if you can drop any tips/advice or anything that might be helpful for first time long distance travellers from the UK! 
 I have tried to work out the travel situation (grab seems good?) and it appears cash is preferred option but also have access to credit card when there. 
 We have booked accommodation in the following areas : Hanoi, halong bay, cat ba national park, nin binh and day trip to cu national park and then back to Hanoi before travelling home. 
 So any places to go/things not to miss and general tips would be so appreciated.

                              <span>My partner and I (Australian) are currently staying at a lovely little Airbnb in Hoi An which is looked after by a delightful young family (as employees). The family has invited us to dinner for the second time. 
 The first meal was amazing and she obviously put in a lot of effort. I’d really like to bring something as a show of appreciation. 
 I was thinking a dessert from a shop in town, or maybe some gifts for their young 8 and 3 year old daughters. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks 🙏

Unfortunately, a a few years after the dad passed away, the next person to have their name on the property is his brother and the brother promised my dad that he will give the house back to him later on when the time is right even though they didn&#x27;t sign any contract because my dad naively believed in him. His brother is now dead and the ownership goes to his wife. My dad expected his sister in law to then rightfully transfer the ownership to him or even half of the house because the sister in law did help the family a lot while my dad was overseas, but she retorted back saying that my dad did not care about the family at all and had contributed nothing so he does not deserve any part of the house. We are going to sue her because we have the papers that prove that my dad did contribute a lot to that house and even my late grandpa acknowledged that in one of his old letters to my dad. The house in question is currently for rent as a business. My dad and I found a lawyer through connections and he said to stop my auntie from potentially selling it later, we must first block her from doing that by depositing 20% value of the house to the funds before the court trial since that&#x27;s how the law works. Is that correct? I&#x27;m trying to find a new lawyer cause I don&#x27;t trust this one and I see him as really incompetent. Pls tell me what I should do next.....

                              <span>Hello everyone. Would have posted under the sticky FAQ, but I believe my questions are a little bit broad for it. Apologies if I should have done so. Have also done a pretty large amount of research online on reddit and elsewhere, but haven&#x27;t quite found what I&#x27;m looking for.
 Arriving 30th Jan, Leaving 13th Feb, flying into Hà Nội. We have a hotel for the first three days, and the plan is by that time to have decided on a next destination, somewhere relatively rural and authentic. We have been planning this for a while (2 Males, early 20s, one English one Aussie), but somehow we managed to miss just how extensive and important Tet is as a holiday, and we feel we may have messed up. Neither of us are able / want to rent bikes, and we have no idea what the transportation situation would loo…</span>

We came back later in the evening and noticed they wrote us a note back. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t translate with my phone. If anyone could help us translate that would be awesome! Thank you!

 We have been going round Vietnam for a week and are experiencing that people all over are coughing and sniffing. Waiters, tourists, pedestrians. We ourselves are all experiencing it and at risk of chest/ throat infections at this stage.

                              <span>Someone in the My An neighbourhood found my debit card, which I stupidly left in the ATM yesterday. I went back to look for it today and found a note taped to the machine!! Someone found it and left it at their hotel front desk, and I was able to get it back when I showed my ID. One thousand thanks. I hope they see this, and that they have good luck for their whole life.

                              <span>Hello! 
 I am visiting for a couple of weeks and wanted to bring my straightening iron from my home country. I will be using an adaptor but am uncertain about the voltage. The iron says 120-240V 50/60Hz
 Will I be able to use this iron with an adaptor when I arrive? Or would the device get fried. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 When I got a chance to travel to SE Asia (once every 4 to 6 years only), I was always buying polos from &#x27;Ralph Lauren&#x27; or &#x27;Lacoste&#x27; on Thailand markets. If you can select the right models and ~haggle well enough you can have good deals.
 Now I&#x27;ll go to Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City / Hanoi) and Laos (Luang Prabang) and would be happy to have your opinion about it. Where to buy? Can you find good quality? Are prices OK?
 Thank you in advance for any &#x27;tip&#x27; or information.

                              <span>there’s an “asian american” accent i’ve heard people talking about, and i’ve always wondered about it. i don’t really know what it is, it’s not really an “accent”, but more an inflection or a manner of speaking that makes you instantly identify the speaker as having an asian background even though you can also tell they’re a native english speaker. even some of my friends who had english as a first language still have traces of this accent.
 i was born and raised in the US but i have a somewhat noticeable accent, cause my parents immigrated shortly before i was born and only spoke viet at home. tbh i’m grateful i don’t just know englsih and can speak viet (not fluently but conversationally) but sometimes it’s hard to speak english after a while living back with my parents lmao. for example some of my vowels and consonants sound viet. words like “cold” i might accidentally pronounced as “code” and “social” as “so sho”, “your” comes out as “yer.” it’s weird when i tell ppl about this bc they’re like “uhhhh weren’t you born in orange county…?” and i’m like “yeah lmao but my english still isn’t great🧐” i still speak english fluently but often it’s hard to express myself fully (without pausing) and pronouncing words that have sounds which don’t exist in VN 
 does anyone else have this “accent”? how do you make it less noticeable?

                              <span>mình nữ hơn 30 tuổi rồi, chưa lập gđ, lông bông trong công việc. Chán nản mọi thứ. Ko kết nối với ai ngoài đời, trên mạng, sống kiểu chảnh cho không muốn giao tiếp vậy. Kiểu t thích một mình. Để t yên đừng có làm phiền. Mình sống tâm lý chán nản ko có động lực trầm cảm lâu rồi, mỗi ngày chỉ ăn ngủ xem phim nghe nhạc chơi game, không làm đc gì kiếm ra tiền, đi làm ở ngoài xh thì mình sợ tiếp xúc nên trốn ở nhà. Rồi ảo tưởng làm idol top top mxh kiếm tiền, nhưng mãi ko thực hiện, đã thử nhưng mình dễ bị nản rồi bỏ dở ko hoạt động. Kiểu mình làm gì cũng chán. Chỉ thích mấy cái tiêu khiển giải trí nghe nhạc xem phim chơi game qua ngày. Đã ngồi vào bàn làm cái gì đó hay để vạch ra kế hoạch tương lai nhưng vẫn là chán. Mình yếu kém, ko có năng lực ko làm đc tích sự gì, kĩ năng giao tiếp kém, mình muốn thay đổi để ko bị coi thường chứ nhưng tinh thần mình trước ngoại cảnh mình hay bị yếu đuối nên kéo theo việc ngáo ngơ dễ bị đánh giá, nên mình tránh tiếp xúc con người.
 Năm mới vẫn vô tích sự như vậy. Mình cảm thấy mình ko theo cái quy luật của cuộc sống đc, ko làm theo những gì người ta vẫn làm theo khuôn khổ.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I planned to travel alone so I booked my flight from south korea to hcmc in feb 4, then return from hanoi in feb 21. And i thought I had plenty of time to spend and travel from hcmc all the way up to sapa and ha giang… but the more i search, more i reliase that i don’t have enough time for all. 
 For now my itinerary looks like this
 Feb 4,5,6 Hcmc
 Ride a overnight train to danang 
 Feb 7 One night in hoi an Feb 8 One night in danang
 morning Flight to hanoi then bus to ninh binh 
 Feb 9,10,11 Two nights in ninh binh
 Return to hanoi, halong bay or cat ba cruise
 Feb 12,13 overnight cruise
 Return to hanoi then night train to sapa
 Feb 14,15,16 two nights in sapa
 Bus to ha giang
 Feb 17,18,19,20 Three nights in ha giang
 Return early to hanoi feb20
 Chill at hanoi feb 21
 Am i putting myself into too much things to do? Tbh if i had known theres not much to enjoy in south i wouldve flown to danang as im more interested in nature and sightseeing. But since i have already booked my ticket and its quite pricy to change it… what could be the best option for now?

                              <span>Happy New Year everyone. Hope your New Year has been good. Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t been good for me at all.
 ​
 I&#x27;m currently in the US for university, forced by my mother to go here. Despite my efforts to convince her that I hate the US, she still signed me up for SAT tutoring, and SAT exam, and also applied to the school I am currently studying at, with the help of a language center. 
 ​
 I have tried to convince her saying I do not want to go to the US, but she doesn&#x27;t care. She is convinced that it is good for me, and even more so since my older brother is also there, who went to and graduated from the same university.
 ​
 I moved here right after finishing high school a few months ago. So now I am here in the US, Alabama (terrible state I know, I was forced to, it was not my choice).…</span>

                              <span>I have a classs A motorbike licence in the UK and thought I would be able to use it in Vietnam to drive legally. After some research this seems to be incorrect? What&#x27;s the relevance of an IDP. I contacted a motorbike company in HCMC and after telling me any bike I bought would be confiscated he is no longer replying.

                              <span>In ha tien and planning to cross over the border into cambodia tomorrow but we dont have any dollars in cash since that isnt our native currency. Checked online for advice and read that you cannot get USD for Dong anywhere in ha tien, as in banks will not exchange money for different currencies. How do we get dollar? I dont want to travel all the way there to be turned away because we dont have dollars in cash. Any advice is appreciated

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 5 months since I set my foot on the US and every day is a living hell to me. I have never really wanted to settle and study here but now it is like I was forced to live like this for possibly years before becoming on my own. It&#x27;s not America per se that is the problem, but the circumstance under which I got here. TL;DR at the end of this Ted talk. 
 To start with, my family really wanted us to study abroad and hopefully move to the US as I grow up, considering my other relatives already living there. Tbh, I had no interest in going to the US to &quot;seek opportunity&quot; and I surmised life would be depressing to me, at least. So I continued minding my own business in high school: making friends, getting grades, dating. In 10th grade, the concern of studying abroad rose to me, but I was …</span>

                              <span>I am white and my boyfriend is Vietnamese. I have celebrated the Lunar New Year with him/his family for the past 3 years, and there&#x27;s a Tết festival we will be attending this year. I would really love to get an ao dai and wear it to the festival- I&#x27;ve only ever worn normal clothes. I think they&#x27;re beautiful and since I plan on marrying my boyfriend I would like to embrace his culture as much as I can. I&#x27;m honestly a little shy to ask him about wearing one, he was born here and is pretty Americanized so I&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s weird if I asked.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve already bought robusta and arabica beans to take home. Seller said arabica is new and robusta is the real vietnam coffee? Didn&#x27;t look much on the brand or if it&#x27;s single origin. 
 Also looking for this weasel and mountain coffee. Is it worth it or just hype? Where to buy them that&#x27;s not in exorbitant prices. I once bought hazelnut roasted beans (not in Vietnam) that smelled so good but was rather bland or weak in taste. Somewhat they took the coffee taste away but infused the smell.
 The coffee flavors here are sweet like those instant 3 in 1. The saigon, egg and salted coffee were the least of my favorites. Coconut coffee is...yeah unique i like the most.

                              <span>Hey, 
 I am photographer from Czechia, Prague, and I am looking for content creators from Vietnam, photographers, youtubers, videographers, etc. I wanna collaborate and create content related to Vietnam. I&#x27;m coming this year in September.

                              <span>I’m Vietnamese-American and was visiting Hanoi for a week. I’ve played pickup basketball in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and saw there were a few nice outdoor courts in HN that I wanted to try out. 
 My experience below was pretty ass. Are there any public pickup spots for basketball in Hanoi? Would love to meet up for some games next year when I’m there. 
 -Sân Bóng Rổ HK Sport: Came at 6pm on a Friday. No entrance fee but zero people at the basketball court. It looked nice though, I left immediately. -Sân Bóng Rổ CLB Ba Đình: Came at 5pm on Friday. Security at the facility main gate said they are fixing the court and it’s closed. Not sure I even went to the right place though. -The New Quarter (612 Đ. Hoàng Hoa Thám, Bưởi, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam): Arrived 6:30pm on Friday. Nice one and half courts. About 25 people mostly teenagers shooting around. A group seemed to have reserved the full court for a party without playing any games. I shot around for an hour before asking to start playing 3’s. After the game ended, some guys said their friends showed up and started their own games.

                              <span>Our hostel warden gave us the worst possible experience just now. We have a booking for 4 of us and we had a friend drop by to our private room to use washroom facilities. The warden threw a hissy fit and started yelling and raising hell and gave us a very rough time. Plus, there was no way to properly explain to him that it was just a friend dropping by a bit, and not an escort - since he doesn’t understand english. 
 He harasses us further by locking us in and not letting our friend out for about an hour. He then threatened to report us to police and demanded money to the tune of 30 million dong (which he said was to pay the cops). He also refused to get us the manager. We are all very shaken by this experience, and are quite convinced it wasn’t lawful at all. After he realised that he wasn’t getting a penny out of us, he calmed down after a bit and opened the shutters.
 What can we do about it?
 P.S: We’re in HCMC, and booked the hostel via Hostelworld.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I’m planning to visit Vietnam in January/February for a bit more than 3 weeks.
 I will arrive in Hanoi and will return from HCMC.
 The idea was to explore the northern part of Vietnam and to do Hi Giang loop, but I understand that it is not recommend due to bad weather ?
 It’s surprising because I have found many website telling that the weather would be cold and dry.
 Any opinions?
 Many thanks !!

                              <span>Hello,
 As many westerns who love to explore eating, I absolutely fell in love with the Bahn Mi; especially Vietnamese Ham (Cha Lua) which I just adore so much I want to make my own. My biggest worry with creating this delectable meat is botulism. I would like to follow the recipe bellow and have all of the ingredients and equipment to do so:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jrXqvP7y0WM
 Is there any risks of botulism by using this method?
 If you make a really big batch can you vacuum pack the rest and store in the freezer? Any botulism or food risk there?
 I really would like to explore this but it is very new for me and I want to be as safe as possible.
 Thank you very much for time.
 Kevin

 As an Indian, I visited Vietnam recently and I noticed that cab drivers, hotel managers, tour guides, or the people in general whom I met welcomed me and showed positive gesture towards me. During my trip, I visited only famous places which are often visited by any tourist. But, I want to understand the sentiment of any Vietnamese towards Indians who not necessarily reside in those cities.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 38M from the US who&#x27;s been living in Vietnam (Saigon) the last couple of months. Last month I&#x27;ve matched with a woman (32F) on Tinder who lives in Tra Vinh. She&#x27;s a university professor and says that she&#x27;s unconventional for her environment (isn&#x27;t looking for marriage and having kids). We&#x27;ve had a couple of video calls and she seems genuine and honest. 
 So she invited me to visit her at her home for a couple of days. Given that I&#x27;m a foreigner in this country it makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable especially because I&#x27;ve never received such an invitation before.
 Am I going to be abducted or am I being a bit paranoid? Anything I should be worried about?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an American living and working in Hanoi. I&#x27;m trying to become more educated on Vietnamese table manners. This topic has been frustrating to me. My Vietnamese girlfriend and my Vietnamese friends have commented on some of my bad table manners. It&#x27;s been difficult for me to try and change my eating habits. 
 Here are some of the things I experienced:
  
Vietnamese share their meals. My girlfriend told me that I should share food so I don&#x27;t appear selfish. Usually in the US, my friends and I would just share an appetizer and then I would just eat the dish I ordered. I also had difficulty adjusting to this because I was concerned with hygiene. 
 Vietnamese aren&#x27;t so finicky with hygiene. My friends share food using the same chopsticks they eat with, and when I have beer with friends they handle the ice cubes with their hands. Surprising at first, but I don&#x27;t make a fuss about it.
 I shouldn&#x27;t accept food using my chopsticks when someone is offering food with their chopsticks. I just did this once, and people told me I shouldn&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;m not sure why it is rude though. 
 I shouldn&#x27;t eat fast. My girlfriend told me it looks bad. I guess I eat fast, but for me it&#x27;s my normal pace. I didn&#x27;t have long lunch breaks in school/work in the US, so I guess that&#x27;s why.
 I have to let old people eat first. I usually don&#x27;t eat with older people, but I was told about this. I had food with a friend&#x27;s family, and I didn&#x27;t eat until her grandparents started eating. 
  
I read a few more online, but I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s true. For example, it&#x27;s unlucky to flip a whole fish when eating. I have a Chinese uncle who that told me about that, but my girlfriend never heard of it.
 I hope I can receive some feedback and tips on improving my table manners.

                              <span>Em hiện giờ đang học lớp 12. Từ khi lên cấp 3 em quyết định đi du học nên em hoàn toàn chăm chú thực hiện mục đích đó thôi - đến trên lớp em cũng chỉ cày điểm ngang mức yêu cầu của bên trường đh đó, còn từ khi lên 12 thì em gần như bỏ hết mấy môn không cần thiết mà chỉ tập trung một vài môn yêu cầu thôi. Thế nhưng mới 2 tuần trước mẹ em lại bị diagnosed with ung thư tử cung giai đoạn cuối ạ. Gia đình em ngoài mẹ ra thì chỉ có nguồn thu nhập là ba em - là giáo viên nên lương ba cũng ko cao. Em thì vẫn ưu tiên việc chữa trị của mẹ nên việc du học ko thực hiện được thì vẫn ok. Nhưng về ngành mà em muốn học (Thiết kế đồ hoạ), thì cả gia đình em đều phản đối nếu học ở Việt Nam í, vì ngành đó ko phát triển ở đây. Ngoài ngành đó ra thì em thực sự không muốn hay đam mê học ngành nào khác. Em cũng chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến việc học ở Việt Nam... Nhưng rồi em cũng chỉ còn 5 tháng nữa để tốt nghiệp thôi ạ, nên cần quyết định càng sớm càng tốt i. 
 Theo mn nghĩ thì em nên take gap year không ạ? Em ko quan tâm đến việc thụt lùi so với mấy bạn đồng lứa hay opinion mấy người xung quanh đâu, chỉ cần là hướng đi tốt thì em sẽ cân nhắc ạ.

                              <span>I’ve been studying Vietnamese for about a month now and I’ve acquired some sentences and words. However, I did notice that there’s two dialects/accents to Vietnamese. When I look on TikTok I always see southern Vietnamese people talking about how the northern accent is complicated and sometimes hard to understand. But at the same time, most Vietnamese songs are written in the northern dialect and most apps only teach the Northern dialect. As a person who lives in the United States, I’ve seen sources state that most Vietnamese Americans speak with the southern dialect. Obviously I would want to make learning Vietnamese as easy as possible by learning the most commonly used dialect or easiest dialect to learn and understand. So this leads me to my question, should I learn the northern or southern dialect?

                              <span>Hello everyone! Planning a two-week trip has proven more challenging than I anticipated, given the overwhelming amount of information available online.
 After extensive research, I&#x27;ve crafted the following itinerary for my travels during the first two weeks of March 2024. I would greatly appreciate your feedback on it, please! 😊 I hope I&#x27;m not missing something amazing.
 I know it&#x27;s impossible to see everything in 13 days, but I&#x27;d like to visit all the best spots, from North to South.
 Day 1 and 2: Hanoi
 Day 3 and 4: Mai Chau
 Day 5 and 6: Halong Bay
 Day 7: Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park
 Day 8: Da Nang
 Day 9 and 10: Hoi An
 Day 11 and 12: Ho Chi Minh
 Day 13: Travel back to home country
 Thanks!

 Can some of you affirm/deny that cocoa powder is / isn&#x27;t infact available in VN?

                              <span>Hi everyone, need some advice for an upcoming trip. I unfortunately will only be in Vietnam for 7 days and am trying to determine if I should change my itinerary as I think it might be too packed.
 My current plan is 2 nights in Saigon (XO Food Tour on motorbike, Cu Chi Tunnels, Mekong Delta), 2 nights in Hoi An (bike tour, basket boats, etc.), and 3 nights in Hanoi (possibly with a trip to Ha Long Bay). I will be flying between all of these.
 Am I doing too much? Should I cut one of these out of my trip and extend time in the other two places?

                              <span>Who has already been to a cruise through Ha Long Bay? I think it&#x27;s very classic tourist stuff, but you probably don&#x27;t want to miss it either. I would like to do a two-day (one night) tour there with my girlfriend. 
 Which providers can you recommend and how can I find a good provider who will give us a nice tour?

                              <span>So I’m a native Vietnamese, born and raised. Left Vietnam 7 years ago to move abroad and haven’t returned since.
 I’m coming back to stay for a year and haven’t been keeping up with the changes in Vietnam. After quite a bit of researching, found surprising amounts of innovations and quality of life changes.
 For example: 
 Grab now offers food/packages/personal items delivery.
 Online transactions are a lot more prominent now than before and of course the growth of massive commerce space like Lazada and shopee
 Paying with virtual wallet is a thing
 My general question is,
 What major quality of life changes have happened the past 7 years?

                              <span>I’ve been getting into Vietnamese music lately and trying to get my wife into it. She doesn’t like any of the Viet rappers because it’s almost always slow rap. Can you guys recommend any good rappers that sound “hard?” Or anyone that raps like BTS. She’s a big fan of theirs.

                              <span>I’m an ethnic Korean that just learned about the horrible things Korea did in Vietnam.
 I’m sorry.
 List of things I learned about today:
 Koreans raping Vietnamese women:

 Ostracized children of rape:

 Examples of Korean-led massacre of Vietnamese civilians:

 If we want any apology or recognition from Japan we must first acknowledge and apologize for this stain on our nation’s soul.
 I’m just kind of in abject horror right now that it took me so long to learn about this.
 I’m sorry.

Starting in Hanoi, I plan to head to Yen Bai in the north early the next day for a 2-day visit before continuing. This region isn&#x27;t often included in travelers&#x27; itineraries—do you think it&#x27;s worthwhile in January? Any city or route recommendations for January would be greatly appreciated! Thank you ☺️

I did the best i can to restore our Vietnamese roots. I’m a buddhist also. I noticed most Vietnamese daughters usually get a Jade Buddha with gold chain necklace pendant. If i have a daughter i would also. My question is. What do i give my son? Would they usually get the same jade buddha necklace also or do they get a jade dragon pendant? Would love to know y’all input. Also my soon to be wife is a Filipina.

 I will be traveling to HCMC in February for 4 weeks. This is my once in a lifetime dream trip and I really want to get the most out of it but I think my itinerary wishlist has grown a little out of control... I&#x27;m hoping people will have input on places to spend 1-2 days (or just skip completely?)
 At a minimum, I&#x27;m hoping to go to: HCMC (both for Tết and for arrival/departure) Phú Quốc Đà Nẵng Huế A cruise at Vịnh Hạ Long, Vịnh Bái Tử Long, or Vịnh Lan Hạ
 The plan is to spend maybe 1 day in Hà Nội
 The nice-to-haves: Cần Thơ, Hội An, Ninh Bình, and Cam Ranh.
 I went for 2 weeks before and was able to visit HCMC, Đà Lạt, Nha Trang, and Vũng Tàu and didn&#x27;t feel it was too much but I think I&#x27;m over the limit this time.
 Sorry... that&#x27;s a lot of info but if anyone has opinions, I would love to hear them! :) Cảm ơn nhiều

 Mình hiểu qua cách chơi đề, bạn ra quán nước chọn một con số rồi chờ cuối ngày đề về. Nếu trùng số thì 1 ăn 70 hay 80 gì đó.
 Nhưng ai là nhà cái, có phải các chủ quán nước tự quản không hay họ có “cấp trên” là nhà cái tổng? Nếu có nhà cái tổng thì các quán nước cấp dưới của họ thu lợi nhuận như thế nào?
 Có hệ thống phân cấp rạch ròi như kiểu một công ty hay Giáo hội không? Các nhà cái có nhà cái cấp trên và cứ thế đi lên tới một ông sếp cuối cùng? Nếu có thì ông này là ai và làm thế nào để ngoi lên được chức đó? Nếu không thì các nhà cái hoạt động như những đơn vị độc lập có cạnh tranh trực tiếp với nhau không và như nào? Họ có tranh giành địa bàn, cạnh tranh tỉ lệ thắng, thâu tóm khách hàng?
 Vai trò của công an trong hệ thống chơi đề như thế nào?

                              <span>Mình có nói chuyện với 1 bạn nữ , cũng được 1 thời gian rồi , nói chuyện cũng khá ổn áp . Nhà hai đứa cũng gần nhau , nên bạn có chủ động hẹn khi nào mình đi ăn vs nhau nha . Nhưng mà không biết khi nào là khi nào :)))) nên mình cứ hay nhắn tin hỏi bạn khi nào rảnh . Bạn vẫn chưa trả lời mình , nhưng có một ngày bạn đi với công ty thì có nhờ mình lên rước về dùm , lúc đó cũng khá khuya 11h hơn rồi nên mình cũng không muốn rủ bạn đi ăn hay gì nữa . Từ lúc đó mình có tiếp tục nhắn tin , điều khó hiểu nhất là bạn đó đổi cái sticker thành trái tim trong khung chat . Nhưng hẹn đi ăn tới giờ vẫn chưa được . Vì lí do bệnh , bạn có nói hết bệnh sẽ kêu mình ... mà hôm qua lại thấy bạn đó đi vs cty .. Cgai khó hiểu thật

                              <span>I&#x27;d appreciate any advice. I&#x27;m wondering if it would be cheaper to book flights within Vietnam (hanoi to HCMC) FROM Vietnam, when I&#x27;m there? As opposed to buying here online from US? Google flights shows flight from hanoi to HCMC for $600usd. If I wait and purchase online from Vietnamese airlines, will I be cheaper? What about once I&#x27;ve arrived and seeing a travel agency for this? Thank you!

                              <span>Hey all,
 ​
 My mates (foreigners) and my gf (Vietnamese) will tour Vietnam in February while she is visiting home for Tet.
 I am planning for an itinerary for Ha Long where I will arrive on the evening of 5th Feb and leave for Hanoi on the 8th of Feb in the early afternoon giving us a full day (7 Feb to plan day activities).
 We have an accommodation planned in Ha Long city for the days. Can anyone suggest if there can be some alternatives to cruise trips for the days that we are there? I have heard about some tours in Cat ba island but not sure how to choose them yet.
 I am looking to find alternatives to the Ha Long cruise for a few reasons - 
 - My gf thinks it&#x27;s dangerous and she doesn&#x27;t want to go on an overnight cruise because she is just visiting there for photos(?)
 - Cruise may be a bit expensive for some of us. I am finding people suggesting against cheaper tours and so may have to look at something atleast upwards of $200 USD for an overnight tour.
 ​
 I am happy to receive any counterarguments and maybe I can convince my gf if there are some suggestions to go for it. 
 Would anyone be able to suggest some tours or any day activities that can get us most of Ha Long/Cat Ba for the duration we are there?
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

Khoảng thời gian trước đó, em thích bạn và bạn đó cũng biết nhưng chỉ muốn làm bạn với em thôi. Sau này, bạn tặng em rất nhiều đồ handmade, skinship hay tựa vào em và còn tặng quà giá trị bất ngờ cho em. Nhưng mỗi khi em đề cập lại chuyện em thích bạn thì bạn lảnh tránh xa việc khác. Thật sự khó ấy mn!!!

                              <span>I plan on being in Ho Chi Minh City during the Super Bowl. Feb 11th, 7am Local time. I realize that Tet (Lunar New Year) is that this time.
 I am a massive NFL fan and would hate to miss the big game. Would I have any options to watch? I would be willing to rent a property with a TV if there a reliable way to stream. Curious is anyone has any experience watching American football in South East Asia. Thanks.

                              <span>chị mình 30 tuổi thất nghiệp ở nhà ăn bám. Tính bả thích núp só chỉ đạo điều khiển thao túng mẹ làm theo cái ý nghĩ trong đầu của bả. Mẹ mình làm có tiền. Chị ấy cứ coi trên các sàn thương mại điện tử Shopee, có ý định đặt những món đồ cho mẹ hoặc đồ trong nhà theo ý của bả, đặt hàng, mẹ phải trả tiền. Mình khuyên mẹ tiền mẹ vất vả kiếm được, mẹ tiêu theo ý mẹ, mẹ mua gì phải theo ý thích của mẹ, đừng để chị ấy chỉ đạo, điều khiển, thao túng mẹ rồi mẹ phải chi tiền, trả tiền, thiệt mẹ thôi, còn chị ấy không mất đồng nào. Có những món đồ hàng về mở ra không dùng được lại phí tiền. Còn những đứa con khác tự mua đồ trong gia đình bằng tiền của bản thân chứ có phải đặt theo ý của bả rồi bắt mẹ trả tiền vậy đâu. Bạn nghĩ sao về trường hợp này? nói thế nào cho mẹ hiểu?

                              <span>Out walking and came upon this lady outside Coffee 31. The line and delivery pickups was crazy. We ordered one based on the line alone and then asked someone else nearby with one what it was. They gave us the name of the dish, xoi xeo, but other than sticky rice and crispy onion, we&#x27;re not sure exactly what all was on it. I only wish we&#x27;d found this earlier because it was quite possibly one of the best things I&#x27;ve had in a long time. Online search wasn&#x27;t helpful and gave variations, I&#x27;m curious what&#x27;s on this one...

                              <span>So I’m currently in Vietnam and I’m starting to realize my preferences. I’m going to break down the cities I like and the cities I don’t like with the hope that people could help give me insight to where I would like to go in the future as I spend 2-3 more weeks here going south. 
 Like: Hanoi, Ha Giang, Ninh Binh, Da Nang
 Dislike: Halong Bay, Hoi An, Sa Pa
 I was thinking of going to Nha Trang, Mu Nue, Dalat, Saigon, and potentially Phu Quoc. 
 I reeeeealy don’t like cities that feel overly touristy and of my three dislikes, they all did to me. Still have some nice things to offer but just not where I feel like being. 
 Any suggestions on my future itinerary in terms of places to add or remove based on my preferences? I am comfortable on a motorbike so that should be considered.

                              <span>I visited Vietnam this earlier this month and just came back recently. I never knew I would like visiting Vietnam that much! 
 I never thought I would want to visit Vietnam again, but now I want to visit every year or every other year if possible. I really enjoyed the food and the shopping, but wasn’t a big fan of the weather (I prefer cold and foggy weather). 
 Maybe it’s because I was always comparing to U.S. prices, but everything was very cheap/affordable. Where I live, it’s easily $17-20 for a bowl of pho or bun bo hue. I ordered 3 bowls of bun bo hue off grab and it was only 160k (the portion sizes are smaller but even if I ate all 3 myself, that’s only about $6.50?) 
 I did a lot of searching on this reddit to see where I should get my hair cut done at. I ended up going to Hair Bar in district 1 - for females, it was 580k for shampoo+mini massage, hair cut, and styling (480k if you want a quick shampoo). I’m sure there are cheaper places, but I wanted to try and get the best if possible. I recommended my sister in law to go there as well, she also enjoyed it.
 For a full body massage, facial, and hair wash, I went to Yushi Clinic Beauty &amp; Spa in district 3 and it was about 840k for a wonderful experience - it was about 2.5 hrs long. It could have been cheaper, but I asked for some add-ons such as the facial and a scalp treatment. 
 For clothes shopping, some of the shops I enjoyed were: Uniqlo SC Studios ($30-110/item ; lots of linen &amp; silk) Rosie ($12-30 for most items, $40-50 for coats) Libe ($12-30/item) Dear Jose ($80+ dresses) Secondee Flanh
 I visited Aufra &amp; Len Clothing as well which had some nice styles, but the quality wasn’t as nice as say, Libe or Rosie, for the same cost. 
 My favorites were SC Studios and Rosie

                              <span>Arrived in Danang 2 days ago. Today I went for haircut and while I was waiting a went to grab a bahn my and there was a bunch of dudes sitting and drinking. One older guy said hello and wanted to shake my hand so I was like okay shook his hand he looked drunk and then after shaking my hand he grabbed my junk and squeezed it I immediately pulled away and turned my back on him and got my bahn my and left without looking at him again. Haircut was very good and man was friendly but that was just very weird and I&#x27;d never expect that from an older gentlemen, maybe a bargirl in thailand perhaps. Any people experience that ? It felt quite violating to be honest.

                              <span>I am really fond of Vietnamese friendliness and hospitality, although there is a minor problem in how the waiting lines work here. I&#x27;ve been in some queues, and especially young adults are those who seem not to care about the line and just cut it for their own good. Imo, it&#x27;s better to ask people when we start queuing whether they are in a line and wait until our turn. I love Viet Nam, but i hope people will eventually get better mindset to be nicer to others. Have a good day, yall.

                              <span>Recently I had a disagreement with my girlfriend who was born in France but half-Vietnamese, and she told me that she preferred to keep everything to herself rather than complain because in Asia people had too much pride to complain, I told her said that I doubt that all Vietnamese will never externalize their problem and let them accumulate and she told me the famous phrase &quot;I am (of) Vietnamese origin so I know my people better than you&quot; so my friends allow me to ask you directly if this is the case or if it is specific to each person

 Things I’m looking into paying for include phone plan, internet, and electricity.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be in Ho Chi Minh twice for a couple of days each in January and would like to have some custom suits made while I&#x27;m there. Right now I&#x27;m leaning towards Binh Tailor as they do women&#x27;s clothing (my wife wants some as well) and they have good reviews. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than I&#x27;d prefer but want something that is good quality. 
 Anyone used them? How did they turn out? Any other places I should check out?

 I am a student at the University of Amsterdam and am currently looking for native Vietnamese synaesthetes as part of an ongoing research project. Synaesthesia is a unique perceptual phenomenon in which someone experiences a merging of their senses, for example, they may experience a colour as a sound or letters as having distinct colours. 
 If you think you might have synaesthesia or know of anyone who has synaesthesia, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out! Your participation in the project will be compensated :)

Staying at Hanoi Old Quarter so somewhere close would be appreciated! :)

And the pieces of information you can get from this article are the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) score and the rank. Also according to the journalist: &quot;The CPI score is still below average, which means the government is still corrupt&quot;. I&#x27;m not expressing my personal opinions here (as my opinions suck), just giving information. Here is the link, by the way: https://nhandan.vn/quyet-liet-ngan-chan-tham-nhung-gop-phan-phat-trien-kinh-te-xa-hoi-post746315.html What do you think? P.S: not to mention the anti-corruption caricatures by Tuổi Trẻ (translation: Youth), which is also state-owned.

Wondering about vegetarian-friendly options, specifically if dishes like Phở chay and Banh mì chay are 100% vegetarian or if they include non-vegetarian elements like chicken broth or oyster sauce. Any tips or pointers on vegetarian street food in Vietnam would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!

 &quot; The article discusses the legal victory of teacher Lê Cao Tánh after being dismissed from his position for 15 years. The incident leading to his dismissal occurred in 2006 when, in response to disruptive behavior from a student, Tánh slapped the student, resulting in a bleeding nose. The school, Trường Nguyễn Du in Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, terminated his employment, citing a violation of the teacher&#x27;s ethical standards.
 Tánh contested the decision and went through a lengthy legal battle, facing initial rejections in both trial and appeal courts. The Supreme People&#x27;s Procuracy intervened, recommending the annulment of the previous judgments. Eventually, in June 2021, the High People&#x27;s Court in Ho Chi Minh…</span>

Do you know of any good places, clubs or even better websites for finding those events? I&#x27;ll be going on a kinda roadtrip (by bus and train) throughout the whole country, so recommendations for all over Vietnam are welcome.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;ve scored a cheap flight, a roundtrip ticket from Hanoi to Siem reap with Vietjet Air. As a budget traveler, i think the price is a good deal. However, I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative reviews with vietjet air about delays and terrible customer service. Has anybody here had experience with Vietjet from Hanoi to Siem reap and how was the experience? also since i dont have checked-in luggage, can i check in online to skip the q at the baggage counter? thank you!

                              <span>Met a nice businessman from Singapore who told me about buying property in Vietnam as an investment. He’s very bullish on the real estate in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. Sounds like a really attractive prospect since I can’t really afford a home in California. 
 Was wondering how this works. I’m assuming it’s frowned upon but also isn’t Vietnam communist? So can one truly purchase land or is it land use rights? Is there a property management industry like the US? Is contract law respected here? Can a foreigner even own land?
 As a fast growing economy I see reason to both allow and limit how foreign investment enters a country (especially after seeing how foreign money came into the states pre-pandemic).
 Disclaimer: I’m just a tourist and I don’t think I’d actually buy here. I don’t have any personal ties here so I’d be too scared to put significant money here. The businessman told me about police bribery and getting screwed over by his last partner here.

                              <span>Hello! I am a young 21 year old female who wants to travel to Vietnam! I was born in California but never traveled to Vietnam before. I am Vietnamese and I understand the language a lot! I can speak and read. I am currently not in college or school due to personal reasons and I want to explore! 
 I do not know anyone in Vietnam. I really want to travel but nobody I know in California can go due to school and work. I saved up a lot of money. I would love to create my own business there one day! My dream business is to create a luxurious spa in Vietnam! 💗💗
 if anyone has advice on traveling alone and starting my own business, please let me know!

                              <span>Hello! I will have a wedding in Ho Chi Minh City in February. I am looking for an ao dai rental shop to rent an ao dai for myself (6 ft 1, &gt;250 lbs), 6 groomsmen, and my dad. I have been searching on Facebook and Google Maps but cannot find a place that carries my size. I prefer &quot;ao tac&quot; or &quot;ao dai gam suong&quot; but at this point, they don&#x27;t matter as long as I can find one that has my size.
 Please let me know if you know a place. Thank you so much.

Trước đây, em chưa đủ chín chắn để suy nghĩ trước khi quyết định làm một việc gì đó, em chỉ nghĩ đến cái vui vẻ nhất thời lúc đó, làm những việc không nghĩ đến hậu quả. Hiện tại khi nghĩ lại những chuyện ngày trước em đã làm trong quá khứ, em cảm thấy chúng như những vết nhơ không thể xoá sạch trong cuộc đời em 😞 em luôn không đủ tự tin, luôn cảm thấy mình không xứng đáng với bất cứ điều gì tốt đẹp. Em thấy bản thân rất tệ và rất kinh tởm dù cho đó là những điều từ quá khứ. Em nên làm gì ạ? 😞

                              <span>I’ll be heading to Vietnam soon for about a month and I take tramadol everyday for arthritis. I can’t find any solid info on whether it’s available over the counter in Vietnam? I have a prescription but it’s an electronic prescription so I’m not sure it’s valid there. 
 Any info much appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read a few fiction books in Vietnamese in the last few years as a way to expand my Vietnamese study in an enjoyable way. I have gotten fairly good at reading now and really enjoy reading Vietnamese as a non-native speaker/reader.
 My 18 yo nephew in-law is Vietnamese, speaks good English and is also starting to read books in English. I want to help find him some appropriate novels to start with, so I&#x27;m interested to see what other Viet-&gt;Eng learners went with when they started reading. 
 He&#x27;s most interested in adventure and detective fiction.

                              <span>as the title says.
 recently my (French) friend who was working in HCMC told me about his Vietnamese teacher&#x27;s &quot;weird lessons&quot;:
  
she took him to a bookstore and grabbed a few 123Vietnamese books (he paid for them)
 &quot;just complete the exercises&quot;
 two (or three, if she&#x27;s free) 1-hour coffee dates each week where they talked about random topics in Vietnamese (he paid for the drinks)
 she would help him translate Vietnamese things via zalo
  
apparently he learned nothing more than what to say after &quot;xin chào&quot; and a few slurs, and he had been learning for almost two months. when i asked about the price, it was around 300,000vnđ / date and a flat fee of 1,500,000đ per month for the zalo help. isn&#x27;t that a lot?
 things were so weird so i had to ask about the teacher herself. and after some quick check on her zalo profile: she was a 20yo university student whose major was definitely not teaching Vietnamese. i felt so bad for the guy and i gave him some advices to look for a new teacher or just go to language center that offers better services.
 this was not a &quot;scam&quot;, just a plain bad way to teach someone Vietnamese while having a fairly high price.
 definitely a scam where she tricked the foreigner into thinking she&#x27;s a professional.
 time is tough recently, i know, but girl (and guy) please, being a Vietnamese does not mean you are allowed to &quot;teach&quot; a foreigner. can you guys just be language exchange partners instead?

 I was hoping someone that is doing the loop would be able to make a slight detour and collect it.
 It is on the main road that is apart of the loop, and approximately 40m off the road in the bush.
 If anyone is able to, I can privately send them the exact coordinates, as well as satellite imagery of the exact location. 
 Offering a 1 Million Vietnamese Dong reward I will also pay for postage of just the SD card, and you may keep the drone if you want.

                              <span>So from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/18ql057
 I saw that many people think that compare a person to a dog is a casual, light-hearted joke. I am not sure about that in western, but in Vietnam, it is totally not true. In Vietnam, compared a person to a dog, no matter your intention, is a serious insult asking for violence. The similar one in the west is &quot;fu*k u bit*h!&quot; or &quot;you son of a bit*h!&quot;. So yeah, just don&#x27;t do it. The only exception is that you intentionally want to insult the other and want to have a fight :)
 Edit: as mentioned by some people &quot;cún&quot; (puppy) is fine for kids and girl friends to show that they are cute and you love them. &quot;chó&quot;, on the other hand, is not ok.

                              <span>Hi r/Vietnam,
 Happy holidays first of all.So I am lucky to be a part of Reddit Collectible Avatar program where Reddit provides a platform for small indie graphic designers like me to sell mascot skins/avatars. Today I have submitted an avatar in the shop with the art style inspired by the traditional Vietnamese lacquer painting: mother-of-pearl art.
 Nacre - the avatar. Find more details about this in my profile link
 As an appreciation for the art influence, I want to do a small giveaway to one member of our sub. To enter, simply reply to this question as a comment to this post: Have you heard about the Reddit Collectible Avatar (before reading this post of course)?Submission closes on Saturday 30.12.2023 at 12 pm CEST, then I will use RedditRaffle to pick a random lucky comment.
 [I have reached out to mods for approval for this giveaway]

                              <span>I want to buy some local goods but edible goods are similar with ehat we have in the PH. I am also seeing a lot of Circle K but it is a convenience store and I believe the supermarket in big stores or &quot;malls&quot; are cheaper.
 Any stores you can recommend? A lot of souvenir shops near Old Quarters but im pretty sure theyre tourist price.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m a 33yo traveling with some friends around Vietnam in February 2024. Would you change anything in this itinerary? It feels a bit rushed.
  
Day 1-3: Hanoi
 Day 4-6: Halong Bay
 Day 7-8: Hue
 Day 9-10: Hoi An
 Day 11-12: Da Nang
 Day 13-15: Ho Chi Minh City
  
Any guidance is appreciated!

                              <span>I would like to purchase some rings, bracelets or necklaces in the above purity in TPHCM.
 Shopping around I managed to scout out a few places (SJC, PNJ, Doji, vendors in gold street in Q5) and the prices/premiums quoted were in the normal range of 1-5% over spot.
 Unfortunately I couldnt get out of the staff whether or not sales tax (10%) was applied to these products or if they are tax free/reduced taxation applies. I cant find anything online really.
 Would somebody here be so kind to enlighten me ?
 Also yes I am aware of the 300g limit of personal gold jewelry when entering/leaving the country.
 Thanks and regards!

                              <span>Hi guys, so I bought a motorbike in Saigon a little over a month ago.
 I took it to Cambodia pretty much immediately. No one batted an eye about the bike. I drove it straight through. Not asked for papers or nothing. Spent a week there and then went back to Vietnam. Same story.
 After spending a few weeks riding up through Vietnam and getting caught in some heavy rainfall and cold as shit weather I figured I&#x27;d cross over to Laos and get some sun.
 I was wrong. I tried crossing the border near Khe Sanh, I think it was called Lao Bao. They wouldn&#x27;t let me take the bike. Didn&#x27;t even ask for the papers, just straight up no.
 Should I try a different crossing? How do I get my bike into Laos? Would love to get some tips on this.

                              <span>Not sure if anyone has noticed but there are quite a few older korean men in vietnam, more specifically here in Da Nang that are with thin, small framed Vietnamese girls. They literally just go on dates and sit there without saying a word to each other. 
 What is this? Is this some sort of rent a girlfriend service or sugar daddy/sugar baby relationship?

                              <span>Pictures were taken using Nikon d7000. Hoping you guys will like it as much as I do. 
 Also, some of you may notice that colors maybe dull or too bright, this is because I am still new to photography and I am on the stage of testing waters while on manual mode. Cheers everyone!

                              <span>Hi all, this will be my first time travelling to Vietnam and will be going to Da Nang after reading/hearing about how nice the city is. We are heading over in a weeks time. 
 My partner and I are big foodies and all the travel blogs we&#x27;ve seen have shown how well priced and good the food is there (especially seafood). 
 What are your recommendations for any specific street food shops/markets/restaurants in Da Nang?
 My understanding is seafood will be the focus but all recommendations welcome. 
 Of course, any pho and bahn mi recommendations are a must-have too.

                              <span>So there&#x27;s a small situation. Earlier this morning i got some errands to run with my mom at Phan Thiet, Binh Thuan. We supposed to meet a friend of my mom around district 9 then he drived us all to Phan Thiet. We couldn&#x27;t find a proper parking slot but a nice household let we parked at their home. The thing is there is no ticket required. Even though i have some small bumps of uncertainties, i still gamble over the kindness and friendliness in Vietnamese. It may be my overthinking mind. It would be extremely helpful for me to know what is your opinion about this. Thanks a lot. Have a great day too.

                              <span>Hi!
 My parents immigrated a few years before I was born in the US. I have a bit of family back home whom I&#x27;ve only met once. But of course I understand it&#x27;s very tough back home and my family struggles often with money. 
 One of my cousins is graduating high school this year and I just learned today that her parents are in no place to afford college tuition. They&#x27;ve all resigned themselves to that reality. My older cousin (different parents) also couldn&#x27;t go to college and she makes 7 million a month, and the cycle of economic struggle persists. I&#x27;m in a position to send money for my little cousin&#x27;s tuition, unfortunately couldn&#x27;t help my older cousin in the same way. It is a no brainer for me. However, I want understanding of what higher education in Vietnam entails. More so out of curiosity and wanting to show support in learning about her experience than anything else.
 What is the cost? My family is based in Saigon, what are the schools nearby like, I don&#x27;t think she is interested in being too far from family. Is it difficult to get into universities? What opportunities does a college degree afford? Googling I found the average entry level salary for a college graduate is 20-25 million. Any other information that comes to mind that I didn&#x27;t think of?
 My mother didn&#x27;t finish 8th grade due to poverty and hardship. My brother and I now have master&#x27;s degrees, it is her greatest pride. I&#x27;m now a teacher, nothing is more important to me than education and knowledge. Thank you so much for helping me become better informed!!!

                              <span>I left my laptop at the security scan @ Noi Bai airport last week. I didn&#x27;t realize this until I had flown back to Canada, my home country. Noi Bai&#x27;s lost and found website shows they have it in their possession (they take pictures and post them on their website of all of their lost items). I have hired a vietnamese interpreter to speak to staff there, however they are saying it&#x27;s not their responsibility to put the lost item on the plane and that it is the responsibility of the airlines. I have contacted Japan airlines, the airline I flew on and their customer service is telling me it is the responsibility of the security/lost &amp; found staff, so now I&#x27;m in this circle of each party saying it&#x27;s the other person&#x27;s responsbility. Has anyone on here ever lost something at Noi Bai? Can you tell me the steps you took to retrieve your item? (This is a laptop by the way) Any help here would be greatly appreciated as it has just about been two weeks and a dozen phone calls and I have gotten absolutely nowhere.

                              <span>I have a theory, and I&#x27;m hoping someone here can confirm or debunk it for me.
 I spent the weekend celebrating Christmas in Tam Đảo (it was lovely, thank you, merry Christmas), and I saw something that I&#x27;ve only seen a couple of times over the many years that I have lived here, but I think there has to be a reason behind it.
 Two big, black, brand new SUVs drove by with the blue government plates, then a meticulously upkept early 90&#x27;s Toyota corolla, then two more fancy SUVs with government plates, and the guy in the corolla was dressed very well, clearly had money.
 Now, my theory is super wealthy people in VN have their cars from the early 90&#x27;s, and because they&#x27;re really rich, they&#x27;re perfectly taken care of. And the reason for showing off such a generic, low-end car is because they are conveying that they are rich enough and important enough that they were able to afford a car in the early 90&#x27;s, when this was an extreme rarity. 
 Is this a real thing, or is there some other reason for this? Because I have only seen it a few times, but it has been more than once, so there has to be some reason that wealthy/well-connected people would choose to drive a 90&#x27;s corolla or equivalent level car, right?

                              <span>A Vietnamese comment on Reddit told me that I am not Vietnamese if I don&#x27;t see the fact the majority of people in Vietnam removed the right-side mirror of their motorcycle (if there are 7 motorcycles in the street, there are 5 motorcycles that have been removed the right-side mirror). But I don&#x27;t see that in my city (Da Nang) and other Vietnamese cities I have traveled to. The vast majority of bikes have two mirrors on both sides. The percentage of bikes with the right-side mirror removed is so low that it is unnoticeable. This percentage may be as high as the percentage of motorbikes that lost the left-side mirror or the motorbikes that lost mirrors on both sides.
 Another Reddit comment assumes that I am Vietnamese but living overseas. And so on....
 I brought it to a Vietnamese forum VOZ and asked if the experience of Reddit Vietnamese matched what happens in the place Vozer lives, they confirmed it was real. Maybe they joke to me, I don&#x27;t know. But If people are joking, please stop, I don&#x27;t know what is joking and what is real. What I see with my own eyes from when I was born to now (being a 25-year-old man) is not something people in Reddit and Voz described.
 I am Vietnamese but people say that I am not Vietnamese, even when I have written in Vietnamese in a local/urban/vulgar style that only Vietnamese use. They just said to me that I use Google, Google Translate, ChatGPT, or AI to pretend I am Vietnamese. It is kind of sad.

                              <span>Saw some expired sandwich on the shelf ( already expired for 1.5 days). The store is not that crowd so I guess the staff doesnt bother to check. Should I tell her secretly or just simply walk away?

                              <span>Mình post lên đây để mọi người đề phòng với hội này.
 Hải SapaTV là 1 kênh youtube ẩm thực thuộc diện lớn ở VN, với hơn 1 triệu người đăng ký, nhiều đầu mối bán hàng, có nhà hàng và khách sạn ở Sapa, và quan hệ rộng. Trước gia đình mình các cụ ở nhà rảnh rỗi hay xem. Thấy nó quảng cáo bán hàng khá hấp dẫn nên vừa rồi các cụ cũng đặt mua hàng.
 Mặt hàng này là thịt trâu gác bếp (thịt trâu sấy khô). Quảng cáo là để trong tủ đá trữ được 6 tháng. Bán khá đắt (1 triệu vnd / 1kg) nên mình hi vọng chất lượng tốt. 
 Không ngờ mua về để tủ đá, mới được hơn 1 tuần thì 1 gói đã mốc trắng như vậy.
 Mình gọi điện đường dây nóng phản ánh với chủ shop thì chủ shop mồm năm miệng mười, nói lấn át cả khách, đổ lỗi cho khách bảo quản.
 Mình để cả 2 gói trong tủ đá, nếu do bảo quản thì cả 2 phải bị chứ. Chưa kể trong tủ đá còn rất nhiều đồ ăn khô không bị làm sao.
 Theo mình suy đoán thì vì bán nhiều hàng nên nó làm láo, trộng hàng cũ vào bán cho khách online. Ai không cẩn thận là ăn phải hàng ôi thiu. 
 Mình post lên để mọi người đề phòng với kênh youtube và hội này. Đừng để vừa mất tiền vừa mua tức vào người.
 Long story short, if you don’t know Vietnamese, stay away from SapaTV food, restaurants, and hotel. I bought their products and receive old, rotten food.

                              <span>I dont understand why some restaurants only serve buffet when there are 2 or more customers. I know they will get more profit if they do that but on the hand, if the restaurant fits one&#x27;s favor, they will comeback overtime,so technically it&#x27;s the same. It is frustrating that my friend cant come with me to high-class buffet( due to overpriced) and they dont serve only one customer.

                              <span>I’m traveling from the US to Vietnam soon for an extended period and would like to keep my US number to receive 2FA sms for US banks and apps. I’m looking into using a plan from Tello mobile as a cheap option. I read that Tello doesn’t offer roaming, but enabling wifi-calling would allow me to receive 2FA messages from the US. However, I saw somewhere that says Vietnam does not allow wifi-calling and so this option would not work. Does anyone have similar experiences that can help shed light on whether this is true? Thanks!

This is what we were planning to do, take a day cruise that picks us up from Hanoi and leaves us at Cat Ba at the end of the night, we spend a night, go to the national park the next day and come back to Hanoi. Does this make sense, or shall we spend an extra day in Cat ba? which hotel would you recommend and which activities?

 Is this something that most people do? I had a quick Google but couldn&#x27;t find anything.

                              <span>When I first noticed this on a scooter, I thought maybe they were too poor to replace it. I thought it looks ridiculous. I&#x27;ve heard that only the left is required by law. Do locals remove it because they think mirrors look uncool? I really don&#x27;t understand the point in it, even if you don&#x27;t look in the mirrors, why remove them? I don&#x27;t recall noticing it anywhere else in southeast Asia. Since then I&#x27;ve noticed maybe 40% or more of the scooters in my area only keep a small left mirror on the bike, especially Vario drivers... I drive a Vario myself and look in the right mirror a lot to keep an eye out for any ninjas creeping up to overtake me on the right side.

                              <span>To my backround, Im a viet born and raised in germany, now Im in vietnam for 2 months to mainly learn the language. Back to the topic. So Im 17 yo guy, naturally my family is starting to ask &quot;hey you got a girlfriend yet?&quot;, of course no, so they reply with &quot;oh how about finding a girlfriend here, marry and bring her back to german?&quot;. I was a bit put off because in germany (or west) people marry in a much older age and woman want alot of privacy and freedom. I doubt that that these days girls in VN would want to marry that quick and leave their country, but Im not sure with my lack of knowledge so how is your guys views on this stuff?
 Edit: Thanks for the replies. I dont actually think of doing it lol.

                              <span>Oh my gosh. I am from the philippines and i did not expect that it would be that cool/chilly here. Our tour guide informed us that it is 12°C here and in Hanoi it would reach to 10°C.
 Where do i find cheap jackets to help me with the weather? Im staying in Grand Menora Danang Hotel. Any night markets near here?

 I have noticed a lot of Christmas things here in Hanoi - but I always thinks it’s made for the tourists? 
 I’m really curious about the traditions here

                              <span>Xin chao,
 Next month I intend to cycle from HCMC to Hanoi, with roughly the following itinerary over 28 days:
 HCMC - Vung Tau - La Gi - Mui Ne - Thap Cham - Da Lat - Nha Trang - Tuy Hoa - Quy Nhon
 (bus to Kon Tum) - Mang Den - Da Ban - Quang Ngai - Hoi An - Da Nang - Hue
 (train to Ninh Binh) - Tam Coc loop - (train to Hanoi)
 Ideally I want to spend 2+ days in the larger places mentioned and 3 in the big cities. Now the questions:
 ​
  
If I dismantle my touring bike (front wheel off) and have it bagged, is it possible to transport it on a bus if I want to &quot;skip&quot; a stage (due to bad weather, injury, etc.) - e.g. Quy Nhon -&gt; Kon Tum
 How easy is it to ride out of HCMC towards Vung Tau?
 Away from the coast, is it necessary to book hotels/guesthouses in advance, or can you just show up on the day and realistically expect a room? (my dates don&#x27;t overlap with Tet). Ideally I&#x27;d like to save weight and not have to bring a tent or wild camp.
 I only finalised this trip last week, so probably won&#x27;t be able to learn/speak much Tieng Viet language, and my tonal pronunciation will probably be wrong. Is this likely to be a big barrier in the rural parts of the Central Highlands?
 Do most hotels/guesthouses/hostels accept card payment?
 For trains (e.g. Hue to Ninh Binh) do tickets (particularly for travellers with bicycles) need to be reserved a day in advance?
 Are there any parts of that itinerary that you reckon should be skipped given that it&#x27;s January?
 And are there any sights you would really recommend that I&#x27;ve not included? (I&#x27;ve excluded Sapa, Ha Giang and Dien Bien Phu given that presumably it&#x27;s pretty cold (&lt;10 degrees) at this time of year, and I would guess the earliest days of February in Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay can still be foggy, so I&#x27;d leave that for a summer trip, given I only have 28 days). The karst caves at Phong Nga are, I guess, probably tricky to reach on a bicycle too.
  
Cam on rat nhieu.

                              <span>Hey,
 Just wondering about the title.
 From my time I met with a Vietnamese woman. She was married but wore no ring. Said he husband cheats on her but she couldn&#x27;t leave him because it was frowned upon by her family unless she had someone else who could look after her. Even then her family would have to go to his to make the arrangements for her to leave him. 
 Is divorce really looked down upon in Vietnam or is this bullshit?

                              <span>Hi, I am having some Vietnamese relatives over for the holidays and I was wondering what Vietnamese food or snacks are good with beer? I.e. someone suggested quail eggs as one, but I was wondering what else does everyone like?

                              <span>Hi, I currently having to deal with 2 packages delivering to Vietnam. One of them in from USPS departed to HCM city and one is DHL. How long does USPS going to ship to Vietnam? I’ve never seen anyone successfully receive their package from US to Vietnam through USPS. 
 One more package I have is using DHL to ship, from Germany to Vietnam. However the package lost update since November 6 and my seller filed for lost parcel. But on December 15 the tracking was back but it has been stuck in customs since then.
 I don’t know what to do besides waiting, but I know where the package is because it shows me the address where the package is at, can I just go to that address and get my package immediately or I need to wait for the customs and god knows how long. Some said that I need to pay import taxes but I thought that items that are over 2,000,000vnd doesn’t require to pay tax. Does anyone know what to do??? It’s so complicated.

 Hegel was one of a series of German philosophers (including Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Marx) in the 18th and 19th centuries who wrote on the subject of historical and social progress. Speaking very broadly, the idea is something like this: A, society exists in a certain state, with certain rules and traditions and practices. B, the limitations of these rules and traditions and practices prompt a reaction against them. C, the established system and the reaction against it combine to form a new system, informed by both, which then becomes part A of a new cycle. A, ,B and C are often called &quot;thesis&quot;, &quot;antithesis&quot; and &quot;synthesis&quot;.
 Now, you can apply this pattern very broadly, to describe the foundations of epistemology - exploring how human knowledge arises from combining the abstr…</span>

                              <span>Currently in Hue checking out the tombs and the imperial citadel. Weather in Central Vietnam has been quite cold and rainy so far. My brother and I want to do the Ha Giang Loop around the end of this month but reading online, some people say around this time the weather may not make it worthwhile (foggy, etc). Do you think it&#x27;s still worth doing?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been living in Vietnam for a year, and some things about the culture I find genuinely bizarre. 
 Around the corner from my place is a big bia hơi kinda place, and there are always 3 or 4 guys stood in the road trying to flag people down, waving at them, even jumping in front of bikes from time to time. 
 Of course, I&#x27;m well travelled and people trying to stop pedestrians is common all over the world, but vehicles? In my mind, I rarely drive around aimlessly, if I&#x27;m on my bike it means I am going somewhere, why would I go into these places on a whim? I have never once seen anyone stop for one of these people, so... What&#x27;s the point? It&#x27;s just an annoyance it seems. 
 Maybe I&#x27;m missing something but it seems pretty odd.

                              <span>Many people in this subreddit say they teach English, but if you are from a Vietnamese family, what is it like to learn English?
 Possible points to contemplate:
  
How does English compare with tiếng Việt?
 Are you perchance the first, second, or third of your family line to become fluent English?
 Do you use English with your family?
 Did you have to go overseas to perfect your English?
 Has English skill given you notable opportunities?
 Have you had interesting instructors?
  
I am not Vietnamese, but I find it pleasant to talk with Vietnamese citizens and Việt kiều in this forum.

                              <span>Hi all, I got locked out of my account recently. I tried to contact Momo over the phone but every time it speaks a few sentences and then hangs up automatically. I’ve also emailed them multiple times and they always just say wait 2 business days. It’s been more than a week now. Does anyone know how to reach support, preferably in English? I don’t know any Vietnamese unfortunately. Thanks for all your help!
 Sorry in advance if this type of post is not allowed.

 I see many Vietnamese be able to calculate and sell and do business really well, it just seems like it&#x27;s a big part of the culture too, to hustle and to work hard on their business.

                              <span>Hi, all! I&#x27;m currently comparing options for Vietnam tours for late February, 2024. There are two that are extremely similar-- same tour company, similar price, almost identical destinations-- except that one travels to Hoi An and one travels to the Mai Chau Valley. I love visiting historical sites and especially UNESCO World Heritage landmarks, but I&#x27;ve read that Hoi An is very touristy and a bit of a let-down for some Redditors. Mai Chau Valley looks breathtaking and a bit more off the beaten path, but I could use some opinions on it from people who have been there.
 Which of these tours would you pick?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m an American-born Vietnamese, Mom came here in the nineties and recently became a naturalized US Citizen. My mom has her original birth certificate from Binh Dinh (pretty old and raggedy at this point lol) and she wants me to find out how to get her dual citizenship/Vietnamese passport. She&#x27;s been thinking about returning to Vietnam to retire soon and be with her siblings who stayed in Vietnam.
 Any other VK&#x27;s here done this before? I&#x27;d love to get details and specifics - A lot of conflicting information online along with just outright confusing info so it&#x27;d be nice to actually hear from others who&#x27;ve done this. 
 I&#x27;ve tried emailing and calling the consulate and embassy in the US as well but they&#x27;ve been surprisingly unhelpful and unresponsive lmao.

                              <span>Hello All! Hope everyone is well! I&#x27;m from Singapore.
 I&#x27;m planning to solo travel/ backpack for the first time ever to different countries in SEA in Jan 2024. Preferably starting from 3 Jan - 16 Jan 2024. I&#x27;m planning to stay in a hostel. Main point of this trip is to learn new culture, explore amazing cuisines, do fun local activities, meet new people, relax, enjoy, take amazing pictures and create awesome memories!
 I think Sapa &amp; Hanoi in Vietnam would be a great choice! 
 What do you think? Anyone can share with me travel tips or where else I can go in Vietnam in Jan 2024?

 How can I submit my tax report?
 How often do I have to do this?

                              <span>Im travelling to Vietnam from Sydney, and im thinking of using a Wise debit card and Wise convertion since its charges really low rates (less than 1%) https://wise.com/au/
 Would I be able to use the Wise debit card in Vietnam? I am going to all the major cities in 14 days, I am doing a tour so most of the stuff like accommodation and domestic flights are all already paid but I still need cash to get food and etc.
 Using my regular bank card ANZ or Commonwealth kinda sucks because its 3% conversion rate. What is the best way to get money out from atms in Vietnam?

 Interesting to see, but wasn’t expecting this traffic tonight.

                              <span>I looked for some guides on the internet about this, but most of them are from Americans or Europeans, and their dating cultures are so different from each other and from Vietnamese that I don&#x27;t think I can learn anything from them. So I really need some insight from my fellow people. Here are my questions:
  
Outside of online dating, how did you meet your gf and ex? Are most of them previously your friends, your coworkers, someone you were already familiar with? Or just strangers you bumped into?
 When you&#x27;re interested in a girl, how do you approach her? My understanding is that you&#x27;d ask her out for a coffee, a milk tea, right? How successful were you? How often did you get rejected? If rejected, do you just move on and ask the next girl you&#x27;re interested in, or do you persist and try again later? Are you usually interested in a lot of girls at once, or just focus on one target?
 If she accepts your invitation for a milk tea, how often did it turn into an official relationship? I mean, is dating supposed to be a numbers game where you repeatedly ask a lot of girls out, repeatedly go out with a lot of girls, just to successfully obtain a gf once in a while (let alone a wife)? I see that most people enter a relationship very easily, so it can&#x27;t be that tedious, right?

                              <span>Hey! ;)
 My Vietnamese fiancée and me (from Germany) will celebrate our wedding in Đà Nẵng next year in early September. We are looking for a band who can perform both Vietnamese songs and English rock/alternative/pop music. We are planning a wedding that will combine both Vietnamese and &quot;Western&quot; traditions - and, of course, our own wishes and visions. 
 We expect around a hundred guests. Most guests will be from Vietnam, but many people from Germany and other nations from around the world will hopefully join. So, it will be wonderful to have people from all over the world to come together, celebrate and connect with one another. We hope a band will be able to play a set before dinner and one afterwards. So, maybe around 3-4 hours in total. Afterwards, we will have a DJ put on some music and we invite the band members to join and celebrate with us. 
 If you or someone you know might be interested, please message me! ;) Looking forward to hear from you!
 All best
 Niko

                              <span>I&#x27;m into listening(podcasts)/watching(YouTube)/reading about murder mysteries/unsolved cases/crime stories. I am Viet Kieu and can understand and speak Vietnamese. I am trying to learn to read/write in Vietnamese. Out of all the stories that I&#x27;ve heard about, it&#x27;s very rare that I hear a story from Vietnam. A few months ago, I heard about Dung Hà (Vietnamese female gangster) and found her story quite fascinating. I was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction (YouTube, podcast, websites, books) where I can learn more stories such as this? I&#x27;d really appreciate it!

                              <span>Hey!
 I’m an American born Vietnamese who would like to re-learn the language after 20 some odd years of not being fluent.
 My mom re-married after immigrating to America and our household was fully English speaking from the time I was 9 so it sort of fell to the wayside.
 I can listen and comprehend okay (still pretty bad) but my speaking is garbage to put it lightly.
 I’ve tried using duo lingo but I think the dialect is mostly northern whereas my family and friends are from the south so that’s what I would like to focus my learning around.
 Of course I can always speak to my mom now but she’s not really equipped to “teach” it so to speak.
 What are some good resources online? Is it worth it to find a private tutor? I know a few viet friends who learned/perfected their English by watching tv, can the same be said about consuming Vietnamese media with English subtitles? Is that even a thing?
 I think my biggest hurdle is embarrassment/awkwardness when it comes to talking, I lose confidence and don’t want to sound like an idiot so it’s hard to stay consistent.
 Any ideas?

 ​
 Is it worth staying in Can Tho for 2 nights, or since we really only have like 1.5 days in HCMC, we should skip staying in Can Tho and just take a day trip?

 I know it is normal for me to prepare li xi for my younger cousins and for when I arrive and leave but I’m not sure how much is reasonable to give, I’m thinking around 1,000,000dong each time is a bit much because I have 10 aunts and uncles and each of them have 2-3 child…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a VN born, naturalized US citizen. I want to get a VN passport. How much does the VN consular charge for such service? Anyone done it before in the States?

                              <span>Hello! Sorry if this is more suited for the sticky thread, but its quite specific.
 I was adopted from Hanoi in 1992 and I am currently visiting Vietnam and Hanoi.
 I wanted to show the adoption clinic to my children but neither me nor my parents remember the address(we visited the facility in 2008/2009). I am aware that we need permission to enter the facility but we only want to see the outside.
 The only information I have is that the clinic was called &quot;B clinic&quot; or &quot;Clinic B&quot; back in 1992 and I believe it was still in operation in 2008/2009. However the name can have changed. 
 Any information is of value as we leave Hanoi on the 23rd of December and only have tomorrow to find and visit the facility.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Might not be a Vietnam first but it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve personally seen a western family of 4 on a Honda wave in vn.
 Man, woman, 2 small children. Can&#x27;t recall if the children were helmeted... But left me feeling it&#x27;s a new milestone.... Rather than Migrant workers coming to vn on their own or possibly in pairs, Migrant families living daily life in the city. It felt real off.

                              <span>am at the beggining of a motorcycle trip starting in HCMC and aiming to travel in the length of country. I&#x27;ve loved my time here so far and looking forward to the rest of the trip!
 I bought a motorbike in HCMC, a Yamaha T135, which has served me well the first week. However I obviously wasn&#x27;t thorough enough when inspecting it since I&#x27;ve only just realised the indicators are not orange but blue! I&#x27;m pretty sure its the bulbs themselves since the light housing is clear plastic. 
 My question to those in the know - is this illegal? Will I get pulled over by police as I travel from HCMC to Hanoi/Hai Gaing loop?
 I haven&#x27;t seen any other bikes with coloured indicators so far so a bit worried to be honest

I&#x27;m looking to purchase a Honda Winner X 2022 V3 (Red Color/Special Edition/ABS) in Hanoi, and I&#x27;ve heard second-hand might be the way to go. Any recommendations for trustworthy retailers in the city? Also, any advice on what to look out for and the legal procedures for a foreigner to acquire a motorbike in Vietnam? Considering having my Vietnamese wife buy it – thoughts on that? Appreciate all your insights! 🙌

As you can tell, these two places are.. EXTREMELY different. So.. to those who are Vietnamese but don’t live there.. What are some things you guys do that reminds you of Vietnam? Certain activities, places.. Etc..

                              <span>Please see screenshot for understanding of my question. 
 Are both usage of “tìm” correct? First screenshot accepts tìm but second doesn’t allow. When should I use “tìm thấy” vs “tìm”?
 Please also explain giúp versus giúp đỡ. Reason is one lesson I Learn it didnt allow me to use giúp đỡ tôi and corrected me with giúp tôi. Why is that? Does đỡ modified the word giúp? 
 Thanks. Cảm ơn.

                              <span>My coworker is an older gentleman who fought in Vietnam. He keeps a lot of pictures and memorabilia of his time there. He’s not sure where this picture came from, its relation to the Vietnam war, or if it was even taken in Vietnam. We couldn’t find anyone who knew how to translate it as most Asian Americans we asked said it wasn’t their language and even if it was they don’t read only speak. We think it’s written in Vietnamese but someone told us it was Chinese. Any ideas?

 They don&#x27;t tell you at check-in either, just with security officers at the boarding gate. So if you&#x27;ve purchased liquids in the terminal they will confiscate them.
 If you ever have the chance, please let them know that they are full of shit, because we just checked with Australian Biosecurity here and they have confirmed that policy is an airline policy even though when you are boarding the plane they claim it is an Australian policy.
 Probably just trying to force you to purchase their cash only in-flight beverages.
 F*** VietJet.
 Edit: To be absolutely clear, we are talking about an additional restriction at the boarding gate, not the normal security check where we all know liquids must be surrendered. This applies to all liquids purchased in the terminal after security screening.

                              <span>Hello. I’m coming out to South East Asia the end of January and was wondering how much Ha Giang gets effected by the burning season. My plan was to do Thailand first(chiang mai before burning season) and then hit Vietnam in late February/march. Now I’m worried Ha Giang(what I want to do most) will be low visibility due to the smoke. Is February/March a bad time to do Ha Giang with visibility?

I was quite surprised by her views on relationship and marriage and so I was wondering if she is a successful/known/famous author in Vietnam.
 Moreover, if you have good Vietnamese authors to recommend to me do not hesitate!

                              <span>Took the bike over from Nha Trang today to check out what looked like a cool stretch of coastline. I could see from Google maps that there was a load of resorts along the stretch of beach by Cam Ranh airport, but it just seemed so surreal driving around there! Surely none of them are ever anywhere near capacity? We saw nobody around apart from workers who were mostly just chilling out outside of the gated resorts. Are they laundering projects? The upkeep must be so expensive. Does anyone know what it was like on this stretch of beach before they were all built? Just curious!

                              <span>Hi, I didnt know where to post his but I hope I can get some answers.
 I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. I have read multiple places that Phu Quoc is overdeveloped and does not give you that &quot;island life&quot; feeling. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
  
Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :) Thank you for all answers!

                              <span>Sorry for the rant. But some of the public colleges and primary-high schools in HCM City keep setting back the GODDAMN TIME in which morning classes start. The old time usually was 7:15 or 7:30am, then it back to 7am, and now it become 6:45am (Some schools like HCMC University of Industry and Trade set to as early as 6:30am)
 When asked about this decision, 2 of the most popular answers from the school speaker are: - To avoid heavy traffic --&gt; They seriously thought &quot;If the traffic is usually jammed at 7am, then why don&#x27;t we just start the school at 6:45am?&quot;. To me, this is such a dangerous one-sided thinking, which disregard students whose houses are very far from school. Doesn&#x27;t even mention student now even have less time for breakfast anymore if they wake up at 6 o&#x27;clock or later. Plus, people who don&#x27;t want to deal with heavy traffic are already aware to get up early, you don&#x27;t need to force everyone has to go more earlier, as long as they go to school before it starts.
  
To prevent student from coming late to class and to encourage them to wake up early--&gt; There is no scientific research stated that the earlier the school start, the lower the student coming to school late. School in US and Europe begin at atleast 8 am so student can have good sleep, which they&#x27;ve done countless researches before. Again, dangerous one-sided thinking to me. As a grad student, I have twice to tripple amount of assignments despite sleeping less comparing to my time in high school. From my experience, it encourages more people to go to class late lol. My friends said this is dumb, and they ended up always going late or only go to second class (8:30 - 10:10am).
  
Sorry if you find this rant and broken English annoying. I&#x27;m 2nd year grad student and I&#x27;m tired of waking up in 5am so that I can take buses in 5:40 to get to school in time. The reason I wrote this post so I can relieve some stress from constant complaining against my school. Hope you forgive me.

                              <span>I&#x27;m 24 and a local here (hcmc, vietnam). I found 2 great friends in real life from this sub reddit and wanna test my luck this time. Also, my roommate/best friend is getting married so I&#x27;m feeling a bit lonely idk 😕 About me: I play games but not so good with it, just average I think (LoL, Valorant, CSGO, DST, overcooked etc.). LGBT+ friendly and open minded (I do know that some ppl do claim that they&#x27;re but they actually dont but this is what ppl around comment about me so I think its reliable 😂). I&#x27;m not so good with recommending cool food places cuz I mostly order food to my house 🥲 Good hidden bars, coffee shops yeah I can do. I read manga and watch anime too but wouldnt say I know many good ones. I draw as a side hobbies, not so much recently but yeah I do love art. Have tattoos, I can recommend some good tattoo artists that I mainly go to here. I have depression, anxiety, bipolar and a bit of adhd (thats a lot isnt it 🤡) but Im highly self aware and well put together most of the time. Last but not least 😂 I&#x27;m a libra.

                              <span>I am a white guy visiting my wife’s family in a pretty rural part of Vietnam. Our sleeper bus stopped on the way and I went in to use the urinal taking the first empty one (there was probably 50 urinals mostly empty). Some guy comes in right after me and takes the urinal right next to me, then proceeds to just stare over the divider at my junk very obviously for a good 20 seconds. It was very obvious since he peaked his entire head over the divider multiple times. Eventually I gave up on peeing and left to use a stall cause I felt too uncomfortable. Any advice on what I should do in that situation? Do you say something or just walk away like I did? Is this common?

                              <span>Sorry if this is not the right place to post this but I just want to get this off my chest to s community like this. For some context I was born in Hanoi and adopted into a US family at 8 months old - I have nothing as far of information regarding my parents, just my birthday and where I was found abandoned. I got the chance to visit Vietnam for the first time in 16 years since I was born last month. I got to experience the city and the wonderful people and I got to go to my orphanage. I got back to the US just 2 weeks ago and I just miss Vietnam so much - part of it just feels like home to me and I just miss the whole vibe and general culture of the country. I have never traveled to a place where I just felt so in place and “normal” with people who were genuinely interested in me and cared about me. It honestly was an experience nice and feeling that I really cannot put into words. I am not normally a person to express my emotions like this but I just had to get it out somehow sorry this was more of a post about my feelings and more about myself 😅. Anyways thanks for reading - sending love ❤️.

                              <span>Arrived at Tan Son Nhat and called a GrabCar to my hotel in District 1 since it was 100k vnd opposed to the 300k-400k vnd quoted by the taxi stands.
 After a few minutes trying to find my driver in the parking lot at the Arrivals exit, he helped load my full size luggage and medium totebag into the trunk while I carried my pet carrier with me into the back seat.
 About 5 minutes into the ride, the driver motions a hand gesture towards his tummy and realize he is trying to say he has a stomach ache and needs to find a restroom en route. He gets on his phone and coordinates with another driver to take me in their car instead. We stop at a gas station, and I get out with my pet carrier and begin to get into the other car. My driver opens the trunk to retrieve my luggage, closes the trunk lid right away and holds up a 100k bill to show me as he hands it to the new driver. I am in agreement as it seems fine with the exchange of funds to the new driver, and I pay the first driver once my ride completes.
 As I am about to enter the new car, I realize I am missing my large totebag. I tell my original driver, hey I&#x27;m missing my other bag. So I go over to the car and he opens the trunk and reaches in and retrieves my totebag. I see the totebag is placed in the trunk in a small, recessed area that just seemed odd. I didn&#x27;t think much of all this at first, but at the end of the day, this incident has kept me thinking I was trying to be robbed. My totebag contained all my essential items.
 tldr: grabcar drivers says he is sick minutes into a ride, gets me a replacement car and driver and forgets to transfer all my luggage to new car.

                              <span>Hi, I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
 Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :)
  
Thank you for all answers!

Bản thân em thì công việc cũng ổn định, có 1 khoản tiết kiệm khoảng 400tr, nuôi 1 bé mèo. Cũng lâu rồi em không yêu đương gì nên thấy độc thân cũng quen. Hồi xưa đi học còn hơi hướng ngoại nhưng giờ cuộc sống chỉ quanh quẩn đi làm rồi về nhà, đi ăn với bạn thân, dần dần em lười bắt đầu một mối quan hệ mới luôn. Cũng không phải là không có ai tán mà thực sự em không có hứng thú luôn ấy ạ (mặc dù e vẫn là gái thẳng). Không biết có chị nào từng giống em mà cưới chồng rồi có thể cho em xin lời khuyên được không ạ? Em cảm ơn.

                              <span>I sorta want to learn to read and write chữ nôm, and that would requite me to learn Chinese. What dialect would I learn? Before the arrival of the Jesuits and French, Vietnamese was written in chữ nôm, which were Chinese characters modified to write Vietnamese. In order to read and write this script, one probably had to have a good understanding of Chinese. But what dialect of Chinese did chữ nôm writers speak? It probably was not Mandarin, as that was spoken in northern China, ~2000 miles away from Vietnam. Chinese rule of Vietnam ended in the 10th century, so there must have been some drift in the Chinese dialect the literate Vietnamese knew and the dialects the Chinese spoke.

I&#x27;ve heard of shopee (not available to download in the US), Lazara, and tiki but I believe they are similar to Amazon so I&#x27;m not quite sure about quality control (there are reviews of course). For context, I&#x27;m based in the US and would like to get groceries for my relatives in VN once in awhile. TYIA!

I want to start from the end and say that ultimately nothing happened to us, and we continue to enjoy our trip here.
 My partner and I are visiting Vietnam and we are currently in Hanoi. Last evening we were walking around the Hoàn Kiếm area, when at some point a man seemed to have offered us something (I did not hear/understand). I have simply politely responded &quot;no thanks&quot; and my partner and I continued walking. From that point, I could see from the corner of my eye he was walking behind us. We did not interact further. At some point, he passed us and was now ahead of us by a few steps. Whenever we stopped (to look at our map, cons…</span>

 Do you think it&#x27;s impossible in my case to get a job in Vietnam? What about the visa?
 I am a French Software developer with 3 years of experience, both in France and Germany.
 I am fluent in English and French. I know that recruitment policies rightfully prioritize locals, but I would appreciate your opinion about this topic! or even some feedbacks.
 Thanks for your answers :)

I&#x27;m not accusing the entire sub of being these stereotypers as most of the replies are level-headed, but there are still some things I just wanna get off my chest as a non-native who was raised in Vietnam.
  
The accusations of racism.
  
Whilst it is true that Vietnam is a racist country, I find it absolutely ridiculous that people seem to be stereotyping the entire nation as being racists. I myself whilst not exactly dark skinned, have seen a lot of darker skinned Viets living life normally. Matter of fact- a big majority of Viets are tanned, regardless of class.

On the way, we see a bike lying on the side of the road. I immediately stop and see two kids (maybe 17-18) lying there in a puddle of blood. I stop the bike, jump off, and run over to them and notice that one kid has two huge holes in his head and his face is completely covered in blood. The other kid is alright, just a scratch across his face from the pavement, but visibly shocked trying to shake his friend. Some people are standing in the distance just looking, while his head is lying on the side of the road.
 I hold his head up, his blood is pouring all over me. I try to wave to people passing by, and every single person stops, looks, shrugs, and keeps going. Not a sin…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I have tried drugs pretty much from every class. Weed, traditional psychedelics, stimulants, dissociatives and sedatives. I have experience with relatively high dose of shrooms and LSD, also with vaping and smoking DMT. I&#x27;m familiar with the feeling those all share to some extent. I have done high dose of edible cannabis multiple times too.
 Tonight I was alone in a bar in Vietnam and a guy asked me to join their table. I joined them and we enjoyed some beer and tried to have a conversation even though they didn&#x27;t really speak english. They had a shisha on the table and offered it for me and I smoked it few times. It was my first time doing shisha, everything seemed just normal, it tasted like mellow strawberry. Bar staff was taking care of the shisha so I believe it was just an or…</span>

                              <span>I’m currently in Hanoi, and a friend managed to buy a Grab jacket for me as a souvenir during my last trip.
 I know it sounds weird, but I figure other tourists have tshirts (which I do as well), but buying a jacket is unique, and it really reminds me of being in Vietnam.
 My friend is refusing to help me look for a BE jacket this time; he says it’s the “uniform of the poor”.
 So, I’m on my own on this endeavour. How would I buy one, despite not being able to speak Vietnamese?

                              <span>I recently saved $1M USD after working/investing in the US for 8 years and am 29 now. I&#x27;m tired of living in the US as an Asian American with all the violence and crime and unsafe cities here.
 What would life be like in VN with this amount of savings at a relatively young age? Thanks for any advice or perspective.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in vietnam for over 2 weeks now and I&#x27;ve been really depressed about the racism I&#x27;m facing here. To give some context, I&#x27;m chinese and indian, quite dark skinned, female. 
 The counts of racism I&#x27;ve faced here is absolutely disheartening, maybe because of my background, I tend to notice the implicates of it. Other - I&#x27;ve been really well behaved, trying to break the misconceptions about my countrie(s) not because I deliberately want to, but because that&#x27;s how I am. I&#x27;m introverted, am always polite, tip well, do not indulge in the bad stuff. 
  
At the hotel I was in, I saw white tourists get upgraded and also an Asian Australian man get upgraded (their original rooms were not available). In my case I was asked to wait 3 hours for my room, when I asked if I could pay for a better room, they happily obliged. This happened on the same day, around the same time. 
 
Customer service - Specually in hotels again, I saw how other customers were treated over me. Unfortunately, I did notice a theme going around with the skin tone. I saw a couple who came in after me order much more elaborate dishes, it was only after they finished almost eating, was I served my very simple dish. 
 
The cherry on top, I took a tour to a popular tourist guide with a English speaking tour guide, he went on to speak about how brown skin is not considered beautiful in vietnam, that it&#x27;s ugly, relates to poor and bad behavior as he himself was brown, he did not have good experiences in vietnam with his love life, job etc.. this really broke my heart. This country is supposed to have the kindest of people, having read the previous threads too, I didn&#x27;t expect to have this experience in Vietnam of all places. 
 
 I just wanted to share this with all the people of colour who keep asking this question if the vietnamese are racist. Here&#x27;s your answer. Ofcourse, it&#x27;s not as blatant, or direct, but hurtful nonetheless.

 I wondered if there was anyone from Vietnam able to forward some products from Lazada through to the UK - at a fee, of course - it is just some T Shirts! 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am heading to Vietnam next week. My first destination will be Da Nang and I’m not sure where to stay there because I have seen one of the posts in this channel is about how bad the hotels are in Vietnam. I am planning to stay in Da Nang then will head to North towards Ha Long. Any recommendations would be perfect, thanks folks!

                              <span>Hello guys, my friends and I will be travelling to Saigon. Our flight is scheduled to land at around 1 AM in Saigon. We booked an Airbnb but we’re only allowed to check in by 12 NN. I was wondering are there any 24-hour spots in District 1 where we can stay while waiting for our check-in.
 I’d love to hear if you guys have other tips for us on our situation. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey, so Im a 17 yo german/viet guy and will travel to vietnam for some time and I was wondering how you would actually make friends in vietnam, especially people my age. 
 So my vietnamese is really bad thats why I will probably just stick to english, the question for me is, how widely spoken is english in vietnam these days? Can I help people trying to learn german? Are there any social activities I could participate in? Any tourist spot recommendations?
 Any answer is appreciated!

                              <span>Hello.
 I m european and i will travel to Vietnam by plane to sign on container vessel, i m a seafarer. I have in my checked luggage a 2.5kg sealed bag containing GymBeam True Whey ( protein powder ). One friend of my father scared me and told me that custom agents are very corrupt and if they see that I m european, they will demand money and if i refuse they will even go far as replacing my protein powder with some drugs to convict and jail me. 
 I told him that he s crazy but now i m a bit worried. Can i take my protein with me or should i leave home. I would probably come by plane from Instanbul or Doha.

                              <span>I’m 29f getting engaged to 30m, we’re both Vietnamese but my side does not know anything about this ceremony and his side wants to do it. Everything is mostly taken care of except we don’t know the step of how everything will play out, and supposedly we need a representative to speak and read out the schedule for the day, which we have no clue. Like do I wait with the bridesmaid to accept the gift from the groomsmen or do I stay hidden? Do I serve them tea after? And then his mom give me jewelry? Does anyone have their dam hoi day schedule so I have an idea

                              <span>Alright, first of all, I&#x27;m a Vietnamese. Using English here, because well, why the hell not?
 University in this nation just feels forced. Not like &quot;conscription&quot; stuff but, keeps organizing random events and forces students to participate, and if not, deduct bunch of &quot;diem ren luyen&quot; or whatever. I just feel like students should have the rights to whether to go or not. Like recently, my university had some sort of Shoppe-sponsored event and of course, to make the sponsors happy, they force every students to attend, standing in the sun for 1 hour then listen to annoying love-related songs about bunch of &quot;I love you then you dump me&quot; non-sense. Or forcing students to clean up construction debris in the university. Wow, unpaid working. 10/10, Law university. And upcoming, another sport event that if they didn&#x27;t threaten to deduct points, probably no one would attend because 90% of the students aren&#x27;t bothered to wake up at 8AM in Sunday, just to watch bunch of fellow university students playing badmintons and running.
 I understand the morality behind the non-sense of that points system, for &quot;đánh giá về phẩm chất chính trị, đạo đức, lối sống của sinh viên trên năm mặt đánh giá&quot; but using this so that the teachers can prove that &quot;my university organizes events and the students are totally not enforced to come and this will do very well for publicity&quot; is not really a good excuse to use this points system. Because some university students have their own life to deal with and should not be forced to participate in events that for a lack of better words, they don&#x27;t give a f- about (there&#x27;re defo better words). Just because you can do something doesn&#x27;t mean you should. Students have their own life and you having free time doesn&#x27;t mean you should torture the students.

                              <span>So I am a Vinasun or Grab user usually but my colleague got me turned onto this new Vinfast vehicle based service and it’s now hard to go back. These cars are new, clean, and don’t have plastic on the roof…always wondered what kind of bloody crime occurs in these taxis that a plastic lined roof is necessary…
 Anyways, what are your thoughts? Anyone else enjoying this new service?

                              <span>I’m going to vietnam next week and I went to search up on items to declare while clearing the customs. One of the items is cash.
 Apparently vietnam customs allow you to bring $5000USD or equivalent foreign currencies in cash without a need to declare. But for their own currency, they only allow travellers to bring in 15million VND which is $620USD equivalent. Anymore than 15million VND in cash has to be declared. That is so weird? Anyone has any experience of bringing in more than 15million dongs in vietnam? Do you actually need to declare? If you did, what did they do? Do they just straight up confiscate the difference?
 Edit: People seem confused so I’ll explain further: 
 Guys I am talking about arrivals. Not departure. I’m BRINGING IN 30million dong cash to vietnam to SPEND. I’m NOT BRINGING VND OUT of vietnam. I dont understand why would they limit the bringing of their currency that’s the most legal and accepted to be used in their country so severely. It’s like they are trying to create more business for the money changers there.

                              <span>Is it just me or have you noticed the same. It seems to me that the driving style in Vietnam seems to be slower then for example in Thailand or the west. I don’t know how to describe it. I felt the same in Laos. Some sort of socialist driving style. Maybe it is also because there are so many motorcycles and most look identical. What’s your take on it?

                              <span>Can there be widespread development and well-being in a socialist country like Vietnam?
 Vingroup seems to me to be the classic case of parastatal corruption. They promised to build homes for the people by converting rural areas but then built luxury homes that are inaccessible and currently empty. 
 It seems to me that in VN no one cares about voting and that all they have faith in the government. 
 It seems to me to be a country destined to become a new China if the people do not demand democracy and the fight against corruption. 
 At today we never saw a country without democracy grow up with a stable well-being and in my opinion VN people they need to fight more for their rights.
 What do you think? Why Vietnamese trust this gov?

                              <span>How much should an insurance company pay for the following: 
  
Outpatient treatment 
 Inpatient treatment 
  Medical evacuation to my home country 
 Repatriate remains
  
Is outpatient coverage necessary here as treatment in Vietnam is super cheap? 
 How long should the waiting period for cancer or illnesses? Some insurance companies have a 12 month waiting period for cancer which is ridiculous in my opinion. 
 Thank you so much

                              <span>Husband and I will travel for 2 weeks starting from SGN and end in Hanoi from February 28- March 13th. We were thinking of taking the train up the coast and stopping off at Sapa, Nha Trang, Hue, and still deciding. We like to adventure, eat good food, and not be in touristy scenes if possible! Where we else should we definitely stop and where have you stayed that you enjoyed? Ok with private rooms in hostels, hotels, other unique experiences. Should we book ahead of time or wait til we get there? Thank you 💞💞💞

                              <span>Been here for a while now and I am honestly SO tired of being misled by top tier hotel reviews online that turn out to be rigged or fake. Every “well-reviewed” hotel or accommodation (even higher end ones) I’ve stayed in was so terrible (or subpar at best) despite raving reviews online which leads me to believe it’s all fake and manipulated. 
 Then, whenever you leave an honest review or comment on booking.com or google that isn’t a 9 or 10, hotel staff will literally track you down on your personal whatsapp or e-mail to emotionally blackmail you urging you to delete or edit your comment, or worse! They will even threaten you! 
 Pictures on websites are insanely misleading too and idk why but staff always give off this insanely fake vibe with weird fabricated personas they sport because they they think this somehow pleases tourists? (Spoiler: IT DOES NOT, everything just feels pretty off and not genuine at all).
 All very exhausting. I’m leaving Vietnam soon and couldn’t be happier to leave this all behind me. 
 Sorry I just had to rant for a moment after countless disappointing experiences.

                              <span>Going on a business trip to Ho Chi Minh in April. Never been to VN and I like food. Been to other parts of Asia but VN has been a goal of mine someday. My plan was to find a market and just go for it. I will literally eat anything at least once. 
 Everything I read on this sub looks delicious. Just any tips on what I should do are appreciated. I’m not just going to eat pho or Bahn Mi. Things with fresh herbs and noodles/soups are interesting to me. I like spice and not American guy spicy. I don’t need to eat meat with everything. 
 I have a weekend to explore. Thanks I appreciate it.

                              <span>I would rather have a perfectly executed com tam dish over a filet mignon. I have dreams about this dish. 
 What is the best way to prepare the pork at home? My mouth is watering actually typing this.

 If anyone here knows what it means please let me know!

                              <span>Hello friends! I created a facebook group for those who are interested in pursuing surrogacy in the US. This is something that is new to Vietnam but many International parents come to the US for surrogacy. 
 I created this page and I hope to post information for any who are interested. I am Vietnamese American so I do not have many connections in Vietnam to share this page with. 
 If you know anyone in Vietnam struggling with fertility, please share this page! 
 I cannot link it for some reason but the group is called “Mang thai hộ tại hoa kỳ”

The first price I was quoted was 6 million and I talked them down to 4.8 million. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m not fine with the price I paid even if it was overpriced I&#x27;m just curious how well I did bargaining and if I got a good price as at the start of my trip I was overpaying like double at minimum for everything and haggling is a brand new concept to me as a Canadian. Please let me know I&#x27;m curious if I got any better!

                              <span>I’ve been to like a dozen of shops in Hanoi checking: - if they provide tax refunds - what their prices are
 I’ve done it so you don’t have to :)
 Turns out every shop has slightly different prices on Apple products.
 ShopDunk has both the lowest prices AND provide tax certificate so you can get your further 10% off at the airport.
 I paid 9.9M VND for an Apple Watch S9. After tax rebate it’s 9M, about 25% cheaper than I’d pay for it in the UK.
 iPhone 15 works out at around £800, so 20% cheaper than in the UK.
 As far as I can tell there shouldn’t be any regional differences in hardware or software, albeit Apple warranty isn’t international as far as I can tell.
