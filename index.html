                              <span>First of all I know this is a long shot, but my Dad used to hoard a bunch of Karaoke DVD&#x27;s, he pasted away in 2016, so I&#x27;m now struggling to find a few songs that bring back a lot of nostalgia. I don&#x27;t remember the lyrics, but I remember the music videos to a certain degree.
 Song #1: This music video in particular showed a feud between two gangs I&#x27;m assuming. I vividly remember a scene where one gang is sitting around a table playing poker, and polishing their guns. I guess shit hit the fan, cause then they pulled up in a limo to the airport, and the other gang got off the airplane, and they just started fighting. LMAO

                              <span>My wife is from Vietnam but has been living in the US for 8 years. Her parents have been living here longer, and no longer have any Vietnamese citizenship papers. The question concerns them.
 Due to circumstances they put their properties in the name of a relative who still lives in Vietnam, but now they wish to change that. Because they no longer have their citizenship papers, and it takes a long time to get them again, they cannot put the properties in their names. What sort of options do they have?
 I was wondering if there was a kind of trust they could use to own the property, but have the trust be controlled by them, or, at the very least, have it be controlled by a relative still in Vietnam, but with their name attached in some way that requires their consent for anything to be done to the property. They are old and probably too trusting, I want to see if there is any way we can help protect their interests as well as possible. They said they already spoke to an attorney, but I am not sure they spoke to the right kind or asked the right questions.
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Mostly curious about Hu Tieu and Bun Mam street food carts. The places that have reusable bowls, not the take out containers.
 I assume every customer just shares the same bowl and chopsticks if the owner cannot wash dishes.

                              <span>I am finally meeting my fiancé in June! I
 want to get married and get him here as soon as possible since I am already 25. I was looking into getting married right away and applying for the cr1 visa but I heard it takes such a long time and I&#x27;m looking to settle down and start a family soon.
 Should I meet him and then apply for the k1 visa??? I wonder if they would even let me apply since I barely meet him for the first time. I am just so confused about what I should do. I know I need to provide so many documents and proof. I&#x27;m in southern California if anyone knows any companies for assistance :(

 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Xin chào mọi người. Mình hiện tại thì vừa tốt nghiệp đại học ngành kế toán và đang làm trong b4. Mình đang ở canada theo diện work permit nên sẽ có 3 năm để làm việc và cũng như cơ hội để kiếm thẻ xanh ở đây. Nhưng mà hiện tại thì em cảm thấy rất muốn về VN để sinh sống và làm việc cũng như được ở gần gia đình và bạn bè hơn. Nên mình dự tính là vẫn sẽ ở canada làm việc 2-3 năm để có thêm kinh nghiệm (và bằng CPA ). Mình chỉ đang thắc mắc là nếu trường hợp mình như vậy thì về vn có ổn không ạ? Và vấn đề lương thì mọi người thấy như thế nào? Mình thật sự rất cần lời khuyên ngay lúc này vì mình cảm thấy rất nhớ Việt Nam. Nếu quyết định về VN thì mình nghĩ lương sẽ không thể nào bằng được như ở CA được, nhưng mình nghĩ mình sẽ thoải mái hơn vì được gần gia đình và bạn bè và cũng như được ăn những món mình thích hoặc buồn thì cứ xách xe lên mà đi 1 vòng thôi. Nhưng nếu lương không ổn thì cũng hơi stress 1 tí. 
 Cho mình cảm ơn mọi người nhiều.
 Hi everyone. I have just graduated from the university majoring in accounting and currently working as an accountant in Big4. I am in Canada on a work permit so I will have 3 years to work as well as the opportunity to apply for a green card. But now, I really feel like going back to Vietnam to live and work so I can be closer to my family and friends. I’m planning to stay in Canada to work for 2-3 years to gain more experience (and getting CPA). Is ok to go back to Vietnam after that? And what about the salary expectation? I really need some advices right now because I miss Vietnam so much. If I do decide to return to Vietnam, I don&#x27;t think the salary will be as good as compared to CA, but I think I will be happier since I can be closer family and friends .
 Thank you and I really appreciate any advices/ suggestions/ inputs.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m currently in Southeast Asia and will be arriving in Vietnam in late April. I originally planned to do the motorbike loop in Ha Giang independently on rented bikes, but that was before I learned about needing a motorcycle license. I don&#x27;t want to risk my insurance being void, so that&#x27;s out of the question now. 
 I was pretty set on doing it independently without a company, so this threw a real wrench in my plan. I&#x27;ve already decided to skip travelling to Northern Thailand because of burning season, so I know I&#x27;ll be back to the area, so my question is whether I should wait until I have a motorcycle license and do it later in life, or just suck it up and do it with an easy rider. 
 The reason I&#x27;m posting is just to hear how it went for other people. I don&#x27;t love not being in control of my own bike, I&#x27;m somewhat introverted so the social aspect isn&#x27;t huge, I like being able to stop and check out little shops or side roads, and I&#x27;m concerned with a bigger group that I won&#x27;t be able to do this. I don&#x27;t really have the money to do a private tour, and even doing it with an easy rider is putting a bit of a stretch on my budget. 
 Overall though, I&#x27;m wondering if I should still just do it. I suppose I&#x27;m just looking for stories of how people felt using easy riders and whether they felt like they would have had a better time doing it solo. The loop was the one thing I wanted to do the most out of Southeast Asia, but I&#x27;m wondering if I should just do it later when I can fully enjoy it. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Static variables and static methods are two important concepts in Java.  Whenever a variable is declared as static, this means there is only one copy of it for the entire class, rather than each instance having its own copy. A static method means it can be called without creating</span>

 As a note: My friends love the zoo / safari which is why we were thinking of phu quoc

 I&#x27;m hoping to hire an artist who can create some sketches and Vietnamese writings in a journal that will be used as a prop in a short film.
 The project will require writing journal entries (in Vietnamese) for a character and producing sketches that would include medical drawings and sketches of plants, animals, and people. I would want to produce somewhere around 6-8 pages in total.
 Here&#x27;s the sort of look I am hoping for: Example journal
 Please send me a DM and we can talk about the project and your rate in more detail! Thank you!
 (Also, please let me know if I should post this request somewhere else instead.)

                              <span>Hello! Looking for some advice - let me know if this isn’t the right place. Friend and I are planning to ride 110cc bikes from north to south, weaving from mountains to coast in April/May. 
 We are fully licensed to ride motorcycles in the US and have been riding for years. Fully understand that riding there is different and we take that seriously. Would be wearing protective gear and staying off the roads that don’t allow bikes. The US IDP provided by AAA lists Vietnam as “not party to the 1949 convention but honors IDP”. This is a little confusing as Vietnam did sign the Geneva convention in 1953. So while we aren’t terribly worried about being allowed to do this, we are having trouble finding medical insurance coverage since there doesn’t appear to be any laws that explicitly say US citizens can rent or drive any type or vehicle there. We’ve read about certain companies that would provide medical coverage anyway as long as you are licensed and qualified in your home country but haven’t found one yet.
 Is anyone aware of a way we can do this? Or any companies that expats or travelers have used successfully recently? I’m not willing to ride without medical coverage so I would need to travel by other means or go somewhere else. This is a trip I’ve been thinking of doing for years - I’d be extremely bummed to have to see this beautiful country out a train window and not be able to experience the smaller mountain communities along the journey (I’d also need to do the trip alone in this case). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Spent 9 days traveling in Vietnam. Started from Hoi An and kept moving to Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, and ended at Ho Chi Minh. Used different modes of transport, met tons of people, and experienced things that I&#x27;m truly grateful for.
 My experiences helped me break a lot of stereotypes and prejudices that were told to me before my visit. Vietnam is not a country for cheap shopping or fake stuff or weird food. it&#x27;s not a country where people will con you or misguide you. It&#x27;s not a country that is rude, indifferent, or selfish.
 After 9 days in Vietnam, I&#x27;m taking back memories of meeting kind locals who go out of their way to help you, friendly shopkeepers who give you a small sovenieur as good luck because you made them smile while bargaining, helpful grab drivers who gave you a genuine smile just because you bowed and offered with money with both hands, Bar tenders and staff, who booked grab for me and offered a free drink just because i was nice to them. At every situation I got stuck or lost, I was given direction by locals who didn&#x27;t have to give a fuck about me. After traveling many places in the world, I sincerely believe that if tourists remove their stereotypical blindfolds, they can experience a truly beautiful country I.e. Vietnam. ❤️ And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m taking back to India with me.
 P.S: I would like to offer my hospitality if anyone is planning to travel to India, especially Mumbai. Over and out.

I have an International Driving Permit from USA through AAA, according to some sites I should be able to use my IDP to exchange for a Vietnamese DL. Is that possible or will they require me to have a TRC? This is for driving a car, not a motorbike.

 I am seeking for some tips and suggestions to explore the North part of the country in 2-3 weeks.
 Please share the places which I must cover/visit during this trip. 
 P.S. I love photography and so please suggest places which has potential for me to get some good memorable pictures.

 I&#x27;m looking for stuff to stop off and do on the way, I&#x27;m an adventures person i like sky diving, scuba diving, para gliding, quad biking, and all that kind lf stuff. 
 I love beaches, exploring, beautiful views, good food and tradition.
 If you guys have visited this beautiful country before and have some suggestions it would be Highley appreciated 😊

 Long Back story: So I met this VN lady on a trip to VN, we expressed romantic interest in each other. I don&#x27;t know the VN language, written or oral, so we just used a translator.

 I know that generally STEM is better than Social subjects, however if you guys would apply to a university in VietNam, which one would you consider? I would like to study Law or Business and I already know some basic Vietnamese as i had experience with the language before and studying it for university wouldn&#x27;t be a problem! 
 Please help me as I am considering VietNam as one of my destionations for pursuing a higher education, Xin Cam On! ;)

                              <span>I&#x27;m set to leave for Vietnam next week. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve just now found out that the internet speeds are supposedly garbage in Vietnam at the moment. How bad is it? Would a VPN help get around any throttling? Are phone network speeds similarly affected? I&#x27;m actually set to be taking online classes, so this is quite concerning for me.

                              <span>Tôi mới xem xong một phim Hàn Quốc lồng tiếng Việt rất hay trên Youtube gọi là &quot;Tranh Đoạt Thừa Kế&quot;. Có ai nào có lời khuyên về phim khác lồng tiếng Việt hay không?
 I just watched an amazing Korean drama on YouTube called Tranh Đoạt Thừa Kế (&quot;Graceful Family&quot; in English) with great Vietnamese dubbing. Does anyone have recommendations on other good shows with good Vietnamese dubbing?

 Where do you buy contact lenses and contact fluid? I&#x27;m in Bin Thanh at the moment but any place that speaks english will do. I don&#x27;t need a check up, just the lenses. I head out tomorrow and hoping to pick up lenses quickly. Looking for a place like Top Charoen Optical in Thailand. Thanks!

 ​
 I&#x27;m looking for a business suit for office use. I&#x27;m tall (1m85) so I will need to have it adjusted because the ready to wear offer in vietnam does not fit well for me (too short)
 ​
 Any suggestion ? For below 3 000 000 VND ?
 ​
 Thank You

                              <span>hello! so the topic for my high school thesis is &#x27;the history of vietnamese fashion&#x27; where i basically explain the development of the fashion of vientam throughout the history. i have one problem though. my sources are very limited because my vietnamese sucks (im very ashamed of it) and i struggle to translate the vietnamese sources. i have &#x27;Ngàn Năm Áo Mũ&#x27; at home but i barely understand anything. i found an english translation to one part which helped me hugely but now i need to translate the rest of the book. does anyone know if theres a translation to the whole book somewhere? or do you know any other sources regarding this topic?

                              <span>tl;dr: trying to find an old family graveyard. I know it’s hopeless, but maybe someone here has some advice lol
 My grandmother’s grandmother is from Huế, my grandmother’s family is from Tra Vinh, where we went to a family graveyard when we went to Vietnam for the first time this summer. We were able to come there since our family still has contact with Hmong people (?) that used to work for the family who own it now. It had the graves of many family members except one, my grandmother’s grandmother: Nguyễn Thị Điệm (born ca. 1880). Although there was a picture of her with her date of death: 20 Aug 1916. My grandmother told me that she was buried in Huế with her family, and that her brother who now lives in the US visited the grave in 2000 via contact with the gravekeepers, although she has not had contact with him for a long time, and does not seem very keen on doing it either. Apparently her brother (my greatuncle) is also not that bright due to his years in the camp.
 The family was apparently very rich, and were according to my family close to the emperor, I know nothing else except that Nguyễn Thị Điệm’s brother was a very prestigious or conceited photographer.
 I know its probably hopeless, but does anyone maybe have any advice on how i should find (how to contact) the graveyard (owners)? Or any other advice?
 Or just drop your personal family stories in the comments:)

                              <span>Hi, I’m currently in Hanoi and am planning to travel to SaPa in the next couple of days for some trekking. I don’t really want book a trekking tour so I was just wondering if anyone has experience with this. Is it possible to trek to some different villages and book home stays for one night on arrival?
 Any other info is appreciated!

                              <span>I have a few opportunities in Vietnam but is trying to navigate the space here - in terms of relationship building and the softer side of people. 
 How does it work typically? I work for an MNC and while I do not want to go into the zone of corruption, I do want to understand the dynamics between seller/customers. 
 Do people typically go KTVs for some &#x27;fun&#x27; or is it usually in normal dinner places or what not? Are gifts expected?

                              <span>As the title says, it&#x27;s really hard to find someone in Vietnam since most of them have the same name and surname.
 So I&#x27;m actually a half Filipino half Vietnamese(dad filipino, mom vietnamese), when I was 7 years old, my mom was ask to go back to Vietnam since she&#x27;s been overstayed here in the Philippines, and promised to comeback after she fix the issue, and in the first few months we still have a communication with her and then suddenly gone, no calls, letter, etc.
 I am now 24 years old, Ive been searching for her for years, I do not wish her to come back to our lives, I just wanted to know how was she&#x27;s been doing. I tried searching her on facebook but no luck, cuz everytime I searched her full name a lot of the accounts has the same or similar names, I even include my middle name which is &quot;Nguyen&quot; in my facebook so its easier for her to find me.
 And I&#x27;m not even sure if this is right sub to post this, and sorry if my writing is scuffed, and also my english😅😅

                              <span>A long time ago I had a Vietnamese student who would say something anytime he would get a wrong answer or anytime he was frustrated. When I asked him about he said it was like a bad word. 
 It was a single word with a long s at the end.... Like &quot;hasssss&quot; or &quot;hesssss&quot;
 Would really like to know what the word actually was, hopefully he wasn&#x27;t calling me a dickhead! Haha

 For comparison Thailand, with 33% fewer local population, has about 3.5m expats

 I ordered some stickers on Etsy for the first time, and after two months it hasn&#x27;t shown up. May I ask have anyone buy and receive orders Etsy from Việt Vietnam before?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be traveling for 4 months around South East Asia and am looking to buy medical insurance.
 All the providers I&#x27;ve seen (including reputable ones like TrueTraveller or World Nomads) say it on their fine print that they only cover medical treatment in state-run hospitals.
 I am looking for a provider that would foot the bill from a private hospital.
 Does anyone know of any providers?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I plan to travel to Da Nang via Ho Chi Minh City. The plane ticket that I am looking at has 1 hour 50 minutes layover in HCMC Airport. The airport&#x27;s domestic terminal doesn&#x27;t seem so far away from the international terminal. But being a foreigner, I need to go though the customs and immigrations, which I heard could take approximately an hour.
 Would I have enough time to catch the connecting flight to Da Nang or should I get another ticket that has a 3 hour layover?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am Vietnamese girl dating an expat for the 1st time, plz give me some advices. I live in Hanoi, he lives in HCM so this is the first time dating. He asks me to show him around when we meet in Hanoi. I was kinda passive in the relationships with other Vietnamese boyfriends before, like they picked me up to dating locations. Thus, I don’t know how to take the lead in dating with an expat in Hanoi. Which type of transportation used when we date? I don’t have car driving license. Pick him up by a motorbike I drive is bit weird, isn’t it? Have you been in this situation? Plz share your experience. Kindly introduce me some places that expats want to hangout in Hanoi. We are both in twenties. Much appreciated!
 Edit: Thank so much for your advice. Most of them are very helpful. I am way too overthinking. I was worried about the size difference if I drive him on a bike, im like 5’1 feet while he is 6’2 feet. But, I will ask him what he wants to choose bike or cab although bike is the my most preferred transport when hanging out in Hanoi. To whom who may wish me luck with green card: he is not even a Western. He is my Hindu colleague. We hit it off and accept a long distance relationship. That’s it. Now Vietnamese girls don’t date expats for money. We can be both cute and rich at the same time. Get used to it.

                              <span>I’ve arrived in Hanoi and there’s a big event with lots of people playing drums on a big stage and lots of people waving flags too. Any ideas what all this is in aid of?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am visiting Vietnam in July this year for a close friend&#x27;s wedding. Just wondering what Vietnamese people typically give their friends and loved ones as a wedding gift? I&#x27;ve actually never been to any wedding as an adult so I&#x27;m a bit lost and gifting in a completely different culture makes it feel even more daunting. I would love to hear some examples of what you would typically choose as a wedding gift.
 Also - Other foreign friends who are going have said they are just going to give the couple money, is this normal/acceptable in Vietnam? And if so, how much should one typically give?
 Appreciate any insights, cheers

                              <span>Hello! First time in Vietnam and enjoying the sights. Staying in Ho Chi Minh city amd curious if there are any good venues for live music, funk, or whiskey bar style settings. Recommendations welcome! Staying at the Au Lac Charmer hotel. 
 Also - what is the deal with the small bars that have multiple women out front? It’s not red light district, is it more to entice to enter the bars? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Me and girlfriend are currently in Saigon and we are obviously considering visiting the Cu Chi tunnels the day after tomorrow. However I&#x27;m not really sure whether it&#x27;s worth it or not, because of the relatively long drive there. 
 I&#x27;m very interested in the Vietnam war and already know plenty about it, so visiting something like this seem like a natural choice but at the same time I hate things that are too touristy and this seem exactly that. People posing for dumb pictures, like thousands of others before them, standing on destroyed tanks or in entrances to one of the tunnels.
 Would you recommend it?

 Because i came across something on youtube that looks like targetting views/clicks from indians. The contents looks like from Vietnam hence i posted here. Sorry if this is not the right place for this.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am planning on traveling in Northern Vietnam this month. The air quality apps show really high PM 10 and PM 2.5 numbers, meaning the air is hazardous for health.
 I was wondering - is this casual for that side of the country or is it because of the burning season, similarly to Northern Thailand?
 Maybe anyone currently travelling there could share there experiences?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hey Community,
 I&#x27;m in Da Nang for the next 7 weeks and love it so far. But still did not meet any local women, which I obviously wouldn&#x27;t mind. I would like to go out tomorrow night, I don&#x27;t mind going solo. And then, I am usually not afraid to talk with a women if there seems to be an &#x27;&#x27;opening&#x27;&#x27;. I value a good friendship, and nice communication / talk, even if nothings happens afterwards. It&#x27;s really mostly about meeting local people/women and &#x27;&#x27;why not if more&#x27;&#x27;.
 What would be the best nightclubs to easily meet local people who are more likely to be &#x27;&#x27;into foreigners&#x27;&#x27; (I am in my thirties, very healthy and tall, I think I can be doing ok) and more likely to be able to talk a bit or good English ? Avoiding places full of &#x27;&#x27;pro&#x27;s&#x27;&#x27; and full of Koreans could be a good thing I imagine :D (but I imagine it&#x27;s not always avoidable).
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>So there&#x27;s this rap song that I came across, I &#x27;m just curious what it means since apparently it&#x27;s vulgar? Google translate made it kind of a jumbled mess. If I need to add a NSFW tag, please let me know. Here are the lyrics:
 Mình ở đâu đấy?
 Lạc vào trong xứ sở dâu tây
 Phía đằng xa,
 Giữa bãi cỏ hai người nằm ra
 Chú cuội ngủ cùng chị Hằng Nga
 Nick Vujicic dùng đầu đập cửa
 Gọi cô bé cầm nhầm bật lửa
 Bác xuân diệu vô cùng vội vàng
 Gọi cô tấm đi dự hội làng
 Bảy cô lùn đi cùng ông tuyết
 nếu bị lạc liên hệ tổng đài 1900-00-không-biết
 anh thánh gióng miệng nhiều vết bẩn
 ăn bánh quy, kẹo chip chip, sữa chua nếp cẩm
 aladin gạ gẫm mỵ nương bàn kế hoạch hóa
 sơn tinh ném bàn ghế gạch đá
 scooby dooby doo lại phải dắt sơn tinh đi tù
 giơ khẩu súng nặn bằng đất sét
 cả ngôi làng đều chạy mất dép
 scooby dooby doo lại phải dắt sơn tinh đi tù
 thủy tinh mang theo cốc trà chanh
 làng vắng tanh như chùa bà đanh
 ran mori sử dụng tán thủ
 các võ sư không ai dám thử
 nên nàng đưa conan về nhà cả hai phá án ở nhà thám tử
 một giấc mơ suýt thì hoàn chỉnh
 có giọng nói làm mình choàng tỉnh
 xanh, đỏ, tím, vàng 
 any help is appreciated, sorry for possibly sounding stupid.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 We are going to Vietnam for 2 weeks late March with my wife (28 and 25 year old): 5 days in HCM, 3days in Phu Quoc and 5days in Hanoï.
 ​
 In Hanoï we are thinking going there:
  
Hanoi Train Streets
 Ha Long Bay : do you recommend 2days/1night or 3days/2nights?
 Vietnam Military History Museum
 Hoàn Kiếm Lake
 Don Xuan market
 French quarter
  
​
 HCM:
  
Ben Thanh market
 An Dong market
 War remnants Museum
 Vincom Center
 Nam Cat Tien park
 Nguyen Hue walk
 Mekong Delta
  
​
 Do you have any recommendations or advices? 
 Also, I am a bit clueless on the best transportation to go to Ha Long Bay or Mekong Delta. In the city, I planned to use Grab or Go-jek.
 ​
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to travel to HCMC early May, and from what I&#x27;ve read, the weather is to be humid and HOT!! 
 Since I&#x27;ll be visiting several factories in the region, traveling by cars, would it be considered inappropriate or disrespectful if I wear shorts? 
 Any suggestions are welcome!! Thank you in advance!!

                              <span>I’ll be in Vietnam for a month soon with another month in Thailand before i return to Vietnam for another few weeks. I live in Europe and I’m not sure how mobile networks work outside European Union. I’m looking for a good few GBs of data 20-30GB allowance with a few national calls for hostels and local calls. Do Vietnamese providers offer roaming in neighbouring countries like you’d get in Europe? What are the prices like and what are my options? All help appreciated.
 I actually work for a big provider in my home country where it’s unlimited national data + 19GB anywhere in the EU for €20 . I’d love to find something similar if possible.

                              <span>I am not from there, but curious if it makes sense as a retirement plan for us. Cheaper cost of living? Visa issues? Recommandations on what parts of the country would make sense? Buying home? Medical issues? I&#x27;ve been there many times but considering long term life as a retired person. Anyone here do it?

                              <span>Two years ago I was constantly seeing stories about how Vietnam had the highest economic growth in Southeast Asia. Was getting massively invested in by Japan and Korea, and had tons of companies relocating to it from China during the Sino-American trade war. Many YouTubers I was watch on the ground said they could see the explosive growth year by year as it felt like the early days of China as it was beginning to achieve great economic success. The everyday life was becoming tangibly better year by year.
 But I checked in again recently, and I saw the GDP growth has massively faltered the past two years, and also saw that the previous economics minded president has seemingly been replaced by a more politics minded one.
 So I was just wondering, does Vietnam still seem to be on track for explosive growth and this is just a short break because of COVID or is the growth really slowing down? Is life still improving year by year in Vietnam to a noticable degree?

                              <span>Hi, I am on Phu Quoc right now and I see it again. Huuuuge luxury hotels, but nearly completely empty. When I look the price up its 5M Dong a night. 5M Dong. 
 How do these luxury hotels even survive? Why they don’t lower the price?
 It seems like the hotel owners are so crazy rich they don’t care about some losses and don’t want to lower the prices to not lose image or something. (imagine you pay $200 for a hotel and some months later it’s $100 a night because of low demand. in Europe or also in Thailand, hotels dgaf and just lower the price to get at least some customers, but here it’s not like that). Or?? I can’t understand it pls explain me guys
 Also this Vin Grand World has sooo many restaurants and stuff with expensive food, but most of them are completely empty because it’s too expensive when you could get outside the same food for much lower price. 
 It seems like the “market” with demand offer etc doesn’t really work for these giants they just dgaf about losses, or is there some bigger story behind that? I also remember how people in this sub once talked how expensive vinfast cars became or smth like that

                              <span>Sorry if this has been asked before. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if a large number of people in Vietnam want to immigrate to other countries(specifically the West) or if this is government propaganda in the West trying to put down other countries to make themselves look better by comparison. 
 Thanks for your help in advance!

While no doubt it&#x27;s down to the unfortunate circumstances, the last couple of places I stayed in 2022 were nothing like the photos/reviews, were damaged and run down.
 Bringing the family along in 2023 and would like to know your recommendations for a nice place to stay.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I visited Hanoi for a few weeks and went to some clubs too. In most clubs the sold balloons and I was told they contain laughing gas. Saw some people getting really high on it and kinda knocked out sometimes.
 Friend handed me (already very drunk) one and I tried it several times excessively but had no reaction.
 First, I don&#x27;t know if laughing gas is illegal. Some clubs were really suspicious and you had to talk to some guy around a corner to get through some secret gate. Somehow you couldn&#x27;t here any of the loud music outside.
 And second could we get scammed? Is selling fake gas a thing? I&#x27;m not a fan and won&#x27;t do it ever again, but I&#x27;m really interested in understanding what happened there.

                              <span>Hi Everyone, Yeah it&#x27;s another Vietnam itinerary.
 I&#x27;m traveling with my wife from India to spend around 2 weeks in this country on our anniversary. Need help in making an itinerary that has a balance of both a little fast and relaxed overall.
 But I&#x27;m too confused to jot down the itinerary completely, mainly in the number of days to spend in a city. Some parts are fixed though.
 Fixed (15 days): 14th April &#x27;23 to 28th April &#x27;23,
 Flights Booked and stay booked for Phu Quoc
 14th arrival (Ho Chi Minh) Going to Phu Quoc directly
 14th to 16th (Phu Quoc)
 28th departure (Hanoi)
 I want to cover the country from south to central to the north, with the 19th being preferred not traveling as it&#x27;s our anniversary that day.
 Uncertain (16th to 28th):
 No Stay or Travel option booked
 16th to 18th: Ho Chi Minh Stay
 18th to 19th: Nha Trang, can this be skipped? as it&#x27;ll make us travel on the 19th to Hoi An/Da nang
 19th to 21st: Hoi An, Da nang, and Ba Na Hills (Unable to select dates to stay where on which date, maximizing things to do in each place)
 22nd to 28th: Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Sa pa
 We want to cover Ninh Binh and Phong Nha National Park as well but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible as this above draft itself feels a little rushed. We are already removed Dalat and Hue from our itinerary for the same reason, doesn&#x27;t want it to be too fast-paced.
 Now I want help with what place we can omit if this itinerary looks too rushed or not possible.
 Any other suggestion for a newbie in Vietnam please do suggest!

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 Has anyone ever heard of a store in Saigon called Kallos? It’s located in D10 and they have items I want to get for myself and others, however I cannot find anyone (so far) who has either heard of them or shopped there. 
 They’re an outlet (similar to Vincom) and have excellent professional reviews and items, nice FB page, reviews and it’s run by a Korean man who opened up his own shop. But it would be very reassuring to know if someone has actually shopped here before. 
 If either anyone here, or you have someone who has shopped here before, please let me know and the most important let me know if the products you bought were authentic or fake because this is what I’m worried about more than anything. I attach an image of the address and business as well. Kallos Vietnam

                              <span>Picked up some Valium (Diazepam) from a chemist in the Hanoi old quarter; a couple streets away from the beer street; wasn’t a big pharmacy but he said do we want anything for sleeping or travel. Now while I saw him grab them out of the Zepam 10 packet they are obviously sealed still. They don’t have the MS engraved in them just a cross on one side most of the pictures online look to have an MS as well. What do we think?

 Anh cùng đang cô gắng tự học Tiếng Việt rồi nếu mọi người ơi thể recommend những có gì anh có thể bài tạp. I would be quite grateful.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a driver&#x27;s license in Germany for cars only and I have a Vietnamese passport but my residence is in Germany.
 I would like to bring an international Driver&#x27;s license back to Vietnam to ride a motorbike legally. I know I just need to do a practical test.
 My question is: will my licence have a short expiry date like foreigners who stay in Vietnam for a limited time? Or will the license expiration date be the same as my driver&#x27;s licence in Germany because I have Vietnamese citizenship? I have no residence in Vietnam.
 My plan is to use the license again for multiple visits. It will take time for the license to be issued, so I can&#x27;t afford the time to get the license every time I visit Vietnam.
 (Yes, I know I can drive illegally and bribe officers, but I want my health and liability insurance to pay for higher damages if I ever get into a serious accident)

                              <span>Là một người Hàn Quốc, tôi cảm thấy xấu hổ về sự cố này. Chúng tôi rất tiếc về những điều khủng khiếp đã xảy ra trong Chiến tranh Việt Nam.
 Tôi sẽ đánh giá cao nếu bạn có thể hiểu rằng dư luận Hàn Quốc phần lớn cũng đang chỉ trích Bộ trưởng. Dù vậy chính phủ hiện nay đang bị chỉ trích rất nhiều nhưng không ngờ Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng lại làm như vậy... Go Vietnam
 As a Korean, I feel embarrassed about this incident. I regret the terrible things that happened during the Vietnam War.
 I would appreciate it if you could understand that Korean public opinion is largely criticizing the Minister as well. Although the current government is being criticized a lot, it is unexpected that the Defense Minister would do such a thing... Go Vietnam

                              <span>I dropped my phone resulting in my screen breaking. This phone is a Huawei p30. I will be in Vietnam for another two weeks and then onto Cambodia so need a solution. 
 Does anyone know if this can be cheaply fixed in Vietnam. I am aware lcd screens can be costly. We are going to Nha Trang next, then Ho Ch Minh and Phu Quoc.
 Should I just buy a new/second hand phone? If so, any recommendations where I could buy one from. Thanks!

 Car company: Tan Kim Chi booked through VeXeRe.
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>I’ll be spending two weeks across Vietnam in March and would like to visit places where I can learn about the history of your country. I understand that there are plenty of museums in Hanoi and Saigon, but I’m curious to hear about other historically significant locations that can be visited and learned from as a tourist. 
 Large graves, temples, war zones, etc.. are of interest, if possible.

                              <span>I lived in Hanoi from 2005 to 2007 (Vietnamese second gen, went back with my parents so I could learn the language and culture) and then visited during the summers until around 2010. I really want to go back at some point and I’m curious as to how much Hanoi has changed. Some things I remember:
 Roads were like 90% motorcycles, 7% cars, and 3% bikes
 Sông tô lịch was literally just an open sewer (please tell me this has gotten better lmao)
 No one wore seatbelts, and while I was there when people began being required to wear helmets, a lot of people wouldn’t buckle them
 Cutting in line was very common 
 Crosswalks weren’t a thing, you just walked across the street and people swerved around you
 Has any of this changed?

 Just about to visit Vung Tau for a day and wanted to know of any top good hook ups or best things to do.
 Of course I&#x27;ve had a look online but wanted to see if anyone has some hidden gems!

 I am in the process of getting teacher work visa in Vietnam but my employer asked me to &quot;legalise&quot; a bunch of documents like my passport, diploma, ect. I&#x27;ve never heard this term and struggling to find out how to do it. Can anyone help me or share experiences?

 Can someone link me an OFFICIAL page of Viettel where I can see the prices for tourist data SIM cards? I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.
 Thanks a lot.

 First post here because I am panicking. I am travelling to Vietnam TOMORROW. I have no travel/health insurance. Some websites still list it as a requirement. Is it actually ?!! It is not written on my country’s embassy’s website. 
 Please help clarify this for me. I am so stressed and scared that I can’t travel .

 Era was recommended by my hotel but I had low expectations. I&#x27;m happy to say that the food and service were magnificent. 
 Duan and his wife are foodies and it shows in the taste and presentation of the good eats they serve at their restaurant. After a short chat I learned that Duan is self-taught cook and that he and his wife love to experiment with recipes. His methodology puts me in mind of a food scientist. 
 I left very full. Very happy. And, very satisfied. I finally had a meal that was worth all the hype.

                              <span>Thao and the staff on the boat for the Halong Bay Tour were phenomenal. 
 I was on a tour with another company when I realized the return time to Halong Bay City would make me late for a transfer to Hanoi. I was assured at booking that there would not be a conflict but that was not the case. 
 I saw Thao&#x27;s boat departing (a completely different company) and asked if I could hitch a ride back to the city with them. Both the captain and Thao, the tour guide, agreed to let me come along. 
 But, it gets better. Thao called my hotel so I could grant permission for the transfer driver to pick-up my luggage. 
 He also called the transport company to arrange an alternate pick-up location and changed my pick up time. Then Thao had one of his wait staff to rush me to the new pick-up location on the back of her scooter. Thanks to them I made it to Hanoi and now sit comfortably in my hotel room. 
 Thao refused a tip and I paid a nominal fee to the captain and the waitress/motorbike driver. In fact, the waitress returned half of the very small fee I paid her and refused when I insisted she keep all of it. 
 I&#x27;m so grateful to Thao and the staff for helping a complete stranger. They truly went above and beyond earning them the LifeSaver award. Many thanks to them all.

 This was my experience. Punctual transport from my hotel to the pier. 
 Great communication via Airbnb although start times displayed on the site when booking are incorrect. I confirmed that if I took the 11:30am tour that I would be back in time for 5:30pm pick up for my private transfer to Hanoi. I was assured that I would not miss pick-up. 
 My group was escorted by a coordinator inside and instructed to sit down where we were abandoned for approximately 40 minutes. One couple left because we did not know who we were waiting for, if anyone would return, or where we were going. 
 The coordinator returns, hands out tickets and then led us to the …</span>

                              <span>I love living in Vietnam 🇻🇳 ❤️ but the thing that kills me is the unnecessarily LOUD TRUCK HORNS. My ears hurt and it startles me (sometimes to the point of crashing) every time one of them decides to blare their cargo ship horn near me. I get alerts on my Apple Watch all the time about how the noise level could cause hearing loss. Oh and the way they drive is insane too! This happens all the time: a big ol 🚛 barreling down the road in the lane traveling the opposite direction from me ENTERS INTO MY LANE, and almost literally RUNS ME OFF THE ROAD. Keep in mind, as a guy driving a motorbike, I’m already in the habit of riding on the very edge of the road, but in the interest of safety, I’ve had to go off the road so many times because some impatient cargo truck driver can’t stand to behind another car so they invade a lane of oncoming traffic whenever they feel like it.
 Back to the horn problem…it has caused numerous deaths. It’s so loud that it had caused people to be startled to the point of falling off their motorbike and getting hit by the semi trucks or getting into deadly accidents with other vehicles from loss of control. It happens too much, and although there is technically a law against it but the penalty (like 2-3tr vnđ) is so light compared to the damage it causes.

                              <span>Hi all, I’m a Vietnamese American who does dragon boat over in the US. I was curious about teams over in Vietnam since I haven’t really seen any Vietnamese appearances at international competitions online. If anyone could point me to the existence of a national team or just any team in Vietnam so that I can keep up on social media, that’d be much appreciated!

                              <span>I have a package from Hong Kong. They are upgraded parts for a small machine.
 I bought them from a store in China, it costs about 365 dollars. The store decided to deliver my package by Fedex (Air way).
 It was shipped quickly from HongKong to Ho Chi Minh for about 3 days, but then it got stuck at a clearance process for over a week. Now I have no clue what I need to do next since Fedex Vietnam keeps asking me to wait.
 For those having the same experiences, is that your typical durations for an import custom process to Vietnam? This is a first time I buy a product from foreign countries so I am little shock.

 Iced milk coffee
 According to the culinary website Taste Atlas, Vietnam&#x27;s iced coffee ranks second among the top 10 best coffees in the world.
 Taste Atlas describes, Vietnamese iced coffee is a combination of dark black coffee with condensed milk and ice.
 Traditionally, iced milk coffee must be made from medium or coarsely ground Vietnamese coffee, typically Robusta.
 The way to make Vietnamese coffee is also unique, unlike anywhere else in the world when pouring hot water through a small filter to let each drop of concentrated coffee flow into the cup, then it will be mixed with condensed milk and added ice.
 Please enjoy once if you have the opportunity to visit Vietnam.

                              <span>Hello, I am currently traveling with my girlfriend in Vietnam and we have some questions about the phone service. In Saigon we bought a SIM for 200,000d. Even though he only half understood us, we were pretty sure he meant we have 4gb per day for 30days. (is this Even a possible price?) After 5 days the internet stopped working. I had internet again the next day and got a message in the evening the 1gb/day was used up. You get but on dozens of other messages that tell something about tariffs but translated only make half sense. Can I ignore them? (I know this from South America where you were often spammed with fake stuff). And do you know which messages you can take seriously?
 Also, how does the charging work? I have seen that there is a short code *101#. In general, I am a bit clueless and would need someone to explain the whole thing to me. Thanks in advance!
 Viettel btw

                              <span>In South Korea, some schools have optional/mandatory Hanja (han characters) classes, it&#x27;s used for stylistic reasons, abbreviation, clarity, etc.
 Koreans also know their Hanja names for official documents, do Vietnamese people know theirs?
 Does Vietnam use han characters like South Korea or less so?

Does anyone know if I can bypass the limit and how? My esim does NOT come with a vietnamese phone number so I can&#x27;t create a new account.

                              <span>Vietnam is the 36th)-largest in the world as measured by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and 26th)-largest in the world as measured by purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2022. But the GDP per capita is still low, ranking at 117th_per_capita) and they are still dependent on foreign ODA. So when do you think they can reach the same level as other SEA countries Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia?

 Quick question again, basically I have very specific hair needs since I have nice, natural curly hair. There is a specific moisture cream that makes my curls extremely luxurious that I really cannot do without now. Because otherwise my hair will be very dry and frizzy and coarse. 
 My question, would my package either be seized or held up with customs when shipping the product? Mind you, I will not be shipping any electronics or perishables (food) or anything like this ever, I would only ever need to order skin/hair care from South Korea to Vietnam. The shop I order from is KoreaDepart, they ship everywhere, however my question is not with them it’s about can I get the products into Vietnam without being seized or held up and having to pay out the ass in fees. 
 The product…</span>

                              <span>Best way to get from Hoi an to Hue? 
 Would you suggest doing a motorbike tour from Hoi An to Hue? Are there enough things to see or better to just take a taxi/bus?
 ​
 Thanks - only have 2 days in Hoi An, and 2 days in Hue.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking if its possible to do overnight jungle trekking in Vietnam, relatively rural. I was in Indonesia last summer and am heading to Vietnam this summer and am looking for more jungle trekking, maybe 2 nights 3 days. 
 Where in Vietnam has the best rainforest? I&#x27;m really interested in seeing the most amazing wildlife possible - in Indonesia for instance I saw Orangutans. 
 Does Vietnam or Cambodia have better wildlife rainforests?

                              <span>I see posts a lot where it is usually a foreigner marrying a girl from VN. However, does anyone have experience with marrying a man from VN as a foreigner?
 I&#x27;m not really a foreigner either, I&#x27;m a VK but don&#x27;t speak vietnamese at all, but I do speak a chinese dialect and was able to get around a little in VN when I was there for 1 month. During that time, I met someone that is too perfect. We aren&#x27;t dating, just friends, we met accidently. His family runs a little food shop/stand and I couldn&#x27;t speak Vietnamese so he stepped in to help and we just started talking since I was there during slow business time.
 Prior to that I also thought about moving to VN to stay closer to family. I also like VN but I feel like I am romanticizing it too much and the reason I like it is because I can escape from my problems (work burnout).
 ​
 I don&#x27;t really know what I really want to ask. I just want to hear from people about their experience. Since men and women in VN can be different in a relationship because of culture. I don&#x27;t want to start a relationship and get his hopes up since he is older than me with aging parents.

And he also threatened to post photos of My passport pages with personal info on facebook and so on. And he threatened to contact immigration to try to block any future visits to vietnam. Should I report that scumbag to the authorities?

                              <span>Hello Everyone!
 Does anyone know how to get your social security insurance contributions or a law firm that could help? 
 I am moving back to the states and was told by my HR Rep that the government can only give me a plaque/certificate with the years worked, not MONEY
 I am owed a decent amount of money and the government has refused to pay, I heard this was also a problem in china but know of friends getting their money there.

                              <span>I remember being very interested in Vietnam&#x27;s Tay Son period ever since I was as young as 7, and I remember always feeling extremely unwell hearing about all these Tay Son bloodlines and everything, including famous generals like Bùi Thị Xuân and her daughter getting stomped to death by elephants. Or the ensuing executions of Nguyễn Nhạc&#x27;s children by having them sawed in half. Despite it being years later, I still feel sad reading about the infamous Nguyen Lord and later Gia Long&#x27;s rampage against Quang Trung&#x27;s monarch. But then It is also my responsibility to be aware that part of his bloodlust was also due to the fact that he had witnessed the killings against his own family when the Tay Son swept down South.
 Humans are scary.
 If anyone else has any insight or corrections which I know will be inevitably pointed out, I would totally love to hear them and see what else I needed to learn about this event.

                              <span>I’m going to Vietnam next month, going from Ho Chi Minh, through central Vietnam and ending in Hanoi. 
 I don’t eat pork or shellfish , and would prefer not to eat any other meat such as chicken or beef. 
 How easy will it be to find options that are ‘chay’ when I am out exploring? How easy will it be to avoid fish sauce, which I know contains shrimp, for example? 
 Is there anything I could buy in a supermarket that is vegetarian that I could quickly grab and go, if I’m in a hurry ?
 Many thanks! 😊

 Of course staying cautious, being aware of surroundings, are basic wonderful tips. 
 But what are some ADVANCED tips that you would recommend? 
 One tip i have received, is buying an AirTag, and putting it on personal belongings. This is great way of utilizing technology we have in 2023.

                              <span>I have been looking into getting a loan in Vietnam as a foreigner for a property purchase. 
 Did not have much luck with banks. Most do not offer loans for foreigners, or people living outside of HN or SG. Vietnam Russia Bank (VRB) seemed to be the easiest for foreigners. 
 I then found Homebase and it seemed too perfect. But the more I read about them in both English and Vietnamese media, the more they seem legit. Though it&#x27;s hard to find much reviews from customers that aren&#x27;t their own promotional material.
 Does anyone know of any experiences with them? Interested hearing both Vietnamese and foreigner experiences.
 If not familiar, they work like: they initially buy the property and own it, then you buy it back from them at a pre-agreed upon price (at any time). You&#x27;re allowed use the property while buying back.

                              <span>I was flying to Tokyo and i got to the check in counter only to be told i needed 3 doses instead of 2. I was directed to the office but a guy stepped up yo me and offered to get me a pcr test to let me fly for $200. In a panic, i agreed and he did some stuff and got me the test, but the gate was closed. So basically i had to buy a flight ticket to Osaka for a little bit later ($455) because i was told i couldn’t get any refund or transfer for the ticket i had + my visa for Vietnam was over today. I then had to pay the guy 4 mil for the pcr and sprinted to make my flight. In addition, new flight from Osaka Just ran into another guy in Osaka who was at the airport and he said the fake pcr was not only 150 but i could have just paid 1 mil to have my ticket changed until i could get a real pcr test for cheap. I feel like an idiot although i know i was just panicked and wanted nothing more than to make it to Tokyo so I’m out $700 extra dollars.

                              <span>Recently, I have been reading about the Doi Moi policy, which the Communist Party or Vietnam (CPV) implemented in 1986. 
 A lot of articles and videos I found on the Internet tend to praise the policy for transforming Vietnam into a rising economy in the ASEAN region, surpassing my country (the Philippines) and others in terms of economic growth and development. 
 I even watched a video from Bloomberg about how North Korea once planned of adopting Vietnam-style reforms to open and grow its economy before the COVID-19 pandemic.
 So I want to know what this sub thinks of Doi Moi. Should other developing countries like the Philippines and North Korea follow Vietnam&#x27;s example? Was it effective in bringing prosperity to Vietnam?

                              <span>I’m curious, has anyone ever been to “Tuyết Thành” - outside of Saigon? What’s it like? How hard is it to get to from Saigon?
 “Tuyết Thành, or &quot;Snowy Citadel&quot; in English, is a city located just 35 kilometers outside of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite being situated in a tropical region, Tuyết Thành is renowned for its year-round snowfall, which is a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for years.”
 “The snow in Tuyết Thành is a stunning sight to behold, falling softly from the sky to create a winter wonderland that is both surreal and magical. The snow is powdery and light, making it perfect for building snowmen or engaging in snowball fights. The cause of this phenomenon remains a mystery, but locals speculate that it&#x27;s due to a unique combination of climatic and geographic factors. Nonetheless, Tuyết Thành is a popular destination for tourists seeking an extraordinary winter experience in Vietnam.”

I&#x27;m moving into a house for the first time and have to get my own internet. I&#x27;ve noticed that my banking app has options to pay for Internet and the options are FPT and Viettel. Considering the recent state of the internet in my current apartment (undersea cable blah blah and all), I thought I&#x27;d ask which of these are the best option.

                              <span>So I recently made a post about shipping an open-box ps4 to my cuz in HCMC using an independent Viet shipper here, and it got held up at customs. That’s what the shipper told me anyway. 
 I’ve decided to ship her a brand new console in the box and everything. What shipping should I use to ensure that she’ll get it? I have UPS, FedEx, DHL, regular postal service. 
 Any tips on filling out customs paperwork and stuff to make sure it gets through? 
 If you’re wondering why I’m not giving her the money to just buy one, I got this ps5 as a gift for free so I can’t justify shelling out $500-600.
 Edit: extra words

                              <span>Hey All, I saw someone posting about shipping VR here but im debating to just buy local.
 Anyone into it? Im new to it however i have some cash to blow on a good setup.
 Anyone buy locally or suggest any good shops? Id rather not piece ship it internationally and if i dont have to rather not buy when i head to US and put it on the plane. 
 I debated steams full setup and a new PC to run it. I am really going to focus on a realistic driver setup(minus the moving hydrolic chair stuff) and flight simulator to learn how to fly.
 Hanoi is ok to but prefer Saigon.
 Open to people commenting on setups also if they have experience since im a noob to it all

                              <span>Hi Saigon Redditors, 
 Any budget hotel you can recommend within D1? I am looking thru Booking right now but open to hear about personal reccomendations based on stay experience. I kinda need to move out of my rented place tomorrow. If you want the story I will oblige, but really need to find and book a place tonight. 
 I just need a name that is it.
 Cam on!

 I am traveling to Vietnam next month from Australia. I am trying to figure out what kind of travel adapter I need but not having much luck. Was hoping someone on this thread might be able to point me in the right direction. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I need to order a few unique accessories for a VR headset from abroad, and I&#x27;ve never in my life used websites like amazon/ubuy/etc. 
 I&#x27;m not familiar with shipping to Vietnam and wanted to get some insights here from the people who have experience with this.
 Which service would you recommend (Amazon, etc.)? Would it be 100% reliable? What obstacles might exist there? And is it as easy as simply ordering on the website and waiting for delivery, or would I need to personally contact customs to pay any extra fees? 
 I live in Central Vietnam so it would not be possible for me to go to Hanoi or HCMC to deal with customs.

                              <span>What’s the price of a decent laptop in Vietnam? I live in the UK and was going to buy one roughly around £650 (~18.5 million vnd), will use it for school work and also some gaming. Would it be cheaper for me just to wait until I move there and then buying one there? Sorry, I am not aware of the prices of things like this in Vietnam, thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I came to the US in 2005 with a passport that was issued in 2003 (expired in 2008). I am currently a permanent resident. My boss is asking me if I want to go overseas for a couple months for business trips in April. However, I do not know if I can even renew my original passport or can I just get a new one? I am near DC so I can just drive there for passport service instead of mailing documents in.

                              <span>I am in my last 6 months of schooling and want to take my CELTA certification to come teach in Vietnam. I was really set on Hanoi, but from what I have been reading it is apparently not a very walkable city. Here in the US, I do not own a car and very rarely drive. I have taken public transportation my whole life and really prefer that to owning/paying for a car.
 I am a bit freaked out by the idea of renting a scooter given how hectic the roads are, but I will do it if that&#x27;s what it takes to come live in Vietnam. But I was wanting to ask how feasible is it to walk and use public transport in Hanoi, or if there is a better city that is suited for this that is not HCMC? What about places outside major cities? Thanks for your help

                              <span>Hello everyone, Maybe the Redditors here can help me out. I&#x27;m trying to look for insurance companies in Vietnam that provides coverage for COVID-19 for tourists. I&#x27;m NOT looking for insurance coverage for an Expat staying long term. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, a minimum coverage of at least $10,000 is a requirement for entry. Any and all suggestions welcome. Thank you.

 Has anyone run into Facebook not paying you when you are traveling around to different countries like Vietnam? Is there anything you can do?

                              <span>I have a co-worker that picked me up because of snow and ice on the roads. I have worked with him for around 8 years and respect him so much because he has taught me a lot at our job. I want to buy him something for the kind gesture of picking me up to show him my thanks that wouldn&#x27;t be included in a &quot;gas money&quot; 10 dollar bill. Gas money seems to impersonal to me.
 He is in his 50&#x27;s. Married with a kid. What could I get him that would show my gratitude while also my respect for his culture? I appreciate him being him and want to be respectful.
 Any help is much appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>Fiancé and I are in the Philippines currently but we’ve been wanting to check out Vietnam, stay there for a week or two. Somewhere with nice beaches.
 Is Phu Cuoc overcrowded now? What about Mui Ne?
 Safe for foreigners? Any kidnappings / crazy shit? Are the Russian tourists causing any problems?
 How easy is it renting a car? Or what’s the best way of getting around?

                              <span>Im new to Reddit so not sure how to post text with pictures. After posting this incidents in some FB groups, people shared their similar experiences so it happens quite a lot. I have never thought someone dares to steal in this area where there are so many security cameras
 Summary: - Before going through security screening, I took off my watch, put it in my purse. My purse didn&#x27;t have zipper or lock. Put my purse lying down next to my husband&#x27;s bag, in the same tray. (XRAY MACHINE IMAGE confirmed there was watch in my purse) - My husband push the bag tray in Xray machine then went through body scan. Then another man jumped in while I was taking off my shoes. I let him since I didn&#x27;t want to delay other people - I went through body scan after pushing the shoe tray in Xray - Right after that, I got my purse back from my husband at the conveyor belt. I STOOD RIGHT THERE AND SEARCHED FOR THE WATCH, it was gone. I walked a little further (about 10 steps) to avoid blocking the way and took all stuff out of my purse to search for it. Nothing - 1 minute later (YES WE HAVE CAMERA FOOTAGE), my husband went back to the conveyor belt area to check all the trays around. Found nothing - I reported the issue to the airport security team. No official report, no help from them. Later I had to fly back to Phu Quoc to make a scene and got official report and watched camera footage and Xray machine images.

                              <span>Hello! I am in Hanoi next month and given that Vietnam is one of the world&#x27;s biggest garment manufacturers, I am seeking shops that sell overstock clothing/shoes/gear from western brands (ie, Athleta, North Face, J. Lindeberg, etc.) 
 Any locations shared would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I recently visited Ho Chi Minh City and was amazed by the quality and unique designs of the helmets for kids. I think there is a great potential for such a business in India, and I am interested in exploring the possibility of importing these helmets.
 I am looking for helmet suppliers who can ship to India. Specifically, I am looking for suppliers who specialize in helmets for kids. I would appreciate any recommendations or suggestions on where I can find such suppliers.
 If you are a helmet supplier based in Ho Chi Minh City and are interested in exploring the Indian market, please reach out to me. I am keen to learn more about your products and services.
 Thank you in advance for your help and support. I look forward to hearing from you!

 If you know good spots up in Hanoi too, that’d be cool. Willing to take any local recommendations for any dish as well. I understand that best can be difficult to define and tends to be subjective, so whatever you tell me I’ll look into.

                              <span>So Im currently in negotiations to work with a well established startup in vn.
 They have already received 2 rounds of funding for 12 million USD and have yearly sales of almost 50 million. They are doing well and employing around 75 people, including native engineers and many skilled factory workers. 
 After this month of brutal internet, the series B round funders have issued an ultimatum for them to move design out of vietnam immediately. This was very embarrassing after a month of video call after video call was dropped; we were having a terrible time accessing code repositories hosted out of country, and a bunch of other problems due to new products relying on cloud connectivity. 
 the investors are foreign, frankly they have little faith in whats going on here. They seem to believe its not just a coincidence of all the internet cables but one breaking down; but rather a systematic problem, either in infrastructure, or govt mismanagement. They visited earlier this month, met with city officials in ho chi minh, and were appalled at the attitude, as well as conditions around the city, and believe growth in a high tech field will only be impeded by being here. 
 Frankly i cant argue. I love what we are working on and hate to have to turn away from this myself, but while they can work hard and compete, they will always be be hamstrung by access to real talent, and the 2nd world infrastructure. There is a culture of inefficiency in vn thinking that fester these kinds of problems. But founder is a rare brilliant vietnamese engineer who came home to make something good here, and looks like they wont be able to stay. 
 Come on vn, get your shit together.

                              <span>I will be going to Hanoi in a couple of weeks and need to book restaurants for me and my colleagues for 2 evenings. We will be staying in the Tay Ho district.
 Do you have any recommendations?
 Everything could be relevant, both fine dining and more casual.

                              <span>Hello all Vietnamese friends, I&#x27;m a white Czech and wanted your opinion on this: I shop a lot at the local Vietnamese store and I really like learning languages, so the last time I went to to the store, I asked the clerk (he may be the owner) if I could try my Vietnamese hello and he was smiling and went along and even tried to teach me more phrases, so I think I wasn&#x27;t rude. Also I was the only one in the store, it was early morning. What are your feelings on this, would you consider it rude or disrespectful? I wouldn&#x27;t try this if they were busy, or if I knew the person was born here, I just like the feedback and maybe it would make them feel more welcomed and make them remember their home country?
 I&#x27;m not sure, have at me!

                              <span>I’m seeing a lot of conflicting information about busses, travel time and pricing. What’s the best way? It says on maps 3h 17minutes. But most busses say closer to 5h. Money isn’t the issue so what would be our best option? I’ve seen posts saying the direct busses are quite bad. Please advise.

                              <span>Hi there. I’m moving to HCMC next month for work and I was just wondering how much dating differs to how it does in the west. I am a 23 year old boy from the UK and I have lived in Thailand for a year, is it similar? Also just to be clear I’m not talking about sex tourism, I’m on about actual dating someone, boyfriend girlfriend etc. Thank you

 How easy is it to get new sim cards with mobile internet plans as a foreigner? How is the network and internet speeds? How much do they usually cost?
 Do most cafes have wifi?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am a musician and music teacher in Canada. I teach at a school with students from all around the world and every week we listen to music from a different country. We are going to be exploring Viet Nam next.
 Can you recommend me some music to show my students? They are between ages 9-12 and we’re open to music from any genre.
 Thank you

 This is exactly how I feel trying to learn the Vietnamese pronouns, except that in Vietnam you have to guess a woman&#x27;s pronoun (based on age) without asking her and you get the evil eye if you get it wrong, lol.

                              <span>I am planning to travel to Vietnam, from India for 8-9 days with my parents in mid April. We are mostly looking for mountains or a place with pleasant weather in April. I have narrowed down to below places, but my parents can not trek, due to bad knees. Also we dont want it to be a hectic trip and want some time to enjoy a place as well. Can you please suggest me the places I can skip ? Vietnam : 1. Hanoi 2. Sapa 3. Ninh binh 4. Halong bay 5. Cat ba island 6. Mai chau 7. Pu luong 8. Moc chau 9. Ha giang
 Also, country other than Vietnam is also welcome(except Europe,since we can travel for 9 days only) .

                              <span>TW/CW: ANIMAL ABUSE, ANIMAL DEATH, HA#Gi#G 
 Hello there I’m not Vietnamese but I stumble upon a video on Facebook about a case of a pet salon where the workers unprofessionalism ended up in a dog’s death, by doing my research I found the original video on YouTube it’s called chewy hung to death at a pet spa by Brent Strydom (I really recommend not watching the video as it was incredibly graphic and horrible to see what happens to the dog) the user called Brent strydom seems to have been the owner of chewy and was claiming justice for what happened, it was uploaded on 2017 so idk if it got resolved or not since comments are deactivated and he didn’t left any social media on his channel to contact him so if anyone may know something about this case please let me know

 ​
 Tôi sẽ sử dụng ý tưởng &quot;Văn hóa Việt Nam&quot; cho một cuộc thi nghệ thuật. Tôi cần một số ý tưởng, vậy khi bạn nghe &quot;văn hóa Việt Nam&quot;, điều gì xuất hiện trong đầu? 
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều! :)

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s partly because of the CSGT not enforcing traffic laws, but in Australia and I assume other places at least 2/3 of the reason people follow traffic rules is because the public will publicly shame you if you don&#x27;t and if you&#x27;re unlucky someone will punch your face in. But it seems even the good drivers in Vietnam just roll over and accept it when someone tries to murder them on the roads.

They didn’t explain a lot. I shipped electronics before with no problems. Should I just assume that it’s lost at this point? The shipper said to wait 2-3 weeks. It’s coming up on 3 weeks and they’re not returning my calls. 
 Anyone encountered this issue? Are there specific products that warrant more scrutiny?

                              <span>I’ve been wanting to do the Ha Giang loop this next time I visit Vietnam, which was supposed to be mid/late April. However, our trip might have to be pushed back a few weeks, and I’m worried about the start of the rainy season interfering with good driving/riding conditions. My partner and I both have decent experience on motorbikes, but we haven’t decided if we want to do the EasyRider option or drive ourselves. Any input on weather considerations for the overall experience would be amazing!

                              <span>Cock Bait. There&#x27;s a bird of the feathered variety living somewhere outside my apartment. It never seems to sleep. It just makes the same incessant, droning &quot;Do do do do, dodoo&quot; all night and all day every ight and everyday. I have a feeling someone owns it but it must bother them too. Surely it keeps hundreds of people awake at night and infuriated during the day. Anyone experienced the same? (Don&#x27;t know what it looks like but I want to kill it!) Crap vegetarian, Hanoi.

                              <span>Hello r/vietnam,
 We are four friends who are planning a trip to Southeast Asia between December 2023 and January 2024. As we begin to plan our itinerary, we are hoping to find a relaxing spot where we can unwind and swim towards the end of our trip.
 We&#x27;ve heard so much about the natural beauty of your countries and we would love to experience it firsthand. As described in the post on r/laos linked below, we would like to do a wild experience in the first weeks. We are hoping to find a beach or lake where we can enjoy some peace and quiet at the end of our travel. We are also hoping to find a spot with some amenities nearby, like restaurants or shops, but we don&#x27;t want anything too crowded or touristy.
 We would really appreciate any recommendations you might have for a relaxing spot where we can swim and unwind during our trip. We are open to any and all suggestions, so please feel free to share your favorite spots and hidden gems with us.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

                              <span>Verse 1:
 I&#x27;m hopping on a plane
 Leaving right away
 My heart&#x27;s set on a different name
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 My flip-flops and my shorts
 Are waiting at the door
 To explore every hidden nook
 Of Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That&#x27;s never been too clean
 Where the traffic&#x27;s like a symphony
 And the street food&#x27;s obscene
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That&#x27;s got its own soundtrack
 With motorbikes and horns and shouting
 And sunsets that take my breath
 ​
 Verse 2:
 I&#x27;m ready to escape
 This monotonous place
 And see how life&#x27;s done in the East
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 From Pho to Banh Mi
 And everything in between
 The food here is so divine
 In Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 Where coffee&#x27;s a religion
 And there&#x27;s so much life on every street
 That I feel pure elation
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That never seems to sleep
 Where locals bike and tourists gawk
 And the air&#x27;s a little too thick
 ​
 Bridge:
 If I can make it here
 I&#x27;ll make it anywhere
 It&#x27;s up to you
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That&#x27;s got its own kind of magic
 With history that&#x27;s felt at every turn
 And energy that&#x27;s so classic
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That&#x27;s got its own style and flair
 With markets that hustle and bustle
 And a pulse that&#x27;s beyond compare
 ​
 Outro:
 Saigon, Saigon
 I wanna wake up in a city that screams my name
 Saigon, Saigon
 Where the hustle and bustle is always insane.

                              <span>VIP eleven passenger mini van from Da Lat to Nha Trang. Optional hotel pick-up ( I went to the bus station) and drop off directly at your destination hotel. There is one restroom stop on this route. We left on time and arrived on schedule. 
 First of all the staff are excellent. Friendly and helpful check in agent and driver. 
 Have no issue whatsoever with the customer service. For that this vendor earns three stars. 
 Areas of improvement:
 VIP bus was messy. Had water bottles and trash from previous guests. Mini van was a little worn. Not as pristine as the photos but not terrible either. 
 Where Cuc Tung looses stars is the driving experience. It was terrifying. The driver took unnecessary risks. There was low visibility due to fog and rain. Other travelers pulled off unto the side of the road but our driver&#x27;s speed barely slowed down around the twists and turns of the mountain two lane highway And, he regularly passed cars while in blind curves. It was three a* clenching hours I was thankful to have survived. 
 Safety should be a higher priority than timeliness.

                              <span>Hi everyone. Easy question. First time in Vietnam. I’ll be landing rather late, around 22:30 so maybe I’ll clear immigration by 11 pm. I have no cash so I’m hoping to withdraw at an atm at the airport. Is there anything open at that time? Thanks.

                              <span>Does anyone know if it is real jade being sold at the tip of Ngu Hanh Son (Marble Mountain) in Da Nang? Where are they sourced?
 I went to most stalls in the area, even the small street vendors and they all claim that the jade they sell is real. I am just curious about the authenticity because their jade were selling for only a fraction of what it would cost in gold stores. For example, some ranged between 50k - 1 mill. Also, what is the deal with the price difference? I assume some may be either fake or real. If anyone is familiar with the area, some advice on where to find an authentic dealer is highly appreciated.

 I‘ll Soon Travel To Vietnam and Want To Know How is your Relation To Cannabis? 
 I Know its Hardly punished By the Gouvernement if they catch you. Does this Happen often? Is the Police Looking especially for weed smokers? It is Hard To Buy ? Or do i Go better By Staying a Month away from it?

                              <span>I have a few questions about the housing market in HCMC. I’m really just asking out of curiosity since I can’t actually purchase a SFR in Vietnam. Reading about Seoul’s fucked-up housing situation kind of freaks me out so I’m kind of curious about what’s happening in HCMC. 
 My aunt “recently” sold their childhood house in D3 of HCMC for ~$500K USD. This is just what I overheard so I could honestly be mistaken, but this seems like a crazy amount for someone in VN to purchase considering the average annual salary of someone in HCMC. The only thing that stands out about this house to me is that it’s unlike the standard tall, narrow row houses with 4+ floors and had two floors, was much “wider” than it was tall, and had a backyard. It was a little out of place relative to the other structures around it. 
 Is this “standard” pricing throughout most of HCMC? Sorry, I know this is a particularly stupid question since HCMC is massive. 
 Do most people in HCMC “dream” about purchasing single family residences or has the goal shifted to purchasing a nice condo? Another family member told me that you can reasonably expect a newer condo to go for about ~$80K USD which still seems disproportionately high for the average salary, but I don’t know. 
 Who is still able to purchase a “house” or a “condo”? 
 Would you say the majority of people in HCMC today were born and raised there or moved there in the last 20 or so years?

                              <span>My wife is traveling to Ha Noi in March and this is our fourth trip to places in Vietnam. Last time she was in Ha Noi she was cold at night. I know. I know. It isn’t very cold… but she wants to know if there is a market or store there that sells warming blankets that you put on a bed and plug into the wall outlet? Where would she get that?

                              <span>How do I unlock my phone? 
 I have a Samsung Galaxy A52 Android phone running on Viettel. I&#x27;m planning to travel to the US and I want to us my phone with one of the carriers there. I checked T-Mobile and my phone&#x27;s technology and band appear to be compatible. But I don&#x27;t know if my phone is unlocked, or how to unlock it.
 I bought it in Danang from one of the big electronic stores. There are three A52 models. Mine is the regular A52 that does not support 5G. Model SM-A525F/DS.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello friends- a friend and I have both realized we have some recollection of a cover of &quot;The Rain&quot; by Orange Juice Jones in Vietnamese existing, and that it was not a freak fever dream from our childhood.
 We are desperate to find it because it is exactly what you would expect from similar covers. (Thai Tai&#x27;s &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; cover is peak 90s cheesy and unexpected.) I am actively combing through my playlists and discography to find it, and am wondering if the song goes by a different title in Vietnamese.
 I recall it was Trung Hanh or someone similar who sang it, but I cannot accurately recall.
 Thanks in advance,
 Keru

                              <span>Many shops require you to forfeit your bag when you walk in, or to put it in a locker.
 Many shops tape up your bag with sticky tape when you buy something.
 Some shops staple your receipt to the bag.
 etc.
  
My question is not why such practices exist (presumably all are somehow intended to minimize theft) and what they might indicate about society---that has been discussed here before.
 Instead, my question is where and how they originated. Can anybody shed light on where, how and when these practices became widespread in VN---and how they spread to become ubiquitous across the country?
 (Obviously these practices are not all unique to VN; that&#x27;s irrelevant.)

                              <span>I&#x27;m long-term renting a house here in VN and like most other houses there is a large-ish altar built in to a wall (complete with switched yellow lights) and another altar above the kitchen hearth. 
 I&#x27;m not Vietnamese and so the concept of ancestor veneration is totally foreign to me, but I appreciate that it&#x27;s a part of the culture here. In my own house though, I really don&#x27;t care. So the kitchen alter is currently holding spices, and the main home alter is bare (I was thinking it&#x27;d be good for books and knickknacks).
 My question: Am I going to offend someone or put them off if they visit my house? Am I exposing myself to some supernatural peril? I&#x27;ve previously lived in places with a mezuzah and Mary in a clamshell and don&#x27;t see how this is different, but my landlady is nice and if using an alter as a spice rack is disrespectful I don&#x27;t want to rock the boat.

                              <span>I am Vietnamese American. I was born in the United States, to Vietnamese Immigrants. Paris By Night for a long long time was my only cultural string to my heritage. I learned everything about Vietnamese culture from them.
 As I understand however, Thuy Nga has been struggling to expand it&#x27;s audience base. The younger generation especially in the US is not as tied into the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War so those older songs ( aren&#x27;t that appealing ). DVD sales are useless now. And the &quot; Young &quot; Singers that Thuy Nga has; well for one thing, they&#x27;re not that good at singing, and they&#x27;re not &quot; Young &quot;. One of Thuy Nga&#x27;s &quot; Young &quot; Singers, Diem Suong is 33 years old. And Nhu Loan is 41. 
 Enter Myra Tran. She was not recruited by Thuy Nga. But rather, came to them through American Idol. She&#x27;s now ( so far at least ) doing pretty well in Vietnam, while having some success in the US with Paris By Night.
 ​
 What do you guys think ? Can Thuy Nga adapt to new audience through Myra Tran ?

 Three of us, all women 25 to 27 years old from elsewhere, are living in district 3 for a month. 
 Where should we go on our weekends off? 
 What nature-based activities can we do in a weekend? 
 What should we visit after work? 
 Any great local food places? (Not wanting western food thank you) 
 Where should we go for shopping? - clothes, blankets, toiletries and so on :)
 Finally, what instagrams should we follow for recommendations? 
 Cam on, thank you 😊

                              <span>Hoping someone who was in the same situation can help me with the question: I have dual citizenship, one of them is VN. However I&#x27;ve just lost my VN passport and I need to flight somewhere this week. Is it possible to get out of VN using the other passport, which I did NOT use to enter?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 My Vietnamese friends tell me sports gear is relatively less expensive in Vietnam. And, am travelling to Vietnam before I go back to India and then UK. I am an Ironman athlete and have a cycle purchase pending.
 Kind members of this sub - please help a lost person know where to look for cycles to buy in the country. I will take them with me whilst leaving the country. Cycles and sports gear in general.

I use Verizon here in the US and was planning on purchasing the $10/day International Plan, until I saw the International Coverage map and saw that Verizon only offers 3G throughout Vietnam. I was curious if it would be better to just purchase a Vietnamese eSim in advance, and if so where could I? Thank you!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I will stay in Vietnam for several years, and I’m planning to buy a car. I&#x27;m only concerned about the car having a level 2 automated driving system ( I get used to in my country before) or full speed acc. My Vietnamese wife told me when the car was imported to Vietnam, they will cut off this function. But I believe some brands probably can find it.
 Can you recommend a car brand or model that has this system? Thank you a lot!

                              <span>Our tour bus just got into an accident on the way from Hanoi to Ha Giang. Everyone involved is safe. I&#x27;m pretty pissed at the driver and bus company though. Driver was driving like an asshole and I&#x27;m not surprised we got into an accident at all. Do I have any recourse here? They put us on another bus that only has room on the floor for the next 4 hours. I would expect some kind of compensation or money back for dealing with this, but as a non-vietnamese speaker I don&#x27;t know what chance I&#x27;ll have to actually get that.
 Edit: The bus company is Ngọc Cường VIP
 It was a head on collision with a commercial delivery truck

                              <span>Hello,
 Last night at around 9pm, a small brown dog of about 3kg and 8 months old escaped the house. The dog&#x27;s name is Bơ.
 The neighborhood the dog was lost in is near Kim Mã and Nguyễn Chí Thanh.
 If you have seen the dog or would have any information that could help out, I would appreciate it. Thank you

When I&#x27;m doing research it seems to me that tourist accommodation on beach destinations mostly are big hotels, tall buildings with all sorts of ammeneties, A/C and so on. I&#x27;m curious if there are any areas of Vietnam where the types of rustic low key bungalows/chalets common on e.g. island beaches in Thailand, are the norm?
 Thank you very much for your help and opinions 😊

                              <span>Dear Vietnam Redditors,
 Please, help me understand how Vietnam railways work, as I&#x27;m severely confused...
 I&#x27;m planning on visiting Vietnam in April, and wanted to book SE3 overnight train from Ninh Binh to Dong Hoi in advance. The problem is: I get different options depending on which website I use.
 If I try official dsvn.vn I can book a bed in 6-beds car, operated by, as far as I understand Vietnam Railways itself:
 https://preview.redd.it/wxgfmsgvj0ja1.jpg?width&#x3D;753&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;246be640edd3e9d999b8fc3d4658c29828db0bb6
 If I search through baolau.com, I am presented with 4-Berth sleeping cabin, operated by New Livitrans Express:
 https://preview.redd.it/7zruwhogk0ja1.jpg?width&#x3D;1143&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9c6e0b44d9e051972fdff8c43c82546deb1438e3
 Finally, 12go.asia shows two separate trains, seemingly departing at the very same time: one operated by Vietnam Railways, another by Violette Express Train. Both seems to offer 4-Berth Sleepers?
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/yqnx4uq8l0ja1.jpg?width&#x3D;1147&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;32b9b500ac10f136f14364c06286222c51c4c4bb
 Whom should I trust? Is it a single train with carts by different operators?
 Any help will be greatly appreciated! :)

I broke up with her due to differences in our culture and she kept fighting me over my past. Blocked her from social media in december 2022.
 Met my current girlfriend on Tinder in august 2022 and we hit off right away after meeting each other while I was on holiday in Vietnam. We decided on being exclusively to each other and we both deleted Tinder. I told her eventually I was a divorced man, but she continued to talk to me.

I can’t seem to find anything online about it. Any help is appreciated. I circled it in red for clarification.

                              <span>Staying in Saigon D1 near Ben Thanh Market and just wondering, whats with all the beauty salon/haircut places with all female staff wearing &quot;sexy&quot; outfits? I know it&#x27;s part of the tourist area, and I have seen the massage places scattered about that are obviously places catering to customers that want &quot;special&quot; services but the salon/haircut places seem different. Is it a gimmick? Something to draw clientele in? Get a haircut by a beautiful woman? Or is there a room in the back where someone&#x27;s getting jerked off? Was trying to figure it out but I&#x27;m stumped.

                              <span>The Americans always blamed northern Vietnam for invading southern Vietnam and that the United States simply came and supported southern Vietnam.
 They don&#x27;t know why they lost that war. It is clear that Vietnam is a unified whole, there is no &quot;southern Vietnam&quot; and there is no &quot;northern Vietnam&quot;. The Americans invaded Vietnam and the northern Vietnamese had the silent support of the people of South Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam was able to kick the American troops out of Vietnam.
 The Vietnamese people were in the old regime, injected with money by the US and spent it personally and without control. When the US withdrew, they lost funding, their living standards were reduced, so they were not used to it and tried to blame the communists. If the US wins, then Vietnam is now divided into two poles and will always be tense like &quot;North Korea and South Korea&quot; - obviously of the same origin but separated.

                              <span>I do know Vietnamese but how i form my sentences are often incomprehensible, please bear with me here. 
 So for context, I&#x27;m a high school student living in Ha Noi. Thanks to my parents&#x27; connections, I&#x27;ve got a part-time job that fits my schedule perfectly, and the job pays quite well for a high school student (unfortunately they wouldn&#x27;t hire outsiders). From that job I&#x27;ve saved up more than 100mil vnd. I dont know what to do with it. I&#x27;m definitely going to a college/university in the future, so should I set it aside to pay for my tuition fee? Or should I try to learn how to invest it? An online business, maybe? 
 What would you do if u were me,,,??? Oh and im gonna set aside like 30mil in case of emergencies.

Are there any concerns or prejudices against hiring overweight individuals, or do employers typically not mind an applicant&#x27;s weight? I would love to hear from anyone in the community who has experience with hiring IT professionals. Thanks for your help!

                              <span>i did the old quarter shopping and seen all the merchandise thats generally for sale (most sell the same wares)
 wondering if its worth going to a night market for shopping? are there different merchandise? or mostly the same as regular old quarter shopping?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have heard some people say you can buy almost anything from the pharmacies in Vietnam without a prescription (even though it&#x27;s frowned upon)
 Was wondering if anyone can confirm it is still possible to pick up penacillin and other antibiotics prescription free .
 Doctors have been backed up here for weeks and have a lingering sore throat . 
 Thanks in advance .

                              <span>Hello. So, an opportunity to work in Vietnam was given to me. Just wanna ask how much is the average living allowance, housing and utilities expenses, and things about transportation.
 How is the experience for expats in the country?
 Will really appreciate your help.
 Edit*** Location will be in Go Vap District. I will be working as a teacher. (what’s the average rate for teachers?)

                              <span>I&#x27;m set to go to Vietnam in just three weeks to teach English with VUS. It will be my first time in Vietnam. I have been given given two choices for where to work: in District 12 on the west side of the airport or in the far east of District 2. I&#x27;ve been told District 12 is more likely to be where I will be working.
 With that in mind, where do you recommend I live? I want to have a fairly urban lifestyle with lots to do, see, eat, drink, and shop. Districts 1, 3, 4 and such look quite nice but are super far. I&#x27;m not sure what is in District 12 as it looks quite far, so I&#x27;m not sure if it has more comfortable apartments or not. Any advice would be welcome.
 Also, is it generally easy to change your working location after a few months?

                              <span>Hi everyone, throwaway account so that my SO doesn’t see this post. 
 We’re a same sex couple planning a trip to VN in a few months. I’m intending on proposing to them at a semi private venue (there may be spectators around the area, but it’s nowhere public).
 I know there’s a growing positive sentiment towards LGBTQ rights in VN, but I’m not sure how friendly locals would be to seeing something like a marriage proposal. Will I be inviting negative reactions or reception? I just don’t want to create an awkward environment for us in doing this.

The snacks were in a transparent pack, it tasted and looked like cheese &quot;Yopokki snack&quot;, but small in size. Tastes sweet at first, then spicy. I would really like to know what it is called. My searches have been fruitless.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I know this might be a long shot but this is probably the only place where someone can help me with this question.
 I&#x27;m currently working on a video of my trip in Vietnam last December and i would love to start the video with someone saying something in Vietnamese. I will be using only the audio so no need to film yourself or anything. Just a recording on your phone will be fine, if possible with as little background noise as possible, although i know that&#x27;s difficult in Vietnam.
 The sentence i&#x27;d like to use is something like: &quot;Hi! I would like to tell you about my Vietnam experience. Are you ready?&quot; But of course translated to Vietnamese. 
 If anyone is willing to help me out, that&#x27;ll be amazing!

                              <span>Hi all, I will be moving to Vietnam next month and have just been informed that my home campus for the school I will work for is in Binh Long (near Aeon mall). 
 I don’t know much about this area, as when I lived in HCM before (not for long), I lived in Thao Dien and only really went to D1/D2/D3. Also most videos I watch are mainly based in these districts as well. 
 I want somewhere that’s not extremely touristy/‘expat-y’ (like Thao Dien and most of D1), but also has plenty of stuff to do and places to eat/drink, and not too far from touristy areas I can visit if I wanted (such as Nguyen hue). I originally planned to live in D3 as it seemed to fit these criteria.
 I realise BL isn’t actually that far from these areas, but I’m guessing with traffic and other factors, it would make the daily commute quite long and tedious. 
 I’d also want somewhere with decent accommodation options for around 8tr. 
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just received an ESL teaching offer from a well-known company in Vietnam. I would appreciate some advice on one of the terms in the contract, as follows:
 &quot;In addition, by law, [company name] must be able to show at such an audit as referenced in the Decree No. 03/2014/ND-CP Article 8, full and complete details of all employees who are working at [company name] […] Only original documents (they will state &#x27;This is notarised as an original&#x27; or similar) will be returned to you at the time of your leaving [company name]. Any notarised copies will be returned after not more than 3 months.&quot;
 So, I am planning to notarise and legalise copies of my degree and CELTA certificates, and give these to the company so they can process my work permit. I don&#x27;t want to spoil my originals with stamps, and I&#x27;d be reluctant to hand over my originals in any case.
 I&#x27;m from the UK, and the process for notarising and legalising copies for use in Vietnam is very time-consuming and expensive. I&#x27;m unclear why the company would need to keep these officially notarised and legalised copies rather than a digital scan or physical copy of these, if it&#x27;s just for audit purposes (a copy of a copy if you like). I&#x27;m concerned that it might be a ploy to stop me obtaining a separate work permit in the event that I wanted to work for another company (after the 3 month period stipulated).
 Is this standard practice, or should I be concerned? Any experience or advice would be much appreciated.

 Bus was 30 minutes late and the &quot;bus station&quot; is a desk in front of a shanty restaurant/home. 
 That could be forgiven but the bus is disgusting. Nothing has been wiped down on this bus in probably years. It is old, worn, and full of germs 
 Trash all over the place, shoe bags are reused, cramped seats, no wifi no charging station, no blanket, no water, no privacy curtain, very little headroom, and an aggressive driver. Speeding and honking his horn excessively. 
 I hope I don&#x27;t get foot fungus or some crap. .

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m currently in Vietnam and am considering getting a Vietnamese drip coffee maker. There are hundreds of generic metal or pottery style ones, but I&#x27;ve found a much more unique one, hand made with copper or bronze.
 Because it is a lot more unique, it&#x27;s also a lot more expensive (3 or 4 times more expensive). It feels weird to bargain because it&#x27;s a small handmade store, but it is quite expensive, more money then I would like to pay. Would it be fair to ask for a cheaper price? I wouldn&#x27;t cut it as low as I would with more traditional street souvenir shops. I&#x27;m not sure if there is etiquette around where to try and negotiate prices. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>UPDATE: My wife just clarified that it would be great if it could be mixed and made into cookies.
 My wife is trying to make some veggie for our kid who is under a year old but he has a few teeth and can chew soft and small food. My wife wants to use her recipe but we live in a small town and we cannot find any brocolli here.
 What veggie do Vietnamese usually give their young child and how do you prepare it? We do have premade babies food from Avakids and Concung but we want to try some home-made solution. Any recipe would be appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m from the US, and I&#x27;m contemplating a vacation to Saigon D8. I am on a very strict /r/carnivore diet due to an autoimmune condition, and I mostly eat only beef, butter and eggs. Occasionally seafood. I eat around 1 lb of meat per day, sometimes a little more.
 ​
 How difficult will it be to maintain my strict diet while in Saigon? I usually cook at home, but will probably have to eat out while there.
 ​
 When I&#x27;m desperate in the US, I can even go to McDonalds and eat the meat patties without the bun or lettuce, sauce, etc. Is the meat at McDonald&#x27;s comparable to the US meat patties in quantity &amp; quality?
 ​
 Thanks for your input &amp; advice.

                              <span>Hey all. I&#x27;m going to be in Vietnam for a while but I&#x27;ll still be working US hours. So it would currently be from 9PM to 5AM. I was wondering if anyone has been in the same situation and how did you manage?
 Is it easy to get food at night and in the early morning? Would it be more beneficial for me to sleep right after work or to sleep before work given a typical vietnamese day? Anything else I should keep in mind while there?
 Thanks

                              <span>10 years ago, I would say maybe 10% of Vietnamese are fat. Now I would think it&#x27;s about 40%. Maybe it&#x27;s all the American fast food restaurants opening in Vietnam.

                              <span>My husband and I are travelling to Vietnam in 2 weeks time starting in Hanoi and travelling south to HCMC stopping via Hue and Hoi An over the course of 2 weeks. We booked to go this time of year as we thought it was the best compromise of temperature/ being dry. Getting excited I checked the weather forecast earlier today and was a bit disheartened to see that it looks rainier than I was expecting. 
 I would love to hear from anyone in any of those places at the moment what the weather&#x27;s really like and if I should maybe re-think what I was planning and packing a few more waterproofs 😅
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;m a European, I work full remote and I&#x27;m in Japan now. It&#x27;s pretty cold here so I&#x27;m planning a 10-12 days work holiday trip to Vietnam soon, end of February beginning of march probably, looking for some spring like weather.
 I&#x27;ve read a couple of posts where people tend to lean Hanoi rather than Ho Chi Minh as a tourist destination but I am not sure. I would be fine with either. I understand Hanoi si less vibrant, more traditional, which is ok. I&#x27;m not looking for nightlife as I will be working. I don&#x27;t want to exclude Ho Chi Minh though.
 It would be my first visit to Vietnam and I&#x27;m pretty excited. My concern is the weather, as I read that Hanoi tends to be colder? I&#x27;m leaving Japan for that reason, so I don&#x27;t want to find myself in the same situation.
 Also, I would like to work with my laptop around the city and enjoy the famous Vietnamese coffee culture. Is it safe? I&#x27;m used to Japan where pickpocketing is not a thing and I read some posts here pointing out that snatching phones is rather common. Is that true? I would be screwed without my computer. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

 I will be in Vietnam for 3 weeks in April. I still need some equipment and I noticed that some products I am interested in are &quot;Made in Vietnam&quot;. 
 Now I was wondering if I can buy these products cheaper in Vietnam/Hanoi than in Germany? 
 I am specifically interested in some products of the outdoor company &quot;Patagonia&quot;.
 Thanks for the help

                              <span>Hi folks!
 I will be visiting Hanoi for 6d5n in April, spending 2days on a cruise in Ha Long Bay.
 It&#x27;s our first time to Hanoi, and my parents&#x27; first time in Vietnam.
 If anyone has recommendations on eateries, interesting places to visit, or tips on navigating the city and would be so kind to share, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>The continued economic turmoil there got me wondering about this. If there was civil unrest that threatened the Laos government, what would happen if China sent troops in under the guise of supporting the government or protecting their investments.? Given Laos has be a defacto puppet of Vietnam for much of it&#x27;s existence and and there&#x27;s always been rumours of VN troops supporting the government even in recent times against the Hmong and in the past against Thailand, would there be a response? I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Vietnam at least considers Laos a part of it&#x27;s sphere of influence, and while China would presumably prefer to continue to buy influence as they&#x27;re currently doing in Laos and Cambodia, civil unrest could change things. Not saying it&#x27;s likely, just wondering what would the reaction of the VN government and people be?

                              <span>Hello! I’m visiting Vietnam for the first time in early June. I’ll be landing in Ho Chi Minh City and that will be my planned home base but I want to travel to several places in the two weeks that I have. I’m planning on a day trip to Cu Chi and am wondering what the recommendation would be for visiting the Mekong delta. I think I could spend two days there based on other places I want to see. Would you recommend I stay a couple nights there somewhere or should I plan on maybe two different day trip tours? I would greatly value your advice.

 Other than that, what are places I must visit, if any?

                              <span>I was browsing around and I saw in US that there are a set of test to become a naturalized citizen.
 Does Vietnam have any thing similar to that? What are the tests? How would one qualify to naturalize? 
 When I look into any type of TRC or naturalization I see things mainly regarding investment. I am curious if there are other ways.

I know the airport would have, but I’m sure they are very overly priced. I need to plug it into the hotel power and use my Singapore (UK) 3-prong adapters to charge my devices.

She’s used to very mild temperate weather. What are good places for her to play and run around every day? Any indoor options in the city center? Any advice or measures I should take? Thank you.

                              <span>In the last several days, I have not heard much about Vinfast other than the fact that they have discounted their VF 8 to compete with the Tesla Model Y and that they cut their North American workforce. Given that Vinfast has been more silent recently, I am curious what would happen to Vinfast and Vingroup as a whole in the coming months and years? Would Vinfast pull out of the US market and would Vinfast likely crumble just like what happened to Vinsmart? Also, if Vinfast crumbles, what does it mean for Vingroup and Vietnam as a whole?

                              <span>Ok, so I see questions recurring here on importing things from other countries into Vietnam. I do this from time to time, so figured I could tell you what to expect by documenting the last batch a little.
 First, I only import non-food items. My understanding is importing food is more difficult.
 Second, I import for personal use, and pay full duties (usually 10%). I could probably import as my company, but the paperwork is not worth the time for the fees saved, so I don&#x27;t bother and just pay.
 Here&#x27;s the general process:
  
Order your things. Keep the invoice (or other proof of payment) and shipping manifest. You can ship to a residential address without issue. Use a courier service, they will facilitate the paperwork. I typically use UPS or FedEx. 
 Be sure to leave a correct phone numbe…</span>

I am more so looking for second-hand, vintage, handmade, one of a kind type things. Any other markets in other cities that would fit this list and are worth visiting? Thanks!

 Thank you very much

The best bang for my buck looks to be Honda Winner 150CC. My concern is I am a larger gentleman, 125kg. Will this bike be sufficient for a 3 week trip from Danang to Hanoi or should I opt for a larger bike?

                              <span>Hello! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m in the right place for this question but I&#x27;m searching for a vietnamese knife for cooking. Can be traditional/modern. Maybe someone knows something where you can buy good quality for a decent price. I will stay at Hanoi, Ninh binh, Sapa, cat ba, Hoi an, Saigon and phu quoc.

                              <span>My wife and I are planning on coming to Vietnam next year on vacation. I just read that Vietnam dose not recognize the international drivers license I can get issued here in the US. 
 We were hoping to rent a motor scooter like we did in Thailand when we visited.
 How would I go about driving legally?
 If there is no way to get a legal driving permit for my trip how big of a trouble would I get in if I got pulled over while driving?
 In Thailand my international permit was valid, but I saw others get pulled over and asked to pay a 300bhat &quot;fine&quot; to be on their way.
 Please any advice is welcome, I really want to obey the law and do things right. But my wife and I like to explore and hike and get off the beaten path if you will and not being able to drive ourselves around could get costly and put a real damper on our trip.
 Thanks in advance for your time and help. Cheers

                              <span>It is a bit of a long shot but here goes. So my girlfriend and a friend af hers are supposed to fly to Vietnam for a 2 week holiday but currently my girlfriend is stranded on Frankfurt airport because her express visa (or visum) application didn&#x27;t get trough on time. She wasn&#x27;t allowed on the flight because of this. My question to my fellow redditors is this: do you know of a way to try to get her application rushed trough. Or maybe someone knows someone that works at the governement departement that handles visa applications? Or maybe enter a second application? 
 It is a real longshot bu let&#x27;s see if reddit can help.
 Eitherway i appreciatie anyone reading this.

                              <span>Has anybody done this recently? We always have used an agent for this but not this time as it&#x27;s too expensive tbh. My new company will sponsor me the costs and paperworks, (1st time for me as I usually have to shoulder the cost in my previous company. I am not a teacher btw.). This is the first time they will hire a foreigner as well so there HR is also not so familiar. They will assist me as much as they can but brunt of the research will be from my end. I jusy need to know the process in General. They will sponsor me but as much as possible not going through an agent. 
 Ill be doing this first time and I am aware Vietnam always changes rules regarding this. Is this even doable by a foreigner (not married to a Vietnamese too) so language could pose a problem... Just want to get an idea if this is even possible.

                              <span>As an African American a source of stress is just getting basic services you are use to having access to in the states. 
 Since leaving Texas no one has cared for my hair like my sister, Shamonica Alexander, Trina Stoker and Andise Altine, two stylist I&#x27;ve been seeing for years.
 Last Sunday. I had my hair braided in Vietnam by a woman from the Congo who pretty much tried her damnest to pull all the hair out of my scalp into too tight cornrows. I had to take them down two days later. 
 Well, I don&#x27;t do my own hair and without my trusted hair stylists to rescue the tangled mess. I had a temper tantrum and cut my hair off. I initially wanted to shave it but I only had scissors. 
 Today, I looked for a salon to make me look more presentable but literally had people just flat out deny me service. 
 It took three attempts and a couple of salons to get someone to shape my hair but finally got this kind man to agree to it at N&#x27;Black Barbershop in Phan Thiet, Vietnam
 He was gentle. He didn&#x27;t tear through my hair but most of all I felt respected. I&#x27;m super grateful to him. 
 Haven&#x27;t had much luck today getting someone to give me a manicure or pedicure. Will save that for another day.

                              <span>I made a similar post about cockroaches in my previous apartment, I’ve moved and haven’t seen a single cockroach but today I opened my oatmeal (which had been tightly sealed) and it was full of these ants :( I’ve noticed a few of them crawling around before but paid them no mind - feel like I should do something about this now! What can I do/where can I buy something to sort this out? (Aka kill them)

                              <span>Hi, 
 I’m a Canadian who travelled from Malaysia, now going to Ho Chi Minh, Da Nang, and lastly Hanoi.
 I’d consider myself very tattooed (both arms full, legs, and chest) from artists in Canada and some Malaysia. 
 I can’t find a definitive guideline for appropriate pricing for tattoos. Can anyone shed some light on standard hourly rates? 
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hey there, sorry if this is annoying or the incorrect place to post something like this. 
 I am currently travelling from New Zealand and accidentally left both my wallet and passport in the back of the seat in front of me on the train today.
 I caught the 15:30 train from Ga Sai Gon to Ga Binh Thuan yesterday before taking a grab further to our accommodation.
 I arrived at Ga Binh Thuan and got off the train in a rushed folly. Leaving my thungs.
 I have attempted to contact police tonight, called over 11 times, and was only received once. Before the phone was hungup.
 This is whatever, and I am sure to contact police on the phone or in person tomorrow.
 If anyone might know where my things might be/ who best to contact. 
 I will also try the train company but do not know the exact best course of action.
 Ultimately, I have travel inaurance but hope I can resolve this without resorting to it.
 Thank you kindly for any input/help/advice.

                              <span>Hi, I came to Hanoi yesterday and I&#x27;m trying to find Vietnam-made souvenirs but all I couldn&#x27;t find genuine stuff that I could buy and use on regular basis to remind me of this country. What I found were mostly toys or small plastic/wood low quality items that were painted in a rush, probably even made in China.
 What are some decent souvenirs that I can find in Hanoi? 
 Other than decorative stuff, what else I can buy, like any special spice or snack?

                              <span>We arrived to Hanoi today, the hotel we had booked said they had electricity problems in our room, and showed us another room in another building far below the standard we had booked. We declined because we could see there were other hotels with good offers on Booking.com.
 Now it&#x27;s 2 hours later and we have visited 4, 4 star hotels in the old quarter who all had &quot;Superior/deluxe/..&quot; rooms listed as available at about 70-80% discounts on Booking and when we arrived to see the room they said that it is not available.
 We decided to book some Airbnb outside old quarter instead 😅.
 Is this normal practice in Old quarter/Hanoi/Vietnam or were we just very unlucky.

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;m planning on riding from HCM to Hanoi next month on a motorcycle. What would be a reasonable amount of KM to complete per day? I am just concerned about road conditions and how they would impact travel speeds. I&#x27;m a competent rider and ride a bike every day at home, have ridden in Thailand before.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m travelling to Vietnam soon, 2-3 days in HCMC, a few days on Phu Quoc island, a lot of time in Tan Chau.
 I&#x27;m very into tea and was hoping to find some tea shops that sell good quality loose leaf teas in HCMC and/or Tan Chau. As far as HCMC goes, I&#x27;ll be in District 1 and District 3, with my tight schedule I won&#x27;t be able to leave these areas in HCMC. 
 Any tips? I&#x27;ve found a few on google that look potentially promising (such as Trà Việt), but I wanted to know if there were better shops that I&#x27;m probably missing since I don&#x27;t speak the language, or just some place that&#x27;s a hidden gem. 
 Second, would tea be an appropriate gift for someone&#x27;s family in Vietnam? We have other gifts we&#x27;re bringing (Family member is getting married), but I thought I might add to it with a set of nicely presented teas as a thank you for hosting us.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>Reddit recently has confirmed that it has been hacked. The hacker was able to gained access to some internal documents, code and systems at the social media company. To the user side, currently there are no evidence that the attack revealed any non-public data. However, I recommend people changing their reddit password immediately and setting up 2FA if not.
 ​
 Reddit gần đây đã xác nhận rằng họ đã bị hacker tấn công. Kẻ tấn công đã có quyền truy cập một số tài liệu, code và hệ thống của công ty. Về phía người dùng, hiện tại chưa có bằng chứng nào về việc rò rỉ dữ liệu cá nhân của người dùng nhưng mình vẫn khuyến khích các bạn thay đổi mật khẩu tài khoản và lập mã xác thực 2 bước cho tài khoản nếu chưa.

                              <span>Recently, ChatGPT is becoming a hot topic in Vietnam because of how accessible it is to normal users and follow that trend is a booming scam market regarding to create a ChatGPT account. Because of that, I decided to make a post to guide you how to create your own legitimate ChatGPT account.
 Dạo gần đây, ChatGPT đã trở thành chủ đề nóng được quan tâm ở Việt Nam vì dịch vụ dễ dàng tiếp cận đối với người dùng bình thường, chính vì sự bùng nổ đó kéo theo vấn nạn lừa đảo liên quan đến việc tạo tài khoản ChatGPT. Chính vì thế mình quyết định viết bài post hướng dẫn tạo tài khoản ChatGPT chính gốc của bạn.
 ​
  
Because ChatGPT is not supported in Vietnam, you need a VPN to change your IP to another country. In case you don&#x27;t have a VPN, vn-z forum provided a lot of vpn account for you to choose. Bởi vì ChatGPT không hỗ trợ ở Việt Nam, bạn sẽ cần VPN để chuyển địa chỉ IP của bạn sang nước khác. Trong trường hợp bạn không có VPN, diễn đàn vn-z có cung cấp tài khoản VPN cho các bạn thoải mái sử dụng.
 You need a foreign phone number for verification, I recommended smspool because it is reliable, cheap (depends on the country, most likely cost less than 1$) and I used it for my ChatGPT account myself. Các bạn cũng sẽ cần đến số điện thoại nước ngoài để xác minh danh tính, mình khuyến khích các bạn dùng smspool vì nó ổn định, rẻ (tuỳ đất nước bạn chọn, giá thành sẽ thấp hơn 20,000đ).
  
Good luck/Chúc may mắn
 Edit: ChatGPT is now supporting in Vietnam (11/2/2023), however you will need ChatGPT Plus for 20$. Depends on your need, my guide will be cheaper for you. Để tạo tài khoản ChatGPT ở Việt Nam tại thời điểm hiện tại, bạn cần đăng kí ChatGPT Plus với giá 20$ (470,000đ). Tuỳ nhu cầu sử dụng mỗi người, người dùng phổ thông không có 400,000đ dư giả để tiêu thì cách trên mình hướng dẫn rẻ hơn.

                              <span>Hello!
 In two weeks I will be accompanying my wife and our daughter on a short term business trip to Hanoi. Probably three months with short side trips to HCMC.
 What kind of weather can I expect?
 Is it jeans and hoodie or shorts and t-shirt?
 I&#x27;ve been to Vietnam a few times, but never in the north in winter/spring. So I usually pack t-shirts, shorts, light trekking pants and light trekking shirts.
 I&#x27;m a pretty big guy from the Netherlands and have no problems with cold, but heat gets to me quickly.
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Tonight is my last night in Vietnam, and I never got a chance to try Bia Hoi. Is it worth seeking it out and rushing back to catch my airport shuttle, or is it nothing special compared to, say, Huda, Tiger, and Halong Sapphire?

 We are thinking of going around Hanoi to get everyone small gifts, our friend, her mom, dad and even the cats haha.
 What are some small gift ideas that would be appreciated? :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be heading to Thailand next week, and I have a TPBank VISA debit card.
 It was issued at the beginning of COVID, couple years back.
 I haven&#x27;t been out of the country in 3.5 years, and will be heading to Thailand - does anyone have any experience using a TPBank debit card in Thailand? 
 Or should I buy some Thai Baht from the gold shops/Noi Bai airport?
  
Decathlon accepts it for online payment, but Lazada doesn&#x27;t (if that helps).

                              <span>Hello, I was curious about whether or not you are allowed to rock climb at Marble Mountain in Da Nang? I was there today and saw the one sport route and the other bolts for setting up anchors. I did more research and saw that tours were operated by Phat Tire Adventures. I went to their website but could not find any information. I contacted them but have still not received a response. I would prefer to climb there without a guide, as I have all the stuff, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was allowed. It seems strange that it is right in the middle of the main pathway. Can anyone lend any insight into this? Thanks!

Also if anyone could recommend the best phrase to print out to show to chefs to inform them of this, it would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you!

                              <span>Hey, Vietnam community! I just wanted to share a video I made about the dark history of Li Xi. For those who don&#x27;t know, Li Xi is a popular celebration in Vietnamese culture, but not many people know about the darker aspects of its history. This video delves into that history and provides a new perspective on this important celebration. I think it&#x27;s an interesting and eye-opening watch, and I hope you all find it as educational as I did. Check it out and let me know what you think!

                              <span>Hi everyone, just looking for some advice. Im going to be traveling around Vietnam for 3/4 weeks in March next year. Starting in the north amd making my way down. When im further south so of may family are joining me and im looking for somewhere amazing for them to stay. Id love it to be an island, ive been looking at a lot about phu quoc, but ive heard and seen stories about it being super touristy, a lot of building work going on and a lot of rubbish on some of the beaches. Is this true? Are there any other island or costal places you would recommend that are nicer with beautiful beaches and scenery. Any help would be amazing.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m planning on relocating to Ho Chi Minh City in the near future, and am having trouble finding information online regarding the availability and costs of psychiatric help in the city. Right now I am on two psychiatric medications. While it appears it would not be too difficult to purchase these medications from pharmacies, I would like to have someone in the city who can monitor the effects of the medication, ideally on a monthly basis. 
 Are psychiatrists who have a good grasp of English hard to find in Vietnam? 
 How much would a visit generally cost? 
 Would going to a private hospital monthly to be evaluated be a feasible alternative? 
 I&#x27;ve read about issues with &#x27;fake&#x27; versions of medications; is there a way to ensure I can avoid these? 
 Any additional insights would be greatly appreciated!

I could take recommendations for any other good Vietnamese movies and find other ways to watch them 🏴‍☠️. Thank you!

 I am looking for advice on what would be the best route to travel around the norther region, leaving from hanoi and returning back there. 
 There are many route options it looks like and want to choose one with lots of good scenery, fun riding, and cool spots to stop.
 We have about 8 days. Also what&#x27;s your favorite bike rental shop, with something a bit bigger, like an xr150 or similar adventure bike. 
 Thanks a bunch!

                              <span>I’m going to Vietnam to visit some extended family next month and would like some recommendations of what kind of snacks/candies to bring. 
 My family has only ever brought chocolate (snickers, peanut m&amp;ms, milky ways) and wrigley’s gum. 
 I was thinking about bringing some hot Cheetos, starburst, skittles, warheads, and sriracha for them this time too.

 My partner and I have been planning to travel Vietnam for around 1-2 weeks. We want to explore with the little time we have and we would like to hear your suggestions.
 We will be needing strong internet connection because we still have to manage our business at home from time to time.
 Thank you!

 I’m going to be in Can Tho for some days and I want to photograph along the river. I’m looking for a translator so I can speak to locals. The only requirement would be to be speak Vietnamese, English and to be an open and communicative person. 
 Any hints are appreciated!

                              <span>I just got a 5 years Visa Exemption because my parents were born in Vietnam, then I asked in the embassy what am I allowed to do there with this Visa and if can work..etc, she basically said &quot;you can do whatever you want, just remember to leave the country after 180 days&quot;. 
 -Is this true? Am I allowed to work there? Can I extend the 180 days limit for another 180 days without leaving the country?
 -Any other app to find a place to stay besides Agoda, Booking, Airbnb...?
 -Any recommendations for a good Vietnamese teacher/school for beginners?
 What should I do/know/prepare or whatever before going to live in Hanoi from 15 March to 15 June?
 Any information you would like to share will be really appreciate it!
 Thank you and sorry, English is not my main language.

                              <span>We&#x27;re going to Vietnam soon, staying in HCMC for only 3 nights and originally planned to stay in a hotel but came across advert for home stay with pics of ppl eating together, hanging out etc. So now thinking to do this instead, to meet locals and really see their culture and how they live.
 Good idea? Anyone done this? By the look of travel vlogs it&#x27;s what backpackers do in the north, in the mountains, but is is common in the city? 
 Pls share any experience with this. Thanks x

                              <span>I am 27 and finishing up a degree in the next 6 months to get my CELTA and hopefully teach in either Vietnam or Taiwan. This is something I&#x27;ve wanted since I was a teenager and I will be 28 by the time this becomes possible. My motivations beyond teaching English is to learn the language, however difficult Vietnamese may prove.
 I have been debating between Taiwan or Vietnam for years and have considered as many factors as possible, but one I would like some insight on is how difficult it may prove to form friendships with locals. I do not expect anyone to be enamored by foreigners and I am not looking for super deep friendships. I am not looking for a best friend and I am not looking for a significant other. I don&#x27;t expect to be grabbing dinner or drinks constantly with locals. But I do want to be friends with locals and not solely rely on other expats.
 How realistic is this in Vietnam? I understand given my age where most people will be raising families and the language/cultural differences, that it will prove to be difficult. But once I get a working grasp of Vietnamese (however long and difficult that may be), could I expect to create some friendships with people besides other expats? From what I&#x27;ve read, this may be easier in Vietnam vs Taiwan, and I was looking for insight. I consider myself very friendly and I am always eager to make new friends, so normally this is not difficult for me but I have no previous experience to Vietnam nor living in a country where English is not the first language.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;ve returned to Vietnam recently and need to do a border run for my work permit. A friend of mine said that recently, staff at Phạm Ngũ Lão bus station told him the bus to Moc Bai doesn&#x27;t run any more, and to either take a private taxi or book a bus to Phnom Penh and then just get off at the border (which is obviously a lot more expensive).
 ​
 Google still shows it as an active bus route though. Can anyone confirm?

 My mom usually spends lots of time consuming content that is automatically recommended on Facebook, which in my opinion, is very low-quality and boring. If it matters, her favorite hobbies are singing, gardening, and maybe a bit of stock investment (more like calculated gambling). 
 Any suggestions are appreciated 🙏

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;ll fly into Da Nang tomorrow from Malaysia. I&#x27;m a non-stop traveller, therefore I always bring all my belongings of which my drone is part of. I know that bringing a drone into the country is legal, however flying without permission is not and I reached out to so many officials in Vietnam and my local Vietnamese embassy to apply - without luck of course.
 By now, I couldn&#x27;t care less about not being able to fly without a permit, but I&#x27;m worried about importing the thing via Da Nang, an airport that&#x27;s notoriously famous for its customs officers&#x27; outdated mindset, with them confiscating drones. Obviously I want to avoid that and so I&#x27;m asking if anyone has made any recent experiences there and if it&#x27;s still true that they only scan carry-on, but not checked bags?

                              <span>Just got home from a 3 week vacation in Vietnam. Spent the first week in Saigon, second week at my grandparents place and third week in Phu Quoc. Amazing times. Met amazing people and did a lot of fun things. 
 When I was in Vietnam, I was having fun but also stressed at the same time. There were too much people and traffic. As an introvert, I don’t like when it’s overcrowded. The weather was also too hot for my taste. I was also worried about getting pickpocketed, but luckily nothing happened.
 I told my mom several times that I wanted to go home. And I was so happy when it was finally time to travel back home. But now after returning, I suddenly feel depressed. I suddenly miss my relatives and all the adventures we did. I miss the food and culture also. 
 I told myself that this would be the third and final time I’m travelling to Vietnam, but now I’m itching to go back in the future. Does anyone else feel the same after their trip?

                              <span>This is not a critique of the country or the culture, just a curiosity question.
 I have a couple of female friends who over the past year who told me they are going to get married. 
 One of them told me that her parents are close with the parents of the the impending husband, and that her parents have wanted her to marry the guy for a while. 
 The other is being told by her parents she has to leave Vietnam and go and marry someone in Europe. Its a bit of a match making thing through friends of the family, even though she isn&#x27;t that keen on going. 
 There was another very similar story I came across too this week via a friend&#x27;s friend.
 Is this common? For the parents to essentially choose (or have an extremely strong preference) for who the girl should marry? I always thought this was more an Indian/South Asian thing.

                              <span>I have been living in Vietnam for 5 years. I own a company here and have recently noticed a drastic change in banking policies. MB bank no longer allows foreigners to hold or use a debt card. VIB allows existing foreigner customers to have an ATM card but cannot use that card for purchases in shops or businesses. 
 Is this a change in policy with all banks or only these two?

 May I know your thought on this? And should we do something to end its monopoly in the english-testing market in Vietnam?

                              <span>My last visit was the month of March 2020. 
 It was one of if not the greatest month of my life even if by week three it felt like I was being chased by COVID.
 A lot of sites we had planned to visit didn&#x27;t happen since most places shut down. At the time we had no idea of the future and really thought we would just visit the following year. Not knowing the world would be shut down. 
 It&#x27;s almost three years later and has life really changed. I&#x27;m a home owner now, have a daughter who is 14 months and a son on the way. 
 Life has become very adulty. 😂 
 Traveling with my wife will never be the same but we always talk about our time in Vietnam.
 It&#x27;s beautiful, the country is appasulty beautiful! The people are appasulty beautiful! We made such great friends on our trip even with the language barrier. Friends who we still keep in touch with till this day. 
 I know we&#x27;ll be back one day most likely when we&#x27;re old. Going to have to skip out on the sleep buses and over night train rides at the point. 😆
 I hope we can visit much sooner than later with or without the kids. I would love to bring my children with me, I want them to be as well traveled as myself.
 I really just wanted to let everyone know how much I miss and love Vietnam and hope to see everyone sooner than later. 
 Ps. I still have yet to find Cao Lau in the states.

The thing is, I can be picky with the design, so I’d like to find a shop that has pictures I can reference.
 Any Saigon shops that ship to Da Nang would be cool too.
 I live in Texas and there aren’t any good shops here, except for in Houston, but I’m not too into their designs either.
 I’m looking for this kind of lace design: https://imgur.com/a/QgTQRXQ

                              <span>I’m an American in nyc and my partner and I are going to vietnam and Thailand in a couple months and I will be meeting his family for the first time. He is from Vietnam and saw my leg shaking while we were watching a movie. He said I can’t do that in vietnam because it’s bad luck. Are there any other subtle social faux pas that are different than the usa? What do I say when someone sneezes?

                              <span>I see my options are:
  
1h flight direct / 3h with layover.
 But I’ve heard there is almost always delays with domestic flights here especially with budget airlines. 
 
11h bus ride. Already done 8 hour Saigon to Da Lat &amp; doing 4 hour Da Lat to Nha Trang tomorrow. 
 
11h train. Not heard much. 
 
 What’s the locals option on doing this? What would be my best option we are with a group of 6. Money isn’t the biggest concern but should be considered. Time definitely more valuable as we are moving place to place every 3 days roughly.

 Perhaps someone on Reddit has already been and knows the specifics?

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I have recently been offered a management job to join a company in Vietnam. The salary they are offering would be 85 million đồng per month plus minor stock options in the business. 
 I current live in the UK (but not in London) and earn around 15% more than this but I believe even living in HCMC, my living expenses in Vietnam would be much less than what I have now.
 Obviously I know that the average person in Vietnam is not earning 85 million / month, but will this be enough for a foreigner to rent a city centre apartment, get a motorbike (or even car?) and live comfortably?

 From the business name you would think this African braider located in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam actually has a shop. She doesn&#x27;t. Mila is located in a tiny apartment she shares with her husband which is accessed through a nail shop.
 We communicated via WhatsApp. Before booking I asked if Mila had a portfolio so I could take a look at her work. I was sent a series of photos and a link to her Facebook account that had more pictures. I chose the style based on the photo on her website that I mistakenly believed was her work. It wasn&#x27;t. It was a photos of hair styles compiled from the internet.
 My services included wash, deep conditioning, blow dry and cornrows with extensions.

 So after being very confused why my Vietnamese friend was saying words that end in “oc” as “op,” I decided to do some research. Apparently, in Vietnamese, you have to close your mouth for certain ending constants, so a word ending in ung would sound like “ungm.”
 My question to you guys is how say it. I remember teaching my friends how to properly pronounce the Spanish “t” by placing the tips of their tongues on the top part of the back of their teeth. I realize this question is kind of technical, but everything I’ve looked up doesn’t really address it or attributes it to an different accent or dialect (but both Northerners and Southerners do this from my knowledge).
 Any advice? Many thanks! Cảm ơn!
 I also tagged this as discussion since I can’t seem to get a clear answer on how to do this lingual maneuver.

 Can anyone recommend any high quality salons with good hairstylists who can do this? I’m located in Quận 8, but willing to travel to city center if needed.
 Thanks!

                              <span>My girlfriend and I rented an Airbnb for a couple weeks in Hanoi and the host messaged us last night, two days before our arrival, claiming something was wrong with the room so it wouldn’t be available at least the first few days and offered us a much lower cost hotel room he owns instead. This was followed by a bunch of offers to sell us Ha Long Bay tours. I realized he was trying a bait and switch scam on us so we canceled the reservation promptly. Has anyone else dealt with something like this?

 I&#x27;m currently doing research on the impact of venereal disease during the American War. I&#x27;m looking for any Vietnamese sources relating to this (that are either digitised or could be sent to me online, as I am carrying out this research in the UK). There&#x27;s one in particular I&#x27;d love to know more about: Mai dam: Mot te doan? nghe nghiep? Hinh thuc no le? (apologies for lack of tone marks I don&#x27;t have the keyboard on this laptop) 
 Alternatively, if any body knows anyone who might be willing to do an oral interview with me on this sensitive topic, that would be extremely helpful. Please feel free to reach out via message! 
 Cảm ơn!

                              <span>Chào các bạn,
 My fiance and I (US) are getting married this year and are doing a reception in the U.S. and in Viet Nam with my side of the family who are in Viet Nam. It will be a small affair, of about 25-30 people max, total. Does anyone know of any venues in Saigon that could host this, and/or estimates as to how much an event like this my cost? I read some anecdotes of a low key reception of 50 people costing $1k that included food, MC, music. 
 Honestly any information or experience or advice you would have would be so helpful and much appreciated. I don&#x27;t even know where to start looking, lol. Cảm ơn nhiều!

                              <span>Having lived here for going on four years I&#x27;m constantly amazed that I do not see a vehicular collision every day, given the chaos and rule breaking observed on the roads.
 That said last week an old geezer rear ended my PCX on his 25 year old Wave, or whatever it was.
 Pretty sure he&#x27;d been at the Bia Hoi, and 99% sure his vision wasn&#x27;t 20/20. Add in that it happened at night.
 It&#x27;s said that Thailand is the second most dangerous country in the world re. traffic accidents and fatalities.
 Where does Vietnam fit into the picture re. the aforementioned?
 I drive really slowly, be it in the city or on the bigger roads. Seems that&#x27;s the key. A colleague said to me he treats everyone as a drunk driver looking at their phone.
 Then you have the buffalo boys who hoon around town, helmetless. Surely these guys don&#x27;t last long?
 Interested in what you&#x27;ve seen/been involved in/heard re. the madness that is Vietnamese traffic.
 *Note: not shitting on Vietnam, just want some feedback. For me, traffic and dodgy bosses are the least pleasant aspect of living here. They are balanced out, or outweighed by the positives.
