                              <span>Hi,
 I am considering doing the ha giang loop on the back of an easy rider on my upcoming trip. Two main concerns I have are:
  
Is the weather in the region suitable for the tour during August?
 
I asked the tour guide people if a 130kg (im a big guy) person would be suitable to ride on these bikes with an easy rider, and they said “130 should be fine”
 
 Should?!
 I fully understand if I’m not able to go but that kind of animosity scares me haha. Should I ask again? is it too risky? 
 I would appreciate responses, thank you!!

                              <span>I want to move through Vietnam a ethically as possible. I know from my time in Tanzania that local-owned guesthouses struggled to compete with Airbnb which were owned mostly by non-locals. Does anyone have any advice about this? Hostels look pretty good from what I&#x27;ve seen.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve lived in Vietnam for a while and a pescatsrian friend is coming over for the first time. I want to show her some of my favourites like bun cha, bun bo, pho, bo kho, etc. - but obviously she can&#x27;t eat them due to her diet.
 Is there anywhere that does vegetarian twists on these Vietnamese classics?
 Aslo open to suggestions for good veggie friendly restaurants or dishes that can be found anywhere.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>This is mostly aimed at people living in Hanoi and the surrounding provinces. 
 As some of you may know, there is a power shortage that will continue throughout June. The official word is that power cuts will be occuring daily due to &quot;El Nino&quot;. 
 Over the past week or so, my district (Long Bien) has experienced 5 outages that last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours at a time. We&#x27;re told about them in the morning, so there isn&#x27;t much time to plan around them as they start at 8 AM. 
 Tonight, we&#x27;ve been told (officially) that the outages will occur each day for the next month. In my 9 years living in Hanoi, I&#x27;ve never experienced this before, yes, occasionally power will cut during a typhoon, but never like this. 
 Does anyone else who is currently going through this have a backup generator? Is it worth investing in one? My wife and I run our business from home and we need to be online 24/7. We can&#x27;t be out of the house for too long as we have 2 dogs that only pee outside and our son comes home for lunch and a nap each day. 
 Need advice on how to deal with it. Can&#x27;t move because we own our property. Should I buy a generator? Have you heard any information about the power cuts that might shed more light than our building&#x27;s manager has already? Do you know someone who works in the energy sector that has mentioned it to you? Feeling absolutely helpess RN.

                              <span>I saw an estimate of the percentage of Catholics in Vietnam and, it says it&#x27;s about 7%. Is it right? But talking about some beliefs, they say that Our Lady made an apparition in La Vang 17/August/1798, what I particularly believe, as a Catholic. I&#x27;m not here to discuss religion itself, but I&#x27;d like to know your thoughts on that and, if someone has a picture/statue/icon, a photo of it (please 😀)

 Was looking to get some good hostel recommendations in each of these cities. Chill or Party vibes will be preferred, if there&#x27;s anything like that xD

 I&#x27;ll be going to places where there will be a good amount of mosquitos soon I believe (Nin Binh, Cat Ba island, Phong Nha,)
 Do you guys suggest DEET for non clothed skin ((eg; face, hands, etc) and Pemethrin to put on top of clothing (shirt, pants , etc)? If so, what barands also sell Pemethrin ?

                              <span>Hi All, we are a mixed couple and just found out we are moving to HCMC. We are into nightlife, we party, close daytime social areas to meet people, make new friends, hit the gym, convenient parks to walk the dogs, prefer near waterfront with a water view, good mix of Việt and foreigners. Where do we look to live? We currently live in Hanoi on the lake, next to a park, lots of people gather and meet. We would love something similar. Places we have seen on listing that intrique us: Icon 56 building D2 Sanwah Pearl Golden River looks nice but no dogs. Suggestions welcome
 We want a mix of social, access to everything we want to buy, not overpriced but we aren&#x27;t cheap, unique, where we can easily meet like singles and couples.

Is that right or am I missing something? Could a friend locally get a ‘top up’ receipt for my number that I could punch in with the SIM in my phone while being abroad?

                              <span>My wife and I are super excited to be having our first child soon, but we’ve been trying to figure out where to go for the birth. Nghe nói bệnh viện từ dũ rất tốt, nhưng k biết là mình tin được cái hype đó không? Is it just hype? Or actually good? Có khi nào nó nổi tiếng to the point it will be too crowded and we won’t have a room when we show up? Any better alternatives? Thanks guys

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I was wondering if anyone would be able to share any resources or guides for medical terminology in Vietnamese? I was working at a clinic and got lost with the word &quot;glaucoma.&quot; Alternatively, I would to practice my Vietnamese with a partner if anyone is interested! I grew up speaking some Vietnamese but am really hoping to become more fluent.

                              <span>For context: I&#x27;m a tourist and I speak zero Vietnamese; I try to use Google translate to my advantage and it&#x27;s worked surprisingly well so far. 
 I&#x27;m trying to look for a tattoo shop that offers somewhat reasonably priced services. I&#x27;ve been offered around 200 USD for 12*9cm minimalist designs. 
 Do you guys have any other shops to recommend?

                              <span>I recently got my visa approved for Vietnam and when I applied I listed Ho Chi Minh City as where I will be departing from because my very loose plan is to start in Hanoi and make my way down south before going to Cambodia. However, there is a chance I will stay in the north and then go to Laos and Thailand. So, right now all I have is my one way plane ticket to Hanoi. Do I need to show proof of a departing flight when arriving in Vietnam? The last time I was in Vietnam I did have a departing flight but I don&#x27;t remember what the protocol was/if they checked it. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be doing a 3-week travel to Vietnam from south to north. 
 Major locations: HCMC, Mékong Delta, Hoi An, Ninh Binh, Ha Long Bay, Ba Be park, Bao Lac, Meo Vac, Quan Ba, others in the north, Hanoi.
 I am not sure whether to take malaria tablets. I am rather risk averse when it comes to health. Could you please advise on this? 
 Thanks!

 Any hidden gems or places to go to? Even if its a closeby province it should be alright

                              <span>Hi there, I’ve been travelling for the past few months and the one thing I miss a lot is playing ps5 with the homies. I have a friend that met me in Vietnam to do a bike trip from Hanoi to Saigon within 3 weeks and was wondering if there are places that we would be able to go to in Vietnam that have games like NHL or smite to play. Thanks in advance for any information.

They were all talking about how they rent apartments here for peanuts, and simply eat Bahn Mis and plow fresh young Vietnamese chicks on the daily.
 One guy buys like 100 pills of viagra and uses them all in under two months. He’s a lawyer and just has a broker who sends him up fresh meat multiple times a day.
 To be honest, it was kind of repulsive to hear about all this. I’ve been having a great time with the locals and it’s kind of nuts how all these women are getting used and abused by westerners. What do local Vietnamese think about this? They seem to be happy with throwing their daughters to the viagra popping wolves of the west.

                              <span>Hey I’m new to Vietnam and I’ll be staying here a couple of weeks. Is there anybody who would like to meet up and play some chess in one of the many coffee shops / bars?
 My ELO on chess.com is around 1600 rapid, but currently feeling like 1000 because of jet-lag.

                              <span>Family of 4 just finished an amazing trip in Hanoi. For context : African-American, M (52yo), F(52), twins M(18) and F(18). We were stopped on numerous occasions and asked to take pictures - in Hanoi, in the terminal and on the ferry from Halong Bay, in particular. There was a language barrier so I wasn’t able to ascertain from the requesters as to why. When I asked those who did speak English, no one had an explanation. Can you help me?

                              <span>Bối cảnh rằng tôi là nhân viên mặt đất của một hãng hàng không trong nước V… khoảng 4 năm cho đến giờ. Tôi cũng đã có một mối tình 7 năm với vợ mình từ những năm đầu khi còn học đại học, chúng tôi cưới nhau 2 năm rưỡi từ trước dịch covid19, và chưa có con.
 Mọi thứ cứ trôi qua êm đẹp như vậy, đi làm kiếm tiền như bao người. Cho đến khi vợ tôi nghỉ công tác tại ngân hàng M… Việc này làm tôi khá khủng hoảng về tinh thần khi làm ca kíp về và liên tục bị trì triết, phàn nàn về nhiều thứ. Và vợ tự sinh ra cái suy nghĩ nghỉ làm thành gánh nặng của tôi, mặc dù tôi cũng rất tán thành việc nghỉ nếu công việc quá áp lực và không hiệu quả về kinh tế. 
 Tôi chả biết do nghiệp hay duyên làm tôi có quen được 1 chị tiếp viên hơn tôi 3 tuổi vào đúng thời gian này. Không ai chủ động, chỉ nói chuyện về công việc rồi chia sẻ về cuộc sống, dần rà sau 1 tháng điều gì đến sẽ đến. Vâng, tôi có cãi nhau với vợ và rủ chị kia đi Hạ Long chơi và có qhtd. Ban đầu mục đích của tôi chỉ là giải toả căng thẳng, bằng một cách thần cmn kỳ xong chị ta yêu tôi. Rồi ngày qua ngày, việc chị ta cứ chia sẻ công việc (cùng ngành) mua đồ, quan tâm đến tôi cũng làm tôi có chút rung động :)
 Thực sự việc này tôi đã biết là sai ngay từ lúc rủ chị ta đi Hạ Long, tôi cũng vẫn rất yêu vợ mình chứ. Nhưng bản tính tham lam và râm tục của tôi làm tôi vẫn muốn giữ mối quan hệ này :( Chị ta cũng biết tôi có vợ và vẫn chấp nhận làm người thứ 3… Sau khi chia sẻ những lời này thì tôi vẫn đang có một gia đình đáng yêu và vẫn duy trì mqh ngoài luồng. Tôi sai rồi!!

                              <span>My parents and the older generation of my family, those who immigrated to the US, have always said that American and Western foods are always too salty or too sweet. They always say that too much salt or sugar is used. They also say this is why American food is so unhealthy.
 I’ve mainly been raised up in the US and eat both Asian and Western cuisines but never found this to be true. I’ve always found most foods to be reasonably seasoned to my tastes. I’ve asked friends and family around my age, and they also generally agree with me. I also believe the whole “American food is unhealthy” myth to be untrue because that really only applies to fast food which you really don’t eat on a daily basis. It’s also a huge over generalization of American cuisine considering how diverse each region and state is. I digress though. Is it really true that Vietnamese/Asian cuisine use less salt/sugar and are healthier than American/Western cuisine, or is this more of a subjective to taste thing?

                              <span>I’m returning to Vietnam from Australia next week! Last year I spent a month travelling your beautiful country, but this time I’m spending 2 weeks in Saigon. 
 I’m looking to see if there is any sort of Hip Hop scene in Saigon? Have it be gigs, shops, painters, dancers, rappers and singer, anything really. I’m a street artist here in Australia and found a bit of a scene last year in Hanoi, so surely there is something going in in Saigon. 
 Also, looking to go and see some good live music, both traditional and if there is any contemporary gigs. I’ve found the opera which will be great to go to. But I’m open to anything really! Also if there is any race scene at all? I’ve found a few clubs that have potential like Arcan. 
 Thanks in advanced everyone. I’m so excited to be back in Vietnam next week!!!

                              <span>A few days ago I went to a massage parlor (which clearly advertises happy endings) and the staff was extremely friendly, like they knew how to talk to foreigners and banter with them.
 I actually got along really well with my girl, and we talked quite a bit (a lot of it using google translate). After everything was said and done, I was gathering my belongings, I asked her what she recommended I do for fun in Hanoi. On google translate she said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I only stay here&quot; and she had kind of a weird look on her face.
 It was kind of strange, like she just looked at me for a moment, the continued dressing me. 
 What do you think that meant?

 ​
 I would like to know the general opinion on VinU and whether I should consider it.

 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all! I am an Indian trying to move to Vietnam for work. I got an offer at a Vietnamese company and plan on moving in July 2023 for long stay. How difficult is the visa process? Are their any contractual restrictions? How do the work laws function in Vietnam for foreigners? 
 Thanks in advance!

 I was already in a bad mood so I told him to cancel my room and booked next door. 
 Is it still legal tender or is it basically redundant now? 
 Can I change it at a bank (I’m a tourist and don’t have an account)?

                              <span>Hi everyone! :) Basically, I&#x27;m creating this ARG (alternate reality game) and in it, I&#x27;m trying to create this Vietnamese person who is essentially the main character. Mainly I need help with the name. I&#x27;m trying to come up with a name that would utilize the Vietnamese word for descent; the name would be made by splitting up the word into syllables that could then be used to create a full name (ex: like the word danger being used to create the name daniel criminger). Unfortunately, I do not know a lick of Vietnamese. 
 I&#x27;m struggling with two things: 
 A) I&#x27;d like to be able to find a correct translation of the Vietnamese word for descent. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of websites including Google Translate and ChatGPT and they all come up with different answers and 
 B) I&#x27;d like to be able to come up with a realistic name, something that actually sounds believable, if that makes sense. I&#x27;m sorry if it&#x27;s a large request but any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

                              <span>Xin chào, mình là sinh viên năm nhất và đang tham gia vào 1 tổ chức bên ngoài trường Đh. Lúc mới vào năm nhất kiểu bị cú sốc đầu đời á mng, ai ai cũng apply vô clb này clb nọ, các clb thì quảng bá lợi ích đẹp cv các thứ, thế là mình cũng apply vô. Thế nhưng dạo gần đây mình lại thấy khá chênh vênh, mình đang không thực sự hiểu mình đang làm gì. Những thứ mình hiện đang làm có thực sự nâng cấp bản thân của mình ? Những mối quan hệ vô trong tổ chức này mình quen có thực sự đáng giá ? Nếu mình không tham gia thì liệu mình có tốt hơn ? Mình không biết. Mình hiện tại cứ có suy nghĩ rằng ráng tham gia hết năm 2 đi, cho có cái để trải nghiệm, cho có cái để viết vào cv, nhưng mình cũng nghĩ là liệu nhà tuyển dụng có thật sự quan tâm ? Mình không biết nên out hay ở ... Hãy cho mình xin lời khuyên.

 Now, I’m trying to book hotels, and I want a very nice 4 or 5 star hotel in a modern area of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. 
 I’m looking for hotels similar to jw Marriott (Hanoi), they’re fully booked for my dates so any similar will do. And if anyone can recommend me anything for Ho Chi Minh I’d be grateful! 
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey guys,
 My wife’s bà nội died suddenly, we won’t be able to make it to Vietnam in time for the funeral. 
 She’s already burned some incense at our tiny shrine. But she’s not practising and does this stuff more out of habit than anything else.
 What could I do on the day of the funeral to mark my respect? I was thinking to print a picture of her and get a small bouquet of white lilies and putting them on the shrine. Is that appropriate?

 there is a big vietnamese shopping center in berlin germany. A few years ago i got myself a vietnamese pastry after a vietnamese frien recommended it.
 it was sweet and i guessed made with rice flour so kinda like mochi but really big, hand sized. it was wrapped in a bananaleaf, went there twice after that encounter got somethings i thought that were like that but it was both times bitter and not what i wanted. Can anyone plese tell me the name?

                              <span>Hey All. I am very new to this sub because I am considering taking a job in Vietnam with my almost 3 year old son. The job will pay for his schooling/childcare. I have a master&#x27;s in teaching English, and am looking to work in another country already. 
 A few thoughts I have are the quality of childcare, the quality of life, and what are your opinions in regards to the activites/culture in general. With so much respect to Vitetnam, I ask this with cost/life analysis perspective in mind-- how are things there? 
 *I am American by the way :)

 We don&#x27;t need them to get there quickly, cost and reliability is more important than speed. 
 We are in Hanoi Old Quarter.

                              <span>Hi,
 Me and my boyfriend are looking to go to Vietnam for 2 weeks this year from the UK last week in October &amp; first week in November.
 Is it better for us to go to North or South Vietnam? We usually walk a lot on holidays and we’d ideally like good weather, but not sure where would be best to go

I’ve found a few shops but they all seem to sell new acoustic stock. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Context: first gen 22F viet-American. 
 EDIT: Some people are asking how this relates to r/vietnam, I just wanted some more Việt Kiều/mainlander perspectives to see if there’s something I’m missing in navigating this mess. 
 We had seen the first one together and they enjoyed it, so I thought they might like this. But they clearly didn’t, and even talked badly about it during the movie. EDIT: It was too artsy and chaotic for them. Too much going on.
 It’s okay if they didn’t like it since we are worlds apart when it comes to media consumption. I just hate that they didn’t at least stay and experience the movie with me and my brother. It had been a while since we had gone out to the movie theaters as a family.
 To make it worse, my brother is very hot tempered and told them to shut up several times while they were critiquing the movie, and even as they were walking out. I get where his frustration is coming from, but I don’t agree with how disrespectful he was. 
 They waited for us outside in the car. On the ride home, I tried to keep the conversation light even if I was slightly annoyed. 
 But the tension was clear. And when they confronted my brother about snapping at them, they all started yelling at each other. 
 We just got home and there was a lot of door slamming. I feel really sad. If I had known the evening would end this way, I would have just gone to see the movie myself.

                              <span>Hello! 👋 My boyfriend and I are working on applying to jobs in Vietnam, starting this week. Before we do this, we are sorting out our CVs and cover letters.
 I am a qualified English teacher with a 4-year Education degree specializing in English language. I have 6 years of experience in the industry.
 My boyfriend is a graphic designer and photographer and holds a 3-year bachelor degree in the above field, he has a 180-hour TEFL course certification and has 7 years experience. 
 He is designing our CVs from scratch, to suit our specific aesthetic wants. I have some questions regarding what Vietnamese schools might look for in a CV/what is considered professional:
 • He is holding a chihuahua in his head shot, it is a professional and very striking photo. Would this be considered strange to a Vietnamese recruiter?
 • My CV is working with a colour palette of pink and grey, are there better colours I could choose that recruiters might find more appealing or make my CV stand out more?
 • What are some specific categories in CVs that recruiters look at?
 • Is there any way we can strengthen our chances/make our CVs stand out from the rest?
 Thank you so much, this subreddit is a godsend.

 Sex outside marriage with a local is illegal in Vietnam. How is the law enforced? If you live in an upscale apartment with security and bring a guest. . . they try to stop you? Notify the police? Blackmail you with the entrance camara footage????
 Porn is illegal in Vietnam. How do they even enforce that? Customs confiscates your devices for a thorough inspection? The government tracks your internet activity?

                              <span>Hello, we live in US and want to get married in Vietnam(I am originally from Vietnam). We are in process of finalizing our wedding location. Assuming guests can make it, what is recommended location for December wedding? 
  
Cost: Will the wedding cost similar at both locations? Assuming similar type of venue and decoration. 
 
Weather: preferably we want outdoor wedding. From our initial search, it may rain in DaNang in December? 
 
Venue availability in December: DaNang seem to be busy with tourists during December 
 
 Main reason for considering DaNang/ Hoi An is half of the guests are non Vietnamese and these locations are unique to Vietnam. Since they are traveling to Vietnam, and may not travel again in future DaNang/ Hoi An has more cultural and tourist things todo. We might be wrong, but we don’t see something similar in or nearby Ho Chi Minh City. We would like your opinion/ suggestions.

                              <span>i’m preparing to travel back to vietnam for the first time soon. i was born there but moved to canada as a child, and then paris, so i’ve been surrounded by french culture almost more than my own. now that i finally got the chance to come back to vietnam, i’ve grown curious to know if there are any remnants of french culture there from colonial times. besides the obvious ones like banh mi, coffee, pho, and architecture, are there any french influences present in everyday life in VN? and what do modern viet people think of french culture, if at all?

                              <span>Hello, everyone!
 I plan to move to Vietnam in october and I&#x27;m having trouble to find out if my medicine exists in Vietnam. I need to take these four meds:
 Olanzapine
 Venlafaxine
 Wellbutrin (bupropion)
 Zargus (Risperidon)
 Does anyone here knows if they exist / how to buy them in Vietnam? And anyone else with borderline personality disorder would like to share their experience about moving to Vietnam?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi guys, I am planning to do the Ha Giang loop in the first week of september. How is the situation there regarding tourists? Is it crowded during this month and will i get a place to sleep when im riding on my own without a tourguide? If the streets and view spots are too crowded i would reconsider taking the trip.. Any advice would really be appreciated :)

                              <span>Hey guys, I know its not morning but the title was right there and I had to do it 😂
 I&#x27;m travelling through vietnam right now and I was looking for advice from some viet natives. I am solo travelling and just can&#x27;t seem to meet people and have remotely lengthy conversations. I keep trying but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. I&#x27;m currently in hanoi (old quarter). I&#x27;ve been walking around all day, searching online and trying to find events or language exchange communities. Looking online everyone seems to be saying its super easy to meet people here so I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m struggling. I am usually very confident talking to people back home, but it seems this language barrier is impeding me more than others.
 Any advice would be much appreciated as I&#x27;m a very social person and tend to be far happier when with people.

                              <span>Hi folks! Anyone here got good experience with therapy in Vietnam? I&#x27;m looking for recommendations of someone who&#x27;s preferably speak English and psychoanalytically trained. 
 Also is 1M the usual fee in Vietnam per session? Would therapists ever offer, idk, like a combo price or something? It just doesn&#x27;t seem very proportionate to the average wage here. 
 Thanks in advance!

 These days i really miss banh mi sandwich but there are no places to have original, legit, authentic banh mi. So I ordered this ham to make it at home. What’s the difference? Gio lua and cha chien
 Q.2 
 I prepared 
 Baguette 
 Cucumber Cilantro Pickled Carrot/radish
 Vietnamese Ham 
 Cholimex hot sauce / mayo/ butter 
 Can you recommend me some ingredients to make better banh mi? Is this basic ingredient rigth? 
 What is the genuine banh mi recipe? I googled it and searched it on YouTubed but it seems complicated than original one 🤔

                              <span>Hello.
 I am looking for a way to travel from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi by bus.
 I searched for buses on google through baolau, vexere, and sinhtourist, but none of them go directly from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi.
 The only way I can find is to get off in Da Nang or Hue and then book a new ticket.
 I&#x27;ve seen information that Mailinh Express runs this route, but when I look it up on their website, it says there are no buses.
 Can someone tell me how to get from Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi directly without any transfers?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Flying into Hanoi, then doing Halong Bay, then spending time in Hue. Looking at the weather it says thunderstorms everyday throughout every place we are going, how much of the day will be raining? Are they passing showers or all day affairs? Rain doesn’t bother me.. just curious. Any recommendations for things to do in Hanoi or Hue?

                              <span>Hello guys , I’m 21 i’m a vietnamese/black American, i been to vietnam twice when i was younger , and recently about 2 months ago. I loved the trip made me very close with the culture , i received so much love in Vietnam , why i make this post is because i want to actually move there but not sure what to expect , Im not very fluent in vietnamese but i do have knowledge and can hold a conversation in some ways , Im currently studying more with my uncles that speak vietnamese and english as they are teaching me more etc. What would you guys say i should expect committing to living in Vietnam (Mostly South VN). What is the price to live , obtain citizenship , or even a 5 year visa? I do have a small support system due to my mom growing up in a village , friends .
 1- What should I expect? 
 2-How hard it is to find a job if i’m not very fluent , i know the basics (numbers , food , little bit conversation)
 3-How will citizenship work for me if i want to obtain ? Both my parents are from VN my father doesn’t have his citizenship paper , but mother does. 
 4-How much is rent in certain district ?
 5-What is a good amount of USD to start a life in vietnam?
 6- I plan on moving there in 2025
 7- What areas would a foreigner like myself with my background should be a good start?

                              <span>Hi all!
 Currently in HCMC City. I was wondering if there are low alcohol beers (2-4%) here, besides Heineken Silver?
 Thanks for your suggestions!

                              <span>Just to make things clear I have nothing against gyms frequented by locals. I am currently attending one but because I can’t speak Vietnamese I feel like I’m slowing everyone else down and they have to put a lot of effort into accommodating me. It’s made things a little difficult.
 If anyone knows of any gyms where expats go or are used to training expats that would be great.
 Im also open to regular boxing. So if anyone knows any good expat gyms that do that too, I&#x27;d love to hear it

  Also, my roof has been leaking. I have a bucket to collect most of the water, but I need to empty it and mop the floor every time it rains. I&#x27;ve been asking them to fix it for a month or reduce my rent but now I just want to leave. 
 I pay too much for this to be my reality. I only moved here because it was pet friendly, but my cat died 2 months ago. I&#x27;m off work for one month and would like to move while I have time, but they will not break my contact without keeping my security deposit, even if I feel the spirit of my contract is broken. How do I break the lease and get my money back so I can move? Am I shit out of luck? Cheers thanks.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;ve heard that the installlation fee, maintenance fee, operation fee of having Air Conditioners (AC) in some western countries costs an arm and leg. And people in some countries in Europe don&#x27;t have AC at home, according to some of my friends in France, Spain and UK.
 Sales of portable air-conditioning units rose 2,420 percent in a week, British retailer Sainsbury’s said during the hot season last year. Some in Europe are coming to accept that some AC usage may be needed to save lives. After a heat wave killed an estimated 15,000 people in France in 2003, air conditioning was introduced to some nursing homes in a bid to protect the most vulnerable. 
 How do you guys feel about AC in Vietnam, where the prices are cheap and almost every household in urban cities like Hanoi or Saigon has at least one. AC in hot nation like Vietnam is true love or a threat to the environment?

                              <span>My Vietnamese passport expired a few years ago and I want to renew it. I looked it up on the NY consulate website and it looks like for expired passport renewal you basically have to apply for a new one. But the forms for that asks a lot about pre-immigration life such as where I lived, why I left, any and all relative information including their addresses, etc. And I don’t have all this information since I moved here when I was super young and I don’t know all my relatives especially their Vietnamese names and addresses. More importantly the forms are all in Vietnamese so I’m assuming I’d have to answer in Vietnamese but I don’t speak/read/write Vietnamese. I’ve tried calling the NY consulate but haven’t gotten through to them. Looking for any advice to make this process easier

                              <span>I am vietnamese but have been in the states for 15 years. I havent been back. I am travelling to HCM and Hanoi with my partner in couple of weeks. We are comfortable with ourselves in term of PDA in cities in the states, but I am afraid we would be stared and verbally attacked. I do speak the language so the shaming may scare me. 
 My partner is from Hungary and we received that treatment when we visited the country. I do want to show him the beauty and food culture in Vietnam, yet not wanting to run into any trouble just because we are both men.

                              <span>Hi. Saturday morning we arrive in Hanoi airport. We need to transfer to our hotel in Tam Coc. Hotel has quoted us a private SUV at a cost of 1.500k. Is that reasonable? The other thing I was wondering was whether I could just book a grab from the airport to our hotel in Tam Coc or is that going to be a trip most won&#x27;t take?
 ​
 Thanks.

I assume the more reputable/expensive it is like 5 star buffets, the more safe it is. But I&#x27;m daring to try &#x27;cheaper&#x27; buffets, althought it might not be wise?

 So..is this really convincing fake meat or something more like vegetarian-fed pork? 
 Google translate didn’t clear things up much 😅

                              <span>I mean this respectfully but I am curious. Having spent a month in North Vietnam we saw a large number of villagers and tribespeople burning all their waste, filling the air with noxious plastic fumes. Is there no waste collection service in these areas? It was so sad to see the beautiful landscape blurred by the fumes of burning waste. Why does this happen?

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m currently looking for a teaching job in Vietnam, i sent my application to some centers though while waiting i wanted to try applying for jobs on Facebook groups yet i felt like it could be risky. 
 Most offers there are &quot;some locals&quot; looking for teachers and not actual schools/centers, it seemed not legit to me but what i know is that everything works differently in Vietnam, right? 
 My question is, how legit are those offers? Is there anyone here that was hired this way through a local on facebook? 
 I would appreciate your help.

                              <span>I am On a train right now in Vietnam, not going to say where from and to but it’s a long journey. The train officer (man with hat and blue uniform) came to my cabin (I am with a friend in the first class 4 berth cabin) and showed me a translation on his phone saying there will be people coming to our cabin next stop, and he can transfer them to another cabin so we can stay alone if I pay him 450,000 Dong. I payed him. Scam or real?

 In most of the south east Asian countries, Honda is usually more popular than Mazda. But here in Vietnam, seemingly Honda is not so popular. Does anyone know the reason?

                              <span>Hi hope someone can help me out. I want to buy 2 tickets for the Sanna Khanh Hoa vs Viettel match on June the 6th. Do I just go to the stadium and buy them there? I’m from UK so not sure how it works. Thanks

                              <span>I(living in Japan) am planning to visit the home of my Vietnamese friend. I would like to bring souvenirs for their children, and I&#x27;m wondering what items would make them happy. The children are a high school girl, an 8-year-old boy, and a 5-year-old boy. There is no budget limitation.
 I guess some fancy fountain pens could be good. Any suggestions? Thank you.

                              <span>How much is the daily cost of living of an average single person living in the city side of Vietnam?
 Additional info:
 I do not intend to live yet to any country But I&#x27;m interested in GENERAL on how people live their lives as average people
 So a diverse answer is okay. Whenever you live in any city
 You can also give your personal range of cost of living as a person living by himself/herself
 I want to know or to be as grounded as possible on how natives live their life every day

I was wondering if i could buy some in any recommended pharmacies around District 1. I have a prescription note from my country’s psychiatrist, but will it work if i were to buy some here? I really need it for my anxiety.

 It’ll be one (25g) package only, amongst other personal stuff. It’ll be sent with dhl. It’ll be tobacco, not cigars or cigarettes.
 I read it’s allowed to import up to 250g but, it doesn’t say if that is allowed as well as a postal item. Experiences please?

                              <span>I have a Vietnamese girlfriend (in the United States).
 If I get serious with her, there are a few things I will want to discuss.
 One of them is her views on spanking children.
 Do most Vietnamese mothers spank?
 Growing up in the United States, it was one of those things that was usually considered private and only discussed with close friends so I honestly cannot even give an answer for how common it is in The United States (perhaps she will have a similar honest answer).
 In the United States, I would say that it about half and half (but that is only from my experience).

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m planning a journey for myself and husband. We&#x27;re first-time travellers to Vietnam this year in late August / early September. Any tips for off the beaten track tours of 1 or 2 days on the Mekong Delta? We&#x27;re used to road-trips and bumping into authentic experiences with people, a local guide in this case will probably give us insights we wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have. I found something by Innoviet and Local-insider, but I still don&#x27;t know if that is what we&#x27;re looking for. Any tips will be much appreciated.

                              <span>I always find it strange that Vietnam used Latin, Well until I found out missionaries helped make a functional writing system for the Vietnamese language. But even then, there doesn’t seem to be a push for the original script as I visited there before. I can only assume is for convenience. Since learning thousands of characters isn’t the most fun for the illiterate populace who farm all day. But since it’s the modern time. I can imagine someone would be interested in re learning a dead writing system essentially

                              <span>Hi Viet-redditers,
 Probably a long shot 
 I&#x27;m trying to find back a restaurant that I just loved when I was here the last time in 2018.
 It was right in front of the Lapis hotel on Tran Hung Dao (the avenue with all the embassies). Best banh xeo I&#x27;ve ever had + a bunch of other worthy dishes.
 Unexplainably now they put a fake teppanyaki fusion restaurant instead.
 I asked the girl at the entrance and she told me it might have moved to Le Duan Street - but I&#x27;m not sure if she actually understood that I was looking for that specific restaurant.
 Does anybody here know the name? 
 If not I&#x27;ll take other good banh xeo suggestions too (in Hanoi)
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi Viet Nam!
 Over the last year or two, I&#x27;ve been coming across articles about how major smartphone manufacturers have been increasingly shifting operations towards India and Viet Nam.
 As you know, China has been pretty much the &quot;factory of the world&quot; over the last 2 decades and her socioeconomic transformation has been astounding over the same period to say the least. Sadly, I was too young to pay attention then.
 Because of a rapidly aging population and diminishing workforce, cost of labour in China has risen exponentially. Coupled with constant, multi-front geopolitical tensions, one can understand why having operations in China faces a diminishing risk-reward ratio.
 Looking at Vietnam&#x27;s Balance of Trade, I see that it&#x27;s surged post-2015, around the time the protectionist Trump administration got elected - which I suppose accelerated the trend of de-coupling from China. However, the Vietnamese Dong seems to be facing a constant weakening, unlike that of an export hub. Somehow, I never see reports about how these winds are affecting regular Vietnamese citizens.
 Have you noticed a surge in manufacturing activity in Viet Nam?
 If so, how has this impacted you? 
 Has the surge been driven by MNCs setting up their own plants, or have they been subcontracting to local manufacturers?
 Also, have these factories been concentrated in particular regions and therefore limited in benefit?
 Do you think Viet Nam will experience the same breakneck growth in the next decade as China did?
 I&#x27;m excited to hear the perspectives of people living through the change!

                              <span>There is a beach festival is going on now in Nha Trang. It&#x27;s suppose to start on the 3rd of June (according to the receptionist), but they have already practicing from the 30th of May. I don&#x27;t mind the noise if it&#x27;s until 22:00, heck even 00:00 is fine. But it&#x27;s 01:50 AM and those motherfuckers are still singing and blasting EXTREMELY LOUD music. Nobody was able to sleep. Many tourists and visitors are staying near the beach, around the area. There are many hotels. Many have toddlers that need to sleep early. Many have tours that start as early as 7am-8am in the morning.
 Tried to call the police for the noise pollution and they&#x27;re useless. &quot;Oops we can&#x27;t do anything uwu&quot; 😑. Heard a similar situation happened in Nha Trang during Tet as well. Is this only in Nha Trang specifically or does it occurred in other cities in Vietnam as well? 
 Update: The Khanh Hoa province posted this news today in the 31st of May, to remind everyone about the laws and rules.
 https://khanhhoa.gov.vn/vi/tin-tuc-noi-bat/phong-chong-vi-pham-phap-luat-trong-hoat-dong-van-hoa-the-thao-va-du-lich-3005
 Noise pollution is illegal in Vietnam and organisers have to follow the laws created by the Vietnam government. If laws are broken and not being followed, expecting some fine.
 &quot;Kết quả, Thanh tra Bộ Văn hóa, Thể thao và Du lịch đã xử phạt vi phạm hành chính đối với 5 tổ chức, cá nhân có hành vi vi phạm với tổng số tiền xử phạt 340.000.000 đồng.&quot;

                              <span>I’ve got a month off in August/September, flying in and out of HCMC. This will be my first time in South East Asia, so I’m looking for some recommendations for some less touristy places to see. I prefer nature activities, hiking, historical landmarks, temples etc over cities and urban areas. Would love to be able to do some hiking, and I’m also looking into the Ha Giang loop, but otherwise very open to suggestions.

                              <span>I know. Is a difficult topic. But I just need to understand. I’m Argentinian grown up in Italy and living in Spain since 20 years. Basically I’m always a foreign and I know “difficult” people are everywhere.. I’m in Vietnam at the moment and this is being a bit difficult. I always try to smile and Learn the language, at least to say “please” “thanks” “hello” “very good” etc. In HCMC starts with some yelling and pointing fingers and laughing. In Da Lat some being attended with angry looks. In Nha Trang at the bus counter they even don’t want to sell me the tickets for my next destination and turning the face like I wasn’t there… at the hotel, the manager, was asking me if I taken something from the “minibar” ( literally 4 Pepsi cans ) 4 time in a row aggressively and threatening with checking the room…. Should I assume that’s the treatment that I’ll have all around the country? Of course there where people that wanted to help, but at the moment seems they are the minority… and please don’t read this as pointing fingers or in any bad way. As I said I just want to understand. Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone! I´m using the &quot;Assimil&quot; language course book for self study to learn Vietnamese. 
 Yesterday tho, I watched a video about the usage of Vietnamese pronouns by Tieng Viet Oi, which is a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching Vietnamese, and they explained the use of the pronouns in a completely different way than my course book uses them!
 Now I feel insecure and I don´t know, if I should keep on using my course book, because I don´t want to learn this major part of the language in a wrong way! I don´t doubt, that the infos given by Tieng Viet Oi are wrong, because they´re native speakers, but maybe my book uses rules that they left out? I don´t know! Can you native speakers out there tell me, if this use of the pronouns makes any sense, or if my course book isn´t a good source?
 ​
 1.Dialogue:
 Person1, Stranger: calls other cô / Person2, stranger: calls other ông - formal setting
 2.Dialogue
 Person1, waiter: calls other bà / Person2, customer: calls other ông - restaurant order
 3.Dialogue
 Person1, knows other person, not closest friends: calls other anh / Person2, same as other: calls other chi (dot under i) - colloquial talk
 ​
 --&gt; also the book explains the pronouns as:
 -cô: young women or women who aren´t married
 -ông: men older than 40 years
 -bà: elderly women or married women
 -anh/chi(dot): people you know and that are around your age
 ​
 (it doesn´t really consider the relationship between the speaker and the other person!)
 ​
 I´m sorry for the long post! I´d really appreciate any adivce, because I fell in love with the Vietnamese language and I just want to keep on studying! Thanks a lot and have a wonderful day!

                              <span>We have travelled a lot all over the world together, and would do loads of activities during the day, chill on the beach, go for dinner and drinks in the evening. Obviously that has all changed, all of our plans have been cancelled so essentially starting from scratch except for the flights from Europe to Asia. It’s 3 weeks so was planning Hanoi, Chiang Mai, Koh Samui and Hoi An. Honestly my main worry is that I could be days not talking to people and be lonely. I’m introverted as is my partner but we always had each other, we are very friendly but in short conversations normally. I’m a bit lost as to what to do and half considering just not going and losing the money on the flights and maybe doing shorter trips around Europe. From being in a relationship so long it’s almost like you lose confidence alone I think and rely on the other person.

 Recently I ran from Hue to DaNang(100km) in a day for charity. 
 I’m now planning what to do next and am thinking Hanoi to HCMC would be great. 
 Do you know anyone who has done this? If so, I’d love to talk with them about the challenge so I can be as prepared as possible. 
 Id like to raise money for children in need here in Vietnam. What charities do you think need the most support? 
 Does this sound like an event you would like to join or support? If so, message me. The bigger the tribe, the better the vibe. 
 Thanks ya’ll

                              <span>Hi, I am Thai and my husband is Irish. We both have been living in Vietnam for the past 6 years and will move back to Ireland this August. We plan to get a mortgage once we arrive, and one of the documents required from some Irish banks is a foreign credit check. 
 Has anyone ever obtained this from Vietnam? We contacted our banks (Vietcomebank and standard chartered bank) and were told that they could not provide the credit check. Any lead would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I hope this is allowed. My partner and I are planning on moving to Vietnam in 2024 to teach. We’re from South Africa. We are aware that the school year starts around April but we would like to come sooner (Jan/Feb). We are considering volunteering through WorkAway for the first few months before trying to find jobs. We’re wondering how the visa process works: are we still only allowed to stay for 30 days on a tourist visa or is it possible to obtain an extended visa with the help of a host from WorkAway? Or will we have to do visa runs? Because we’re planning on finding jobs while in Vietnam, we’d also like to know what documents we’ll need to apply for jobs and obtain a long stay visa. We’d really appreciate any info and advise! TIA

The most popular ones are Anh Bushcraft and Ana Bushcraft. Does anyone have any backstory on them ? Are these their personal channels or is it the tourism ministry ?

                              <span>Hey everyone! I&#x27;m going to Vietnam soon (I&#x27;m American) to meet my Vietnamese girlfriend&#x27;s family. We&#x27;ve been together for a while and we&#x27;re getting married soon. The thing is, her family might not be too accepting of our relationship because they have super traditional views. Her family matters to her a lot, and I want to give them a good impression (or at least not a horrible one). 
 Any tips or suggestions on how I can approach this? Her family doesn&#x27;t come from wealth, so I was thinking of giving a hundred or so USD dollars to each member of her close family (though I don&#x27;t come from wealth either, a hundred goes a lot further over there than it does in the USA, and I thought it might be a good small amount), a couple nice gifts from America, and then of course showing respect and kindness at all times. 
 But to be honest, I&#x27;m not sure where to go from there. Is there anything I can do to make them really like me despite their traditional views? Or at least even out the scale of hate vs. like haha?

 I’ve got a layover at Ho Chi Minh and my flight has been rescheduled to the next day.
 Am I able to get a visa on arrival ( Australian passport )
 If not are there facilities at the airport?
 I land at 16:00 and my flight has been changed to 07:00am the next day

                              <span>There&#x27;s something strange about food signs all over Vietnam. I mean the signs on the street saying &quot;Bún Chả&quot;, &quot;Mì Quảng&quot; and so on. Many of them seem to follow standard designs, they have the same fonts and colors. 
 Another thing I found unique about Vietnam is that these big signs show food names rather than business names. 
 This makes me wonder: are these signs designed and subsidised by some government agency? Was there a government program that made all food signs look similar to reach other?

                              <span>Hey folks.
 I have several nieces and nephews in the 12-15 age range in south of Rach sỏi, along the delta. I wanted to send them each a story book to help with their interest in reading. I was thinking a Vietnamese translation of the Harry Potter series, but thought I’d ask here to see if there might be some other local recommendations that the kids may have better resonance with. (I’d have my aunt procure them locally, as she lives in rạch giá).
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! I’m getting married this weekend to my fiancée, whose parents emigrated from Vietnam to USA in the late 70’s. I’m very close with her parents. I have no Vietnamese/Asian heritage myself, if that’s relevant.
 I’d like to do a special mother-in-law/son-in-law dance at the western reception, but it’s hard to find a suitable song. I want to find a song in Vietnamese for a slow dance that is appropriate coming from a son-in-law. Many songs about mothers talk about the mother raising the singer, which isn’t genuine to our relationship. I’m hoping to find a song whose lyrics work coming from me.
 Do you know of any sweet, heartfelt songs in Vietnamese that are about a mother-in-law? Or about a mother, but without focusing on how the mother raised the singer? Or a song about an amazing, strong person without any romantic subtext?
 My fiancée’s cousin helped me find Mẹ Yêu by Đỗ Phú Quí, which sounds perfect, but reading a translation of the lyrics, seems to focus too much on how the mother raised the singer. But maybe the sentiment would still work?
 Thank you for helping me make the day special for my (soon-to-be) mother-in-law!

                              <span>My cousin and I are planning a trip to southeast Asia from mid-November thru early December. Most likely a November 14 departure and a December 3-4 return. We are both guys in our mid/late 20s from Los Angeles. We like nature (hiking + excursions), nature sightseeing, large cities, food, and partying.
 We were set on doing 2 weeks in Thailand but are now considering adding 4-5 days in Vietnam due to the recommendations of many family members &amp; friends.
 Our initial plan was to do 3-5 days in Bangkok &amp; Pattaya and then travel south for the remainder of the trip to see Phuket and Koh Phi Phi.
 So my main question is this: If we have 4-5 days, how would you recommend we spend it in Vietnam? Bangkok and Hanoi? Is it possible to truly experience these 2 major Vietnamese cities in that short of time? Should we omit one? Maybe reduce some of our time in Thailand?
 I understand there are dozens of great places we&#x27;ll be missing... But I am hoping some seasoned travelers or residents of either country can give feedback/advice. It is MUCH appreciated!!

                              <span>Been quoted a starting salary, seems alright compared to other options (slightly less then I&#x27;m making working 4 days a week but 12 hours of working, or waiting for a night class), but has Wondering if anyone has taught here.
 I am have a degree in education, am certified teacher in history and English in the United States, as well as have my tefl, a year and a half experience teaching ESL, and about a year in public school in the US. The position they are hiring for is not ESL, but ELA (also potentially a humanities position)
 Any info on average salary and benefits for someone with my credentials, work environment, curriculum, management, etc would be geatly appreciated.
 Main interest is if summer breaks are paid. Also the real amount of work load.
 Thanks a ton! Want to work for a good school longterm .

                              <span>According to Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Thanh Lam, Vietnam leads the world in cyber abuse to cheat and violate the law.
 At the Multi-Channel Management Networking Workshop on the morning of May 27 in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Nguyen Thanh Lam said:
 &quot;For every 100 dong earned from cheating on YouTube, there are 55 dong of Vietnamese users. We are at the top of the list for copyright infringement. There is a football livestream channel that violates copyright like Xoi Lac TV. There is a channel that buys Japanese porn, cuts it into many short clips, and then packs it and sells it to the American audience.&quot;
 Lam said the country in second place in the ranking accounts for only 5% of fraudulent income, one-tenth of Vietnam. Last week, Apple also announced to remove more than 8,000 infringing applications originating in Vietnam, many of which are content creation applications.
 The deputy minister said that this is a sad record, exposing the fact that besides positive content, many creators still do business and make money regardless. Part of the responsibility lies with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook when they can&#x27;t control the content and users on the platform. Advertisers also have a responsibility to still spend money on dirty content.
 &quot;The state does not prevent businesses from wanting to advertise in cyberspace, but it is impossible for a money to flow into malicious content that businesses still see as normal,&quot; Mr. Lam said.

                              <span>Hi!
 We are 3 girls planning a quick getaway trip to Hanoi and Cat Ba island from 28th September-2nd October. Unfortunately we are short on time and so we have planned this itinerary:
 ​
 - Land in Hanoi on 28th Morning, leave directly for Cat Ba, stay in a resort/hotel
 - Leave Cat Ba on 30th Morning, come back to Hanoi, get an AirBnB in/near Old Quarter
 - Checkout on 2nd morning and take the evening flight back to our country
 ​
 I read alot of posts on travelling to Hanoi/Vietnam and I am honestly with too much information and figured it would be better to ask here. Please help me out!
  
Is Cat Ba Island worth it? We wanted to avoid the crowd in Ha Long Bay, but stay near the sea and relax. 
 Any suggestions for Cat Ba, like places to eat/ things to do/ places to stay?
 Best way to travel from Hanoi to Cat Ba and back?
 For Hanoi, we have Egg Coffee, Bahn Mi (and a lot more food items) and Beer Street on our list already, but any hidden/hole in the wall places that are away from commercial tourism would be great to know. Very open to trying authentic vietnamese food and drinks!! 
 Any suggestions for a reputable spa experience in Cat Ba or Hanoi are most welcome
 Any suggestions for where to go for a party in Hanoi? We will be there during the weekend
  
Thank you for taking the time out to read this and so sorry if its a long post!

 I don’t have any experience with teaching so it’ll just be basic vocabulary and sentence structures
 What would be the best free platform to host classes? How should I go about teaching?

                              <span>Like many of you, I am increasingly concerned by the hate and hostility that I see every day in this beautiful community, especially between Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans. 😔 
 It is my firm believe that in our time and age, nothing is more important than mutual respect and understanding. So, in this spirit, I propose a new Vietnamese flag that symbolizes the indestructible friendship between the North and South; a new flag free of bad connotations; a flag that combines the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam. 
 As we strive to foster stronger connections between Vietnamese wherever they may reside or what they believe, it is essential to have a symbol that represents our shared values of friendship and understanding; representing multiculturalism, love, diversity, respect and mutual understanding 🤝🌍

 This proposed flag aims to honor Vietnam&#x27;s rich cultural heritage and traditions (blue) and emphasizes the significance of unity and cooperation (red). The Golden Star represents the everlasting bond between Vietnam&#x27;s people and their striving for greatness and prosperity for all Vietnamese people, regardless of their geographical location or political stances.
 With my loving heart, I invite every one of you to print this flag out, show it to your parents and especially grandparents and display it proudly in your windows. Let&#x27;s propagate the message of love and friendship. Because only as an undivided ONE we can overcome the hate that has tormented this beautiful land for far too long ❤️❤️❤️❤️

                              <span>Planning a trip to ho chi minh for 7 days. Is it way too long? Seems like you can travel the entire Vietnam for that time if you touch and go however it&#x27;s my first time there and I don&#x27;t want to stress myself out by taking a loooooong train or bus ride (I get motion sickness). The flight is already booked so we have to start and end at hcmc no matter what. 
 What do you recommend? Should I 
  
Take it easy and stay entire week in HCMC and go for day trips to cu chi and mekong delta etc
 
Travel to danang/hoi an via plane/train. Will it be too tiring to go there and back to hcmc in 7 days?
 
Spend the time in South Vietnam, going furthest to muine/nha trang?
 
 Or anything in between? 
 Also, are the roads super difficult to cross? I have huge anxiety about this and when I cross the road usually use traffic lights so I&#x27;m super unconfident.
 Also, I&#x27;m going in august.. read that it&#x27;s the rainy season. Should I give up on seeing the beach entirely?

                              <span>Hi there!
 Just curious what my options are for attempting to do this with my fiancé comfortably able to sit on the back (ideally able to strap a backpack to the back as well).
 5 years ago I drove from Hanoi to Saigon via motorbike (without a doubt the greatest travel experience of my life).
 But now I am coming back for a long honeymoon and what to do the Ha Giang Loop which I sadly missed last time around.
 I own a 1000cc motorcycle back home, and have obviously quite a bit of experience driving in Vietnam in previous trips. However, with a second person attached to the back this gets a bit trickier.
 I want something that will comfortable seat both of us for long stints of the drive, and ideally I want to rent this time and not purchase. What do you guys recommend?

                              <span>Hi, I will be doing a 10 day tour in vietnam. Planning to arrive in Ho chi minh city and depart at Hanoi. Flying from HCMC to Hanoi during day 5.
 Currently plan would be 5 days in each city. Looking to visit historical sites and have some good food. Is there any recommended cities other than those?

                              <span>Chào! I’m currently in Vietnam and I have an SSD that is physically broken and cannot be repaired with software. My PC can detect that something is connected but when I try to open it, it doesn’t work. I’ve tried different ways but I’m sure it’s physical damage. Unfortunately, all the pictures of my father who passed away last year are on that SSD (except for some on Facebook). Do you have any recommendations for data recovery services in Hanoi? I will be there next week and I’m hoping to find something there. Cam on guys

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am planning a 16 days trip to North and Central Vietnam this December. Flying into Hanoi and out from Da Nang. 
 I have shortlisted these places.
 Hanoi,
 Ha Long Bay,
 Sapa,
 Ninh Binh,
 Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park,
 Hue,
 Hoi An
 Da Nang.
 16 days is definately too short to visit them all yea? Which one should I miss if so.
 I love nature, history and culture but am also a budget traveler.
 Sorry if I posted at the wrong subreddit.
 Cheers

 I remember hearing from someone there is a Belgian guy who owns a bar in Mui Ne that sells Duval beer on draft and in bottles. Is this true and if yes, does anyone know the name?
 Thanks.

                              <span>In recent years, Vietnam has been making strides in the world of technology and innovation. With the rise of start-ups and the increasing number of high-tech companies moving their branch offices to Vietnam, is there a possibility that Vietnam, this Southeast Asian nation, could become the next start-up nation in Asia?
 The shift from China to Vietnam has been noticeable, with companies such as Samsung, LG, and Intel all establishing a strong presence in Vietnam. This trend is not limited to just large corporations, as start-ups are also finding success in Vietnam&#x27;s growing tech scene.
 One reason for Vietnam&#x27;s appeal is its young and highly educated population. According to the World Bank, nearly 60% of Vietnam&#x27;s population is under the age of 35, and the country boasts a literacy rate of over 95%. This has created a strong talent pool for tech companies to draw from.
 Another factor contributing to Vietnam&#x27;s potential as a start-up nation is its favorable business environment. The Vietnamese government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurship. The country has also made significant improvements in infrastructure, including expanding its internet connectivity and investing in new technology parks.
 However, there are still challenges that Vietnam must overcome in order to fully realize its potential as a start-up nation. One major hurdle is the lack of venture capital funding available for start-ups. While the government has taken steps to address this issue, more needs to be done in order to attract investment and support the growth of new businesses.

                              <span>Just came across this event, looks like it&#x27;s happening on the same days when I&#x27;m in Danang :) Question for locals who&#x27;ve been to the festival before, do I need to buy any tickets for this show? My understanding is it happens on the Han River, so perhaps would be viewable from nearby roads/bridges. Is it worth to buy the tickets explicitly or just enjoy the show for free from outside?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’m currently in HCM and want to get some new glasses since it’s quite affordable. Can anyone who has done it compare the quality of lenses and coatings to those done in the US? Are there any recommendations for places to get them done? Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hi
 I am making plans to visit Vietnam for the first time, landing in Hanoi and planning to spend around a month here. I would love to visit HCMC and do the hiang loop also.
 My concern is with the street dogs that I have seen online in the SEA countries especially in Thailand and I was wondering what the reality of the situation is in Vietnam.
 I am at the level where if I see a dog I will cross the road or go the other way.
 I’ve heard that pretending to pick up a rock and holding a stick / umbrella is good defence.
 Is it realistic for me to have a good time in Vietnam (especially if most my time will be on group tours and city) with the dog population?
 Mainly my fear is with dogs off lead and more so feral/wild/street dogs in packs.
 Thank you very much and apologies for the errors question, I know that dog phobia is not common and that most people love dogs - trust me I do too but I cannot lie about the reality that I fear dogs.

                              <span>Hi,
 I’m considering taking a morning bus form Sa pa to Noi bat airport in Hanoi to fly to my next destination (Da nang) The bus Leaves at 5:45 and arrives directly at the airport, scheduled to arrive at 10:50
 Now, as a first time traveler to vietnam, I will have never taken one of the buses there. Is a flight booked for 13:05 cutting it to close considering the possibility of delays? Would 14:00 be a safer bet? 
 Thank you!!!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been thinking about visiting Saigon/ HCM City this July (would be my first time in Vietnam) but I&#x27;m kinda worried about the humidity, the heat and the rain. 
 From what I&#x27;ve seen the weather seems to be more bearable than in Hanoi but I&#x27;m not quite sure in how far it would allow me to do sightseeing and stuff throughout the day.
 So I was wondering if someone could tell me about the personal experiences in Saigon around this time of year. Do tourists usually visit there in summer? Do public buildings, restaurants and trains have AC? Do locals spend time outside during the day or do they usually try to stay inside?
 Pretty much what I wanna know is if I&#x27;ll be able to have a good time despite the warm weather and rain. I live in Europe and the climate here is quite different from SE Asia, so apologies if some of my questions come across as naive or uneducated. 
 Either way, I know there&#x27;s no definitive answer to this, but any helpful advice is much appreciated!

                              <span>So there a Vietnamese channel that buy youtube ad service to promote recently and one of it famous video is about the YouTubers feed a cat that got chained. As many people said it kinda disturbing bc things like that in their country consider as animal abuse immediately but in VietNam it a dangerous environment in the city if you let your cat roam outside. Also about the physical interact that look like slap actually is a pat but Im not sure bc it a child hit💀. Cats can easily accident unalived by many reasons in my country but I not support thing like that, it just most necessary still depend on the owner and the situation.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ll be visiting Danang from 15th to 19th June. Wanted to check if I&#x27;ll be able to rent a car for self-drive? Scooty will not be an option for me since I&#x27;ll be traveling in a family of 4. I have an Indian driving license. Is that sufficient? Should I get an International Driving Permit? With an IDP can I legally drive around Danang-Hoi An in a car?
 Thanks in Advance!

 Does anyone know where I might find contact lens solution - anywhere in Ha Giang or Cao Bang?
 I am traveling via motorbike and need to find this ASAP as I’ve almost run out! I assumed pharmacies would carry it but that appears to be incorrect. 
 Is there a glasses shop/optometrist in any of the towns on the loop (I’m in Dong Van now), Ha Giang town, or in Cao Bang town maybe?? Google maps doesn’t show anything.. 
 Would be a stupid reason to cut my trip short! 😫

                              <span>I ordered a grab and when it showed up it was a taxi. He started the meter when I got in and when I said no meter, he just said &#x27;no&#x27;, and threw a hat on top of the meter. When I got to my destination he just accepted the grab fee.
 Just wondering what was going on with that?
 PS. He threw the hat in front of the meter and I could still see the fare in the reflection of the windshield. It started off at 10k and rose very slowly. Then randomly jumped to 500k, 1 million before reaching 2 million by the end. The fare ended up being 41k on grab.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to remember something one of my ex-girlfriends use to call me.
 I think it&#x27;s this word, &quot;Dâm tặc&quot;.
 I think this word means &quot;horny dog&quot; or something about being horny. However when I Google translate it says that it means thieves.
 Could someone confirm to me that &quot;Dâm tặc&quot; can mean horny? I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this is the word she use to call me, I just Googled how I think it was spelled and it came up.
 Thanks in advance~!

                              <span>I had an extemely bad experience this morning while walking in Can Tho.
 I have been living in Can Tho since 2011. The city once was really nice, but lately I feel unwelcome and uncomforable here. What I experienced this morning confirms my feelings the more.
 I work self-employed, so I can manage my time. Every morning I take a walk (actually, I want to jog, but the heat...). So I am walking down Nguyen Viet Hong, turn then into a small hem and come out at Le Lai. From there I need to cross the Pham Van Tri and enter the park (Luu Huu Phuoc). Easy. I&#x27;ve been doing it for a long time.
 This morning, when I approached the corner Le Lai/Pham Van Tri, a young Vietnamese, apparently agitated, was standing there. He threw with things onto the cars and motorbikes. I must have looked bewildered. …</span>

                              <span>I worked part-time at a hotel for a few months (as a second job so that I could make a little extra money).
 My co-worker (22 year-old Vietnamese woman who recently graduated from College) came up to me and gave me a $10 Starbucks card on my last day of work.
 I was surprised as her and I got along well when we worked together (but we rarely saw each other/rarely worked together as it is a big hotel).
 I am a 40-year old man and have had many jobs and this is the first time that a co-worker has done this. I think it is very nice.
 Her and I have contact on Linkedin.
 I don&#x27;t mean to &quot;keep score&quot;, but there is something nice that I would like to do for her. Suggestions?
 As an aside: At work I was busy and I never paid much attention to her. In looking back she was very hard working and kind. I have travelled to Japan, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Laos, South Korea, Malaysia and Kong Kong but for some reason I overlooked Vietnam. She got me thinking of Vietnam and I have since developed an interest in travelling there and have read many good things about Vietnamese women.
 Obviously I am not going to be in a relationship with her (not likely with any Vietnamese American for that matter: even in big/diverse cities the Vietnamese are likely less than 1% of the population and moving to Vietnam is not an option).
 Still nice to know that such people exist however.

                              <span>I have family members in Vietnam that I&#x27;d like to buy gifts for. However, I don&#x27;t have any Vietnamese bank accounts (all my bank accounts/credit cards are registered abroad). I&#x27;ve tried Shopee, but they rejected all of my cards (Visa and Mastercard).
 Are there other platforms (that operate/are based in Vietnam) that take international-based credit cards? I&#x27;m open to opening a bank account with international banks like HSBC if that helps. As mentioned in the title, I also have CCND and can open a Vietnamese-based bank account, but I&#x27;m not too sure how the process works.

I was told by someone who is lying to me or it is true. But I find there is nothing in law that says so EXCEPT from 01 January 2023 Ho Khau is being discontinued

                              <span>Xin chào,
 I&#x27;m seeking ideas for small presents for a family.
 What would be welcome or useful that I can get in europe?
 Have been thinking of electronics, basic foodstuffs and also tools useful for people in the countryside.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi all! I have a conference coming up and it&#x27;s been a longtime wish to visit your amazing country. I&#x27;m planning to spend about 2 weeks afterwards, starting around Ho Chi Minh. 
 I&#x27;m thinking about taking the ~12 days guided motorcycle trip to Hanoi then flying back, that sounds simply amazing. But good alternatives would be spending some more time in the city and taking my time in the south instead. I love a good hike or some local culture and would hate to rush things.
 What would be your thoughts on how best to spend the time?

 I&#x27;m going to spend few months this summer at HCM city. I&#x27;m going to do some sort of internship abroad. My company found me an apartment in Phuon 16 of Go Vap. Is this a good place for a foreigner for whom this is the first time in Vietnam ? Do you have any recommendations for me ? 
 Thanks,

                              <span>Xin chào!
 I&#x27;m (33) Australian my wife (30) is Vietnamese lived here since 18 years old. We&#x27;ve been married for 6.5 years together for 10. 
 I&#x27;ve been to Vietnam many times and I love it, when we touch down in Saigon I start getting an almost &#x27;coming home&#x27; vibe. My Viet language skills are actually not too bad, so I can get around by myself, order my own food, shopping, basic conversation. 
 Anyway, my in laws are coming here for a visit, it&#x27;s winter so doing some of the really great Australian outdoor type activities, so we are gonna take them out for dinners, some shows etc. We have planned for a weekend away in a cottage in the countryside with some of my family. Now my in laws speak next to zero english, and my family speak no Viet. 
 I&#x27;m just wondering if anyone might have some suggestions for some good activities we could enjoy together without having to rely to heavily on my wife to translate constantly. Like some games or activities or board games etc. We can do while enjoying a couple of beers by the fireplace. Hopefully someone out there has some suggestions, I just want them to feel like they&#x27;re participating with us rather than just observers.
 Thanks ☺️

                              <span>Just landed at in HCMC. Wanted to share some things I saw for foreigners in terms of how to get into town with zero stress taking a grab.
 1) Go through customs, Exit international terminal. Look for the green umbrella tents across the street. 100 yards max. cant miss them. 5-6 large green umbrellas. I dont ever remember seeing these before. 
 2) open grab and use the green umbrella area as your pick up spot.
 it should cost you 125k dong to get into D1. Grab will add 15k for the airport toll. Total bill should be about 140k + any surge. The driver pays the toll.
 Waiting for grab at 6am &#x3D; 10 mins
 ride to D1 took 15-20 mins.
 Cost was 140k dong which is like 7 bux. and best was ZERO stress of being ripped. had 3-4 taxi guys approach and follow me to grab area.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I was wanting to fly somewhere fun and interesting this winter for vacation and I was interested in visiting Vietnam for it&#x27;s connection to Cold War history even after the Vietnam War.
 However, when looking at tickets for Vietnam through Expedia, I noticed that they aren&#x27;t the cheapest.
 Being a college student on a budget, I was kind of curious if anyone here has a preferred airline they fly with when it comes to Vietnam whether it is to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City?
 Thanks in advance everyone!

                              <span>Hello everyone! I am an American and am planning on visiting Viet Nam this December. I want to preface this by saying I undestand that eating dog meat is a cultural practice and that it is not too different from pigs and chickens (I am vegan and not here to judge). However, I would like to know how visible this trade is when visiting and how I could avoid seeing it. For reference, I will be going from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi and will be visiting other places along the way like Hoi An, Hue, and Phong Nha. Any advice and experiences would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I can&#x27;t ask my friend because it&#x27;s a surprise.

                              <span>Foodie friend asked me to help ask around...
 La Maison 1888 is the French fine dining restaurant of Intercontinental Hotel Da Nang. This hotel is a 30 minute car ride away from the main beach because it is on the far end of the coast, and it does not allow Grab pickups out of the hotel. The restaurant is built into an old villa on a cliff, overlooking the water, and is very beautiful. They emphasize that they have the only 3 Michelin star French chef working there, and claim to be the #1 food destination in Vietnam. (Tasting menu is VND4-5M.)
 The advertising feels scammy because there is no such thing as a Michelin star chef. They claim the chef helped design the menu and he runs a 3 Michelin star restaurant in Paris, which is not the same thing and he is not in the Da Nang restaurant. Vietnam will only get Michelin rated retaurants in 2023, and only in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. There are very few blog reviews about the restaurant, and their TripAdvisor and Google Maps reviews do not imply that this is a legendary must try before you die place.
 Can Vietnam foodies comment?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be travelling to Vietnam soon and I was wondering how careful do I have to be with tap water.
 Not just for drinking but I was wondering about brushing my teeth with tap water, using ice cubes in drinks, etc. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Me and partner are planning to travel to those places. We have been looking for places to visit, to eat and relax. Most of them are tourist attractions and we’re afraid they’re gonna be overcrowded. Does anyone have recommendations on bars, restaurants or some interesting spots, some kind of hidden gems, places that’s not too popular, or some fun activities we should try there? We also plan to rent a bike there to move from Da Nang to Hoi An, if anyone has some tips we would really appreciate it! Thank you!!

I’ve been trekking round Viet Nam for about a week-and-a-half now, and I noticed a lot of people wearing hoodies and all to cover every bit of their body in public and on scooters when it’s 35C+ out. Is there any particular reason for that? I’m sweating myself into oblivion so I can’t imagine walking around in full winter clothing 🥵

                              <span>So as the title says they attempted to delivery the package (Twice) and no one was there which is odd because someone was there. Is there a way they (receiver) can use the tracking number to pick it up? Its a USPS tracking number. I did a bit of research and it seems Vietnam Post is the one who handles this but wanted to gather more info here as well if possible.

 In the past decade, I&#x27;ve grown to truly appreciate and love the heritage my family has provided me with their hard work and successes. Every day it&#x27;s great to know their sacrifices have provided my family its great opportunities. I joke about how I could be a farmer if they never left lol. Several years spent in the military and now I&#x27;m working within one of the biggest international companies.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was an international student in the US and I have been back living in Vietnam for 2 years. Back in US I had no problem driving a car, not gonna say that I’m skilled but I can drive I can do most parking and drive on freeway, but I have so much harder time learning to drive a scooter :( 
 For the most part I am able to drive normally on the road but I find it so hard park in small narrow parking spaces, sometimes there are security men help me sometimes there are not, and in those times when there is no one to help, I have fallen 3 times due to sudden brake when the gas was still on (the place so narrow I was afraid I’m gonna hit objects so I hit brake too sudden) And now I am starting to feel a bit fearful of driving :(

                              <span>I’m currently in Vietnam for a holiday and was very fortunate enough to have family over here to give me free accomodation. In return I’m paying for all our rideshares and just stocking the fridge up with groceries and water as a thanks for the hospitality.
 Anyway I feel like this isn’t enough and seeing the tireless work culture here, I want to give them more practical gifts that can improve their lives in any small way I can
 What do you all reckon would a good gift to get them?

Any recommendations on a reliable provider which I can pay online? Should I just order from Shopee? Apologies for the daft question as I’m ordering from overseas and not familiar with the providers locally

                              <span>Hello, 
 First of all I spent 6 weeks in Vietnam and absolutely loved it the people are emazing, countryside beautiful as well as amazing food. I would love to revisit and go to the parts I didn&#x27;t have time to see. 
 Im posting on here because I&#x27;m looking for a friend I met on a night out in Hanoi on the 4th May called Patrick who is Swedish. I&#x27;m female from the UK, we had a great time when we met but we didn&#x27;t get chance to exchange any contact details. I think he&#x27;s still in Vietnam in HCMC, I&#x27;m now not. If you&#x27;re on here hit me up, it would be nice to see what you are up to. Absolute long shot and very unlikely they are on here (I probably won&#x27;t ever find him.) 
 (I&#x27;m not sure if this is allowed on here and I will delete if not. Before I get any hate I understand that there are hundreds and thousands of tourists in Vietnam. Just thought I&#x27;d see if I could reconnect)

 I only take small dosage(0.25-0.5mg) and it&#x27;s not for recreational use fyi.

                              <span>For Vietnamese people who moved abroad - what do you wish your English teacher had taught you? Is there any specific grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation that comes up a lot in your life now but that you didn&#x27;t learn in class? 
 I&#x27;m an English teacher for adults in HCMC and trying to find useful/interesting topics for my students. :
 I asked some Vietnamese friends and one mentioned the pronunciation of &quot;calendar and lavender&quot; and the use of &quot;ish&quot; (ie &#x27;the party starts at ten-ish&#x27;). I&#x27;m looking for more examples.

 Me: Born in late 1980s
 We immigrated to the USA in the mid 1990s and all became US citizens over the next 10-20 years. I&#x27;m trying to resolve a USA pension related issue for my parents and it has been a nightmare because they didn&#x27;t keep copies of the forms that I need. Pretty much the only significant documentation I&#x27;ve gotten from them is my refugee card and my Certificate of Citizenship.
 I&#x27;m tried pretty much everything I can think of to prove their marriage status but unfortunately:
 1) They never owned property
 2) They don&#x27;t have a copy of their last joint tax filing (which would be 2015 or 2016). I&#x27;m currently trying to track down where they filed their taxes to see if I can get a copy, I also plan to contact the IRS.
 3) Social Security doesn&#x27;t have them listed as each other&#x27;s spouses even though they did provide me with a form that said my dad would translate for his wife, which is my mom (WHAT THE FUCK)

 For rides that are long and outside of the city, I plan to use a private car/limousine instead of a bus (I dont think Grab and Taxis are avaialble) . Wondering what the trusted ones are !]
 If it helps, I plan to go to areas outside of the cities like Phong Nha and drive to Da nang.

                              <span>Hey, going to ho chi Minh this summer (12june) for an internship (4weeks) &amp; for two weeks of travel up north.
 They&#x27;ve said I can do my internship whenever I want, so I can decide when I travel. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s best to travel in June 12-30 and then do my internship, or in July (after my internship)..or if there will be any difference at all 
 was hoping I&#x27;d be able to hike in sa pa and phong nha. I know it&#x27;s rainy season,, but I am not sure if this means absolutely no hiking or nature ever, or if it&#x27;ll just vary day by day ?
 :) I&#x27;m excited to live in HCMC
 I&#x27;m super keen to spend some time in jungles too--i wanted to do this tour, https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-ba-deep-jungle-expedition/ but it&#x27;s 2 grand ... Any tips ? If I find a tent and someone cool to come with me, ? 
 Would really appreciate Any advice/comments you have, and if you have any special places to recommend id be very very grateful :)
 Thanks

                              <span>There&#x27;s something about malls/supermarkets in Vietnam that makes me feel like it&#x27;s more interesting and luxurious. In the US they just feel mainstream and &quot;I go there just to buy stuff&quot; kind of feeling. In Vietnam going to a supermarket is like being on a fun trip. For example a trip to Coop Mart was a lot more fascinating than walking around in Walmart. Maybe because I was young and poor so memories were more fond?
 ** Ok so I&#x27;m probably wrong about the malls. But what about the supermarkets? Is it fair to compare Walmart, Target and Costco to Coop Mart and Lotte Mart?

 Does anyone know of where I could get a bonsai tree in Saigon? 
 I’ve seen sellers on the sides of the road in areas like D12, Đào Tiên, and a few others spots but they’re hit or miss on what they have or if the trees are real, so I want to see if anyone here knows where to snag a good deal on a bonsai tree.

                              <span>Hi r/VietNam, I have heard people getting their drone confiscated at Danang Intl. airport. I have alos heard people not getting a response from the office that is responsible for drone permits. I have a DJI mini drone and am wondering where I can apply for a permit (at least try to) and if I should be worried about getting my drone confiscated. I know there are other posts about this but i haven&#x27;t got a definitive answer yet. Thanks for any help.
 Edit 1: I should also add that I do not plan to fly in, or close to any city, police or goverment building.

                              <span>Does anyone know where I can get a dose of rabies immunoglobulin in Hanoi? 
 I just got bitten by a dog today in Sapa. I got the first dose of the Abhayrab vaccine immediately (about 1 hour) after being bit. But the hospital here didn’t have immunoglobulin. Planning to head back to Hanoi tomorrow to try and find it. 
 Thanks

Mình sợ xe to lắm, do mình nhiều lần đi trong tỉnh bị xe khách với container ép xíu rơi xuống ruộng rồi (đi trong sg thì chưa gặp khó khăn vì có tách làn container và xe máy rồi). Nên mình muốn hỏi đường nào đi an toàn và ít gặp xe to nhất. Mình nên đi khung giờ nào thì ít xe to nhất. Mình cũng không biết sửa xe, vậy trong trường hợp xe hư thì mình nên làm gì. Mọi người giải đáp giúp mình nha 😁.

I came here with a YouTuber who was doing a small meet and greet with some of his followers with the intention of scouting out new exotic fruits at markets and orchards and we ended up trying over 75 varieties of fruits, most of which I had never had before in the USA. 
 This was my first time ever leaving the USA and to be honest, I didn’t know too much about Vietnam before taking the trip. I was really just looking forward to leaving the USA and experiencing a new spot on the globe, and the opportunity to go to VN just landed in my lap. I have to say, I was blown away by your country.

Like an event, business strategy etc. The very next day you will wake up to see 10 other people trying to do the exact same thing as you!!! It’s like this everywhere. But I can’t help but think it’s a bit extreme here. 
 Has anyone else experienced this?

 My husband wants 2 custom suits done and we will be in Ho Chi Minh city about 2 weeks. Does anyone have a good recommendation for a tailor? Thank you!

                              <span>Hey guys, I would like to share some Vietnamese learning resource. I&#x27;m heading to homeland in about a month so trying to learn as much as I can before I leave. I was studying using pimsleur for learning Portuguese which I have a review here. I was studying that for 6 months and I think it helped me in learning vietnamese and made it quite a breeze. Listening to the audio, while writing down everything really helps for my learning and it&#x27;s well paced. I recommend pimsleur for any viet kieus that never got around to learning vietnamese.

                              <span>I want to preface that I am not from Vietnam, but I am of Vietnamese descent (both parents were born and raised in Vietnam). Where I’m from there’s lots of people who are also of Vietnamese descent, but I’ve noticed that around 20-40% of these people are also mixed with Chinese. Is it the same in Vietnam? I know that China and Vietnam use to be on bad terms (might still be?) yet VietChinese people are so prevalent.

                              <span>I&#x27;m 22 (from Canada) and have been to vietnam 4 times in my life and 3 of those times was during the summer months because of school and once last November because I was done school.
 2024 Tết there could be a chance I&#x27;m free to head back to Vietnam in February to celebrate tet with my family (currently waiting to see if i&#x27;m accepted into my masters program that starts this upcoming september)..
 Curious what the experience is like in Vietnam during Tết? To me it probably would be something cool and new since I never got to see it before.. but to my family over there they probably experienced it too many times already.
 Every Vietnam trip I stay in Hue and HCM city,

                              <span>When in Thailand I got full body massages once a week. No happy endings, and never had it on my list of things to try. I just wanted to relax my muscles from full days of walking, and only went to places that had signs saying &quot;no sex&quot;.
 Landed in Hanoi a few days ago and went for a full body Vietnamese massage at a parlor where the women were dressed up in everyday clothing. So I thought this massage was gonna be like in Thailand, and solely for muscle relaxation and recovery from walking.
 I turn on my back and massage was good, then all of a sudden I start to notice the lady spending a lot of time in my groin region. I thought i may have felt really tight there, so maybe she was working out some knots..
 I was wrong, I was getting aroused, and she knew as well. Then tells me she&#x27;ll give me a good massage and motions for a &quot;special&quot; type of massage..
 There was NO intentions of me getting one, and I thought I was just getting a regular massage as I always have in Thailand.
 Anyone else have this happen?? It was pretty funny looking back at it, and still no &quot;special massages&quot; since being in Asia.

                              <span>I work in healthcare in the US and don’t have any kids of my own. I have a big maternal instinct however. I’m looking to volunteer for a few weeks with kids somewhere in Vietnam, like an orphanage. I would like to help out just in nanny sorts of duties. I don’t speak the language, however. Does anyone have any leads I can follow?

Basically, my girlfriend is Vietnamese and at the moment we are in a different country right now (different from my home country as well). What would be some sweet things that I can do for her, I mean in terms connected to Vietnam? Basically something thoughtful that would make her to remember about her country. Thank you so much in advance!

Would there be any festive activities going around that time? Foreigners, what did you enjoy if you’d been to Lao Cai that time of the year? TIA!

                              <span>Hi all, I have about 2 weeks left in VietNam and was planning on visiting Cat Ba island, Ninh Binh and Phong Na for 2 nights each and Hoi An and HCMC for 3 nights each. Plus a couple of nights on sleeper buses.
 Does this seem like the right mix, or should I reallocate my time at all? Thanks!!

                              <span>Staying in Hanoi and looking for a tour with transport included. Most online are 1 day tours that do all the main bits (along the river / cave / up the steps). Many of the 2 day tours do not seem much different... just wanted to ask if it is worth spending longer here or if a 12 hour tour is sufficient?

                              <span>My Viet boyfriend and I (South Korean girl) have dated for a year. We’re at the same age (2000 kids). We studied abroad at the same uni in Canada. Last year, my parents came to Canada to attend my convocation. I introduced him to my parents, and they&#x27;re really impressed with him bc of his family background, handsome face, height, education and graduation job (these things are very important in Korean culture), 
 Next month, he and I will travel to Vietnam for summer vacation and visit his parents in Hanoi. I wanna make them impressed just like he did on my mom and dad. 
 What can I do to impress his parents?Especially when I come to his family house, and we do not speak the same language. 
 Do old Viet people judge girls by their look, family background like Korean do? I’m quite confident but I don’t look like Viet girls.
 My Viet female friend say Hanoi parents are extremely conservative. Is that true?
 What gifts should I give to them? I have some high-end korean skincare products for his mom, but have no idea for his dad.
 Update: thank you guys for great suggestions. As I know from my Viet female friend, his parents are well off and live in a big mansion in Hanoi. That could mean they’re open minded like you guys commented. I’m confident in answering all questions regarding family background, I know rich Asian people care about these things. My dad also asked him about his dad’s job when we had dinner in Toronto. My boy has a brother who has a wife working as IELTS teacher. Both of them can speak English, so luckily I have more people to talk without translation and support me. So excited to come to 🇻🇳🇻🇳 for the first time

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;ll be visiting Vietnam in about a month. I&#x27;m allergic to mollusks (clams, mussels, oysters, snails) but not all shellfish. I am fine with fish, lobster, crab, and shrimp. I&#x27;m not deathly allergic - I just get a gastrointestinal reaction but that would ruin a day or two of the trip! What is the best way to make sure my food will not have mollusks in it? I&#x27;d like to have some seafood. What things should I avoid and what should I say to someone to ask if the dish has mollusks in it? Thank you

                              <span>Travelling to Vietnam this November and looking for reccomendations for a Halong Bay 2 day, 1 night cruise please!
 I&#x27;m looking for a cruise which covers the main highlights in Halong Bay, including Ti Top Island and any of the floating villages.
 Ideally the price of the cruise would include travel to and from Hanoi as that&#x27;s where we are staying.
 Budget is between £150-200.
 Thanks! 🛳️

 I was in Hanoi a couple of months ago and ended up in a hotpot restaurant. I ate something I still cannot identify. Can you please help?
 I am talking about the YELLOW balls in this picture:

                              <span>recently arrived in HCM airport, after clearing passport and customs, i proceeded to counters near the exit to book my taxi as usual, after i boarded the taxi, when taxi just about to exit airport toll, the driver aaked for money for toll, usually the drivers dont ask for toll money but i thought to myself as this is only 15k vnd, i obliged, as i was pulling out notes from my wallet, the driver mumbled something about small money, to my horror he reached into my wallet and started to pull out some notes, which i immediately grabbed hold of his hand and stopped him, an argument ensues and he started driving back to the airport taxi parking area and stopped there, long story short, after much argument, he proceeded to hand me over to another taxi driver of another company. after which i notice that his vehicle had not had any company logo. 
 so as advice to all traveling to hcm airport, only book taxi from companies and issues receipt, but now a days vinasun and malinh counters or liason taxi handlers started to behave more like gangsters, that&#x27;s why i started using taxi companies before the exit, looks like im running out of options, except to book grab or gojek

                              <span>I have been traveling throughout Vietnam and never had any issues with any street vendors till I came to Hanoi. They have been very honest and professional. A few folks I met along the way had warned me about Hanoi. I had bought some donuts for 50k. I did not have any small change so I gave her 500k and asked for 450k back. She pretend to gave me an extra donut and move away so I asked for my change. She brought out her purse and said this was what I gave her (50k). I had to wait for another order from another vendor and by the time I went back to her, she had already disappeared! Just be careful and use small changes especially with street vendors!

                              <span>In English, assuming you don’t know their rank (and 99% of people likely wouldn’t) you simply use ‘officer’. I’ve also learnt enough Vietnamese to know the pronouns system is a complete and utter pain in the backside. 
 I’ve been pulled over a few times by the CSGT and am wondering if there’s a polite way in Vietnamese to do the same thing.

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 Planning a trip with some friends in June from Australia. Will be mostly staying in Saigon with a stop at Dalat and then Nha Trang then back to saigon.
 We decided to opt in for the sleeper bus route but just wondering if these are best to be booked in vietnam themselves or can be done from a reputable online website. Any thoughts?

 Why is this so complicated? Can someone tell me the best way to get some spending cash in Vietnam? Good ATMs to go to that won&#x27;t rip you off too much?

                              <span>I’ve been traveling in Vietnam for a a little over a week and was in Thailand for a month before that.
 This past week I started getting diarrhea. Not in the ill, going multiple times a day way. But every morning I wake up a bit earlier than usual with the urge to go. And my stool is like water.
 Normal appetite, no cramps, no nausea, nothing. I’m vegetarian, so haven’t eaten any weird meats.
 The first night it started was after I did a caving tour. We used our guide’s water filter straw but that was it. Also, seems a bit fast for it to be related to that? Either way, I don’t know. Just a thought. 
 Otherwise I feel fine! Great energy. It’s just that my usual daily bowel movement is watery diarrhea.
 Suggestions?

                              <span>Hi guys, Im from Australia going to Vietnam next month and will be staying with relatives so just working out how much to bring/carry per day.
 Was just wondering which note is best to have as in it won&#x27;t be too large for street vendors to provide change but not too small to give multiple notes to restaurants etc? The zeros are a bit daunting
 Also what are typical costs of things over there eg grocery, street food, etc ?
 Thanks in advanced

 I saw that there&#x27;s a seafood buffet in a hotel which is $55 usd, but is there somewhere that locals go?

Since they will pay me when the jobs are done, I want to know how to transfer money from Philippines to Vietnam. I don&#x27;t have Philippines bank accounts and am currently living in Vietnam.
 There is only one option I know is using PayPal but the fee it charges me really expensive.
 For those having some experiences, can you share with me the way how to deal with?
 Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>Hi all, new to this post but planning a potential trip to Vietnam (starting in Hanoi) and renting bikes for about two weeks to tour around Vietnam. Is it a bad idea since it’s the hottest part of the year? Any tips and recommendation for potential routes would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I arrived in Ha Long Bay today and am staying bai chay. I’m a little surprised as I expected Ha Long Bay to be super touristy with the classic backpacker scene, but have not seen another backpacker so far. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad thing, i’m just a little confused and wondered if another part of Ha Long Bay is where backpackers tend to go?

 I’m staying in HN for the next 2 months and want to connect with the Start Up and Digital Nomad community here. Do you have any recommendations where to meet people ? What platform do people here use to connect and network ? Where should I look for events or gatherings ? I’m thinking about visiting some co-working spaces, joining meetup.com events and search for FB-groups. I’m thankful for any info or tip.
 Have a great day people !

                              <span>Sup peeps. I&#x27;m staying in Saigon for a week. I&#x27;m coming for the food. The cheap, wonderful, delicious street food. Currently looking for a hotel/homestay but I don&#x27;t know which area to choose. I want to be surrounded by street food. I want to be in the heart of the street food action. Which area should I stay in? Thanks guys.

                              <span>After my previous post here- https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/13lhuw3/pros_and_cons_of_trying_dog_meat_in_vietnam/ I&#x27;ve decided to try dog and cat as well during my trip to Vietnam.
 I grew up on a farm in the midwest of the US, and I love animals. I actually think cows and pigs are just as smart and loving, if not more, than dogs, so I realized that I don&#x27;t really have an issue eating dogs due to abuse because cows/pigs in the US are brutalized far more than dogs in vietnam (look up factory farming practices in the US if you don&#x27;t believe me, it is truly an abomination).
 However, I&#x27;d like to &quot;kill two birds with one stone&quot;, if you will. Can anyone recommend me a high quality restaurant (don&#x27;t want to eat some street dog/cat or something) that serves both dog and cat? I would like to try both, but I don&#x27;t want to go to two separate establishments to try.

So for the two litre allowance, can I bring forty sample bottles of 50ml? We run a boutique homestay and wanted to bring premium liquor such as Blue label. Will customs give me trouble?

                              <span>I&#x27;m Vietnamese. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of negative feelings toward the Japanese among Vietnamese people, but the vast majority of them are based on how people act today. Many Vietnamese, for example, believe that the Japanese look down on them.
 However, on Voz, I&#x27;ve seen some Vietnamese incorporate history into their viewpoint. Some people believe that modern Japanese people are &quot;disgusting&quot; because they are descended from bad people.
 I&#x27;m curious if any of the Vietnamese people here have similar thoughts. For example, should we be cautious around a Japanese person simply because they are Japanese?
 I don&#x27;t ask this question just because. I&#x27;m about to start working for a Japanese company in Vietnam, and I don&#x27;t want anything like this to get in my way.

                              <span>Hey all, thinking of purchasing a vehicle, and those mini hatchbacks you see all over seem to be what I&#x27;m looking for. Perfect for getting in and out of my small street and driveway. 
 The VinFast Fadil, after some initial research, seems like a solid option. It&#x27;s both cheaper in VN and seemingly has more features than the competitors like the Toyota Wigo, Honda Brio, or Chevrolet Spark...
 However, I haven&#x27;t been able to find any decent English reviews of the car online. Can anyone who has owned one share their experiences? Are they a reliable car? Worth the 380 million or so to purchase one?

                              <span>My partner and I would love to come to Vietnam from Scotland for our honeymoon. I know that some places are being hit with an unsustainable amount of tourism right now, and we would prefer to contribute to some ethical causes if possible. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions for some not-for-profit organisations that might benefit from our tourism / donations / contributions? 
 For example, when I visited Bolivia some years ago I joined a not-for-profit tour group that took us on hikes to see the mountains, and the money we spent was used to benefit the local communities. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone I’m a long time lurker but can’t find any proper advice on this. My partner and I are staying in Ninh Binh want to rent a motorbike to see Tam Coc while we’re here as I feel it would be a waste not to. We’re just super nervous about renting a motorbike/scooter. I’m used to mopeds a little and we rented one earlier in our trip on Langkawi in Malaysia. But Vietnam traffic is something else lol, I feel confident enough to do it but wondering what other people’s experiences driving Ninh Binh to Tam Coc is? Outside the town how safe are the roads? Thank u in advance and if there’s anything we should see while I’m Tam Coc any recommendations would be welcome!

                              <span>Despite growing up in the midwest of America, I am a VERY adventurous eater and have traveled to a few exotic places, always trying the local foods.
 There are a few things I will stay away from, mostly bugs/spiders/roaches, etc, but I&#x27;ve eaten crickets and scorpions.
 I am a bit torn because I researched that you can find dog in Vietnam and that it&#x27;s actually pretty common. I&#x27;m debating on whether or not I should try it. Is it safe to eat? Like are these dogs bred to be eaten or are they diseased street animals that are caught and cooked?
 By the way, while I love dogs, I find it somewhat hypocritical that people will turn a blind eye to the atrocious factory farming practices deployed on cows and pigs, while judging the shit out of people who eat dog. As someone who grew up on a farm, I can tell you that both cows and pigs are just as intelligent, if not more, than most dogs. Cows will actually get to know you and love you, just like a dog, so please let&#x27;s not judge people who eat dogs when America brutalizes and tortures cows.

 My girlfriend is aVietnamese citizen in the US on a student Visa. 
 On a trip home from Vietnam today she lost her passport during a connecting flight. 
 Is there some way she can get a new passport in the US? She lives in Chicago so there are no embassies or consulates nearby. 
 If anyone has experienced this and can help it would be much appreciated.
 Thanks

                              <span>I’m from the US and my mom is from Long Xuyen. It’s been a dream of mine to see where she grew up. My honeymoon is in January, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to go to Vietnam especially with good weather conditions during that time of year. However, I haven’t traveled internationally in over a decade so I’m nervous for the language barrier and ideally I’d want to visit multiple cities but this seems complicated in Vietnam. I also want to see Da Nang’s beach. Is seeing Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and Long Xuyen possible in a two week trip? I’ve been told by people to “hire a driver” but Ho Chi Minh and Long Xuyen are 3 hours apart, so I’m not sure if this is doable. I was thinking of flying of Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh, but I’m not sure how that would be either. Any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I have a Vietnamese friend named Nghi. I always pronounced it at “knee” until one day she told me that’s technically not how it’s pronounced and it’s typically hard for English speakers to get the proper pronunciation. I don’t see her often but she’s visiting me this summer and I would love to be able to say her name properly. If there’s a video or audio clip of someone saying the name that would be even better. Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hi, Im a vietnamese who lived in canada for a little over 5 years and has fallen into the personal electric vehicle addiction, currently owning two electric skateboards and going to pick up an euc soon (electric unicycle). Started off as a commuting purpose but soon turned into a hobby/addiction cause of how fun I can get on these pevs especially freely going around the city.
 Id love to take my EUC back to Vietnam but arent too sure about the laws and regulation behind these things, id assume they would be on the same level as those electric moped that the high school kids used to ride on but i can be wrong. Tried doing some research on it but not a lot of results came up. I know these arent technically legal but are they like super restricted or is it like &quot;you are technically not supposed to ride them but I dont care enough&quot; kinda thing. Would love to hear what you have in mind.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, long story short, I had an opportunity to go to Hanoi yesterday and will be leaving in 2 days.
 I&#x27;m trying to research things about the country, including what to do and what NOT to do, but I was wondering if anyone could throw a few tips my way, mostly to help me avoid getting scammed.
 I have travelled to a few asian countries- Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and China (Major cities only). Is Vietnam/Hanoi similar to any of those places?
 I guess my questions would be (sorry for the ignorance, usually I research a place I go to for weeks, but I don&#x27;t really have time for this trip.
 1) Is street food safe to eat? Water at restaurants? Do you ask for &quot;no ice&quot; due to bacteria issues?
 2) What is the best way to get around? Uber? Taxi? etc
 3) Any recommendations on what to do?
 4) Shopping tips? I would like to buy some knives and sandals and cool collectables. I hear knives are very cheap and well made in Vietnam.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 My question is about obtaining my background check for Vietnam. When selecting the purpose of the check, am I supposed to select “for personal review” or “living abroad/visa requirement”? I’m using accurate biometrics, and the only advice I could find is for Korea, which may have different requirements than Vietnam. 
 I have seen that when teaching in Korea, they tell you to select personal review. However that leaves a notice on the paper that states “not valid for use abroad” or something along these terms. However the hagwons seem to accept it anyway, and I’m not sure if that’s the same as Vietnam. 
 Has anyone here used Accurate Biometrics before, and which option did you select before submitting your request? 
 In the second to last drop down box on the demographics page, did you select for personal review, or the “visa requirement/living abroad” option? I want to make sure I check the correct box during the process to ensure I get the proper results needed.

                              <span>I am currently travelling in this beautiful country. Mostly in the North but planning on travelling down South. While I have been enjoying my time here, I have Ibeen wondering if the extreme heat and heavy air pollution has been normal in the recent days/weeks. 
 Currently in Hue and from my googling it seems that it is one of the most polluted cities at the moment. Is this business as usual or do people here consider it unusually bad?
 Still, food is great, people are wonderful and life is good!

                              <span>So yesterday i met a couple of guys from my country and we drank beer and had a good time on the party street. Next thing i know is that im sitting on a random guys scooter on the way to his apartment, i dont remember his face, i dont remember him taking my phone at all. What i remember is just being very upset about losing my phone but still remained relatively calm. In a proper manner, i asked a guy in a green uniform who was nearby when it happend (i think) and it just felt like he was part of it all. 
 The guy has withdrawn more than $600 (the card was in the phonecase&quot;, do you think its possible to get this back because i am already on a tight budget... Maybe need to make police report for that and im probably leaving tomorrow. Whats even more scary is how he knew my pin-code. Something that sucks too is that all my pictures are gone. This was a big shit storm and it has completely ruined my mood and now i probably cant continue traveling as long as I planed.
 Has anyone been in this situation before? I would gladly take all tips from you guys.

I reported it to reception, confronted the cleaning lady, they are trying to look at the cameras now, but say it&#x27;s stopped working. I said we are going to the police now for it.

I want to know how safe I would be, if there are any specific restaurants or types of restaurants you can recommend in the HCMC area? My friend is Viet so she can translate for me, but I do want to be vert careful obviously. I am worried about the cross-contamination and ovsiouly nuts or shellfish being present in a dish I eat. Thank you so much for any advice you have.

                              <span>Hello everyone! Currently planning a trip to Vietnam for 6-7 days in mid June, and would appreciate advice/ opinions on my current (tentative) itinerary! I love temples, museums, and am ok with not seeing any beaches &amp; don’t mind ‘tourist traps’ :) 
 Day 1: Arrive in Da Nang + head to Hoi An 
 Day 2: Explore Hoi An 
 Day 3: Hoi An + head to Da Nang at night/ sleep 
 Day 4: Morning flight from Da Nang &gt; Hanoi + explore Hanoi
 Day 5: Day trip to Halong Bay 
 Day 6: Explore Hanoi 
 Day 7: Explore Hanoi + fly back 
 I omitted Hue just because of the distance from Da Nang &amp; really want to see the lanterns + tailor shops in Hoi An, but I am also wondering if this schedule is too packed. In between squeezing in two regions of Vietnam vs staying in Hanoi the entire trip (and maybe adding in additional day trips) / saving Hoi An + Hue for a later time, which would you all suggest? 
 Thank you :)

                              <span>Hello!
 My 2 friends and I are headed to Vietnam from October 9th to 18th. We are wanting to spend 2 nights out of the city hiking or at a beach town. We would prefer that the drive from the city to 2 night stay location is about 3 hours or so. Then, 3 days in the city indulging in food/drinks, day activities, etc. 
  
Should we go to Hanoi or HCMC?
 I did a little research and saw that it was a bit colder and slightly rainy. Kind of like winter. I&#x27;m curious about what locals say the weather is like there during the middle of October.
 For Hanoi and HCMC what are the best hikes/towns/beach areas to spend 2 nights at?
  
Any other recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I live on the coast so I&#x27;m constantly exposed to harsh sunlight. I&#x27;ve noticed that alot of Vietnamese women aren&#x27;t tanned at all, for example their hands and face are the same color and not different skin tones like i have. I&#x27;m pretty light skinned but just got super tanned cuz i was out today. Any tips on how yall avoid getting tanned?

                              <span>TLDR: i need recommendations for the best vietnamese learning/studying resources available for purchase IN Vietnam!!! 
 hello everyone! this is my first post here, but I’d really like to get some feedback on this as i just had this idea pop into my head this morning. 
 so my fiancé is vietnamese and he’s back in vietnam visiting family after having moved away about 13 years ago. he’s from saigon. 
 i’ve been trying to get him to teach me vietnamese but he hasn’t been very good at it 🤣 i’m very familiar with self studying languages as i’ve been studying mandarin for about 12 years now, so i’m more than willing to get a few resources to learn on my own and just ask him questions when i have any. 
 any and all recommendations would be greatly appreciated! specific book/show/movie/etc recommendations preferred since my fiancé doesn’t really know what to look for since he’s not familiar with modern learning resources available in Vietnam.

Have fallen in love with your country. for many reasons and no (happy ending massage is not one of them) I’ve toured VN and I think da nang is the easiest most welcoming area for a Canadian who only speaks English? My khe area. Any other suggestions? I am aware of the complications. I will be living in VN for 3 months at a time when the tourist visas are extended.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on vacation in Vietnam right now and a pretty big plant enthusiast. There are many different kind of banana plants and I especially like the one being grown here in Vietnam so I&#x27;d really like to take one home. I can&#x27;t get one like this in my home country so this is the only way. From what I know I have to carry a phytosanitary certificate for this. Now, I have a couple of questions:
 1.) what exactly is a banana plant called in vietnamese and in what kind of shop can I buy one? Most garden shops don&#x27;t sell those. They grow everywhere but I can&#x27;t just steal one, right?
 2.) for phytosanitary certificate I found this site. I&#x27;m at a hotel in Hanoi so I could just drive there. My main concerns are: Are 7 days enough time? Do I need a real adress in Vietnam? What would it cost?
 Thank you in advance &lt;3

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was planning to rent a motorbike and head up to the sand dunes. I intend to hire a quad bike or something when I&#x27;m there. 
 But I&#x27;ve seen this notice in my hotel. Is this true, should I be concerned? Or do you think this is the hotel trying to sell tours?
 I have a license to ride a motorcycle and have the right international license for Vietnam. Is this still illegal?
 Thanks. Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I have family that owns two large houses in Vietnam, one in Hue, about a 5 minute walk from Báo Quốc Temple and another in Quan Nam, 20 mins drive from Da Nang. They&#x27;re convinced that the Hue house is worth over $500k and the other house is worth nearly $200k USD. I&#x27;m not so convinced they&#x27;re worth that much but then again I lived in the U.S my whole life, so I honestly wouldn&#x27;t know. So my question is how much is a large 5 bedroom house with a store front on the lower level worth?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sourcing freelancer and I found that many businesses would like to work with Vietnam but there is no trade platform to connect Vietnamese factories to worldwide buyers. They can go to Alibaba but it&#x27;s full of traders on there. And Alibaba is expensive for small factories. Anyone that in e-commerce could give me an insight why there is no trading platform for Vietnamese factories?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Does anyone has experience with ILA and VUS I would definitely appreciate any previous experiences as my current advisor for the job is not responding back at all, and none of my colleagues can reach her either to further process me. I’m thinking I will go on their website and reapply, also apply to VUS. Any advice and experience stories is much appreciated.
 I really would like to know about the work cultures, salary differences (I’ve seen other posts and I believe they’re around the same) and how reliable both are in terms of getting people processed effectively without issues.

                              <span>I will be traveling with my family and then solo. My family is not into climbing. How is the climbing scene in Vietnam? I am debating if I should bring any gear like shoes and a harness or just rent them. Is it easy to meet other climbers or get good climbing guides? I am not looking to climb anything specific, just want to get out and climb in a different country.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just had a very chilling taxi experience 30 minutes after stepping off the plane fresh into Vietnam.
 Went outside for a cigarette before booking a taxi to the local bus station, when a young local nearby comes over and asks if I want a taxi. He tells me hes a grab driver and flashes his phone at me with the app up. Normally I&#x27;d make my excuses and leave but it had been a long day travelling and I had a sleeper bus to catch to Ha Giang. 
 He beckons me to follow him and we walk past the taxi ranks to the car park. I assumed he was just parked up having a ciggy so dont think much of it. Theres a car half pulled into a bay that he walks upto and knocks on the window. Weird but I thought maybe hes passing the job onto his friend.

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I’m getting going to Saigon for beginning a TESOL career, and I figure I’d give some insight into my current expenses saved as an aviation ”engineer” in the states and see what everyone thinks on do-ability with moving abroad based on the current savings and all. 
 For starters, I’m in my mid-twenties, been an aviation “engineer” for a couple years and absolutely despise every single aspect of it besides the pay. I have about $25,900 (₫607,000,000) saved after travel expenses and hotel accommodations. And have all the useful medicinals, adapter, luggage, devices, etc. that I will both want and need for the move. I have my business visa, company processed and getting my work permit, bachelors degree, TESOL certificate, but I still need some advice from here on how to get m…</span>

                              <span>In my recent (first) visit to Vietnam, I loved a bunch of things. However, observed a strange behaviour at the jewellery stores in HCMC. We were staying near Binh Thanh market and there were a bunch of jewellery shops there. Strangely enough, a couple of them, I think those were gold &amp; diamond stores, did not allow us to enter and were very rude. In one such outlet (picture attached), the guard blocked our way, and just kept saying &quot;No&quot;. Not sure if they were just prejudiced against us (Indians) or was it something else. Racism is something I have never observed in oriental countries.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Canadian currently learning Vietnamese for fun, in hopes of visiting someday. 
 I am about 1/3rd the way through the Duolingo course on day 120. I obviously don&#x27;t know much, but im starting to be able to pull out and hear random peices of vocabulary if I watch the news or something. 
 Id like to start immersing myself in the music now, any and all suggestions will be listened too. ❤️ Ty kindly.
 Edit: skimmed and listened to most, đen vâu so far is my favourite. Thanks so much everyone.

He abuses them and even gave one permanent brain damage. Hes even bragging online how much money he makes in a week but lies to his followers and begs for money everyday. He has a youtube of 691k followers, a store online, swimwear store, patreon, paypal and youtube money not to mention tictok. @tiutac is his name, if you can report him on youtube that would be great too. I would be willing to pay you and for your ride to the police station and if the police wont act i have cash i can pay, but i dont want to arrest him corruptly. I have evidence of all of his abuse and scams. He even tried to scam people out of their life savings 50k usd for a website that never existed.

                              <span>Just a friendly reminder to Americans teaching in Vietnam. Avoid Apax Leaders like the plague. I knew what I was getting into when I started but they are somehow worse than even I expected. Regardless most teachers have left the company and they are searching for American teachers specifically. On paper they offer a pretty good contract but they don’t fulfill any of those commitments. I know there’s probably a million other posts like this but I just wanted to bring it home again that Apax Leaders should be avoided altogether unless you enjoy working for free.

                              <span>I received a job offer to teach English with Athena education, based in Hanoi. My salary would be approximately 10mil VND per week. Is this a decent salary? Would I be able to save money and live comfortably with this much pay? It seems as though I will need to travel up to 10km throughout the city to different schools, is public transportation reliable enough to get to the schools in a punctual manner.
 I have never been to Vietnam or anywhere in Asia. Thanks!

                              <span>Basically, I&#x27;ve noticed that Vietnam&#x27;s road signs are similar to the road signs in other post-Soviet countries, or Russia. However, does anyone have any more details on this? I mean, this makes less sense than in, for instance, Azerbaijan, which was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, therefore was under Soviet control.
 Did, by any chance, Vietnam simply copy their signs from the Soviets/Russia, taking their obvious friendly relations into account?

                              <span>I don’t speak Vietnamese at all but have made a bunch of new friends while I am visiting. One friend tagged a photo of her and I with “2 ae đáng iu”. What does that mean? 
 I can’t get the exact translation in google translate but it says something along the lines of people in love. I don’t want her to get the wrong idea because we are not in a romantic relationship.

                              <span>Hello, Redditor of Vietnamese. I am from India and wanted to know your thoughts regarding something. We Indians love Vietnam a lot. I know many people visit Vietnam for vacation or to take some time off, as hill stations in India have become increasingly expensive and overcrowded. I talked with a few friends, and they had such a great time there visiting and talking with you folks, so really, thank you for your hospitality
 I would love to know did you have people met any Indian tourists here and what were your general impressions of us.

                              <span>Hello there. Growing up I watched a vietnamese show with my parents on TV. I can&#x27;t seem to remember the show now and was hoping if any of yall know. All I remember is that it&#x27;s about a girl who works as a cook and herbalist for the emperor. At some point she loses her sense of taste, but continues to be an amazing cook. Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a drummer who knows a little guitar. I studied music in university but struggled with singing. I know my theory and can match pitch but struggle singing on my own. I&#x27;m looking for an instructor (if you speak English this will be easier, still working on my vietnamese). I can sing a c scale while playing it on guitar and and can fake it in d minor but that&#x27;s about it. If there are any instructors here I could use the help. I&#x27;m not trying to be an amazing singer but I would like to be able to sing backup for a rock/multiple subgenre band. If there are any vocal coaches, I want to improve my skills and am interested in your services. If there are any pros who can help I&#x27;m interested in your services. Thank you. If you offer vocal lessons please reach out. I live in Sài Gòn and can use all the help I can get. Message me if you are a teacher. Cảm ơn.

Nobody has made a video about this guy and im really surprised because he has 600k subs, he only has about 10 comments a video because most people try to warn new viewers of his abuse. I have alot of evidence including where he visits and possibly his ID and address city, i also have pictures of his route to the mangroves he visits so i know the general area. He&#x27;s drowned an otter as punishment and gave it brain damage and it later died, he kept it locked in a small budgie cage where it couldn&#x27;t even turn around and would defecate and urinate all over itself.

                              <span>Spending a lot of time in Vietnam right now and I&#x27;ve seen so many Korean tourists. Way more than other Asian tourists. So any reason for this? I know there&#x27;s direct flights to Da Nang from Korea but surely Korea is nice enough to just vacation at home instead? Is Vietnamese cuisine is incredibly popular with Koreans or is it the exchange rate? Are there a lot of Korean companies in Vietnam nowadays (meaning they aren&#x27;t actually tourists but they live &amp; work here)? Genuinely curious.

 I’ll be staying in Hanoi next week and was wondering if there are any hobby water polo teams around which I can join for training. Back in Germany I am part of our University team and I’d love to play/train/connect during my holidays. 
 Let me know if you there is a team I could contact! 
 Thank you.

                              <span>Khi xem các phim Hồng Kông, Trung Quốc cũ trên các kênh SCTV, mình thấy giọng lồng tiếng không giống với giọng diễn viên miền trong trên các phim Việt Nam chiếu cùng kênh.
 Mình thắc mắc liệu giọng lồng tiếng này có phải là một giọng được phát minh ra giống như giọng Mid-Atlantic trong phim Hollywood cũ không. Hay là cái giọng trong mấy phim Châu Tinh Trì là có thật?

I can tell because I&#x27;ll overhear them speaking in their accent, or they just look stereotypically British (lots of tattoos, women tend to be on the stockier side). Is Vietnam very popular place for British people or what?

                              <span>I have this annoying pet peeve when it comes to parking my motorbike, whether it is in front of a restaurant or in some motorbike parking that when I come back I always find my bike: 1) moved somewhere else and mashed between other motorbikes, 2) the dude is sitting on my motorbike and smoking a cigarette, 3) both 1 and 2. I’ve been living here for about 5 years now and it still bothers me til this day. If I frequent a place then I usually build a relationship with the guy and give him a little extra coffee money to leave my bike where it is and to not do the things I stated above so it works out. But, when it’s a new place that I barely go to I usually don’t have that luxury and I become quite annoyed by this experience every time. I have a little bit of OCD and care about the condition of my motorbike and would like to keep it in nice condition. It really bothers me that I spend a lot of time and money to keep it nice just for some guy who doesn’t give a fuck to erase all those efforts in a matter of 10 minutes and scratch it all up. I understand that I don’t deserve special treatment when there are other people besides me, but this standard of service shouldn’t be ok especially when it’s my personal property and I am parking to be a customer at the place. 
 If this sort of thing also bothers you, how do you deal with it? I find that most locals with old and beaten bikes do not care. But what if you have a nice modded bike or even a big bike that costs 150mil + vnd? Any suggestions or tips?

                              <span>Hi! I am returning to Vietnam this year (in a few weeks) and I’d like to find some stuff to do that’s a bit different to the typical tourist activities. I’ve booked two weeks in Ho Chi Minh City (located I. District 1) and will be hiring a motorbike to get around (not opposed to getting on a domestic flight though).
 I spent 1 month travelling around Vietnam last year and had an amazing time, I’ve always been curious around this country and the people and I was not disappointed! 
 I am a contemporary artist and work for a University of Fine Arts in Australia so I am really looking for creative things to partake in. There must be a network of musicians and artists in this wonderful city of millions!? When researching online for things to check out it seems like only the really obvious stuff comes up (I can’t help but wonder if it’s because I’m searching from within Australia). I want to see exhibitions by local, innovative artists, maybe undertake some workshops in craft traditions and music gigs by exciting Vietnamese bands! Where can I go or what venues offer this? (not interested in night clubs haha). Thanks for any suggestions ✌️🙏👍

 ​
 I dont care if its pirated websites either way changing my vpn to VN for Netflix seems it keeps logging me out of the account and unable to log back in so might as well use Pirated websites. Would Fmovies or soapdrama have them?

                              <span>I have been in Vietnam for a few months now and I have been staying with my grandma in Bình Dương . A week from now I will be moving to Da Nang. I have multiple long term plans of what I am trying to do here in Vietnam, so I will be staying in Da Nang indefinitely. I am looking for a place that I can volunteer in exchange of accommodation, whether it would be teaching kids English, taking care of the elderly, or tending to the victims of agent orange, v.v...
 Doing this will give me a chance to integrate and connect with the locals easier. This is what I did when I first moved to Thailand and also in Portugal. In the meantime during my volunteering, I would be exploring, trying to get familiar with the area and also attempting to find my own place. Will be truly grateful for anyone who has experience in volunteering in Da Nang and be willing to share and help me out with this.

                              <span>Hey everyone, found a real love for your music since being in the country (from UK) ie DJ Bay Phong and HPVTV DJ Mat Xac. Where is the best place in HCM to find this music on a night out? If you guys have raves with this music as well that would be cool. Looking to go out tonight. Cheers and thank you for your help in advance

                              <span>Hi there! I have just started my part-time Vietnamese classes in preparation for a job posting in Hanoi. My teacher recommends Duolingo for expanding my vocabulary outside of class, but friends have had mixed experiences with Duolingo for other languages. Do you agree that Duolingo is the best Vietnamese learning app or should I consider another?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello everybody !
 I&#x27;m from France and I visited Vietnam in october 2018. I loved your country so much, it must have been the best travel of my life. After that, I got interested in vietnamese culture, the food, the language, the music. I listened to popular vietnamese songs on Youtube. Not the oldschool, historically famous ones. More like the hits of the last few years.
 ​
 I remember listening to one song in particular and I just can&#x27;t find it anymore. It wasnt the best song or anything, but it bugs me because I can see the video clip in my head and it&#x27;s frustrating. Here is what I know about it : 
  
The main singer was a man 
 It was released before the end of 2019
 The clip is at night, in a big city. A man and a woman are having fun, getting drunk, playing pool. And there&#x27;s an underlying love story
 I think he&#x27;s hoping something happens betweem them 
 I think it was rap. But maybe not 100% rap ? 
  
I know it&#x27;s not much... But if it rings a bell to anyone, it would make my day and remind me great memories ! Thank you

                              <span>Hello, it’s been a few of days since I moved to HCMC, I put up in District 4 and was looking to buy some cigarettes. Asked around in the convenience stores and from the little bit we could communicate through google translate, all of them said they don’t sell cigarettes in the area. Will I get some at Circle K in District 1 or just from roadside sellers? (Haven’t gone beyond my area because work ends at dusk, and I did go out the first day after work but got spooked because got approached by different men twice asking where I am from and stuff so not stepping out in the evening anymore)

I thought i could feature a story of one person that experienced this. If any of you happen to know someone that would like to share their story, please let me know. Thanks for the help!

                              <span>We had heard to just pick up a SIM card at the airport when we landed in Ho Chi Minh. From our research we saw that Viettel was the best so we walked over to the Viettel stall to the far right of the airport when you get off and bought a SIM card. They put it in my phone and taped my old SIM to the card that came with the new sim like they do in every country when you do this. I had to ask for a sim removal tool (usually it comes with the new sim pack) and the lady dug up a paper clip (This was my first clue something was wrong) and taped that to the card as well. I’d been kinda distracted because of the full theater you have to go through with the passport pictures and then your picture and then they call in both and a live operator video chats you to make sure you’re real.

                              <span>Hello! Just like the title says, would anyone here know where to find Hobonichi planners in HCMC? The Hobonichi Techo in particular.
 I check majority of Fahasa bookstores when I pass them and the occasional stationery shop but I can&#x27;t seem to find this specific brand. Not available on Shopee, Lazada, etc. either ):
 I would love for any specific shop names if you know any, and any other suggestions as well! Ordering and shipping directly from the website is kinda my last resort.
 Thank you in advance! ((:

 Tôi đã thử yêu thêm vài người khác, nhưng tôi luôn trong trạng thái nghi ngờ họ. Thật tệ, tôi không muốn như vậy, đã 10 năm nhưng tôi k thể nào thoát ra luồng suy nghĩ trên được 🫠. 
 Thật sự cần lời khuyên.

                              <span>So me and my partner were walking in some park in HCMC and a guy appeared from nowhere and started pointing at my partner’s shoe. We didn’t understand what he meant so he came closer and took out a funny brush from his “shoe repair and maintenance box” and started quickly washing my bf’s shoes. We both said “No” about five times and soon there was another guy attacking my shoes. They basically took of our shoes from our feet - pretended to wash them with their super duper chemicals and glued an extra heel on my bf’s Birkenstock sandals (which of course came off after a few days and looks hilarious). After finishing their grand hard work of one minute they asked us 500.000 dongs from each of us (~40 euros in total). It’s not that I didn’t expect for them to ask money, I understood it from the very beginning but they were really good and quick in undressing us.. I gave them 500.000 (shouldn’t have) and they asked for another half. I literally showed them my wallet - I didn’t have that much. It is funny that they didn’t agree to take less than 500.000 - they were insisting on their price and I started finally showing my attitude, saying that we didn’t want their “service” in the first place and that we don’t have more money. So I told them let’s call the police. They didn’t like the idea and their hooligan leader took my bf’s shoe and threw it in the trash bin direction. We quickly vanished afterwards. So, our stupidity is not under a question mark - it was our first day in Vietnam, we were probably jetlagged and awed, and just fools. However, we indeed said “no” many many times and actually the next level would’ve been shouting, which we didn’t even consider and our politeness costed us 500000 dongs. My question is about the police - which side would’ve they taken? I assume this shoe business is illegal and we would’ve been right? But I saw so many people in forms in the city (I assume - policemen) - how come is their business still running?

                              <span>Chao moi nguoi,
 Anh la nguoi Viet Kieu! I plan to work remotely in Sai Gon for about five weeks this mid-August and spend time with my significant other. I want to understand if any modest to upscale furnished apartments in Sai Gon cater to individuals like myself. Previously, I stayed at Cherry Hotel and Apartment in Tan Binh last month for vacation. At the bare minimum, I need high-speed and a reliable Internet connection since I work in I.T., specifically software programming. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m planning to travel to Vietnam (29/F) landing in Ho Chi Minh City. I&#x27;m well travelled in Europe but it will be my first time in Asia. I will join a tour for most of my stay but was planning on arriving in advance to get over jet lag and relax a bit. Do you have any tips for my safety and to avoid scams? Where should I stay and what transport is best from the airport? I read about some taxi scams? I&#x27;d be happy to splurge a bit to be in a nice hotel with a swimming pool where I could meet other travellers perhaps and explore the area in advance of the tour (50-75 euro per night). Also, should I have predominantly cash in the local currency? Any generic advice would be appreciated as I&#x27;m getting nervous!

I’ve been reading online that taxis there turn off their meters and charge unreasonable prices. If not, is there any easier way to travel around? I can’t rent a moto or a car to go around yet.

                              <span>For context, my partner and I live together with his parents, but we are not married. We also live in a European country. My partner has lived here since birth and his parents came here i think shortly after the war. They are both from northern Vietnam. I have only lived here for 4 years. I refer to them as bố and mẹ since I&#x27;m learning Vietnamese, and bố told me that since my partner and I are living together, it is the same as being married in Vietnam, and that it&#x27;s fine for me to call them bố and mẹ since its normal to call your in-laws mom and dad, and this is also common in the culture that I grew up in. The issue/thing that is confusing me is that while neither have an issue with me calling them that, bố always responds for himself as bố , while mẹ switches between mẹ and cô. I only use simple vietnamese at the moment, but an example would be:I: khi nào bố sẽ đi làm ? B: bố đi làm lúc (time)
 Mẹ would use the same or respond with cô. Is this a regional or cultural thing, or is this because there is no blood relation? I don&#x27;t think I have heard her use it with my partner or her daughter, but it oculd be that I missed it because I&#x27;m still learning the language. I also thought that it might be similar to how bạn, tôi is used as another exception pronoun. Do other non-vietnamese people also refer to their vietnamese in-laws in the same way?

                              <span>I would like to learn more about Vietnam’s politics. The way that the locals see it.
 However, I cannot just look it up online because what is posted about how the government works is not how it goes in real life. 
 For example this was on the official government site: The Constitution clearly indicates that the state power is in the hand of the people. The State is of the people, by the people and for the people.

I (31) live abroad and don’t really want to talk to her anymore. I feel bad about it but really I can’t compromise to let my mom decide my life. Any advice?

                              <span>Found these pieces, as well as other items, while cleaning out my in-laws’ house. They were fairly large prints that were on some type of material that I hadn’t seen before. Not your typical art canvas or cloth. Had kind of rubbery texture to it. I ended up making digital copies of them. 
 There are signatures on each them that I can’t make out. Does anyone have an idea of what region of VN could’ve been the inspiration for these pieces? They’re beautiful and I want to know more about them.

                              <span>Hi there, im planning to take a trip to Hanoi, Da Nang &amp; Phu Quoc around mid June/July but the general advice online says it’s rainy season. I dont mind the rain but ive also been told it’s unbearably hot during this time too so not sure what to think. 
 My husbands and I will be travelling with our 3 year old and worried it might be unbearable for her since she’s never been to a country that hot before. Any advice of these 3 cities will be much appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am a person who lives in the USA. I visited Vietnam over the new year holiday and absolutely fell in love with the country. I visited my wife’s family in HCMC and now I have dreams of coming to live there too. I, of course, would try to find our own place to live as I would never want to burden my wife’s family.
 However, when telling my wife’s family that I want to move there they continuously tell us never to move there. When asked if they would ever move to the USA they always say no because it is boring, dangerous, and they love the life they have in Vietnam. I don’t understand why someone would tell me not to live somewhere if they would not leave that place at the first opportunity. They live a great life in Vietnam and my wife’s brother is always taking trips to other nearby countries and buying expensive things as a flight attendant. 
 I make a lot more money here in the USA, but with the rising cost of living and potential economic recession, I wish for a life that is much simpler. Am I wrong for wanting that? Am I wrong for thinking they might be hypocrites? Am I wrong for thinking I could have a much more comfortable life there? Please let me know.

                              <span>is this really a thing? from what people have told me. if your family fought for the south. the government can look up your records. if your family had anything to do with the south. they would punish your family for about 5 generations. for example, less opportunities among other things. Let&#x27;s say my grandparents fought for the south. I have less opportunities than people who fought for the north. it would be harder for me to get into universities regardless of my test scores. i will never get into politics or work for the government.

I&#x27;ve probably killed 30 so far but they keep on coming. Do you think my light is attracting them? I don&#x27;t want to turn the light off because they&#x27;re freaking me out. I don&#x27;t think I will be able to relax.

Don’t feel like I’ve been to overly touristy places but it seems odd to me, don’t imagine locals pay these prices? Granted it is my fault stopping in places with no prices advertised. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;m near done mapping out a trip to Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. I have a hostel for Ho Chi Minh but plan to just find places to stay as I go and stop. I’m getting a motorbike so these places that are for 1 day are just stop overs with maybe ¾ of the day for exploring, hence the odd day calculations…just want to be realistic.
 In total the trip is 29 days long but ultimately wondering what people’s opinions are at the times in these locations? Am I spending too much/too little time in places or prioritizing the wrong places? The only thing set in stone is Ha Long Bay, I’ll need to be there by the 26th day. My hostel in HCMC is also booked but was $12/night so is a wash if things change.
 The trip is pretty linear so things to an extent can be cut and put other places. Would love folks opinions cause most things I read say everywhere is amazing and I don’t have all the time haha!
 (3.75 days) Days 1 to 5 Ho Chi Minh City
 *I originally had 3 days is this too much time at 4 days? Worried Jet lag will put me out of commission for the day, but I arrive around noon my first day
 (1.75 days) Day 5 to 7 Phan Thiet/Mui Ne
 *Should I take a day here and give it to Dalat? Should I skip?
 (.75 days) Day 7 to 8 Dalat
 (1.75 days) Day 8 to 10 Nha Trong
 (.75 days) Days 10 to 11 Quy Nhon
 *Could go straight to Pleiku but have heard good things about Quy Nhon?
 (.75 days) Days 11 to 12 Pleiku
 (2.75 days) Days 12 to 15 Hoi An/Da Nang
 (1.75 days) Days 15 to 17 Hue
 (1.75 days) Days 17 to 19 Phong Nha
 *Wanted to do only 1 day but think if I wanna see the caves will need a whole extra day
 (.75 days) Days 19 to 20 Vinh or Thai Hoa
 *OR I am going to skip and take a bus from Dong Hoi to Ninh Binh saving a day
 (1.75 days) Days 20 to 22 Ninh Binh
 (3.75 days) Days 22 to 26 Hanoi
 (2.75 days) Days 26 to 28 Ha Long Bay *Already booked
 (1 day) Day 28-29 Stay Near Airport in Hanoi and Go Home

                              <span>So I was studying in an VUS English center. While in conversation with another classmate. He is joking me like hanging his hand like he’s pretend to grab a string. I dunno what he was doing and he slapped me hard (my head hurts afterwards). So guys, what do you guys think about this situation?

                              <span>Good evening everyone. Hoping this topic is ok to discuss here. I just found out that Vietnam has one of the most liberal laws on abortion. Would just like to ask if abortion procedure is available for tourist. I’m suspecting that I am currently pregnant (around week 2) and can’t afford to have this at the moment due to multiple personal problems. Thank you and sorry if i offend anyone here regarding this topic.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I want to make a music playlist or compilation for my parents of music they might have listened to in their youth. It&#x27;s both for them just for fun but also in case one of them develops dementia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. If you didn&#x27;t know, playing music from someone&#x27;s formative years can help them have clear and lucid moments if they have a cognitive degenerative disease. 
 Does anyone have specific artist suggestions and where to find them? I am in the US so I usually use Youtube or Spotify to search for music and I&#x27;m not aware of what services in VN would have music from that era. Anyway, when I have searched on google, I see a lot of articles about early rock and roll in Sai Gon. I don&#x27;t think my parents would have listened to that or gone to any of those clubs since they are from Central and rarely traveled to Sai Gon. 
 I believe it would be very meaningful to my parents so thank you in advance.

                              <span>are 3d graphics specialists and graphic designers in demand here? 
 I am a 3d generalist, mid, and thinking about moving to Vietnam and while I can continue working as a freelancer, having a local job would be very interesting and more comfortable in terms of visa. 
 I am capable of making character animations, garments, modeling and textures, can set up the environment and do common designer tasks from time to time (building a website (frontend), logo, banners).
