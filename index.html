                              <span>Help! Aussie Husband and I are currently in HCM before flying to Hoi An (yeah I know we fly into Da Nang). Been to one bar, Chin Chin so far. Fabulous place but omg the music is too loud (can‚Äôt hear my husband speak loud because Britney is louder than loud). Is there a gay bar/venue/pub that‚Äôs not ear splitting loud and us older Australian gays would be able to sit, drink, talk? Thanks üôè

                              <span>Hey fellow travelers!
 I am travelling to Veitnam with my GF from 1-9 Oct. Landing in Hanoi and going back home from via Phu Quoc.
 So my Plan is: 1. 4 Days in Hanoi Ha long and Ninh Binh 2. Maybe Hoi an and danang 3. And last 2-3 Days in Phu quoc
 What I am actually confused about is whether my gf and I should go to Hoi an or not as it is monsoon season with risk of flooding. Also our iternary is too tight ;(
 So I wanted your advice on whether we should do Hoi an or visit some place else considering the weather conditions.
 It is our first time in Vietnam so we want to make sure to experience the best.
 Please help üòì , I am pretty confused about how to do this.

                              <span>Hi I‚Äôm planning on visiting Vietnam next year and was just wondering how much I could possibly see in 2 weeks, which order would make this the most efficient, and what time of year would be best.
 I‚Äôd love to visit 
 Visit Halong Bay, Cat Ba Island, cave in Phong Nha National Park, War museum, Ban Gioc Waterfall, Golden Hands Bridge, And the Ha Giang Loop
 Is there anything else you would consider a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù or anything that‚Äôs not really worth it ?

                              <span>Hi all, I will be on vacation to Hanoi soon, and I am wondering how the weather is like there. I know it is quite warm, seen from weather forecast. What do people usually wear in such weather? 
 Also, what is the average price of food in Hanoi? What are some things I should look out for (food poisoning, for example)? 
 Thank you

                              <span>Hello! My friend and I are traveling to Vietnam in January for 14 days. We are very torn on what cities to travel too and want to able too explore as much as we can. We also are doing research on the country before we go, but any tips would be very appreciated. We have some cities in mind but would like to get opinions from people who have actually been to Vietnam!

                              <span>As a gay man myself, everyone, every person I know no matter gay or straight both tell me that one day I should move out of here to Saigon, and it&#x27;s better for me there. 
 I&#x27;ve heard of this so much in my life that I considered it to be true. So I decided to visit Saigon once and twice, and I do believe they&#x27;re right. I can&#x27;t speak for the every Saigonese, I know that even for the most progressive cities, there would be people who have problems with gay people. 
 But I saw much much much more gay couples walking on the street compared to here in Hanoi. At the last firework show at the countdown thing for lunar new year, I could witness at least 6 gay couples within my eye view, some holding hand and some even had their heads on the other&#x27;s shoulder, and honestly nobody really gave a shit. ‚Ä¶</span>

 Just wanted to post here to express how much I fucking adore this place, and random observations i have made. There are some issues and I&#x27;ll post about problems as well, but I really like Vietnam a lot.
 I&#x27;m not just some backpacker. I really did my homework on this place before coming here. It has allowed me to integrate here way faster than most people. In the space of a few days I bought a motor bike and started renting an apartment.
 I&#x27;m an English teacher (obvious I guess) and my salary is higher than many locals so I guess that clouds my perceptions of this place a little bit.
 Everything here is so much cheaper than back home. The west is stagnating and many millennials are financially fucked. Out here its possible to actually hustle ahead rather‚Ä¶</span>

It would be a shame to explore on my own so was hopefully looking for people I could join. I‚Äôm ok if it‚Äôs just us two or if I can join your group. Leaving some information about me just so I don‚Äôt come off as a stranger.
 I‚Äôm 23 male from the Philippines currently working in global banking and finance. A personal goal I have over the next few years is to explore asia and I‚Äôll be going to Singapore next year to watch Taylor Swift. Im responsible when I drink and can look after myself as well

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never been in a romantic relationship with anyone in my entire life and I fail to see how this might change in the long run. I personally don&#x27;t think I would be suitable for any kind of romantic relationship and the mere thought of being forced into / being a part of one makes me feel hopeless and sick. Marriage is obviously out of the question. Having kids also seems to me to be an enormous and exhaustive investment and I would not want to force any potential child to live in this increasingly difficult society without having, you know, their consent.
 However, it&#x27;s all too common that people from the older generation here tend to think that my position on marriage is simply insane and my parents are no exception. They did not stress much about the fact that I&#x27;ve never cared to have a partner (they think I&#x27;m the hot shit and millions of people would die to be wedded to me, which is objectively not the case). But now that I almost finish university and still make no move whatsoever, they constantly bring this topic up and push me to go out into the world and look for someone who would marry me and have my kid. It was kinda heartbreaking to see how badly they want to have grandchildren so I fucked up by telling them that I would marry really late, like at my 40s so that they would stop pestering me about that in the near future (and also once I&#x27;m 40s I could tell them that I&#x27;m too old for marriage). They got mildly frustrated and forced me to marry 5 years from now, for many reasons.
 People who choose to stay single, what should I do? Because I told them that I would marry late, they now think that marriage is still on the table and all they need to do is to force me to marry way sooner than I&#x27;d like. What can I say to them so that they would accept the fact that they would not have grandchildren and that their son would not marry, (and that they and I might get side-eye from relatives because of this decision)?
 I would really appreciate your responses!

Is there anywhere on here to avoid or skip? Places that we should make the effort to go to on the way? Any advice would be appreciated :)

                              <span>I, from the North, had a chance to visit Saigon for a month. Everyone I knew told me to be careful with my belonging when I&#x27;m there, especially with me having to be extra careful because I&#x27;m careless and always walk around using my phone.
 First day in Saigon, I took a bus, and forgot my wallet with all my cash and all kinds of identification papers on there. I was so scared, I couldn&#x27;t do anything without them, I couldn&#x27;t even go back home if I wanted to without those papers. I remembered the number of the bus, the number on them showed the route they took, but couldn&#x27;t remember the exact plate numbers of the specific one I got on. There were many different busses numbered the same. 
 I thought it was the end for me. Turned out 1 and a half hour later, I found it sitting still, untouched and intact in the same bus seat I was sitting in, despite being a very crowed day with lots of people in and out of busses. During my time in Saigon, I all walked around the streets with my eyes glued to the phone, because habits. So far, nobody has tried to grab it from me. Maybe the rumors that Saigon is full of petty crime thefts is largely exaggerated?
 But hey, this could simply fall in the case of &quot;this-has-never-happened-to-me-so-it-must-not-be-true&quot; fallacy people often use. Maybe because I&#x27;m a dude?

                              <span>My partner and I are planning on visiting Vietnam around March / April next year and am having a bit of difficulty nailing down a trip that doesn&#x27;t seem too packed! We&#x27;re in our early 30&#x27;s and like a bit of a mix of adventure (more myself) and relaxation (beach time).
 We&#x27;re travelling from Australia and there aren&#x27;t any direct flights to Hanoi so we&#x27;ll be flying in and out of HCMC.
 Below is a planned schedule but something (maybe multi destinations) have to go unless we can pull superhuman strength. We&#x27;re locked into 17 nights and can&#x27;t do any longer unfortunately. Would love to hear your recommendations about what you might consider leaving off, and where to possibly spend a bit more time.
 Day 1 ‚Äì Fly into Saigon. Arrive late so just stay somewhere near the airport.
 Day 2-3 - Fly to Hanoi. Spend 2 nights staying in Old Quarter, visit some sights, food tour etc.
 Day 4 - Spend morning in Hanoi before getting an afternoon bus / limousine to Ha Giang so we can see the views on the way (or should we just get a later bus and spend a few more hours in Hanoi?)
 Day 5-6 - 2 night Ha Giang Loop tour
 Day 7 - Finish Ha Giang Loop and arrive back in Hanoi late
 Day 8 - Do an overnight cruise in La Han Bay
 Day 9-10 - Head to Ninh Binh (Tam Coc) for 2 nights
 Day 11 - Spend day exploring Ninh Binh before getting overnight train to Dong Hoi
 Day 12-13 - Get bus from Dong Hoi to Phong Nha, explore caves and do a single day tour with Oxalis / Jungle Boss
 Day 14 - Get DMZ bus to Hue
 Day 15-17 - Motorcycle ride from Hue to Hoi An via Hai Van Pass, spend 3 nights in Hoi An relaxing / beach time
 Day 18 - Flight from Danang to HCMC before flying out late that night
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I am looking into getting my Vietnamese Passport and am wondering if there is anyone out there similar to me and is familiar with the process.
 I was adopted from Vietnam in 1997, shortly after became a U.S. Citizen with US Passport, etc. My adoptive parents have my original Vietnamese birth certificate and papers, since I was born in Vietnam.
 Is it a tough process to get a Vietnamese Passport? From what I read it seems like as long as I have the correct Vietnamese Paperwork it should just be a submission and waiting period. I would like to have both my US and Vietnamese Passports. Any help is much appreciated!

                              <span>attened an event where we did the national anthem (official one). And I placed my right hand over chest as I was singing it. One dude told me that only Americans do that? Which is weird, since I know it&#x27;s optional to place one&#x27;s hand over chest while doing the anthem, and it means pledging allegiance to the flag but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s exclusive for Americans. Just out of curiosity, just pop the question to see if anybody&#x27;s done the same.

                              <span>Hopefully on the correct subreddit, but my friend and I are about to book flight tickets and the flight back home will be quite early in the morning (8am). I saw people saying it is recommended to arrive 2‚Äì3 hours earlier just in case, and we are fine with that however, this means that we would need to be taking the grab from our Airbnb to the airport probably at 4/5am in the morning. 
 My question is, is it safe to take a grab car this early in the morning? We would be in Ho Chi Minh! We just want to have some confirmation that it is indeed safe, as we are both quite young and have never really travelled before. Thank you! :-)

                              <span>Danang has been a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the big city life but I just walked past an empty street, full of vendors with cartfull of nicely presented, but untouched, foods and it made me feel all kinds of ways. I bought a coconut off a lady at a drinks stall just cause she seemed really sad sitting there alone and I felt a little choked up thinking about how much she might have sold tonight in the muggy heat. 
 I get that it‚Äôs off season now but it really feels like this town lives off of tourism as I don‚Äôt see a lot of locals dining out and I might be projecting but a lot of the businesses seem to be struggling. 
 I just feel very sad seeing all these restaurants with flashy signs sitting empty and potentially even guilty when I make eye contact with the employees inside as I catch glimmers of hope in their eyes that I might come in and dine. 
 I‚Äôm recovering from a tummy bug and taking precautions as to not eat at empty places and there are so many coconuts I can buy from a place to support the local businesses. 
 It‚Äôs really lovely here though and the people have been so kind. Other than being slightly hotter, it hasn‚Äôt even been as rainy as in HCMC so I wish more people would come and visit this lovely place.

                              <span>Hi, had a job interview and everything was ok but when I mentioned I was Muslim i got told That it would be hard because their customers aren‚Äôt comfortable with that. I understand stereotypes exist and people in different regions of the world give more credit to them than other parts of the world. Do people in Vietnam in generally have a thing against Muslims ? No judgment, people can think what they like I just want to know because I‚Äôve never come across this in Vietnam before (although I wasn‚Äôt that shocked, I wanted to know if there‚Äôs any truth to it) .
 Edit: the second question she asked me was about religion after the usual tell me about yourself. Looking back I should have asked if it‚Äôs relevant but I didn‚Äôt think it would be a problem. Seeing Vietnam‚Äôs views on religion I totally understand but she mentioned Muslims and her clients not liking the idea of it.

                              <span>Me (24) and he(24). We have been in a relationship for 2 years now and I moved to live with him. And I realize he has redflag. He always hit himself by banging his head) when I said I want to break up or When I don‚Äôt want to talk to him. Most of the time he bit himself I saw it all. And I feel like he is threatening me. Especially, he makes more money than me. I always heard he said that: &quot;I think some people make little money because they were lazy in school, blabla&quot;. Also, he always talks &quot;I want to have a million dollar, so I need to save more money,.. &quot;I feel it&#x27;s good and I know he can gain to it. But I feel very tired when I listen to this thing every day. I also feel we didn&#x27;t match in this relationship. What should I do?. I am afraid of a day when I want to break up with him, he will do something silly

And, if it&#x27;s common, any tips on particular dishes to avoid?
 I&#x27;m deathly allergic to cashews and pistachios but I can eat peanuts, almonds, walnuts, and pecans -- though I don&#x27;t always trust folks to make that distinction.

                              <span>Hello! Anyone based in Da Nang that can give me some tips or warnings when looking for apartment? I&#x27;ll be staying in Da Nang for 3 months starting on October and I booked a hotel on my first week while I find a long term apartment rental. 
 My budget is only 2-3mil and I saw that most of rentals in Facebook groups are way out of my budget. What&#x27;s the usual monthly range for a decent apartment for 1 person? 
 I&#x27;m looking for a place in the An Thuong area since that&#x27;s where our co working is at. 
 Any tips/advice for me?

                              <span>One of my favorite places to get coffee was the one right by my granny&#x27;s home, an old lady would sell beverages to the local construction workers there, and her coffee would be around 20000 VND. I had been drinking her Ca Phe Sua Da for years, and I loved it so much I would buy one almost every single day. Unfortunately, she closed the place indefinitely around a month ago, and I have tried many places since.
 The one thing I noticed was I would find the street coffees drastically better than the ones sold in those fancy cafeteria places with ACs and Jazz music playing 24/7. The street Ca Phe Sua Da are sweet, rich, just bitter enough, and their temperature is perfect - not too hot, not too cold. 
 It is extremely hard to match the flavor with the one I had been drinking for all these years though. Some places make it too bitter with little sweetness, some make it taste like a milkshake. The &quot;closest&quot; one which I kind of enjoy comes from, you guest it, the nice middle-aged lady not too far away from my grandma&#x27;s home. 
 Is there a secret to those street coffees? I want to remake it myself, all those years drinking her coffee and now she closed it, it kinda hurt a little bit :&gt;

                              <span>Vietnam non-expert here, thanks in advance for your patience and replies.
 My question is about both politics and economics.
 Vietnam is considered to be more open than China, in terms of investment as well as censorship.
 However, China also had a period where it was considered much more open than it is today.
 Many people describe Vietnam as being very similar to China, only delayed by 20 years or so. On the other side, some people say that there is a qualitative difference between the two countries, due to the different &quot;tone&quot; under which Vietnam was founded - Ho Chi Minh being a world traveler, having Democratic hopes for Vietnam, appreciating Western Democracy, etc. Those people also say that power is a bit less centralized in Vietnam&#x27;s system.
 However, without institutions in place ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I‚Äôve been close to this one vietnamese girl ( elder than me around 30‚Äôs) . I am really into her and i travelled to HCM just to see her. She works in malaysia and travel back everymonth. We are close sweet and everything but yet she just remains as friends because of her job. But I don‚Äôt get the fact that she cares differently and we argue alot when i do small mistakes. She acts like a small baby around me when we are together but texts like so boringly when on the phone. It‚Äôs my first time being with a Vietnamese girl so im still actually learning her culture. Anybody could give any advice?

                              <span>I hate these yellow ugly looking death trap buses of Bao Yen especially line 60A. Both drivers and bus boys have no manners. Always late (1 HOUR wait has become a norm this past 2 weeks) and drive the buses like it&#x27;s a motorbike. On top of that, most have broken ACs or doors won&#x27;t close completely. You can&#x27;t track the buses accurately. Unfortunately VinBuses don&#x27;t pass by Ciputra in Hanoi. I&#x27;d pay 20k for a premium bus experience. 
 Fucking Bao Yen.

                              <span>I went to a public pool with my nephew yesterday, it was very crowded. And at the kid&#x27;s pool area, I could notice that it&#x27;s much harder for me to find a kid being in shape than to find a kid who&#x27;s not. Almost every little kids I saw carried a big belly with them. There&#x27;re so many adults who are overweights too.
 I know that one public pool with max of 100 people isn&#x27;t exactly great of a sample size to draw conclusion for millions of Vietnamese. But it does raise some concern, because in my experience, Vietnamese parents don&#x27;t really care much about diets, calories and nutrions. They all thought the fatter the kids, the better, and subsequently trying to feed them as much as possible. And if they aren&#x27;t gaining in size and being underweigh, it&#x27;s not their &quot;growing up times&quot; yet. Fast foods aren&#x27;t really that popular, I think, so we can&#x27;t blame it on them
 I was 173cm, 45kg for most of my childhood, throughout my earlier years, my parents and relatives has kept telling I&#x27;m not at my &quot;time&quot; yet, and kept taking me to doctors and they weirdly said the same, not &quot;my time&quot; yet. Turned out at 22 years old, I was still that skinny. It&#x27;s not until I decided to eat like hell and learn nutrions did I gained 10kg in 2-3 months. They complmented me saying I&#x27;m finally &quot;at my time&quot;, no I just ate like crazy.

                              <span>I was going through the luggage scanner and I got pulled over by the lady for no reason. My luggage just had my clothes and random shampoo and body care stuff for my family. My Vietnamese is pretty good but not good enough to understand what she was trying to pull me over for. I remember my uncle saying something like if they give me a hard time just give them $20. I literally gave her $20 and she‚Äôs like no it‚Äôs $50. And to shove it discreetly in the drawer for her. I didn‚Äôt carry that much cash with me and was planning to withdraw some from the ATM. And I didn‚Äôt like how that lady was threatening me so I called my aunt. My aunt told me to ask her for the citation receipt and she said she was trying to help me but we can do it the ‚Äúhard way‚Äù and I have to pay $200 wtf. My aunt wanted to speak to her and she told me to hang up and refused to talk to my aunt and told me I‚Äôm a grown adult to take care of it myself. Luckily my aunt knew someone in the airport and he spoke to them and they let me go without paying anything. I wasn‚Äôt annoyed they do shady stuff like that, I was annoyed how she spoke to me!
 Edit - I‚Äôd also like to point out that scanner lady is a complete moron because she asked for my passport and didn‚Äôt flip to the right page with all my info. She pretended to be all official demanding my documentations.

I knew immediately when I wanted treatment that I would never get it from any big or small general hospital. I found one that specialized in mental health and was able to get &quot;what I need&quot;. Which means pills and an affirmation that I have what I suspect I have, nothing more. Still, that was better than other people&#x27;s stories. One person shared that they were publicly mocked by the doctor in the mental health department of B·∫°ch Mai for their suicidal tendency. My God, what the fk!
 Horribly, I told my parents, who were not equipped to handle this, so they reacted &quot;unhelpfully&quot;.

                              <span>As a Vietnamese, I notice this. And it not that long ago, just from our grandfather gerenation, France, US, Japan, China. But in our daily like we don&#x27;t hold grudges or actively say hateful thing toward the nation and it people from the invaders day. Like in our daily life we still talk about them with no hate feeling and very neutral. Except for China, China still actively messing with us and have not give up. Even though, our economy is greatly effect, reply on China we aware of them.
 That my perspective as Vietnamese live our daily life. So what other nation is like, because it seems like China still hate Japan, media about Japan and protry Japan as bad where china kick their ass still very popular til today. From Japan media, it seem like Japan still effects by some contract with the US but from some Japanese movie it seem like also protray Japan have their sin. And worst of all is racist thing in America, black still hate white af and still think they are oppressed today. This remind me how different that is in Vietnam, because we also have minority. If you live in some era where you can still see some local people living among us, they look actually very different than the usual Vietnam people, some also have really dark skin and different hair, if you look in too school system there are also advance thing you can get if you are &quot;Dan toc thieu so&quot; (Wait a minutes, we too have black people). And if you take a look at history, we totally invaded them local, But we are never have racism or hear of them, Now they are one of us. We hate no one, except 36, which is by their own reputation so...

                              <span>Hi all, as a tourist about to visit Vietnam, I am planning on checking out the jewlery market scene. I read that tourists cannot leave the country if they have over 300g of gold without getting permission from the State Bank. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has gone through this experience with gold, or other precious metals like silver?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen several people asking about how to send money from the U.S. or Canada to Vietnam, so I thought I should put together this tutorial.
 And I can&#x27;t believe that not enough folks are taking advantage of the promotion Remitly is running.
  
Pay zero fees on your first transfer. Get $20 off your first transfer when you send $100 or more.
  
The math: Send $100 from the U.S. to a Vietnamese bank account, cash pickup location, or home delivery, and it will only cost you $80. Remitly will cover the other $20. Oh, and there is no fee!
 So here we go...
 Step 1: Click here to sign up for a Remitly account (click the green &quot;Send Now&quot; button).
 Step 2: Enter your email address and password.

I am currently in a medical student in the U.S. Im Vietnamese-American, U.S. citizenship. I speak fluent English and Vietnamese. For a variety of reasons both family and personal aspirations, I am looking to do my medical residency in Vietnam after completing medical school in the U.S. After this I plan on going to Vietnam to do my residency.
 I know this is an odd route, going against the tide of people trying to into U.S. residency. 
 I just have a couple of questions 
 Are there institutions that accept foreign medical students for residency? 
 How much is the tuition? 
 Are residents paid if so around how much? 
 What is the typical length of resid‚Ä¶</span>

 Scary silence. Cheerful Darkness. Sans Chaos ..... HCMC, Vietnam
 Even the most chaotic corner of the city , where I&#x27;m holed up in my my current Chaos Haven, slowly slips into scary silence , as the hour hand moves farther and farther from 12. 
 Standing on the balcony I feel what Edvard Munch may have, before The Scream. Scary Silence . Cheerful Darkness

                              <span>Hi 
 Me and my 10 year old son are planning to travel to Vietnam for Christmas holiday. We plan to fly to Hanoi (4 days) . Then we have 10 more days. We were planning to visit Ha long and stay there on rest of the days but I realised december is chilly. Then I accept to pay for another flight to Ho chi Min city to be closer to the beaches but I read here about Vung Tau, water is brownish and full of garbage. 
 I checked some list of beaches but some beaches can be more suitable for surfers. I want to avoid them. There is never a clear info which beach is suitable for which purpose
 Do you have any idea where can we go for swimming for a week from Hanoi or Ho Chi Min city easily?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I am from central EU and I am looking for a new place to live in for few years.
 Is it hard to get visa in Vietnam, is Vietnam safe to live in, what is the average cost of living in medium populated city?

                              <span>Just after I booked via Booking.com (flexible rate, which I guaranteed with my credit card details) I got a message via Booking and received the following information, among others:
 PAYMENT TERMS: Since reservations via Booking.com are not yet PAID, so the payment must be PAID in Full in ADVANCE before the travel date. Basing on real past customers&#x27; experience and due to the busy and tight schedule and limitation of internet / 3gb connection in Halong bay to guarantee a smoothly trip we require the customer to make the payment completely in advance to avoid these common issues/ problems which will affect seriously your precious time with us such as: Unsuccessful payment due to the internet connection. Being stressful and confused about the payment method after the trip. Problem with customer own credit card (Invalid card, insufficient funds) Since credit card charging is no longer our payment method, we will send you the Invoice via Secured Online Payment Link: Just complete your payment by using VISA/ MASTER and JVC card (2.8 % bank charges)
 And, after asking something:
 ‚ÄúThe card info that you provide on booking is just to ensure booking, It doesn&#x27;t charge any amount. Guests will pay via a Government secured link, and we guarantee that you just pay One time for the trip, Never Double charge Do you have whatsapp to contact you better?‚Äú
 Is this common practice of handling a payment and I am too sceptical? It sounds a bit suspicious to me and I have booked a few other hotels for this trip but have not received such a payment method / request.
 Appreciate your help!!

                              <span>This comes from my experience taking care of my sister. She tried to commit suicide by overdosing on paracetamol, and she was obviously rushed to the hospital. The hospital was Bach Mai Hospital, which I heard was one of the best hospitals in the country. It made me more shocked when, even in the best hospital, I heard a lot of people and even one of the doctors talk about how suicidal people should not be allowed to receive treatment. &quot;Because they want to die anyway.&quot; they say. It was infuriating because my sister could also hear them. She even commented about it, saying she agreed. She wasn&#x27;t in her right mind, and it makes me so upset that people could say such a thing in front of a patient. I know Vietnam still wasn&#x27;t very knowledgeable about mental health, but it wasn&#x27;t even about that. It&#x27;s about a person&#x27;s life; even if they want to take their own life, you are not to treat them differently. It&#x27;s sickening.

                              <span>Hey!
 I‚Äôve been in Vietnam for about two months now and I‚Äôm currently sat having a coffee on the Walking Street. One of the buildings across the road started throwing what looks like money and rice off the roof and everyone started yelling and scrambling to grab the notes. There‚Äôs now a crowd (with people running up the street to join) and it looks like they are handing out money.
 I was just wondering if anyone could explain what‚Äôs happening?
 Thanks :)
 Edit: this is in HCMC as I realised I didn‚Äôt add that before. The building is a guest house but the ground floor is covered in yellow flowers and flags so may be a religious site

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to add that things are rarely black and white, and parents rarely abuse their children for their own pleasures.
 Most parents genuinely love their children and family. And you can see that they themselves are victims of toxic parenting and they themselves suffer from the mental trauma that they don&#x27;t know. We can try to convince them that their way of parenting is wrong but with generations upon generations of trauma and &quot;tradition brainwashing&quot; (so to speak), coupled with the lack of Vietnamese language resources, it&#x27;s really hard for them to realize that the traditional way of parenting is damaging to the mental health of their children.
 So it&#x27;s up to us the younger generations who are equipped with better knowledge to break the cycle, be more understanding to our children at the same time try to fix our own mental trauma so that we don&#x27;t fall into the old ways.

 Kind greetings from Ireland.
 I am an Irish American man in my mid twenties. I am currently considering relocating to Vietnam in early 2024 for a minimum of 1 year. I am considering teaching either or both PE (physical education) and English. Currently I have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Exercise science and I am shortly die to complete my masters in strength and conditioning. I also have TEFL 120hrs certificate. 
 I don&#x27;t have any specific question, I am more just looking for advice and insight to what life could potentially be like for me.

 I‚Äôm a huge history fan, and I have studied Vietnamese history for many years.
 Soon I idol be visiting Vietnam for the second time, and I would love to know where I can go to buy antiques in Vietnam. I‚Äôm not interested in replicas. Especially war replicas. I will be in many different cities. I have heard there are certain ‚Äúif you know where to go‚Äù places you can get some nice antiques, so I would love to know where to look.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at traveling to Northern VietNam (Hanoi) in December. For some context, I live in Canada, will be traveling solo, and am looking at going through a couple weeks. 
  
After doing some research, it seems that one of the biggest challenges is getting around VietNam. Alot of posts say the best way to get around is by motorcycle, however I don&#x27;t have a motorcycle license nor do I know how to ride a motorcycle. With motorcycle out of the picture, what is the next best way to get around?
 One thing I&#x27;ve found from traveling to other places is you save $$$ when you book tours through the street vendors and not through the airline/travel agency. Are there street vendors in VietNam that you can walk up to and book a tour right then and there, or is it better to book them beforehand? I&#x27;ve seen a few websites selling travel excursions in VietNam.
 Almost all the excursions to Ha Long Bay I&#x27;ve found include an overnight cruise. Being December (one of the worst months for rough seas) and someone who gets sea sick easily, is it possible to go on a boat for a few hours and head back to Hanoi on the same day? Or is it better to spend the night somewhere around Ha Long Bay?
 What would be a good way to get to Sa Pa? Google says it&#x27;s ~5 hours by car and ~7 hours by train. Similar to Ha Long Bay, is it recommended/possible to stay in Sa Pa overnight?
 Any other recommendations?

                              <span>Me and my Gf are visiting Vietnam in November. I myself really want to do the Ha giang loop but gf is very hesitant. I have a little to none motorcycle experience but she has not (we skate and cycle tho so we&#x27;re pretty agile, also plan on maybe practice a bit on a motorcylce there and see how comfortable we are). Is it do-able or really as bad as they say? My way of thinking is just that if the road gets tricky we&#x27;ll just slow down take our time and watch out, or even do part by foot. If it&#x27;s just not possible to do it on a motorbike, can you do it by car or (part) on foot, is it still worth it then?

                              <span>Apparently Uber drivers can‚Äôt see where the rider‚Äôs going until they accept the ride and I wonder if this is the case for Grab too? 
 I‚Äôm asking as I want to travel from Da nang to Hoi an and I worry it might leave the driver ‚Äústranded‚Äù if he doesn‚Äôt find a customer on his way back. It‚Äôll cost roughly 350k dong for the 40min-1hr trip (one way) and it‚Äôd make me feel somewhat better if I knew the driver has a choice in his choosing of rides

                              <span>As title says my daughter is starting a trip in SEA in HCMC and is arriving at midnight. I&#x27;ve travelled extensively through SEA but that was over 20 years ago and I am a male. Should she be concerned of being overwhelmed trying to figure out how to find her Grab ride and everything coming at her before getting her bearings ? What can I get her to do to make it easier and safer if anything?
 Thanks, from concerned Dad.

                              <span>And by that I mean the dish you can order everyday (from almost any restaurant) and it will be fresh and full of flavor?
 So far the dishes that seem to do this for me are
  
Bun cha
 Banh Mi
 Sometimes Pho or Bun Bo Hue
  
I know I&#x27;m missing out on some classic dishes that are always delicous. Please help! I live in Saigon btw. 
 I also like beef salad. But when I get chicken salad the chicken is so hard to chew it&#x27;s not working for me.

                              <span>I‚Äôm looking to sell a Diamond ring. My mom suggested I sell it when I go back to Vietnam vs selling while I‚Äôm in the the US. She says I‚Äôll get more money that way. I‚Äôm a little nervous about getting ripped off because its very obvious I‚Äôm a foreigner. Would I even get more money? Also if I wanted to buy a jewelry while I‚Äôm there, how often do you get sold fakes? I know nothing about jewelry and I feel like I could easily get dupped. Maybe I‚Äôm just too suspicious but she seems to think I‚Äôd get more of my moneys worth in Vietnam.

                              <span>I am hoping to travel to Vietnam mid to late February. I know tet is on the 10th so I‚Äôm wondering what traveling will be like in the week or so after that? I have read that Tet occurs for 9 days but have also seen that it could be longer so am hoping to get some insight on it. Will tours and resturaunts still be operating or will things still be pretty shut down? Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi. I am travelling to Vietnam for 1 month in october. I have had all the vaccines my government says are essential, but there are some that are up to yourself to determine if you need them. These are the vaccines for rabies, japanese encephalitus and malaria. I tried asking in travel forums, but they say &quot;ask your doctor&quot;, which I obviously already have, but it is up to me to determine these three on my own.
 What do you think is necessary? I am travelling throughout the country, National Parks, trekking in the northern region, but mostly tourist places.

                              <span>Once a guy tried to sell me some boxing classes. I said i have a certain weight goal in mind. He said its impossible because i have kids, which i dont, he just assumes that base on my age.
 Today i went to a spa for a free facial treatment, the girl of course tried to sell me the package. By the end she said after the treatment you gonna look so beautiful im gonna introduce someone to you. Like i cant get a guy by myself or i need to change anything about myself to get a guy. I talked to another girl earlier i said im not sure i want to have kids, she said im so short sided.
 They are sales people, they need to focus on the product, not people personal life. There are zillion reasons why someone is where they are. If you dont know dont just make assumptions. I know the culture is nosy but assumption is not the answer.

                              <span>Most men I&#x27;ve met and talked to disapproved of them, saying that they&#x27;re way too effeminate. 
 Do most Vietnamese men hold the same opinion? I mean, Vietnam, or any Asian country for that matter, is heavily affected by Korea entertainment industry. Korea, in itself, is a kingdom and trend-setter in terms of entertainment and beauty, it&#x27;s no doubt we are somewhat influenced by them. Most of our hairstyles, or fashion styles, right now follows what&#x27;s trendy in Korea, which would affect what Vietnamese choose to wear and what clothes are produced and promoted for men fashion. 
 I&#x27;ve heard Vietnamese men complaining complaining endlessly on Facebook too, wondering why women likes such girly boys. But I think if they don&#x27;t have any appeal at all to women, they won&#x27;t be that successful and loved. Maybe what men thinks women find attractive is drastically different than what women actually find attractive.
 For me, as a gay men and somewhat masculine, I find half of them very pleasing to the eyes, very &quot;pretty&quot;, the other half too effeminate for my taste. They are &quot;beautiful&quot;, but not &quot;hot.&quot; But it depends on which idol though, some has a perfect blend of masculinity and feminity, of handsomeness and gracefulness that makes them hotter than any 6-packs Western bros.
 Do Vietnamese men like the image of male K-pop idols?

 Backstory: I am not Vietnamese, don&#x27;t have Vietnamese family and look European/American. A few years ago I met some Vietnamese friends in high school and my became interested in the country, culture and language. Last summer i came to Ho Chi Minh for two months to take Vietnamese classes (I am a university student so I came during my break), had a great time and met really nice people. I wasn&#x27;t planning on coming back this summer but things worked out and I am back in Ho Chi Minh for a month, continuing my vietnamese classes.
 A friend that I met last summer and saw a few times the past two weeks, &quot;May&quot;, invited me to her hometown this weekend for independence day weekend. She lives in the Mekong Delta River Region and said that she wanted me t‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never understood people&#x27;s obsession with having a son, a male heir. My father, for example, abandoned his previous wives because they couldn&#x27;t bring him a son. It was not until my mother, and not until having 5 daughters prior to having me, did he have a son.
 But sadly, that son, which is me, is gay. Don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s ironic? The way my father was obsessed with having a son, and he turned out to be gay? I guess it&#x27;s his karma. Never mind, he abandoned my mother too and he has never existed to me in my mind.
 It&#x27;s just that a family in my neighborhood, who are really poor, they have three young daughters already and they&#x27;re still pushing for another one in hope it&#x27;s a boy. Watching the mother with a big belly and three daughters already barely having enough to eat and study pains my heart. 
 Why the obsession with having to have a boy? Um, he could be gay, you know? He could be a transgender. He could die young? He could be a drug addict and a failure, in which case you must have 3 or 4 sons in case then?

                              <span>In the midst of crazy public holiday traffic last night I jumped out of a Grab when I could not knowing my phone slipped from me while doing so, and by the time I realised and ran back he was gone. As a solo traveller it was daunting to think what I should do and what I couldn&#x27;t do without my phone. Trying not to panic, I went to the nearby security guard of a mall. He understood the gist of what I said and took me to the mall information desk. Now, I assumed in the crowded noisy and busy place they would just wave me away and say go to the police station or something. But they jumped into action, got my details and number (thank f*** I had my Vietnam phone number written down seperately on hand), took my photo and messaged security to go over CCTV to try to get the car plate number, let me use their phone to see if I could get any Grab details from my email, and kept calling my phone when they could. 
 The CCTV couldn&#x27;t get a plate number. I feared the driver wouldn&#x27;t hear my phone or would just keep it, but eventually the driver answers. He had finished for the day but would drive back, although it would take time with all the traffic. I expected he would want a compensation for time and fuel and honesty, but when he eventually arrived he refused the cash in my hand. I made him accept a bag of those holiday moon cake things the mall was selling as a thank you, and I also went back and bought a couple for the information desk ladies afterwards. 
 This is a simple faith in humanity restored post because I feared the worst and was touched by how much they cared, especially at such a busy working time for them, for some tourist. Caring for others makes a difference.

                              <span>We are in Da Nang for a few months and just outside the city there‚Äôs a good beach spot along the highway just past the Lady Buddha. There is a man there who charges you to park your scooter on the shoulder of the highway. Is this normal? Seems strange we are paying a random guy (no uniform or signage anywhere) to park on the side of a public road. Appreciate any help!

                              <span>Even in the US, comedy shows of Ali Wong often recognize the superiority of Chinese and denigrate the Vietnamese as &#x27;jungle people&#x27;. I hear this term a lot. Even from Chinese kids who grew up or were born in the US. In fact, I actually hear a lot more disgusting racial slurs directed at Vietnamese by Chinese than just &#x27;jungle people&#x27;.
 Chinese ain&#x27;t that tall and their scrawny looking military appears extremely funny versus the US. So why the hate? Explain.

                              <span>I just ordered on the website since there was a sale going on for the product i wanted.
 It seems to have a bad reputation since i have seen a lot of people online saying that they lost their product or that the carrier says it is just updating tracking and there being fake or poor quality products on the website, most of them i see from mostly old comments and posts from 3-5 years ago, usually with not much proof than just words, can anyone reassure me on this?

                              <span>Im sure this is often posted on here but during my travels of Vietnam with my partner next February we are debating doing a Ha Long Bay cruise?
 They seem expensive so trying to figure out if it‚Äôs worth it. Lots of research I‚Äôve done so far highlights the trash and the fact it‚Äôs a massive tourist trap.
 What do people think? We are English, I‚Äôve travelled a lot and her not so much. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I will be arriving in your beautiful country tomorrow as the last stop on a business trip. I will fly out again Thursday morning. Unfortunately I&#x27;ll be working most days, and probably taken out to dinner in the evening. Is there anything I can/should buy and have shipped to the hotel, that would be guaranteed to arrive by Wednesday to make sure I get it before leaving? Anything from candies, to souvenirs, gifts for my wife, etc. Ideally links would be great too! I&#x27;ll be in Saigon if that makes any difference. 
 Thanks so much in advance!

I have a degree in engineering and also a few year‚Äôs experience and recommendations would be great for me and would appreciate it. How do i get a company maybe that pays in USD if that‚Äôs possible.

                              <span>These people live maybe a few years in Nam, get stepped on in a crowded elevator at rush hour and scream &#x27;selfish culture&#x27; at the top of their lung. They get cut on the road by other bikes at rush hour where everyone just want to get home in a traffic jam and scream. 
 While those behavior can be labeled selfish, they made up one small part of one side of the knife. People will go out of their way to hold the elevator door open for me everyday, and im a man. If you ran out of gas and pushing your bike on the road, it wont take long until someone stop and ask, even drive off and buy you a can. 
 It&#x27;s not to say Vietnamese people are not selfish for doing those thing. It&#x27;s to say they act on the polar opposite on different circumstance. So those examples doesnt really say anything about the culture itself.

 No wonder everyone&#x27;s depressed these days (from B·∫°ch Mai hospital statistic, there&#x27;s an average of 40000 suicides each year in Vietnam) and nobody wanna give birth, generational trauma carry on through generations.

                              <span>Hello, I am currently having a grand time in Vietnam and will be here for another week. I take this supplement called Betaine HCl which is just stomach acid for digestion. I&#x27;m not gonna die if I run out but boy does it help with digestion and the farts. 
 So far I have visited several Pharmacies and saw other supplements but not this one.
 Does anyone know? Thank you for your help.

                              <span>So, I am in Hanoi and I noticed the flags and posters everywhere saying something will happen on september 2nd. Looked it up and it&#x27;s the Vietnam&#x27;s National Independence Day. Very cool!
 Last night was super busy in the city, with all the streets closed off, wasn&#x27;t expecting that (cause it&#x27;s the night before?) but it was nice. My guidebook states that there is a parade with fireworks somewhere, but my host wasn&#x27;t aware of this. Maybe you guys know? It&#x27;ll be my last day in Vietnam so it would be nice to end it off with some celebration.

I really enjoy sitting outside with a cold one while people watching here in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve been drinking Heineken 0.0 but would like a little variety. Has anyone run across any othe non-alcoholic beer options here in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hello Vietnam! How much should I really pay for buying shoes? (Nike or Onitsuka) from the market? I think anywhere where between 300K- 400K is good enough. All shopkeepers pushing for 800K, what do you suggest?

                              <span>I will land in Saigon on 7th Sept early morning.
 I have around 21-22 days. Plannint to fly out of Hanoi. 
 I want to explore the major places, I know, its not possible to explore this big country in just 3 weeks.
 Plan is to see HCMC, Museums, Cu chi tunnel. Explore the street food. Then visit da nang/Hoi an and do activities there. Bana hills, eat good food. 
 Then move to Hanoi. Then Ninh bin. 1 day trip to Lan ha bay. 2 days to Sapa fom Hanoi. 
 I am not going to Ha xiang region. Just want to see Sapa.
 I want to try the sleeper night trains from Saigon to Danang. Is it worth or better to book the flight or bus? Are the buses comfortable enough to sleep?
 Also, please tell me which bank ATM has zero cost on cash withdrawal?
 If I purchase eletronic items like Phone/Drone etc, will I get VAT refund at the airport? How much vat refund can I get ?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Was wondering if any expats have gone through an IVF procedure in Vietnam and willing to talk about it? We&#x27;re deciding on whether to go through the process but cost is a major issue. In the US it costs $30k per procedure. We&#x27;ve considered either going back to France where IVF can be done for $5k or Vietnam. I&#x27;ve seen VN fertility clinics that will do the procedure for $3k to $5k. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>This is a serious question. Because this salary is not low, it is too low. It is even lower than the salary of low-skilled workers. Only $200/month? Prime Minister $600/month (To avoid the situation where many people say that salaries in many countries are also low). How to live with this salary? Or do you simply love your job or love your country so choose it?
 Please answer honestly.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been here a while and when I drink with Vietnamese they put me under the table. Knowing the cities are full of beer bucket spots and people drinking outside I take it not everyone is using grab. Question is, on a good weekend at night are there a lot of drunk people on the road? Or do they head home a with a sober guy in the group?

                              <span>I&#x27;m from the States.. my mother is from the south and immigrated here in the early 80s. Fast forward to present day and my son who&#x27;s 5, needs his tonsils removed. 
 My mom referred to them as amidan. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve heard this term used since I was a kid and as an adult now I&#x27;m curious.. was this also one of those borrowed words from the French?
 There are plenty of examples of words that were from the French and I was curious if this was one of them. Amidan to me just doesn&#x27;t sound Viet.. but hey.. I could be wrong.

I‚Äôm mixed viet and white, while I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm connected enough to get citizenship (grandmother is viet, I‚Äôm 1/4) we still keep in contact with family and visited 2013. I feel happier when I‚Äôm with my viet family, I feel more at home with them than in the US, and am welcome to live with them when I am there (I think this is legal if I register with police). We are visiting soon again and I will consult people when I visit but was wondering if I‚Äôd be able to take some capital from the US and open a business over there. It seems like you have to invest a certain threshold, aka be a big time corporate investor where I‚Äôm trying to start a smaller business. I would appreciate the inputs.

                              <span>Hi, me and my band are arriving in Ho Chi Minh city soon for a tour, and I need find a place in Ho Chi Minh city to pick up a cheap baritone ukulele. I can&#x27;t use a soprano, concert or tenor for this, I need the big one ;)
 Thanks

                              <span>Are you shocked? I remember once having a friend from Saigon come over when it was both the coldest time of the year and also the rainiest. Anyone having lived in the North would know how suck it is when it&#x27;s both bone-chilling cold and rains heavily.
 Let&#x27;s say, he came unprepared. He was shocked and scarred for life, lol. His expectation of what&#x27;s considered cold was vastly different to how cold it was actually. He barely brought any practical jackets to keep himself warm.

                              <span>So.. when I landed at HCMC airport I bought a viettel sim with unlimited data along with a bunch of other foreigners who had just landed. It supposedly comes with 100mins of call time and unlimited data for 30 days.
 I haven‚Äôt had any issue with it so far and been getting by without connecting to the wifi once but I‚Äôm now reading that unlimited data plan doesn‚Äôt exist? 
 I thought I got a pretty good deal and would like to renew if possible but now I‚Äôm confused what plan it even was that I got

                              <span>Hi all,
 Currently in Phu Quoc and looking for some recommendations for good seafood! My partner hasn&#x27;t really had any decent seafood in her life so figured this would be a good opportunity. 
 Any recommendations for good restaurants and dishes to try? (Crab, squid, fish are safe options.) Thank you!

                              <span>So my guy friend just had his left ear pierced and as a joke I said why didn‚Äôt you get both sides done. He was told apparently by the piercer not to get the right ear pierced unless he wants to indicate to others his homo sexuality. Suddenly I started noticing other guys having left ear piercings (and not gay). Coincidence? Or is that a real thing here in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m curious and just wanted to hear more about how English teachers in Vietnam felt and managed while in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve selected Vietnam as my first teaching destination.
 -Monthly income? What did you actually make as an entry level teacher?
 -How many days did you really work each week? Was it exhausting? Start time &amp; End time.
 -I plan to take Vietnamese language classes during my free time. Will I have time outside of work for languages classes?
 -What&#x27;s the most efficient way to learn Vietnamese from scratch? I know its extremely difficult to learn. My goal is to at least be about to speak like a Vietnamese toddler after 1.5 years of practice.
 I&#x27;m also very introverted and at times a little closed off. I just have to fight that habit I have of isolating myself. Idk why I love alone time so much haha. But overall I have positive interactions with almost everyone and Im pretty approachable. I hope to come across people from all walks of life while in Vietnam. My parents are Nigerian but I was born in America so I got to experience two cultures growing up. I just love learning about other cultures.
 Lastly, how&#x27;s dating/making friends scene in Vietnam?? I would like a social life. 
 Is a long term stay feasible as an English teacher in Vietnam? Or at all as an English&#x27;s teacher. I do hold a Masters degree, Im hoping that helps with future promotions after I gather more teaching experience. What do you think?
 I&#x27;m also a Registered Nurse in America. Im 35 years old. Im 6&#x27;3 and Black. Would I do best in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh?
 Advice, honest opinions and experiences are all welcomed.

                              <span>Hi all - I am travelling to Vietnam soon and have an allergy* to pork (*sensitivity - it makes me extremely sick but now life threateningly so) and I was wondering how easy it is to avoid eating it as I understand it is commonly eaten. I figure I can stick to seafood and vegetarian options, but wondered if anyone had experience trying to eat halal or kosher (as I know both these follow a strict &#x27;no pork&#x27; criteria) while in Vietnam.
 Thanks in advance :)

 Edit: Thank you to everyone who has offered advice. It&#x27;s been extremely helpful as I was really worried I would be limited in experiencing the delicious cuisine. I will be taking u/meh2280 on his suggestion that bun cha is worth it - I just got some meds from the doc so I can limit my diarrhea to just a day or two and only eat it on days where we will be staying around our accommodation and relaxing! haha sorry if that was TMI. 
 Special thanks to those of you who also translated some food names into english for me. This is going to serve me well. I can&#x27;t wait to go to Vietnam! :)

                              <span>I traveled in Vietnam in 1996. It was an amazing, awe inspiring trip. I have nothing but good things to say about its people, landscape and food. (Okay, the roads were a little on the rough side.) I wish I could reach out to those who I spent time with like Flower and Ahn (?) in Hanoi, Lan in Hoi An and my soccer buddies in Hue. I hope to return one day.

                              <span>I am traveling to Vietnam later this year and I‚Äôm hoping to get some recommendations. I will arrive in Ho Chi Minh City on November 1st and I plan to spend 2-3 days there. Then I would like to explore the southern part of the country for about a week. Hoping to get recommendations for anything South or West of the city. Cultural attractions, food, beaches, or whatever. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I arrive late in Hanoi, is there any currency exchange available so I can convert USD to VND? My US bank (wells fargo) doesnt convert to VND anymore for some reason and am not sure where I can exchange prior to my arrival to Hanoi. Was wondering if the currency exchange at the airport is open 24/7 as I will want some currency at least once I arrive. What are my options for getting VND?

This is shared in my family group chat and tons of other viet relatives liked the shared video. I told them that it‚Äôs not funny, the dog was clearly scared and the man was being abusive (about to hit them with a sandal), and they told me I‚Äôm being too sensitive, that it‚Äôs only a joke‚Ä¶
 Why do viet people have such shit sense of humor though‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve recently been looking into writing a nation inspired by Vietnam but I‚Äôm honestly having a really hard time getting the ball rolling. So I figured I‚Äôd ask here for any suggestions on reading on history and mythology as well as maybe just random ideas to help get the ball rolling. Thank you for your time!

 I saw some people spraying in Hanoi earlier today and they told me I can do it on the wall near the Waterpark in T√¢y H·ªì but I saw its filled with really nice murals and I don&#x27;t really wanna spray over them üòÇ I&#x27;ve only done this once before so I am just looking for an ugly ass wall where I can practice making ugly drawings
 Also would be interested in creating paste-ups (posters), what are the regulations on those? Can I get in trouble if I paste some art on walls around the city?

                              <span>So, me being gay, got invited to a party with a friend. That friend of mine spotted someone we both know, that person had gotten a new haircut and it&#x27;s very trendy and flattering on him
 My friend said, look at him! I only said back &quot;ƒê·∫πp trai!&quot; My friend then gave me a very weird look, then saying that don&#x27;t ever use &quot;ƒê·∫πp trai&quot; to compliment a guy, we are only allowed to use &quot;Ng·∫ßu&quot;.
 Which is weird to me. Maybe I&#x27;m being gay so I&#x27;m not used to the normal customs and etiquettes between guys and guys. Maybe I see no problem with it but many do. Is it socially unacceptable for Vietnamese men to compliment each other using &quot;ƒê·∫πp trai&quot;, or that word is just avoided and reserved for only women to use to compliment a guy?

                              <span>When I last visited SGN in 2019, being my first time, I got caught in the shoe shine scam. I thought I was being kind when I let one guy polish and fix my shoe but in the end I got threatened by a group of them with hammers and had to relinquish 500,000d to them. 
 I‚Äôm planning to return soon. How can I avoid being a victim of this scam if they come up to me n polish my shoes again? Do I shoo them away or just resign myself to fate as a tourist in VN? Will the police help if I manage to get their attention? 
 Serious answers please! üôè

                              <span>what&#x27;s the deal with people swarming this sub with shameless seeding posts? afaik these are pretty much against the rules of the sub : no spam, no self-promotion, etc.
  
fake account pretending to be a tourist and posting links toward their tourism website
 post contains nothing but a tiktok link with no context
 literally same as above, but youtube link to their own channel
  
this wholesome sub is the last place i want to see people abusing for their own profit

                              <span>Hello. Expat here, living and working in Saigon. Which is the best district where to buy apartment? Near the center prices are literally crazy (D1, D4, D2, D7). Which is the best outer district where to settle? Furthermore, is expected prices to go down a bit in next few years or generally will stay ‚Äòhot‚Äô. Mortgage of banks is a big issue too nowadays, rate around 10% are literally madness to borrow any amount of money. Please give me your opinions

                              <span>Xin ch√†o! I recently started my journey of learning Vietnamese in the northern dialect. I&#x27;ve seen a few different people say that it&#x27;s always helpful to consume some sort of media in your target language to familiarize yourself with the sounds and pronunciation, even if you don&#x27;t understand anything. This of course isn&#x27;t going to be my primary method of studying but I&#x27;m sure it would be a useful tool, especially with English subtitles but that isn&#x27;t a requirement. Does anyone have suggestions for something I could use that is mainly in the northern accent? I can listen to podcasts/radio shows at work, or it could be content creators or TV shows/movies for in my free time. I would appreciate any ideas! C·∫£m ∆°n (:

                              <span>Hello everyone. I just bought a ticket for my mother to fly from Vietnam to the US. I‚Äôm staying in the States so this ticket is bought in United Air website, fly with ANA Japan. 
 Here is the issue I have. My mother name Anh Thi Nguy·ªÖn which Anh is first name and Nguy·ªÖn is her last name. On her passport and Visa, it says Given Name Thi Anh and last name is Nguy·ªÖn, so combined is Thi Anh Nguy·ªÖn. 
 When I booked, I put last name Nguy·ªÖn, first name Anh, middle name Thi, ticket comes out with traveler name is Anh Thi Nguy·ªÖn. 
 I found out I cannot change anything. Will this be an issue when she flies with custom? 
 Thank you everyone.

 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a white guy (Ukranian ancestry and American born) and live in Southern California and I recently rented a room from a Vietnamese family. Very nice people, I&#x27;ve only spoken to them briefly but they seem really nice and it&#x27;s a great room and beautiful, quiet house!
 The wife of the family has been hard with me though...they were renting a room to somebody before that was there for 6 years, and I&#x27;m &quot;the new renter&quot; and she has been getting on my case for stuff that&#x27;s pretty obviously just to give me a hard time and probably to test me a bit and see how I&#x27;ll react perhaps? I&#x27;m not sure. She keeps telling me that if she doesn&#x27;t like me that she&#x27;ll just tell her husband and that they won&#x27;t let me live there. 
 The husband has been very laid back for the most part, it seems like she is just testing me somewhat and wants to make sure I&#x27;m a nice person and a good renter. 
 Anyway, I wanted to ask is there some kind of gift I can get for her or the family that would show my appreciation to the family for renting the room? I&#x27;m fairly new to SoCal which has a large Vietnamese population as I&#x27;m sure you know, and I&#x27;d like to get the something as a housewarming gift and to show my appreciation.
 Thanks in advance, much appreciated!

                              <span>During our stay in Vietnam, when we were asked where we come from, we noticed some curious pattern:
 -Greece
 -[questioning look]
 -Hy Lap
 -Aaaah, Hy Lap. Pyramids!
 -No, that is Egypt. We are the others, the ones with the columns. XD
 So, most usually people confused Greece with Egypt. It‚Äôs not insulting for us or anything like that but I really wonder why that mix-up was so common. I understand that an obscure, small, rather insignificant country in the other end of the world can be mixed up with other, neighboring countries. But why specifically with Egypt?
 My suspicion is that most Vietnamese have heard of Greece in history class at school. Maybe in chapter &quot;ancient civilizations of eastern Mediterranean&quot;? (That‚Äôs when Greece was thriving)
 Please help me untangle this mystery.

                              <span>Hey everyone, do any of you have specific recommendations for places to visit in the south during mid September? The weather is due to be wet, but it doesn&#x27;t deter me. I will travel from Saigon to Hanoi from September 10-31st and am truly excited. I have plenty of places I&#x27;d like to visit in the middle/north such as Hue, Hoi An, Sapa and Phong Nha. However, I lack destinations in the south that may be worth visiting this time of year, apart from Saigon and Dalat. I have searched for places to visit, but am concerned that they won&#x27;t be too enjoyable in wet weather. Is there anywhere in the south people found particularly beautiful in September? Many thanks in advanceüëç

                              <span>I just arrived this week and there has been some rain here and there. I heard that this can cause wastewater to run off into the beaches. I&#x27;m considering surfing at My Khe Beach but I&#x27;m worried about it being polluted. How is the water quality, should I avoid it since it&#x27;s been raining?

                              <span>just a bit confused about what&#x27;s socially acceptable for couples in public. i&#x27;ve been under the impression that pda is very frowned upon, i&#x27;ve heard even just hugging or holding hands isn&#x27;t great. i&#x27;ve seen many couples that wrap their arms around each other on motos so i figured that was normal, even if they aren&#x27;t holding on for support or safety so much as just a desire. but what about the girls i&#x27;ve seen koala-ing (had both arms and legs wrapped around the guy) their bfs on motos? is that fine? have i been wrong about what slides and what doesn&#x27;t?

                              <span>I am at work today so I gave my family my cards in case they need to buy anything (they come to visit me). I put ¬£1000 on the card. For all days I kept receiving notifications with money caming out from my card. And when contacted them, they informed me that they were buying perfumes, cosmetics and wines.
 The annoying part is that they didn&#x27;t even spend the money for themselves. They spent it to buy souvenirs for people I don‚Äôt even know and they didn&#x27;t even meet once every couple of months. My sister bought gifts for her mother-in-law‚Äôs neighbours, my niece bought gifts for her classmates. I already bought lots of cosmetics and functional foods for my sisters and cousins at home so there isn&#x27;t much they need to buy. I already covered the expenses of the whole trip, so with this It feels like I am even paying for people who didn&#x27;t even do anything for my life.
 The culture of buying gifts for everyone when travelling is something I couldn&#x27;t understand. They didn&#x27;t even contribute one penny when we work our ashes out to afford holiday. Why do we have to buy them gifts when we enjoy the sweet fruit of our labour?

                              <span>I feel like Ao Dao is very flattering on male figures and body shapes. It could hide your skinny frame well if you&#x27;re underweight. It could also hide well your belly fat if you happened to be overweight.
 The only drawback I could think of is the inconveniences and it being impractical? But I feel like the office uniform of white shirt tucked in is not exactly comfortable either, the tucked-in could easily be ruined if you move around too much too

                              <span>I will be traveling around Vietnam for 3 weeks and will be there during the Mid-Autumn Festival. I hear it&#x27;s mostly for children so is it worth it to plan my trip around the holiday or not. What is the best city to be in to experience the festival? I am debating between Hoi An, Hue, or Hanoi.
 Would love to know any other tips or suggestions for the holiday. 
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi, as the title suggests. A bit about myself: I&#x27;m a female located in HCMC and currently working as a Data Analyst. I have a knack for drawing and I&#x27;m working as a freelance 3D artist.
 The game titles I often play:
  
League of Legends (Mostly in Aram mode, I&#x27;ve reached Grandmaster rank as an ADC)
 Valorant
 Honkai Star Rail
 Genshin Impact
 I can play various games on Steam that support co-op mode.
 I&#x27;m fond of narrative-driven games like Cyberpunk 2077, Batman Trilogy, Final Fantasy...
  
I use Discord and I prefer playing games at home.
 I hope to find someone who would like to play with me after stressful working hours. 
 I am indeed a real girl. I&#x27;m not transgender or anything like that. It&#x27;s just that my gaming hobby and skills aren&#x27;t common in my job and profession. I&#x27;m also pursuing a master&#x27;s degree, so I don&#x27;t have time to find gaming buddies. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money to hire gaming partners, but I&#x27;ve realized that those relationships can be quite toxic.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have come to understand that Vietnam has very strict laws against the usage of marijuana, but that these laws are rarely enforced. I am a foreigner - an American, and the situation is much the same in many parts of the country here. In addition to this, there has been a fairly constant push amongst some people to legalize marijuana here, and it seems likely to me that it will be made federally legal some time in the relatively near future (though I don&#x27;t think the country is quite there yet). I was curious if it is the same for Vietnam - what is the general sentiment on marijuana laws? Do you believe marijuana should be legal in Vietnam, and do you think it will be soon, or do you think the current laws will remain in place for the foreseeable future, and why?

 My brother-in-law (26M) has been dating this Vietnamese girl (27F) for almost a year now. I‚Äôm a Vietnamese myself so it‚Äôs not a racial targeted post.
 Well‚Ä¶ When they first started dating, I‚Äôve noticed some red flags in the stories he told me and my husband about. Since maybe he was just trying to vent to us, I‚Äôm not gonna mention them. But that‚Äôs when I began to have bad feelings about this girl.
 A month or two into them seeing each other, he found out that she‚Äôs actually STILL MARRIED to another man and had a kid with him. When they met up to talk about it, she explained that her husband had a child with another ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I‚Äôm a foodie and would love to eat at Saigon‚Äôs only Michelin starred restaurant on my next trip. However, the Google reviews are rather lackluster. What are the VN foodies thoughts on this place? Normally $80-$125 tasting menu pricing isn‚Äôt that big of a deal in the west, but I feel I can better spend that money elsewhere. I had the million Dong pho from LM81 and thought it was a solid 7/10, but wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to eat there again. 
 Also, how far in advance do I need to make reservations? Thank you.

                              <span>I was happy that this one area has sidewalks for people to walk. I just saw this announcement that parking spaces are going to be designated on sidewalks.
 Looks like they generously spared around 30cm of space between the sidewalk and the grass.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am planning my trip to vietnam next month. I will go with one of my friend which is VN. We will stay in his village (ƒê·ª©c th·∫Øng m·ªô ƒê·ª©c qu·∫£ng Ng√£i)for one week at his parents house.
 Problem is: he told me that in the past the military have forbidden foreingers to stay and sleep the night in this village. Apparently for &#x27;security&#x27; reason because of some military zone nearby. We would have to book hotel nearby and visit his family during the day. Problem is that I do not find any official information on this interdiction and what are the exact restrictions. I would like to know the laws/rules so that I am not putting myself into problems.
 Questions: Are you aware of any official restrictions for foreigners in certain part of vietnam? Any forbiden place or activity related to military area?

                              <span>Hi, everyone!
 I am very excited to be going to Vietnam for the first time on October 5th of this year. I am meeting my best friend who&#x27;s been living in Germany for the last 8 months. It&#x27;s going to be a fairly quick trip, and neither of us knows the best way to go about it.
 As it stands, we are meeting in HCM and we have a total of 16 days before I need to fly back from HCM to Australia on the 21st. Currently, we&#x27;re thinking of spending 8 days in HCM and then another 8 days in Hanoi, as Google says Hoi An will have bad weather. I wouldn&#x27;t mind going to Sapa as that looks good too, but I&#x27;m at a complete loss as to what to do and where to go.
 I have some general concerns as this will be my first time overseas from Australia and im not too sure what to expect. 
 with that out the way the only solid plans I have are landing in HCM on the 5th of Oct and flying out on the night of the 21st. Any advice would be appreciated. Also, I just want to make sure I don&#x27;t make any rookie travel mistakes during that time. I know there are massive differences in weather across the country during that period and Im mostly just looking to find the driest / sunniest place to go that time of year. Apologies in advance im just a bit confused as every website I see gives different advice and wildly different weather predictions. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I‚Äôll admit that living in Korea as an expat has its share of problems too, but it‚Äôs pretty neat for the most part . When I visited Vietnam a month ago, I thought people were mostly friendly, ( although a Belgian traveler I met said that he was denied entry to restaurants on a couple of occasions ) and the country was far more beautiful ( nature ) than I expected. Mostly the countryside in Ninh Binh. How many of you live in the countryside in Vietnam ? Do you enjoy it or does or get boring quick enough ?

                              <span>Hi me (21 F) is interested in a Vietnamese man (24), but am a bit unsure if I want to commit. I‚Äôve been a bit overwhelmed by the volume of communication. I‚Äôm very introverted person and need time alone. Is this level of communication typical in Vietnamese relationships? He is very keen on me committing to the relationship even though I just met him. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm comfortable with this style of relationship. He has respected my boundaries but I do feel overwhelmed and unsure about my feelings for him. What I should expect dating a Vietnamese man? All the guides I see are about foreigners dating a Vietnamese woman.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning on traveling to SEA next year and wondering how long 5 million VND would last me? I&#x27;m planning on buying a motorcycle and sticking around til the money runs out. I&#x27;m thinking HCMC will be my home base. 
 I&#x27;m aware I would need to do a border run every 1/3 months depending on how the visa situation develops. Living somewhat frugally, eating what the locals do, but still having pretty regular nights out on the town.
 Roughly how long do you think I should plan to stay there? Thank
 Edit: I definitely meant to put 500 million, sorry about that folks

                              <span>Need to catch a flight at 7am in Saigon/HCMC, so would need to leave at around 4:30am or 5am latest from District 2. At that time would it be easy to find a Grab around District 2? Prefer a Grab bike since I&#x27;m alone but Grab car would be fine too. Just wondering if it&#x27;s too early to find a driver, thanks!

                              <span>As an (obvious) &quot;western&quot; tourist here, I often have the feeling you cannot walk more than 50 meters without someone approaching you who is after your money (especially in cities). In principle that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s natural that a lot of people earn money from tourists and have to approach them, so I do not mind. However this leads to me getting used to say &quot;no&quot; to basically everyone taking to me. 
 Today I was walking to the post office (~20 min away) in HCMC with postcards in my hand, and someone driving by (regular guy, no grab jacket or anything) stopped and asked if I was looking for the post office and if he could help me. Out of habit I immediately told him no thanks, but afterwards reflected if I was being mean to someone genuinely wanting to help.
 Similar situations happened several times... So my question: am I being naive, is anyone offering help expecting a tip/money anyways? ( I was also asked for money straight away after someone helped me with a minor think taking 20 second, with rather ungrateful response after I gave only 20k.) Or am I being mean to people and assume they are just after money if they are genuinely nice? And how can you tell the difference?
 My common sense from &quot;back home&quot; does not really seem to apply here, hence my questions.

 For the record, I‚Äôve been Googling this for hours. I‚Äôve tried to email, what looks like Vietnamese customs. None of them has answered. 
 Do you guys have any tips? Is it legal? Who should I contact?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m staying in Hanoi for about two months to do research at VAST. Of course I am taking this opportunity to visit as much places as possible here. But since I have so much time I was wondering if there are places worth visiting that are less obvious or well known, that tourists don&#x27;t usually visit because they&#x27;re too far from the center or something like that. Does anyone have recommendations?

From the moment I landed (4.00 am), I am seeing people roaming around with flower bouquets in scooters, this was early morning. Day time when I was roaming hanoi old quarters, I saw many women carrying those white flower bouquets. Is it some occasion? Or it is customary to give your date a bouquet of white flowers?

                              <span>They are so nice and have these big parties where everyone gets very drunk. The grandmothers are there too but they don‚Äôt get drunk. There‚Äôs always tons of food so I don‚Äôt think I should bring food. There‚Äôs always tons of beer so I don‚Äôt think I need to bring that either. Last time I brought some flowers. I keep worrying I might accidentally offend them but they keep inviting me so I don‚Äôt think I have. We live in America. I‚Äôm trying to learn a little Vietnamese but it‚Äôs really difficult‚Äîwill they think it‚Äôs weird if I try to say something in Vietnamese? Edit: I‚Äôm getting the impression that more beer is alway welcome!
 Edit 2: definitely bringing Hennessy and fruit. Probably not bull penis that someone suggested.

                              <span>I am thinking of buying a house now for my Vietnemese girlfriend and baby. How are housing prices now? Are they overpriced? Should I wait or pull the trigger now? Any red flags I should be aware of when looking at houses? I know nothing about construction quality and the overall home purchasing Process . I will be grateful for any constructive feedback.

                              <span>Hi, first time travelling to Hanoi and will be renting a car to drive by myself. I have been looking for hotel options not too far from the old quarter who either have private parking for guests. All the hotels that I have checked out on Agoda that has car park listed as a facility, don&#x27;t really have a parking lot in front when I cross checked them on Google Maps. A bit confused right now on how I should go about searching a hotel that meets this criteria, or alternatively should I be looking at paid parking lots and if those are common in Hanoi. 
 Any suggestion/recommendation is highly appreciated.

                              <span>I have the in-laws over from Vietnam. Very traditional to say the least. I&#x27;m curious where some beliefs come from, like not being able to eat something hot and cold together, one example, eating pho and then ice cream after. Taking a shower after sweating outside. And last was drinking water before or after eating mangos. I tried looking for online for explanation, but don&#x27;t find much other than the mango one being a myth

                              <span>For me, it&#x27;s the best beach I&#x27;ve ever had the chance to visit. But I&#x27;ve only visited Ha Long Bay and Sam Son Beach, and Sam Son has not exactly ever been recommended by anyone, so I think my opinion might be skewed 
 I love visiting Ha Long bay. I, in fact, has been doing it all the times, alone. I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just sentimental reasons though, It&#x27;s just that have treasurable memory there. It was a very difficult time of my life, and someone invited me to go there with them. I remember just lying on the golden sand, gazing my eyes up on the blue blue sky, immerse myself into what felt like just emptyless. A big, blue sky and a boderless sea, just made you felt wanting to melting into them, merging with them, disappear into just some bubbles with them. Just plain peace and tranquillity, some tranquillity I deeply needed that time. It calmed me down, calmed my every torments down.
 From then, I always make chances to go there, just to lie on the golden sand again. I only chose when there would be least tourists, even if that means during a storm season. Storm, brings in another kind of tranquillity. 
 But I&#x27;m afraid I might be biased. I always tell people that in Vietnam, I love Ha Long the most. I&#x27;m afraid the reason I love Ha Long is not for the fact it&#x27;s actually great there. To gaze into the endless sky, any beach would do.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning on visiting Vietnam in the second half of September and want to get an idea of what kind of weather to expect. I tried googling it and got some very different answers so I thought I&#x27;d try asking the people who actually live there. Should I bring gumboots and a raincoat, or boardshorts and sunglasses?
 Is there a noticeable difference in weather between the north/central/south regions?

                              <span>L√ä B√¨nh Giang (1990, Vietnam) was educated in Film at the University of Ho Chi Minh, but he wasn‚Äôt allowed to graduate because the script for his film KFC was considered too violent by the Council of Examiners. L√™ didn‚Äôt give up on his project and tried to find sponsors. He won the Film of the Future Award at the Vietnamese Autumn Meeting 2013, which helped him get started. After making several short films he finally made KFC (2016), his feature film debut, three years later. In 2023, he released two movies, ‚ÄúRock-a-bye Baby‚Äù and ‚ÄúJackpot Island‚Äù

 Is there certain clubs(not partying/drinking clubs) I can join to meet new people? Or online groups or apps to use/download? How does the Vietnamese-American Center in Saigon work? I‚Äôd love to visit.
 Thanks in advance üôè

Is there anything I should be worried about when bringing them back to the states? I only have a script for Klonopin(clonazepam) in the US. I‚Äôd like to bring back 50 Diazepam tablets.
 Also, there will be a layover flight when leaving Vietnam to Taiwan before going back to the states. Will I get any problems at the Taipei airport?
 Would love to hear any experience of traveling back to US with medicine. Thank you all in advance!ü´∂

                              <span>I am viet kieu and my husband is caucasian. We adopted a viet dog /ch√≥ c·ªè/ 2 years ago when she was only 3 months old. The weird thing is whenever my husband takes the dog out for a walk, people ask him if the dog was rescued, especially when the question is directly from the locals. There was also one time the vet in district 2, saigon asked us if we rescued our dog. What are your thoughts on this? Maybe I am missing something or having a viet dog is considered as a rescue act for foreigners here in Vietnam.

                              <span>I know this could be a controversial topic, but I really need to get this out there so we can hear each other&#x27;s opinion.
 I have had a motorbike driving license for 8 years. My bike is reaching 30,000 km traveled intra-city. I&#x27;ve got used to the bustling metropolitan lifestyle.
 But I cannot trust my life on the bike. I&#x27;ve realized my body is out on the open, and each day it&#x27;s like large cars are out there to get me. During rush hour, the sidewalk is the road. I cannot help but feel guilty for pedestrians who should have the right to the sidewalk, but again, my right of way is being violated by the cars too. City traffic IS deadly if you&#x27;re a biker, I cannot say otherwise.
 Why allowing such a risky vehicle to become the nation&#x27;s top chosen transport? Why putting next to none effort in enforcing helmet safety? Why aborting the trolleycars, a totally cool public transport?
 I really need to hear your thoughts.
 Disclaimer: I am not a foreigner. I&#x27;ve lived all my life in Vietnam and married to a third generation Hanoian family, whose members are exclusively chauffered or taking public transport, and advise me to stay out of traffic.

 As u all know, Trump and co-conspirator&#x27;s mugshots were finally released yesterday and i read a report by vnexpress on this and the comment section is absolutely filled with fanatic Trump supporters, which is kinda strange and disturbing to me since i expect an isolationist president like Trump will not gather as much support in foreign countries, not to mention all of the horrible deeds he had done during and after his presidency( covid response and Jan 6th, etc)
 So just how popular is Trump in this country? Are those comments just trolls or actual opinions of actual Vietnameses?

                              <span>Returned home to see my son with a bruise on his head right close to his temple. We asked and he said he bumped into a teacher at school and the teacher slapped him. He‚Äôs dizzy with ear pain now.
 Common solution is to find the teacher and give him a chair on the head, but after the anger subsided I think maybe there could be more civilized way to solve this?
 Plan to take him to the hospital for checkups first thing tomorrow, but anyone has suggestions on what we should do? Google only give vague advices that doesn‚Äôt help much.

                              <span>In many bathrooms, there is a sign that says don&#x27;t put paper in the toilet. Obviously if I&#x27;m dropping a deuce, I use TP.
 These toilets tend to have bad water pressure, so I got to thinking while stinking.
 Am I supposed to: 1. Spray and toss the hopefully dookie-less paper into the bin? 2. Not throw PAPER TOWEL into the toilet, but TP is fair play?
 This has been bothering me for years. 
 This is much more ambiguous than &quot;don&#x27;t stand on the toilet seat&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t spray water into the power outlets&quot;

                              <span>I travel with a family member who has four names, for example, Nguyen thi lac tran. When I book plane tickets, it gives spaces to put in a first name, middle name, and last name. Flight attendant with Vietnam Airlines gave us a hard time saying her ID did not match what I had put down in the computer during purchasing but eventually let us through. How is this name supposed to be organized when the four names need to be separated into first, middle, and last?

                              <span>Hello, I am a person who loves Vietnam very much and has traveled here many times. My favorite destination is the sea in Vietnam, and I have discovered many beautiful beaches suitable for relaxation. Here are the top beautiful beaches in Vietnam that I would recommend:
 1. Lang Co Beach, Hue
 https://preview.redd.it/pwikjgdh37kb1.jpg?width&#x3D;1350&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a1c23e31562a1a517529d1b6210d53dd76dd40f5
 This is my favorite beach. Lang Co Beach is very clean and beautiful, as well as having a wild beauty. I am a person who does not like beaches that are too crowded with tourists and are interfered with by travel companies or resorts, so this is an ideal place for those who love natural beauty.
 2. My Khe Beach, Da Nang
 https://preview.redd.it/inksi4zs47kb1.jpg?width&#x3D;591&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;d44aeb8b8290eecbb18e5bd35d44ad093bd842e5
 Although it is pretty crowded with tourists, the scenery is still beautiful, and there are many exciting activities on the sea that you can participate in, such as playing volleyball, surfing, or. I highly recommend the Paragliding service Paragliding in Da Nang. Should join once in a lifetime to admire the city scenery and enjoy the beauty of Da Nang from above.
 3. Mui Ne Beach
 https://preview.redd.it/2tzaoes737kb1.jpg?width&#x3D;2048&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6b9b48b16c9be0969a10ce85e79b64b51503ee36
 Mui Ne is suitable for resort tourism, with luxurious 5-star resorts along the coast. Mui Ne Beach will give you a feeling of peace, not hustle.
 There are also many beautiful beaches in Vietnam that you can refer to in the Top 10 beautiful beaches in Vietnam. I rate the shores of Vietnam as very beautiful, and next time I will evaluate some coastal resorts for those who intend to go to the beach for reference.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ll be visiting HCMC and Hanoi in October, and have a few questions that I&#x27;m hoping someone here can help me with. 
  
Do any of the teams have HQs or retails shops that I could visit, similar to T1&#x27;s setup in Seoul? Ideally Hanoi, as I&#x27;m only in HCMC for 2 days. 
 
If not team retail shops, any idea where I can buy some team kit from other retail shops? I really like the GAM shirts, but happy to support any/all teams. 
 
Any idea if there will be Worlds 2023 viewing parties in Hanoi? English-speaking?
 
 Thank you in advance

I‚Äôve always had a good experience with grab drivers during my 5 week stay, even outside of using the app, so I was fine with it. I called him 20 minutes before we wanted to be picked up and he calls back 5 minutes later to say he couldn‚Äôt make it and that someone else with license plate xxxxx was coming instead. I was already highly suspicious at this point.
 The new guy calls and we get into his 7-seater car (we‚Äôre with 5 people at this point and the previous guy had a 4-seater). I show him the two addresses we need to go to and show him the price in Grab. He disagreed, stating his car was more expensive as it‚Äôs a 7-seater. He came up with a lot more bullshit ar‚Ä¶</span>

(Thinking like tlinh, MONO, GREY D, MIN, W/N, Suboi, Binz, Orange, Ho√†ng D≈©ng, etc.) While he was born there, he‚Äôs been in the US for a while so he isn‚Äôt sure the best place to search. Okay if the website is in Vietnamese since he can help translate. Thank you, c·∫£m ∆°n!!

 TIA!

                              <span>So my Vietnamese friend is going to open his new store next week, and he invited me (Chinese but born and raised in Germany) to take part in the prayers. He told me because my age is auspicious and will bring good luck to the new store. I myself is not religious and the asian tradition is unfamiliar to me so I would like to know more what this is all about, thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am half Vietnamese (born and raised in US) and am trying to get in touch with my Vietnamese side.
 My mother fled from the war when she was very young, so a lot of our family‚Äôs traditions and cultures have been lost on my side. 
 A lot of my female family wears jade wrist bangles and other jade jewelry. I was wondering if there is something similar to this permanent jewelry that men wear? I love the idea of wearing a jade bangle, but from my understanding it is something meant for women rather than me. I was unable to find information about this topic from Google, so I am asking here. 
 Thanks!

I‚Äôll be in SEA for three months and, to me, that sounds excessive. Is this a necessary precaution or is there another option?

 It&#x27;s good to see mental health getting a little attention lately. What are your thoughts? For example, is there enough of the right kind of mental health care?

                              <span>Hi all, planning to possibly relocate from the Philippines to Vietnam. However, I have a snubnosed dog which has to fly in cabin. I noticed that Vietnam Airlines is a possibility, but they don‚Äôt fly from Manila it seems (only codeshare).
 Does anyone have a solution? Would even consider by sea.

 Thoughts and recommendations? 
 My partner has never been to Vietnam so I think she would benefit from at least dipping her toes.

                              <span>I&#x27;m really feeling exhausted with ESL, I&#x27;ve been doing it for 10 years and would merely label my talent as &#x27;capable&#x27;. I don&#x27;t particularly wish to pursue a management position. I&#x27;m in a 4 year relationship and I can&#x27;t bring myself to commit simply because I don&#x27;t want to do this job for the rest of my life. I make about 10 bucks more an hour than when I first started which doesn&#x27;t even make up for inflation.
 I&#x27;m willing to learn a new skill and study but I just don&#x27;t know what other career paths are available to expats here. For the most part, I realise that many non specialist occupations can be filled by a native who will work cheaper than I will. My observation is also that a lot of Western businesses shut down after a year leading me to think that the govt doesn&#x27;t make foreign business ownership easy.
 My question is what do I need to do to qualify myself for a job which will pay me enough to stay here? What industries can I be considering if I were to reskill?

                              <span>I‚Äôm not a Buddhist practitioner. I don‚Äôt go to temple. That being said I would like to start a discussion about monks from an observational pov. I frequent vegetarian places from b√¨nh d√¢n food to restaurants like B√† X√£ and I would frequently see monks. Nothing that sounds out of the ordinary, right? Most of the time I‚Äôll see monks that would dine in pairs, usually eating in silence. Then there are groups of normies who accompany the monks, and sometimes one man or one woman with a monk. And this is a one time occurrence that I‚Äôve had a friend tell me, he saw a ‚Äòmonk‚Äô bring into a vegetarian restaurant his ‚Äògh·ªá‚Äô and sneak in beer. He and his lover were kicked out of the establishment.
 So‚Ä¶.. I guess I‚Äôm curious of a few things. Is it important for some people to want to build a rapport with monks? Is treating them to dinner a part of gaining good merit or something? And just how many monks out there are genuine, fraudulent, or in between with questionable morals?

                              <span>I noticed that both male and female Vietnamese seems to prefer women to be very slender. I met Vietnamese in Vietnam and in North America that prefer it when the collarbone is exposed. Seen guys deem women who were fit, to be too fat. I&#x27;m talking about an athletic girl with muscle where fat doesn&#x27;t seem to be the appropriate adjective to use. Have seen the obsession by women to have pale skin. I really want to know if guys don&#x27;t like women with curves. The hour glass shape seems to be surpassed by a slender and more modest silhouette. Just curious to know peoples honest and personal opinions along with what they believe to be the national standard.

                              <span>I am going to be in HCMC in a couple of days. Haven&#x27;t booked anything yet because I figured I could just walk into a hotel and book a room. It&#x27;s what I did 14 years ago but it just dawned on me that things may have changed. 
 I would like to stay as close to the clubs as possible so that I can stumble into bed after a drunken night out.
 Any suggestions appreciated. Aiming for $70 USD per night.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Sorry for the tourist post, but I tried asking in the stickied post yesterday and didn&#x27;t get any responses. I have recently decided to come and visit Vietnam for about 10 days and I have a few questions I thought I should ask before I arrive.
 My plan so far is to fly in to HCM for a couple of days, then head up through Hoi An/Da Nang/Hue, before moving on to Hanoi and possibly Ha Long.
 I know I can fly between HCM/Da Nang/Hanoi, but what would be the best way to get between Hoi An/Da Nang/Hue? Also between Hanoi and Ha Long?
 How different are HCM and Hanoi? Are they both worth the same amount of time?
 What is the public transport like in the cities? What is the best way to get around?
 What kind of weather can I expect during September?
 I obviously still want to be able to use my phone for internet while I&#x27;m over there. What&#x27;s a good sim card option for tourists?
 Even though I&#x27;m bound to visit some bars during my stay, I&#x27;m not much of a drinker anymore. Is there anything else that&#x27;s good to do at night in these locations that doesn&#x27;t necessarily involve drinking?
 What should I expect to pay for things like food and drinks?
 What&#x27;s the best way to see Ha Long?
 Is there any other advice you have for a solo tourist that might not be obvious to foreigners?
 Anyone want to hang out with a random Australian passing through?
 I did have some other questions, but I&#x27;ve forgotten them. Will update as I remember. 
 Thanks for your help.

He says it&#x27;s to feel healthy(kh·ªèe) and didn&#x27;t explain further. I couldnt find anything online. Is it like a mini vape pen or to help curb cigarette addiction?

                              <span>Hey everybody, I&#x27;m moving from the usa to Vietnam in about a month and a half. I&#x27;ll be staying in vung tau but i have so many questions, how do i overcome the language barrier and how bad is it? How do i go about setting up mobile service and can it take international calls? Do i rent a car or use grab? How are the gyms out there, are steroids legal as i am on trt? I see some really spiteful posts on here about foreigners and some really nice ones, what&#x27;s the general sentiment of Americans looking to migrate to Vietnam?
 Anything else i missed or should know? I&#x27;ve also got a dog, out here i take him on walks, shopping, to cafes with me, etc, is that acceptable there?

                              <span>Every post is just things that are bad everywhere and often worse in many other parts of the world - dirty bathrooms, unhelpful landlords, an education system that doesn&#x27;t prepare you well for the real world - congrats you just described every country on earth, but just add &quot;why is Vietnam like this&quot; at the end... 
 Can we get back to posting cool outings, beautiful scenery, awesome food shots, and other things that are unique to Vietnam and are huge parts of what make Vietnam such an amazing place? The negativity towards problems that exist all over is tiring.

Are there any other places in Saigon that kept their old names, and why did those particular streets keep their old names?

Most that I have searched are dentists that cannot speak English and they graduated from local universities. The handle English conversations with the assistance of dental assistant. Any good and qualified dentists that can do implants?

                              <span>Hi! So a little background is probably needed for this.
 I am currently living in Denmark as a sort of exchange student and recently went to a local Vietnamese place. I started speaking with the sweet lady who worked there and tried asking different things in Vietnamese. We got to speaking (it‚Äôs really funny cause our only common language is Danish, so neither of us were speaking our native tongue once we got past my very broken Vietnamese) and we had a wonderful conversation.
 At one point, after hearing my dogshit Vietnamese, but realizing I love Vietnamese food and people, she did the thing I‚Äôve only ever seen before and invited me to her home. 
 My question is, how do you respond to this? I said thank you of course, but do people ever accept the invite? Refuse? Is it rude to go or not to go? I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs one of those things people say but don‚Äôt expect a follow through on, or if it is something where they want you to come. I don‚Äôt mind going at all, but I also really don‚Äôt want to impose. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 
 Ps: lady gave me a bag of pears too and refused to let me pay. She was so nice üò≠üò≠

                              <span>Few weeks ago, Bloomberg ran an article saying that VN is now a major game developing nation. Can you recommend me some games or game studios on Android please?
 The only game that I have and know from VN is a xiangqi chess game. I&#x27;ve only played board/chess and cognitive games, but open to try other kinds of game, just to see how good the game developing scene in VN is.
 Thanks.

                              <span>So basically near my house, there is this street food stall which I frequently visit after work to have dinner. They sell Ph·ªü and other kinds of noodle soup.
 But they also sell this dish. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the correct name for it in English, but it&#x27;s pork&#x27;s brain boiled in water and added with some herbs. It&#x27;s called &quot;√ìc Tr·∫ßn&quot;
 So I came in and ordered a bowl of Ph·ªü. The owner nodded, signaling that he heard it. I suddenly felt the urge to eat that pork brain dish, I then spoke out loud to me, saying,
 &quot;Anh c√≤n √≥c kh√¥ng v·∫≠y?&quot; Which is roughly translated to &quot;Do you have any brain left at all?&quot; 
 The owner looked very shell-shocked at me, looking very confused. I thought he didn&#x27;t heard me correctly, I spoke even louder, &quot;Anh c√≥ √≥c kh√¥ng ·∫°?&quot;, which is &quot;Do you have brain?&quot;
 The whole stall and everyone on the tables were looking at me confusingly, and the owner looked even more shell-shocked! I still then didn&#x27;t understand what was wrong, I told him that, &quot;√ìc tr·∫ßn ·∫°!&quot;, which is &quot;Boiled brain!&quot;. He changed his facial expression immediately to smiling, lol
 Sitting down, I still didn&#x27;t firgure out why he and other people looking at me that weirdly. It took me a few minites to realize how horrible that could come across, lol! In vietnam, if we tell someone that they have no brain, or ask them if they have brain or not, it means that we are insulting them and telling them they are dumb and stupid! Lol!

                              <span>I moved to Vietnam a month ago for an internship. In this time i saw a few men that let one nail grow longer than the others. I think its usually the pinky finger? Now i wondered if that&#x27;s a thing, if there is a meaning behind this or of it was just an accident i saw a bunch, and then started to see more because i started to look for it.

                              <span>Like, it&#x27;s just suck. And here&#x27;s why:
  
Memorization: While memorization IS a necessary skill for real life, it&#x27;s one of the most useless one. There is loads of other skills an education system should focus on for helping students with later life. However, just look at the Vietnamese textbook. What did you see? IT&#x27;S JUST MEMORY! There is nearly no other skills. Critical thinking? Zero. Creativity? Zero. Heck, only logical thinking has some representation, and that representation is minuscule in my opnion. I can&#x27;t think of a reason why don&#x27;t they teach other skills rather than just memorization.
 Obsession over Grade: This is the worst problem by a long shot. Due to (let me check what it&#x27;s called...) confucianism, the Vietnamese people value education. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a good thing, but for some reasons, it has turned into an obsession over grade and score. And well, just google &quot;b·ªánh th√†nh t√≠ch&quot; to see how bad it is. Tbh, I think it is not exactly the fault of the Ministry of Education, but it&#x27;s too popular to not mention.
 Underpaid teacher: Self-explanatory. This forced teachers to teach more in bonus class (idk how to translate h·ªçc th√™m, sorry) and create more stress to already stressed kid.
 Boring asf: Also self-explanatory
  
Tbf, they are trying to fix these problem, and while they are not even close to fix these, theres still some progress. Hopefully they can fix all of this in near future
 (sorry for any mistake)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen this SO many times. I rent a house, and it starts to fall apart, and they expect ME to foot the bill. Or, you make improvements on the house and they want to raise the rent because of the improvement. 
 Right now, the roof above one of my bathrooms is leaking and I need to figure that out and my landlord isn&#x27;t going to help me. I have a friend that installed ceilings in his house. When he moved out, he ripped them down and made a terrible mess for the owners to clean up. I&#x27;ll do the same if I have to.

                              <span>I&#x27;m personally half French half Thai, and me and my siblings all have black hair and eyes. I thought most eurasian people would have such features. But I know two different person being half French half Vietnamese and they both have green eyes. I wonder if it is common for Vietnamese mixed persons to get lights eyes colors ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never experienced theft firsthand before and this experience has been not so pleasant in my memory. At noon time on August 22, 2023, I parked my red Honda Wave motorbike across from Eddie&#x27;s Wok in Thao Dien. Specifically, it was a sidewalk with other parked motorbikes, so I figured it might be a parking spot, even though there were no guards. It was stupid of me to believe that surveillance cameras would deter any bike thieves. I stopped at Eddie&#x27;s for lunch and when I was done, I found my motorbike to be missing. I reported it to the authority of ph∆∞·ªùng Th·∫£o ƒêi·ªÅn and it was all that I could do. 
 I now realized that I was naive to park at a place with no security. I really liked that bike and I&#x27;ve had a lot of good memories with it. I also lost two helmets and a raincoat was on the bike. Like I said, I&#x27;ve never experienced theft before and I really hope that the police can get it back. But in the mean time, I&#x27;ve been blaming myself and the memory of the shocking realization is still coming back. What should I do?

                              <span>Hi guys!
 A group of friends and I booked a trip to Viet Nam on a whim because the flights happened to be quite cheap from Indonesia end of August.
 We will be landing in Da Lat which we were interested in because the city looks unique, and will be departing from Ho Chi Minh city. We&#x27;ll be there 28th Aug to 7th Sep. Currently the plan is to be in Da Lat for 3 nights in the beginning, then in Ho Chi Minh City from 3 Sep onwards. This leaves the 31st to 3rd on our schedule empty for potential things we can do. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do or places to go/stay on those middle 3 nights? Maybe somewhere off Da Lat and HCMC, or on the way between those two cities?
 For example we were potentially looking at checking Bao Loc out for something kinda off the beaten tourist path, but are wondering about how to get around within the city there. Is Grab readily available etc. 
 Second thing we were wondering about is how reliable the inter-city buses are. We could find schedules but can&#x27;t figure out how to book them online, so is it simple to go to the bus station and book tickets? How early in advance should we book them and do the tickets run out fast on the routes from Da Lat -&gt; HCMC? Also would you even recommend going by bus between cities for tourists with no command of the Vietnamese language save for Google Translate camera? We were thinking of going by bus for a more affordable experience and to sightsee/experience how traveling through the country by land is, but of course a plane ride between the two cities is still an option.
 Really excited to visit Viet Nam as I&#x27;ve never been there and I appreciate any help you guys can give! Thank you!

                              <span>I know this is a bad idea. But it was a miss on my end that I wasn&#x27;t able to check this holiday when I booked a flight. I was just excited to book since the tickets were on sale. üòÇ
 Anyway, fam and I will be travelling to Da Nang this Feb 8-13. Any tips on how to ensure we still enjoy the trip? Planning to stay longer in Hoi An since I heard most establishments are BAU during this time. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>What animals in Vietnam are not afraid of humans? In America, if I wanted to I could pick up a city pigeon or a goose in the park. Some squirrels will even run up to my feet in university, some people feed them. Is there any parallels in Vietnam, I know a woman who kidnapped a squirrel, but it was young and she let it go after a week.

                              <span>Suddenly feeling the urge to ask this question, because while the US is more well-known to be more open-minded about gender expression, I feel that the male beauty standard there is actually quite strict and harsh. 
 I only see the most buff, shredded, muscular guys being presented in American movies and series, and only them is positively presented. The &quot;nerds&quot; and the skinnier guys are often portrayed as a joke, a laughingstock. This might be a blindspot of mine, and I might be jumping to conclusion too early with not enough observation. But I feel the male beauty standard in the West, or at least the US, is very big, very jock-like, buff-y, brute, masculine-ish.
 And while Asia, or Vietnam, is said to be more conservative, but I actually feel like we allow men to be more things. The big, buffy with tan lines image is accepted. Also accepted is the slim, fair skin, quieter, smart, sweet and soft-spoken, &quot;th∆∞ sinh&quot; type. Nobody has to be big and shredded with 6 packs to be considered a man. Am I right about this?

                              <span>i am looking to do a 3 month trip between april, may and june 2024 in vietnam. however, i have no idea where in vietnam to go and want a physical copy guide to get a more general sense of what the different areas are like and hence what general area i would be most interested in visiting, rather than an in-depth description of what cafes and restaurants to visit in a certain part of Hanoi. 
 can anyone recommend a travel guide that would be most useful for this type of research?

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the look of the Honda Dream II while in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve seen it everywhere fron north to south.
 Google it back home (Spain) and I get lots of vietnamese results. Was this moto especifically marketed in Vietnam and/or SEA? 
 Was it marketed in Europe under a different name?
 Thanks a lot :)

                              <span>Just moved here. Big city.
 Local food is GREAT, but I definitely need more protein in my diet on top of that.
 Gonna start eating a bunch of eggs, but I still need protein powder and perhaps there is some local food I don&#x27;t know about?
 Something with soy maybe?

 I&#x27;m doing this so that people thinking of moving to Vietnam can ask questions, as well as locals who might be curious about my experience here.

 Also, most underrated?
 I guess they are extremely subjective, but I would love to hear people‚Äôs thoughts and opinions. 
 I‚Äôll start - overrated - got to be b√† n√† hills. I know a lot of people don‚Äôt rate it to begin with, but I just think it‚Äôs got no value at all tbh. 
 Underrated - V≈©ng t√†u, I really love this small beach town, perfect place to day trip from HCMC

                              <span>Hey there, just moved to a new apartment Hanoi and spent the whole night awake from honking and traffic. I am looking to get some moving blankets to hang up over my door and windows to block out some of the sound (pic attached). However I can‚Äôt find these blankets anywhere on shopee/figure out what the Vietnamese translation for them would be. They are extremely thick and heavy blankets and used to protect furniture when moving. If anyone could let me know where I could buy these in Hanoi/online for shipping in Vietnam that would be a huge help! Also if anyone has any recommendations for a shop in ba Dinh that could do some sewing as well I‚Äôd appreciate it.

                              <span>Anyone else notice that Vietnamese that live in America (and maybe other English speaking countries idk) will pepper in very specific English words when speaking Vietnamese? Like I get mixing the languages, especially when you‚Äôre talking to someone in Vietnamese about something that originally happened in English, but I‚Äôve noticed that people seem to favor using the words ‚Äúparking‚Äù and ‚Äúmove‚Äù instead of the perfectly serviceable Vietnamese equivalents, even when the rest of their sentence is in Vietnamese. Like one time a pregnant lady was talking about how she could feel her baby move and instead of saying th·∫•y em b√© ƒë·∫°p she said th·∫•y em b√© move (except it sounded like moo with her accent lol). Any idea why people do this?

                              <span>i was born and raised in the states and pretty much speak only english or vietglish with my parents, i have a very beginner level of viet. i know that you are supposed to say ‚Äúd·∫°‚Äù like ‚Äúd·∫° c√≥‚Äù, ‚Äúth∆∞a‚Äù, other words to show respect. but who do you say it to? is it mainly to your older family members, or anyone who‚Äôs older than you? is there an age where you stop saying d·∫°/th∆∞a? would it be seen as really bad if you didn‚Äôt use these words? when i overhear my parents talking, they say it to relatives who are older than them (e.g. my great uncle) but not to everyone, for example they wouldn‚Äôt say it to an older hairdresser they know well or my elderly teacher. but they do say it to monks and nuns when we go to the temple, ‚Äúd·∫° con ƒë·∫øn l·ªÖ h√¥m nay‚Äù for example. how do you know when and how you have to use these honorifics? are there unspoken rules?

                              <span>We visited Hu·∫ø not too long ago on our trip through Vietnam, and it quickly became one of our favorite stops of the whole trip. We only had one day there as our visas were expiring, but we were able to cram a good amount of stuff in to that 24 hours... considering 8 of them were spent sleeping. 
 We would have loved to explore outside of the city a little more. The walking street is small but lively, the food is incredible. One of our best dining experiences in Vietnam (I mean, seriously, b√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø?) and the Imperial City is massive. One of our favorite archaeological sites we&#x27;ve visited. 
 I noticed when we were doing research, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as many searches or views on YouTube and other sites the way Hoi An or Da Nang do. It&#x27;s a shame. I think it&#x27;s very under rated. 
 Why do you think this is? We&#x27;d love to know.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am a Vietnamese American who lived in the US for almost 18 years. I will be moving to live in Vietnam for 2-3 years soon. Over in the US, I worked in a logistics company for 2 years and I have my Bachelor&#x27;s degree. 
 My cousin who is in the logistic field recommends that I teach English instead ( I do not really want to continue my logistic career either tbh) because the job prospect in VN is not great for logistics.
 However, I do not want to teach large groups of people. Is it easy for new English teachers to find jobs teaching small groups or even 1-on1? Does anyone here teaches English but only work with small group or individuals?
 I heard being an English teaching assistant was decent, does anyone have experience in this job?
 What about teaching Vietnamese to foreigners in Vietnam? 
 I am a little bit lost when thinking of jobs and it is creating some anxiety.
 Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.

                              <span>Next month I will be spending a month in Northern Vietnam as a tourist, specifically Ninh Binh but I also plan to visit other areas.
 I&#x27;m mostly planning the trip to relax and meditate.
 I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to travel up to forests with a scooter and just walk in a little bit, so I can sit there alone. Is it safe regarding animals, and how likely is it the forest is private property and I&#x27;m not supposed to be there?

 I‚Äôd like to stop off at some of the best spots along the way, some are set other‚Äôs Id like to hear what other tourists/locals think. Being from the U.K., I have 14 days to do everything visa free before moving on. 
 HCMC - I‚Äôd like to spend 2/3 days here tbh. I lived in HCMC for 2 months, so I‚Äôd like to show my partner around the city, and also deal with some unfinished business (Suoi Tien!) 
 Da Lat - I‚Äôd like to spend 1/2 days here. Some friends loved it here, I believe there‚Äôs a super cool maze themed bar. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs quite a touristy place. But honestly, that‚Äôs okay. This trip is part of a 40/50 day trip with my partner who has never been to As‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Hi, 
 I‚Äôm thinking about booking a flight to Vietnam in November and travel SEA countries while i‚Äôm there. 
 Do you recommend visiting North(hanoi area) or South(hcmc area)? It‚Äôll be my first time in Vietnam and I‚Äôm planning to stay there for about a week.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 23M currently living in Hanoi. I&#x27;m the only male in my family, my mother has singlehandedly raised both me and my sister up. 
 Anyone living in Vietnam, or especially the northern part of it, would certainly understand the pressure put down on the men in the family line to get married and have children. But the thing is that I&#x27;m gay, and I&#x27;m not planning anywhere in the future to deceive any girl into a marriage with a guy who doesn&#x27;t love them, just for my selfish motivation, which is to &quot;fulfill responsibility.&quot; Despite having had many girls showing interests and some even confessing their love for me, it would just be a very cruel act to rob away a girl&#x27;s chance of true love and happiness in life just for my selfish reason. 
 And I don&#x27;t want to have any kids either, even if I&#x27;m a straight guy. But my mother is getting older too, and she does deserve having a grandchild to care for, to have someone to brighten and bring her happiness at her later years. But even for that, I could just adopt a child, there&#x27;s no need to lure a girl into marriage just to have a child.
 But I don&#x27;t even want to adopt kids. Best case scenario, I found a guy who&#x27;s my true love, we&#x27;re both financially stable enough to be able to adopt and raise a child with love. Much more likely, I would end up alone, I much more prefer it that way though. Living to the very end of my 40s, then that&#x27;s enough.
 Do you know anyone who&#x27;s a Vietnamese, who chose to live like me, choosing to live alone for the rest of their lives? Do they got respected? Do other Vietnamese look down on them?

                              <span>Seems like Nha Trang gets a lot of hate on this sub. I‚Äôve been travelling SE Asia for a few months and decided, against advice, to stop in Nha Trang for two nights. I was super tired from travelling and just wanted to stop for a couple days before continuing on north. I actually thought it was a nice place for a stop over. It felt calm and I relaxed a bit, but I started feeling a bit disconnected after two nights so moved on to Danang.
 Pros:
  
surprisingly calm place. I‚Äôve been enjoying sitting in coffee shops in the streets set back from the beach which were actually quite nice to explore. Quite leafy and relaxed pace after coming from HCMC which I did not enjoy.
 
nice people and a mix too. Honestly I‚Äôd heard so many negative things about Russians and Chinese. Russians largely keep to ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I like many things about Vietmam, but....
 We were in one of the huge malls (Aeon mall) to have dinner. Public dining area was packed, but we managed to fine a table. The thing is the previous customers left their trash on the table, so we asked a cleaner to clean the table. Then, the most shocking and unacceptable thing had happened. Because the tissue paper dispenser was empty, the cleaner casually and probably out of habit took some tissues from the TRASH CAN and cleaned our table. Like what in the world! 
 We just couldn&#x27;t shake the experience off and duly reported it to the mall authorities. 
 Wow! I just can&#x27;t get over it somehow. It&#x27;s like the experience has turned into a nasty core memory. üòÇ

                              <span>I hate propaganda as much as the next guy, but the fact that modern Viet Nam don&#x27;t have any good war, horror, fantasy, historical movies and tv shows, boggles my mind. You would assumed that with the long history of conflict, diverse culture, fantastic mythology, long history AND state funded is a thing AND modern technology AND already tried and succeed examples (see movies from China, Korea, Japan, UK) even countries like INDIA, NORWAY, TURKEY, are stepping up their game with movies and tv series. Same go for video games. Don&#x27;t even get me started on the propaganda movies, especially with the propaganda movies, propaganda war movies about war heroes are the easiest to make IMHO, should be easily State funded, so many war heroes to take inspiration from ( and if you&#x27;re saying they aren&#x27;t real because their story are too crazy, remember Hacksaw Ridge is based on a real story), so many examples from successful movies to take notes. So stop making &quot;comedy&quot; and &quot;in-law drama&quot; please.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m looking to stay 1 month in Da Nang, looking to book a 1 month rental, preferably something with kitchen. Any suggestions where I can do this online other than airbnb/ agoda/ booking? I&#x27;m looking for something on the cheap side, if I found something for 5 million I would be happy. Is it better to book online or go there and try to book it in person?
 Thanks!

What do you think, can he do it or the inflation gonna eat him alive ?

                              <span>Personally I love that everyone relaxes or sleeps at noon. However, it&#x27;s not common and even looked down upon in America, I used to be yelled at by my parents for it. Just like everyone else I try to nap after lunch but I&#x27;m getting anxiety like I&#x27;m not being productive so now I can&#x27;t nap. Wondering if any other foreigners had this issue and if there&#x27;s a mental pep talk to get over this lol. It&#x27;s hot, things are closed and I want to enjoy this relaxing way of beating the heat.

I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs origins and was scared to try because any raw blood can be harmful to the human body but I ate it anyways because I didn‚Äôt want to look bad in front of everyone.

 My (31M) wife (27F) and I currently live in a HCOL area. She‚Äôs Vietnamese and immigrated to the US when she was in high school. I am Asian-American (non-Vietnamese but learning the language!) and born in the US. We are both doing pretty well in our careers. I‚Äôm a software engineer and she‚Äôs an ICU nurse, currently going to grad school to be a nurse practitioner. But the grind in America seems to have taken its toll on my wife, especially being a nurse through the COVID-era.

 Where do you come from, why choose VN? Im from small city, looking to move to HCMC for 6 months. Some things I‚Äôve not learned about yet;health care system, insurance, remote jobs.

 Some fried pork puffs or spicy rice paper with some stuffs?! Oi choi oi! 
 You can talk about munchies from anywhere. One of my top top munchies is Cheez-it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning a 1.5 week long trip to Vietnam, flying into HCMC. I would most likely plan a few nights in the city to explore it, but I mostly want to spend time in nature and relax, as a mental health retreat and for the fact that I can&#x27;t walk a lot anyway due to physical issues.
 I&#x27;m looking for an area not too far from HCMC, that&#x27;s not too hard to reach with public transport of private transport. An area with some decent but affordable hotels. 
 What would you recommend?

                              <span>Cannnot send and receive SMS since Sunday 13 August. There was a small window on Tuesday night, when I received a barrage of SMS messages (including test messages I sent my self and sms messages from Three UK technicians etc.)
 While the SMS messages were coming through, I noticed that the phone network had changed from Mobiphone to Vinaphone (or similar - I don&#x27;t remember the name exactly. It wasn&#x27;t viettel.)
 Next morning when I checked phone the network had gone back to the previous automatic select setting: Mobiphone. Again, no SMS&#x27;s received. 
 I remember the same issue happened a few years ago, but it was promptly sorted out. This occasion, I&#x27;ve reported the issue to THree (UK). They are yet to revert to me with an explanation and/or workaround. 
 Anyone encounter similar issue when using your home country mobile in Vietnam?. Are you able to send and received SMS message?

                              <span>My wife (vietnamese) and I (Austrian) are thinking about buying some property in Vietnam. Possibly as investment but also as a future home for ourselves. We currently live in Europe but probably want to move to Saigon in the future to be closer to my parents in law.
  
Is there anything we have to keep in mind about the citizenship of my wife? She is thinking of becoming Austrian citizen but unfortunately Austria doesn&#x27;t allow dual citizenship, meaning she needs to give up her vietnamese passport. Can we still purchase real estate in Vietnam although none of us will be vietnamese citizenship? If we buy a property before she changes her nationality, will it have any legal consequences regarding the property?
 
What are some recommended webpages to look for properties (south Vietnam, Saigon, Da Lat) online? (vietnamese only is fine)
 
Is there any kind of public accessible data about average prices per square meter for different regions across the south of Vietnam?
 
Is it common in Vietnam to hire an agent when buying a property which does the searching for us and asks for a reasonable commission? How would we go about finding someone professional?We are not searching for and cannot afford a luxury property. E.g. I doubt we can afford something in downtown Saigon.
 
Any other obvious pitfalls that we should know of? I know that we are very much at the beginning of the process and we are both pretty clueless. I&#x27;m more of the &quot;handyman&quot; in the relationship but unfortunately I do not speak vietnamese yet and it&#x27;s hard for me to research by myself. Hence it&#x27;s a learning process that me and my wife have to go through together. 
 
 Thanks a lot for any input and help!

                              <span>My party of 4 arrived at the Da Nang airport a few hours ago. I did some research and know that I need to order car with Grab, which I did. Then I encountered 3 scams back to back, 2 unsuccessful and 1 successful. 
 The app told us to go to the pick up area, which we did. There&#x27;s a brunch of guys there, which I knew was very suspicious, so I chose to ignore them. 
  
The Grab driver then called and told me that he&#x27;s about 20 minutes away, he&#x27;s stuck in traffic and asked that I cancel the ride. I told him the app showed that he&#x27;s on the other side of the parking lot. He hung up cause my internet was shitty, then we exchanged texts where we pretty much said the same thing a second time. I told him that he is committing fraud and he needs to cancel if he&#x27;s not ready to pick us up. He then end‚Ä¶</span>

 I asked my uncle why doesn‚Äôt he install a metal bar to hold onto or at least lay down a rubber mat on the tile. He said she just needs to be more careful next time and that it ‚Äúprobably‚Äù won‚Äôt happen again.
 I have another relative who I‚Äôve seen text message/look at porn with both hands while driving his scooter in the middle of traffic and of course he‚Äôs been in multiple accidents but they were ‚Äúnot that bad‚Äù.

                              <span>Just to preface this I know I&#x27;m a sad old man and I hate fun. I don&#x27;t like drinking or going to clubs and bars so I generally avoid them. Despite this I don&#x27;t mind them existing because they are easily avoidable.
 I am currently travelling in Vietnam and it would seem that the karaoke is impossible to avoid, generally because it is so loud and there are so many karaoke bars. Here in Dalat some of them seem to operate even in the middle of the day. Even the staff at my hostel do it (none of the guests seem to participate). This isn&#x27;t just for a couple hours in the evening either, they seem to enjoy doing it constantly from 6pm to 10pm. 4 hours of this shit? Really?
 I suppose aside from ranting my question is why is everybody expected to tolerate this intrusive activity in Vietnam? Does everyone enjoy listening to this or do they just accept that it exists and move on? Also, are there any actual rules around karaoke bars I.e. when and where they are allowed to operate?

                              <span>Currently I&#x27;m 25 vietnamese male, used to get in a university but dropped out due to financial problem, just finished military service this year. I&#x27;m studying programming at a education center, and going to finish in the next 2 month.
 I&#x27;ve always want to study abroad to have a wider and better view of the world we&#x27;ve living in. And also, since I have never complete my college, I want to continute it by participating in a international university to accomplish a degree in computer science. I&#x27;m planning to actually do it by the age of 30 (I don&#x27;t think I will get married by that time). I&#x27;m just wondering is there any cases like me in Vietnam and actually get into a foreign college by 30 or older? Because when I try to google my concern, the result I get seem mostly come from already developed conutries.

                              <span>About to fly from Hanoi to Canada and got a brand new tablet still in its original packaging untouched in carry on. 
 Anyone who flew with new unopened electronics in their carry on out of Noi Bai before -- did they make you unbox your device at security to put through the x-ray scanner? or can you just scan it with the box and packaging and everything still intact? 
 Should I just store it in my checked baggages instead? The device&#x27;s battery is under 100Wh (75Wh) -- both Canada CATSA and the U.S. FAA allow it to be checked in, just needs to be turned off and well packed.

 I know in America at least Vietnamese cuisine is largely stuck in the 70s. Is this a phrase that has always existed, or is it a new word? I only really hear it from hipster white people who love categorizing and labeling things.

                              <span>2 years ago in Hanoi I saw a small child (I estimate 3 years old) hanging onto her mom on a scooter and getting t boned by a car going in the opposite direction. The child was flung 20 feet across the pavement and my xe om driver just kept driving on.
 . Another incident occurred that same summer.
 I‚Äôm kinda messed up by it. Anyone else?

                              <span>Hi, I am looking to move to Vietnam, but the thing that scares me the most are insects.
 What is the probability of me encountering a centipede in here? What can I do for lowering the chance of meeting them closer to 0?
 I heard there are a lot of nasty and scary crawling things around. I want to feel safe at home and not be constantly thinking of some scolopendra crawling up on me.. brrr...

                              <span>My friend is Vietnamese and is having his wedding in January in Vietnam and we‚Äôll spend a few days doing touristy stuff before. I gotta go because he‚Äôs a good friend and plus I really want to. Problem is that I have a mild tree nut allergy and deadly peanut allergy. My friend promised he‚Äôll translate and won‚Äôt let anything happen to me but I‚Äôm worried that either he won‚Äôt say the right thing, the chefs won‚Äôt understand what that means or there will be cross contamination because food allergies aren‚Äôt really a thing there as y‚Äôall probably know, and they may not follow strict food guidelines like they do not the states. Any tips for a fella in this situation? My plan is to stick to white rice and McDonald‚Äôs as much as possible but idk if I can do that for 10 days.

                              <span>Canadian tourist here. 
 I‚Äôve spent the last month travelling Vietnam, starting in the north and working my way south. I arrived in HCMC a couple days ago and have noticed a ton of places have a security guard sitting on a plastic chair outside. A lot of these seem to be restaurants or higher end retailers. 
 I didn‚Äôt notice anything like this in any other Vietnamese city I‚Äôve visited and I‚Äôm curious what the difference is. Are there a lot of thefts in HCMC? Is it to make sure nobody accosts tourists? Is it just to make places seem so fancy they need a guard? They seem to mostly be browsing their phones but maybe I‚Äôm missing something. What‚Äôs with all the protection?

                              <span>Here are my thoughts on my visit to VN after living abroad for 38 years
 1) shocked by the traffic Pedestrian and motorized vehicles completely mixed together 2) not accessible to handicapped 3) service is top notched if you interact with people on a personal level . lots of self employed people , owners are always on site and care about their business 
 I ordered a birthday cake and the bakery will deliver to the restaurant!!!!
 4) in the absence of personal interaction, people behaviour is just horrible , pushing others , never wait in line (I.e. when I was at the airport )
 5) phone service is so cheap , everyone is glued to their phone 
 6) the gap between the rich and the poor is just too much

 I mean, we&#x27;re all stuck in the same situation, right? It feels counterproductive and just adds to the noise and stress. Anyone else feel the same?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a teacher in Brazil and I am very interested in Vietnamese culture, specially about Education. My education was in a country and time very anticommunist, and I have discovered prosperous VietNam about 5 years. My formation is in Physics, so I am a late student about Marxism.
 Here in Brazil, most of people believes USA won VietNam war and that your country is a big and poor &quot;gueto&quot;. I got surprised (5 years ago, when I began to search for &quot;where socialism works well&quot;) to discover Vietnamese heros beated the Yankees.
 I have much respect for all Vietnamese people, you are heros or hero&#x27;s sons and daughters. I want to learn much about dialectic materialism and how your children are educated to build a so great country and nation.
 Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t speak Vietnamese, so I use Yankee-idiom. I tried to learn your language, but it was hard to me, so I&#x27;m learning mandarin first, so I could familiarize with a softer tonal idiom first.
 Love and respect to you Vietnamese!
 Peace among us, war to the lords!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am travelling to Vietnam from the 2nd to the 12th Initially I had planned for go from HCM to Da Nang, chill in Hoi An for a bit and go where the wind takes me for the rest of the holiday. Ideally wanted sunny weather, heat with diving and lazing on a beach. I&#x27;ve been doing some more research and checking 10 day forecast and a lot I&#x27;ve read is that the weather is potentially going to be the complete opposite of what I was wanting. 
 Can anyone give me some insight on where else I should go for my beach holiday or regardless it&#x27;s going to be a toss of the dice no matter where I go? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Me (29M) and my partner (28F) will be spending Christmas in Vietnam this year. We are either going to be in Da Nang/Hoi An or Nha Trang. Which would be better for 2 backpackers to spend Christmas? We will probably be in a hostel and will try and meet other people doing the same as us. Just wondering which is nicer, we are not looking for a western Christmas.

                              <span>Travelling to Southeast Asia this fall and realized we&#x27;ll be in Vietnam during the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. We&#x27;re flying in and out of Ho Chi Minh City but we&#x27;re also planning to move around the country (like to Hoi An, Phu Quoc, etc.) so our itinerary isn&#x27;t set in stone yet. 
 Any festivities to check out or must-dos for Tet Trung Thu that might influence where we want to be for that day? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I posted previously about the lethal Ben Thanh market. Today I visited Saigon Centre and my faith was restored! It‚Äôs probably a tourist trap but there was many lovely vendors. No pushy or forceful people. Maybe one or two but only in the minority. I could browse easily and didn‚Äôt feel like anyone was going to shout at me. 
 I didn‚Äôt buy anything today apart from a scarf. Can anyone tell me how the bargaining works here. Some said fixed prices some said give me your price. I tried halving but some ‚Äúsaid sorry no we cannot do it.‚Äù Then we came to an agreeable rate But it was only the vendors I purchased from. I didn‚Äôt barter with others but the price was really high for some stuff. 
 Any help?

                              <span>Hello my fellas! I am competing for a case competition, so I really need your help. The case is about fish sauce. I hope you can help me answering a few questions so that I can understand more about the market.
  
What makes you/your family member choose fish sauce? (packaging, taste,‚Ä¶)
 How can you tell between poor fish sauce and tasty one? 
 What do you prefer: bad fish sauce at a reasonable price or tasty fish sauce at a higher price?
 Are you willing to try new fish sauce that you have not tried before, or you‚Äôre going to be loyal to fish sauce that you like?
 What aspects of fish sauce do you care more about: smell, color of the fish sauce, or both? 
 To what extent do you think fish sauce is unique to Vietnamese daily cuisine?
  
Please help me win this case competition. Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

                              <span>My boyfriend‚Äôll come back üáªüá≥ in November to visit his family after 4 years in Germany.
 He agreed to let me travel with him (I begged him 100 times üòÖ).
 He informed his family about me. His dad, big brother, sister in law and younger sister were very excited, and his mum seemed neutral.
 We would spend 5 days in Hanoi with his family and visit Danang before coming back üá©üá™.
 His parents said I could stay in their house. They have a big house, so there are private spaces for me and boyfriend.
 I feel excited and concerned at the same time. Is it too ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù if I stay in their house? Or staying in hotel is safer option 
 What should I do to maintain good relationship with them as a westerner? If I stay with them, I can join their daily activities (cooking,‚Ä¶) and that‚Äôll be fun üòÅ
 I prepared some gifts for his little sister. She‚Äôs so sweet.

                              <span>I noticed that the prices to add extra luggage are different on web browser (22 USD) and the app (13.66 USD). And the cheaper app one won‚Äôt let me purchase it for some reason. Are we able to purchase extra luggage at the airport a few days before? I feel like my luggage (20kg) that I purchased will be heavier once I leave the country.

                              <span>Besides the government structure, what is socialist about Vietnam. It seems to me like people here operate on the most extreme capitalist mindset even more so than capitalist countries. There are more social safety nets, social goods, social ideologies in Europe, Australia, or USA, than there are here. Just as a quick dumb example: there are way more parks and public areas in any of those countries than here. And the few ones that there are here always end up overrun with people trying to sell crap. In &quot;capitalist countries&quot; more people tend to agree collectively to leave public places for the public. They (usually) tend agree to pay taxes to fund all sorts of social services. It seems to me that in Vietnam everyone is always chasing the most minor personal gain even at the cost of social advancements for all. What is social about Vietnam?

 Can it be shipped here in PH? I&#x27;ve been craving them ever since.

                              <span>I am a Vietnamese-American who traveled to Vietnam to see my family and I happened to meet a girl at a spa on my last day in Vietnam. (It was at a highly rated spa with legit services)
 I thought she was attractive so I started up a conversation to get to know her and she said she didn‚Äôt have a boyfriend. I got her instagram and we started to talk for a month. She was very enthusiastic (never one word answers) and flirty with all her responses except I always had to start all the conversations. I recently told her I was really interested in her but that it would be difficult for us to maintain a relationship being so far away from each other and she said she was interested too and that if we ‚Äúreally loved‚Äù then it would work. 
 However, I went through her instagram followers and found her boyfriend that she has been dating for like 9 months. She doesn‚Äôt have any photos of him on her instagram but the boyfriend has all the photos of her on his profile. 
 After finding out, I didn‚Äôt confront her about it and immediately stopped messaging her and she hasn‚Äôt messaged me either but that wasn‚Äôt surprising to me because I was always the one to start the conversations. I guess I can understand why now because she has a boyfriend‚Ä¶ Even though, we haven‚Äôt talked for a week, she still shows interest by liking my instagram stories.
 My question is why would she deceive me like this and waste all of my time? Was she ever actually interested in me?
 Part of me just wants to screenshot all the messages and send it to the boyfriend

                              <span>I live away from my family for just 10 years. However, the relationship between me and my parents was never good. I am close with my sister and my niece but the last time I saw them was 7 years ago. To be fair, we are all different people now. Although we text, call, talking in person is still another thing. 
 I left the country for education, for work but I also wanted to stay away from my family. Just typical Asian parents problems. Since moving away from them, our relationship got somewhat better, just because I don‚Äôt have to deal with bullshit anymore.
 I tried to put a smile on my face, I told my self that they will just stay for 1 month, I will be okay. But just 30 mins and I already felt depressed. It started with they filming me the second they saw me at the airport, shared it on Facebook and Tiktok, then with them trying to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me. Then they took off their shoes and put their feet on another seat when we were on public transport. I understand their motives, I just couldn‚Äôt stand it. The things they talk about, I can‚Äôt join. The things they do, I am not comfortable to. The cultural difference between us is big enough to keep us apart.
 I am worried that this trip will push me and my family away even further. 27 more days to go, and I don‚Äôt know how I should approach it.
