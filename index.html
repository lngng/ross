                              <span>My family is buying property just outside of HCMC. This property is so that my in-laws can retire back to Vietnam. We need to send just over 100K USD from the USA. Wiring/bank transfer of the money would be our safest bet I am assuming. If this is the case, will I be able to open a bank account in Vietnam with only a family visa? I am not able to get Vietnam citizenship reinstated. However my wife is, and she is currently waiting on the paper work to be finished. The property will be the in-law’s name. So I am not worried about loosing said property. Next question that I have is once money is in hand, in Vietnam, what is normally done/happens to transfer the title? Is it a red flag if a newly built condo does not have the red book,title? I was told that this is because the condo was recently built and at this time all units are not sold or finished yet. Though I do know that people have been living in that building for ả least 5 years. One would think that my in-laws would be able to answer these questions. But they have been living outside of Vietnam for 40 years. And I have no close relative alive in Vietnam to ask. Please excuse any poor wording or grammatical errors. Writing coherently in is still a struggle.

                              <span>Hey các bạn 😊 im going to Ba Vi for a night but i am feeling quite sick and I should cycle there and back on this weekend. I am already prepared that i can’t cycle back on Sunday. I was thinking is it possible to bring a bicycle on a local bus back to Hanoi? I’ve taken the local bus 71 before also and it got quite full that time. I could also use a taxi but i heard it would cost over 1mil VND and im thinking what would be most convinient way.
 Thank you in advance! 😊

 I really want to buy a record from an online shop in Vietnam and ship it to USA. How can I do this? I tried emailing the shop directly, and they said they can&#x27;t ship to USA. Does anyone here have experience with this?
 Thank you!

                              <span>- Many motorcyclists don&#x27;t wear a helmet, especially during rush hour, and traffic police just ignore them, and they even pass right next to them.
 - Many will turn right or left at the foot of a bridge, even cars. What&#x27;s worse, there are vendors on a freaking bridge!
 - Being on the phone while driving or riding. Worse, texting!
 - Cutting corners is a very common practice. 
 - Double parking, particularly in narrow streets.
 - The most dangerous, I think, is beating the red light, especially without a helmet.
 ​
 I hope the government will have stricter traffic regulations. These situations appear to be everywhere, at least, in where I live.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;ve been creating a playlist on Spotify with music from Southeast Asia, including both traditional and more recently recorded songs. I wanted to kindly ask you for any songs, artists, or records you would recommend me to add to the playlist. 
 I am grateful for any suggestions - except maybe noisy EDM or cheesy mainstream pop! :p It doesn&#x27;t matter from which Southeast Asian nation the music is from, I prefer explore songs that are sung in a native language, though, and not in English - if the music even includes voice recordings. 
 Regarding music which has been released in recent decades, I do particularly enjoy indie rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and post punk, among many other genres.
 When it comes to traditional/older recordings, I appreciate to explore basically everything! &#x3D;) 
 So, many thanks for any recommendations in advance! ;) Here&#x27;s a link to the playlist if someone&#x27;s interested in listening to it, too:

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently bought a few houseplants, such as the one in the photo. I have no idea what kind if plant it is, just that it is not doing so well. The leaves are turning brown and dropping off. 
 I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months, and kept it inside our apartment, watering every few days so that the soil doesn&#x27;t completely dry out. I&#x27;ve moved it outside as I thought it might need more sunlight, but it still is struggling.
 Any tips please? I hav no idea on how to care for plants in tropical climates. Also, what is this plant called?
 Thanks!

                              <span>My home country is the United States, I just finished a teaching contract in Thailand and plan to travel to Vietnam before coming back to Thailand for 2 months (I will extend my visa on arrival 1x). I have proof of my flight back to Thailand, but will I need to buy my ticket from Thailand to the USA to get on my flight to Vietnam? If so can I get a flight that is 2 months after my reentry into Thailand? If not I may need to get a flight where I can adjust the dates later. Let me know your suggestions if this is required. Thank you.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m considering visiting Hanoi and scoping out how accessible it might be for someone in a manual wheelchair who&#x27;d like to avoid driving. I currently live in Yosemite National Park as its only employee in a wheelchair, so I&#x27;m used to standards below what&#x27;s technically legal in U.S. cities, and am used to having difficulty with transportation, groceries, etc. I have some specific questions, but in general I&#x27;d really appreciate some perspective from people with mobility impairments of any kind. Examples of commentary I&#x27;d find very useful:
 Do expats see many disabled people among middle class society?
 Are we treated differently in ways that are negative?
 Would I have a harder time getting or maintaining a job because of a visible disability? (Will I be discriminated against more than I already am in the U.S.?)
 Would it be difficult to find an apartment that&#x27;s more or less accessible without it being considered a luxury or additional spending requirement?

                              <span>Long story short, I&#x27;m going to HCMC and will be meeting my Vietnamese girlfriend (who lives with her parents).
 I&#x27;d like to stay near District 1 but it&#x27;s my understanding most hotels won&#x27;t let her visit by law because we&#x27;re not married. She says it&#x27;s probably fine and she can talk to the desk and tell them she&#x27;s actually my GF to smooth it over but won&#x27;t research ahead of time for me which is frustrating since she&#x27;s so confident this will work anywhere (internet tells me otherwise).
 I found some sites listing &quot;girl friendly&quot; hotels, but they all look pretty dumpy (what you&#x27;d expect for that crowd).
 Does anyone know any decent 4-star or so hotels in District 1 that would allow her? I&#x27;ve started to email some places in the meantime. Budget is around $75-150USD/night which should be plenty. I&#x27;d like to not stay in a rundown brothel which many of the places that allow guests seem to resemble.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was in Vietnam for the first couple weeks of March and have been back in the U.S. for a little over a week now. I cannot stop thinking about my time there, and can&#x27;t seem to shake the feeling that I wish I was back. I was hoping this feeling would have subsided by now.
 My question is, for those of you who have been through this before,
 what do??

                              <span>Mom is visiting her family and will be arriving there tomorrow, an emergency came up with her relative and they&#x27;re no longer able to pick her up. She has to go from Da Nang to Hue, looked on Da Nang&#x27;s airport site for recommendations, does anyone here have any others? I saw Grab mentioned, but she barely knows how to use her smartphone, so that may be out. She also has quite a bit of luggage and two other individuals coming along ,so a large van will be needed. Is there anything I could do on my end (U.S.) to book something? Or just give her one of these numbers? Thank you.

                              <span>Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but this is the direct experience I&#x27;ve had whilst living in Hanoi for the last 4 months. I have my local vinmart, and another vinmart down the road and a circle k. I have to say, my experience of customer service has been the worst I have ever experienced. At the one store, the same girl (in her late 20&#x27;s), just looks at me and has this look of contempt, of anger almost, grabs my items, scans them then points to the screen in a really &#x27;I can&#x27;t be bothered, hurry up&#x27; way. She grabs my card scans it, prints the receipt and just hands it to me, not even a smile, a nod, a goodbye, no eye contact. The other day she takes the basket and just throws it on the floor. Then again, tonight, the other store, I go in, the young man didn&#x27;t say one word to me the entire time. No hello, no thank you, no goodbye (in Vietnamese.. I don&#x27;t expect English)... And just slammed the receipt on the table and continued chatting. My question is, are these people taught by their companies to observe any form of customer service? Is it because they are shy? (even though they stare at me and even once sighed at me for taking too long to use my phone app to pay even though their card machine wasn&#x27;t working)? Is it because they have no idea what to say to foreigners? Because I&#x27;ve been to other countries and a simple head nod, or even small gesture to acknowledge the customer and make him or her feel welcome isn&#x27;t so difficult is it? Now I rather hate going shopping now. It is not an enjoyable situation and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has the same experience in Hanoi. As a customer spending money in these stores I feel entitled to some form of customer service. I dont expect much, but a simple xin Chào, cam on or even a smile to the foreigners who are living and working hard here (or even tourists spending their money here) isn&#x27;t so difficult... Or is it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m aware that the internet is sometimes bad here. But is there any place/site to check if others complaining? So I would not feel alone &#x3D;)
 Or if it is just on my end - then it is time to fix some routers.

                              <span>I am staying in Ha Long Bay for a few nights, and will be back in Hanoi on friday before flying out. I am wondering where I can get a pith helmet for a good price/quality? I see many locals wearing them around here and I think they look awesome!
 I am referring to something like this:

 I also would like to know if I would appear as a silly farang for wearing one of these? Would it come off more costumey or just as a cool hat I got on vacation?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I was a in Hanoi. Just a regular massage, nothing special or &quot;happy ending&quot;. Ticket was 300K VND for 1.5 hour. I gave the receptionist (who handles the tip for the massage person) 50K VND. She said that&#x27;s too little, usually the tip is 150K, 200K or even 300K. Is this true for a regular massage? Whatever happened to tipping 10% of the bill? Why do I have to 50% to 100% of the bill?

 Is it how an American, British or European sees $10 (£10, €10)?

I have been recently Thailand and Taiwan and at both places it was mainly cash, card use was super limited and withdrawing cash was very expensive. I was kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t take more Euros/Pounds with me. How are the ATM fees in Vietnam and how common is it to pay with cards?

                              <span>Met a guy in his late 40’s from Vietnam this weekend and I’m trying to figure out how to spell his name. Over the phone I had no idea I wasn’t speaking to an American and heard Jim and didn’t think anything of it. When we met in person I realized he was of Asian descent and when I heard him say his name I realized it wasn’t Jim. 
 The best I could describe his name would be how the English word “You” would sound with an “M” at the end, Youm. He said it’s pretty common for people mistake it for Jim. But I’m having trouble figuring out how his name is actually spelled. 
 I’m hoping this is a common enough name that I could easily get an answer here. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Last time I brought the green &quot;Muối Ớt Chanh Nha Trang&quot; but it didn&#x27;t work so well. Please suggest the best ones I should bring this time.
  
Mắm tôm and similar should not be an option because I need to make sure I can check it on the airplane.
 
We usually use it to dip BBQ meats. Usually venison during hunting season or beef or pork ribs.
 
Great if I can order it online. I don&#x27;t live in HCMC but occasionally get there for a day or two.
 
 As for myself, what do you suggest for a very hot/spicy sauce? For me even the Cholimex &quot;tương ớt cay nồng&quot; is not very spicy though it&#x27;s almost there.

                              <span>What energy drink has the most caffeine that is widely available in Vietnam? Red Bull, at least in the United States, doesn&#x27;t have that much caffeine. I am looking for the most &quot;bang for my buck.&quot;
 In the US there is a drink called BANG that has 300 mg of caffeine plus guarana, vitamin B, etc. Is there anything like this in Vietnam?

 I just accepted a job offer and will be moving to Nha Trang soon. 
 Are there any insights, tips, fun secret places, ect that you can think of to share with me as I prepare to move? 
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of research, but I&#x27;ve found nothing beats anecdotal experience. 
 Much obliged!

                              <span>Hi friends,
 I am interested in moving to Vietnam and working for a year. I have quite sensitive health problems, blepharitis and quite serious eczema; right now I have them both fairly under control but am quite concerned that the pollution will cause it to flair.
 Ideally, I want to move to Hanoi, but am also considering Saigon as I heard it&#x27;s better air .I fear the air might affect my health problems. I would happily buy an air filter, mask, and try my best to avoid rush hour.
 Am I worrying too much? Is a year short enough to be relatively safe?
 What are your experiences, thank you!

                              <span>Trying to keep it general lest it gets flagged as advertising. I usually get very few matches (well under ten, and then mostly single moms or scammers). My guess is since my looks are very average, plus I&#x27;m on the extremely skinny side of things. Trying to figure out if it would be worthwhile to invest some money. What difference have the following made for you?
  
Paid account
 Having professional photos taken
 Anything else?
  
I&#x27;m in HCMC (and limit my search to there) if that makes any difference.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am heading to vietnam for 2 weeks of “backpacking” travel. All of my accommodations have been paid for already, I was just wondering how much cash I should take out for food basically and some souvineers. I keep seeing mixed numbers. I plan to do Ha Long Bay day tour and probably a few others. My travel style is usually budget travel and I rarely drink alcohol. If anyone can give me a ball park number it would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I was on a 12 hour ride for my first time in a sleeper bus and it was the most uncomfortable part of my trip. The bus was just shaky, the bus driver drove like a maniac, honking all the time, slammed on the breaks a lot and sending me flying off my seat a few times. I eventually ended up getting a headache, dizziness and just couldn’t sleep without worrying that this bus was gonna crash or something.

I have been here for about two and a half weeks - and we have not been off to the best start. Due to several factors, it&#x27;s looking very likely that my work permit and TRC will not finish in time. To top it off, it could cost me my job.
 I got a US FBI background check before coming, but unfortunately was informed on my second day in the country that it is invalid for Vietnam and I need to get a local check. I was informed there are two ways to go about this - apply for a residence certificate from the police and apply for the criminal check in person with that residence certificate, or do it all online via a private agency.

                              <span>I (21M) was born in 2001 in HCMC Vietnam and my mother&#x27;s side originated from the HCMC region whilst my father&#x27;s side originated from the North (he was born in Hanoi by the way). Even though both my parents, both my sisters (33F, 21F), and I have visited Hanoi several times, most of my mother&#x27;s side has never visited North Vietnam yet (north of 17th parallel), despite the fact most of her relatives still live in Vietnam (from what I have heard from my mother, her side is quite wealthy and many of her relatives are business owners). Many of them only went around the Southern third of Vietnam and the furthest North many of them has visited is Nha Trang/Dalat. In fact, for all of my mother&#x27;s relatives in the US (most came during the mid-late 1990s), none of them went above Nha Trang and half of them only visited Vietnam once or twice afterwards.
 Despite the fact I have only lived in Vietnam for 5 years before moving to Russia to study in 2006 and subsequently moving to the US at 11 in 2012, I have visited Vietnam several times afterwards (my most recent trip was in 2019 by the way), and I have visited the following places:

I am curious if it is common for Vietnamese people to have never visited the Northern half (North of 16/17 parallel)
 Plus, how common is it for Vietnamese Americans to never return to Vietnam or only return there once since moving to the US

                              <span>The plugs, electrical outlets, power strips etc. Why are they so hard to plug anything in?? Every time I try to plug in a lamp, charger, appliance it&#x27;s a battle of strength. Am I dumb? (Very possible) Is there a trick to it? (God I hope so) Two prong, three prong, doesn&#x27;t matter. I feel like I am going to break something every time! I even bought new power strips and it&#x27;s the same thing.

                              <span>Hi, I live abroad and would like to create a basic bank account in Vietnam so that I can buy stuff when I&#x27;m visiting. Just a free account with a debit card and a reliable mobile app. Can anyone recommend a good bank and product please?
 I want to buy train tickets (e.g. Ha Noi to Hai Duong) and someone told me that I should buy them in a bank mobile app. Do all banks have this feature?
 Last question, when Vietnamese people go to the shops and they &quot;chuyển khoản&quot;, do they mean paying with a card or is that some other way of paying that I don&#x27;t know?
 Thanks!

 Is it worth it even in the rain?

                              <span>We are a family of two adults and two tweens. We will be in North Vietnam for a week first week of June. Plan to be in Hanoi and Ninh Binh. On the fence about Ha Long Bay. The thought of it is exciting, and seems like a bucket list thing, but not sure if a 1 night cruise will be enjoyable if the bay is overcrowded. 
 Are there 5 star cruises there that take a less crowded route?
 We don&#x27;t care so much about spending the night on the boat but seems like that is the standard way to enjoy it.
 I hear there are other bays nearby but that they are not any less crowded.
 Tips?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m thinking about doing some tours for my next visit and wanted to know what everyone&#x27;s experiences were. Where are your must-go to places? I&#x27;m thinking about possibly staying for about 5 weeks and want to feel like I truly get to explore. I&#x27;m open to extending the trip if it&#x27;s worthwhile.

                              <span>Xin chào!
 I am visiting Hanoi from now until friday, the 31st of april, and I am interested in getting a custom tailored mens suit! I just want a jacket and pants, but if the price is good I could be convinced to get a shirt and/or vest too. I am thinking of choosing a charcoal wool/wool blend material.
 I am in my mid-20s but want it to be a versatile suit, so nothing either super vintage nor super modern; Regular length and medium-width notched lapels for the jacket and a slim-straight cut for the pants would be ideal. I also would like the suit to have some stretch, as I often get uncomfortable with the restrictive/stiff feel of store-bought suits.
 My budget would ideally be 5million VND, but a lot of talk online about this stuff is from pre-covid times, so I don&#x27;t know if that is a realistic number. Please correct my expectations if they are unrealistic.
 What tailors would be appropriate for what I am looking for, and what prices can I expect? Also: do I need to buy the fabric separately on my own, or will that be included in the tailor bill? Or would it be cheaper to buy on my own? 
 Any and all advice is much appreciated! Cảm ơn : )

                              <span>Hi everyone, I’m taking a trip to Vietnam soon and trying to workout my itinerary and would love some advice!
 So on the 4th of May, the plan is to take the night train from Dong Hoi up to Tam Coc. I’ve realised maybe 1 day is not enough for Tam Coc. Plus it’s a long journey from Tam Coc up to Ha Giang…
 After Tam Coc, the plan was to do the Ha Giang loop, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, however if we stay the extra day in Tam Coc, plus the long journey, I’m not sure we will have 4 days to do the loop. 
 We have to be in Hai Phong Bay at 11:30am on Monday 10th for a trip to Cat Ba.
 So here is my question:
 Should we skip Tam Coc all together, get up to Ha Giang and just do the loop for as long as we can? Should we do the 2 days in Tam Coc and just do a smaller loop of Ha Giang? Should I stick to 1 day in Tam Coc and the 4 day loop of Ha Giang?
 It looks like if we decide to go to Tam Coc, we will have to get a night bus up to Ha Giang. And of course then another night bus from Ha Giang down to Hanoi. Lot of night travel - is it too much? Should we ease up and save stuff for another visit?
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;ve been saving up for a trip for a very long time and I have my heart set on going to Vietnam. I&#x27;m 21F, Indian, and have a BA degree in History and am currently in my last year of law school. I have been seriously contemplating the idea of enrolling in a CELTA course and English as a foreign language full time, but this particular trip is going to have to be limited to 1 month. 
 I am looking at volunteering to to teach English or working with children in any capacity. I understand that my lack of certification and the duration of the trip is going to be an issue but I would be happy to be involved in any sort of volunteer work. I have previously worked as a college counselor for underprivileged children and been a paid tutor at an IELTS center in my city. 
 I have managed to find a few workaway opportunities that help you assist English language teachers and work on curriculum development but I&#x27;m not sure how legit they are. Please help connect me to any volunteer opportunities in the month of June.

                              <span>Hi! I have been riding motorbikes and scooters in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia without issues. Just arrived in Vietnam, rented a scooter in Mui Ne and within the first 15 minuntes I was taken to the police station. Tried to haggle the fine but in the end I left with 500k less in my pocket. 
 Given that I am not going to be able to produce a valid licence since Im already here and my IDP has only a B stamp: Are there any tricks to avoid being stopped or prevent the fine at all? I&#x27;m going to be renting bikes in Dalat, Da Nang, Nihn Binh and Ha Giang, so would rather not pay 500k each time.
 If not able to avoid police encounters, what would the minimum reasonable &quot;fine&quot; that I could settle for?

 Should I go for bigger store like Phong Vu, Nguyen Kim or try smaller store like Tin Hoc Ngoi Sao, Gear.vn. 
 Still trying to adjust to my new life here in Vietnam. Thank you all
 Edit: sorry I forgot to mention. I’m living in HCM now so any place in HCM is highly appreciated

 So I wanted to ask if anyone had alternative motorbiking suggestions in north Vietnam? Theres a 5 day window in our itinerary between stops at Sapa and Ha Long Bay, so any suggestions of beginner friendly routes lasting 2-5 days would be awesome!

                              <span>Hello everyone, my wife and I will be staying in phu Quoc for the next few days and are near the Ong Lang beach. We’re doing a relatively budget holiday so staying in a cheapesh place half an hour walk away from the beach.
 Most of the other discussion I see mention resorts for beaches but are the public beaches here good? My wife suffers a bit from too much sun so we wouldn’t mind having umbrellas and facilities at the beaches! 
 We will also spend a couple of days towards the south west of the island if anyone jas recommendations?
 Thanks a lot in advace!

                              <span>Hey fellow Vietnamese! I spent a wonderful 10 day trip in Hanoi a month ago. I loved it and I want to be back for another remote working period, maybe in Da Nang. My only concern is the internet speed, as my job relies heavily on Zoom meetings. Last time the connection was bumpy, I had some serious issues one day and I am concerned. I read the news and know about internet cables, but I prefer first hand information. So here I am, any feedback will be much appreciated. Thanks a lot!

                              <span>I’m travelling from Hội An to Hue and was hoping to travel along the Hai Van Pass.
 Is there a way I can rent a motor bike in Hội An or Da Nang and return somewhere in Hue? I won’t have the time to return it back to the original place. 
 Otherwise, would you recommend an alternative mode of transportation (like a bus) where I’d be able to stop and check out the view? 
 For additional context - I’m a budget travel so kinda looking for an affordable way to travel. Also, I’m an exercised driver in Canada but motorbikes are new for me so I’m not sure if this is a beginner friendly route.

                              <span>Hi everyone! This is directed at people who have traveled/are from Vietnam. 
 So I&#x27;m going to Ha Long Bay with my university and as part of one of the classes were doing a project (mini doc) about community perception of UNESCO world heritage sites and was wondering if anyone knew what the laws around filming in that area are. I wasn&#x27;t able to find much information other than for large film crews and as this is a school project where I and another classmate would be interviewing 2-3 locals I don&#x27;t believe we fall into that category. The setup would be minimal with a tripod, camera, mic, and potentially a very small light if needed. Any help or pointers would be appreciated!

                              <span>Xin chào everybody. My friend and I are in Hanoi and after a long trip on the train to get here we’ve been very thirsty. 
 We went to Beer Junction last night thinking we could hydrate with Bia Hoi but no one had heard of it!
 We asked around and looked online but there seems to be no sign of fresh keg beer. Don’t worry, we were able to hydrate with a few tasty green Saigon’s but today our pilgrimage continues. 
 Can anyone help? Does Bia Hoi still exist? 
 Thanks a lot 🍻

 Does this thing sting and is it aggressive? I&#x27;ve seen a few of them recently.

                              <span>So I just came across a post in this sub asking about their experience being a Vietnamese. I and the OP don&#x27;t have similar upbringings, so I don&#x27;t, and won&#x27;t, judge or say how they should feel.
 However, the comment section was flooded with people saying &quot;Vietnamese people are so money-focused, materialistic, etc etc&quot;, in a quite derisive way. And not just in that post either, I&#x27;ve seen such comments on multiple occasions, and they pretty much annoyed me.
 Yes, I admit, a lot of Vietnamese people are materialistic. But do you know why they are that way?

                              <span>Hi! 
 My girlfriend and I will be setting off on a 7 week trip in 2 weeks to South east Asia, including 3 weeks in Vietnam! Around week 5, we are hoping to take a 5 day trip round the Ha giang loop, and I wanted to discuss the logistics of this here. A few notes:
  
neither of us have ridden a motorcycle/moped before, but are confident car drivers. We have access to a 100cc motorbike for practice
 both of our UK drivers licences cover &quot;AM&quot; vehicles (motorbikes smaller than 50cc) but to ride up to 175cc, we need an A1 licence
 we plan to rent motorbikes in the islands of Thailand earlier in our trip, and gauge whether we think it is feasible to carry out 5 days of driving.
 We will be doing the Ha Giang Loop in early May
  
I guess my biggest question is what are our options?
 Should we try to get an A1 licence before we go? (It only takes a day AFAIK so we should be able to sort it before the trip) if we bother doing this, will we be able to get an IDP that works? I&#x27;ve heard conflicting reports regarding the state of IDPs
 Should we go as we are? In this case we&#x27;ll need to pay off police I&#x27;m sure which isn&#x27;t a huge deal but I&#x27;d be worried about getting our bikes impounded, especially half way through the loop
 Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>We will be visiting Bach Ma National Park in April and information is a little difficult to find. We initially thought we would do the five lakes trail, but since our daughter is only nine and, to be frank, rather short for her age, we don&#x27;t feel comfortable with the climbing part, as we are not sure she will be able to reach for the ropes. There are, supposedly, two trails to reach five lakes - do you also have to climb when you take the easier one (that is, not the adventure trail)? And has anyone done the peasant trail? I have not been able to find any information on this trail, except that it ends in a water fall and has the best likelyhood to see birds (which would actually be super nice). Does this trail involve any climbing, too?

                              <span>I&#x27;m Muppi, I&#x27;m 25 years old, a photographer, and a filmmaker from the beautiful Lakshadweep Islands in India. I create cinematic content for businesses to use on their social media platform. I have 6 years of experience in social media content curation. My passion for filmmaking has taken me to many places. I have been traveling and volunteering around India, which has been a fulfilling experience. 
 Where I grew up very connected to the sea, I grew up on the island life fixing boats, painting them and a lot of community works as apart of the local lifestyle there, as someone who loves nature and sustainability, I&#x27;m excited to travel outside of my country for the first time to put my skills to work for a meaningful cause. I&#x27;m passionate about balancing sports like slacklining, skateboarding, and surfing. I&#x27;ve spent a good amount of time sharing and teaching these skills. I&#x27;m also a documentary filmmaker and love to capture the beauty of nature and the stories of people who live in harmony with the environment.
 Few volunteering opportunities I did : - Helped a farmer for 3 months on his produce somewhere in the lush hills of western ghats in India. - Volunteered for an eco-festival in India to teach skating and help the festival crew. - Volunteered in the himalayas to help build a home-stay with a sustainable lifestyle. - Helped a few homestays and small businesses to provide quality content for their social media.
 Let&#x27;s work together to make a positive impact while exploring a new culture!

                              <span>Inspired by a comment thread in a recent post, I started to curiously think about the ideological/political alignment of Vietnamese people (or, at least the users of this subreddit): how do you perceive yourself ideologically, disregarding one&#x27;s support for the government - or lack thereof - as a political position itself?
 Do you appreciate traditional family values, free trade, private property rights, low taxation, strong military, social hierarchies, minimum social spending; are you into trade unions, social egalitarianism, progressive taxation, governmental support programs, free health care and education, gender equality? 
 Do you get thrilled by socializing the means of production, class consciousness, centralized planning, international proletarian revolution and anti-imperialism; or are you proudly &quot;anti-woke&quot;, support the interests of Vietnamese people over everything else, think that LGBTQ+ people should just go back to the closet and believe that climate change is a globalist hoax? Answer below!

                              <span>Hi there, everyone!
 I am docked at the cargo terminal just outside Ho Chi Minh for the next few days, and I&#x27;d like to get to see some of the city, despite my hellish work schedule. For that, I have some questions:
  
Will I be finding much open outside after 11pm?
 Is it realistic to try to use Grab to have someone pick me up? The app as of now gives me an estimate of 19-20min for someone to even show up, and I know the drive to Ho Chi Minh is like 45min-1h.
 Does anyone know a taxi driver who I can contact to perhaps strike a deal to bring crew members in and out for the next couple of days?
  
My company organizes a shuttle bus but it runs only until 8-9pm and I usually leave work at 10pm. I only have USD, and cards. No local currency at the moment. As per Vietnamese authorities, I am also not authorized to wander about anywhere other than Ho Chi Minh, and just a night pass cost me 10 USD, otherwise I&#x27;d have 10pm curfew.
 Please help!

 Background info: I ordered a package from the UK, it arrived into VNSGNA but got no updates for 4 working days. So I contacted VNpost and this is their response.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Vietnamese-American, and I feel as though I haven&#x27;t developed a really positive relationship with being Viet. But, I would like to relate better to my background.
 For me, I associate the Vietnamese language and Vietnamese life with a lot of negativity. I think of Vietnamese people that are just really focused on money, friends who have issues with their parents, adults that are constantly yelling with each other, and people who just take out their insecurities on others because they want respect or validation,
 I haven&#x27;t been able to have a lot of positive interactions and associations when it comes to being Viet. Viet life is just viewed as a source of turmoil to me sometimes.
 If you also feel this way about being Viet, please comment your emotions below.
 I know some people who have a good and healthy relationship to being Viet, but I&#x27;d consider them to be few. I&#x27;d really like to have a better relationship to being Viet, because I feel like a lot of us hate ourselves. Historically, it looks like a lot of us have just wanted to attach ourselves to other larger empires, such as China, France, or America. And, that makes me kinda sad. 
 The few people that I know that have a positive relationship to being Vietnamese come from good, healthy families. But, our community has a lot of trauma, and, to me, that makes those good families become uncommon.

                              <span>Having been on this sub for a month or so now, I’m realized that a lot of you are either really angry or just generally standoffish. I joined this sub to be able to live vicariously through everyone else traveling while I am not in VN and what I’ve experienced so far is a bunch of nasty people giving travelers shit for not giving every single detail about any given trip or cultural question. If I hadn’t already been to Vietnam and found out that the people there are, by and large, much more friendly and welcoming, this sub would 100% put me off from traveling there.
 (Of course, judging by some of the comments I’ve seen, a lot of you isolationists would be fine with it.)

                              <span>Hello all. I will be traveling to Vietnam for a business trip and the area I will be in does not have many English speaking people I’ve been told. I am wondering what social cues or cultural customs should I be aware of while there.

 I am visiting Hanoi for my first time very soon. I want to bring back jade jewelry for my mom, but I don’t speak Vietnamese fluently anymore. I am Vietnamese but lost the language growing up in the US. Is there any good jade jewelry stores that can accommodate in English?

Is it the case that I haven&#x27;t met enough Vietnamese people, or is it that the name just isn&#x27;t very popular anymore? 
 On a related topic, are there any names that have completely fallen out of favour because an infamous person held that name?

                              <span>We are traveling through Vietnam in April and will be on Phu Quoc for a few days towards the end of our trip. To compensate our daughter a bit for all the walking and looking at things, we had considered visiting the Aquatopia water park. As we know by now, the free shuttle bus has been discontinued, but we found out that the public bus #11 (which also runs from the airport) goes close enough to the cable car station. Only unfortunately it seems that the bus is also no longer running, at least I can&#x27;t find any information about it on the net (not even on the airport page). Has anyone ridden the bus lately or knows that it no longer exists? If it runs, we would look for a hotel along the bus line, otherwise we go, as actually planned, to Ong Lang and forget the thing with the park simply (I have no desire to pay 60€ for cabs to Cable Station and back, then we rather invest the money in as much ice cream as she can eat...). Or are there any other public busses, preferably from/to the Ong Lang area?

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m interested in buying some books and mangas from Vietnam, only issue doesn&#x27;t seem to be online the possibility for international western buyers (I&#x27;m from europe) to buy from Vietnam.
 So here I am, I&#x27;m looking for someone who&#x27;s interested in assisting me on a monthly basis, under a fee of course to buy, stock and then ship these mangas for me.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on a culinary journey lately, exploring the delicious world of Vietnamese breakfasts. We all know and love Pho and Banh Mi, but there&#x27;s so much more to the Vietnamese breakfast scene that often goes unnoticed. Recently, I&#x27;ve discovered a lesser-known but absolutely mouthwatering dish: Banh Cuon Cao Bang! 😋
 For those who haven&#x27;t tried it yet, Banh Cuon Cao Bang is a delicate and savory rice noodle roll filled with minced pork, wood ear mushrooms, and shallots. It&#x27;s usually served with a side of fresh herbs, cucumber, and a tasty dipping sauce. It has quickly become my go-to breakfast choice, and I&#x27;m eager to find more dishes like this!
 So, fellow foodies, I&#x27;m asking you: What are your favorite Vietnamese breakfasts, particularly the lesser-known ones?

                              <span>Hi r/Vietnam!
 I&#x27;m currently looking into getting the best out of my Phin filter as I recently got a decent hand grinder. People over at r/coffee tend to be pour-over and aeropress guys so I don&#x27;t read much about other brewing methods there. That&#x27;s why I decided to ask here. :)
 Any tips on getting the best brew? I personally haven&#x27;t tweaked much from what I usually do these past months when I first had a phin: Grind 14g of beans using setting 3 (medium fine) for my 6 click cheapo grinder that I bought over at Shopee, preheat the brewer and the glass, dump the grounds on the brewing chamber and shake to level, drop the press filter and press a bit (this one I&#x27;m not sure if necessary), pour hot-off-the-boil water about twice the volume of the coffee into the chamber to bloom the grounds and wait for 30 seconds, pour water to the brim of the chamber, then cover to retain the heat. Drip finishes at around 6 mins.
 I usually make coffee via pour-over and I love the different nuances in the process and how each factor affects the output of the brew, But I love the simplicity of the Phin and how no non-sense it is -it&#x27;s brute force coffee.
 Also, what should I look for if I want to buy a better Phin filter? And if you are a Timemore C2 user, what is your current grind setting?
 I would love to hear from you guys. :) Thanks!

 We are a group of students conducting a research project on circular economy (in electronics and fashion industry) and we would be grateful if you could take a few minutes to participate in our survey project.

 Only Cambodia, Vietnam, Brunei and East Timor starved their national teams in March.
 But hey, Cambodia is no superpower. Brunei is ASEAN&#x27;s minnow. East Timor also a minnow. People will not blame them if they didn&#x27;t schedule.
 But Vietnam? The nation that reached the final round of FIFA World Cup qualification and yet the national team is left starved with domestic league suspended for a month to serve the U-20 and U-23. For what? Professional countries will not interrupt domestic leagues for youth tournaments, only Vietnam does.
 Who is responsible for this? Who deliberately starved the national team?
 Shameful.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ll be in Ninh Binh next week and it&#x27;s calling for a lot of rain. I was hoping to do a good amount of treking and sightseeing but will all the rain keep me inside? Should I just stay in Hanoi and enjoy the city life? I have a torn ACL so I&#x27;m hesitant to be out in the rain incase I slip. 
 Let me know what you guys think.
 ​
 Cam on!

 What is the easiest route? Digital nomad? Business Visa? Marriage? Apply for duel citizenship? Move to another country together?

 If it were you, would you rather spend more time in Hanoi, Cat Ba, or Tam Coc? Looking for any and all insight!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m visiting Vietnam next month with my partner and our five month and am trying to finalise our plans.
 We fly out of HCMC so we&#x27;re planning on Da Lat being the last place we visit and then getting bus to HCMC the night before our flight (we&#x27;ve both visited HCMC before so don&#x27;t feel the need to go again).
 Just trying to figure out how many days to spend in Da Lat, i.e. should we do 2 nights, three days or one night, two days bearing in mind we have a small child with us so will probably be sticking to Da Lat rather than going on any trips in the nearby area. 
 What do people think?

                              <span>Hi ,I have been to Vietnam four times , love the place . The food( along with many other things)is spectacular .I have been trying to bake Banh Mi at home . I&#x27;ve had medium success but miles away from a proper Vietnamese Bahn Mi. Is there a Vietnamese baker out there somewhere who would share the recipe. I&#x27;m really confused - some recipes use egg ,milk ,vitamin c powder . What is the correct recipe ?

                              <span>Hi! I (30F) will be solo travelling through Vietnam in April and I am hoping to do a Ha Giang Loop motorbike tour. I am struggling to find good recommendations. Here are my requirements:
 - Easy rider who drives safe and is friendly
 - Small group tour (max 8 people)
 - Staying in authentic homestays 
 - Off the beaten path/away from other tourists as much as possible (acknowledging that I am a tourist myself)
 - 4 days/3 nights would be ideal but open to slightly longer
 Also, I will be coming from Sa Pa, so any advice about transport between Sa Pa and Ha Giang is welcome. Thanks so much!

 Has that hit Vietnam yet? If I got him a record player, could he buy records to use? Anything else a young 20something kid who likes music and photography would want from the states?

                              <span>I’ve been shopping at the same liquor store for about a year now and have developed a very kind relationship with the elderly Vietnamese couple that own the place. It’s limited to just my time in the store throughout the week, but I’ve always loved Vietnamese culture so I’ve gotten to know them and their story better lately. I’ve also recently started learning the most very basics of Vietnamese. Would it be rude to maybe greet them in their native language once I’ve got enough practice?

                              <span>Hi, my gf and i are looking at apartments to move out but we are not 100% sure about the process. We&#x27;d love to know how we can avoid scams or getting ripped off as well as step by step process after we have chosen an apartment. What are the signs that we are being scammed? We are not going thru an agent since i was told they charge exorbitant prices. I was also told not to pay deposit without a deposit paper, renting contract and at least have a look at the apartment.

                              <span>Getting married to a Vietnamese lady. We are both 30 this year. I am curious about the whole marriage age superstition thing. We wanted to get married next year but we will be 33* (Vietnamese age plus 1 year for Tet) which is a no go according to her mum. I think we then said let’s do it this year but that was also bad and realistically my family couldn’t make it to Vietnam this year. However, we didn’t want to wait until 2025. So after some consultation with a pháp sư her mum said this year was ok and we will have ancestor welcoming (me?) into the family this year on the day of our legal marriage abroad and the wedding ceremony in Vietnam next year, but since it’s unlucky we are just having a “party” not a wedding ceremony. I just found the whole thing kinda confusing. Is this normal across Vietnam?

                              <span>I (18f) am trying to find ways to develop a relationship with my boyfriend’s (20m) parents. We’ve only been dating a couple months, but I’ve already met his parents, and while they are very kind to me, I haven’t had a full real conversation with them. It’s always in passing that we exchange words. I’m white and don’t know much about Vietnamese culture or customs, so I’m not sure exactly how to approach them for fear of accidentally coming off as rude or ignorant. I love my boyfriend a lot, and I go to his house and see them pretty often. He doesn’t have a very close relationship with his family, and even they don’t talk much outside of them asking if he’s eaten or where he is, so I’m not sure if he’d be able to help me here. It means a lot to me, having them like me, as I see us having a long future together. Does anyone have any tips or things I should know/necessary knowledge like what is or is not respectful? Or gift ideas to thank them for letting me stay at their house? Anything would be great. Thank you!

                              <span>hello good people of Vietnam. I fell in love with Saigon when I visited earlier this month, so much so that I am returning for a month early April.
 Aside from bars, coffee shops and language clubs, which I will definitely be making use of this time around, was wondering if anybody had any pointers for a 20-something to make friends in the area
 thank you 🙂

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to Hanoi for 5 days and HCMC for 5 days and I&#x27;d really appreciate knowing someone there who&#x27;d be willing to give me some opinions on places to go and things to do. 
 I&#x27;d like to meet a fellow redditor over some drinks and food and hopefully make a new friend during my trip if you&#x27;re comfortable with that as well. 
 If not, I&#x27;d still appreciate the advice 🙂
 EDIT: As an introvert, it&#x27;s a lot harder for me to make new friends and approach random people and start a conversation which is why I made the post.

                              <span>The Chams, if I remember right, with the fall of Champa, were separated into three groups practising different religions. The Central Chams have largely retained their Hindu belief, although this is practised under a form called &quot;Ba La Mon&quot;. The Southern Chams in the Mekong Delta have largely adhered to Sunni Islam and they are the only ethnic group in Vietnam to be Muslims.
 The third Cham group, however, practise a complex religion called &quot;Bani&quot;. It was thought to be traced from Persian traders (Persia/Iran was converted to Shia Islam by Shah Ismail I), who spread their Shia Islam to the community during the Vietnamese shogunates (Trinh-Nguyen). However, Bani is unique that it is so synchronised with other religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and even Han and Kinh (Vietnamese) people&#x27;s folk traditions that it lost most of the original Islamic belief.
 The Bani community is small today but their religious practise has ignited discussions. Some groups believed that they are actually Muslims but with a different characteristic. But some other (including many Banis) disagree with the classification of Bani as a separate Shia Islam sect and instead insist that they are Banis and not Muslims. There is a 2006 documentary called &quot;A Strange Islam&quot; by Agnes De Feo about this community, which put their existence to spotlight.
 Question here is, are Bani people Shia Muslims or just Banis? And what kind of religion Bani is?

                              <span>Hey!
 Warning: tourist question. I&#x27;m heading to Vietnam and gonna stay for a month at a time. I&#x27;m looking for somewhere I can find reasonably priced 1-month rentals in a big city. I&#x27;ve used Airbnb before but it&#x27;s overpriced usually. 
 Anyone got any ideas, websites or groups I can check out? I have some vietnamese friends that can help me with interpreting if there are some good local alternatives. 
 Thanks!

This brand is very new here. I want to know if what they are saying is true and how&#x27;s the performance of vicem, would you really recommend it? Thanks

                              <span>Just some background information, I have 6 years of experience teaching and I was in Vietnam in 2017 for a year.
 Is it still the case that one can find a job in the country easily? 
 Uk citizen with all the relevant documents notarised etc.
 Not in any rush, I have plenty of savings.

                              <span>TLDR: My experience in Vietnam is a treasure on my heart. 
 (Rant)I spent time there a few years back. An American in your beautiful country. I think of the smells, the people, the beauty, and the food. Your kindness to me and my travel mate was second to none, from the south to the north. I know it may be required of your culture to be &quot;nice&quot; when you really want to say what needs to be said, but I saw a humble care of the world in which the Vietnamese live, which includes naive tourists. Always kind to me, which I am not used to.
 As an American, I am so thankful for your hospitality. From my perspective, I would have so much animosity towards people like me. Maybe you keep it to yourselves. Or maybe, you just want to move on. A humble strength in family and kindess. 
 Vietnam is one of my fondest memories. I treasure it. I spent a night on a boat in Ha Long Bay. Although I was drunk and silly, the crew invited me and my girlfriend to the kitchen. Vietnamese food and a strange, ridiculously strong sangria. One of the greatest experiences in my life. It was like 345 in the morning!
 I got to sleep in. And the crew, who I think several were celebrating birthdays, were up at like 5! Being hungover on a boat while working sounds impossible. They did it, cause they had to. Tourism is likely the (I don&#x27;t know) biggest money makers for Vietnam these days I imagine.
 My last night, I got a tattoo on my inner left forearm in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh). I hear that many people tired of their tattoos when they see them everyday. For me? I wax nostalgic and think of how amazing Vietnam was. How it is. And how it treated me and my friend. 
 Not only do I have a great experience. But the people of Vietnam make me want to be a better person. I try everyday. Be humble. Be kind. Make good pho. Regrettably, the latter tastes like salty water. I&#x27;ll keep trying.
 I miss Vietnam. Thank you.

                              <span>I’m a Viet-Kieu who happened to grow up with a very strict Asian mom. I know my mom uses tough love on us but I’m not sure if my mom went out of line disciplining my sister and me.
 These are some of the things she did:
  
She spat and bit me after I didn’t want to wear formal clothes to my friend’s birthday party at age 8. She then clapped and laughed at me after poking holes on my pants with scissors. I cried so hard that day.
 
She cut my pajama pants for refusing to wear anything above the knees.
 
Told me “it was such a huge mistake giving birth to you”.
 
Pour food on head after refusing to eat( I was three at that time).
 
Beat my sister so hard she bled from her mouth when she was 4-5 y.o.
 
Kicked me in the back.
 
Called me “thang dong tinh”( similar to the f-slur) and splashed tea at me for reason number 2 (luckily the tea was cold at that time).
 
Screamed and calling me “thang cho”( a dog) for not bringing a ruler to school.
 
 This happened to me when I was 6-12 y.o. My sister told me my mother was abusive but I don’t think she was since I’ve seen some of my Vietnamese relatives’ parents who did stuffs way worse than my mom did.

                              <span>Hello, for context I&#x27;m người Việt born in the US (việt kiều i guess haha), moved to Saigon for ages 4-12, then back to the states for the rest of middle school, high school, uni, and now work here. My parents are from mixed backgrounds, dad a boat refugee from a military family and mom a very upperclass business family in real estate. I&#x27;ve considered moving back after getting a job offer but ultimately decided not to purely because it wouldn&#x27;t further my career, at least not in the industry I&#x27;m in. Really did consider it though since I got lots of family there too
 That being said, I do have very mixed feelings of the current government. On one hand, they freed us from all our colonizers which is something I think all of us feel very proud of and it just feels liberating, you know, knowing…</span>

 For my job it&#x27;s important to use ChatGPT, as far as Microsoft blocked the product for Vietnam, I should use it via VPN and Telegram bots.
 However, maybe you know a more convinient way?

                              <span>It probably hasnt been discussed on here much, but curious to see thoughts on the gender disparity.
 Vietnam has the 5th highest in the world , with 111.4 male births (currently) to every 100 females: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sex-ratio-at-birth?tab&#x3D;table
 This has been a social trend in the country for 30-35 years, but it has accelerated dramatically over the past 10-20 years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Vietnam#/media/File%3AVietnam_population_pyramid_01.04.2019.png
 Any thoughts on this? I can imagine some pretty concerning social issues arising from this in future (if not already)

                              <span>Sorry if this is not an appropriate place to post this, but I wasn’t sure what other subreddit to post this to.
 I met a Vietnamese guy on a tour last year in South America. We stayed in touch and when I went over to Thailand, we decided to meet up there. I’ve noticed that he is not that polite to hotel and restaurant staff as well as drivers. For example, he doesn’t say thank you when staff brings his drink or food to the table ever. He doesn’t say thank you when we are leaving the restaurant and they are saying thank you and goodbye. He’s not mean to them or anything, he simply ignores them. We hired a driver and instead of walking a few meters to meet the driver, he insisted the driver come into a very tight spot even though it was super inconvenient for the driver to have to back out. I tried to tell him we can just walk up to a more convenient spot and he said no, that we are paying the guy so we will wait for him to come to us.
 I’m wondering if this is just a cultural thing? I am ethnically Vietnamese, however I grew up in the US and my attitude is completely different (I’ve also worked in the hospitality industry so maybe I’m hypersensitive to this). I grew up being taught to be extra nice to hospitality workers because they work very hard but make very little. I get a sense from him that he sees them as beneath them. Is this a common attitude towards staff in Vietnam?

                              <span>Although there is some similarity to other neighboring countries, our culture as well as clothing still have clear differences. For example, Vietnamese smoke Thuốc Lào, eat Trầu, dye their teeth black, wear darker color outside and colorful inner Áo Mớ Ba Mớ Bảy, and hair keep hair loose. In clothing, we have many hats like Nón Quai Thao, Nón Đinh Tự, Toàn Hoa etc. Just like the chest wrap skirt in the video, we Vietnamese use it with a Round collar robe - Áo Viên Lĩnh inside with hair covering fabric; while others don&#x27;t.
 The project takes 1 year to complete and more than 5000$. All are self-funded. If you are interested, please support the full video here on Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;B06Pvic1TM0.

 There is one phrase written in Nôm script, can anyone guess what it is? 😋

                              <span>Hello,
 I don&#x27;t want to be disrespectful, but I have a sincere question. 
 I spent a night in a sleeping bus in a lower cabin and the guys from the company had no choice but to sleep on the ground between cabins. One guy spent the entire night spreading his legs right and left, and doing so, he was touching my bottom all night long. I could not sleep because it made me feel really inconfortable. I tried many times to push his legs, but he would do it again, and again and again. 
 I don&#x27;t understand, because I thought it was very disrespectful to touch people of the opposite sex?
 Is it normal? How should I react if it happens again? Can I ask him to stop doing it or would he be angry? 
 Thank you for your answers

                              <span>Serious question here. Why do so many Vietnamese burn garbage? Outside of the traffic situation, burning of things and the resulting air pollution it causes is without a doubt the most negative aspect of this amazing country. I don’t get it as everything I have seen on fire could have easily been put on virtually any curb for pickup by the garbage crews at least in the cities where smoke impacts a lot of people. 
 It makes me so mad as it not only affects my health, but more so, that of babies and children who are more vulnerable plus ALL of you who live here. Why is this not something the government is cracking down on as the trickle down health effects surely are taking a toll on the nation...even just cognatively as it effects your brain too. Plus, who wants to constantly be getting whiffs of burning plastics and whatnot on the daily? It is 2023 and we KNOW better, so why the ignorance in this particular area here? 
 If you burn things on the regular basis…why? Can you please shed some light as to your motivations? 
 From Wikipedia:
 “The World Health Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.[6] Studies published in March 2019 indicated that the number may be around 8.8 million.[127] A 2022 review concluded that air pollution was responsible for 6.67 (5.90–7.49) million premature deaths in 2019. It concluded that since 2015 little real progress against (superordinate) pollution, which remained at ~9 million earlier deaths, can be identified.[128][19]00090-0-19) Causes of deaths include strokes, heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections.[6]&quot;

                              <span>As the title suggests. I’ll be arriving in Hanoi on an afternoon and would be looking to navigate to Ha long bay that very moment.
 Planning on spending an evening + next day there. Recommendations for a day cruise or a cruise which maybe starts in the evening and goes up until the next day in the evening?
 Looking to do activites such as Kayaking and swimming.

                              <span>Hoping someone has some experience on what may be the best approach. For my last two days in Vietnam, I&#x27;m struggling to decide on two different scenarios. I&#x27;m not deterred by long days and aim to do as much as I can. I&#x27;ve heard Ha Long Bay is more touristy, so I&#x27;d like to avoid that if possible. But here are what I&#x27;ve found to be the best scenarios - so if there are other options that I am not thinking of, please share!
 Option One: Day trip excursion from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay. Lasts ~12 hours and allows me to book another one day excursion from Hanoi for the second day. I feel like this will result in roughly 6 hours total of travel back and forth for each day, so seems like I am not getting the most out of my days. But, may allow me to see something else I haven&#x27;t considered for a day trip.
 Option Two: Depart early AM via train or bus to Cat Ba Island, arriving midday. This allows some brief exploration of Cat Ba National Park. However, the following day it is unclear to be me if I can actually see Lan Hay Bay. I will be leaving out of Hanoi at 2300hrs that night, so need to be back to the airport around 2000hrs. It looks like my options to get back to mainland are to ferry at 1530hrs (ending my day prematurely) or at 1730hrs (getting back too late). Would it even be possible for me to see Lan Ha Bay in this time? The only thing I&#x27;ve found only is departing from 0800 and not arriving back to the island until 1500, which means my only option would be to take the ferry back at 1730. I&#x27;d like to make this option work, if I can, to see the mostt of the island but looks like the timing doesn&#x27;t quite work :(
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Thinking of visiting in August/September and keeping my trip focused on Hoi An and Huy. I’m looking for long walks and beautiful scenery, good food, great cafes I can read in for hours and people watch. No budget. As an aside, watched The Scent of Green Papaya years ago and thought the scenery was gorgeous, looking for that kind of ambience. Thoughts? Recommendations? Naysayers? All appreciated, thanks!
 Edit: no, not switching my trip to Boulogne. Ignore the movie set dreams.

                              <span>Hey fellow travelers! I recently arrived in North Vietnam and I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for off-beat places to explore. While Hanoi was amazing, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of the city and immerse myself in the beautiful nature of this country.
 But my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I arrived at Ha Long Bay. The pictures I saw online were nothing like the reality I experienced. It was crowded with tourists and heavily commercialized. I needed to find a hidden gem!
 That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m turning to you, fellow travelers, for help. Do you know of any hidden spots in North Vietnam that are off the beaten path? Maybe a secret waterfall, a secluded beach, or a quaint village with friendly locals?
 I&#x27;m on the hunt for something unique and authentic. Something that&#x27;s not overrun with tourists and where I can truly experience the beauty of Vietnam. So, if you have any recommendations, please share them in the comments below!
 Let&#x27;s help each other escape the tourist trap and discover the hidden treasures of North Vietnam.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I wanted to kindly ask for any advice and recommendations regarding possible job opportunities in the tourism/hotel sector of Da Nang/Hoi An. I am 32 years old, originally from Germany. I have BA degree in Southeast Asian and American Studies. I am considering to do a second degree in Tourism/Hotel-Management at an online university in order to be able to work while studying. 
 My overall CV has a lot of &quot;holes&quot; in it, because in my 20s I spent quit a fair amount of time traveling around the globe. I worked seven years as a freelance journalists with a main emphasis on tourism; had countless jobs in restaurants; worked for a company specialized in book trade; and, more recently, been employed as a social worker at a school in Germany. I also have my own little side hustle going on, selling records/cds/cassettes. In addition, I speak Indonesian and Malay, and I am currently trying to advance my Vietnamese language skills. 
 In the near and distant future, I&#x27;d like to live and work in Da Nang. I spent a fair amount of time in the city in the recent decade, and I feel very much at home there. My girlfriend lives in Da Nang, too, and we are in committed long term relationship. Therefore, I am considering to find a suitable occupation for myself in the city, and I can picture myself doing a good job in the tourism sector. Online, though, I can barely find any job ads. 
 I&#x27;d be very grateful if anyone could give me some honest feedback if I&#x27;d be able to get a work permit in the tourism sector in Da Nang with my background; and if so, I&#x27;d appreciate any tips on what to keep in mind, what to be careful about, and so forth. 
 Thank you so much in advance! &#x3D;)

I had to change primary doctor so no appointments until last quarter of the year. Anyone know where I can walk in to get this form signed by a doctor?

                              <span>Apparently I&#x27;m providing technical support as a volunteer for a ceremony in my University (NEU Career Week) and i&#x27;m tasked with making Powerpoint slides, lighting, etc.There will be parts where music is needed such as giving prizes, awards, introduction of sponsors (yes, money is involved).
 I was going to use video game themes for them, some are actually from Nintendo. But upon reading about copyrights, i thought it&#x27;d be much safer top use something different.
 My question is if I use a popular song in the ceremony, will there be accusations of copyright infringement? I&#x27;d like apologize if I asked something dumb, but I&#x27;m a 2nd year student, still got a lot to learn, and this is my first time doing such important thing.

                              <span>👋 Hi Please don&#x27;t laugh at me but my partner sent me 2 packs of Viet pancake mix and a bottle of fish sauce. I&#x27;m so rubbish at cooking but trying to learn and I&#x27;m not doing to bad. I just need a simple recipe for the pancakes. I have bacon and shrimp and spring onions for the pancakes.
 The fish sauce dip I have nooooo clue what it&#x27;s supposed to taste like. I&#x27;ve never tasted fish sauce before. I have lemon 🍋 sugar and the fish sauce. I don&#x27;t have any chili flakes as I&#x27;m making it for my 8 year old daughter too (also I&#x27;m a stereotypical English WF who can&#x27;t handle too much heat! Wahhh ) So any simple step by step for the dip please 🙏 My partner is coming over to visit and I want to impress him.

                              <span>I will be visiting VietNam very soon on vacation. My husband and I have a few tour guides and drivers that are helping us on our tour of the country. We are obviously planning to tip generously for their service but we thought an additional small gift from the US might be a nice touch. Obviously nothing too elaborate but a nice token as a friendly cultural exchange. I&#x27;m looking for ideas of something easy to pack. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I just wanted to share an interesting story of what happened to us at Gibbon trek. We have tracked down family of four female, male and two babies all foraging and playing. They seem to have a lot of fun amongst each other, especially the babies. About 30 minutes of watching them they have decided to leave the tree and go further. Male Gibbon went directly above us and let it rip, the poop showered us, my camera, clothes, and my girlfriends clothes. Anyone got similar experience with Gibbons? Our guide told us this never happened on his treks, so I&#x27;m just wondering. Amazing experience anyway, would get pooped on by a wild Gibbon any day. 10/10.

                              <span>Just looking at something like a passport power index doesn’t answer this question because almost every European country requires a visa for Vietnamese tourists. 
 But there is a big difference in how hard it is to get a Schengen visa vs. say a Moldovan visa.
 What are some of the easiest European visas for Vietnamese to get?

 I&#x27;ve been meaning to discuss a pressing issue that has been on my mind for quite some time now – the uncontrolled building development in Vietnam, particularly the excessive construction of high-rise apartments. It seems that the rapid urbanization and economic growth in recent years have led to a boom in real estate development, but sadly, this has come with a slew of negative consequences.
 To start with, the infrastructure in cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City is severely lacking and has not kept pace with the construction of these massive apartment complexes. The result?

                              <span>So, my parents are from rural Vietnam but ethnically, we are Chinese and I thought it would be cool to go through family birth records and trace up the generations to figure out when we migrated to Vietnam. How would one go about this? Is it possible that records may have gotten lost over many generations into the past? Also, please let me know if someone knows of a better subreddit to ask this on.

                              <span>Hello,
 Sorry if this seems off-topic but my friend has reached top 10 in the vietnamese league server as well as Challenger in both EUW and NA. I think she has a shot at Saigon Buffalo or another pro vietnamese team but besides emailing them what are some ways she could get her foot in the door?
 I&#x27;d ask in the leagueoflegends website but most of them are North American players so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be any vietnamese players. I also think its much harder to break in the vietnamese pro circuit than it is in other regions.
 Any advice appreciated. I can provide her accounts if need be.

                              <span>I have seen foreigners quite aggressively pushing cosmetic products in big malls such as Aeon Tân Bình and Vincom (D2) 
 They sweettalk and use different tropes to push their goods. There is a part of conversation between my wife and one of the sellers in Vincom plaza
 Seller (foreigner): You know today is my bday, so if you buy cream name I will give you another cream for free.
 Shop assistant (VNese) Oh, wow, boss, really? That’s such a good deal!
 They were pretty polite and nice at the start, but completely lost us at this birthday script. The VNese shop assistant’s reaction was so fake, it’s funny.
 Have you personally met such people and what do you know about it?

                              <span>Hi everyone, we unfortunately were not allowed on our flight from Thailand to Vietnam due to a damaged passport. We do have a flight out of a Hanoi to Tokyo planned in about 6 days.
 Since we were unable to travel on our flight to Vietnam, we are opting to get an emergency passport as the US consulate in Thailand.
 After receiving an emergency passport, would we have any issues trying to fly to Hanoi so we can transfer and get to Tokyo on our flight?

                              <span>Yes, I get it, Donnie Yen publicly support the 9 dash line, I dont like that too … but for real, would banning it do any justice at all when the Vietnamese government themselves, indirectly, publicly, proudly and casually “fund” China’s ambition in the South China sea with hundreds of billions of dollars of economic projects every damn year? Lmao? Not to mention all the Chinese movies and shows that were sponsored and sanctioned by the State and their money, are all over the Vietnamese TVs. 
 Those that know will boycott the movie, the average people dont know shit and will watch it. And watching it doesnt mean you support Donnie Yen’s view … and since the economy is going through a recession, the movie industry is dwindling, the International Court of Arbitration denied the 9 dash line’s legitimacy… why not show it, scrapping some billions VND while at it. 
 Sorry for the rant.

                              <span>Hi I’m currently in Da Lat and got bitten by a Cat about 2 hours ago, the hospital I need to go to get a Rabies Shot doesn’t open until morning.
 Does anyone know the rough cost of a Rabies Shot?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be in HCMC from 26 to 29th of this month, and as a solo traveler it would be nice to grab a drink or 2 and meet new people - are pub crawls a thing in HCMC? Otherwise, can anyone recommend good spots for a solo traveler to grab a drink? I&#x27;m not particularly interested in the Bui Vien St kind of nightlife, but rather, good quality bars or pubs with a nice and social atmosphere.
 Thanks!

 what is the better way to get around Sapa, hire a local taxi for daily rates or ask the limousine company if they provide private car service while I am there. 
 any input is greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

But a day later, on all online shopping applications, that stuffs appear continuously. Also, on all social media applications, topic relates to it also pop up. Wondering whether smart phone is reading our mind or just a coincidence

 I&#x27;m considering a study exchange in Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City. The exchange would last about 6 months. I estimate I would need roughly 6 packets of Medikinet (active substance is Methylphenidate). Is that too much too risk for? Is it generally legal to bring that stuff in - in such amounts - every packet has 30 tablets (25mg per each tablet)? What procedures would and should I go through? And finally, what kind of documents - and how prepared - should I bring with me?
 Thx for the answers. 
 PS: I don&#x27;t think I wanna risk with a bribe haha

                              <span>Good day. In the middle of a 6mo trip and as planned we are flying to Hanoi on Friday. We thought my spouse had a muscular injury from weightlifting at a hotel gym 10 days ago. Long story short- he needs a cervical MRI for progressive triceps weakness. Where can we go that would order an MRI that we could get in a timely fashion. I work in medicine and we have and we have exhausted pharmacy options. I know he needs an MRI, so I am specifically looking for a clinic/facility where he could be evaluated and get referred for a n MRI. Thank you.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t been to vietnam since I was 5, and even then it was only for a couple months. It&#x27;s been a very long time and I grew up in US. Im finally going back after many years but Im worried I might not be immune to some things or my vaccinations are not up to date. Is there any shots I should absolutely get before visiting?

                              <span>Hello I am half black man in early 20s and have a trip planned to visit in a few months , I am truly in love the landscape and culture , i I don’t speak the language but plan to really make a effort. I’m curious if it would be hard for me to go on dates at coffee shops and things like that with women around my age are Vietnamese scared of black people ? There is a big mix of opinions on how Vietnamese women feel towards black men , I’d like a honest answer , and best suited city for me to go to ? Thanks 🙏🏼( edit) I never have expected so much different perspectives and insight , thank you to everyone for there input and to the people who continue to give me insight , I’m excited to go on my journey and I promise to treat the country and people with the up most respect ! Cảm ơn lòng biết ơn

                              <span>Hello! The title kinda speaks for itself. I&#x27;m in Vietnam at the moment and whilst here I was hoping to find some factory seconds from brands that I would normally find back home in Australia. Specifically, Vivobarefoot (a barefoot shoe brand), Patagonia, Arcteryx, North Face, etc. I&#x27;m in the north near Hanoi but I&#x27;m happy to travel!
 Any information or sharing of contacts would be appreciated. I&#x27;m not looking to resell, and I&#x27;m mostly needing the gear for trekking. The shoe brand for instance, they are one of the only brands that manafactures in my size (US15), so if I could stock up whilst here that would be helpful. Thanks all.

                              <span>So after all the searching I did through this sub and other sites, I settled with using Xoom since I already have a Paypal account + they&#x27;ll deliver directly to their house using sacombank. Parents have been using someone at a local Vietnamese market for awhile and they&#x27;d be saving fees if I just did it. What I&#x27;m confused now about is how to enter the address.
 I have the address from my parents and this is what is on each line. I guess this is how my parents have always addressed it when they send something, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s properly formatted. Their family lives in a rural area. Thank you!

I&#x27;m going to make an effort to buy good gifts, and they are not cheap. My question is: is the first meeting more important or more special than the next ones? I mean, if I give them better gifts on the first meeting than on the second meeting, will it be strange? Or will they expect the gifts to become better and better? I&#x27;m very confused. Could someone help? Thank you!

 I am afraid about giving a better (and more expensive) gift for grandpa than dad and it becomes an unpleasant situation. What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Viet Kieu spent the pass week here in Hanoi, Sapa and Ninh Binh. Is it just me or the locals are rude and loud. Not the ones working and providing service to you, but the actually locals that goes to the same sites you’re sight seeing. I think they are local because of their dialect. In Sapa, went to Fansipan. Omg they were pushing in line sandwiching everyone, talking and screaming so loud. The men would smoke when there is a no smoking sign. For Buddhas sake you’re at a temple. 
 Then at Tac coc at Bai Dinh temple, signs are everywhere to be silent or quiet as possible. But these ladies are yelling screaming from a distance. Like can’t you read or have some respect?
 Ok done ranting. Maybe it’s the norm for them. But kinda rub me the wrong way.

                              <span>Mình là sinh viên nữ, mình chạy chiếc lead nên khá to. Tối mình chạy trên đường đi học về do đông xe quá nên mình chen vào làn đường ô tô. Lúc mình chen vào giữa 2 chiếc ô tô (1 đen, 1 trắng)thì khoảng trống giữa 2 xe nhỏ lại do chiếc xe trắng chạy áp sát vào. Mình thấy vậy nên rồ ga vượt qua và tông cong kính chiếu hậu xe trắng. Do hoảng và xe đông nên mình không biết dừng xe ở đâu để giải quyết rồi rồ ga bỏ đi. Mọi người có thể cho mình xin lời khuyên được không ạ? ( Em rất xin lỗi vì việc lái xe ẩu và cách giải quyết vấn đề không đúng mực của em nếu chủ xe có nhìn thấy post này). Xin lỗi mọi người vì hành vi thiếu văn hoá khi tham gia giao thông của mình.

The gallerie owners told that I could bargain but I was wondering what would we reasonable/expected? I read online that I shouldn&#x27;t pay more than 30% of the asking price, is that a fact?

                              <span>My first week here, I pet my (then) fiancee&#x27;s family&#x27;s pet dog. The mutt bit me on the finger and I had to go for 5 rabies shots.
 It was a harrowing welcome to Vietnam, let&#x27;s just say that!
 I&#x27;ve been chased by a couple aggressive dogs since that, and seen some wild looking dogs just roaming the streets that I don&#x27;t want anything to do with. 
 I refuse to pet or put myself in any sort of vulnerable position even with friendly dogs. 
 I grew up with pet dogs in the west. To say I&#x27;m a dog lover is an understatement. I miss my family&#x27;s dog so much while I&#x27;m here. 
 I never would have thought that I would develop a fear of dogs, but I feel it growing every time I have to walk past an unknown dog on the street. 
 Rabies scares me more than the dogs to be honest... 
 Luckily the family dog didn&#x27;t have rabies and is still alive. But 5 shots is really annoying to schedule around. Pretty cool they are only $2 though.

                              <span>Went to get a massage here in Hanoi. Massage was 300k and after the massage I assumed 50k would be enough for a tip. But the masseuse refused and so I pulled out a 100k note and she took it and then pointed at the 50k to give to her as well. I don&#x27;t speak any vietnamese so I just gave it to her as well. Was I ripped off? 50% tip is a little too much imo 😅 I just considered it foreigner tax and won&#x27;t be going back to that place lol
 Edit: This thread has been polarizing. And for the record it was just a normal 90 minute massage. No extras. And if I&#x27;m being honest the massage was not good either. The lady was inconsistent on where to apply pressure and did not do so equally on both sides and just massaged wherever. The place was nice and situated in a somewhat affluent neighborhood so I expected something better.

                              <span>We are very much looking forward to a 8 day trip to Da nang beginning of April. Can anyone please advise what you would budget for spending money, hotel and flights all paid for. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 young children. Any information and tips for places to go would be fab 😁

                              <span>Hi everyone! I just bought a set of cards that I had seen a group of Vietnamese women play a few days ago, and wanted to learn the rules but I can’t find anything convincing on internet (the rules found in Wikipedia don’t make much sense). Anyone has a link to the rules of Tam cúc (which is, I think, the game they were playing, as they had these thin Chinese cards)?
 Thanks a bunch! Will keep on looking online in case I find anything.
 Extra question: anyone knows where to import to Europe the cool plastic or wooden stools found at the street food stalls/bars?
 Edit: If someone knows the rules, could I send a DM with my doubts on the rules found online?

                              <span>I ask because I&#x27;ve seen quite a few articles about how extremely easily-offended many Vietnamese immigrant communities, especially in Seattle and throughout California and Texas, are when they see the modern flag, equating it with the Confederate and Nazi flags, and have forced many institutions to use the traditional yellow one instead.
 I kinda wonder if it&#x27;s as serious as local news outlets say it is or if it&#x27;s all gross exaggerations that inadvertently make the Vietnamese community look bad. Because taken to the logical extreme, it would mean Hardee&#x27;s/Carl&#x27;s Jr and Steven Universe would be protested against or banned.

 I&#x27;m trying to get a friend I know into modeling work in Vietnam but as a foreigner I know very little about the industry there. May I know a list of some well paying agencies in Vietnam so she could shoot her shot? Google isn&#x27;t helping very much here haha thanks.

                              <span>So basically, renting a bike and riding from HCMC to Hanoi later this year.
 Planning to rent either a Honda Blade or Honda XR150. The dates I will be travelling are from 24th Oct to the the 4th of November. 
 So I have currently planned 10 days of riding.
 Day 1: HCMC to Cat Tien Day 2: Cat Tien to Dalat Day 3: Dalat to Phan Thiet Day 4: Phan Thiet to Nha Trang Day 5: Nha Trang to Mang den Day 6: Mang Den to Hoi an Day 7: Hoi an to Hue Day 8: Hue to Phong Nha Day 9: Phong Nha to Mai chau Day 10: Mai Chau to Hanoi
 Now here is my dilemma. I am very time restricted and only have 12 full days to complete this ride. Is it possible to do this? Am I an idiot for even considering this? Will I make it in time considering weather etc? I am a very experienced rider, so riding in the rain does not bother me, but will floods and such stop me? Any recommendations or considerations would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, I hope you&#x27;re all doing well. 
 I am used to solo traveling, and sometimes I schedule solo trips for my birthday to celebrate it on a different way. Every time I did this I had an amazing time with the people I met randomly during the trips! 
 This year I&#x27;ve chosen to do this in Vietnam and I was thinking on spending this day on a 2-days cruise to Ha Long Bay. My other options are Hanoi itself or maybe Da Nang. I am, however, scared that these cruises are full of closed groups or families and I end up having a not-so-pleasant experience. 
 For those who did this already, what do you think? Is there any other alternative you strongly suggest? Side note: turning 33. 
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Tôi 24t. Đang đứng trước cơ hội học đại học ở nước ngoài. Nhìn bạn bè đã đi làm ổn định, xem lại mình thấy nản quá. Cũng vì ko lo học hành tử tế nên phải đi đường vòng. Xin tí động lực để tiếp tục đi các bro. Cũng khuyên các bạn nên học hành đàng hoàng để ko phải phí thời gian như tôi nhé 😢

                              <span>The highlight from my trip was the warm reception from almost everybody we met.
 The lowlight was the challenge to find good vegetarian food easily. Maybe it was first trip and so we were struggling to find the non-meat options but we did found some options online which I kind of became our thing for the rest of the trip.

                              <span>Tried withdrawing VND with transferwise card and hasn’t been successful. Tried over 5 ATMs and even my credit card but none are working. Anyone have a similar experience or alternative method? I can bank transfer people with my wise app but the fee is fairly high each time

                              <span>Someone recommended I bus from the Airport to D1. I ended up using grab which cost about 50k vnd, ~$2. Same as busfare but way faster and more convenient. Other than having to walk out of the airport perimeter before calling the grab.
 This made me wonder why buses should be used at all. Maybe just personal preference to be in bigger, safer vehicles? Why do you guys use them?

                              <span>Hey y’all! I’m currently visiting Vietnam from the US with my friend. I’m going to have some free time and l would like to try to meet some people and hang out. I don’t speak the language so that’s been tough so I know it’s a bit of a long shot lol. I am traveling with my friend who speaks the language but I’ll be having some down time to go out and explore a bit. I’ll be in Nha Trang, Da Nang, and Saigon. I enjoy live music, sight-seeing, coffee, bars, of course food! Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do and how i can meet locals? Or even other travelers? I’m not a super extroverted person so this is uncharted territories for me.

Mà quảng cáo phải theo sở thích người dùng chứ, trc giờ tôi có cá cược bao giờ đâu mà hiện lắm thế. Kết thúc là tôi đã xóa fb ra khỏi máy mình 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

                              <span>What’s the best and cheapest way to ship items (clothing, small souvenirs, etc) to the US from Vietnam? Don’t need the items in the US for a while so totally fine for it to take a month or more.

                              <span>I&#x27;m visiting Vietnam in April but having huge issues booking hotels via booking.com. Both of the hotels I have booked so far want me to either transfer them via Square/Paypal or give them my card details over Whatsapp.
 Does this seem like a scam? 
 They already have my card details, so I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t charge me the deposit immediately.

                              <span>We&#x27;re in Hanoi currently and didn&#x27;t plan ahead, so that&#x27;s on us. Ha long bay is something we&#x27;re planning to do, but the itineraries seem the same between companies and we came up with the idea of maybe just going to Ha Long and spending the night there to book a day cruise from town. 
 Is this a good or bad idea? We&#x27;re trying to budget and a lot the 2 day tours are higher than what we&#x27;re hoping for.

                              <span>I’m going to Vietnam for 2 weeks in May, I’m just looking for some ideas on how to fill my time being there. 
 My basic itinerary is the following
 Flying into Hanoi and going straight to Halong bay for 3 days Going back to Hanoi for 3 days Flying to Ho Chi Minh for 3 days Flying to Da Nang for 3 days 
 I’m going with my partner but she’s there for work for the first few days in Halong and we’re meeting in Hanoi 3 days later. 
 Just looking for some ideas on the solo 3 days in Halong for a somewhat adventurous guy, I plan on doing a day cruise and a Hike but don’t know how to fill the other couple days there. 
 I enjoy architecture and scenery I plan to enjoy in Hanoi, but any must sees would be amazing to hear. 
 The Ho Chi Minh trip I plan on doing the walking street and unsure how to fill the other days. 
 Da Nang I plan on doing the hands bridge and enjoying the beach I think doing the marble mountain as well and doing a trip to Hà Nội as well. 
 Any input, on how to fill the days is greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Just curious if anyone has recently had luck changing their vietjet booking? The website completely stops working when I try and confirm and see the price difference.
 Any recommendations? Should I call them? I have a flexible ticket!
 Thanks

                              <span>My friend (20) has lived in Latvia (Europe) for around 5 years now. He went to highschool here, speaks the language, goes to university and soon will be eligible for a citizenship here. To get it, he needs to renounce the Vietnamese citizenship but he told me that it can be a very long and difficult process. Does anyone have experience with it? Is it really that difficult?
 Another thing - he has not done the military training and is not planning to as he wants to spend his life in Latvia. But he has to go to Vietnam this summer to renew his ID. I&#x27;m worried he might get into trouble for avoiding the training so I&#x27;m quite worried about him going there. Can anyone give me some insight on this?

Of the people you know, what percentage wants to be a virgin until marriage? What is the role of religion in all of it? Do you think it is different than in the West?

Every single one of them, it reeks of a tourist trap. Does anyone here have experience with the area, are there any tours without these worthless tourist attractions? Have you negotiated with the boat drivers to take you somewhere else?

                              <span>Hey Everybody, I will spend 2 weeks in Vietnam (I live in Europe) and I already love that wonderful country.
 Of course 2 weeks are not enough to see all those beautiful spots/things, but I have a very detailed itinerary I prepared myself and I already know I will want to come back 😍
 The advice I would love to receive from you is what can I buy there that is way cheaper than in Europe. I am only thinking to buy stuff for myself, but it is not that clear to me if there are really all these opportunities like it seems reading online. 
 Appreciate any tips
 Thanks folks 😃🖐🏼

                              <span>I think, Vietnam could do several things to attract more foreign tourists, such as:
 Relaxing its visa policy and extending visa-free stay for eligible countries.
 Developing new products and services that cater to the diverse needs and preferences of travelers.
 Promoting its natural beauty, cultural heritage and gastronomy as unique selling points.
 Leveraging its strong economic ties with neighboring countries and potential markets.
 What is your thought?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some advice from vietnamese families/women or anyone who has done this before in a vietnamese context. 
 I&#x27;m the only expat in my community and I&#x27;d really love to start a mom&#x27;s group to get to know the others in the community better. I know the concept is probably not normal for Vietnam but would anyone have any suggestions on what sort of things would be a &quot;draw&quot; for a mom&#x27;s group? I know how the groups are in my home country but my husband says if I just say &quot;a time to share together, talk together, and learn from each other&quot; no one will come (I kind of agree). I also don&#x27;t want it to seem like a kid drop-off time if I say we will do things like have storytime and snacks. 
 What in your opinion would be some activities that would make a monthly group/meet-up for vietnamese moms exciting and worthwhile? 
 (For context, the group will be in vietnamese, and not in a large city setting) 
 Thanks!

 I am buying some gifts for my girlfriend&#x27;s family and one of the gifts (alcohol) has a snake symbol in it. I bought it but then I kept wondering if that may have some bad meaning in vietnam. If that&#x27;s the case, I will not give this gift. 
 Anyone? Thank you!

                              <span>Vlogs and reels deem Vietnam unsafe for travel.. crossing the street is a matter of life and death, people getting mugged here and there.. 
 People and long-time residents of Vietnam, I need to know your opinion! 
 I know these stuff should be take as a grain of salt, but what’s the real tea? 
 Tips and suggestions are also welcome! We will be traveling next week and will be staying around District 4 HCM, I’m ecstatic at the same time scared because of this awful reels.

                              <span>Hi! 
 Are there any shops in Hanoi selling old (used) comics, books and magazines?
 When i&#x27;m abroad i&#x27;m always looking for comic books in the native language, especially Donald Duck (Donald và bạn hữ) but also the franco-belgian stuff like Tintin, Lucky Luke and Asterix. It seems all this series were published in Vietnam at least two decades ago but not any longer. I guess Mangas are the big thing now.
 A couple of years ago (2017?) in HCMC i stumbled across a street (can&#x27;t remember which district) with shop on shop where old magazines were pieled up in front. I found a lot of stuff but it was just the first week of our trip and my wife would&#x27;ve killed me if we had to carry a ton of comics for a month...
 Are there any of these shops in Hanoi. I&#x27;ve been to Đinh Lễ Street and Nhà sách Mão already (these pop up when you google). But all i got was one new Tintin at Trang Tien bookstore. A lot of shops i found on Google Maps which seemed very promissing are actually closed (Covid i guess).
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! Im planning a trip from March 31 to April 11. I an wondering if it would be a good idea to split it in 2 between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. Would 5 days in each place be enough? Would you recommend to stay in one place, and if so, where? Thanks!

                              <span>I am travelling through Vietnam (in SE Asia 10 months right now) and some days ago I visited Ninh Binh area. I was so surprised how money demanding people are here. First time in my trip I saw people who punch tourits as they Gave too low tip... (Tam Coc lake). People here and also in Hanoi (sorry guys, thats my impression) are so impolite... I spent earlier 2 months in the south and in the central part and now I am so dissapointed.. white person means only money... more money... I am aware of that but even when I Got sick owner of our guesthouse wanted me to rent a bike and he was angry when I said &quot;Im sick, I stay in bed&quot; . I dont want to have so bad memories from this part of Vietnam - any tips where should I go instead typical tourist trail? I loved south and central one, north until now made a mess in my tourist head 😜

                              <span>Dear Redditors,
 We&#x27;re visiting Vietnam for the first time, and after seeing HCMC, Hanoi, Ha Long, and Da Nang/Hoi An we&#x27;re considering for location to work one week remotely before heading home - thus, where would you stay and why (at end of April)?
 My initial consideration is:
 a) to avoid HCMC and Hanoi and due to hecticness
 b) to avoid Nha Trang due to the potentially high amount of russian tourists/ex-pats
 c) to highly consider staying in Da Nang/Hoi An and renting a villa
 Thank you in advance for your opinions! Much appreciated!

                              <span>Not sure if this the right subreddit to consult. I am Eastern Orthodox Christian, but growing up my father and his side of the family were Catholic. I live near a Vietnamese Catholic church and I was always curious to observe a Catholic mass. Would I be judged for visiting a Vietnamese Catholic church on a random Sunday? As a Vietnamese person I notice that older Vietnamese individuals can be judgemental/gossip and as someone who usually wears head coverings to church out of respect and religious focus, I don&#x27;t want to stick out too much.

                              <span>Whenever I play any online games (especially Roblox, kid game, you know). I always see a group of Vietnamese plays together and trash-talking other players in their language. Their English is too bad that they even think the word trash-talking is swearing, and I were calling they are trash - I have no word. Kept trash talking about me because of the language barrier, I understand 100% what they said. However, they didn&#x27;t listen and always thought that I did something wrong to them, then spread the misunderstanding to their friends... Became really toxic, killed me in spawn because they have a gang,...
 If you are the member in that gang, please. Stop making the image of a friendly country turning into a toxic place where every one of my friends always warn me to stay away from them online (even Vietnamese friends advised me it)
 I also wonder if it is the majority of your community is like that, or I&#x27;m just unlucky?

                              <span>So apparently, Vietnam has signed an agreement to recognize driver&#x27;s licenses from other ASEAN countries. I&#x27;ve read from a a few sources that Vietnam does indeed recognize them in certain situations (but not others?). The sources don&#x27;t bother mentioning in which specific situations they&#x27;re recognized though. I&#x27;m planning to do the Ha Giang loop next week and heard they&#x27;re checking for checking for licenses quite frequently nowadays. Has anyone showed their Filipino, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian or Singaporean license to the cops and gotten away with it? (Or any other ASEAN country, just got lazy to list them all)

 Stefan Kubiak was a soldier who served in french foreign legion. He was sended to Vietnam to help keep french colonial rule. After he had seen french war crimes he defected to Việt Minh. He fought in battle of Dien Bien Phu. Due to recurring wounds and severe malaria, he fell seriously ill in 1963 and died in Hanoi.

                              <span>Just seeking out information regarding vietnamese language courses in Saigon. I&#x27;ll try to be succinct: I&#x27;ve looked online and on the forums but detailed info is scarce.
  
Are there comprehensive and or accredited language courses for English speakers?
 Are there long term courses with an aim to become at least high conversational or &quot;fluent&quot; in the sense of being able to clearly communicate at a decently high level?
 Are there any long term programs that facilitate long-term visas ( Education Visa/Student Visa) that are not higher learning degrees (bachelor&#x27;s ECT)?
 What are the approximate prices and costs for such programs? 
  
I&#x27;ve started doing preliminary information gathering and early stage planning for a possible timeframe of returning to HCMC between September to December of this…</span>

                              <span>Anyone has any recommendations? Ideally its combined skin care consultation with treatment services at a reasonable price. So far I have been going to Grace Skincare clinic in D1 which is pricey but good and high in demand. However, they do for example no fillers.

                              <span>Does anyone know where I can buy a ceramic water pot in HCMC? They look like this; they&#x27;re common in India and often have a spout for dispensing water. They keep the water cool and they&#x27;re prettier than keeping those ugly plastic jugs on the kitchen counter. Can&#x27;t find any shops or online stores that sell them though. Any ideas?

Yesterday, two friends of mine, and my own SIM card seemed to suddenly cut out and the data isn’t working and hasn’t worked today either. I don’t think I’ve managed to use 120gb, anyone have any idea? Any help is massively appreciated.

                              <span>Speaking as someone who loves baseball, I find it really cool that Vietnamese people are rocking my team’s brand (San Francisco Giants). Ofc it’s not as popular as the Yankees, Red Sox and D*dgers but I understand that MLB is more of a fashion brand and I’m sure most people who wear the brand probably don’t care about baseball at all but it just hits close to home seeing people rocking with it. Would be even better to get more people interested in the game.

                              <span>My wife is from Vietnam but has been living in the US for 8 years. Her parents have been living here longer, and no longer have any Vietnamese citizenship papers. The question concerns them.
 Due to circumstances they put their properties in the name of a relative who still lives in Vietnam, but now they wish to change that. Because they no longer have their citizenship papers, and it takes a long time to get them again, they cannot put the properties in their names. What sort of options do they have?
 I was wondering if there was a kind of trust they could use to own the property, but have the trust be controlled by them, or, at the very least, have it be controlled by a relative still in Vietnam, but with their name attached in some way that requires their consent for anything to be done to the property. They are old and probably too trusting, I want to see if there is any way we can help protect their interests as well as possible. They said they already spoke to an attorney, but I am not sure they spoke to the right kind or asked the right questions.
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Mostly curious about Hu Tieu and Bun Mam street food carts. The places that have reusable bowls, not the take out containers.
 I assume every customer just shares the same bowl and chopsticks if the owner cannot wash dishes.

 want to get married and get him here as soon as possible since I am already 25. I was looking into getting married right away and applying for the cr1 visa but I heard it takes such a long time and I&#x27;m looking to settle down and start a family soon.
 Should I meet him and then apply for the k1 visa??? I wonder if they would even let me apply since I barely meet him for the first time. I am just so confused about what I should do. I know I need to provide so many documents and proof. I&#x27;m in southern California if anyone knows any companies for assistance :(

                              <span>Xin chào mọi người. Mình hiện tại thì vừa tốt nghiệp đại học ngành kế toán và đang làm trong b4. Mình đang ở canada theo diện work permit nên sẽ có 3 năm để làm việc và cũng như cơ hội để kiếm thẻ xanh ở đây. Nhưng mà hiện tại thì em cảm thấy rất muốn về VN để sinh sống và làm việc cũng như được ở gần gia đình và bạn bè hơn. Nên mình dự tính là vẫn sẽ ở canada làm việc 2-3 năm để có thêm kinh nghiệm (và bằng CPA ). Mình chỉ đang thắc mắc là nếu trường hợp mình như vậy thì về vn có ổn không ạ? Và vấn đề lương thì mọi người thấy như thế nào? Mình thật sự rất cần lời khuyên ngay lúc này vì mình cảm thấy rất nhớ Việt Nam. Nếu quyết định về VN thì mình nghĩ lương sẽ không thể nào bằng được như ở CA được, nhưng mình nghĩ mình sẽ thoải mái hơn vì được gần gia đình và bạn bè và cũng như được ăn những món mình thích hoặc buồn thì cứ xách xe lên mà đi 1 vòng thôi. Nhưng nếu lương không ổn thì cũng hơi stress 1 tí. 
 Cho mình cảm ơn mọi người nhiều.
 Hi everyone. I have just graduated from the university majoring in accounting and currently working as an accountant in Big4. I am in Canada on a work permit so I will have 3 years to work as well as the opportunity to apply for a green card. But now, I really feel like going back to Vietnam to live and work so I can be closer to my family and friends. I’m planning to stay in Canada to work for 2-3 years to gain more experience (and getting CPA). Is ok to go back to Vietnam after that? And what about the salary expectation? I really need some advices right now because I miss Vietnam so much. If I do decide to return to Vietnam, I don&#x27;t think the salary will be as good as compared to CA, but I think I will be happier since I can be closer family and friends .
 Thank you and I really appreciate any advices/ suggestions/ inputs.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m currently in Southeast Asia and will be arriving in Vietnam in late April. I originally planned to do the motorbike loop in Ha Giang independently on rented bikes, but that was before I learned about needing a motorcycle license. I don&#x27;t want to risk my insurance being void, so that&#x27;s out of the question now. 
 I was pretty set on doing it independently without a company, so this threw a real wrench in my plan. I&#x27;ve already decided to skip travelling to Northern Thailand because of burning season, so I know I&#x27;ll be back to the area, so my question is whether I should wait until I have a motorcycle license and do it later in life, or just suck it up and do it with an easy rider. 
 The reason I&#x27;m posting is just to hear how it went for other people. I don&#x27;t love not being in control of my own bike, I&#x27;m somewhat introverted so the social aspect isn&#x27;t huge, I like being able to stop and check out little shops or side roads, and I&#x27;m concerned with a bigger group that I won&#x27;t be able to do this. I don&#x27;t really have the money to do a private tour, and even doing it with an easy rider is putting a bit of a stretch on my budget. 
 Overall though, I&#x27;m wondering if I should still just do it. I suppose I&#x27;m just looking for stories of how people felt using easy riders and whether they felt like they would have had a better time doing it solo. The loop was the one thing I wanted to do the most out of Southeast Asia, but I&#x27;m wondering if I should just do it later when I can fully enjoy it. 
 Thanks in advance!

 As a note: My friends love the zoo / safari which is why we were thinking of phu quoc

 I&#x27;m hoping to hire an artist who can create some sketches and Vietnamese writings in a journal that will be used as a prop in a short film.
 The project will require writing journal entries (in Vietnamese) for a character and producing sketches that would include medical drawings and sketches of plants, animals, and people. I would want to produce somewhere around 6-8 pages in total.
 Here&#x27;s the sort of look I am hoping for: Example journal
 Please send me a DM and we can talk about the project and your rate in more detail! Thank you!
 (Also, please let me know if I should post this request somewhere else instead.)

                              <span>Hello! Looking for some advice - let me know if this isn’t the right place. Friend and I are planning to ride 110cc bikes from north to south, weaving from mountains to coast in April/May. 
 We are fully licensed to ride motorcycles in the US and have been riding for years. Fully understand that riding there is different and we take that seriously. Would be wearing protective gear and staying off the roads that don’t allow bikes. The US IDP provided by AAA lists Vietnam as “not party to the 1949 convention but honors IDP”. This is a little confusing as Vietnam did sign the Geneva convention in 1953. So while we aren’t terribly worried about being allowed to do this, we are having trouble finding medical insurance coverage since there doesn’t appear to be any laws that explicitly say US citizens can rent or drive any type or vehicle there. We’ve read about certain companies that would provide medical coverage anyway as long as you are licensed and qualified in your home country but haven’t found one yet.
 Is anyone aware of a way we can do this? Or any companies that expats or travelers have used successfully recently? I’m not willing to ride without medical coverage so I would need to travel by other means or go somewhere else. This is a trip I’ve been thinking of doing for years - I’d be extremely bummed to have to see this beautiful country out a train window and not be able to experience the smaller mountain communities along the journey (I’d also need to do the trip alone in this case). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Spent 9 days traveling in Vietnam. Started from Hoi An and kept moving to Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, and ended at Ho Chi Minh. Used different modes of transport, met tons of people, and experienced things that I&#x27;m truly grateful for.
 My experiences helped me break a lot of stereotypes and prejudices that were told to me before my visit. Vietnam is not a country for cheap shopping or fake stuff or weird food. it&#x27;s not a country where people will con you or misguide you. It&#x27;s not a country that is rude, indifferent, or selfish.
 After 9 days in Vietnam, I&#x27;m taking back memories of meeting kind locals who go out of their way to help you, friendly shopkeepers who give you a small sovenieur as good luck because you made them smile while bargaining, helpful grab drivers who gave you a genuine smile just because you bowed and offered with money with both hands, Bar tenders and staff, who booked grab for me and offered a free drink just because i was nice to them. At every situation I got stuck or lost, I was given direction by locals who didn&#x27;t have to give a fuck about me. After traveling many places in the world, I sincerely believe that if tourists remove their stereotypical blindfolds, they can experience a truly beautiful country I.e. Vietnam. ❤️ And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m taking back to India with me.
 P.S: I would like to offer my hospitality if anyone is planning to travel to India, especially Mumbai. Over and out.

I have an International Driving Permit from USA through AAA, according to some sites I should be able to use my IDP to exchange for a Vietnamese DL. Is that possible or will they require me to have a TRC? This is for driving a car, not a motorbike.

 I am seeking for some tips and suggestions to explore the North part of the country in 2-3 weeks.
 Please share the places which I must cover/visit during this trip. 
 P.S. I love photography and so please suggest places which has potential for me to get some good memorable pictures.

                              <span>Hi guys, thank you for taking your time to view my post.
 I&#x27;m planning a trip to Vietnam for a month. During this trip I&#x27;m looking to fly to either hanoi or hcmc, buy a motorbike and travel to the other end of the country.
 I&#x27;m looking for stuff to stop off and do on the way, I&#x27;m an adventures person i like sky diving, scuba diving, para gliding, quad biking, and all that kind lf stuff. 
 I love beaches, exploring, beautiful views, good food and tradition.
 If you guys have visited this beautiful country before and have some suggestions it would be Highley appreciated 😊

 Long Back story: So I met this VN lady on a trip to VN, we expressed romantic interest in each other. I don&#x27;t know the VN language, written or oral, so we just used a translator.

                              <span>Xin Chao everyone! My question is straight forward - are universities good in VietNam? 
 I know that generally STEM is better than Social subjects, however if you guys would apply to a university in VietNam, which one would you consider? I would like to study Law or Business and I already know some basic Vietnamese as i had experience with the language before and studying it for university wouldn&#x27;t be a problem! 
 Please help me as I am considering VietNam as one of my destionations for pursuing a higher education, Xin Cam On! ;)

                              <span>I&#x27;m set to leave for Vietnam next week. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve just now found out that the internet speeds are supposedly garbage in Vietnam at the moment. How bad is it? Would a VPN help get around any throttling? Are phone network speeds similarly affected? I&#x27;m actually set to be taking online classes, so this is quite concerning for me.

 I just watched an amazing Korean drama on YouTube called Tranh Đoạt Thừa Kế (&quot;Graceful Family&quot; in English) with great Vietnamese dubbing. Does anyone have recommendations on other good shows with good Vietnamese dubbing?

 Where do you buy contact lenses and contact fluid? I&#x27;m in Bin Thanh at the moment but any place that speaks english will do. I don&#x27;t need a check up, just the lenses. I head out tomorrow and hoping to pick up lenses quickly. Looking for a place like Top Charoen Optical in Thailand. Thanks!

 ​
 I&#x27;m looking for a business suit for office use. I&#x27;m tall (1m85) so I will need to have it adjusted because the ready to wear offer in vietnam does not fit well for me (too short)
 ​
 Any suggestion ? For below 3 000 000 VND ?

 Thank You

                              <span>hello! so the topic for my high school thesis is &#x27;the history of vietnamese fashion&#x27; where i basically explain the development of the fashion of vientam throughout the history. i have one problem though. my sources are very limited because my vietnamese sucks (im very ashamed of it) and i struggle to translate the vietnamese sources. i have &#x27;Ngàn Năm Áo Mũ&#x27; at home but i barely understand anything. i found an english translation to one part which helped me hugely but now i need to translate the rest of the book. does anyone know if theres a translation to the whole book somewhere? or do you know any other sources regarding this topic?

                              <span>tl;dr: trying to find an old family graveyard. I know it’s hopeless, but maybe someone here has some advice lol
 My grandmother’s grandmother is from Huế, my grandmother’s family is from Tra Vinh, where we went to a family graveyard when we went to Vietnam for the first time this summer. We were able to come there since our family still has contact with Hmong people (?) that used to work for the family who own it now. It had the graves of many family members except one, my grandmother’s grandmother: Nguyễn Thị Điệm (born ca. 1880). Although there was a picture of her with her date of death: 20 Aug 1916. My grandmother told me that she was buried in Huế with her family, and that her brother who now lives in the US visited the grave in 2000 via contact with the gravekeepers, although she has not had contact with him for a long time, and does not seem very keen on doing it either. Apparently her brother (my greatuncle) is also not that bright due to his years in the camp.
 The family was apparently very rich, and were according to my family close to the emperor, I know nothing else except that Nguyễn Thị Điệm’s brother was a very prestigious or conceited photographer.
 I know its probably hopeless, but does anyone maybe have any advice on how i should find (how to contact) the graveyard (owners)? Or any other advice?
 Or just drop your personal family stories in the comments:)

I don’t really want book a trekking tour so I was just wondering if anyone has experience with this. Is it possible to trek to some different villages and book home stays for one night on arrival?
 Any other info is appreciated!

                              <span>I have a few opportunities in Vietnam but is trying to navigate the space here - in terms of relationship building and the softer side of people. 
 How does it work typically? I work for an MNC and while I do not want to go into the zone of corruption, I do want to understand the dynamics between seller/customers. 
 Do people typically go KTVs for some &#x27;fun&#x27; or is it usually in normal dinner places or what not? Are gifts expected?

                              <span>As the title says, it&#x27;s really hard to find someone in Vietnam since most of them have the same name and surname.
 So I&#x27;m actually a half Filipino half Vietnamese(dad filipino, mom vietnamese), when I was 7 years old, my mom was ask to go back to Vietnam since she&#x27;s been overstayed here in the Philippines, and promised to comeback after she fix the issue, and in the first few months we still have a communication with her and then suddenly gone, no calls, letter, etc.
 I am now 24 years old, Ive been searching for her for years, I do not wish her to come back to our lives, I just wanted to know how was she&#x27;s been doing. I tried searching her on facebook but no luck, cuz everytime I searched her full name a lot of the accounts has the same or similar names, I even include my middle name which is &quot;Nguyen&quot; in my facebook so its easier for her to find me.
 And I&#x27;m not even sure if this is right sub to post this, and sorry if my writing is scuffed, and also my english😅😅

                              <span>A long time ago I had a Vietnamese student who would say something anytime he would get a wrong answer or anytime he was frustrated. When I asked him about he said it was like a bad word. 
 It was a single word with a long s at the end.... Like &quot;hasssss&quot; or &quot;hesssss&quot;
 Would really like to know what the word actually was, hopefully he wasn&#x27;t calling me a dickhead! Haha

 For comparison Thailand, with 33% fewer local population, has about 3.5m expats

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be traveling for 4 months around South East Asia and am looking to buy medical insurance.
 All the providers I&#x27;ve seen (including reputable ones like TrueTraveller or World Nomads) say it on their fine print that they only cover medical treatment in state-run hospitals.
 I am looking for a provider that would foot the bill from a private hospital.
 Does anyone know of any providers?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I plan to travel to Da Nang via Ho Chi Minh City. The plane ticket that I am looking at has 1 hour 50 minutes layover in HCMC Airport. The airport&#x27;s domestic terminal doesn&#x27;t seem so far away from the international terminal. But being a foreigner, I need to go though the customs and immigrations, which I heard could take approximately an hour.
 Would I have enough time to catch the connecting flight to Da Nang or should I get another ticket that has a 3 hour layover?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am Vietnamese girl dating an expat for the 1st time, plz give me some advices. I live in Hanoi, he lives in HCM so this is the first time dating. He asks me to show him around when we meet in Hanoi. I was kinda passive in the relationships with other Vietnamese boyfriends before, like they picked me up to dating locations. Thus, I don’t know how to take the lead in dating with an expat in Hanoi. Which type of transportation used when we date? I don’t have car driving license. Pick him up by a motorbike I drive is bit weird, isn’t it? Have you been in this situation? Plz share your experience. Kindly introduce me some places that expats want to hangout in Hanoi. We are both in twenties. Much appreciated!
 Edit: Thank so much for your advice. Most of them are very helpful. I am way too overthinking. I was worried about the size difference if I drive him on a bike, im like 5’1 feet while he is 6’2 feet. But, I will ask him what he wants to choose bike or cab although bike is the my most preferred transport when hanging out in Hanoi. To whom who may wish me luck with green card: he is not even a Western. He is my Hindu colleague. We hit it off and accept a long distance relationship. That’s it. Now Vietnamese girls don’t date expats for money. We can be both cute and rich at the same time. Get used to it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am visiting Vietnam in July this year for a close friend&#x27;s wedding. Just wondering what Vietnamese people typically give their friends and loved ones as a wedding gift? I&#x27;ve actually never been to any wedding as an adult so I&#x27;m a bit lost and gifting in a completely different culture makes it feel even more daunting. I would love to hear some examples of what you would typically choose as a wedding gift.
 Also - Other foreign friends who are going have said they are just going to give the couple money, is this normal/acceptable in Vietnam? And if so, how much should one typically give?
 Appreciate any insights, cheers

                              <span>Hello! First time in Vietnam and enjoying the sights. Staying in Ho Chi Minh city amd curious if there are any good venues for live music, funk, or whiskey bar style settings. Recommendations welcome! Staying at the Au Lac Charmer hotel. 
 Also - what is the deal with the small bars that have multiple women out front? It’s not red light district, is it more to entice to enter the bars? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Me and girlfriend are currently in Saigon and we are obviously considering visiting the Cu Chi tunnels the day after tomorrow. However I&#x27;m not really sure whether it&#x27;s worth it or not, because of the relatively long drive there. 
 I&#x27;m very interested in the Vietnam war and already know plenty about it, so visiting something like this seem like a natural choice but at the same time I hate things that are too touristy and this seem exactly that. People posing for dumb pictures, like thousands of others before them, standing on destroyed tanks or in entrances to one of the tunnels.
 Would you recommend it?

                              <span>Hi, i am indian and i am just curious to know whether Vietnam has &quot;business/agents&quot; that offers views to Youtubers for money ? 
 Because i came across something on youtube that looks like targetting views/clicks from indians. The contents looks like from Vietnam hence i posted here. Sorry if this is not the right place for this.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am planning on traveling in Northern Vietnam this month. The air quality apps show really high PM 10 and PM 2.5 numbers, meaning the air is hazardous for health.
 I was wondering - is this casual for that side of the country or is it because of the burning season, similarly to Northern Thailand?
 Maybe anyone currently travelling there could share there experiences?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hey Community,
 I&#x27;m in Da Nang for the next 7 weeks and love it so far. But still did not meet any local women, which I obviously wouldn&#x27;t mind. I would like to go out tomorrow night, I don&#x27;t mind going solo. And then, I am usually not afraid to talk with a women if there seems to be an &#x27;&#x27;opening&#x27;&#x27;. I value a good friendship, and nice communication / talk, even if nothings happens afterwards. It&#x27;s really mostly about meeting local people/women and &#x27;&#x27;why not if more&#x27;&#x27;.
 What would be the best nightclubs to easily meet local people who are more likely to be &#x27;&#x27;into foreigners&#x27;&#x27; (I am in my thirties, very healthy and tall, I think I can be doing ok) and more likely to be able to talk a bit or good English ? Avoiding places full of &#x27;&#x27;pro&#x27;s&#x27;&#x27; and full of Koreans could be a good thing I imagine :D (but I imagine it&#x27;s not always avoidable).
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>So there&#x27;s this rap song that I came across, I &#x27;m just curious what it means since apparently it&#x27;s vulgar? Google translate made it kind of a jumbled mess. If I need to add a NSFW tag, please let me know. Here are the lyrics:
 Mình ở đâu đấy?
 Lạc vào trong xứ sở dâu tây
 Phía đằng xa,
 Giữa bãi cỏ hai người nằm ra
 Chú cuội ngủ cùng chị Hằng Nga
 Nick Vujicic dùng đầu đập cửa
 Gọi cô bé cầm nhầm bật lửa
 Bác xuân diệu vô cùng vội vàng
 Gọi cô tấm đi dự hội làng
 Bảy cô lùn đi cùng ông tuyết
 nếu bị lạc liên hệ tổng đài 1900-00-không-biết
 anh thánh gióng miệng nhiều vết bẩn
 ăn bánh quy, kẹo chip chip, sữa chua nếp cẩm
 aladin gạ gẫm mỵ nương bàn kế hoạch hóa
 sơn tinh ném bàn ghế gạch đá
 scooby dooby doo lại phải dắt sơn tinh đi tù
 giơ khẩu súng nặn bằng đất sét
 cả ngôi làng đều chạy mất dép
 scooby dooby doo lại phải dắt sơn tinh đi tù
 thủy tinh mang theo cốc trà chanh
 làng vắng tanh như chùa bà đanh
 ran mori sử dụng tán thủ
 các võ sư không ai dám thử
 nên nàng đưa conan về nhà cả hai phá án ở nhà thám tử
 một giấc mơ suýt thì hoàn chỉnh
 có giọng nói làm mình choàng tỉnh
 xanh, đỏ, tím, vàng 
 any help is appreciated, sorry for possibly sounding stupid.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 We are going to Vietnam for 2 weeks late March with my wife (28 and 25 year old): 5 days in HCM, 3days in Phu Quoc and 5days in Hanoï.
 ​
 In Hanoï we are thinking going there:
  
Hanoi Train Streets
 Ha Long Bay : do you recommend 2days/1night or 3days/2nights?
 Vietnam Military History Museum
 Hoàn Kiếm Lake
 Don Xuan market
 French quarter
  
​
 HCM:
  
Ben Thanh market
 An Dong market
 War remnants Museum
 Vincom Center
 Nam Cat Tien park
 Nguyen Hue walk
 Mekong Delta
  
​
 Do you have any recommendations or advices? 
 Also, I am a bit clueless on the best transportation to go to Ha Long Bay or Mekong Delta. In the city, I planned to use Grab or Go-jek.
 ​
 Thanks in advance :)

 Since I&#x27;ll be visiting several factories in the region, traveling by cars, would it be considered inappropriate or disrespectful if I wear shorts? 
 Any suggestions are welcome!! Thank you in advance!!

                              <span>I’ll be in Vietnam for a month soon with another month in Thailand before i return to Vietnam for another few weeks. I live in Europe and I’m not sure how mobile networks work outside European Union. I’m looking for a good few GBs of data 20-30GB allowance with a few national calls for hostels and local calls. Do Vietnamese providers offer roaming in neighbouring countries like you’d get in Europe? What are the prices like and what are my options? All help appreciated.
 I actually work for a big provider in my home country where it’s unlimited national data + 19GB anywhere in the EU for €20 . I’d love to find something similar if possible.

                              <span>I am not from there, but curious if it makes sense as a retirement plan for us. Cheaper cost of living? Visa issues? Recommandations on what parts of the country would make sense? Buying home? Medical issues? I&#x27;ve been there many times but considering long term life as a retired person. Anyone here do it?

                              <span>Two years ago I was constantly seeing stories about how Vietnam had the highest economic growth in Southeast Asia. Was getting massively invested in by Japan and Korea, and had tons of companies relocating to it from China during the Sino-American trade war. Many YouTubers I was watch on the ground said they could see the explosive growth year by year as it felt like the early days of China as it was beginning to achieve great economic success. The everyday life was becoming tangibly better year by year.
 But I checked in again recently, and I saw the GDP growth has massively faltered the past two years, and also saw that the previous economics minded president has seemingly been replaced by a more politics minded one.
 So I was just wondering, does Vietnam still seem to be on track for explosive growth and this is just a short break because of COVID or is the growth really slowing down? Is life still improving year by year in Vietnam to a noticable degree?

                              <span>Hi, I am on Phu Quoc right now and I see it again. Huuuuge luxury hotels, but nearly completely empty. When I look the price up its 5M Dong a night. 5M Dong. 
 How do these luxury hotels even survive? Why they don’t lower the price?
 It seems like the hotel owners are so crazy rich they don’t care about some losses and don’t want to lower the prices to not lose image or something. (imagine you pay $200 for a hotel and some months later it’s $100 a night because of low demand. in Europe or also in Thailand, hotels dgaf and just lower the price to get at least some customers, but here it’s not like that). Or?? I can’t understand it pls explain me guys
 Also this Vin Grand World has sooo many restaurants and stuff with expensive food, but most of them are completely empty because it’s too expensive when you could get outside the same food for much lower price. 
 It seems like the “market” with demand offer etc doesn’t really work for these giants they just dgaf about losses, or is there some bigger story behind that? I also remember how people in this sub once talked how expensive vinfast cars became or smth like that

                              <span>Sorry if this has been asked before. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if a large number of people in Vietnam want to immigrate to other countries(specifically the West) or if this is government propaganda in the West trying to put down other countries to make themselves look better by comparison. 
 Thanks for your help in advance!

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Have you stayed in a hotel in the Old Quarter recently?
 I visited Hanoi in 2018, 2019 and again in 2022. The hotels had changed a lot in 3 years as many had been affected by Covid and the flood damage. While no doubt it&#x27;s down to the unfortunate circumstances, the last couple of places I stayed in 2022 were nothing like the photos/reviews, were damaged and run down.
 Bringing the family along in 2023 and would like to know your recommendations for a nice place to stay.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I visited Hanoi for a few weeks and went to some clubs too. In most clubs the sold balloons and I was told they contain laughing gas. Saw some people getting really high on it and kinda knocked out sometimes.
 Friend handed me (already very drunk) one and I tried it several times excessively but had no reaction.
 First, I don&#x27;t know if laughing gas is illegal. Some clubs were really suspicious and you had to talk to some guy around a corner to get through some secret gate. Somehow you couldn&#x27;t here any of the loud music outside.
 And second could we get scammed? Is selling fake gas a thing? I&#x27;m not a fan and won&#x27;t do it ever again, but I&#x27;m really interested in understanding what happened there.

                              <span>Hi Everyone, Yeah it&#x27;s another Vietnam itinerary.
 I&#x27;m traveling with my wife from India to spend around 2 weeks in this country on our anniversary. Need help in making an itinerary that has a balance of both a little fast and relaxed overall.
 But I&#x27;m too confused to jot down the itinerary completely, mainly in the number of days to spend in a city. Some parts are fixed though.
 Fixed (15 days): 14th April &#x27;23 to 28th April &#x27;23,
 Flights Booked and stay booked for Phu Quoc
 14th arrival (Ho Chi Minh) Going to Phu Quoc directly
 14th to 16th (Phu Quoc)
 28th departure (Hanoi)
 I want to cover the country from south to central to the north, with the 19th being preferred not traveling as it&#x27;s our anniversary that day.
 Uncertain (16th to 28th):
 No Stay or Travel option booked
 16th to 18th: Ho Chi Minh Stay
 18th to 19th: Nha Trang, can this be skipped? as it&#x27;ll make us travel on the 19th to Hoi An/Da nang
 19th to 21st: Hoi An, Da nang, and Ba Na Hills (Unable to select dates to stay where on which date, maximizing things to do in each place)
 22nd to 28th: Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Sa pa
 We want to cover Ninh Binh and Phong Nha National Park as well but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible as this above draft itself feels a little rushed. We are already removed Dalat and Hue from our itinerary for the same reason, doesn&#x27;t want it to be too fast-paced.
 Now I want help with what place we can omit if this itinerary looks too rushed or not possible.
 Any other suggestion for a newbie in Vietnam please do suggest!

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 Has anyone ever heard of a store in Saigon called Kallos? It’s located in D10 and they have items I want to get for myself and others, however I cannot find anyone (so far) who has either heard of them or shopped there. 
 They’re an outlet (similar to Vincom) and have excellent professional reviews and items, nice FB page, reviews and it’s run by a Korean man who opened up his own shop. But it would be very reassuring to know if someone has actually shopped here before. 
 If either anyone here, or you have someone who has shopped here before, please let me know and the most important let me know if the products you bought were authentic or fake because this is what I’m worried about more than anything. I attach an image of the address and business as well. Kallos Vietnam

Now while I saw him grab them out of the Zepam 10 packet they are obviously sealed still. They don’t have the MS engraved in them just a cross on one side most of the pictures online look to have an MS as well. What do we think?

 Anh cùng đang cô gắng tự học Tiếng Việt rồi nếu mọi người ơi thể recommend những có gì anh có thể bài tạp. I would be quite grateful.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a driver&#x27;s license in Germany for cars only and I have a Vietnamese passport but my residence is in Germany.
 I would like to bring an international Driver&#x27;s license back to Vietnam to ride a motorbike legally. I know I just need to do a practical test.
 My question is: will my licence have a short expiry date like foreigners who stay in Vietnam for a limited time? Or will the license expiration date be the same as my driver&#x27;s licence in Germany because I have Vietnamese citizenship? I have no residence in Vietnam.
 My plan is to use the license again for multiple visits. It will take time for the license to be issued, so I can&#x27;t afford the time to get the license every time I visit Vietnam.
 (Yes, I know I can drive illegally and bribe officers, but I want my health and liability insurance to pay for higher damages if I ever get into a serious accident)

 Tôi sẽ đánh giá cao nếu bạn có thể hiểu rằng dư luận Hàn Quốc phần lớn cũng đang chỉ trích Bộ trưởng. Dù vậy chính phủ hiện nay đang bị chỉ trích rất nhiều nhưng không ngờ Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng lại làm như vậy... Go Vietnam
 As a Korean, I feel embarrassed about this incident. I regret the terrible things that happened during the Vietnam War.
 I would appreciate it if you could understand that Korean public opinion is largely criticizing the Minister as well. Although the current government is being criticized a lot, it is unexpected that the Defense Minister would do such a thing... Go Vietnam

                              <span>I dropped my phone resulting in my screen breaking. This phone is a Huawei p30. I will be in Vietnam for another two weeks and then onto Cambodia so need a solution. 
 Does anyone know if this can be cheaply fixed in Vietnam. I am aware lcd screens can be costly. We are going to Nha Trang next, then Ho Ch Minh and Phu Quoc.
 Should I just buy a new/second hand phone? If so, any recommendations where I could buy one from. Thanks!

                              <span>I’ll be spending two weeks across Vietnam in March and would like to visit places where I can learn about the history of your country. I understand that there are plenty of museums in Hanoi and Saigon, but I’m curious to hear about other historically significant locations that can be visited and learned from as a tourist. 
 Large graves, temples, war zones, etc.. are of interest, if possible.

                              <span>I lived in Hanoi from 2005 to 2007 (Vietnamese second gen, went back with my parents so I could learn the language and culture) and then visited during the summers until around 2010. I really want to go back at some point and I’m curious as to how much Hanoi has changed. Some things I remember:
 Roads were like 90% motorcycles, 7% cars, and 3% bikes
 Sông tô lịch was literally just an open sewer (please tell me this has gotten better lmao)
 No one wore seatbelts, and while I was there when people began being required to wear helmets, a lot of people wouldn’t buckle them
 Cutting in line was very common 
 Crosswalks weren’t a thing, you just walked across the street and people swerved around you
 Has any of this changed?

                              <span>Hey Everyone, 
 I am in the process of getting teacher work visa in Vietnam but my employer asked me to &quot;legalise&quot; a bunch of documents like my passport, diploma, ect. I&#x27;ve never heard this term and struggling to find out how to do it. Can anyone help me or share experiences?

I have old one&#x27;s that I have brought back from Vietnam but they are deteriorating so I wanted to get new ones. The only way I could find to get them is from shopee but I can&#x27;t find a reliable Vietnamese agent to send those over here.

 I know there&#x27;s that one viral Vietnamese song on TikTok, but it&#x27;s a bit too cutesy and sugary to really be a &quot;theme song&quot;. I also don&#x27;t know, or think, that there&#x27;s quite an equivalent to Gangnam Style for South Korea, but if I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;d like to hear it.

 First post here because I am panicking. I am travelling to Vietnam TOMORROW. I have no travel/health insurance. Some websites still list it as a requirement. Is it actually ?!! It is not written on my country’s embassy’s website. 
 Please help clarify this for me. I am so stressed and scared that I can’t travel .

 Era was recommended by my hotel but I had low expectations. I&#x27;m happy to say that the food and service were magnificent. 
 Duan and his wife are foodies and it shows in the taste and presentation of the good eats they serve at their restaurant. After a short chat I learned that Duan is self-taught cook and that he and his wife love to experiment with recipes. His methodology puts me in mind of a food scientist. 
 I left very full. Very happy. And, very satisfied. I finally had a meal that was worth all the hype.

                              <span>Thao and the staff on the boat for the Halong Bay Tour were phenomenal. 
 I was on a tour with another company when I realized the return time to Halong Bay City would make me late for a transfer to Hanoi. I was assured at booking that there would not be a conflict but that was not the case. 
 I saw Thao&#x27;s boat departing (a completely different company) and asked if I could hitch a ride back to the city with them. Both the captain and Thao, the tour guide, agreed to let me come along. 
 But, it gets better. Thao called my hotel so I could grant permission for the transfer driver to pick-up my luggage. 
 He also called the transport company to arrange an alternate pick-up location and changed my pick up time. Then Thao had one of his wait staff to rush me to the new pick-up location on the back of her scooter. Thanks to them I made it to Hanoi and now sit comfortably in my hotel room. 
 Thao refused a tip and I paid a nominal fee to the captain and the waitress/motorbike driver. In fact, the waitress returned half of the very small fee I paid her and refused when I insisted she keep all of it. 
 I&#x27;m so grateful to Thao and the staff for helping a complete stranger. They truly went above and beyond earning them the LifeSaver award. Many thanks to them all.

                              <span>I took a TripAdvisor contributor&#x27;s tip and picked the cheapest tour for the Halong Bay Half Day Tour because everyone goes to the same places. 
 This was my experience. Punctual transport from my hotel to the pier. 
 Great communication via Airbnb although start times displayed on the site when booking are incorrect. I confirmed that if I took the 11:30am tour that I would be back in time for 5:30pm pick up for my private transfer to Hanoi. I was assured that I would not miss pick-up. 
 My group was escorted by a coordinator inside and instructed to sit down where we were abandoned for approximately 40 minutes. One couple left because we did not know who we were waiting for, if anyone would return, or where we were going. 
 The coordinator returns, hands out tickets and then led us to the …</span>

                              <span>I love living in Vietnam 🇻🇳 ❤️ but the thing that kills me is the unnecessarily LOUD TRUCK HORNS. My ears hurt and it startles me (sometimes to the point of crashing) every time one of them decides to blare their cargo ship horn near me. I get alerts on my Apple Watch all the time about how the noise level could cause hearing loss. Oh and the way they drive is insane too! This happens all the time: a big ol 🚛 barreling down the road in the lane traveling the opposite direction from me ENTERS INTO MY LANE, and almost literally RUNS ME OFF THE ROAD. Keep in mind, as a guy driving a motorbike, I’m already in the habit of riding on the very edge of the road, but in the interest of safety, I’ve had to go off the road so many times because some impatient cargo truck driver can’t stand to behind another car so they invade a lane of oncoming traffic whenever they feel like it.
 Back to the horn problem…it has caused numerous deaths. It’s so loud that it had caused people to be startled to the point of falling off their motorbike and getting hit by the semi trucks or getting into deadly accidents with other vehicles from loss of control. It happens too much, and although there is technically a law against it but the penalty (like 2-3tr vnđ) is so light compared to the damage it causes.

                              <span>Hi all, I’m a Vietnamese American who does dragon boat over in the US. I was curious about teams over in Vietnam since I haven’t really seen any Vietnamese appearances at international competitions online. If anyone could point me to the existence of a national team or just any team in Vietnam so that I can keep up on social media, that’d be much appreciated!

                              <span>I have a package from Hong Kong. They are upgraded parts for a small machine.
 I bought them from a store in China, it costs about 365 dollars. The store decided to deliver my package by Fedex (Air way).
 It was shipped quickly from HongKong to Ho Chi Minh for about 3 days, but then it got stuck at a clearance process for over a week. Now I have no clue what I need to do next since Fedex Vietnam keeps asking me to wait.
 For those having the same experiences, is that your typical durations for an import custom process to Vietnam? This is a first time I buy a product from foreign countries so I am little shock.
