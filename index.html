                              <span>Hello all
 ​
 I am currently planning my trip to Vietnam. I come from UK. 
 I would love to stay in an ensuite room somewhere in Vietnam as I like the flexibility of not having a long term contract and not sure an agency will rent to me for a short term of like 3 months.
 ​
 I want to as, do hotels offer rooms for discounted price if I rent a whole month?
 I am looking for private room with its own bathroom + wifi etc, and would like to pay around 200GBP a month. IS this possible? 
 ​
 I am new to traveling. Could someone elaborate on this please?

 I travel frequently so a hectic itinerary is not an issue. I want to make the most out of our trip. You might have an itinerary you can share to get my planning started. I’m traveling in the first week of May.
 If you have food itinerary that you can share, that would be great! :) want to try a lot of Vietnamese food/cuisines and or course, coffee.
 thank you!

                              <span>Is the animal associated with people who are constantly scheming behind your back? In other words, would anyone get it if I described a person as a vile snake, or rather it would sound weird?
 There&#x27;s a dedicated Chinese zodiac sign to these creatures, so if anything, I assume they are instead associated with some set of universal virtues and flaws. On the other hand, biblical symbolism of snake should not make an outlandish concept for Vietnamese people, as the French left a significant impact on the culture.
 So what&#x27;s the meaning behind a snake one could think of in the first place?

 Four exchange students living in South Australia have disappeared in the past months, leaving police and their host families baffled.
 The teenagers disappeared at different times in December and January and Daily Mail Australia understands police are treating each case as separate incidents. 
 In the latest case, Sunnie Nguyen, 17, was last seen at her host family&#x27;s home in South Plympton on Monday, and now her phone has been disconnected and her social media accounts wiped.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Can I use Tai for either boy or girl? Are there any bad associations with Tai, any criminals or mass murderers? Any other unforeseen risks with a name like Tai? Thank you!

                              <span>I would of course like to try all the local food there but would also not like to get food sickness from it. How does one decide which place is safe to eat and not? Are most street food generally safe?
 Also, what are some must try restaurants or foods in Saigon, Hanoi and Da Naang?

                              <span>It&#x27;s not my first time in Asia, and it&#x27;s not my first time in Vietnam either.
 However, today marked the day when I let my guard down and someone took direct advantage of it.
 After an exhausting day of traveling through multiple airports and planes, my partner and I arrived in HCMC this evening.
 Exhausted, tired, and hungry, we desired minimal conversation, so we headed straight to the cabs at the airport and boarded the first cab available. In retrospect, it was a significant mistake—one we wouldn&#x27;t typically make. Perhaps we had grown too complacent due to consistently positive experiences over the last few years, ignoring several red flags that should have set off alarm bells.
 The cab was an unremarkable SUV with a small blue sign and a very modest blue logo on the side, not Vinasun …</span>

                              <span>Noticed this sight earlier this week. This small unassuming Banh Mi Stand next to the Cathedral, Banh My Mama, continuesly had a long line of (i assume) foreigners waiting 20+ minutes for a single Banh Mi. Baffling, because the neighbourhood is riddled with similar Banh Mi stands. Is this a particularly good Banh Mi spot, or is it just mentioned in some blog or travel guide?

                              <span>Hi there. 
 Me and my friend are currently on a backpacking trip around SE Asia. We were planning on starting our Vietnam portion of the trip around the 8th-10th of February, entering from Cambodia into HCMC. We’ve recently been informed that Tet celebrations are during this period. I am personally blaming the fact that we have done the least amount of research on Vietnam as it is the last destination of our trip as to why this was new information to us.
 We have since done a bit of research and have seen conflicting opinions on how much will actually be open/ what we will be able to do in HCMC during this period and was wondering if anyone here would be able to enlighten us. While we think the idea of getting to see the celebrations would be a really cool opportunity, we also don’t want to be stuck in our hostel for days and struggling to find food to eat etc. If this was the case we may extend our Cambodia section of the trip and travel to HCMC at a later date. 
 Thanks very much

 I think it would be much easier for them to connect to customers in need of their service. There&#x27;s no need to call and asking people walking by if they want a taxi or not, and the app would automatically connect the drivers to someone who needs them. There&#x27;s no need, and you don&#x27;t have to idle around under the sun&#x27;s burning heat in hope of being able to &quot;fish&quot; someone
 For all the reasons I mentioned, I don&#x27;t quite comprehense why drivers don&#x27;t just all stop doing the old-school way and choose the digital road.
 I get it that not everyone can afford a smart phone, but the budget line of samsung for example is 1 mil, and usable enough to run Grab. I also get that most old-school, traditional drivers are older folks, who might not know how to use a smart phone. But it&#x27;s a thing that can be easily taught and learned, just how to use that one specific app, when to click this and that, not the whole phone system
 I know I might sound dumb and entitled, but I have no bad intentions and really want to know why.

                              <span>Just took a trip to Vietnam to see family for 3 months and it made me so happy to be free from the Western society rat race I was in. I connected with my family on a deeper level, and I felt a large sense of comfort that didn’t get living in a Western country all my life. I seriously want to move here. I have $300k saved up and income from online businesses coming in. My fellow Viet Kieus why did you move to Vietnam? What made you leave your country? And what did you do to make that move permanently?

                              <span>Have you found that Tết is used as an excuse for a variety of professional or personal shortcomings? 
 From not making payments on time, canceling services unannounced, morning drunkenness and spending too much on frivolous items, it seems saying &quot;It&#x27;s Tết&quot; (or &quot;its almost Tết&quot; or even &quot;It was just Tết&quot;) excuses a great variety of behavior that wouldn&#x27;t be tolerated other times of the year. 
 Have you found this to be true? 
 Do you have any good examples of this happening?

                              <span>So, finally, I made it to Ha Noi. The trip was supposedly last year.
 Anyway, I noticed there are no homeless people in the streets of Ha Noi. There were no beggars, either.
 Is it the same all over Viet Nam? If yes, does it mean there are no illegal settlers or dirt poor in Viet Nam? Is this some kind of government policy?
 Or, is it just Ha Noi, being a city? Is it just the weather?

                              <span>Hey folks! I will be traveling to Vietnam next month an I am incredible excited to visit for my first time! I just wanted to ask and see if bringing Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) into Vietnam is ok? According to my research, I noticed that the medication is illegal but previous reddit threads have said that nobody really cares if you bring it in, and it is fine if you use it only for yourself with medical usage while there short-term.
 If I did bring the Sudafed with me into Vietnam, is there any chance that they would be checking for that while I enter the country at my arriving airport? If I did bring the medication with me into Vietnam, what are the odds of me getting caught, and what would be the potential ramifications? I am just trying to judge the risks, I know I may be sounding a bit too paranoid.
 What would you all recommend? Would it be ok to bring into the country with me or should I leave the Sudafed at home? (My demographics are 21 M, USA in case if that matters)
 Thanks everyone, and I look forward to reading your responses! :)

                              <span>Hello everyone, I plan to go on vacation to Vietnam this year. I would like to rent a car there. I am aware that the traffic in Vietnam can be quite chaotic and it is often advised not to drive a car.
 I have read that I should convert my international driving license into a Vietnamese driving license there.
 When searching for rental cars on the Internet, I have not yet found any rental companies.
 Can I rent a car in Vietnam as a foreigner? If so, how and where?

                              <span>Sorry to bother you all, I can’t find much info online and I haven’t found a post about it here so I thought I would check in. 
 So I have an ear infection but I don’t particularly want to go to a doctor if I don’t have to when it comes to getting my hand on medication. Do any of you have any recommendations on over the counter medicine or eat drops that you find work? Or do you think I should just go to a doctor to be sure?
 Appreciate the help and sorry if this is a silly question! 🫶

                              <span>It&#x27;s the second time it happens in da nang. They stop me while I&#x27;m walking and show me photos of very beautiful girls(seems fake) on their phone and tell me for 40 euros you can have sex with them in a hotel. I&#x27;m not interested in hookers so I tell them no thanks, but they can get quite pushy with this. Is it some kind of scam? And if this is true that they take you to a hotel to have sex with some girls, are they victims of human trafficking or something like that?

                              <span>Hello there ! Is there anybody willing to help me and try to find my stolen iPhone? It was stolen last week in Phnom Penh Cambodia. And as I can still track it down in &quot;find my&quot; I can see it went for a trip to Vietnam, currently in Ho Chi Minh City. The location is now updated quite often and not moving so I suppose it could be offered in one of the &quot;official&quot; shops around this adress:
 15 Alley 78 Hàn Hải Nguyên, Phường 8, Quận 11, Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam
 If anybody has the guts and willing to check it there and help me in this iPhone hunt I will offer a reward for sending it back to me.
 It is in lost mode and erased, so should not be operable without my ID. if still lost mode screen is on, contact number should be &quot;00&quot;.
 DESCRIPTION: iPhone 14 Pro, 256 GB, gold, Model A2890, Serial No. ending _ _ _ _ _ _K67H.
 Let me know !

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to buy an apartment soon to settle down for the long term. I&#x27;ve always wanted a park/greenaries but also a lot of conveniences and 24hr stores. The Vinhomes Central Park area offers just that.
 That said, I&#x27;ve read complaints about Vingroup, as well as Vinhomes. Specifically reviews are saying the house loses it quality after a few years with cracks on the wall and water damping, a bunch of issues that aren&#x27;t easy/cheap to fix as an individual.
 Anyone who has stayed there for awhile can shed some light for me on the apartment quality itself? My main concerns are is the infrastructure (stuff that are behind the wall that I cannot see or buy something on Shopee to replace) and how much maintenance effort it is going to take me years down the line.
 Thanks all.

                              <span>When driving around Saigon, I see lots of clothes that people wear with broken English, sometimes it makes sense with some spelling mistakes, other times it is complete and utter nonsense. 
 Where can I buy some? I assume markets but I&#x27;ve never seen any for sale in the wild? 
 For any tastefully tasteless pieces I&#x27;ll be very grateful. 
 As a side question, do people wear these things knowing that the English makes no sense? Is it part of the fashion, I could see it as part of the VNese sense of humour

                              <span>Hello all. Its my second time in Vietnam and I&#x27;m having a meal in front of the central mosque in District 1. When this guy came over and and start brushing my white crocs with a toothbrush. I guess this is popular in other countries too but I figured hey why not since my crocs are dirty from all the walking. Fast forward he completed the job . Before that I ask him how much is it and he said whatever I feel like giving him. So I gave him 50 but I ask my wife who is a Vietnamese to pass it to him. He asked for a 100 for a meal. I&#x27;m like wow. Even the grab driver who brought us from district 7 through the jam is not earning that much. My wife of course refused and give him 50 after a heated discussion. He&#x27;s even willing to hustle a Vietnamese. I mean I&#x27;m just sharing here it&#x27;s not really a scam but yeah. Haha.

                              <span>Hi guys, really enjoy vietnam and the culture that it brings so far. Even started to learn a bit of Vietnamese language for interest’s sake. 
 I will like to be more exposed and ask if there is any interesting habits/lifestyle that vietnam locals do that foreigners may not be too observant to notice! 
 E.g. - In Singapore, it’s very normal for us to mix languages in a daily conversion with our peers (English, Mandarin, Malay, Hokkien, Cantonese) - We also reserve seats in eatery places using tissue packets to show that the seat is taken

                              <span>I’ve been planning on booking a group tour with Intrepid that starts on Feb 15th - early March and travels from HCMC to Hanoi. Will this trip be affected by the Tet celebrations? I was hoping to arrive into HCMC by the 14th of Feb. 
 I was also planning to do Northern Vietnam at the start of March (Sapa and Ha Giang loop) but I’m worried about the burning season. I’m not a city person and am more so into nature/outdoorsy activities 
 I had to save up for this trip so I want to get my moneys worth. Should I avoid travelling during this period?

                              <span>My partners family treats us as if we’re engaged. They discuss when we’re buying a house and see us as family. In my country, living together is just seen as 2 people who want to pursue a long term relationship but want to test the water. What is the significance of living together in VN culture?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m here to seek your wisdom and perspectives on a financial situation that&#x27;s quite unique, and I hope to find others who may have experienced something similar in Vietnam.
 In early 2022, I made a pivotal decision: I left my regular job as I was feeling burnt out and stuck at a job which I didn&#x27;t like and started an online business. Given the lower cost of living in Vietnam, I was over the moon with an income of $1,000 to $2,000 per month living the good life, with my monthly expenses being around $500. Importantly, my lifestyle did not change at all during this time, even when my circumstances did.
 However, my financial situation took an unexpected leap. My business suddenly started ramping up like crazy within a few months peaking at around $20,000 per month, a figure …</span>

 Honestly looks good, only issue now is the process was very damaging to my scalp. It was my first time dyeing my hair so I didn’t know if I should’ve asked to not dye the roots because I didn’t know how painful it would be to my scalp. 
 Now my scalp is pretty red, irritated, and I expect for it to scab up in the upcoming weeks. Researched a bit on Reddit and found I have chemical burns, which the opinion on Reddit seems to range from “contact a lawyer!” to, “use aloe vera and similar products and you’ll be fine in a couple weeks.” I have no idea what I can and can’t do as an American tourist here.

                              <span>Hello All,
 I am trying to finalize my Viet name trip in April. I need some help to make my final decision on our itinerary. 
 Land in Saigon on 4/3/24 and staying at the Intercontinental. Is this a good hotel to stay within vicinity of walking to food and bars? Is there any other hotel recommendations?
 Flying to Da Nang on 4/6/2024. Should we stay in Da Nang for the weekend or stay in Hoi An? We have decided to just Stay in Hoi An for 1 night only and the rest of the days in Da Nang as there may be more things to do. Recommendations?
 Flying to Phu Quoc on 4/12/24 - 4/16/25 for our anniversary. We will be relaxing in this city. Staying at the Intercontinental. 
 Flying to Saigon on 4/16/24 for a couple nights before we fly home on 4/18/24.
 Thank you to everyone&#x27;s help!

 Is it an error on our part? Were we scammed? Is there a way to fix this without going back to the airport?

                              <span>Hello all. I’m considering moving to Vietnam to teach English. I’m in touch with an agency which told me that my passport is a problem (I have a Pakistani passport) , they recommend that I go there and start working on a tourist visa and do visa runs every 3 months. Which would give the employer the time to see my capabilities and they’ll probably pull some strings to give me a work permit eventually, maybe. 
 It sounds risky to me right now but they claim that the teachers don’t have to face any consequences in case something goes wrong. (what my anxiety heard : something CAN go wrong)
 A part of me tells me this is not a good idea, and that if I’m working abroad, everything should be legal so I’m not constantly under stress. Another part of me wants to just go for it? Believe in myself and take the risk. (this part of me doesn’t care that I’m broke rn)
 I’m also wondering if there’s a chance for me to get employed at an agency or something? I have a bachelors in Fine Arts and a masters diploma in Photography. I’ve been working as a freelance photographer. I also know social media content creation, video editing, graphic design, art direction and most things creative. 
 I’d appreciate any kind of information/advice. Thanks.

                              <span>I work for a Youtube CMS/ Multi Channel Network company based in Germany. Recently we have been contacted by five Vietnamese content companies who want to work with us. They want to open channels in our network to distribute their content. We are a little confused as to why 5 companies specifically from Vietnam are contacting us.
 We have asked them how they found us or why they want to work with us and they said they want to diversify their operations and that they found us through search. 
 Our theories are: SEO, changes in legislation/they want to avoid some taxes, possible scam?
 I need help from Vietnamese people who could give me some context from the market in Vietnam. Why could this happen? Should we be careful, could this be a scam? I will appreciate any ideas or context!
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Currently in Vietnam for the month and very keen to play some pickup basketball. Looking at previous post makes me unsure if there is much of a scene but would love to play with locals or ex-pats. Mostly will be in the North but interested to hear about any pickup In the country!

                              <span>Last night me (American) and my wife (native Viet) were getting some hotpot in Da Nang. While we were eating three dudes speaking Mandarin walked in pretty loudly (even for Chinese people lol) acting like they owned the place. They were pointing around and looked to be directing the employees. Both of us immediately noticed and exchanged a look. One of them was particularly intense, staring around the room and generally having a hostile vibe. He was making his sauce and one of the ingredients was empty and he practically screamed that they needed more. My wife said the employees looked scared when they walked in. They also grabbed one of the display bottles of alcohol off the top of the sauce bar and shared it. Neither of us were that concerned because we know messing with random people only brings unnecessary attention, but it was very obvious these dudes felt comfortable doing what they wanted in this restaurant. It was interesting and I wonder what other’s thoughts are, or if anyone has had a similar experience.

I wish your country doesn&#x27;t change and hold on to its charms forever, and I also wish you continue to progress. Sure you have your shares of tourist traps like any other countries, but your wonderful, always-smiling and kind people will forever be a warm memory for us.

                              <span>I am a first time visitor of Vietnam, and a Viet Kieu. So far I have had a great time going from Hanoi to Phong Nha, and am now in Da Nang. There was however, one very unpleasant part of my trip and that was the 7 hour bus ride to Da Nang from Phong Nha. 
 Originally, we were going to take the train as we have heard it is a fine and normal way to get there however our homestead really urged us to take the bus, telling us we can lay down and be comfortable and it’ll be faster. We have always been happy with recommendations so we opted to not take the train and had them book the bus for us instead. 
 However, once we got there it was an absolute nightmare. The reclining bus has 3 aisles, which is extremely cramped despite being 5’4”, it was still too short for me to be comfortable in a recli…</span>

Should I just go back to Hanoi after Pu Luong and fly to Laos? I got this idea from looking at the reviews from people who did this at Tong Dau junction but they are very old reviews. First time Vietnam traveler.
 Thanks for any ideas!

                              <span>Hi Reddit, I am interested in booking bamboo airways for domestic flights in Vietnam for April 2024, but I am wondering if I need to worry? I understand that they have some financial problems that mentioned international flights however, for domestic short haul flights I am wondering if it would still be OK to book it. 
 Anyone actually flew in January 2024 with bamboo airways yet? The fact that they are still offering flights, and the news mentioning a restructuring seems a little bit more promising, as though they are really trying to stay alive. Since we will have children with us, I also want to make sure that the reliability of the flights will be fairly decent. I know it may be hard to say, but any input from people who have flown them in the recent weeks would be great as I’ve only seen post from the last few months. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a school teacher and I will be doing a short presentation about Vietnam and Vietnamese culture. I&#x27;m not a native speaker, but I want to make sure my pronunciations are as correct as possible when mentioning đàn t&#x27;rưng and đàn tranh. Would anyone be so kind as to do a short recording of those two phrases? If you&#x27;re more comfortable, you can send via message as well. Also, the recording will only be for my use and not uploaded anywhere else!
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve received recordings! Thank you for your help!

                              <span>Don&#x27;t drive like the locals, that&#x27;s the worst advice everyone. No accidents in 3 years for me riding a Ducati Monster, Ninja 400, Honda Winner X, and Honda ADV150, I took the motorcycle safety course in America and it works and applies everywhere. All of their principals apply to Vietnam as well as they do anywhere else in the world, if you disagree, I&#x27;d like you to tell me what part of MSF was incorrect. If you didn&#x27;t take the MSF course, don&#x27;t rage comment thinking you know what it teaches.
 There are nuances to the flow of traffic but driving like locals means driving like a moron. Things you never do that I learned in the two day MSF course in America that apply perfectly to Vietnam:

                              <span>hello fellas, to make a long story short I’m planning my trip to Vietnam next month. I really really want to do the ha giang loop, but I’m on a tight budget seeing as I’m about to start grad school (as I guess y guys would know, it’s extremelyyyyy expensive). I’ve been looking at articles online and as someone that CANT communicate with the locals would I stand a chance of soloing it ? also any recommendation on ha giang loop (guided) tours? and is it easy to book these types of excursions while already in Vietnam ?
 (Btw my total budget would be around 2500 dollars)

Thực ra em ôm mộng theo ngành TKDH từ lâu rồi í, nhma do hoàn cảnh gia đình nên dạo gần đây em bắt buộc phải cân nhắc lại ý định đó. Nhma, từ trước tới giờ, ngoài cái ngành TKDH ấy ra thì em chưa bao giờ nghĩ tới ngành nào khác nx, kiểu there&#x27;s no plan B whatsoever luôn. 
 Mn xung quanh em thì định hướng em theo ngành giáo viên, một thứ em chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến và gần đây hn như là ám ảnh em luôn í. Trên trường đến những mấy tiết có môn em ko thích hoặc ko liên quan tới ngành học của mình thì đã thấy chán nản, bất cần, ko học, ko quan tâm rồi, còn nếu sau này lên đh hoặc đi làm - làm một công việc mình ko thích, thì em càng thấy tệ hại nữa... Ngành nào cũng yêu cầu sự siêng năng của ng học nhma riêng em thì nếu ko thích thì ko siêng nổi í.

 Vietjetair seems to be the cheapest &amp; easiest travel form. Any suggestions or opinions. Haven’t seen the greatest reviews for it.

                              <span>Okay so its always incredibly difficult to find data on salaries and wages in countries like Vietnam so what we hear is usually hearsay. Usually alot of data isn&#x27;t reliable since there are so many nuance situations relating to salary which is never covered. I&#x27;ve always THOUGHT and HEARD that hcmc has roughly about 20% to 30% higher cost of living than hanoi and the wages are also about higher to the same degree. Having recently lived in hcmc I&#x27;ve been hearing mixed opinions from a few people including locals and business owners who scouted to market to hire talent in both cities. Some lived in both and said it&#x27;s the opposite and people in hanoi generally earn about 20% than hcmc. Others say hcmc is the highest in the country. What are your thoughts. Go ahead and argue, debate, whatever, GO!
 Btw im talking about typical salaries for vietnamese locals, not foreigners which are typically higher.

                              <span>I (41F) traveled solo to Vietnam last year. Before meeting up with my group in Hanoi, I decided to treat myself to a full body massage (as it was listed) at my hotel’s upscale spa. The women there were extremely kind and accommodating. I was given throw away undies to put on and a robe. When I laid down, she had me lay on my back with my breasts fully exposed, which was somewhat uncomfortable. She proceeded to massage my bare breasts for quite a while. I kept thinking to myself, “dont be rude this may be their culture, let her move on to another area…” but when she did, she kept revisiting that area. I eventually told her that area was fine and to focus more on my legs and back. My question is…. Is this normal in Vietnam?

                              <span>I’ve been travelling Vietnam for the past 2 weeks and I’ve had a number of occasions where the easy rider has requested a 200k tip. On top of their fee. 
 I know it’s not a huge amount but I think it’s left a sour taste in my mouth. I want to tip people I feel deserve it for their service, not feel bullied into it. 
 I also had an occasion when in Tam Coc where a woman came along and took photos of everyone, then at the end I felt more or less forced to buy the photos even though I had my eyes closed in them. I ended up just buying them to get the woman off my back. 
 I’ve also met other travellers who have said a similar thing about the boats in Hoi An and how they felt forced to give a tip. 
 Is this common? Or have I and others just been unlucky?

 Im not looking for an agency or studio that assigns a random photographer where photography skill is a hit or miss. 
 Does anyone have experience with this? Maybe your Organisation hires one frequently for such occasions?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 What was everyone&#x27;s experience like in the Marble Mountains? I&#x27;m curious if my own experience was just unique. My partner and I did a deep exploration, and at the end of the trip, we crossed paths with a monk. We greeted him, and he smiled and greeted us back. I was walking behind him and asked if he was heading home for the day. He replied that he was actually about to have dinner, and then, to my surprise, asked if I&#x27;d like to join!
 This took me aback. I hadn&#x27;t heard of anything like this in reviews or posts about the Marble Mountains. He led us to the dining area and asked us to wait. I could see him discussing with the elder head monk and kitchen staff, who seemed hesitant at first. But soon, we were seated with them in the dining hall.
 It was surreal. The monks were full of laughter, jokes, and playful teasing throughout the meal. After everyone finished eating, they encouraged us to keep filling our plates, and the kitchen staff even came out to chat and ask us questions. Then, they surprised us again by inviting me back for breakfast the next morning at 9am, promising it&#x27;s even more fun then – &quot;almost like a party,&quot; they said.
 So, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has ever had such an unexpected encounter? Or did I just experience something truly unique, a memory I&#x27;ll forever cherish as a stroke of luck?

                              <span>On the flight to Melbourne first they take your water away and then make you sit in the sauna plane (air conditioning turned off to save cost) for 40 mins in Saigon heat. Now I have spend next 8 hours in sweaty clothes.
 Dear Vietjet - next time please charge everyone 5 bucks more for the air conditioning. No one said no to paying.

                              <span>Anyone here or their relatives have experience with these perfumes? They are made in Vietnam and some online seller is trying to peddle them to me with a price tag of 200-300 USD. She’s trying to get me to buy them for my aunts in Vietnam saying how it is a really popular perfume for the fancier city folks there. A Chanel Number 5 bottle is below 150 bucks here in the states so at that price tag these gotta be insanely fragrant. I am leaning towards her being full of shit but since I never tried it I thought I would ask to learn from you guys.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a giant of a person, super tall and also fat, so it&#x27;s hard not to notice me and I figure, especially with that video with the corrupt customs, I&#x27;ll be picked out of a crowd far easier. I&#x27;m used to it since in Mexico I&#x27;ve had to be chummy with officers before but in those cases I had the advantage of being Mexican and speaking the language.
 I plan on taking a few cheap watches, what I do for Mexico, just in case but is that something that doesn&#x27;t translate well to Vietnam?

                              <span>I am planning to travel Ninh Binh to Hue by Train. There 2 people, with 1 large and 1 small luggage each of us (4 total). I heard they limit 20kg total, but we are def over.. Do they really check weight? How much do they cost if extra weight? Does the large luggage goes along with us or we have to drop it off to another cart? This will be my first time on the VN train. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m going to north vietnam towards the end of this January and Sapa is in one of my list. Haven&#x27;t booked accommodation for my visit there tho. That gonna bite me in the arse i think. I heard that it&#x27;s difficult to find place to stay in January especially in mountainous area like Sapa. 
 How is the weather there this month? Is it wet and cold and generally terrible like I&#x27;ve heard so much or is it not that bad? 
 When is the exact date for Tet festival this year?

                              <span>Hi we are travelling to Saigon for the second time and would like a hotel/serviced apartment in/near the city centre to cut down on the travelling time. 
 Please give your recommendations for one with a kids pool (must have) and kids playroom (optional but good to have). 
 This will help us a lot in our planning! Thank you :)

We have about 20k USD saved so far but we are hoping to have double that by the time we leave. This will be our first time living outside North America. Please specify what currency you are speaking about :) thank you!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m traveling in Hanoi (in Old quarters) and walked the streets over and over looking for sit down restaurants that served bun rieu or bun Ca, but couldn&#x27;t find any. I rarely even saw any sit down restaurant in that area. So that got me thinking of it was only a street side restaurant thing? Or does anyone have recommendations for sit down restaurants that serve these? 
 Am traveling with a toddler and can&#x27;t do street side restaurants.

                              <span>I’ll be in Hanoi next month and want to do the Ha Giang loop with a hostel. I’d like to find a hostel that offers smaller group tours with the easy rider option. I’ll be traveling solo and enjoy the benefit and flexibility of a smaller group. Thanks for the recs ☺️

                              <span>Hello! I am a Canadian heading to Vietnam in March for two weeks :) I’m curious if I should exchange all my Canadian cash to VND in Canada, then Bring it on the flight. Or bring a small amount of CAD and exchange it once i land in HCMC, then use ATMs to withdraw cash as needed, thanks

                              <span>growing up, my family has always taken me back to vietnam for the summer, and i have loved it always. we really don’t do anything special. just visit family in saigon and go to malls and eat out often. i was born and raised in the us, but i have this very strong passion and love for the motherland and my culture. weirdly enough, i cry a lot thinking about how far away i am from “home”, even though i was never born or raised there. i miss vietnam a lot, and count the days when i’ll be able to be back again. compare to a lot of my viet friends here, i’m the one most passionate about our heritage and culture, and sometimes i feel really out of place. one of my biggest dream is to move and work there one day. i was never able to find anyone who felt the same way. and to be honest i feel slightly weird and insane for feeling the way i do and “homesick” for vietnam. i’m kind of in this weird limbo where i don’t feel “american” enough when i’m with ppl from the us, and i also don’t feel “viet” enough when i’m with my ppl back home too. does anyone feel this way as well?

                              <span>Does this sound familiar? Yes of course there are extremely nice people in Vietnam, but I believe every country has people who are nice. This could be controversial, but the reason why some foreigners say that is because they are white (or black even), so they get the preferential treatment. Cos they look different. By speaking a little Vietnamese, the Vietnamese people are super impressed and treat you even better. Vietnamese people are a curious bunch and they haven&#x27;t gotten much opportunity to interact with a white/black person.
 Can I say the same for how Vietnamese treat each other? How about foreigners who are from SEA and look exactly like a Vietnamese? I fall into the second category, and typically Vietnamese only treat me a LITTLE better after they realise I&#x27;m a foreigner (vì nói chuyện hơi lơ lớ). I run a small food business and I see ALL kinds of people. Conversely, if I were white, I&#x27;d imagine it to be a whole lot different.
 So yes, Vietnamese people can be friendly (just as any other country) but it really seem like an overstatement to say that they are some of the friendliest people in the world.
 Edit: Just wanna re-emphasize that I am in no means trying to say Vietnamese people are not friendly or ill-mannered or whatsoever. Every country has both nice and nasty people. I&#x27;m just saying Westerners getting preferential treatment shouldn&#x27;t be mistaken that Vietnamese ppl are the friendliest people in the world. It&#x27;s a huge overstatement.

                              <span>Our current bungalow bum gun has extremely high pressure blast that feels like needles in my butthole. 
 Pulling the trigger a little less doesn&#x27;t help, it&#x27;s just all or nothing. Is there any other adjustment or hack to make it feel less traumatizing?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 So in 2018 I bought a motorcycle in Hanoi and drove it to Saigon. One of the best experiences of my life. I am now married and me and the wife are wanting to go to Hanoi and do the loop that I missed.
 ​
 With that being said I am a bit confused as alot of people are suggesting we take a bus to Ha giang and then do the loop from there. Whereas we are happy to have a longer trip and go more out of the way if possible.
 ​
 Any and all suggestions welcome!
 ​
 Thanks all

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a distant cousin in Vietnam who&#x27;s either scamming people or being scammed, but I have not much understanding of the country whatsoever... so can you help guessing what kind of situation this might be?
 He&#x27;s a 20-odd year old with a high school degree but no work experience whatsoever, the type that plays video games all day long fed by parents. Not very intelligent at all but speaks some mediocre English. One day suddenly he&#x27;s got a &#x27;great job offer&#x27; from someone, but he says he just can&#x27;t tell any details, except that somehow we know:
  
He says his job is just to repeatedly click things; the more clicks the better pay
 He says he &#x27;will get paid&#x27; ~3K USD per month, not sure if he&#x27;s lying or if it&#x27;ll ever be paid. AFAIK he got paid a little, but three months in, he&#x27;s still asking parents for borrowing money.
 He must live in where he works, in Hanoi. He can meet parents occasionally. So at least he&#x27;s not (yet) sold to Cambodia...
 He must work at night
 Once a &#x27;stupid colleague&#x27; revealed their IP address or something; entire &#x27;company&#x27; must shut down operation and move physically, worrying police will finding out.
 Five people work there
  
Not sure if he&#x27;s a criminal or a victim, or both. He&#x27;s idealistic and naive--he tried trading cryptos with worst timing possible, lost parents&#x27; money; tried making a gaming Youtube channel for profit but got only 100 views, gave up in two weeks. Wants &#x27;modernising&#x27; parents&#x27; mom-and-pop shop before he can help with family business.
 Parents thinks he&#x27;s in an actual &#x27;employee&#x27; of some criminal activities... I think he&#x27;ll eventually be sold to Cambodia.
 What can this possibly be?

                              <span>Does anyone know of any doctors in HCMC or Da Nang that specialize in allergies? I’ve had a long term allergy that only comes up when I’m in SEA, and it seems worse this trip.
 I’ve been a half dozen doctors in various countries with no luck. They usually just give me antihistamines and send me on my way. 
 Looking to get a full panel of skin and blood tests. I’ve already reached out to Vinmec and am waiting on a reply.

                              <span>Hello all! Sooo I&#x27;ve fucked up and the police took the bike(125cc scooter). Here is the situation:
 - 1.3 blood alcohol
 - Expired IDP
 - Blue card under a different name 
 Can I realistically expect to get the bike back? What would happen if I don&#x27;t show up to collect the bike/pay the fine and just move on? I&#x27;m planning to stay here a bit longer so I&#x27;m not sure if that will impact anything. They also have a picture of my passport.

                              <span>As in the title. 
 I have been here for some time. I know the country well. There were times I was thrilled to be here. 
 But since the Covid period there has been a gradual decline in my view of living here. 
 Part of it I think personal - me needing pasteurs new. Part of it I think is environment - my surroundings. 
 The volume levels, trash, air and water pollution, huge overdevelopment and bewildering approach to governance has me unhappy. 
 I think knowing I can never be a citizen, I can never buy property, and things like have police doing random passport checks at my house now at 2am has something to do with it to. As much as i&#x27;ve loved the country, it doesn&#x27;t love me back or accept me and it never will. 
 Curious to see if I am an outlier in feeling this way, or if anyone else has similar feelings. If so, i&#x27;m interested in seeing if this is just a phase and will pass, or whether I am in a downward spiral towards inevitable departure.

                              <span>I flew to Vietnam with a small 7 lb (3.629 kg) Yorkshire Terrier. I am trying to fly out of the country next month to Thailand. 
 The only airline that allows my pet on board with me appears to be Vietnam Airlines. When I explained the dimensions of my dog’s carrier the employee told me it was too big. Truthfully, my dog’s carrier is hardly bigger than my dog itself as it is. So any smaller is hard to fathom.
 She told me the required measurements. I have looked online like crazy. I’ve seen small kennels and even extra small kennels. I have not seen any kennel available for purchase that is under the maximum allowed measurements (30cm X 35cm X 20cm).
 It has to be a solid constructed kennel which makes it more difficult and narrows it down even more. The carrying case I flew with is a fabric based one so I couldn’t use a same style for this airplane apparently.
 Does anyone have an idea where I could find such a kennel? Would be very grateful for any help!

                              <span>I always see mix reviews about Vietnam. People go to Hanoi or Saigon and let that dictate their opinion about this place. I think Vietnam just has this natural beauty to it when compared to Thailand. Certain things in Thailand feel forced where as in Vietnam it’s natural. No disrespect to Thailand of course. I enjoy both countries but something about Vietnam just captures me more.

                              <span>I need to rant. I hate the way the locals drive. But I&#x27;m increasingly seeing foreigners especially whites driving the same way they would NEVER drive back home. 
 Was in a Grab today and this guy on his bike kept squeezing to the right side of my grab will riding in between the lane marker, never once using his side mirror. Driver honk him once asking him to go back to his lane. He then moved away and sped. Then after about 300meters , he does the same thing again. 
 This time he gave a middle finger to the driver. I wind down my window and I can see he was taken aback that there was someone behind. I shouted at him &quot;Use your fucking side mirror&quot;. As soon I shouted at him in English, he quickly sped off and dissapear from sight. 
 Seems to me that he only dares to drive shitty and show the finger to locals. Doesn&#x27;t dare to engage when I confront him. If you&#x27;re in Reddit and seeing this,, fuck you asshole. Drive like how you&#x27;d drive in your home country. Use your fucking side mirrors and indicators when trying to switch lanes.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m travelling to Vietnam on the 26th January for 16 days. 
 After reading into entry requirements for Vietnam it says a passport cannot be damaged, but it&#x27;s unclear what the exact definition of damage is. 
 Does this passport look too damaged to be accepted? The cover has some evident wear and tear from stickers that have been placed on the back but the chip will work fine and as far as I can tell the ID page is okay except the slightest little crease to the laminate.
 I do have just enough time to get it replaced but it&#x27;s £155 to get it done so quickly and I am short on money at the moment so ideally would prefer to avoid this option if possible.
 Thank you

                              <span>We know it&#x27;s not long at all, but would love to fit in as much as possible. 
 We are meeting friends who arrive a couple days after us in Ho Chi Min, so have to stay there for 4 days. Are there any day trips elsewhere that would be recommended? 
 We then plan to do:
 2 days Dalat 
 Hoi An 
 Da Nang
 Hanoi
 Ha Long Bay 
 Then we fly back out of Ho Chi Min to Australia on the 12th day in the evening.
 ​
 Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you :)

                              <span>Hello everyone. My partner and I are planning to do a day trip to Ninh Binh from Hanoi on 01/31. We want to use the train from Ga Hanoi to Ninh Binh and back. We are from the US so we cannot ride motorbikes in Ninh Binh. Please help us plan this trip with your knowledge and experience.
  
Should we buy the round-trip train tickets from Hanoi to Ninh Binh now? Can anyone please share your experience using the train? This is the website we were recommended to use: https://dsvn.vn/#/timkiem/ketqua
 Is Grab available to get around in Ninh Binh? If not, how can we get around? We plan to visit Trang An, Dancing Mountain, and maybe Hoa Lu if possible.
  
Thank you so much!

                              <span>Hey guys,
 i already searching for days now but don’t find a final answer…
 I plan to fly from Bangkok to DaNang airport and have my DJI-Mini drone with me. I saw some posts about problems with confections in this cases. Does anyone have some actual experiences/informations with this?
 Are domestic flights also a problem? Maybe I can stay one night in Saigon before to avoid this struggles…
 Thanks in advance for your support!

 Mình luôn sợ người nhà đi làm về muộn.
 Mình sợ người nhà bị tai nan, hay bệnh tật ung thư, người gầy đi rồi mất. 
 Ba mẹ càng già đi mình càng sợ. 
 Mình tưởng tượng đến cảnh ba, mẹ mất, nằm trong quan tài, đặt trong nhà, kèn đám ma... Mình cũng ko biết lúc đó sẽ thế nào nữa. Mình chỉ muốn trốn đi, mình sợ chứng kiến cảnh đó và ở đó lâu... 
 Lập gđ mình cũng sợ chứng kiến cái chết của vợ chồng con cái... 
 Nhà đã neo người, mình đã ít mqh xã hội. Khi người thân, ba mẹ mất. Sẽ thấy cô độc tận cùng. Nhà sẽ trống vắng đi. Cảm giác ko có chỗ dựa. Ko có cảm giác an toàn.
 Sợ ở một mình cũng phải mạnh mẽ mà đối diện khi trong người đầy sợ hãi...

                              <span>Hey guys. 
 I’ve been living in Saigon for the past 7 years and I’m finally getting tired of the chaos. I’ve been to Danang a few times for travel and it seems like a pretty decent spot to settle down and live a more peaceful life.
 I was wondering if anyone who has lived there could give me some insight on what’s it like and the pros and cons. Or if someone would recommend another city within Vietnam that would be cool too.
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hello everyone! I’m from the UK and I arrived in Da Nang last night and I’m staying for a month in an apartment. Today I tried to go stock up on things like toilet paper, bin bags and some kitchen essentials. I tried two different shops which were described as ‘supermarkets’ on Google maps and I couldn’t find these, even when I asked the employee (using Google translate). Are there specific shops for these things? I also try to track my macros and this is difficult to do when eating out / ordering in so I want to cook some of my meals at home, i haven’t yet found a shop where I can buy chicken, veg and stuff like that. What’s my best bet? Is it markets? If so, can anyone suggest a good one? For reference I’m staying at the edge of the My An area. 
 Another thing, I would like to hire a moped to get around the city, can anyone recommend a good hire place for this? I have an international driving licence but not for motorbikes so I need something with a smaller engine, is this available here? Alternatively, how likely am I to get stopped by police when driving around? I’d like to drive myself to hoi an but I don’t want to risk a fine if I get a bigger bike without having a licence for it. I would also like to do the hai van pass but I don’t know if that would be possible on a 50cc as I’ve heard it’s hilly. If you have any other suggestions or tips for me that would be much appreciated! Thanks everyone!

                              <span>Hello! I really hope you can help recommend me some areas in Vietnam . If you know the country well please read on, I am over coming some health issues and whilst I am healthy generally, I am looking for some sunshine and peace to see me through this rough patch before coming back to the uk in six months . I would need access to shops and restaurants still and phamacies. I do want to be close to the sea as I find the ocean healing. I don’t want party areas really but still need some civilisation. I’d like to have affordable accommodation for a couple months at least to get my bearings. Thanks so much all!!!

                              <span>Hi there,
 I love to find unusual things to eat and restaurants with a unique atmosphere. I am sure that some of you do as well ! I am going in South-East Asia on a backpacking trip starting in Hanoï and I am wondering if some of you have food experiences to share. I am sure it would help a lot of people !
 So far, I have listed : Pho, Egg Coffee, Banh Cuon, Banh Xeo, Steamed Snails, Banh Mi, what else do you have in mind ?
 I was also thinking to create a group to share this knowledge along the path, tell me what you think !

                              <span>Me and my boyfriend met 1 year ago and I met his parents around 3 months in. I&#x27;m Nigerian and his background is Vietnamese, but his ideals are more in line with Western cultures.
 When I see his parents we get along and I always have dinner with them, if I&#x27;m staying I make sure to clean up after myself, not get in their way and also do the dishes when his mum makes dinner for us.
 Recently I had a problem since he&#x27;s going to get busy soon as he&#x27;s starting a new business so I stayed with him and his parents for around 6 days. He thought it wasn&#x27;t a problem but when I went to work his mum told him that it wasn&#x27;t my home and that I wasn&#x27;t his &quot;partner&quot; so I shouldn&#x27;t be staying there for so long.
 I then messaged her to apologise the next day and she told me that in Vietnamese culture an unmarried girl cannot stay at her bfs house for too long and it&#x27;s fine if it&#x27;s a couple of days or a weekend.
 My boyfriend also stays at mine for over 6 days sometimes and my parents are fine with it, but I think it&#x27;s a difference in culture. Could someone help me understand more about this and let me know things I should be more aware of? 
 Thank you!

                              <span>My wife and I are in the process of registering for my spousal TRC and it&#x27;s been one headache after another.
 First, we tried our luck at the HCMC immigration office and apparently the law JUST changed so that we can only get it done at my wife&#x27;s home province.
 So leaving no other choice, we both had to take days off from work to go my wife&#x27;s home province. 
 However, once we got here, we found out her home province is in a disagreement with HCMC immigration policy and refuses to issue TRCs, just a 6mo visa.
 With all that said, I don&#x27;t know what to do this at point. I&#x27;ve gone through lawyers before when I obtained my TRC through setting up a business here and tbh, I ended up doing all the work. All they did was go physically submit my papers. Furthermore, I don&#x27;t think I have to reopen a company just for a TRC when I&#x27;m legally eligible for a TRC.
 Sigh.

                              <span>Saw these in one of the busy market streets in Hanoi, at the start of my trip. Looking to find the same in HCMC (Charmander in first pic specifically) but nowhere seems to have it. Have tried Ben Thanh market, and will keep looking in Hai An bookstore and Fahasa but still no luck. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m considering a teaching job in Hanoi at a new international school. The start day is early August. 
 I&#x27;ve lived abroad before (China) but have been back in the US for 4.5 years and am currently living/working in Denver. 
 I was interested in hearing about life in Hanoi from those who currently live there. 
 Some top of the mind questions/concerns are: 
 How is the pollution? Would you consider the city clean? Is there a large expat community? Is it close-knit? Is it easy to form friend groups? Are there things to do other than go out to eat/drink? What is the fitness scene like? Is there a road biking scene? Is it easy to get out of the city on the weekend for some nature/beach time?
 Any other tips/advice is greatly appreciated. TYIA!

                              <span>hi all!
 i am going to be on a trip to vietnam in the next week, traveling from hanoi down to hcmc over the span of two weeks. 
 i was wondering what the masking requirements are like for covid-19? are they mandated places or required for entry anywhere? are locals frequently using them? should i plan to bring some with me?
 i visited taiwan in early 2023 and things were still pretty strict, and masks were everywhere. i was wondering if vietnam would be similar! 
 thanks!

                              <span>I have an upcoming trip to Vietnam and definitely want to do a cruise in Halong Bay, most likely 2 day/1 night. (Yes, I’ve heard about the drawbacks, but I still want to experience it) I’m overwhelmed with the different ways available to book and all the different cruises available. I’m looking for a cruise that will also provide transportation from and back to Hanoi. I’d rather book ahead of time rather than trying to go through a hotel.. Is booking.com a legit way to book these cruises or should I go directly through the cruise website? And which cruise companies would you recommend?

                              <span>hello hello, i&#x27;m a vietnamese-american living in the west coast of america, and i&#x27;d like to ask, does anyone know how to purchase việt phục from vietnam and have them exported to america? i have interest in the việt phục movement and would love to wear and support our traditional and modernized việt phục in the USA (especially since a lot of attire like nhật bình or ngũ thân aren&#x27;t sold in local vietnamese stores where i live), but unfortunately, i&#x27;m not familiar with how i could try to work with purchasing and delivering overseas.
 from what i know, there&#x27;s shopee vn where i could purchase clothes, but they only ship locally in vietnam, and i&#x27;m unaware of any facebook groups i could join where i could ask for help with proxy shipping. thank you for reading, and any help is appreciated!

                              <span>Sorry if this isn&#x27;t the right place fore this post, but it&#x27;s the only logical place I know of to get the answer.
 When sending a longer (40-60 sec.) video in Zalo chat, does anybody else experience the video and audio to be out of sync? It&#x27;s like the video is slowed down, but the audio stays at normal speed. Also the file size is really small compared to the original recording. It&#x27;s like Zalo is re-encoding the video and screwing it all up😅
 Only noticed it recently, and the issue is happening to both me and the recipient. Shorter videos are not affected.

                              <span>Here are some variety shows/youtubers who have their own English sub (not yt auto generated) for those who aren&#x27;t fluent in Vietnamese but still want to enjoy some Vietnamese content. (this is my first post so please tell me if I do anything wrong)
 @TheHanoiChamomile: Not all his videos have English subtitles, but I know his vlogs does have them. the subtitles do also have other languages such as Arabic, Japanese, Korean etc.
 @KhoaiLangThang: food vlogger. I think everyone knows him. all his videos have eng subs.
 2 NGÀY 1 DÊM VIỆT: This is the Vietnamese version of Korean show called 2 Days &amp; 1 Night. They are still working on the subtitles. I believe at this moment they are at episode 14. 
 THE NEW MENTOR: This is a show about modelling. only watched 2 episodes but I think all the episodes have English subs. 
 THỬ THÁCH LỚN KHÔN: a show about little children and it&#x27;s so cute. both seasons 1 and 2 have eng subs.
 RAP VIET MUA 3: I think the title speaks for itself :). they used to have season 1 and I think also season 2 on yt but now not anymore. If I remember it correctly some of the eps miss subs but I&#x27;m not sure if they fixed that.
 NGƯỜI ẤY LÀ AI?: here is a link to season 5 ep 1. I haven&#x27;t watched the show myself a lot, but I know it&#x27;s a very popular one.
 THE MASKED SINGER VIETNAM S2: only watched some performances but both seasons 1 and 2 have English subtitles.
 I hope this was usefull!! Please give your recommendations so we can help each other out.
 (Also a tip for those want to watch some shows with viet dub: if you have Netflix, a lot of shows have now viet dub. I personally watch kdramas with viet dub and eng sub. I think in settings you can indicate multiple prefered languages.)

                              <span>Pretty much the title. I live in Germany, both my parents are Vietnamese and I grew up speaking vietnamese and german.
 But I feel like my vietnamese language skills are just kinda limited to daily stuff at home. Doesn’t go much beyond it and I’ve wondered how I might improve, or just have some resources so I can maintain a certain language level so I just won’t forget with time.

                              <span>I have just come back from vacation in Phu Quoc. I met this amazing guy who works as a waiter at his family’s restaurant. When we first saw each other - we couldn’t stop staring. It felt like my body was immediately set on fire when we made eye contact. I went to the restaurant every single day, at least twice a day. We never had a real conversation but we were always looking at each other. 
 When he was taking someone else’s order - he couldn’t stop staring at me - his dad had to tell him to “stop staring at that girl &amp; focus on taking the order”. He’d play songs that I suggested &amp; we’d dance together - all while maintaining eye contact and smiling ear to ear at each other. 
 I was absolutely dying to get his socials &amp; stay in contact but I couldn’t muster up the courage to just ask &amp; when I finally did - he wasn’t there. 
 On my last day - I stayed at the restaurant from breakfast till closing time. He gave me my favourite orders &amp; drinks for free because I told him I’d be leaving that night. 
 Now that I’m back home - I have this huge empty feeling of loss - deep inside my stomach. Thinking of him makes my chest hurt &amp; feel heavy. I can’t stop myself from crying when I think about his face smiling at me. 
 In those few weeks of endless tension, smiles &amp; eye contact - I had never felt happier. He makes me feel alive just by looking into my eyes. He makes me feel absolutely blissfuly happy in a way that I’ve never felt before &amp; I’ve never even properly spoken to him. 
 I am desperately planning to go back to Phu Quoc later this year because I feel physically sick at the thought of never seeing him again. 
 Idk what it is - if it’s just me romanticising just a simple vacation crush &amp; being delusional or if there is something actually there. 
 I feel so empty without him &amp; it’s so silly of me because I don’t even know his name. 
 What’s going on? What do I do.. I desperately need advice/another perspective on this.

                              <span>Im currently on my way to Saigon and I have stopped by 3 pit stops that look fairly cleaned on the outside. But when I went into the restroom to do my business I find toilet stalls that are un flushed. It doesn’t take that much effort to flush!! We want to reputable as a nation but we can’t even do the most common action.

                              <span>Even the popular, must go, places have dirty walls, trash all over the floor, dirty tables, utensils that have never seen a drop of soap. My first few jobs were in food service and half the time was spent cleaning. I don&#x27;t even want to think about what happens in the food prep areas. Why do people even frequent places like that. Back home (3rd world country) it wouldn&#x27;t matter how good your food is, if you have a dirty establishment no one would stay and eat.
 Edit1: A lot of people are not reading the text. I never said anything about the preparation of the food. I meant how dirty the establishments are. In my third world country, even in family owned businesses, cleanliness is very important at least just for looks. The prep might be another story. 
 And before people try to pull the western standards card, is it really a western standard to have a clean presentable place to eat? What a way to devalue your own country and culture. It shouldn&#x27;t be defended.

                              <span>So I ordered a Yamaha keyboard before Christmas. It turned out that it did not have MIDI port, so I packed it and sent it back.
 Today (2 weeks later) I got a message saying the package was damaged.
 Here is the photo they sent:
 https://preview.redd.it/r8k1ihypgxac1.png?width&#x3D;651&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;b028b8e050c37a030b675390b258c605a8845d58
 This is obviously untrue because the package was fine when I sent it to them. It means it was probably damaged during transportation or even damaged by these &quot;quality checkers&quot; themselves.
 The keyboard itself is obviously fine, as well as have all the accessories inside the box:
 https://preview.redd.it/yfb64hvvgxac1.png?width&#x3D;489&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;65b1b48fed7bbb2e1ef38ce852b84c4f88fc101b
 I don&#x27;t know what to do at this point. The app says that they will send it back to me with some paper to sign. I don&#x27;t want to sign anything because this is just ridiculous.
 Is &quot;damaged package&quot; a real legal reason to reject return? This is not the case in my home country, don&#x27;t know about Vietnam though. But hey, they could have damaged the package themselves. What should I do at this point?
 P. S., they have my return photo which I took right before sending it back
 ​
 the package is obviously undamaged

                              <span>I&#x27;m staying in Hoi An at the moment, just north west of old town and next to a school. This morning there was music being broadcast over a loudspeaker, quite pop, animated music for 30 mins. What was this for? The primary school opposite was full of motorbikes and people coming in constantly. A few kids but mostly adults alone.
 Just nosey really! Wondered if anyone knew the reason for the early wake up this morning!
 Edit - Sorry if I offended anyone, I wasn&#x27;t asking why people are noisy I was just curious! I did try googling but found no information so thought I&#x27;d ask on here if this was a common thing. I&#x27;m trying to learn more about the culture I swear! 😂

                              <span>okay so i am half Vietnamese and not very connected to my culture. I wanted to hang a flag in my room so i got a tapestry of the Vietnam flag. The thing is i got this one 🇻🇳 which is the national flag. Is that okay? I am actually south vietnamese but i thought the south flag was outdated since vietnam is no longer seperated. Also, my parents think it might be offensive because its a communist flag but they are unsure as well.
 So basically, is the vietnam flag 🇻🇳 okay to hang if im south vietnamese? And is it offensive because i dont want to represent anything that is like communism? Should i just buy the south vietnamese flag?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I am going to Hà Giang hoping to film a documentary about the local ethnic minorities groups of the region, how tourism has effected the region and about the issue of children begging tourists for money in and around Hà Giang.
 Since my Vietnamese is not very good I am looking for a Vietnamese speaker to accompany me as a guide / translator / interpreter. I don&#x27;t mind if they are not from a film background as long as they are passionate about film and creative. 
 Send me a direct message and ill send you the Pitch deck and more info 
 Im not sure if this is right place to post this but thought I would give it a try!!
 Thank you.

                              <span>I booked tickets for my family and my wife&#x27;s aunt and her husband to travel together from the US to SE Asia. How much can each of our family bring without declaring? I understand 10K per family but since we&#x27;re traveling together and on the same ticket, does this count as a single family? I read an article where the flight attendants got in trouble because they counted as a party and carried over the limit.

                              <span>I travel to Vietnam in February and 14th of February I am planning to leave Hanoi and move to Central Vietnam, in Da Nang.
 Fare prices have been a lot higher than usual (95 EUR single trip) for almost a month since I am tracking them. But they mostly keep its high price, they dont fluctuate either up or down.
 Sice its almost a month before the flight, as many know, this is a period when the prices start moving and when you can usually pick a good deal.
 I would like to ask knowleable people about in this, do you think is possible that the price is high yet just because of the expectation and it can still drop down, or there more likely there is a really high demand even the 4th day after Tet (as far as I read, most of the people travel before not after Tet)?
 Do I risk that the fare will be completely sold out if I wait longer?
 I would like to hear from the people who have know how this works, please don&#x27;t post your advices based only on your feelings if you are not experienced in searching cheap fares.
 ​
 EDIT: also I am wondering, about something. Do you think that if I make the reservation to the point I am selecting the seats, this is a real view of how fully is being the flight booked or not? Free seats means not sold yet or they can be sold to 3rd agencies (KAYAK, KIWI...) but yet not sold to the end party... Anybody knows?

I am mainly looking at the 2 day / 1 night options but am stuck trying to decide between Hang En, Hang Va, and Hang Tien. Any opinions/advice from people who have done one or more of these tours?

I’ll be travelling with kids so would prefer a stocked pond or the like where gear is supplied and catch and release is practised. Cheers

                              <span>Hi guys, I have secured a round-trip flight to Ho Chi Minh City for a 6-day duration. I&#x27;m considering to explore other destinations within this time frame, as I think spending the entire 6 days in Ho Chi Minh City might be too long. Any suggestions considering that I have to leave from Ho Chi Minh on day 6? Thank you !

                              <span>Earlier I made a post about wanting to buy liquor for myself, however now I want to buy some for my father, and as of such now care about the realness of the liquor. I found what seemed to be a chain selling the Whiskey I wanted for my father at a reasonable price, the shop being WineMart.
 Thanks in advance, PPM

                              <span>We prepaid 50% for an 11:30 to 5:00 (17:00) cruise through a tour company (900K VNĐ each total not prepay). We arrived on time and received a ticket from the ship personnel which stated 290K VNĐ each. 
 The boat was large and comfortable. We excitedly disembarked at the first stop at a large cave. There were maybe 1,000 people walking through the cave which meant walking up steps was 1 or 2 steps at a time. At points where pictures could be taken, there were no less than 50 large boats present in the shot. 
 The other two stops to kayak and hike were very short and had boats and tourists everywhere. The smell of exhaust from the boats was bad. 
 After disembarking after the day was complete, we thought the tour company made a mistake ( even though my wife is Vietnamese and fluent) since the boat ticket said 290K vnđ and we already paid 900K VNĐ. 
 As we left the docks, the tour company contacts us again to pay the second 900K vnđ. When my wife asks about the 290K vnđ tickets, she is told “that does not include your food”. Our food was a mediocre lunch. 
 Are we to believe that the boat trip cost 290k vnđ per person and the food cost 610k vnđ per person? Haha. Please. 
 My advice is to only book directly with the cruise line. And only do that if you don’t mind paying to be elbow to elbow with tourists
 I will get many downvotes from the tour operators but I bet I get few rebuttals from them

But sadly that I&#x27;m not a Top tier educated person, so he blamed me alot. He doesn&#x27;t care about me emotionally, he doesn&#x27;t care about my interests or hobbies. He only cares about my study. I know Im a big boi with self awareness. But I have no voice to raise in my family, even if I do so, I still get stomped on then get called immature. It&#x27;s hard for me to connect relationship with him. Do you have any experience similar to mine? How do you cope?

                              <span>I had the misfortune of staying a week in one of the rental &quot;luxury&quot; vinhomes within Landmark 81 area. Nearly everthing was falling apart. A dystopian nightmare. I had beautiful scenic views of other apartment windows, clothes drying on balconies, and shirtless old men. The location is nice, but sterile.
 If this is quality indicative of Vingroup, my condolences to students of Vinschool, patients of Vinmec and drivers of Vinfast cars.
 I had to cross the busy street by foot (what a memorable experience as a pedestrian) to get to the other side of what I would consider real Vietnam. There I was able to get Com Tam breakfast for 35k, then walk across the street to buy pet supplies, get a haircut, a sugercane drink, and some photocopying required to get me and my pet out of Vietnam.

                              <span>I moved to the US when I was young so I&#x27;m not well-versed in Vietnamese cuisine, though when I visited my auntie in another state she asked for a side bowl of nước béo and was surprised that I didn&#x27;t know what it was. Are there any other food where an add-on is not on the menu but can be order? It would be a shame to missed out on good flavor. Thank you.

                              <span>So Vietnamese uses the Latin alphabet. But it used Chinese characters/Chữ Nôm up until French colonialism. From what I can tell in Vietnam proper the Latin alphabet is used basically exclusively. But in my local diaspora community and other places I still see Chinese characters along side the Latin script. 
 Is it just because they’re such deep diaspora? Or is there another reason.

                              <span>I’d like to preface this by saying that I absolutely LOVE Vietnam. I have previously lived here for 8 years and have just returned for 5 weeks. And as an American, I understand intimately that no country is perfect. But,
 Vietnamese bedding is the worst I&#x27;ve ever known. The fabrics are scratchy, the blankets are tiny, and the fabric designs look like they are from the imagination of a blind goblin. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible to make so many colors clash all at once.
 My Viet wife says it&#x27;s China&#x27;s fault.
 Edit: This is half satire. Amuse yourself at my expense, I enjoy it.

                              <span>I want to treat my husband to the best hair wash and head massage in Da Nang. Which spa should I go to for this? I’ve checked all of TripAdvisor and Google reviews but it’s hard to find the places that do the relaxing hair wash / massage.

                              <span>These fuckers work like scammers, yet there&#x27;s no one ever questioning or trying to do anything about it. 
 -Unblockable fuckers like Home Credit. They just fucking keep messaging you and the best you could do was deleting message history. 
 -Random people adding you to random unblockable group chat. You have 0 idea who was the fucker who added you there. You can&#x27;t turn off that function where people add you to random group chat either.
 -&quot;Explore&quot;/&quot;Khám phá&quot; tab that is unable to be removed. The elderly who are not fluent with smartphones keep randomly subcribed for random shits in this tab. 
 Edit: Forgot about this shit too: old files keep getting deleted. They are not even that old and you can&#x27;t control it either. Can&#x27;t increase or decrease the time where Zalo considers it to be old. -Suggestion of random people which I&#x27;m sure 90% don&#x27;t give a shit about. Like if you wanted to add somebody as friend on Zalo, you usually take their numbers and add them. Not from suggestion. That&#x27;s like the entire fucking point of Zalo: Phone numbers with a profile. It&#x27;s the most useless shit ever and it has no right to be on &quot;message&quot; tab. Like Zalo is trying too fucking hard to become like Facebook or some shit. Zalo is forgetting their original users and Vietnamese are too forgiving.

                              <span>I booked a grabbike in ho chi Minh and the driver jumped a signal and made the pedestrians stop crossing the road. One pissed off tourist was about to smack my head and not the drivers head which pissed me off. I am a tourist as well. It just didn&#x27;t make sense that he redirected all his anger towards me and started abusing and showing his middle finger. I know he is justified to get angry with the driving by the grab driver, but to almost take it out on me looked incredibly stupid.

                              <span>I am currently a foreign resident living in the US, but I am planning to move to Vietnam as a nomad for a year or more (I hold vietnamese passport, but not a resident). I am interested in opening a bank account in Vietnam that can easily work with USD and international banking accounts such as Bank of America and Capital One. Could you recommend any Vietnam bank account suitable for my requirements?

My boyfriend and I want to explore the north of Vietnam on a low budget trip in September and want to have an authentic trip.( we are from Europe) Do you have any tips on the route, things we could do, sightseeing must-sees and also tips on the weather and the costs for such a trip in September, around 3 weeks? We are both very interested in culture and also like surfing and are generally very open minded people. Do you have any tips for a travel experience? we would be very happy... greeting form Austria :)

                              <span>Hi! I have a very strong suspicion of having ADHD and it has made my life pretty painful, but i don’t know if there are any clinic available in Hai Phong or any place that could do virtual sessions and ship prescriptions to my city.

                              <span>So nearly had a crash on the back of a grab bike tonight, it was not my drivers fault at all, basically another scooter veered into us and my driver steered away which then lead us dead on with another car. Luckily my driver &amp; the car both slammed the breaks on, the scooter I was on just bumping slightly into the car infront. 
 Posting this just to say BE SO CAREFUL here on the roads. Even if you&#x27;re on the back of a bike with a grab driver, it is wild. 
 My heart is still racing over an hour later from the ordeal. Absolutely no idea how we got out with no damage and without falling off! 
 Again, if you&#x27;re travelling in vietnam seriously the roads ain&#x27;t no joke here. Be careful. 
 Good luck &amp; stay safe yo!

Hai hôm trước em ấy có kể cho mình một chuyện mà mình k biết phải đưa ra cho em ấy lời khuyên gì nữa. Mình có xin phép em cho mình kể câu chuyện này trên đây để mong mọi ng giúp mình đưa ra lời khuyên. Em ấy kể rằng từ lâu mẹ em ấy đã có thói quen ôm em ấy khi ngủ, hai mẹ con rất thân thiết với nhau. Nhưng bắt đầu lên đầu C2 mẹ của em ấy có những hành vì động chạm vào những chỗ em ấy không thích trên cơ thể với tần suất rất thường xuyên, em ấy nhiều lần tỏ ra khó chịu thâm chí là vô tình đáp trả khi mẹ em ấy có những hành vi đó, nhưng đề bị mẹ em ấy cho ăn đòn thậm chí là chửi mắng thậm tệ. Mẹ em ấy kêu rằng em ấy k thương mẹ nên mới làm như vậy. Mình lần đầu mới nghe trường hợp này, không biết m.ng nghĩ sao ?

                              <span>Hello friendly people, 
 I am visiting your country for the first time with my dad from Armenia, we wanted to explore asia for the first time and my father being a typical anti imperialist leftist he adores Vietnam, I&#x27;m sure you already know your nation has a huge fanbase consisting of boomer leftists. 
 To my question(s): We&#x27;re landing in Hanoi and leaving from Ho Chi Minh City and want to take the train to see the beautiful countryside. We&#x27;re staying from 30th Jan-12th February, coincidentally during Tet Holiday. 
  
Is there a reliable website to buy train tickets in advance?
 Do the train stop at some cities so you can go outside and explore it during a short time between stops?
 Is it worth buying train tickets ASAP since it&#x27;s Tet holiday soon?
 We&#x27;re thinking of either staying in Hoi An one night and continuing the next day, is this something you would recommend or is going straight to HCMC?
  
Thank you and looking forward to visiting your country! 
 Bonus question:
  
Is it offensive if I wear those green short sleeved shirts older Vietnamese men wear as a mediterranean looking guy? I always wanted to rock those shirts and want to fit in/be accepted by Vietnamese people.

                              <span>I loved HCMC and expected to love Hanoi. It’s my first day here and I never want to come back. It’s horrible, it’s dirty, it smells so bad, there’s trash and rubble everywhere and I was not ready to see that much dog meat in the street. I tried walking around diferente areas in the city to see if maybe something changed but it’s all bad. I’ll go to the HCM Mausoleum tomorrow and see if that’s any better but honestly I just want to cry and leave. 
 I’m from Guatemala City and that’s a pretty ugly city + crime is bad and it’s still better than Hanoi in my opinion. Where should I go? I want to give this city a chance.

                              <span>I have been warned a lot of times about not to carry stuff from strangers/acquaintance/friends/anyone on the airplane, because the stuff may contain harmful drug ingredients. If you get caught in certain countries you may even get death penalty. Some of them go as far as using mind control to make you feel bad if you refuse to do their favor, such as using seniors, disabled people, and orphans as a disguise to ask you to carry stuff on their behalf. In my unpopular opinion, scapegoat seekers (i.e. retards that ask someone to do their dirty jobs while reaping benefits behind the scene) are the WORST HUMANS, COWARDICE ON EARTH, second only to leeches (i.e. people that can read the mood but their skin is so thick that they still cross the line). These kind of “special breeds of people” can be found anywhere in the world, from all backgrounds, ethnic groups, so whoever thinks your background/ethnicity is at play here is FAR WORSE than those aforementioned special breeds.

                              <span>I am a white guy solo traveling in Vietnam. I am currently in Hai Phong. Yesterday some guys invited me to join their table for drinking and eating. They handed me beer, food, rice wine, etc. We kept drinking for quite some time. There was also a bit of weed which they offered me and that I smoked.
 Eventually we go a bit further away, they said to listen to some music. We arrive at some small shop but there is no music. After that I say I am going home and I don&#x27;t need help going home, I can walk. One of the guys insists I go with him on the scooter. Despite the language barrier, I understand it as if he will now drive me home, so I go with him. Instead we drive for a bit with me barely getting closer to my home and we get off at the center square of the city. We talk for a bit and I say I am walking home now, they suggest I take one of the nearby taxis. It feels a bit sketchy for me so I do not take a taxi and I tell the guys I will walk home. I start walking and with an uneasy feeling. There are not many people out at this time. I order a Grab and it arrives quite quick, then I eventually get back to my hotel safely.
 I am not sure what to think of this whole meeting. It should also be mentioned that I did not see anyone paying for the bill at the restaurant, and I got the impression that I was sort of expected to pay for it, since at one time the bill was placed in front of me. I never paid though.
 What do you think? Was I at risk of something happening?

                              <span>I will be traveling Vietnam for a month in March, not sure which city to visit first. I can purchase a multi-city ticket that arrives and departs from either of them for almost the same price as if I did it from the same city. Which part of Vietnam would be better in the beginning of March weather/vibe/events wise? I will spend there maybe a week and move on to the Da Nang area, visit some places in between, then arrive at the other city around a week before departure.

                              <span>About a friend of mine. Her and her sister have the same first name H**** but have different middle names. They’re always called by their middle name then first name when around their relatives. 
 She said she asked her mom “why?” but her mom never gave her a real answer. Q. Why do we have the same first name? A. Mom “I just like the name.”
 Q. Is this common? A. Her mom would just ask.
 She never really questioned it growing up nor did any of her relative brought it up. But I was over at her house and notice it and asked her. Me and my friend tried searching it up on online but haven’t had much luck in this subject.
 Any experts that can chime in with your knowledge is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Today I was in Saigon - Thao Dien, there was a women being pushed into a taxi, the man forcefully holding her down so she couldn’t escape as well as locking the doors. She was fighting, kicking and crying. Everyone just looked, it was a crowded street, the taxi drove of. I ran after it after a bit of hesitation, luckily there was oncoming traffic so I was able to catch up to the car. I opened the taxi drivers front door and told him to let the women out. He tried unlocking the door but the man locked the door always from inside and yelled at the driver to drive away. Finally I was able to open the door, the women sadly just ran away, I tried to keep the dude contained by holding the door, but he pushed the door open, punched me and then ran after the women. After I got my footing back I ran after them, but I wasn’t able to locate them by foot. I tried asking expats to follow them on the bike but no one wanted to.. so I sprinted to the police in Thao dien, who also seemed disinterested… I don’t know how to feel.

                              <span>Hello everyone! I’m travelling with friends to Vietnam later this January and we’ll be doing the Ha Giang Loop.
 Looking for some information, I came across this beautiful image of somewhere in the north region of Vietnam, touching China. According to the photographer’s caption on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/p/Cwu_Wd6oIUV/?igsh&#x3D;MWMycGgzZWh1bHVjeQ&#x3D;&#x3D;), the mountains at the end of the image are China, and this little river and valley is Vietnam (the northern part).
 Can anyone identify where exactly it is? We’d love to see this in person but the photographer doesn’t respond our messages…
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>My partner and I went hiking through the nattional park near ninh Binh today. When we returned, we discovered several bleeding spots around our ankles in areas that were covered by our socks. These spots were clustered in groups and continued to bleed for a long time. What caused these? Thanks.

                              <span>Chào mn ạ, Hiện tại em rất rất cần người soi đường dẫn lối cho em, e tha thiết xin lời khuyên từ đàn anh đàn chị ạ. Em hiện là sv năm 4, cbi ra trường của một trường khá có tiếng về ngoại ngữ ở hcm. Chuyên ngành của e thì lại k có tính áp dụng cao (thiên về chính trị), đa số quá trình học chủ yếu là chạy dl trên lý thuyết... Nên bây giờ gần ra trường nhưng em lại rất sợ vì không có chuyên môn. Sơ lược thì hiện tại em có Toeic 800+, Vstep B2, em đang có mục tiêu học Tiếng trung và trước khi tốt nghiệp có HSK3. Tuy nhiên, em không biết em phải đi theo con đường gì với những gì e đang có. Đa số bạn em theo Hr, e hướng nội + nhát gan k biết có nên theo không. Em cũng có định hướng theo logistic, và đang có ý định tìm job intern về những mảng này, nhưng chuyên môn em không có gì, ngành học k liên quan nên đa số k ai nhận. Các a chị cho e lời khuyên về con đường e nên theo với những thứ e đang có với ạ. Thời gian này em tiêu cực lắm, đôi khi e còn nghĩ về việc tồi tệ nhất... Nhà e cũng k khá giả, bame mắc nợ nhiều nên e k muốn bị thất nghiệp sau ra trường đâu ạ. Em hi vọng có người chỉ lối cho em vài tháng trước khi em tốt nghiệp ạ. Vài tháng này có thể sẽ thay đổi số phận 1 người được đó ạ 🥺. E bế tắc lắm, e mong có thể có 1 mentor cứu e về tương lai lẫn tinh thần hiện tại...

                              <span>Hi everyone, first ever time posting on reddit and found this community really helpful so far. 
 I am going to Vietnam 20th Jan-9th February with a friend and just wondered if you can drop any tips/advice or anything that might be helpful for first time long distance travellers from the UK! 
 I have tried to work out the travel situation (grab seems good?) and it appears cash is preferred option but also have access to credit card when there. 
 We have booked accommodation in the following areas : Hanoi, halong bay, cat ba national park, nin binh and day trip to cu national park and then back to Hanoi before travelling home. 
 So any places to go/things not to miss and general tips would be so appreciated.

                              <span>My partner and I (Australian) are currently staying at a lovely little Airbnb in Hoi An which is looked after by a delightful young family (as employees). The family has invited us to dinner for the second time. 
 The first meal was amazing and she obviously put in a lot of effort. I’d really like to bring something as a show of appreciation. 
 I was thinking a dessert from a shop in town, or maybe some gifts for their young 8 and 3 year old daughters. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks 🙏

                              <span>My dad who is now a viet kieu had brought a house years ago in Vietnam for his father and brother to live in. He had to change the ownership to his father since Vietnam doesn&#x27;t allow viet kieu to own properties in the country. Unfortunately, a a few years after the dad passed away, the next person to have their name on the property is his brother and the brother promised my dad that he will give the house back to him later on when the time is right even though they didn&#x27;t sign any contract because my dad naively believed in him. His brother is now dead and the ownership goes to his wife. My dad expected his sister in law to then rightfully transfer the ownership to him or even half of the house because the sister in law did help the family a lot while my dad was overseas, but she retorted back saying that my dad did not care about the family at all and had contributed nothing so he does not deserve any part of the house. We are going to sue her because we have the papers that prove that my dad did contribute a lot to that house and even my late grandpa acknowledged that in one of his old letters to my dad. The house in question is currently for rent as a business. My dad and I found a lawyer through connections and he said to stop my auntie from potentially selling it later, we must first block her from doing that by depositing 20% value of the house to the funds before the court trial since that&#x27;s how the law works. Is that correct? I&#x27;m trying to find a new lawyer cause I don&#x27;t trust this one and I see him as really incompetent. Pls tell me what I should do next.....

 Arriving 30th Jan, Leaving 13th Feb, flying into Hà Nội. We have a hotel for the first three days, and the plan is by that time to have decided on a next destination, somewhere relatively rural and authentic. We have been planning this for a while (2 Males, early 20s, one English one Aussie), but somehow we managed to miss just how extensive and important Tet is as a holiday, and we feel we may have messed up. Neither of us are able / want to rent bikes, and we have no idea what the transportation situation would loo…</span>

We came back later in the evening and noticed they wrote us a note back. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t translate with my phone. If anyone could help us translate that would be awesome! Thank you!

 We have been going round Vietnam for a week and are experiencing that people all over are coughing and sniffing. Waiters, tourists, pedestrians. We ourselves are all experiencing it and at risk of chest/ throat infections at this stage.

I went back to look for it today and found a note taped to the machine!! Someone found it and left it at their hotel front desk, and I was able to get it back when I showed my ID. One thousand thanks. I hope they see this, and that they have good luck for their whole life.

                              <span>Hello! 
 I am visiting for a couple of weeks and wanted to bring my straightening iron from my home country. I will be using an adaptor but am uncertain about the voltage. The iron says 120-240V 50/60Hz
 Will I be able to use this iron with an adaptor when I arrive? Or would the device get fried. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 When I got a chance to travel to SE Asia (once every 4 to 6 years only), I was always buying polos from &#x27;Ralph Lauren&#x27; or &#x27;Lacoste&#x27; on Thailand markets. If you can select the right models and ~haggle well enough you can have good deals.
 Now I&#x27;ll go to Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City / Hanoi) and Laos (Luang Prabang) and would be happy to have your opinion about it. Where to buy? Can you find good quality? Are prices OK?
 Thank you in advance for any &#x27;tip&#x27; or information.

                              <span>there’s an “asian american” accent i’ve heard people talking about, and i’ve always wondered about it. i don’t really know what it is, it’s not really an “accent”, but more an inflection or a manner of speaking that makes you instantly identify the speaker as having an asian background even though you can also tell they’re a native english speaker. even some of my friends who had english as a first language still have traces of this accent.
 i was born and raised in the US but i have a somewhat noticeable accent, cause my parents immigrated shortly before i was born and only spoke viet at home. tbh i’m grateful i don’t just know englsih and can speak viet (not fluently but conversationally) but sometimes it’s hard to speak english after a while living back with my parents lmao. for example some of my vowels and consonants sound viet. words like “cold” i might accidentally pronounced as “code” and “social” as “so sho”, “your” comes out as “yer.” it’s weird when i tell ppl about this bc they’re like “uhhhh weren’t you born in orange county…?” and i’m like “yeah lmao but my english still isn’t great🧐” i still speak english fluently but often it’s hard to express myself fully (without pausing) and pronouncing words that have sounds which don’t exist in VN 
 does anyone else have this “accent”? how do you make it less noticeable?

                              <span>mình nữ hơn 30 tuổi rồi, chưa lập gđ, lông bông trong công việc. Chán nản mọi thứ. Ko kết nối với ai ngoài đời, trên mạng, sống kiểu chảnh cho không muốn giao tiếp vậy. Kiểu t thích một mình. Để t yên đừng có làm phiền. Mình sống tâm lý chán nản ko có động lực trầm cảm lâu rồi, mỗi ngày chỉ ăn ngủ xem phim nghe nhạc chơi game, không làm đc gì kiếm ra tiền, đi làm ở ngoài xh thì mình sợ tiếp xúc nên trốn ở nhà. Rồi ảo tưởng làm idol top top mxh kiếm tiền, nhưng mãi ko thực hiện, đã thử nhưng mình dễ bị nản rồi bỏ dở ko hoạt động. Kiểu mình làm gì cũng chán. Chỉ thích mấy cái tiêu khiển giải trí nghe nhạc xem phim chơi game qua ngày. Đã ngồi vào bàn làm cái gì đó hay để vạch ra kế hoạch tương lai nhưng vẫn là chán. Mình yếu kém, ko có năng lực ko làm đc tích sự gì, kĩ năng giao tiếp kém, mình muốn thay đổi để ko bị coi thường chứ nhưng tinh thần mình trước ngoại cảnh mình hay bị yếu đuối nên kéo theo việc ngáo ngơ dễ bị đánh giá, nên mình tránh tiếp xúc con người.
 Năm mới vẫn vô tích sự như vậy. Mình cảm thấy mình ko theo cái quy luật của cuộc sống đc, ko làm theo những gì người ta vẫn làm theo khuôn khổ.

And i thought I had plenty of time to spend and travel from hcmc all the way up to sapa and ha giang… but the more i search, more i reliase that i don’t have enough time for all. 
 For now my itinerary looks like this
 Feb 4,5,6 Hcmc
 Ride a overnight train to danang 
 Feb 7 One night in hoi an Feb 8 One night in danang
 morning Flight to hanoi then bus to ninh binh 
 Feb 9,10,11 Two nights in ninh binh
 Return to hanoi, halong bay or cat ba cruise
 Feb 12,13 overnight cruise
 Return to hanoi then night train to sapa
 Feb 14,15,16 two nights in sapa
 Bus to ha giang
 Feb 17,18,19,20 Three nights in ha giang
 Return early to hanoi feb20
 Chill at hanoi feb 21
 Am i putting myself into too much things to do? Tbh if i had known theres not much to enjoy in south i wouldve flown to danang as im more interested in nature and sightseeing. But since i have already booked my ticket and its quite pricy to change it… what could be the best option for now?

                              <span>Happy New Year everyone. Hope your New Year has been good. Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t been good for me at all.
 ​
 I&#x27;m currently in the US for university, forced by my mother to go here. Despite my efforts to convince her that I hate the US, she still signed me up for SAT tutoring, and SAT exam, and also applied to the school I am currently studying at, with the help of a language center. 
 ​
 I have tried to convince her saying I do not want to go to the US, but she doesn&#x27;t care. She is convinced that it is good for me, and even more so since my older brother is also there, who went to and graduated from the same university.
 ​
 I moved here right after finishing high school a few months ago. So now I am here in the US, Alabama (terrible state I know, I was forced to, it was not my choice).…</span>

                              <span>I have a classs A motorbike licence in the UK and thought I would be able to use it in Vietnam to drive legally. After some research this seems to be incorrect? What&#x27;s the relevance of an IDP. I contacted a motorbike company in HCMC and after telling me any bike I bought would be confiscated he is no longer replying.
 Thanks

Checked online for advice and read that you cannot get USD for Dong anywhere in ha tien, as in banks will not exchange money for different currencies. How do we get dollar? I dont want to travel all the way there to be turned away because we dont have dollars in cash. Any advice is appreciated

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 5 months since I set my foot on the US and every day is a living hell to me. I have never really wanted to settle and study here but now it is like I was forced to live like this for possibly years before becoming on my own. It&#x27;s not America per se that is the problem, but the circumstance under which I got here. TL;DR at the end of this Ted talk. 
 To start with, my family really wanted us to study abroad and hopefully move to the US as I grow up, considering my other relatives already living there. Tbh, I had no interest in going to the US to &quot;seek opportunity&quot; and I surmised life would be depressing to me, at least. So I continued minding my own business in high school: making friends, getting grades, dating. In 10th grade, the concern of studying abroad rose to me, but I was …</span>

I have celebrated the Lunar New Year with him/his family for the past 3 years, and there&#x27;s a Tết festival we will be attending this year. I would really love to get an ao dai and wear it to the festival- I&#x27;ve only ever worn normal clothes. I think they&#x27;re beautiful and since I plan on marrying my boyfriend I would like to embrace his culture as much as I can. I&#x27;m honestly a little shy to ask him about wearing one, he was born here and is pretty Americanized so I&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s weird if I asked.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve already bought robusta and arabica beans to take home. Seller said arabica is new and robusta is the real vietnam coffee? Didn&#x27;t look much on the brand or if it&#x27;s single origin. 
 Also looking for this weasel and mountain coffee. Is it worth it or just hype? Where to buy them that&#x27;s not in exorbitant prices. I once bought hazelnut roasted beans (not in Vietnam) that smelled so good but was rather bland or weak in taste. Somewhat they took the coffee taste away but infused the smell.
 The coffee flavors here are sweet like those instant 3 in 1. The saigon, egg and salted coffee were the least of my favorites. Coconut coffee is...yeah unique i like the most.

                              <span>I’m Vietnamese-American and was visiting Hanoi for a week. I’ve played pickup basketball in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and saw there were a few nice outdoor courts in HN that I wanted to try out. 
 My experience below was pretty ass. Are there any public pickup spots for basketball in Hanoi? Would love to meet up for some games next year when I’m there. 
 -Sân Bóng Rổ HK Sport: Came at 6pm on a Friday. No entrance fee but zero people at the basketball court. It looked nice though, I left immediately. -Sân Bóng Rổ CLB Ba Đình: Came at 5pm on Friday. Security at the facility main gate said they are fixing the court and it’s closed. Not sure I even went to the right place though. -The New Quarter (612 Đ. Hoàng Hoa Thám, Bưởi, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam): Arrived 6:30pm on Friday. Nice one and half courts. About 25 people mostly teenagers shooting around. A group seemed to have reserved the full court for a party without playing any games. I shot around for an hour before asking to start playing 3’s. After the game ended, some guys said their friends showed up and started their own games.

                              <span>Our hostel warden gave us the worst possible experience just now. We have a booking for 4 of us and we had a friend drop by to our private room to use washroom facilities. The warden threw a hissy fit and started yelling and raising hell and gave us a very rough time. Plus, there was no way to properly explain to him that it was just a friend dropping by a bit, and not an escort - since he doesn’t understand english. 
 He harasses us further by locking us in and not letting our friend out for about an hour. He then threatened to report us to police and demanded money to the tune of 30 million dong (which he said was to pay the cops). He also refused to get us the manager. We are all very shaken by this experience, and are quite convinced it wasn’t lawful at all. After he realised that he wasn’t getting a penny out of us, he calmed down after a bit and opened the shutters.
 What can we do about it?
 P.S: We’re in HCMC, and booked the hostel via Hostelworld.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I’m planning to visit Vietnam in January/February for a bit more than 3 weeks.
 I will arrive in Hanoi and will return from HCMC.
 The idea was to explore the northern part of Vietnam and to do Hi Giang loop, but I understand that it is not recommend due to bad weather ?
 It’s surprising because I have found many website telling that the weather would be cold and dry.
 Any opinions?
 Many thanks !!

                              <span>Hello,
 As many westerns who love to explore eating, I absolutely fell in love with the Bahn Mi; especially Vietnamese Ham (Cha Lua) which I just adore so much I want to make my own. My biggest worry with creating this delectable meat is botulism. I would like to follow the recipe bellow and have all of the ingredients and equipment to do so:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jrXqvP7y0WM
 Is there any risks of botulism by using this method?
 If you make a really big batch can you vacuum pack the rest and store in the freezer? Any botulism or food risk there?
 I really would like to explore this but it is very new for me and I want to be as safe as possible.
 Thank you very much for time.
 Kevin

                              <span>Basically the title.
 As an Indian, I visited Vietnam recently and I noticed that cab drivers, hotel managers, tour guides, or the people in general whom I met welcomed me and showed positive gesture towards me. During my trip, I visited only famous places which are often visited by any tourist. But, I want to understand the sentiment of any Vietnamese towards Indians who not necessarily reside in those cities.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 38M from the US who&#x27;s been living in Vietnam (Saigon) the last couple of months. Last month I&#x27;ve matched with a woman (32F) on Tinder who lives in Tra Vinh. She&#x27;s a university professor and says that she&#x27;s unconventional for her environment (isn&#x27;t looking for marriage and having kids). We&#x27;ve had a couple of video calls and she seems genuine and honest. 
 So she invited me to visit her at her home for a couple of days. Given that I&#x27;m a foreigner in this country it makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable especially because I&#x27;ve never received such an invitation before.
 Am I going to be abducted or am I being a bit paranoid? Anything I should be worried about?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an American living and working in Hanoi. I&#x27;m trying to become more educated on Vietnamese table manners. This topic has been frustrating to me. My Vietnamese girlfriend and my Vietnamese friends have commented on some of my bad table manners. It&#x27;s been difficult for me to try and change my eating habits. 
 Here are some of the things I experienced:
  
Vietnamese share their meals. My girlfriend told me that I should share food so I don&#x27;t appear selfish. Usually in the US, my friends and I would just share an appetizer and then I would just eat the dish I ordered. I also had difficulty adjusting to this because I was concerned with hygiene. 
 Vietnamese aren&#x27;t so finicky with hygiene. My friends share food using the same chopsticks they eat with, and when I have beer with friends they handle the ice cubes with their hands. Surprising at first, but I don&#x27;t make a fuss about it.
 I shouldn&#x27;t accept food using my chopsticks when someone is offering food with their chopsticks. I just did this once, and people told me I shouldn&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;m not sure why it is rude though. 
 I shouldn&#x27;t eat fast. My girlfriend told me it looks bad. I guess I eat fast, but for me it&#x27;s my normal pace. I didn&#x27;t have long lunch breaks in school/work in the US, so I guess that&#x27;s why.
 I have to let old people eat first. I usually don&#x27;t eat with older people, but I was told about this. I had food with a friend&#x27;s family, and I didn&#x27;t eat until her grandparents started eating. 
  
I read a few more online, but I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s true. For example, it&#x27;s unlucky to flip a whole fish when eating. I have a Chinese uncle who that told me about that, but my girlfriend never heard of it.
 I hope I can receive some feedback and tips on improving my table manners.

                              <span>Em hiện giờ đang học lớp 12. Từ khi lên cấp 3 em quyết định đi du học nên em hoàn toàn chăm chú thực hiện mục đích đó thôi - đến trên lớp em cũng chỉ cày điểm ngang mức yêu cầu của bên trường đh đó, còn từ khi lên 12 thì em gần như bỏ hết mấy môn không cần thiết mà chỉ tập trung một vài môn yêu cầu thôi. Thế nhưng mới 2 tuần trước mẹ em lại bị diagnosed with ung thư tử cung giai đoạn cuối ạ. Gia đình em ngoài mẹ ra thì chỉ có nguồn thu nhập là ba em - là giáo viên nên lương ba cũng ko cao. Em thì vẫn ưu tiên việc chữa trị của mẹ nên việc du học ko thực hiện được thì vẫn ok. Nhưng về ngành mà em muốn học (Thiết kế đồ hoạ), thì cả gia đình em đều phản đối nếu học ở Việt Nam í, vì ngành đó ko phát triển ở đây. Ngoài ngành đó ra thì em thực sự không muốn hay đam mê học ngành nào khác. Em cũng chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến việc học ở Việt Nam... Nhưng rồi em cũng chỉ còn 5 tháng nữa để tốt nghiệp thôi ạ, nên cần quyết định càng sớm càng tốt i. 
 Theo mn nghĩ thì em nên take gap year không ạ? Em ko quan tâm đến việc thụt lùi so với mấy bạn đồng lứa hay opinion mấy người xung quanh đâu, chỉ cần là hướng đi tốt thì em sẽ cân nhắc ạ.

                              <span>I’ve been studying Vietnamese for about a month now and I’ve acquired some sentences and words. However, I did notice that there’s two dialects/accents to Vietnamese. When I look on TikTok I always see southern Vietnamese people talking about how the northern accent is complicated and sometimes hard to understand. But at the same time, most Vietnamese songs are written in the northern dialect and most apps only teach the Northern dialect. As a person who lives in the United States, I’ve seen sources state that most Vietnamese Americans speak with the southern dialect. Obviously I would want to make learning Vietnamese as easy as possible by learning the most commonly used dialect or easiest dialect to learn and understand. So this leads me to my question, should I learn the northern or southern dialect?

                              <span>Hello everyone! Planning a two-week trip has proven more challenging than I anticipated, given the overwhelming amount of information available online.
 After extensive research, I&#x27;ve crafted the following itinerary for my travels during the first two weeks of March 2024. I would greatly appreciate your feedback on it, please! 😊 I hope I&#x27;m not missing something amazing.
 I know it&#x27;s impossible to see everything in 13 days, but I&#x27;d like to visit all the best spots, from North to South.
 Day 1 and 2: Hanoi
 Day 3 and 4: Mai Chau
 Day 5 and 6: Halong Bay
 Day 7: Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park
 Day 8: Da Nang
 Day 9 and 10: Hoi An
 Day 11 and 12: Ho Chi Minh
 Day 13: Travel back to home country
 Thanks!

 Can some of you affirm/deny that cocoa powder is / isn&#x27;t infact available in VN?

                              <span>Hi everyone, need some advice for an upcoming trip. I unfortunately will only be in Vietnam for 7 days and am trying to determine if I should change my itinerary as I think it might be too packed.
 My current plan is 2 nights in Saigon (XO Food Tour on motorbike, Cu Chi Tunnels, Mekong Delta), 2 nights in Hoi An (bike tour, basket boats, etc.), and 3 nights in Hanoi (possibly with a trip to Ha Long Bay). I will be flying between all of these.
 Am I doing too much? Should I cut one of these out of my trip and extend time in the other two places?

I have been experiencing certain symptoms that my family calls it &quot;Weird&quot;, as I kept talking to myself, imagining characters and scenarios,twitching my arms or legs, that kinds of stuff. I&#x27;m genuinely asking, are there any ways for me to get an official diagnostics for my disorders?

 Which providers can you recommend and how can I find a good provider who will give us a nice tour?

                              <span>So I’m a native Vietnamese, born and raised. Left Vietnam 7 years ago to move abroad and haven’t returned since.
 I’m coming back to stay for a year and haven’t been keeping up with the changes in Vietnam. After quite a bit of researching, found surprising amounts of innovations and quality of life changes.
 For example: 
 Grab now offers food/packages/personal items delivery.
 Online transactions are a lot more prominent now than before and of course the growth of massive commerce space like Lazada and shopee
 Paying with virtual wallet is a thing
 My general question is,
 What major quality of life changes have happened the past 7 years?

                              <span>I’ve been getting into Vietnamese music lately and trying to get my wife into it. She doesn’t like any of the Viet rappers because it’s almost always slow rap. Can you guys recommend any good rappers that sound “hard?” Or anyone that raps like BTS. She’s a big fan of theirs.

                              <span>I’m an ethnic Korean that just learned about the horrible things Korea did in Vietnam.
 I’m sorry.
 List of things I learned about today:
 Koreans raping Vietnamese women:

 Ostracized children of rape:

 Examples of Korean-led massacre of Vietnamese civilians:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A0_My_massacre
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_Nh%E1%BB%8B_and_Phong_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_massacre

 If we want any apology or recognition from Japan we must first acknowledge and apologize for this stain on our nation’s soul.
 I’m just kind of in abject horror right now that it took me so long to learn about this.
 I’m sorry.

                              <span>Hello! On January 10th, I&#x27;m embarking on a 21-day road trip in Vietnam. Starting in Hanoi, I plan to head to Yen Bai in the north early the next day for a 2-day visit before continuing. This region isn&#x27;t often included in travelers&#x27; itineraries—do you think it&#x27;s worthwhile in January? Any city or route recommendations for January would be greatly appreciated! Thank you ☺️

                              <span>I’m about to be a father. I’m a Vietnamese that was born in US and adopted by Americans. I returned back to my family when i turned 18. I did the best i can to restore our Vietnamese roots. I’m a buddhist also. I noticed most Vietnamese daughters usually get a Jade Buddha with gold chain necklace pendant. If i have a daughter i would also. My question is. What do i give my son? Would they usually get the same jade buddha necklace also or do they get a jade dragon pendant? Would love to know y’all input. Also my soon to be wife is a Filipina.

 I will be traveling to HCMC in February for 4 weeks. This is my once in a lifetime dream trip and I really want to get the most out of it but I think my itinerary wishlist has grown a little out of control... I&#x27;m hoping people will have input on places to spend 1-2 days (or just skip completely?)
 At a minimum, I&#x27;m hoping to go to: HCMC (both for Tết and for arrival/departure) Phú Quốc Đà Nẵng Huế A cruise at Vịnh Hạ Long, Vịnh Bái Tử Long, or Vịnh Lan Hạ
 The plan is to spend maybe 1 day in Hà Nội
 The nice-to-haves: Cần Thơ, Hội An, Ninh Bình, and Cam Ranh.
 I went for 2 weeks before and was able to visit HCMC, Đà Lạt, Nha Trang, and Vũng Tàu and didn&#x27;t feel it was too much but I think I&#x27;m over the limit this time.
 Sorry... that&#x27;s a lot of info but if anyone has opinions, I would love to hear them! :) Cảm ơn nhiều

                              <span>Tuy đã 30 tuổi nhưng mình hoàn toàn không có ý niệm gì về việc chơi đề ở các quán nước hoạt động như nào. Chỉ suốt ngày nghe đến các câu “đánh đề” hay “đề về” như những câu cửa miệng, chuyện dân gian. Nhưng hôm nay bỗng nổi hứng học hỏi muốn tìm hiểu.
 Mình hiểu qua cách chơi đề, bạn ra quán nước chọn một con số rồi chờ cuối ngày đề về. Nếu trùng số thì 1 ăn 70 hay 80 gì đó.
 Nhưng ai là nhà cái, có phải các chủ quán nước tự quản không hay họ có “cấp trên” là nhà cái tổng? Nếu có nhà cái tổng thì các quán nước cấp dưới của họ thu lợi nhuận như thế nào?
 Có hệ thống phân cấp rạch ròi như kiểu một công ty hay Giáo hội không? Các nhà cái có nhà cái cấp trên và cứ thế đi lên tới một ông sếp cuối cùng? Nếu có thì ông này là ai và làm thế nào để ngoi lên được chức đó? Nếu không thì các nhà cái hoạt động như những đơn vị độc lập có cạnh tranh trực tiếp với nhau không và như nào? Họ có tranh giành địa bàn, cạnh tranh tỉ lệ thắng, thâu tóm khách hàng?
 Vai trò của công an trong hệ thống chơi đề như thế nào?

                              <span>Mình có nói chuyện với 1 bạn nữ , cũng được 1 thời gian rồi , nói chuyện cũng khá ổn áp . Nhà hai đứa cũng gần nhau , nên bạn có chủ động hẹn khi nào mình đi ăn vs nhau nha . Nhưng mà không biết khi nào là khi nào :)))) nên mình cứ hay nhắn tin hỏi bạn khi nào rảnh . Bạn vẫn chưa trả lời mình , nhưng có một ngày bạn đi với công ty thì có nhờ mình lên rước về dùm , lúc đó cũng khá khuya 11h hơn rồi nên mình cũng không muốn rủ bạn đi ăn hay gì nữa . Từ lúc đó mình có tiếp tục nhắn tin , điều khó hiểu nhất là bạn đó đổi cái sticker thành trái tim trong khung chat . Nhưng hẹn đi ăn tới giờ vẫn chưa được . Vì lí do bệnh , bạn có nói hết bệnh sẽ kêu mình ... mà hôm qua lại thấy bạn đó đi vs cty .. Cgai khó hiểu thật

                              <span>I&#x27;d appreciate any advice. I&#x27;m wondering if it would be cheaper to book flights within Vietnam (hanoi to HCMC) FROM Vietnam, when I&#x27;m there? As opposed to buying here online from US? Google flights shows flight from hanoi to HCMC for $600usd. If I wait and purchase online from Vietnamese airlines, will I be cheaper? What about once I&#x27;ve arrived and seeing a travel agency for this? Thank you!

                              <span>Hey all,
 ​
 My mates (foreigners) and my gf (Vietnamese) will tour Vietnam in February while she is visiting home for Tet.
 I am planning for an itinerary for Ha Long where I will arrive on the evening of 5th Feb and leave for Hanoi on the 8th of Feb in the early afternoon giving us a full day (7 Feb to plan day activities).
 We have an accommodation planned in Ha Long city for the days. Can anyone suggest if there can be some alternatives to cruise trips for the days that we are there? I have heard about some tours in Cat ba island but not sure how to choose them yet.
 I am looking to find alternatives to the Ha Long cruise for a few reasons - 
 - My gf thinks it&#x27;s dangerous and she doesn&#x27;t want to go on an overnight cruise because she is just visiting there for photos(?)
 - Cruise may be a bit expensive for some of us. I am finding people suggesting against cheaper tours and so may have to look at something atleast upwards of $200 USD for an overnight tour.
 ​
 I am happy to receive any counterarguments and maybe I can convince my gf if there are some suggestions to go for it. 
 Would anyone be able to suggest some tours or any day activities that can get us most of Ha Long/Cat Ba for the duration we are there?
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

Khoảng thời gian trước đó, em thích bạn và bạn đó cũng biết nhưng chỉ muốn làm bạn với em thôi. Sau này, bạn tặng em rất nhiều đồ handmade, skinship hay tựa vào em và còn tặng quà giá trị bất ngờ cho em. Nhưng mỗi khi em đề cập lại chuyện em thích bạn thì bạn lảnh tránh xa việc khác. Thật sự khó ấy mn!!!

                              <span>I plan on being in Ho Chi Minh City during the Super Bowl. Feb 11th, 7am Local time. I realize that Tet (Lunar New Year) is that this time.
 I am a massive NFL fan and would hate to miss the big game. Would I have any options to watch? I would be willing to rent a property with a TV if there a reliable way to stream. Curious is anyone has any experience watching American football in South East Asia. Thanks.

Mình khuyên mẹ tiền mẹ vất vả kiếm được, mẹ tiêu theo ý mẹ, mẹ mua gì phải theo ý thích của mẹ, đừng để chị ấy chỉ đạo, điều khiển, thao túng mẹ rồi mẹ phải chi tiền, trả tiền, thiệt mẹ thôi, còn chị ấy không mất đồng nào. Có những món đồ hàng về mở ra không dùng được lại phí tiền. Còn những đứa con khác tự mua đồ trong gia đình bằng tiền của bản thân chứ có phải đặt theo ý của bả rồi bắt mẹ trả tiền vậy đâu. Bạn nghĩ sao về trường hợp này? nói thế nào cho mẹ hiểu?

                              <span>Out walking and came upon this lady outside Coffee 31. The line and delivery pickups was crazy. We ordered one based on the line alone and then asked someone else nearby with one what it was. They gave us the name of the dish, xoi xeo, but other than sticky rice and crispy onion, we&#x27;re not sure exactly what all was on it. I only wish we&#x27;d found this earlier because it was quite possibly one of the best things I&#x27;ve had in a long time. Online search wasn&#x27;t helpful and gave variations, I&#x27;m curious what&#x27;s on this one...

                              <span>So I’m currently in Vietnam and I’m starting to realize my preferences. I’m going to break down the cities I like and the cities I don’t like with the hope that people could help give me insight to where I would like to go in the future as I spend 2-3 more weeks here going south. 
 Like: Hanoi, Ha Giang, Ninh Binh, Da Nang
 Dislike: Halong Bay, Hoi An, Sa Pa
 I was thinking of going to Nha Trang, Mu Nue, Dalat, Saigon, and potentially Phu Quoc. 
 I reeeeealy don’t like cities that feel overly touristy and of my three dislikes, they all did to me. Still have some nice things to offer but just not where I feel like being. 
 Any suggestions on my future itinerary in terms of places to add or remove based on my preferences? I am comfortable on a motorbike so that should be considered.

                              <span>I visited Vietnam this earlier this month and just came back recently. I never knew I would like visiting Vietnam that much! 
 I never thought I would want to visit Vietnam again, but now I want to visit every year or every other year if possible. I really enjoyed the food and the shopping, but wasn’t a big fan of the weather (I prefer cold and foggy weather). 
 Maybe it’s because I was always comparing to U.S. prices, but everything was very cheap/affordable. Where I live, it’s easily $17-20 for a bowl of pho or bun bo hue. I ordered 3 bowls of bun bo hue off grab and it was only 160k (the portion sizes are smaller but even if I ate all 3 myself, that’s only about $6.50?) 
 I did a lot of searching on this reddit to see where I should get my hair cut done at. I ended up going to Hair Bar in district 1 - for females, it was 580k for shampoo+mini massage, hair cut, and styling (480k if you want a quick shampoo). I’m sure there are cheaper places, but I wanted to try and get the best if possible. I recommended my sister in law to go there as well, she also enjoyed it.
 For a full body massage, facial, and hair wash, I went to Yushi Clinic Beauty &amp; Spa in district 3 and it was about 840k for a wonderful experience - it was about 2.5 hrs long. It could have been cheaper, but I asked for some add-ons such as the facial and a scalp treatment. 
 For clothes shopping, some of the shops I enjoyed were: Uniqlo SC Studios ($30-110/item ; lots of linen &amp; silk) Rosie ($12-30 for most items, $40-50 for coats) Libe ($12-30/item) Dear Jose ($80+ dresses) Secondee Flanh
 I visited Aufra &amp; Len Clothing as well which had some nice styles, but the quality wasn’t as nice as say, Libe or Rosie, for the same cost. 
 My favorites were SC Studios and Rosie

                              <span>Arrived in Danang 2 days ago. Today I went for haircut and while I was waiting a went to grab a bahn my and there was a bunch of dudes sitting and drinking. One older guy said hello and wanted to shake my hand so I was like okay shook his hand he looked drunk and then after shaking my hand he grabbed my junk and squeezed it I immediately pulled away and turned my back on him and got my bahn my and left without looking at him again. Haircut was very good and man was friendly but that was just very weird and I&#x27;d never expect that from an older gentlemen, maybe a bargirl in thailand perhaps. Any people experience that ? It felt quite violating to be honest.

                              <span>I am really fond of Vietnamese friendliness and hospitality, although there is a minor problem in how the waiting lines work here. I&#x27;ve been in some queues, and especially young adults are those who seem not to care about the line and just cut it for their own good. Imo, it&#x27;s better to ask people when we start queuing whether they are in a line and wait until our turn. I love Viet Nam, but i hope people will eventually get better mindset to be nicer to others. Have a good day, yall.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be in Ho Chi Minh twice for a couple of days each in January and would like to have some custom suits made while I&#x27;m there. Right now I&#x27;m leaning towards Binh Tailor as they do women&#x27;s clothing (my wife wants some as well) and they have good reviews. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than I&#x27;d prefer but want something that is good quality. 
 Anyone used them? How did they turn out? Any other places I should check out?

 I am a student at the University of Amsterdam and am currently looking for native Vietnamese synaesthetes as part of an ongoing research project. Synaesthesia is a unique perceptual phenomenon in which someone experiences a merging of their senses, for example, they may experience a colour as a sound or letters as having distinct colours. 
 If you think you might have synaesthesia or know of anyone who has synaesthesia, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out! Your participation in the project will be compensated :)

                              <span>Pretext: I’ve been in the old quarter for 5 days already getting a bit bored. I have 3 days left and need to move. Is west Lake viable for a tourist who likes to eat? It seems tiresome to have to get out around the lake every time 
 Also thinking about Ba Dinh potentially? In between west lake and old quarter

I’m considering buying the coffee drip (?) from Cafe Guiang based on a post I read here but would like to see if others have any other suggestions. If you know the price too, that would be nice. Staying at Hanoi Old Quarter so somewhere close would be appreciated! :)

And the pieces of information you can get from this article are the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) score and the rank. Also according to the journalist: &quot;The CPI score is still below average, which means the government is still corrupt&quot;. I&#x27;m not expressing my personal opinions here (as my opinions suck), just giving information. Here is the link, by the way: https://nhandan.vn/quyet-liet-ngan-chan-tham-nhung-gop-phan-phat-trien-kinh-te-xa-hoi-post746315.html What do you think? P.S: not to mention the anti-corruption caricatures by Tuổi Trẻ (translation: Youth), which is also state-owned.

Wondering about vegetarian-friendly options, specifically if dishes like Phở chay and Banh mì chay are 100% vegetarian or if they include non-vegetarian elements like chicken broth or oyster sauce. Any tips or pointers on vegetarian street food in Vietnam would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!

 &quot; The article discusses the legal victory of teacher Lê Cao Tánh after being dismissed from his position for 15 years. The incident leading to his dismissal occurred in 2006 when, in response to disruptive behavior from a student, Tánh slapped the student, resulting in a bleeding nose. The school, Trường Nguyễn Du in Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, terminated his employment, citing a violation of the teacher&#x27;s ethical standards.
 Tánh contested the decision and went through a lengthy legal battle, facing initial rejections in both trial and appeal courts.

However, I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative reviews with vietjet air about delays and terrible customer service. Has anybody here had experience with Vietjet from Hanoi to Siem reap and how was the experience? also since i dont have checked-in luggage, can i check in online to skip the q at the baggage counter? thank you!

                              <span>Met a nice businessman from Singapore who told me about buying property in Vietnam as an investment. He’s very bullish on the real estate in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. Sounds like a really attractive prospect since I can’t really afford a home in California. 
 Was wondering how this works. I’m assuming it’s frowned upon but also isn’t Vietnam communist? So can one truly purchase land or is it land use rights? Is there a property management industry like the US? Is contract law respected here? Can a foreigner even own land?
 As a fast growing economy I see reason to both allow and limit how foreign investment enters a country (especially after seeing how foreign money came into the states pre-pandemic).
 Disclaimer: I’m just a tourist and I don’t think I’d actually buy here. I don’t have any personal ties here so I’d be too scared to put significant money here. The businessman told me about police bribery and getting screwed over by his last partner here.

 The salary I have in mind would be something around 500 usd per month and working hours flexible on site in hcmc.

                              <span>Hello! I am a young 21 year old female who wants to travel to Vietnam! I was born in California but never traveled to Vietnam before. I am Vietnamese and I understand the language a lot! I can speak and read. I am currently not in college or school due to personal reasons and I want to explore! 
 I do not know anyone in Vietnam. I really want to travel but nobody I know in California can go due to school and work. I saved up a lot of money. I would love to create my own business there one day! My dream business is to create a luxurious spa in Vietnam! 💗💗
 if anyone has advice on traveling alone and starting my own business, please let me know!

                              <span>Hello! I will have a wedding in Ho Chi Minh City in February. I am looking for an ao dai rental shop to rent an ao dai for myself (6 ft 1, &gt;250 lbs), 6 groomsmen, and my dad. I have been searching on Facebook and Google Maps but cannot find a place that carries my size. I prefer &quot;ao tac&quot; or &quot;ao dai gam suong&quot; but at this point, they don&#x27;t matter as long as I can find one that has my size.
 Please let me know if you know a place. Thank you so much.

                              <span>Chào mng. Trước đây, em chưa đủ chín chắn để suy nghĩ trước khi quyết định làm một việc gì đó, em chỉ nghĩ đến cái vui vẻ nhất thời lúc đó, làm những việc không nghĩ đến hậu quả. Hiện tại khi nghĩ lại những chuyện ngày trước em đã làm trong quá khứ, em cảm thấy chúng như những vết nhơ không thể xoá sạch trong cuộc đời em 😞 em luôn không đủ tự tin, luôn cảm thấy mình không xứng đáng với bất cứ điều gì tốt đẹp. Em thấy bản thân rất tệ và rất kinh tởm dù cho đó là những điều từ quá khứ. Em nên làm gì ạ? 😞

                              <span>I’ll be heading to Vietnam soon for about a month and I take tramadol everyday for arthritis. I can’t find any solid info on whether it’s available over the counter in Vietnam? I have a prescription but it’s an electronic prescription so I’m not sure it’s valid there. 
 Any info much appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read a few fiction books in Vietnamese in the last few years as a way to expand my Vietnamese study in an enjoyable way. I have gotten fairly good at reading now and really enjoy reading Vietnamese as a non-native speaker/reader.
 My 18 yo nephew in-law is Vietnamese, speaks good English and is also starting to read books in English. I want to help find him some appropriate novels to start with, so I&#x27;m interested to see what other Viet-&gt;Eng learners went with when they started reading. 
 He&#x27;s most interested in adventure and detective fiction.

                              <span>as the title says.
 recently my (French) friend who was working in HCMC told me about his Vietnamese teacher&#x27;s &quot;weird lessons&quot;:
  
she took him to a bookstore and grabbed a few 123Vietnamese books (he paid for them)
 &quot;just complete the exercises&quot;
 two (or three, if she&#x27;s free) 1-hour coffee dates each week where they talked about random topics in Vietnamese (he paid for the drinks)
 she would help him translate Vietnamese things via zalo
  
apparently he learned nothing more than what to say after &quot;xin chào&quot; and a few slurs, and he had been learning for almost two months. when i asked about the price, it was around 300,000vnđ / date and a flat fee of 1,500,000đ per month for the zalo help. isn&#x27;t that a lot?
 things were so weird so i had to ask about the teacher herself. and after some quick check on her zalo profile: she was a 20yo university student whose major was definitely not teaching Vietnamese. i felt so bad for the guy and i gave him some advices to look for a new teacher or just go to language center that offers better services.
 this was not a &quot;scam&quot;, just a plain bad way to teach someone Vietnamese while having a fairly high price.
 definitely a scam where she tricked the foreigner into thinking she&#x27;s a professional.
 time is tough recently, i know, but girl (and guy) please, being a Vietnamese does not mean you are allowed to &quot;teach&quot; a foreigner. can you guys just be language exchange partners instead?

                              <span>I crashed my drone whilst I was doing the ha giang loop and have only just been able to obtain the GPS coordinates now that I am back home in Australia.
 I was hoping someone that is doing the loop would be able to make a slight detour and collect it.
 It is on the main road that is apart of the loop, and approximately 40m off the road in the bush.
 If anyone is able to, I can privately send them the exact coordinates, as well as satellite imagery of the exact location. 
 Offering a 1 Million Vietnamese Dong reward I will also pay for postage of just the SD card, and you may keep the drone if you want.

                              <span>So from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/18ql057
 I saw that many people think that compare a person to a dog is a casual, light-hearted joke. I am not sure about that in western, but in Vietnam, it is totally not true. In Vietnam, compared a person to a dog, no matter your intention, is a serious insult asking for violence. The similar one in the west is &quot;fu*k u bit*h!&quot; or &quot;you son of a bit*h!&quot;. So yeah, just don&#x27;t do it. The only exception is that you intentionally want to insult the other and want to have a fight :)
 Edit: as mentioned by some people &quot;cún&quot; (puppy) is fine for kids and girl friends to show that they are cute and you love them. &quot;chó&quot;, on the other hand, is not ok.

                              <span>Hi r/Vietnam,
 Happy holidays first of all.So I am lucky to be a part of Reddit Collectible Avatar program where Reddit provides a platform for small indie graphic designers like me to sell mascot skins/avatars. Today I have submitted an avatar in the shop with the art style inspired by the traditional Vietnamese lacquer painting: mother-of-pearl art.
 Nacre - the avatar. Find more details about this in my profile link
 As an appreciation for the art influence, I want to do a small giveaway to one member of our sub. To enter, simply reply to this question as a comment to this post: Have you heard about the Reddit Collectible Avatar (before reading this post of course)?Submission closes on Saturday 30.12.2023 at 12 pm CEST, then I will use RedditRaffle to pick a random lucky comment.
 [I have reached out to mods for approval for this giveaway]

                              <span>I want to buy some local goods but edible goods are similar with ehat we have in the PH. I am also seeing a lot of Circle K but it is a convenience store and I believe the supermarket in big stores or &quot;malls&quot; are cheaper.
 Any stores you can recommend? A lot of souvenir shops near Old Quarters but im pretty sure theyre tourist price.

 I&#x27;m a 33yo traveling with some friends around Vietnam in February 2024. Would you change anything in this itinerary? It feels a bit rushed.
  
Day 1-3: Hanoi
 Day 4-6: Halong Bay
 Day 7-8: Hue
 Day 9-10: Hoi An
 Day 11-12: Da Nang
 Day 13-15: Ho Chi Minh City
  
Any guidance is appreciated!

                              <span>I would like to purchase some rings, bracelets or necklaces in the above purity in TPHCM.
 Shopping around I managed to scout out a few places (SJC, PNJ, Doji, vendors in gold street in Q5) and the prices/premiums quoted were in the normal range of 1-5% over spot.
 Unfortunately I couldnt get out of the staff whether or not sales tax (10%) was applied to these products or if they are tax free/reduced taxation applies. I cant find anything online really.
 Would somebody here be so kind to enlighten me ?
 Also yes I am aware of the 300g limit of personal gold jewelry when entering/leaving the country.
 Thanks and regards!

                              <span>Hi guys, so I bought a motorbike in Saigon a little over a month ago.
 I took it to Cambodia pretty much immediately. No one batted an eye about the bike. I drove it straight through. Not asked for papers or nothing. Spent a week there and then went back to Vietnam. Same story.
 After spending a few weeks riding up through Vietnam and getting caught in some heavy rainfall and cold as shit weather I figured I&#x27;d cross over to Laos and get some sun.
 I was wrong. I tried crossing the border near Khe Sanh, I think it was called Lao Bao. They wouldn&#x27;t let me take the bike. Didn&#x27;t even ask for the papers, just straight up no.
 Should I try a different crossing? How do I get my bike into Laos? Would love to get some tips on this.

                              <span>Not sure if anyone has noticed but there are quite a few older korean men in vietnam, more specifically here in Da Nang that are with thin, small framed Vietnamese girls. They literally just go on dates and sit there without saying a word to each other. 
 What is this? Is this some sort of rent a girlfriend service or sugar daddy/sugar baby relationship?

                              <span>Pictures were taken using Nikon d7000. Hoping you guys will like it as much as I do. 
 Also, some of you may notice that colors maybe dull or too bright, this is because I am still new to photography and I am on the stage of testing waters while on manual mode. Cheers everyone!

                              <span>Hi all, this will be my first time travelling to Vietnam and will be going to Da Nang after reading/hearing about how nice the city is. We are heading over in a weeks time. 
 My partner and I are big foodies and all the travel blogs we&#x27;ve seen have shown how well priced and good the food is there (especially seafood). 
 What are your recommendations for any specific street food shops/markets/restaurants in Da Nang?
 My understanding is seafood will be the focus but all recommendations welcome. 
 Of course, any pho and bahn mi recommendations are a must-have too.

                              <span>So there&#x27;s a small situation. Earlier this morning i got some errands to run with my mom at Phan Thiet, Binh Thuan. We supposed to meet a friend of my mom around district 9 then he drived us all to Phan Thiet. We couldn&#x27;t find a proper parking slot but a nice household let we parked at their home. The thing is there is no ticket required. Even though i have some small bumps of uncertainties, i still gamble over the kindness and friendliness in Vietnamese. It may be my overthinking mind. It would be extremely helpful for me to know what is your opinion about this. Thanks a lot. Have a great day too.

                              <span>Hi!
 My parents immigrated a few years before I was born in the US. I have a bit of family back home whom I&#x27;ve only met once. But of course I understand it&#x27;s very tough back home and my family struggles often with money. 
 One of my cousins is graduating high school this year and I just learned today that her parents are in no place to afford college tuition. They&#x27;ve all resigned themselves to that reality. My older cousin (different parents) also couldn&#x27;t go to college and she makes 7 million a month, and the cycle of economic struggle persists. I&#x27;m in a position to send money for my little cousin&#x27;s tuition, unfortunately couldn&#x27;t help my older cousin in the same way. It is a no brainer for me. However, I want understanding of what higher education in Vietnam entails. More so out of curiosity and wanting to show support in learning about her experience than anything else.
 What is the cost? My family is based in Saigon, what are the schools nearby like, I don&#x27;t think she is interested in being too far from family. Is it difficult to get into universities? What opportunities does a college degree afford? Googling I found the average entry level salary for a college graduate is 20-25 million. Any other information that comes to mind that I didn&#x27;t think of?
 My mother didn&#x27;t finish 8th grade due to poverty and hardship. My brother and I now have master&#x27;s degrees, it is her greatest pride. I&#x27;m now a teacher, nothing is more important to me than education and knowledge. Thank you so much for helping me become better informed!!!

                              <span>I left my laptop at the security scan @ Noi Bai airport last week. I didn&#x27;t realize this until I had flown back to Canada, my home country. Noi Bai&#x27;s lost and found website shows they have it in their possession (they take pictures and post them on their website of all of their lost items). I have hired a vietnamese interpreter to speak to staff there, however they are saying it&#x27;s not their responsibility to put the lost item on the plane and that it is the responsibility of the airlines. I have contacted Japan airlines, the airline I flew on and their customer service is telling me it is the responsibility of the security/lost &amp; found staff, so now I&#x27;m in this circle of each party saying it&#x27;s the other person&#x27;s responsbility. Has anyone on here ever lost something at Noi Bai? Can you tell me the steps you took to retrieve your item? (This is a laptop by the way) Any help here would be greatly appreciated as it has just about been two weeks and a dozen phone calls and I have gotten absolutely nowhere.

                              <span>I have a theory, and I&#x27;m hoping someone here can confirm or debunk it for me.
 I spent the weekend celebrating Christmas in Tam Đảo (it was lovely, thank you, merry Christmas), and I saw something that I&#x27;ve only seen a couple of times over the many years that I have lived here, but I think there has to be a reason behind it.
 Two big, black, brand new SUVs drove by with the blue government plates, then a meticulously upkept early 90&#x27;s Toyota corolla, then two more fancy SUVs with government plates, and the guy in the corolla was dressed very well, clearly had money.
 Now, my theory is super wealthy people in VN have their cars from the early 90&#x27;s, and because they&#x27;re really rich, they&#x27;re perfectly taken care of. And the reason for showing off such a generic, low-end car is because they are conveying that they are rich enough and important enough that they were able to afford a car in the early 90&#x27;s, when this was an extreme rarity. 
 Is this a real thing, or is there some other reason for this? Because I have only seen it a few times, but it has been more than once, so there has to be some reason that wealthy/well-connected people would choose to drive a 90&#x27;s corolla or equivalent level car, right?

                              <span>A Vietnamese comment on Reddit told me that I am not Vietnamese if I don&#x27;t see the fact the majority of people in Vietnam removed the right-side mirror of their motorcycle (if there are 7 motorcycles in the street, there are 5 motorcycles that have been removed the right-side mirror). But I don&#x27;t see that in my city (Da Nang) and other Vietnamese cities I have traveled to. The vast majority of bikes have two mirrors on both sides. The percentage of bikes with the right-side mirror removed is so low that it is unnoticeable. This percentage may be as high as the percentage of motorbikes that lost the left-side mirror or the motorbikes that lost mirrors on both sides.
 Another Reddit comment assumes that I am Vietnamese but living overseas. And so on....
 I brought it to a Vietnamese forum VOZ and asked if the experience of Reddit Vietnamese matched what happens in the place Vozer lives, they confirmed it was real. Maybe they joke to me, I don&#x27;t know. But If people are joking, please stop, I don&#x27;t know what is joking and what is real. What I see with my own eyes from when I was born to now (being a 25-year-old man) is not something people in Reddit and Voz described.
 I am Vietnamese but people say that I am not Vietnamese, even when I have written in Vietnamese in a local/urban/vulgar style that only Vietnamese use. They just said to me that I use Google, Google Translate, ChatGPT, or AI to pretend I am Vietnamese. It is kind of sad.

                              <span>Mình post lên đây để mọi người đề phòng với hội này.
 Hải SapaTV là 1 kênh youtube ẩm thực thuộc diện lớn ở VN, với hơn 1 triệu người đăng ký, nhiều đầu mối bán hàng, có nhà hàng và khách sạn ở Sapa, và quan hệ rộng. Trước gia đình mình các cụ ở nhà rảnh rỗi hay xem. Thấy nó quảng cáo bán hàng khá hấp dẫn nên vừa rồi các cụ cũng đặt mua hàng.
 Mặt hàng này là thịt trâu gác bếp (thịt trâu sấy khô). Quảng cáo là để trong tủ đá trữ được 6 tháng. Bán khá đắt (1 triệu vnd / 1kg) nên mình hi vọng chất lượng tốt. 
 Không ngờ mua về để tủ đá, mới được hơn 1 tuần thì 1 gói đã mốc trắng như vậy.
 Mình gọi điện đường dây nóng phản ánh với chủ shop thì chủ shop mồm năm miệng mười, nói lấn át cả khách, đổ lỗi cho khách bảo quản.
 Mình để cả 2 gói trong tủ đá, nếu do bảo quản thì cả 2 phải bị chứ. Chưa kể trong tủ đá còn rất nhiều đồ ăn khô không bị làm sao.
 Theo mình suy đoán thì vì bán nhiều hàng nên nó làm láo, trộng hàng cũ vào bán cho khách online. Ai không cẩn thận là ăn phải hàng ôi thiu. 
 Mình post lên để mọi người đề phòng với kênh youtube và hội này. Đừng để vừa mất tiền vừa mua tức vào người.
 Long story short, if you don’t know Vietnamese, stay away from SapaTV food, restaurants, and hotel. I bought their products and receive old, rotten food.

                              <span>I dont understand why some restaurants only serve buffet when there are 2 or more customers. I know they will get more profit if they do that but on the hand, if the restaurant fits one&#x27;s favor, they will comeback overtime,so technically it&#x27;s the same. It is frustrating that my friend cant come with me to high-class buffet( due to overpriced) and they dont serve only one customer.

                              <span>I’m traveling from the US to Vietnam soon for an extended period and would like to keep my US number to receive 2FA sms for US banks and apps. I’m looking into using a plan from Tello mobile as a cheap option. I read that Tello doesn’t offer roaming, but enabling wifi-calling would allow me to receive 2FA messages from the US. However, I saw somewhere that says Vietnam does not allow wifi-calling and so this option would not work. Does anyone have similar experiences that can help shed light on whether this is true? Thanks!

This is what we were planning to do, take a day cruise that picks us up from Hanoi and leaves us at Cat Ba at the end of the night, we spend a night, go to the national park the next day and come back to Hanoi. Does this make sense, or shall we spend an extra day in Cat ba? which hotel would you recommend and which activities?

                              <span>Travel to Vietnam, Hanoi for 1 week in few days time. Do I need to do any pre-documentation due to covid? I do not see any notice from flight provider. Is there anything I need to prepare or fill up prior to departure?

                              <span>A friend today told me that 5 or 7 years after the burial of someone, people will uncover the body and put it in a new place and build something bigger.
 Is this something that most people do? I had a quick Google but couldn&#x27;t find anything.
 ps: My Vietnamese is not strong, so not sure about the specifics.

                              <span>When I first noticed this on a scooter, I thought maybe they were too poor to replace it. I thought it looks ridiculous. I&#x27;ve heard that only the left is required by law. Do locals remove it because they think mirrors look uncool? I really don&#x27;t understand the point in it, even if you don&#x27;t look in the mirrors, why remove them? I don&#x27;t recall noticing it anywhere else in southeast Asia. Since then I&#x27;ve noticed maybe 40% or more of the scooters in my area only keep a small left mirror on the bike, especially Vario drivers... I drive a Vario myself and look in the right mirror a lot to keep an eye out for any ninjas creeping up to overtake me on the right side.

                              <span>To my backround, Im a viet born and raised in germany, now Im in vietnam for 2 months to mainly learn the language. Back to the topic. So Im 17 yo guy, naturally my family is starting to ask &quot;hey you got a girlfriend yet?&quot;, of course no, so they reply with &quot;oh how about finding a girlfriend here, marry and bring her back to german?&quot;. I was a bit put off because in germany (or west) people marry in a much older age and woman want alot of privacy and freedom. I doubt that that these days girls in VN would want to marry that quick and leave their country, but Im not sure with my lack of knowledge so how is your guys views on this stuff?
 Edit: Thanks for the replies. I dont actually think of doing it lol.

 Where do i find cheap jackets to help me with the weather? Im staying in Grand Menora Danang Hotel. Any night markets near here?

                              <span>So I just wondered how do you spent Christmas? Is it a thing here? Like it is in western world with a tree, gifts and so on?

 I’m really curious about the traditions here

                              <span>Xin chao,
 Next month I intend to cycle from HCMC to Hanoi, with roughly the following itinerary over 28 days:
 HCMC - Vung Tau - La Gi - Mui Ne - Thap Cham - Da Lat - Nha Trang - Tuy Hoa - Quy Nhon
 (bus to Kon Tum) - Mang Den - Da Ban - Quang Ngai - Hoi An - Da Nang - Hue
 (train to Ninh Binh) - Tam Coc loop - (train to Hanoi)
 Ideally I want to spend 2+ days in the larger places mentioned and 3 in the big cities. Now the questions:
 ​
  
If I dismantle my touring bike (front wheel off) and have it bagged, is it possible to transport it on a bus if I want to &quot;skip&quot; a stage (due to bad weather, injury, etc.) - e.g. Quy Nhon -&gt; Kon Tum
 How easy is it to ride out of HCMC towards Vung Tau?
 Away from the coast, is it necessary to book hotels/guesthouses in advance, or can you just show up on the day and realistically expect a room? (my dates don&#x27;t overlap with Tet). Ideally I&#x27;d like to save weight and not have to bring a tent or wild camp.
 I only finalised this trip last week, so probably won&#x27;t be able to learn/speak much Tieng Viet language, and my tonal pronunciation will probably be wrong. Is this likely to be a big barrier in the rural parts of the Central Highlands?
 Do most hotels/guesthouses/hostels accept card payment?
 For trains (e.g. Hue to Ninh Binh) do tickets (particularly for travellers with bicycles) need to be reserved a day in advance?
 Are there any parts of that itinerary that you reckon should be skipped given that it&#x27;s January?
 And are there any sights you would really recommend that I&#x27;ve not included? (I&#x27;ve excluded Sapa, Ha Giang and Dien Bien Phu given that presumably it&#x27;s pretty cold (&lt;10 degrees) at this time of year, and I would guess the earliest days of February in Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay can still be foggy, so I&#x27;d leave that for a summer trip, given I only have 28 days). The karst caves at Phong Nga are, I guess, probably tricky to reach on a bicycle too.
  
Cam on rat nhieu.

                              <span>Hey,
 Just wondering about the title.
 From my time I met with a Vietnamese woman. She was married but wore no ring. Said he husband cheats on her but she couldn&#x27;t leave him because it was frowned upon by her family unless she had someone else who could look after her. Even then her family would have to go to his to make the arrangements for her to leave him. 
 Is divorce really looked down upon in Vietnam or is this bullshit?

                              <span>Hi, I currently having to deal with 2 packages delivering to Vietnam. One of them in from USPS departed to HCM city and one is DHL. How long does USPS going to ship to Vietnam? I’ve never seen anyone successfully receive their package from US to Vietnam through USPS. 
 One more package I have is using DHL to ship, from Germany to Vietnam. However the package lost update since November 6 and my seller filed for lost parcel. But on December 15 the tracking was back but it has been stuck in customs since then.
 I don’t know what to do besides waiting, but I know where the package is because it shows me the address where the package is at, can I just go to that address and get my package immediately or I need to wait for the customs and god knows how long. Some said that I need to pay import taxes but I thought that items that are over 2,000,000vnd doesn’t require to pay tax. Does anyone know what to do??? It’s so complicated.

 Hegel was one of a series of German philosophers (including Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Marx) in the 18th and 19th centuries who wrote on the subject of historical and social progress. Speaking very broadly, the idea is something like this: A, society exists in a certain state, with certain rules and traditions and practices. B, the limitations of these rules and traditions and practices prompt a reaction against them. C, the established system and the reaction against it combine to form a new system, informed by both, which then becomes part A of a new cycle. A, ,B and C are often called &quot;thesis&quot;, &quot;antithesis&quot; and &quot;synthesis&quot;.
 Now, you can apply this pattern very broadly, to describe the foundations of epistemology - exploring how human knowledge arises from combining the abstr…</span>

                              <span>Currently in Hue checking out the tombs and the imperial citadel. Weather in Central Vietnam has been quite cold and rainy so far. My brother and I want to do the Ha Giang Loop around the end of this month but reading online, some people say around this time the weather may not make it worthwhile (foggy, etc). Do you think it&#x27;s still worth doing?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been living in Vietnam for a year, and some things about the culture I find genuinely bizarre. 
 Around the corner from my place is a big bia hơi kinda place, and there are always 3 or 4 guys stood in the road trying to flag people down, waving at them, even jumping in front of bikes from time to time. 
 Of course, I&#x27;m well travelled and people trying to stop pedestrians is common all over the world, but vehicles? In my mind, I rarely drive around aimlessly, if I&#x27;m on my bike it means I am going somewhere, why would I go into these places on a whim? I have never once seen anyone stop for one of these people, so... What&#x27;s the point? It&#x27;s just an annoyance it seems. 
 Maybe I&#x27;m missing something but it seems pretty odd.

                              <span>Many people in this subreddit say they teach English, but if you are from a Vietnamese family, what is it like to learn English?
 Possible points to contemplate:
  
How does English compare with tiếng Việt?
 Are you perchance the first, second, or third of your family line to become fluent English?
 Do you use English with your family?
 Did you have to go overseas to perfect your English?
 Has English skill given you notable opportunities?
 Have you had interesting instructors?
  
I am not Vietnamese, but I find it pleasant to talk with Vietnamese citizens and Việt kiều in this forum.

I’ve also emailed them multiple times and they always just say wait 2 business days. It’s been more than a week now. Does anyone know how to reach support, preferably in English? I don’t know any Vietnamese unfortunately. Thanks for all your help!

 What is your secret? 
 How did you learn to do it ? 
 I see many Vietnamese be able to calculate and sell and do business really well, it just seems like it&#x27;s a big part of the culture too, to hustle and to work hard on their business.

                              <span>Hi, all! I&#x27;m currently comparing options for Vietnam tours for late February, 2024. There are two that are extremely similar-- same tour company, similar price, almost identical destinations-- except that one travels to Hoi An and one travels to the Mai Chau Valley. I love visiting historical sites and especially UNESCO World Heritage landmarks, but I&#x27;ve read that Hoi An is very touristy and a bit of a let-down for some Redditors. Mai Chau Valley looks breathtaking and a bit more off the beaten path, but I could use some opinions on it from people who have been there.
 Which of these tours would you pick?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m an American-born Vietnamese, Mom came here in the nineties and recently became a naturalized US Citizen. My mom has her original birth certificate from Binh Dinh (pretty old and raggedy at this point lol) and she wants me to find out how to get her dual citizenship/Vietnamese passport. She&#x27;s been thinking about returning to Vietnam to retire soon and be with her siblings who stayed in Vietnam.
 Any other VK&#x27;s here done this before? I&#x27;d love to get details and specifics - A lot of conflicting information online along with just outright confusing info so it&#x27;d be nice to actually hear from others who&#x27;ve done this. 
 I&#x27;ve tried emailing and calling the consulate and embassy in the US as well but they&#x27;ve been surprisingly unhelpful and unresponsive lmao.

                              <span>Hello All! Hope everyone is well! I&#x27;m from Singapore.
 I&#x27;m planning to solo travel/ backpack for the first time ever to different countries in SEA in Jan 2024. Preferably starting from 3 Jan - 16 Jan 2024. I&#x27;m planning to stay in a hostel. Main point of this trip is to learn new culture, explore amazing cuisines, do fun local activities, meet new people, relax, enjoy, take amazing pictures and create awesome memories!
 I think Sapa &amp; Hanoi in Vietnam would be a great choice! 
 What do you think? Anyone can share with me travel tips or where else I can go in Vietnam in Jan 2024?

How many % do I have to pay?
 How can I submit my tax report?
 How often do I have to do this?

                              <span>Im travelling to Vietnam from Sydney, and im thinking of using a Wise debit card and Wise convertion since its charges really low rates (less than 1%) https://wise.com/au/
 Would I be able to use the Wise debit card in Vietnam? I am going to all the major cities in 14 days, I am doing a tour so most of the stuff like accommodation and domestic flights are all already paid but I still need cash to get food and etc.
 Using my regular bank card ANZ or Commonwealth kinda sucks because its 3% conversion rate. What is the best way to get money out from atms in Vietnam?

                              <span>I looked for some guides on the internet about this, but most of them are from Americans or Europeans, and their dating cultures are so different from each other and from Vietnamese that I don&#x27;t think I can learn anything from them. So I really need some insight from my fellow people. Here are my questions:
  
Outside of online dating, how did you meet your gf and ex? Are most of them previously your friends, your coworkers, someone you were already familiar with? Or just strangers you bumped into?
 When you&#x27;re interested in a girl, how do you approach her? My understanding is that you&#x27;d ask her out for a coffee, a milk tea, right? How successful were you? How often did you get rejected? If rejected, do you just move on and ask the next girl you&#x27;re interested in, or do you persist and try again later? Are you usually interested in a lot of girls at once, or just focus on one target?
 If she accepts your invitation for a milk tea, how often did it turn into an official relationship? I mean, is dating supposed to be a numbers game where you repeatedly ask a lot of girls out, repeatedly go out with a lot of girls, just to successfully obtain a gf once in a while (let alone a wife)? I see that most people enter a relationship very easily, so it can&#x27;t be that tedious, right?

                              <span>Hey! ;)
 My Vietnamese fiancée and me (from Germany) will celebrate our wedding in Đà Nẵng next year in early September. We are looking for a band who can perform both Vietnamese songs and English rock/alternative/pop music. We are planning a wedding that will combine both Vietnamese and &quot;Western&quot; traditions - and, of course, our own wishes and visions. 
 We expect around a hundred guests. Most guests will be from Vietnam, but many people from Germany and other nations from around the world will hopefully join. So, it will be wonderful to have people from all over the world to come together, celebrate and connect with one another. We hope a band will be able to play a set before dinner and one afterwards. So, maybe around 3-4 hours in total. Afterwards, we will have a DJ put on some music and we invite the band members to join and celebrate with us. 
 If you or someone you know might be interested, please message me! ;) Looking forward to hear from you!
 All best
 Niko

                              <span>I&#x27;m into listening(podcasts)/watching(YouTube)/reading about murder mysteries/unsolved cases/crime stories. I am Viet Kieu and can understand and speak Vietnamese. I am trying to learn to read/write in Vietnamese. Out of all the stories that I&#x27;ve heard about, it&#x27;s very rare that I hear a story from Vietnam. A few months ago, I heard about Dung Hà (Vietnamese female gangster) and found her story quite fascinating. I was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction (YouTube, podcast, websites, books) where I can learn more stories such as this? I&#x27;d really appreciate it!

                              <span>Hey!
 I’m an American born Vietnamese who would like to re-learn the language after 20 some odd years of not being fluent.
 My mom re-married after immigrating to America and our household was fully English speaking from the time I was 9 so it sort of fell to the wayside.
 I can listen and comprehend okay (still pretty bad) but my speaking is garbage to put it lightly.
 I’ve tried using duo lingo but I think the dialect is mostly northern whereas my family and friends are from the south so that’s what I would like to focus my learning around.
 Of course I can always speak to my mom now but she’s not really equipped to “teach” it so to speak.
 What are some good resources online? Is it worth it to find a private tutor? I know a few viet friends who learned/perfected their English by watching tv, can the same be said about consuming Vietnamese media with English subtitles? Is that even a thing?
 I think my biggest hurdle is embarrassment/awkwardness when it comes to talking, I lose confidence and don’t want to sound like an idiot so it’s hard to stay consistent.
 Any ideas?

 Is it worth staying in Can Tho for 2 nights, or since we really only have like 1.5 days in HCMC, we should skip staying in Can Tho and just take a day trip?

                              <span>Hello! I’m searching for advice and help, especially from the Vietnamese families. I’ve had my first daughter and wanting to bring her back to Vietnam with my white husband. First, a litttle background, I’ve been isolated from my family in Vietnam for many years because of disagreements between them and my mother. In preparing to go for a month, during Tet, and my mother told me I need to prepare at least $8,000cad to pay for all of my extended family members groceries, outings, transportation and rent for my relatives. 
 I know it is normal for me to prepare li xi for my younger cousins and for when I arrive and leave but I’m not sure how much is reasonable to give, I’m thinking around 1,000,000dong each time is a bit much because I have 10 aunts and uncles and each of them have 2-3 child…</span>

                              <span>Hello! Sorry if this is more suited for the sticky thread, but its quite specific.
 I was adopted from Hanoi in 1992 and I am currently visiting Vietnam and Hanoi.
 I wanted to show the adoption clinic to my children but neither me nor my parents remember the address(we visited the facility in 2008/2009). I am aware that we need permission to enter the facility but we only want to see the outside.
 The only information I have is that the clinic was called &quot;B clinic&quot; or &quot;Clinic B&quot; back in 1992 and I believe it was still in operation in 2008/2009. However the name can have changed. 
 Any information is of value as we leave Hanoi on the 23rd of December and only have tomorrow to find and visit the facility.
 Thanks in advance!

 Man, woman, 2 small children. Can&#x27;t recall if the children were helmeted... But left me feeling it&#x27;s a new milestone.... Rather than Migrant workers coming to vn on their own or possibly in pairs, Migrant families living daily life in the city. It felt real off.

                              <span>am at the beggining of a motorcycle trip starting in HCMC and aiming to travel in the length of country. I&#x27;ve loved my time here so far and looking forward to the rest of the trip!
 I bought a motorbike in HCMC, a Yamaha T135, which has served me well the first week. However I obviously wasn&#x27;t thorough enough when inspecting it since I&#x27;ve only just realised the indicators are not orange but blue! I&#x27;m pretty sure its the bulbs themselves since the light housing is clear plastic. 
 My question to those in the know - is this illegal? Will I get pulled over by police as I travel from HCMC to Hanoi/Hai Gaing loop?
 I haven&#x27;t seen any other bikes with coloured indicators so far so a bit worried to be honest

                              <span>Hey fellow riders! I&#x27;m looking to purchase a Honda Winner X 2022 V3 (Red Color/Special Edition/ABS) in Hanoi, and I&#x27;ve heard second-hand might be the way to go. Any recommendations for trustworthy retailers in the city? Also, any advice on what to look out for and the legal procedures for a foreigner to acquire a motorbike in Vietnam? Considering having my Vietnamese wife buy it – thoughts on that? Appreciate all your insights! 🙌

As you can tell, these two places are.. EXTREMELY different. So.. to those who are Vietnamese but don’t live there.. What are some things you guys do that reminds you of Vietnam? Certain activities, places.. Etc..

 Are both usage of “tìm” correct? First screenshot accepts tìm but second doesn’t allow. When should I use “tìm thấy” vs “tìm”?
 Please also explain giúp versus giúp đỡ. Reason is one lesson I Learn it didnt allow me to use giúp đỡ tôi and corrected me with giúp tôi. Why is that? Does đỡ modified the word giúp? 
 Thanks. Cảm ơn.

                              <span>My coworker is an older gentleman who fought in Vietnam. He keeps a lot of pictures and memorabilia of his time there. He’s not sure where this picture came from, its relation to the Vietnam war, or if it was even taken in Vietnam. We couldn’t find anyone who knew how to translate it as most Asian Americans we asked said it wasn’t their language and even if it was they don’t read only speak. We think it’s written in Vietnamese but someone told us it was Chinese. Any ideas?
