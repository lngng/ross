                              <span>Hi r/Vietnam,
 Happy holidays first of all.So I am lucky to be a part of Reddit Collectible Avatar program where Reddit provides a platform for small indie graphic designers like me to sell mascot skins/avatars. Today I have submitted an avatar in the shop with the art style inspired by the traditional Vietnamese lacquer painting: mother-of-pearl art.
 Nacre - the avatar. Find more details about this in my profile link
 As an appreciation for the art influence, I want to do a small giveaway to one member of our sub. To enter, simply reply to this question as a comment to this post: Have you heard about the Reddit Collectible Avatar (before reading this post of course)?Submission closes on Saturday 30.12.2023 at 12 pm CEST, then I will use RedditRaffle to pick a random lucky comment.
 [I have reached out to mods for approval for this giveaway]

                              <span>I want to buy some local goods but edible goods are similar with ehat we have in the PH. I am also seeing a lot of Circle K but it is a convenience store and I believe the supermarket in big stores or &quot;malls&quot; are cheaper.
 Any stores you can recommend? A lot of souvenir shops near Old Quarters but im pretty sure theyre tourist price.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m a 33yo traveling with some friends around Vietnam in February 2024. Would you change anything in this itinerary? It feels a bit rushed.
  
Day 1-3: Hanoi
 Day 4-6: Halong Bay
 Day 7-8: Hue
 Day 9-10: Hoi An
 Day 11-12: Da Nang
 Day 13-15: Ho Chi Minh City
  
Any guidance is appreciated!

                              <span>I would like to purchase some rings, bracelets or necklaces in the above purity in TPHCM.
 Shopping around I managed to scout out a few places (SJC, PNJ, Doji, vendors in gold street in Q5) and the prices/premiums quoted were in the normal range of 1-5% over spot.
 Unfortunately I couldnt get out of the staff whether or not sales tax (10%) was applied to these products or if they are tax free/reduced taxation applies. I cant find anything online really.
 Would somebody here be so kind to enlighten me ?
 Also yes I am aware of the 300g limit of personal gold jewelry when entering/leaving the country.
 Thanks and regards!

                              <span>Hi guys, so I bought a motorbike in Saigon a little over a month ago.
 I took it to Cambodia pretty much immediately. No one batted an eye about the bike. I drove it straight through. Not asked for papers or nothing. Spent a week there and then went back to Vietnam. Same story.
 After spending a few weeks riding up through Vietnam and getting caught in some heavy rainfall and cold as shit weather I figured I&#x27;d cross over to Laos and get some sun.
 I was wrong. I tried crossing the border near Khe Sanh, I think it was called Lao Bao. They wouldn&#x27;t let me take the bike. Didn&#x27;t even ask for the papers, just straight up no.
 Should I try a different crossing? How do I get my bike into Laos? Would love to get some tips on this.

                              <span>Not sure if anyone has noticed but there are quite a few older korean men in vietnam, more specifically here in Da Nang that are with thin, small framed Vietnamese girls. They literally just go on dates and sit there without saying a word to each other. 
 What is this? Is this some sort of rent a girlfriend service or sugar daddy/sugar baby relationship?

                              <span>Pictures were taken using Nikon d7000. Hoping you guys will like it as much as I do. 
 Also, some of you may notice that colors maybe dull or too bright, this is because I am still new to photography and I am on the stage of testing waters while on manual mode. Cheers everyone!

                              <span>Hi all, this will be my first time travelling to Vietnam and will be going to Da Nang after reading/hearing about how nice the city is. We are heading over in a weeks time. 
 My partner and I are big foodies and all the travel blogs we&#x27;ve seen have shown how well priced and good the food is there (especially seafood). 
 What are your recommendations for any specific street food shops/markets/restaurants in Da Nang?
 My understanding is seafood will be the focus but all recommendations welcome. 
 Of course, any pho and bahn mi recommendations are a must-have too.

                              <span>So there&#x27;s a small situation. Earlier this morning i got some errands to run with my mom at Phan Thiet, Binh Thuan. We supposed to meet a friend of my mom around district 9 then he drived us all to Phan Thiet. We couldn&#x27;t find a proper parking slot but a nice household let we parked at their home. The thing is there is no ticket required. Even though i have some small bumps of uncertainties, i still gamble over the kindness and friendliness in Vietnamese. It may be my overthinking mind. It would be extremely helpful for me to know what is your opinion about this. Thanks a lot. Have a great day too.

                              <span>Hi!
 My parents immigrated a few years before I was born in the US. I have a bit of family back home whom I&#x27;ve only met once. But of course I understand it&#x27;s very tough back home and my family struggles often with money. 
 One of my cousins is graduating high school this year and I just learned today that her parents are in no place to afford college tuition. They&#x27;ve all resigned themselves to that reality. My older cousin (different parents) also couldn&#x27;t go to college and she makes 7 million a month, and the cycle of economic struggle persists. I&#x27;m in a position to send money for my little cousin&#x27;s tuition, unfortunately couldn&#x27;t help my older cousin in the same way. It is a no brainer for me. However, I want understanding of what higher education in Vietnam entails. More so out of curiosity and wanting to show support in learning about her experience than anything else.
 What is the cost? My family is based in Saigon, what are the schools nearby like, I don&#x27;t think she is interested in being too far from family. Is it difficult to get into universities? What opportunities does a college degree afford? Googling I found the average entry level salary for a college graduate is 20-25 million. Any other information that comes to mind that I didn&#x27;t think of?
 My mother didn&#x27;t finish 8th grade due to poverty and hardship. My brother and I now have master&#x27;s degrees, it is her greatest pride. I&#x27;m now a teacher, nothing is more important to me than education and knowledge. Thank you so much for helping me become better informed!!!

 Anyone know where one could go to get a bite plate/night guard (For grinding teeth during sleep) in Saigon?
 I&#x27;m looking to get a custom one made.

                              <span>I left my laptop at the security scan @ Noi Bai airport last week. I didn&#x27;t realize this until I had flown back to Canada, my home country. Noi Bai&#x27;s lost and found website shows they have it in their possession (they take pictures and post them on their website of all of their lost items). I have hired a vietnamese interpreter to speak to staff there, however they are saying it&#x27;s not their responsibility to put the lost item on the plane and that it is the responsibility of the airlines. I have contacted Japan airlines, the airline I flew on and their customer service is telling me it is the responsibility of the security/lost &amp; found staff, so now I&#x27;m in this circle of each party saying it&#x27;s the other person&#x27;s responsbility. Has anyone on here ever lost something at Noi Bai? Can you tell me the steps you took to retrieve your item? (This is a laptop by the way) Any help here would be greatly appreciated as it has just about been two weeks and a dozen phone calls and I have gotten absolutely nowhere.

                              <span>I have a theory, and I&#x27;m hoping someone here can confirm or debunk it for me.
 I spent the weekend celebrating Christmas in Tam Đảo (it was lovely, thank you, merry Christmas), and I saw something that I&#x27;ve only seen a couple of times over the many years that I have lived here, but I think there has to be a reason behind it.
 Two big, black, brand new SUVs drove by with the blue government plates, then a meticulously upkept early 90&#x27;s Toyota corolla, then two more fancy SUVs with government plates, and the guy in the corolla was dressed very well, clearly had money.
 Now, my theory is super wealthy people in VN have their cars from the early 90&#x27;s, and because they&#x27;re really rich, they&#x27;re perfectly taken care of. And the reason for showing off such a generic, low-end car is because they are conveying that they are rich enough and important enough that they were able to afford a car in the early 90&#x27;s, when this was an extreme rarity. 
 Is this a real thing, or is there some other reason for this? Because I have only seen it a few times, but it has been more than once, so there has to be some reason that wealthy/well-connected people would choose to drive a 90&#x27;s corolla or equivalent level car, right?

                              <span>A Vietnamese comment on Reddit told me that I am not Vietnamese if I don&#x27;t see the fact the majority of people in Vietnam removed the right-side mirror of their motorcycle (if there are 7 motorcycles in the street, there are 5 motorcycles that have been removed the right-side mirror). But I don&#x27;t see that in my city (Da Nang) and other Vietnamese cities I have traveled to. The vast majority of bikes have two mirrors on both sides. The percentage of bikes with the right-side mirror removed is so low that it is unnoticeable. This percentage may be as high as the percentage of motorbikes that lost the left-side mirror or the motorbikes that lost mirrors on both sides.
 Another Reddit comment assumes that I am Vietnamese but living overseas. And so on....
 I brought it to a Vietnamese forum VOZ and asked if the experience of Reddit Vietnamese matched what happens in the place Vozer lives, they confirmed it was real. Maybe they joke to me, I don&#x27;t know. But If people are joking, please stop, I don&#x27;t know what is joking and what is real. What I see with my own eyes from when I was born to now (being a 25-year-old man) is not something people in Reddit and Voz described.
 I am Vietnamese but people say that I am not Vietnamese, even when I have written in Vietnamese in a local/urban/vulgar style that only Vietnamese use. They just said to me that I use Google, Google Translate, ChatGPT, or AI to pretend I am Vietnamese. It is kind of sad.

                              <span>Mình post lên đây để mọi người đề phòng với hội này.
 Hải SapaTV là 1 kênh youtube ẩm thực thuộc diện lớn ở VN, với hơn 1 triệu người đăng ký, nhiều đầu mối bán hàng, có nhà hàng và khách sạn ở Sapa, và quan hệ rộng. Trước gia đình mình các cụ ở nhà rảnh rỗi hay xem. Thấy nó quảng cáo bán hàng khá hấp dẫn nên vừa rồi các cụ cũng đặt mua hàng.
 Mặt hàng này là thịt trâu gác bếp (thịt trâu sấy khô). Quảng cáo là để trong tủ đá trữ được 6 tháng. Bán khá đắt (1 triệu vnd / 1kg) nên mình hi vọng chất lượng tốt. 
 Không ngờ mua về để tủ đá, mới được hơn 1 tuần thì 1 gói đã mốc trắng như vậy.
 Mình gọi điện đường dây nóng phản ánh với chủ shop thì chủ shop mồm năm miệng mười, nói lấn át cả khách, đổ lỗi cho khách bảo quản.
 Mình để cả 2 gói trong tủ đá, nếu do bảo quản thì cả 2 phải bị chứ. Chưa kể trong tủ đá còn rất nhiều đồ ăn khô không bị làm sao.
 Theo mình suy đoán thì vì bán nhiều hàng nên nó làm láo, trộng hàng cũ vào bán cho khách online. Ai không cẩn thận là ăn phải hàng ôi thiu. 
 Mình post lên để mọi người đề phòng với kênh youtube và hội này. Đừng để vừa mất tiền vừa mua tức vào người.
 Long story short, if you don’t know Vietnamese, stay away from SapaTV food, restaurants, and hotel. I bought their products and receive old, rotten food.

                              <span>I dont understand why some restaurants only serve buffet when there are 2 or more customers. I know they will get more profit if they do that but on the hand, if the restaurant fits one&#x27;s favor, they will comeback overtime,so technically it&#x27;s the same. It is frustrating that my friend cant come with me to high-class buffet( due to overpriced) and they dont serve only one customer.

                              <span>I’m traveling from the US to Vietnam soon for an extended period and would like to keep my US number to receive 2FA sms for US banks and apps. I’m looking into using a plan from Tello mobile as a cheap option. I read that Tello doesn’t offer roaming, but enabling wifi-calling would allow me to receive 2FA messages from the US. However, I saw somewhere that says Vietnam does not allow wifi-calling and so this option would not work. Does anyone have similar experiences that can help shed light on whether this is true? Thanks!

This is what we were planning to do, take a day cruise that picks us up from Hanoi and leaves us at Cat Ba at the end of the night, we spend a night, go to the national park the next day and come back to Hanoi. Does this make sense, or shall we spend an extra day in Cat ba? which hotel would you recommend and which activities?

                              <span>A friend today told me that 5 or 7 years after the burial of someone, people will uncover the body and put it in a new place and build something bigger.
 Is this something that most people do? I had a quick Google but couldn&#x27;t find anything.
 ps: My Vietnamese is not strong, so not sure about the specifics.

                              <span>When I first noticed this on a scooter, I thought maybe they were too poor to replace it. I thought it looks ridiculous. I&#x27;ve heard that only the left is required by law. Do locals remove it because they think mirrors look uncool? I really don&#x27;t understand the point in it, even if you don&#x27;t look in the mirrors, why remove them? I don&#x27;t recall noticing it anywhere else in southeast Asia. Since then I&#x27;ve noticed maybe 40% or more of the scooters in my area only keep a small left mirror on the bike, especially Vario drivers... I drive a Vario myself and look in the right mirror a lot to keep an eye out for any ninjas creeping up to overtake me on the right side.

                              <span>To my backround, Im a viet born and raised in germany, now Im in vietnam for 2 months to mainly learn the language. Back to the topic. So Im 17 yo guy, naturally my family is starting to ask &quot;hey you got a girlfriend yet?&quot;, of course no, so they reply with &quot;oh how about finding a girlfriend here, marry and bring her back to german?&quot;. I was a bit put off because in germany (or west) people marry in a much older age and woman want alot of privacy and freedom. I doubt that that these days girls in VN would want to marry that quick and leave their country, but Im not sure with my lack of knowledge so how is your guys views on this stuff?
 Edit: Thanks for the replies. I dont actually think of doing it lol.

                              <span>Oh my gosh. I am from the philippines and i did not expect that it would be that cool/chilly here. Our tour guide informed us that it is 12°C here and in Hanoi it would reach to 10°C.
 Where do i find cheap jackets to help me with the weather? Im staying in Grand Menora Danang Hotel. Any night markets near here?

 I have noticed a lot of Christmas things here in Hanoi - but I always thinks it’s made for the tourists? 
 I’m really curious about the traditions here

                              <span>Xin chao,
 Next month I intend to cycle from HCMC to Hanoi, with roughly the following itinerary over 28 days:
 HCMC - Vung Tau - La Gi - Mui Ne - Thap Cham - Da Lat - Nha Trang - Tuy Hoa - Quy Nhon
 (bus to Kon Tum) - Mang Den - Da Ban - Quang Ngai - Hoi An - Da Nang - Hue
 (train to Ninh Binh) - Tam Coc loop - (train to Hanoi)
 Ideally I want to spend 2+ days in the larger places mentioned and 3 in the big cities. Now the questions:
 ​
  
If I dismantle my touring bike (front wheel off) and have it bagged, is it possible to transport it on a bus if I want to &quot;skip&quot; a stage (due to bad weather, injury, etc.) - e.g. Quy Nhon -&gt; Kon Tum
 How easy is it to ride out of HCMC towards Vung Tau?
 Away from the coast, is it necessary to book hotels/guesthouses in advance, or can you just show up on the day and realistically expect a room? (my dates don&#x27;t overlap with Tet). Ideally I&#x27;d like to save weight and not have to bring a tent or wild camp.
 I only finalised this trip last week, so probably won&#x27;t be able to learn/speak much Tieng Viet language, and my tonal pronunciation will probably be wrong. Is this likely to be a big barrier in the rural parts of the Central Highlands?
 Do most hotels/guesthouses/hostels accept card payment?
 For trains (e.g. Hue to Ninh Binh) do tickets (particularly for travellers with bicycles) need to be reserved a day in advance?
 Are there any parts of that itinerary that you reckon should be skipped given that it&#x27;s January?
 And are there any sights you would really recommend that I&#x27;ve not included? (I&#x27;ve excluded Sapa, Ha Giang and Dien Bien Phu given that presumably it&#x27;s pretty cold (&lt;10 degrees) at this time of year, and I would guess the earliest days of February in Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay can still be foggy, so I&#x27;d leave that for a summer trip, given I only have 28 days). The karst caves at Phong Nga are, I guess, probably tricky to reach on a bicycle too.
  
Cam on rat nhieu.

                              <span>Hey,
 Just wondering about the title.
 From my time I met with a Vietnamese woman. She was married but wore no ring. Said he husband cheats on her but she couldn&#x27;t leave him because it was frowned upon by her family unless she had someone else who could look after her. Even then her family would have to go to his to make the arrangements for her to leave him. 
 Is divorce really looked down upon in Vietnam or is this bullshit?

                              <span>Hi, I currently having to deal with 2 packages delivering to Vietnam. One of them in from USPS departed to HCM city and one is DHL. How long does USPS going to ship to Vietnam? I’ve never seen anyone successfully receive their package from US to Vietnam through USPS. 
 One more package I have is using DHL to ship, from Germany to Vietnam. However the package lost update since November 6 and my seller filed for lost parcel. But on December 15 the tracking was back but it has been stuck in customs since then.
 I don’t know what to do besides waiting, but I know where the package is because it shows me the address where the package is at, can I just go to that address and get my package immediately or I need to wait for the customs and god knows how long. Some said that I need to pay import taxes but I thought that items that are over 2,000,000vnd doesn’t require to pay tax. Does anyone know what to do??? It’s so complicated.

 Hegel was one of a series of German philosophers (including Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Marx) in the 18th and 19th centuries who wrote on the subject of historical and social progress. Speaking very broadly, the idea is something like this: A, society exists in a certain state, with certain rules and traditions and practices. B, the limitations of these rules and traditions and practices prompt a reaction against them. C, the established system and the reaction against it combine to form a new system, informed by both, which then becomes part A of a new cycle. A, ,B and C are often called &quot;thesis&quot;, &quot;antithesis&quot; and &quot;synthesis&quot;.
 Now, you can apply this pattern very broadly, to describe the foundations of epistemology - exploring how human knowledge arises from combining the abstr…</span>

                              <span>Currently in Hue checking out the tombs and the imperial citadel. Weather in Central Vietnam has been quite cold and rainy so far. My brother and I want to do the Ha Giang Loop around the end of this month but reading online, some people say around this time the weather may not make it worthwhile (foggy, etc). Do you think it&#x27;s still worth doing?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been living in Vietnam for a year, and some things about the culture I find genuinely bizarre. 
 Around the corner from my place is a big bia hơi kinda place, and there are always 3 or 4 guys stood in the road trying to flag people down, waving at them, even jumping in front of bikes from time to time. 
 Of course, I&#x27;m well travelled and people trying to stop pedestrians is common all over the world, but vehicles? In my mind, I rarely drive around aimlessly, if I&#x27;m on my bike it means I am going somewhere, why would I go into these places on a whim? I have never once seen anyone stop for one of these people, so... What&#x27;s the point? It&#x27;s just an annoyance it seems. 
 Maybe I&#x27;m missing something but it seems pretty odd.

                              <span>Many people in this subreddit say they teach English, but if you are from a Vietnamese family, what is it like to learn English?
 Possible points to contemplate:
  
How does English compare with tiếng Việt?
 Are you perchance the first, second, or third of your family line to become fluent English?
 Do you use English with your family?
 Did you have to go overseas to perfect your English?
 Has English skill given you notable opportunities?
 Have you had interesting instructors?
  
I am not Vietnamese, but I find it pleasant to talk with Vietnamese citizens and Việt kiều in this forum.

I’ve also emailed them multiple times and they always just say wait 2 business days. It’s been more than a week now. Does anyone know how to reach support, preferably in English? I don’t know any Vietnamese unfortunately. Thanks for all your help!

 I see many Vietnamese be able to calculate and sell and do business really well, it just seems like it&#x27;s a big part of the culture too, to hustle and to work hard on their business.

                              <span>Hi, all! I&#x27;m currently comparing options for Vietnam tours for late February, 2024. There are two that are extremely similar-- same tour company, similar price, almost identical destinations-- except that one travels to Hoi An and one travels to the Mai Chau Valley. I love visiting historical sites and especially UNESCO World Heritage landmarks, but I&#x27;ve read that Hoi An is very touristy and a bit of a let-down for some Redditors. Mai Chau Valley looks breathtaking and a bit more off the beaten path, but I could use some opinions on it from people who have been there.
 Which of these tours would you pick?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m an American-born Vietnamese, Mom came here in the nineties and recently became a naturalized US Citizen. My mom has her original birth certificate from Binh Dinh (pretty old and raggedy at this point lol) and she wants me to find out how to get her dual citizenship/Vietnamese passport. She&#x27;s been thinking about returning to Vietnam to retire soon and be with her siblings who stayed in Vietnam.
 Any other VK&#x27;s here done this before? I&#x27;d love to get details and specifics - A lot of conflicting information online along with just outright confusing info so it&#x27;d be nice to actually hear from others who&#x27;ve done this. 
 I&#x27;ve tried emailing and calling the consulate and embassy in the US as well but they&#x27;ve been surprisingly unhelpful and unresponsive lmao.

                              <span>Hello All! Hope everyone is well! I&#x27;m from Singapore.
 I&#x27;m planning to solo travel/ backpack for the first time ever to different countries in SEA in Jan 2024. Preferably starting from 3 Jan - 16 Jan 2024. I&#x27;m planning to stay in a hostel. Main point of this trip is to learn new culture, explore amazing cuisines, do fun local activities, meet new people, relax, enjoy, take amazing pictures and create awesome memories!
 I think Sapa &amp; Hanoi in Vietnam would be a great choice! 
 What do you think? Anyone can share with me travel tips or where else I can go in Vietnam in Jan 2024?

                              <span>My Vietnamese isn&#x27;t that good and I don&#x27;t know what tax on stocks gains/profit called in Vietnamese to search. Anyway, where can I find information about taxes on these things? Information such as:
  
How many % do I have to pay?
 How can I submit my tax report?
 How often do I have to do this?

                              <span>Im travelling to Vietnam from Sydney, and im thinking of using a Wise debit card and Wise convertion since its charges really low rates (less than 1%) https://wise.com/au/
 Would I be able to use the Wise debit card in Vietnam? I am going to all the major cities in 14 days, I am doing a tour so most of the stuff like accommodation and domestic flights are all already paid but I still need cash to get food and etc.
 Using my regular bank card ANZ or Commonwealth kinda sucks because its 3% conversion rate. What is the best way to get money out from atms in Vietnam?

                              <span>I looked for some guides on the internet about this, but most of them are from Americans or Europeans, and their dating cultures are so different from each other and from Vietnamese that I don&#x27;t think I can learn anything from them. So I really need some insight from my fellow people. Here are my questions:
  
Outside of online dating, how did you meet your gf and ex? Are most of them previously your friends, your coworkers, someone you were already familiar with? Or just strangers you bumped into?
 When you&#x27;re interested in a girl, how do you approach her? My understanding is that you&#x27;d ask her out for a coffee, a milk tea, right? How successful were you? How often did you get rejected? If rejected, do you just move on and ask the next girl you&#x27;re interested in, or do you persist and try again later? Are you usually interested in a lot of girls at once, or just focus on one target?
 If she accepts your invitation for a milk tea, how often did it turn into an official relationship? I mean, is dating supposed to be a numbers game where you repeatedly ask a lot of girls out, repeatedly go out with a lot of girls, just to successfully obtain a gf once in a while (let alone a wife)? I see that most people enter a relationship very easily, so it can&#x27;t be that tedious, right?

                              <span>Hey! ;)
 My Vietnamese fiancée and me (from Germany) will celebrate our wedding in Đà Nẵng next year in early September. We are looking for a band who can perform both Vietnamese songs and English rock/alternative/pop music. We are planning a wedding that will combine both Vietnamese and &quot;Western&quot; traditions - and, of course, our own wishes and visions. 
 We expect around a hundred guests. Most guests will be from Vietnam, but many people from Germany and other nations from around the world will hopefully join. So, it will be wonderful to have people from all over the world to come together, celebrate and connect with one another. We hope a band will be able to play a set before dinner and one afterwards. So, maybe around 3-4 hours in total. Afterwards, we will have a DJ put on some music and we invite the band members to join and celebrate with us. 
 If you or someone you know might be interested, please message me! ;) Looking forward to hear from you!
 All best
 Niko

                              <span>I&#x27;m into listening(podcasts)/watching(YouTube)/reading about murder mysteries/unsolved cases/crime stories. I am Viet Kieu and can understand and speak Vietnamese. I am trying to learn to read/write in Vietnamese. Out of all the stories that I&#x27;ve heard about, it&#x27;s very rare that I hear a story from Vietnam. A few months ago, I heard about Dung Hà (Vietnamese female gangster) and found her story quite fascinating. I was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction (YouTube, podcast, websites, books) where I can learn more stories such as this? I&#x27;d really appreciate it!

                              <span>Hey!
 I’m an American born Vietnamese who would like to re-learn the language after 20 some odd years of not being fluent.
 My mom re-married after immigrating to America and our household was fully English speaking from the time I was 9 so it sort of fell to the wayside.
 I can listen and comprehend okay (still pretty bad) but my speaking is garbage to put it lightly.
 I’ve tried using duo lingo but I think the dialect is mostly northern whereas my family and friends are from the south so that’s what I would like to focus my learning around.
 Of course I can always speak to my mom now but she’s not really equipped to “teach” it so to speak.
 What are some good resources online? Is it worth it to find a private tutor? I know a few viet friends who learned/perfected their English by watching tv, can the same be said about consuming Vietnamese media with English subtitles? Is that even a thing?
 I think my biggest hurdle is embarrassment/awkwardness when it comes to talking, I lose confidence and don’t want to sound like an idiot so it’s hard to stay consistent.
 Any ideas?

 ​
 Is it worth staying in Can Tho for 2 nights, or since we really only have like 1.5 days in HCMC, we should skip staying in Can Tho and just take a day trip?

                              <span>Hello! I’m searching for advice and help, especially from the Vietnamese families. I’ve had my first daughter and wanting to bring her back to Vietnam with my white husband. First, a litttle background, I’ve been isolated from my family in Vietnam for many years because of disagreements between them and my mother. In preparing to go for a month, during Tet, and my mother told me I need to prepare at least $8,000cad to pay for all of my extended family members groceries, outings, transportation and rent for my relatives.

                              <span>Hello! I’m searching for advice and help, especially from the Vietnamese families. I’ve had my first daughter and wanting to bring her back to Vietnam with my white husband. First, a litttle background, I’ve been isolated from my family in Vietnam for many years because of disagreements between them and my mother. In preparing to go for a month, during Tet, and my mother told me I need to prepare at least $8,000cad to pay for all of my extended family members groceries, outings, transportation and rent for my relatives.

                              <span>Hello! Sorry if this is more suited for the sticky thread, but its quite specific.
 I was adopted from Hanoi in 1992 and I am currently visiting Vietnam and Hanoi.
 I wanted to show the adoption clinic to my children but neither me nor my parents remember the address(we visited the facility in 2008/2009). I am aware that we need permission to enter the facility but we only want to see the outside.
 The only information I have is that the clinic was called &quot;B clinic&quot; or &quot;Clinic B&quot; back in 1992 and I believe it was still in operation in 2008/2009. However the name can have changed. 
 Any information is of value as we leave Hanoi on the 23rd of December and only have tomorrow to find and visit the facility.
 Thanks in advance!

 Man, woman, 2 small children. Can&#x27;t recall if the children were helmeted... But left me feeling it&#x27;s a new milestone.... Rather than Migrant workers coming to vn on their own or possibly in pairs, Migrant families living daily life in the city. It felt real off.

                              <span>am at the beggining of a motorcycle trip starting in HCMC and aiming to travel in the length of country. I&#x27;ve loved my time here so far and looking forward to the rest of the trip!
 I bought a motorbike in HCMC, a Yamaha T135, which has served me well the first week. However I obviously wasn&#x27;t thorough enough when inspecting it since I&#x27;ve only just realised the indicators are not orange but blue! I&#x27;m pretty sure its the bulbs themselves since the light housing is clear plastic. 
 My question to those in the know - is this illegal? Will I get pulled over by police as I travel from HCMC to Hanoi/Hai Gaing loop?
 I haven&#x27;t seen any other bikes with coloured indicators so far so a bit worried to be honest

                              <span>Hey fellow riders! I&#x27;m looking to purchase a Honda Winner X 2022 V3 (Red Color/Special Edition/ABS) in Hanoi, and I&#x27;ve heard second-hand might be the way to go. Any recommendations for trustworthy retailers in the city? Also, any advice on what to look out for and the legal procedures for a foreigner to acquire a motorbike in Vietnam? Considering having my Vietnamese wife buy it – thoughts on that? Appreciate all your insights! 🙌

As you can tell, these two places are.. EXTREMELY different. So.. to those who are Vietnamese but don’t live there.. What are some things you guys do that reminds you of Vietnam? Certain activities, places.. Etc..

 Are both usage of “tìm” correct? First screenshot accepts tìm but second doesn’t allow. When should I use “tìm thấy” vs “tìm”?
 Please also explain giúp versus giúp đỡ. Reason is one lesson I Learn it didnt allow me to use giúp đỡ tôi and corrected me with giúp tôi. Why is that? Does đỡ modified the word giúp? 
 Thanks. Cảm ơn.

                              <span>My coworker is an older gentleman who fought in Vietnam. He keeps a lot of pictures and memorabilia of his time there. He’s not sure where this picture came from, its relation to the Vietnam war, or if it was even taken in Vietnam. We couldn’t find anyone who knew how to translate it as most Asian Americans we asked said it wasn’t their language and even if it was they don’t read only speak. We think it’s written in Vietnamese but someone told us it was Chinese. Any ideas?

                              <span>I will be proposing to my girlfriend on December 25th in Hanoi! This will be after we have finished driving the Ha Giang Loop. I’m hiring a photographer off Facebook, but need a good private beautiful location. Ideally we could hire a florist to prepare it in advance with flowers / candles. Does anybody have recommendations?

                              <span>For the Saigon to Sydney flight, at the boarding gate, after security VietJet lies to your face that there is a hundred millilitres restriction on any liquids you have purchased or filled up inside the terminal for flights to Australia
 They don&#x27;t tell you at check-in either, just with security officers at the boarding gate. So if you&#x27;ve purchased liquids in the terminal they will confiscate them.
 If you ever have the chance, please let them know that they are full of shit, because we just checked with Australian Biosecurity here and they have confirmed that policy is an airline policy even though when you are boarding the plane they claim it is an Australian policy.
 Probably just trying to force you to purchase their cash only in-flight beverages.
 F*** VietJet.
 Edit: To be absolutely clear, we are talking about an additional restriction at the boarding gate, not the normal security check where we all know liquids must be surrendered. This applies to all liquids purchased in the terminal after security screening.

                              <span>Hello. I’m coming out to South East Asia the end of January and was wondering how much Ha Giang gets effected by the burning season. My plan was to do Thailand first(chiang mai before burning season) and then hit Vietnam in late February/march. Now I’m worried Ha Giang(what I want to do most) will be low visibility due to the smoke. Is February/March a bad time to do Ha Giang with visibility?

I was quite surprised by her views on relationship and marriage and so I was wondering if she is a successful/known/famous author in Vietnam.
 Moreover, if you have good Vietnamese authors to recommend to me do not hesitate!

                              <span>Took the bike over from Nha Trang today to check out what looked like a cool stretch of coastline. I could see from Google maps that there was a load of resorts along the stretch of beach by Cam Ranh airport, but it just seemed so surreal driving around there! Surely none of them are ever anywhere near capacity? We saw nobody around apart from workers who were mostly just chilling out outside of the gated resorts. Are they laundering projects? The upkeep must be so expensive. Does anyone know what it was like on this stretch of beach before they were all built? Just curious!

                              <span>Hi, I didnt know where to post his but I hope I can get some answers.
 I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. I have read multiple places that Phu Quoc is overdeveloped and does not give you that &quot;island life&quot; feeling. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
  
Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :) Thank you for all answers!

                              <span>Sorry for the rant. But some of the public colleges and primary-high schools in HCM City keep setting back the GODDAMN TIME in which morning classes start. The old time usually was 7:15 or 7:30am, then it back to 7am, and now it become 6:45am (Some schools like HCMC University of Industry and Trade set to as early as 6:30am)
 When asked about this decision, 2 of the most popular answers from the school speaker are: - To avoid heavy traffic --&gt; They seriously thought &quot;If the traffic is usually jammed at 7am, then why don&#x27;t we just start the school at 6:45am?&quot;. To me, this is such a dangerous one-sided thinking, which disregard students whose houses are very far from school. Doesn&#x27;t even mention student now even have less time for breakfast anymore if they wake up at 6 o&#x27;clock or later. Plus, people who don&#x27;t want to deal with heavy traffic are already aware to get up early, you don&#x27;t need to force everyone has to go more earlier, as long as they go to school before it starts.
  
To prevent student from coming late to class and to encourage them to wake up early--&gt; There is no scientific research stated that the earlier the school start, the lower the student coming to school late. School in US and Europe begin at atleast 8 am so student can have good sleep, which they&#x27;ve done countless researches before. Again, dangerous one-sided thinking to me. As a grad student, I have twice to tripple amount of assignments despite sleeping less comparing to my time in high school. From my experience, it encourages more people to go to class late lol. My friends said this is dumb, and they ended up always going late or only go to second class (8:30 - 10:10am).
  
Sorry if you find this rant and broken English annoying. I&#x27;m 2nd year grad student and I&#x27;m tired of waking up in 5am so that I can take buses in 5:40 to get to school in time. The reason I wrote this post so I can relieve some stress from constant complaining against my school. Hope you forgive me.

                              <span>I&#x27;m 24 and a local here (hcmc, vietnam). I found 2 great friends in real life from this sub reddit and wanna test my luck this time. Also, my roommate/best friend is getting married so I&#x27;m feeling a bit lonely idk 😕 About me: I play games but not so good with it, just average I think (LoL, Valorant, CSGO, DST, overcooked etc.). LGBT+ friendly and open minded (I do know that some ppl do claim that they&#x27;re but they actually dont but this is what ppl around comment about me so I think its reliable 😂). I&#x27;m not so good with recommending cool food places cuz I mostly order food to my house 🥲 Good hidden bars, coffee shops yeah I can do. I read manga and watch anime too but wouldnt say I know many good ones. I draw as a side hobbies, not so much recently but yeah I do love art. Have tattoos, I can recommend some good tattoo artists that I mainly go to here. I have depression, anxiety, bipolar and a bit of adhd (thats a lot isnt it 🤡) but Im highly self aware and well put together most of the time. Last but not least 😂 I&#x27;m a libra.

                              <span>I am a white guy visiting my wife’s family in a pretty rural part of Vietnam. Our sleeper bus stopped on the way and I went in to use the urinal taking the first empty one (there was probably 50 urinals mostly empty). Some guy comes in right after me and takes the urinal right next to me, then proceeds to just stare over the divider at my junk very obviously for a good 20 seconds. It was very obvious since he peaked his entire head over the divider multiple times. Eventually I gave up on peeing and left to use a stall cause I felt too uncomfortable. Any advice on what I should do in that situation? Do you say something or just walk away like I did? Is this common?

                              <span>Sorry if this is not the right place to post this but I just want to get this off my chest to s community like this. For some context I was born in Hanoi and adopted into a US family at 8 months old - I have nothing as far of information regarding my parents, just my birthday and where I was found abandoned. I got the chance to visit Vietnam for the first time in 16 years since I was born last month. I got to experience the city and the wonderful people and I got to go to my orphanage. I got back to the US just 2 weeks ago and I just miss Vietnam so much - part of it just feels like home to me and I just miss the whole vibe and general culture of the country. I have never traveled to a place where I just felt so in place and “normal” with people who were genuinely interested in me and cared about me. It honestly was an experience nice and feeling that I really cannot put into words. I am not normally a person to express my emotions like this but I just had to get it out somehow sorry this was more of a post about my feelings and more about myself 😅. Anyways thanks for reading - sending love ❤️.

                              <span>Arrived at Tan Son Nhat and called a GrabCar to my hotel in District 1 since it was 100k vnd opposed to the 300k-400k vnd quoted by the taxi stands.
 After a few minutes trying to find my driver in the parking lot at the Arrivals exit, he helped load my full size luggage and medium totebag into the trunk while I carried my pet carrier with me into the back seat.
 About 5 minutes into the ride, the driver motions a hand gesture towards his tummy and realize he is trying to say he has a stomach ache and needs to find a restroom en route. He gets on his phone and coordinates with another driver to take me in their car instead. We stop at a gas station, and I get out with my pet carrier and begin to get into the other car. My driver opens the trunk to retrieve my luggage, closes the trunk lid right away and holds up a 100k bill to show me as he hands it to the new driver. I am in agreement as it seems fine with the exchange of funds to the new driver, and I pay the first driver once my ride completes.
 As I am about to enter the new car, I realize I am missing my large totebag. I tell my original driver, hey I&#x27;m missing my other bag. So I go over to the car and he opens the trunk and reaches in and retrieves my totebag. I see the totebag is placed in the trunk in a small, recessed area that just seemed odd. I didn&#x27;t think much of all this at first, but at the end of the day, this incident has kept me thinking I was trying to be robbed. My totebag contained all my essential items.
 tldr: grabcar drivers says he is sick minutes into a ride, gets me a replacement car and driver and forgets to transfer all my luggage to new car.

                              <span>Hi, I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
 Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :)
  
Thank you for all answers!

Bản thân em thì công việc cũng ổn định, có 1 khoản tiết kiệm khoảng 400tr, nuôi 1 bé mèo. Cũng lâu rồi em không yêu đương gì nên thấy độc thân cũng quen. Hồi xưa đi học còn hơi hướng ngoại nhưng giờ cuộc sống chỉ quanh quẩn đi làm rồi về nhà, đi ăn với bạn thân, dần dần em lười bắt đầu một mối quan hệ mới luôn. Cũng không phải là không có ai tán mà thực sự em không có hứng thú luôn ấy ạ (mặc dù e vẫn là gái thẳng). Không biết có chị nào từng giống em mà cưới chồng rồi có thể cho em xin lời khuyên được không ạ? Em cảm ơn.

                              <span>I sorta want to learn to read and write chữ nôm, and that would requite me to learn Chinese. What dialect would I learn? Before the arrival of the Jesuits and French, Vietnamese was written in chữ nôm, which were Chinese characters modified to write Vietnamese. In order to read and write this script, one probably had to have a good understanding of Chinese. But what dialect of Chinese did chữ nôm writers speak? It probably was not Mandarin, as that was spoken in northern China, ~2000 miles away from Vietnam. Chinese rule of Vietnam ended in the 10th century, so there must have been some drift in the Chinese dialect the literate Vietnamese knew and the dialects the Chinese spoke.

 Hi all, does anyone know of a platform similar to instacart in Vietnam? I&#x27;ve heard of shopee (not available to download in the US), Lazara, and tiki but I believe they are similar to Amazon so I&#x27;m not quite sure about quality control (there are reviews of course). For context, I&#x27;m based in the US and would like to get groceries for my relatives in VN once in awhile. TYIA!

 My partner and I are visiting Vietnam and we are currently in Hanoi. Last evening we were walking around the Hoàn Kiếm area, when at some point a man seemed to have offered us something (I did not hear/understand). I have simply politely responded &quot;no thanks&quot; and my partner and I continued walking. From that point, I could see from the corner of my eye he was walking behind us. We did not interact further. At some point, he passed us and was now ahead of us by a few steps. Whenever we stopped (to look at our map, cons…</span>

 Do you think it&#x27;s impossible in my case to get a job in Vietnam? What about the visa?
 I am a French Software developer with 3 years of experience, both in France and Germany.
 I am fluent in English and French. I know that recruitment policies rightfully prioritize locals, but I would appreciate your opinion about this topic! or even some feedbacks.
 Thanks for your answers :)

The accusations of racism.
  
Whilst it is true that Vietnam is a racist country, I find it absolutely ridiculous that people seem to be stereotyping the entire nation as being racists. I myself whilst not exactly dark skinned, have seen a lot of darker skinned Viets living life normally. Matter of fact- a big majority of Viets are tanned, regardless of class.

                              <span>I&#x27;m driving home with my girlfriend, it&#x27;s pretty cold up in the mountains so we try to get back as quickly as possible. On the way, we see a bike lying on the side of the road. I immediately stop and see two kids (maybe 17-18) lying there in a puddle of blood. I stop the bike, jump off, and run over to them and notice that one kid has two huge holes in his head and his face is completely covered in blood. The other kid is alright, just a scratch across his face from the pavement, but visibly shocked trying to shake his friend. Some people are standing in the distance just looking, while his head is lying on the side of the road.
 I hold his head up, his blood is pouring all over me. I try to wave to people passing by, and every single person stops, looks, shrugs, and keeps going. Not a sin…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I have tried drugs pretty much from every class. Weed, traditional psychedelics, stimulants, dissociatives and sedatives. I have experience with relatively high dose of shrooms and LSD, also with vaping and smoking DMT. I&#x27;m familiar with the feeling those all share to some extent. I have done high dose of edible cannabis multiple times too.
 Tonight I was alone in a bar in Vietnam and a guy asked me to join their table. I joined them and we enjoyed some beer and tried to have a conversation even though they didn&#x27;t really speak english. They had a shisha on the table and offered it for me and I smoked it few times. It was my first time doing shisha, everything seemed just normal, it tasted like mellow strawberry. Bar staff was taking care of the shisha so I believe it was just an or…</span>

                              <span>I’m currently in Hanoi, and a friend managed to buy a Grab jacket for me as a souvenir during my last trip.
 I know it sounds weird, but I figure other tourists have tshirts (which I do as well), but buying a jacket is unique, and it really reminds me of being in Vietnam.
 My friend is refusing to help me look for a BE jacket this time; he says it’s the “uniform of the poor”.
 So, I’m on my own on this endeavour. How would I buy one, despite not being able to speak Vietnamese?

 What would life be like in VN with this amount of savings at a relatively young age? Thanks for any advice or perspective.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in vietnam for over 2 weeks now and I&#x27;ve been really depressed about the racism I&#x27;m facing here. To give some context, I&#x27;m chinese and indian, quite dark skinned, female. 
 The counts of racism I&#x27;ve faced here is absolutely disheartening, maybe because of my background, I tend to notice the implicates of it. Other - I&#x27;ve been really well behaved, trying to break the misconceptions about my countrie(s) not because I deliberately want to, but because that&#x27;s how I am. I&#x27;m introverted, am always polite, tip well, do not indulge in the bad stuff. 
  
At the hotel I was in, I saw white tourists get upgraded and also an Asian Australian man get upgraded (their original rooms were not available). In my case I was asked to wait 3 hours for my room, when I asked if I could pay for a better room, they happily obliged. This happened on the same day, around the same time. 
 
Customer service - Specually in hotels again, I saw how other customers were treated over me. Unfortunately, I did notice a theme going around with the skin tone. I saw a couple who came in after me order much more elaborate dishes, it was only after they finished almost eating, was I served my very simple dish. 
 
The cherry on top, I took a tour to a popular tourist guide with a English speaking tour guide, he went on to speak about how brown skin is not considered beautiful in vietnam, that it&#x27;s ugly, relates to poor and bad behavior as he himself was brown, he did not have good experiences in vietnam with his love life, job etc.. this really broke my heart. This country is supposed to have the kindest of people, having read the previous threads too, I didn&#x27;t expect to have this experience in Vietnam of all places. 
 
 I just wanted to share this with all the people of colour who keep asking this question if the vietnamese are racist. Here&#x27;s your answer. Ofcourse, it&#x27;s not as blatant, or direct, but hurtful nonetheless.

                              <span>Hi,
 I wondered if there was anyone from Vietnam able to forward some products from Lazada through to the UK - at a fee, of course - it is just some T Shirts! 
 Thanks!

My first destination will be Da Nang and I’m not sure where to stay there because I have seen one of the posts in this channel is about how bad the hotels are in Vietnam. I am planning to stay in Da Nang then will head to North towards Ha Long. Any recommendations would be perfect, thanks folks!

We booked an Airbnb but we’re only allowed to check in by 12 NN. I was wondering are there any 24-hour spots in District 1 where we can stay while waiting for our check-in.
 I’d love to hear if you guys have other tips for us on our situation. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey, so Im a 17 yo german/viet guy and will travel to vietnam for some time and I was wondering how you would actually make friends in vietnam, especially people my age. 
 So my vietnamese is really bad thats why I will probably just stick to english, the question for me is, how widely spoken is english in vietnam these days? Can I help people trying to learn german? Are there any social activities I could participate in? Any tourist spot recommendations?
 Any answer is appreciated!

                              <span>Hello.
 I m european and i will travel to Vietnam by plane to sign on container vessel, i m a seafarer. I have in my checked luggage a 2.5kg sealed bag containing GymBeam True Whey ( protein powder ). One friend of my father scared me and told me that custom agents are very corrupt and if they see that I m european, they will demand money and if i refuse they will even go far as replacing my protein powder with some drugs to convict and jail me. 
 I told him that he s crazy but now i m a bit worried. Can i take my protein with me or should i leave home. I would probably come by plane from Instanbul or Doha.

                              <span>I’m 29f getting engaged to 30m, we’re both Vietnamese but my side does not know anything about this ceremony and his side wants to do it. Everything is mostly taken care of except we don’t know the step of how everything will play out, and supposedly we need a representative to speak and read out the schedule for the day, which we have no clue. Like do I wait with the bridesmaid to accept the gift from the groomsmen or do I stay hidden? Do I serve them tea after? And then his mom give me jewelry? Does anyone have their dam hoi day schedule so I have an idea

                              <span>Alright, first of all, I&#x27;m a Vietnamese. Using English here, because well, why the hell not?
 University in this nation just feels forced. Not like &quot;conscription&quot; stuff but, keeps organizing random events and forces students to participate, and if not, deduct bunch of &quot;diem ren luyen&quot; or whatever. I just feel like students should have the rights to whether to go or not. Like recently, my university had some sort of Shoppe-sponsored event and of course, to make the sponsors happy, they force every students to attend, standing in the sun for 1 hour then listen to annoying love-related songs about bunch of &quot;I love you then you dump me&quot; non-sense. Or forcing students to clean up construction debris in the university. Wow, unpaid working. 10/10, Law university. And upcoming, another sport event that if they didn&#x27;t threaten to deduct points, probably no one would attend because 90% of the students aren&#x27;t bothered to wake up at 8AM in Sunday, just to watch bunch of fellow university students playing badmintons and running.
 I understand the morality behind the non-sense of that points system, for &quot;đánh giá về phẩm chất chính trị, đạo đức, lối sống của sinh viên trên năm mặt đánh giá&quot; but using this so that the teachers can prove that &quot;my university organizes events and the students are totally not enforced to come and this will do very well for publicity&quot; is not really a good excuse to use this points system. Because some university students have their own life to deal with and should not be forced to participate in events that for a lack of better words, they don&#x27;t give a f- about (there&#x27;re defo better words). Just because you can do something doesn&#x27;t mean you should. Students have their own life and you having free time doesn&#x27;t mean you should torture the students.

                              <span>So I am a Vinasun or Grab user usually but my colleague got me turned onto this new Vinfast vehicle based service and it’s now hard to go back. These cars are new, clean, and don’t have plastic on the roof…always wondered what kind of bloody crime occurs in these taxis that a plastic lined roof is necessary…
 Anyways, what are your thoughts? Anyone else enjoying this new service?

                              <span>I’m going to vietnam next week and I went to search up on items to declare while clearing the customs. One of the items is cash.
 Apparently vietnam customs allow you to bring $5000USD or equivalent foreign currencies in cash without a need to declare. But for their own currency, they only allow travellers to bring in 15million VND which is $620USD equivalent. Anymore than 15million VND in cash has to be declared. That is so weird? Anyone has any experience of bringing in more than 15million dongs in vietnam? Do you actually need to declare? If you did, what did they do? Do they just straight up confiscate the difference?
 Edit: People seem confused so I’ll explain further: 
 Guys I am talking about arrivals. Not departure. I’m BRINGING IN 30million dong cash to vietnam to SPEND. I’m NOT BRINGING VND OUT of vietnam. I dont understand why would they limit the bringing of their currency that’s the most legal and accepted to be used in their country so severely. It’s like they are trying to create more business for the money changers there.

                              <span>Is it just me or have you noticed the same. It seems to me that the driving style in Vietnam seems to be slower then for example in Thailand or the west. I don’t know how to describe it. I felt the same in Laos. Some sort of socialist driving style. Maybe it is also because there are so many motorcycles and most look identical. What’s your take on it?

                              <span>Can there be widespread development and well-being in a socialist country like Vietnam?
 Vingroup seems to me to be the classic case of parastatal corruption. They promised to build homes for the people by converting rural areas but then built luxury homes that are inaccessible and currently empty. 
 It seems to me that in VN no one cares about voting and that all they have faith in the government. 
 It seems to me to be a country destined to become a new China if the people do not demand democracy and the fight against corruption. 
 At today we never saw a country without democracy grow up with a stable well-being and in my opinion VN people they need to fight more for their rights.
 What do you think? Why Vietnamese trust this gov?

                              <span>How much should an insurance company pay for the following: 
  
Outpatient treatment 
 Inpatient treatment 
  Medical evacuation to my home country 
 Repatriate remains
  
Is outpatient coverage necessary here as treatment in Vietnam is super cheap? 
 How long should the waiting period for cancer or illnesses? Some insurance companies have a 12 month waiting period for cancer which is ridiculous in my opinion. 
 Thank you so much

                              <span>Husband and I will travel for 2 weeks starting from SGN and end in Hanoi from February 28- March 13th. We were thinking of taking the train up the coast and stopping off at Sapa, Nha Trang, Hue, and still deciding. We like to adventure, eat good food, and not be in touristy scenes if possible! Where we else should we definitely stop and where have you stayed that you enjoyed? Ok with private rooms in hostels, hotels, other unique experiences. Should we book ahead of time or wait til we get there? Thank you 💞💞💞

                              <span>Been here for a while now and I am honestly SO tired of being misled by top tier hotel reviews online that turn out to be rigged or fake. Every “well-reviewed” hotel or accommodation (even higher end ones) I’ve stayed in was so terrible (or subpar at best) despite raving reviews online which leads me to believe it’s all fake and manipulated. 
 Then, whenever you leave an honest review or comment on booking.com or google that isn’t a 9 or 10, hotel staff will literally track you down on your personal whatsapp or e-mail to emotionally blackmail you urging you to delete or edit your comment, or worse! They will even threaten you! 
 Pictures on websites are insanely misleading too and idk why but staff always give off this insanely fake vibe with weird fabricated personas they sport because they they think this somehow pleases tourists? (Spoiler: IT DOES NOT, everything just feels pretty off and not genuine at all).
 All very exhausting. I’m leaving Vietnam soon and couldn’t be happier to leave this all behind me. 
 Sorry I just had to rant for a moment after countless disappointing experiences.

                              <span>Going on a business trip to Ho Chi Minh in April. Never been to VN and I like food. Been to other parts of Asia but VN has been a goal of mine someday. My plan was to find a market and just go for it. I will literally eat anything at least once. 
 Everything I read on this sub looks delicious. Just any tips on what I should do are appreciated. I’m not just going to eat pho or Bahn Mi. Things with fresh herbs and noodles/soups are interesting to me. I like spice and not American guy spicy. I don’t need to eat meat with everything. 
 I have a weekend to explore. Thanks I appreciate it.

 What is the best way to prepare the pork at home? My mouth is watering actually typing this.

For some reason I just can’t get my feet to be flat. Not sure if it’s because I’m a kid and still going through puberty but 🤷‍♂️

                              <span>Hello friends! I created a facebook group for those who are interested in pursuing surrogacy in the US. This is something that is new to Vietnam but many International parents come to the US for surrogacy. 
 I created this page and I hope to post information for any who are interested. I am Vietnamese American so I do not have many connections in Vietnam to share this page with. 
 If you know anyone in Vietnam struggling with fertility, please share this page! 
 I cannot link it for some reason but the group is called “Mang thai hộ tại hoa kỳ”

                              <span>I purchased a suit a dress 2 dress shirts and 6 pillowcases all made with a silk blend fabric as well as 2 100% Silk scarves. The first price I was quoted was 6 million and I talked them down to 4.8 million. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m not fine with the price I paid even if it was overpriced I&#x27;m just curious how well I did bargaining and if I got a good price as at the start of my trip I was overpaying like double at minimum for everything and haggling is a brand new concept to me as a Canadian. Please let me know I&#x27;m curious if I got any better!

                              <span>I’ve been to like a dozen of shops in Hanoi checking: - if they provide tax refunds - what their prices are
 I’ve done it so you don’t have to :)
 Turns out every shop has slightly different prices on Apple products.
 ShopDunk has both the lowest prices AND provide tax certificate so you can get your further 10% off at the airport.
 I paid 9.9M VND for an Apple Watch S9. After tax rebate it’s 9M, about 25% cheaper than I’d pay for it in the UK.
 iPhone 15 works out at around £800, so 20% cheaper than in the UK.
 As far as I can tell there shouldn’t be any regional differences in hardware or software, albeit Apple warranty isn’t international as far as I can tell.

                              <span>As a foreigner, I wish to get the general perspective of Northerners and Southerners. I have lived in Hanoi 7 years and had spent 8 months full time last year in Saigon. As the title suggests, I am genuinely curious as to why? Granted Saigon has been renamed as Ho Chi Minh City, and some suggested it some sort of a reminder to everyone. Is this really the case? I also met people who still refer to the city as Saigon. 
 It does not mean I don&#x27;t see him in Hanoi, just not as much as in Ho Chi Minh City.

 She gets upset about things to do with her parents back home in veitnam, but when I ask about them, I get told not to worry about them. 
 Been with her for nearly 2 years, and married since January. I could understand the general secrecy if it were a relatively new relationship, and kind of has expectations that the secrecy would kinda die off after a few months, but it never did.
 There&#x27;s a whole bunch if questions, that I could never get answers from her on.

                              <span>Question
 Why do so many Vietnamese feel the need to come right next to you when there are so many other spaces. 
 Example: - I&#x27;ll be in a cafe that is totally empty and a noisy Vietnamese family with kids come in. There&#x27;s a 99% guarantee that out of all the empty tables, they&#x27;ll choose to come and sit right next to me.
  
Motorbike parking will be totally empty but I can guarantee someone will park their bike right next to mine (and bang my mirrors while doing so)
 
I&#x27;ll go to the park to relax while it is mostly quiet. Despite being empty, the one group of Vietnamese will almost definitely come and sit right near me. 
 
 Is it a deep rooted fear of being alone or just a desire to piss off other people? (Joke)
 The urinal meme has never been more true.

                              <span>I visited Vietnam for a month to go backpacking with my father. We traveled to Hanoi, Ninh Binh, Meo Vac, Dong Van, Cat Ba and Ha Giang. It was an amazing trip and I learned so much about my dad and what his goals are in life for his next chapter(s). 
 The people of Vietnam were so welcoming and so very kind. The country is beautiful. Thank you for welcoming me into your country during my travels. I can’t wait to come back. ❤️

                              <span>I&#x27;m from the UK and we queue for everything lol especially in shops but while travelling SEA I&#x27;ve noticed a good few times where I&#x27;ve been standing waiting in a queue and a local has just walked infront of me and not even acknowledged it just acts like I&#x27;m not even there. This morning I was getting a train in hcmc and wanted to double check everything was okay with my ticket there was someone getting help when I arrived at the customer service desk and 2 people behind me so very clearly in a line and an older man walked infront of me and then after that it happened again with another older man. Being from the UK and how we queue this is seen as being very rude but is it a common thing here?

We&#x27;ve loved staying at that hotel and we&#x27;re always very respectful so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s not anything we&#x27;ve done but is this normal?

The sappier/siller the better cause lbr, the owl (which is where I&#x27;m starting to get a grip on things) is going to teach me the basics but not how to call my wife the love of my life, my angel, sweetheart or something equally or more romantically ridiculous 
 What do you say /r/VietNam? Help a hopeless romantic out?

                              <span>I got trc. So I am qualified for public health insurance. 
 I like my public hospital. It is cheaper than the private hospitals. 
 I recently bought cheap private insurance here in Vietnam and they rejected my claim. 
 The sales rep for that insurance lied to me about my insurance coverage. Due to my budget, I had to buy this private insurance. 
 My current insurance company will not cover for pre-existing conditions. 
 My employer only gives me accident insurance. They do not give me health insurance which sucks. 
 I do not drive. 
 Outpatient is cheap here. 
 My budget is tight so I wanr to save as much money as possible. 
 I am wondering if public health insurance is enough. 
 Do I need to still buy private insurance in addition to public health insurance? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, when I was very young my neighbor used to come back from Vietnam and gift us silk pjs and gold bracelets. They were my favorite pjs, just simple shorts and tank tops. Obviously I out grew them. 
 Now that I’m adult and traveling to Da Nang I’d like to buy some. I don’t care for them to be tailored, it’s just a pj. I’m looking for a nightgown, short and tank top set, and maybe a robe. And maybe some gold jewelry if it is affordable.
 Are there shops I can buy this already made? Any store/address recommendations? Even if I go to Hoi An, I only have time for one day so they would have to make it same day by 7pm. 
 Thanks kindly!

I want to try it out, but they say on the Internet that legally a thing of this nature will not be allowed through customs, otherwise you won’t end up with problems. Has anyone already encountered similar “problems” and is there a way to get the desired item while in Vietnam?

                              <span>I know Vietnamese are pragmatic and that chữ quốc ngữ is way more practical for everyday use, learning and teaching. Nevertheless, I wonder how the Vietnamese state, the society and individual are interested in their Vietnamese cultural heritage. Do people offer it at school like how many western nations may also offer to teach a dead language like latin? Do people use it for modern poems and literature?
 What I personally love about Chinese style characters isn&#x27;t just the aesthetics, but the connection and meaning that each character holds. They don&#x27;t just decorate the temples and literature of the past. For example, did you knew that the family name Ngô 吳 does not refer to maize/corn 玉米 , which is also called ngô in Vietnamese? I did not for a long time. I think the usage of Chinese characters can make some differentiation in phonetically same sounding words and its kinda neat.
 I also find concepts and attempts like Quốc âm tân tự and chữ Nôm mới very interesting.

 2 days Hanoi
 2 days Cat Ba
 1 day Hanoi
 2 days Sapa
 2 days Ninh Binh
 1 day Hue
 2 days Hoi An
 I got 6 more days and I need to end up in Ho Chi Minh City for the flight home. What would you recommend?

 My name is Thanh (F) and it&#x27;s weird that I can&#x27;t find any soulmate on dating apps. I keep searching but seems so impossible haha. So, I want to take a chance to introduce me on Reddit, hope to find a companion 😉. As I always get busy with heavy workload and meetings, I have no time to prepare myself. Moreover, I am surrounded by married guys and LGBT guys in the office environment, so.. yah.

 I have been existent on Earth for 24 yrs. I just turned 24 a few days ago. Before, I&#x27;d never thought that It would be necessary to date and get married to someone. Recently, I&#x27;ve healed from childhood trauma by myself and I realized that I do need a companion in my life.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m wondering how expats living in Vietnam handle their health insurance?
 I am moving to Vietnam soon for work (my employer does not provide health coverage), and I plan to take out some travel insurance initially to cover any accidents or emergencies, and then find a health insurance plan provider after I arrive. Not sure if this it the best way of doing it though.
 Does anyone have any recommendations or advice? I&#x27;m interested to hear how you insure yourself and which providers you recommend.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I just had the worst train experience in my whole life. I and my friend went to buy the bunk beds for our 7 hour trip. The toilets are too filthy as they pissed all over it and there is not enough space, it likes you are locked inside a cramped closet with piss filled every fucking corner. The train shaked and as it stopped it almost made me fall into those piss filled corner in the toilet. The noise I could endure but there was a family with little kids who kept kicking the wall during the night. The staff smuggled people so they can charge 10$ per bunk bed while when we officially bought the tickets it was 30$ per seat. As we only bought 2 seats, the 10$ illegal bought beds above us hung their feets right above our head, kicking in the beds so we could not sleep for the whole night. And the train staff, seeing that we realized she smuggled people onto the train and felt we bought our beds so she couldn&#x27;t make anymore money, treated us as garbage and was being rude the whole ride. I doubt they ever change their attitude or service so I won&#x27;t ever get on a train in Vietnam for my long ride anymore. It was not worth it. I was very tired and both disgusted and angry with suck an awful train service.

                              <span>I was walking around Saigon exploring random convenience stores in Tan Dinh and D3 between meetings, and noticed how most western branded goods are priced almost as much (if not more than) as they would sell in the US. 
 ​
 Products like Cerave, Cetaphil, St Ives, etc are all priced at US levels, which is something I&#x27;ve never seen in other Asian countries. In China or India, Unilever or P&amp;G would try to match local prices, but in VN they are completely unabashed in price gouging. 
 ​
 While I do understand that these would be luxury products for most Vietnamese, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen this lack of price localization almost anywhere in the developing world.

 This is an old performance by someone who is not Vietnamese. The caption is in Russian, but I was able to translate it via Google Translate. The part pertaining to the lyrics state that she sings the following:
 &quot;It’s wonderful to love like this in the spring, when the expanse of fields blooms. The valleys turn green again, the nightingale captivates with the song. Leave me, leave me, I’m in a hurry to go to the market. I won’t hide it, I love you, but it’s a pity I can’t stay... &quot;
 The caption goes on to say that the song was created it back in 1957, when the performer participated in a tour of Vietnam as part of a delegation of Soviet art masters. It states that she is wearing the national costume donated to her by the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture.
 I am curious if the song is accurate. Is she really singing in Vietnamese? I don&#x27;t know enough to be able to tell myself. Thank you.

                              <span>Hello all!
 So I’m in VN for a few months and don’t have much friends yet with similar interests. I do love going to experimental music places and raves back in Europe. Something that I would do with friends mainly and also alone. I’m born European and so know the culture and social codes even in underground spaces.
 So now that I’m on my own here in VN for ths first time ever, I found a bunch of parties I would like to attend, at locations for example: The Observatory, Arcan and The Bar Commune Lab.
 Now all my europe friends are like ‘you should NOT go alone,cause its dangerous to do things alone as a cute female in a third world country’ and in the meanwhile all my friends who are from south east asia themselves, that I met in Europe, are excited for me te explore on my own in VN and make new friends by just showing up here.
 So, what do yall think? Can I go around on my own? Ofcourse a lot of basic female going out things apply like, dont accept drinks from strangers and stuff but idk, I dont feel like Vietnam is that unsafe and these spaces seem experienced when it comes to internationality?
 My viet language is super beginner tho..

 I was talking to my coworker about houses in China, and he said that Ho Chi Minh District 1&#x27;s prices are ridiculous, given that for the same price (let&#x27;s say 500k), you could buy a 1500 sqft house in let&#x27;s say, Columbia MD, where many people agree is a good place to live.
 Or a 3000 sqft house in Sugarland TX, which let&#x27;s face it, is amongst the best values for money in America given you get a top rated school system (according to USNews), being in a rich and educated community, and having quite good weather rather than hot/humid weather even in the winter and tropical diseases.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m solo travelling and I&#x27;m looking for a nice place to stay from 12/12 - 10/01. After a month of hard work I really need to rest and I&#x27;m looking to just sit and dive on a beach.
 I was searching for Phu Quoc but came across some threads saying it&#x27;s all fake and overpriced (?). Do you recommend it or not?
 I&#x27;m not looking for party or busy places, just something chill, where I can walk to some beaches, have a beer and maybe rent a bike to explore the surroundings.
 Alternatives are destinations like Phuket but it seems the weather is not so good there now.
 The only thing to keep in mind is that I need to work, so good wifi is mandatory.
 Really appreciate your help. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all, I can speak Vietnamese well enough to be considered fluent (although I don&#x27;t have the largest vocabulary) by virtue of it being my mother tongue, but I&#x27;d love to be able to read and write better.
 I can somewhat read stuff based on the words that I see, but I have a lot of trouble with identifying and applying the accents on the words. Conversely, I have even more trouble with writing.
 What&#x27;s the best way to get started with learning how the accents affect the words?

                              <span>Hi, I am currently in Vietnam and plan to do the Ha Giang Loop from 12/19-24. I have come across multiple posts discouraging booking a guided tour. I am currently riding from HCMC to Hanoi and rented a bike from Tigit. They have an interesting option where one can rent a guide for $140 a day (plus all expenses for the guide). I was maybe thinking if anyone would want to join, we could split the cost of the guide and have our own smaller tour. This would not be an &quot;easy-rider&quot; situation and you would have to ride your own bike. Tigit also rents bikes and gear for a fee. Link below for the guide. Thank you.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I’m making a second post in hopes to find a wedding dress shop. I’ll be going to Ho Chi Minh soon and I would love suggestions for shops that sell wedding dresses. I’m looking for a modern, off the shoulder straps, satin ball gown dress. Thanks for your help!

 I came across articles claiming that a 2.5-year-old baby can read numbers and speak English, even though the child is Vietnamese and hasn&#x27;t been exposed to an English-speaking environment or received any formal teaching. My dad believes it 100%, but I&#x27;ve mentioned that it might be for marketing or a gameshow aiming to attract more views

                              <span>It&#x27;s kind of weird seeing all this talk about &quot;western&quot; stuff in this sub. Some people here toss around this strange idea of &quot;western&quot; and it just feels way off to me. It&#x27;s like &quot;western&quot; only accounts for the image of the USA. As a German, I don&#x27;t feel represented by that concept at all.
 Germany and the USA are worlds apart politically and culturally, despite both being tagged as &quot;western&quot;. Alone in Europe there is so much cultural differences.
 And then there&#x27;s the comment sections, turning into what feels like an active war. You got one group throwing a bunch of untrue, mostly negative stuff about Vietnam, and another group firing back with a pro-Vietnam vibe while dissing &quot;the West&quot;, saying so much stuff that basically only applies to the USA.

                              <span>I was wondering if I could maybe get some clarification here about something a colleague told me. So a bit of background information: We both live in the Netherlands he goes to school here and says he has both a Dutch and a Vietnamese passport and he is now 18. But he told me that when he was 17 he needed to go to Vietnam for mandatory military service for a year and that he was a Sergeant-Major. Is this even possible because from what I could find you can only start service in Vietnam when you are between 18-25 and I doubt that becoming a Sergeant-Major is easy. So is he telling the truth or is he just telling some made up story for some &quot;clout&quot;?

                              <span>I’m curious to hear from those who grew up in Vietnam. Is corporal punishment still seen as the most effective way of child rearing in Vietnam?
 I grew up in the USA. My parents are both in their late 60’s/early 70’s, dad spent a couple decades as a POW. I was routinely beaten and kind of grew up resenting it. More often than not, they were unfair and often was due to a misunderstanding. I had thought that part of the reason was his years spent in prison, but apparently this was just how he was. When I had vented to my aunts and uncles about it, they specifically told me a story about my dad beating my aunt when she was 8 because she accidentally dropped a christmas light that shattered (he’s between 10-15 years older than her, for reference). I remember seeing my aunt sitting there being …</span>

                              <span>I will be travelling to Vietnam two weeks from now and I just found out i’m pregnant. For the record, I didn’t initially plan on coming there to get an abortion I just want to spend Christmas. But its here now and I see Vietnam legalized abortion and would love to get it while i’m there. 
 What’s the name of the best clinic that can assist me? and any idea with the cost. Thank you.

Does anyone know something about him? Does the owner release him for the time the station is closed? It was heartbreaking seeing the dog locked in that tiny cage. What kind of life is this?

                              <span>Hello, need advice.. is April a good month to visit all of those places? I know north and south have different weather so im trying to figure out which is the most optimal time to visit if i wanna a do a trip from south to north. Ive just been to Hanoi a few weeks ago but unable to visit Sapa because the weather was not favorable and wasnt able to do the Ha Giang Loop tour bec i had limited time, so on my next trip i want to cover those as well as Hoi Anh and Hue. Thank you in advance for the advice. 😅

 Is it a good idea tho? Are the dentists in big cities good?

                              <span>Was in District 1 the other night, around 8pm in the vicinity of Pham Ngu Lao when a dude walked past, wearing a wifebeater vest and nothing else. 
 Another time, I rode through Tan Binh probably around 10pm when there was a dude completely naked and playing with himself at the side of the road. 
 In both instances, neither traffic nor pedestrians seemed to even bat an eyelid. In other countries, people would be alarmed or shocked but in Vietnam it didn&#x27;t even warrant a second glance. Is this something normal or are people just too afraid to do anything?

                              <span>Sorry to be another tourist asking about Ha Giang.. I was hoping to go the first week of February, will it be burning season by then? I am seeing some mixed information as to when it starts, but I&#x27;d really like to avoid it so that the views/air quality aren&#x27;t disturbed. I am aware it&#x27;ll be quite cold at this time

                              <span>Im planning to write an article related to this topic, hence would like to collect your sharing.
 I observe that social media (especially Facebook watch) is definately creating a negative personality of my parents and other middle aged adults in general. I saw them watch several meaningless and no value contents (in many topics, for example: cancer maker (without any verification), some dudes telling you how to live a life lol) then they share to us with the thought that it’s a reference that we should follow and absorb. It’s hard to say but I feel like the social media is changing the middle-aged people’s mental health. I think because they aren’t growing up with the social media like us (late of Gen Y and on) so they are lacking of “pick and choose tools” when using social media. They are the most vulnerable social media users I think. What u think bout this? Let’s share some thoughts or any practical case?

                              <span>I hate over changing currencies so I prefer using card. However, I’ve travelled to cities that do not accept cards totally but I’ve also travelled to countries that don’t require me to use cash at all and I ended up over exchanging. 
 Firstly, I just want to know is Ho Chi Minh cashless friendly ? I’m there for 5 days only to shop, eat and chill. Secondly, My plan is to change 50% of my currency 50% in card. Is that a good or bad idea ?
 Lastly, if they do accept cards are they typically the paywave that don’t require me to insert the card and enter they key?
 Thank u

                              <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;m thinking of buying Apple Watch and would like to ask several questions on how it is suitable for usage in Vietnam for my purposes.
 What I have: iPhone + &#x27;SimA&#x27; and going to buy Apple Watch Series 9 41mm with eSim support (and I put there &#x27;SimB&#x27;).
 - Can I leave the phone at home and go out with the watch + &#x27;SimB&#x27; only and be able to see messages on facebook and Zalo and write/record basic replies (without having any kind of headset)?
 - Can I see/reply to calls/sms which come to &#x27;SimA&#x27; (which is in the phone) when I&#x27;m outdoors with the watch only (the phone is at home)?
 - Can I use the phone to answer calls/sms which come to the &#x27;SimB&#x27; (which in the watch)?
 - Can I use the watch to order grab car/bike and see how the car/bike is approaching on the map?
 - Can I make Sacombank money transfers using the watch only?
 I know that there are Grab/FB/Zalo apps for Apple Watch but I&#x27;m curious how they are actually usable (especially on 41mm watch screen)? Also it is not clear if there is a &#x27;full&#x27; Sacombank app (or Apple Pay support only).
 I appreciate any help

                              <span>Me and my wife where travelling the Mai Chau valley, just enjoying the view, going through the villages. One of the houses was blasting dance music, we went over and saw the locals are having a birthday.
 For some reason they really, really, really wanted us to join them and we figured why not. So we danced a little and they immediately offered us their booze (don&#x27;t really know what it was, maybe banana wine?), we drank one glass but they really really wanted us to drink more, at some point we really had to push them off. When we figured we want to leave they grabbed us by the hands (as if to keep on dancing with us) and they where actually holding unreasonable firmly, one might even call it violently. At the end we managed to shake them off and just wave them goodbye.
 It&#x27;s important to note, the whole settings where very friendly, there where Children, women and elderly in the party, so we don&#x27;t think those guys had bad intentions and do us harm. We do wonder why they where so keen on having us on their celebration and why the hell where they holding so strongly?

                              <span>Hi guys. I&#x27;m traveling vietnam north to South with my vietnamese grandfather for two months. We are currently in hue and I&#x27;m a bit lost. My grandfather is a great guy but spending two months with the same person can be a bit hectic. I am far away from my vietnamese family in the south and further away from my friends and family home. I am looking for someone to explore the beautiful city of hue. Is there someone who wants to meet up?
 Don&#x27;t hesitate to contact me! I&#x27;m a great guy who is just a bit far away from home.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about the opinions of Vietnamese people on relationships. The motivation behind my inquiry is that many of my wife&#x27;s friends have experienced divorce, or remarriage, or are seeking partners with more financial stability than their exes. some of their husbands, who happen to be my friends, claim a common issue of feeling controlled. 
 In contrast, I have been clear with my wife that either of you is free to walk away without strings attached if the relationship reaches a point of no hope.

                              <span>I keep reading on different websites that HCMC has nightlife that almost rivals Bangkok, how it&#x27;s the second biggest party spot in SEA, etc.
 Just got here last night. Bui Ven seems to have more people in the street than the actual clubs and it all started to die down at midnight. Lush was tiny and about 75% empty. Faham just had some small groups sitting down with balloons, Observatory was dead...
 For a Friday night after all the hype I saw online I was a bit disappointed. Am I just going to the wrong places or does Vietnam just not have a nightlife oriented culture?

                              <span>As a true Hanoian for more than 20 years and a foodie, i just want to recommend some good food in Hanoi for some tourist here or any people living in Hanoi should try. These food is must try in this cold winter weather :D
  
Bánh đúc nóng (a snack falty food with rice cake dipped with fish sauce, pork, cilantro, fried scallions) 
 Cháo sườn (pork-ribs congee)
 Bánh trôi tàu ( hot sweet ginger soup, rice cakes filled with sesame, top with coconut and peanuts) 
 Cháo đậu cà (rice congee with fried tofu and salted eggplant fruit): apparently i just know this dish recently havent tried it but its known for a very famous dish for people here to eat in autumn-winter.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m one half of a lesbian couple living in usa. My wife is Vietnamese. We&#x27;re hoping to have kids in the near future and then moving to Vietnam to raise them. How do we ensure kids have Vietnamese citizenship? I will be the one carrying them, biologically we&#x27;re using my wife&#x27;s eggs.
 Please let me know if flair is wrong.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Literally going to Mua Cave in hours to hike and the bunch of stuff you do based on the tour.
 Is it wise to wear shorts in this weather or better to wear shorts because of the hike and cycling?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve been travelling to Vietnam for a few weeks now and loving it so far. I want to have a chilled weekend in Ho Chi Minh City.
 In Hanoi, I loved to chill at Hoan Kiem Lake - I just had a nice time just sitting/walking around there and I found that locals would approach to practice their English with me there which made it extra nice.
 If there somewhere similar in HCMC? I’m in District 1 but don’t mind wandering.
 All suggestions welcome! Thanks!
 EDIT: it doesn’t even have to be the whole day/weekday but is there somewhere that’s just nice to walk around?

                              <span>I collect license plates as a hobby and noticed that I couldn’t find any Vietnamese plates for sale on eBay or any other site, but when visiting Ha Noi I found a shop that sells them. It didn’t seem suspicious or anything, he had them all over the front door as advertisement. 
 I’m wondering why these plates aren’t sold online though since I’ve managed to find nearly every other country’s plates up for sale on eBay

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I will be visiting Vietnam in a few weeks (Dec 26 to Jan 11) and I will be in a group of 3. I was wondering if it is better to book activities, tours, transport etc. in advance or if it would be alright to just book when we&#x27;re over there?
 Mostly just want to know the best way to go about this as we&#x27;re all excited and a little bit nervous and I would like things to go as smoothly as possible!
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious, with how open Vietnam is today and how many people will fall in love across all kinds of identities and nationalities I imagine plenty of folk will be born in Vietnam in a mixed family. Especially in Saigon.
 For anyone with knowledge on this, what í that like? Is there bullying in the local schools? Anything to worry about? What can you share?
 Thank you

                              <span>Why do people keep roosters (which crow noisily each morning before dawn) in a densely populated urban area (Hanoi in this case)? Are they there to sire additional chickens, to be a watchdog for security purposes, etc.? From my and I’m sure 99.99% other neighboring residents’ perspective, it’s just another source of rude, inconsiderate noise (as probably hundreds of people are subjected to it; fortunately I’m not right next door, but I feel for those who are). Or should it be regarded as just another source of local “color?”

                              <span>Hi all, I am visiting my family in Vietnam for the first time in 6 years and I&#x27;m looking to buy them gifts from the US. Besides things like medicine, clothes, and accessories; I would like to buy them something that would improve their quality of life. The only thing I can think of right now is an air purifier to combat the air pollution lol. But since they&#x27;re bulky and are pretty readily available in Vietnam, should I buy it here or wait until I get home? I really appreciate any other gift ideas as well!!

 Travelling tomorrow to Hoi An from dec 1st to dec 4th. I have been following accuweather actively to assess the risk of floods while we are in the region. Seems like it is going to be pretty wet. 
 Where can i see the official warnings issued for the region? Any recommended website? 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi Reddit Vietnam brains trust. Hoping someone can help me out, with quite a specific and niche type question in regards to a Vietnam eSim provider for mobile/cell phones.
 I was in a rush flying out of Vietnam last week. My physical Vietnamese sim cardoesn&#x27;tnt support global roaming.
 I need a local Vietnam number (eSim only as I&#x27;m not in Vietnam atm) to receive calls/text messages while overseas (ie needs to offer global roaming capability).
 Seems the majority of eSim providers for Vietnam, don&#x27;t offer global roaming + local Vietnamese number. 
 Zalo, Skype and Viber are the less preferred options, as I need to be contactable on a local Vietnamese number.
 Think I&#x27;m out of luck and will have to use alternative methods, till I&#x27;m back in Vietnam. Unless someone on here can help.

 Hi! I’m new to the community but would like some help choosing a name from the members of this sub!
 I am a 2nd generation Vietnamese-American with both parents from south Vietnam. I have gone through many names during my time of being kinda out as trans-masculine and all of them have been either generically white male names or just English words. I’m hoping to legally change my name soon to something more permanent and closely tied to my culture. I have been immersed in Vietnamese culture and tradition ever since I was a child but when I was born I was given an American name instead of a Vietnamese one. I used to be grateful for this because it reduced the amount of bullying I got for being Asian but now I just want a name that connects to the culture and people that raised me.
 I’d just like some suggestions from other Vietnamese people on male names :) I’d also accept and consider just object names! I used to go by Zero at one point so I’m no stranger to non-name sounding names lmao
 Thank you in advance! :D

                              <span>I recently had a wonderful journey to Vietnam. As an expat in Thailand driving regularly there it seemed to me that the traffic in Vn is more ruthless and unforgiving especially when crossing a road. My Thai wife simply refused to cross when she saw the circumstances. Is this lack of experiance?

                              <span>This accident happened about 10 meters in front of me today and in real time. Probably a 3-4 year old kid standing on the motorcycle with both his parents sitting in front and behind him, and as always, he wasn&#x27;t wearing a helmet but the parents were.
 The dad driver did a close maneuever to overtake a public bus but probably forgot about the son standing right behind him. Consequently, the kid&#x27;s head collided with the side mirror of the bus, causing him to lose balance and fall off the bike. But lucky enough, he fell AWAY from the bus or else it would be a much bloodier scene.
 I don&#x27;t get this, you can afford a bike, you can afford two helmets each for yourself and your wife, you can afford clothes, you can probably afford a smartphone as well, but a child&#x27;s helmet crosses the line? Here&#x27;s an unpopular opinion, if you can&#x27;t financially &amp; mentally afford a child&#x27;s helmet, then you probably shouldn&#x27;t have a child. Don&#x27;t even get me started on letting your child stand on a moving bike. It was a cringey horror scene but I kinda felt like it should happen more often for them to finally learn.

I&#x27;d like to go to a rural village/ serene place for 2 days before NYE. I&#x27;ve looked into Can Tho and the floating markets look interesting. Any recommendations on places to visit in the country side?

                              <span>Hi all,
 First of all, my situation:
 I&#x27;ve been living in HCMC for almost 2 years now but I&#x27;m thinking of leaving. My reasons are the high rent, the noise and air pollution, and the traffic.
 Rent here is the highest in Vietnam I think, higher than in Ha Noi I&#x27;ve been told.
 About noise, I tried lots of places and honestly outside of &quot;luxury&quot; high rise appartments, other places are affected by noise at night or early morning to the point of being unlivable. I got really depressed once because a place a rented had neighbours arguing all day, karaoke and loud drunk talking at night, funerals,... 
 About air pollution, it&#x27;s worse these days, I can see smog most time I look outside from a high enough floor.
 Traffic is also getting worse. I came to HCMC right at the end of COVID quarantine so it was somewhat normal then, then it got gradually worse. 
 Now my question: I&#x27;m considering moving to another city, probably Da Nang. Is Da Nang really better in terma of rent, noise, air and traffic? I&#x27;ve been there once and think it&#x27;s better but it was just a short trip so I&#x27;m not sure, heard some stories about karaoke in Da Nang so I want to hear more from everyone.

                              <span>Decided to finally visit Vietnam and booked a ticket on Expedia Starlux to Taipei and then last mile with Vietnam Airlines to Ho Chi Minh City.
 Do they automatically transfer your checked bags or do I need to run and go get it and recheck to the other airlines?

                              <span>Am I being scammed somehow ?
 I just moved into a studio apartment in D1 in HCMC. Got a decent price: around 7.5mil per month. Just a small bedroom and bathroom, no living room or anything. 
 I wanted to check the electric meter outside my room so I turned off electronics and it wasn’t moving. So far so good. 
 I don’t use the fridge , so it’s been off the whole month. Most of my electric usage is for my A/C that runs about 12 hours per day. Otherwise the only other electricity I use is for charging my laptop, or my projector if I’m using it (rarely).
 Electric bill comes in at the end of the month a staggering 1 million vnd! I speak to a neighbor from the house next door. He says he’s paying around 400k for the entire house! 
 Now I know the price per KW is 3.000 vnđ, but the landlords make a profit by charging 4.000 vnd. So I’m thinking that either my A/C is super congested and using up a ton of electricity or my landlord is somehow screwing me. 
 Any thoughts? I will be talking to him about this issue in 2 days when I pay rent.

                              <span>Hello Vietnam!
 Sorry for another travel post but after reading through the sub, and watching videos I figured making a post may be the best method since I have some unique elements to my inquiry.
 I spent most of the year working on a project that took a lot of my time, it wrapped in November but I have quite a bit of vacation to use up now. I&#x27;ve always wanted to go to Vietnam. I was in a LT relationship that recently ended and so that factored in with the work leave is making me think now may be a good time however, it&#x27;d be a solo trip and pretty spontaneous due to time.
 My travel window would be likely Dec 8 - 21st. Outside of the US, I&#x27;ve traveled to Asia three times (Japan once, Korea twice). I did solo travel to Japan but I knew very basic Japanese and don&#x27;t know any Vietnamese.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m going to Vietnam in a month, I&#x27;m from Italy so EURO.
 I have Curve, Revolut and BBVA and none of them charge me for exchange fees or atm withdrawal abroad.
 I&#x27;ve read though that in Vietnam every time you withdraw from an ATM or pay with a card you are charged an extra ~3% fee from the Vietnamese bank. Is that so?
 What&#x27;s the most convenient option? Is exchanging EURO at the airport the cheapest option?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m from New Zealand and learned recently that the Cham people speak an Austronesian language, which is the same linguistic family as Te Reo Māori from NZ. 
 What I&#x27;ve also noticed is that Vietnamese seems to have some loan words from the Cham language, like:
 Eye - mắt - mblak (Cham). Mata (Māori) can mean face, but may sometimes refer to eye, eyebrow, or looking out. The Cham word for face is also mata.
 This - này - ne (Cham) - nei (Māori) (usually used as tēnei, but also by itself, like in ā te pō nei (this night).
 There are quite a few more that I found.
 Because of these similarities, could there be more of a Cham influence on Vietnamese than I thought? Is it common knowledge that the Cham language has influence on Vietnamese and vice versa?

                              <span>I am a textile sesign student and recently I have been making patterns based on Vietnam&#x27;s Tet Nguyen Dan and one of the prints contain the fruits present in Mam Ngu Qua. I had been using a book to figure out what all fruits can be added (as main or substitutions) in it and it mentioned figs as one of the substitution that can be added on the tray and it stuck with me and I made a design with that as well. Now I found some websites that claimed figs are not used at all and its making me nervous as I don&#x27;t have enough time to remove it from the design before I am to showcase the collection for marking. So before I chuck it out of my collection, I thought I should come here amd ask you guys. What do you think I should do?

                              <span>I have started making my own Vietnamese drip coffee at home, but I am not sure of the “proper” way to brew. Sometimes, a vacuum is formed from the heat and condensation and seals the lid shut, causing the coffee to not drip into the cup. Am I supposed to break the vacuum seal? Do I just leave it for 10-15 minutes until the temps drop and the vacuum breaks on its own? Is a vacuum seal supposed to even happen?
 Sorry, I am new to dripping my own coffee. Please don’t flame me!

The scammer told him that he needs $2000 for an operation. As kind hearted (and somehow gullible) man, my uncle sent $2000 on the spot. And he is one of the poor relatives among my family. I feel so bad for him. I feel so sorry for his family. His wife works day and night for a clothing factory with really bad conditions and he is a construction worker in Vietnam. Can someone help me and tell me how I can help him? I only have this one information of this scammers bank account.

                              <span>I am planning a trip to Hanoi for 2week trip in march. I plan to have some luxury stays and some very minimal cheap stays to get a feel of what I can bare. I am getting tired of US politics and crazy events lately. I want to learn more the resilience and beliefs of Vietnamese and maybe Buddhism. 
 Ultimately I want to see if I can be retired snowbird in Vietnam Jan-April or live in the region (Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, ect..). I am 53 and healthy and athletic. I raised two wonderful adult ladies and separating from a controlling spouse. I want to be free and take someone that we can mutually take care of each other. I want to connect with authentic people/community that support each other and live a less complicated life.
 I am a Korean migrated to US and I never felt I belonged. I look Korean but white in the inside with my upbringing. I am looking back now and want to meet people like me. Think differently, feel, love. I am looking for friends to hang out and eat and go to clubs. New connections that will pull me back to Asia and feel at home. 
 Question 1. What would be better than Hanoi for value for money compared to other Asian cities. 
 Question 2. Do you find it&#x27;s easy to make good authentic friendship with travelers and local people? Is it easy to date and any advice on best way to find activities with other singles wanting to connect in Hanoi. Connect and travel together?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;d like to learn Vietnamese but I don&#x27;t know where to start. I have no prior exposure of the language or country whatsoever so I really am clueless about Vietnamese culture. However after doing a little research I found out that people are divided on what the standard dialect of Vietnamese is. Google articles say the standard dialect is Northern Vietnamese but will also tell you that you should learn the Southern dialect instead and materials that teach you the Northern dialect I&#x27;ve noticed are kind of frowned upon. I really have no idea what these mean Which sounds stupid I know but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll take the time to learn. Does it really matter which dialect I will learn between those two? Are the differences between the two dialects really that noticeable to the point of miscommunication? I also noticed that learning Vietnamese is also not as accessible as learning other languages like Chinese or German so if anyone has/know any free resources to learn Vietnamese then I&#x27;d appreciate if you&#x27;ll share it in the comments... Thankss

I haven&#x27;t driven semi-automatic yet, but it looks easy enough to learn. I&#x27;m wondering, since the Winner has 6 gears, is it any harder? I only drive around the city and am in traffic a decent amount...I&#x27;ve heard fully automatic bikes aren&#x27;t great for busy areas. Let me know if you have any advice, xin cảm ơn. ^^

                              <span>Hi, everyone! I hope you are all doing well. 
 Me and four other family members will be travelling to Ho Chi Minh this December. May I ask which street or district is ideal to stay at for the duration of our tour? 
 Also, I would like to know some recommendations for a 3-day tour doable by people ranging from 18 to 68 years old. I hope you can help me out in this tour. Ideas about the public transportation access will also be helpful. 
 Thanks so much! Looking forward to your replies! :)

                              <span>Our family of 5 adults will be flying into TSN airport from Seoul mid-December (as part of our trip from the US). Has anyone experienced the priority immigration line and whether it is worth paying for it (we already have our e-visas)?
 It seems to me that the priority line is mainly for aircrew staff. Do these immigration line &quot;fast-track&quot; services &quot;bribe&quot; immigration officials so customers could use that line also?
 I&#x27;ve also heard that the line closest to the priority immigration line (heard towards the left) tends to be quickest. Has anyone experienced that to be true?

                              <span>Chào mọi người,
 The wife and I want to go to vũng tàu soon. I&#x27;m Người nước ngoài, and she&#x27;s originally from Vietnam but grew up abroad, where we met. We now live in Vietnam.
 She remembers Vũng tàu public beaches with food vendors, beer vendors, chair vendors, etc. I&#x27;ve been to beaches like this, and while you always need to watch yourself from getting ripped off, I enjoy having the option to buy some food and drinks from people coming up right to your spot on the beach and the variety of stuff that they might bring. She remembers it fondly too. But I&#x27;ve read that the govt has possibly restricted vendors from these beaches? Is this true? And are there no beaches that have these vendors? We&#x27;re trying to plan the trip and I can&#x27;t find any real answers can someone help me?
 Nước ngoài translation:
 Tôi (người nước ngoài) và vợ muốn đi du lịch ở vũng tàu để đi biển, đi chơi, ăn hải sản, v.v... vợ tôi nhớ vũng tàu có nhiều người bán đồ ăn, bìa, thuê ghế ở biển. Tôi đã đi biển khác mà có người bán, và tôi rất là thích Những mà, tôi mới đọc mầ chín phủ không cho phép người bán trên biển nữa. Có đúng không?.
 Sorry if that Vietnamese gives anyone heartburn. Thanks for the advice!

                              <span>Finhay is an investing app that my wife and I came across a few years back. The interest rates are about 2% higher than traditional banks. We put a fair bit of money in it, collected nice interest, and used it to pay off our mortgage. As we start building up our savings again, we are questioning whether to continue saving money in Finhay at higher interest rates (~8%) or to put it in traditional banks (~6%), which of course have risks of their own in Vietnam&#x27;s relatively wild west financial system.
 I&#x27;d love to hear any insight you all have on the safety &amp; risks of Finhay. Thanks so much!

                              <span>Em năm nay lớp 12. Và cũng đến lúc chụp kỷ yếu. Nhưng em có 1 vấn đề đó là em ko muốn đi chụp với tập thế lớp do có 2 yếu tố. Thứ nhất, em thấy giá cả chi phí cao so tình hình kinh tế nhà em. Thứ 2, đó là em ở lớp ko thích mấy thành phần(ích kỷ, nói xấu,...). Nên em lên đây xin ý kiến mọi người ạ. Em cảm ơn rất nhiều

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;ve been listening to a really beautiful song I came across on spotify, &quot;còn yêu em mãi&quot; by elvis phương, and I was wondering if anyone could translate it for me properly (all of the lyrics). I feel as though google translate makes it lose its essence
 Edit: I&#x27;d also love to know more about the depth of the words that had been used. So in case there is something special about the vocabulary, grammar and so on, I would absolutely appreciate some explanations. I&#x27;m ready for a vietnamese &quot;lesson&quot; :)))))

                              <span>Hello some friends and I are staying in Halong Bay in February and were wondering if anyone had any recommendations for two day overnight cruises that also visit Ninh Binh. Seems like from looking online most of those are three days but unfortunately we can’t do that. Additionally, most of our group are fluent in Vietnamese. Thank you!

                              <span>Flying into Saigon on 12/28, wondering if i should commit 5 nights there and stay for NYE or do 3 nights and fly out early on the 31st to Da Nang and just party there. Honestly with the wife so some fireworks and a nice fun vibe would be cool. Just not sure if its worth to stay 5 nights in Saigon just for NYE when the caves and mountains in the north are calling.

Unfortunately, the Ninh Binh police hang up on me as they do not speak English. Is there an email address or hotline that could help me with this ? It drives me mad knowing this man is walking around without worries doing the same to other women. Also, I have videos of him running away from me, but guess those are unlikely to help unless there are cameras on the streets showing his face. Thanks for your help

The usual ones on the street cafes I believe are Robusta? Those are the ones I really like, and do it Vietnamese style, with condensed milk 😅😅😅. At the moment I use Trung Nguyen S but I was wondering if there are far better ones I could buy in Ho Chi Minh ☺️ thank you ☺️

These are gifts to family members in Hanoi. I&#x27;ve heard stories of people having to pay fines because custom officers at Noi Bai will think they&#x27;re for resale. Is that still going on or is she going to be fine?

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 I am 21F from the US and planning my first trip abroad and intend on it being to Vietnam. In school I learned a lot about Vietnamese history which caused me to want Vietnam or China as my first location and I settled on Vietnam. 
 Because it’s my first trip I want to be able to spend without much worry shopping and food wise. And be in a semi nice/clean hotel. I also intend to hire a Vietnam local to help with navigation, translation, etc. so a few questions. 
 How much should I budget for hotel? Any suggestions?
 How much should I budget for shopping?
 How much should I budget for bribes/transportation?
 I plan to travel to a popular city and more “normal” aka less touristy city if you have any suggestions. 
 I also plan on paying my guide/new friend around 7 mil vnd each week (plan to stay for 1-3) and I’m not sure if this is sufficient based on the current economy, I would pay for all food, transportation, etc while they are with me. 
 Any other travel suggestions as an early 20s female traveling alone in Vietnam is welcome and thank you in advance.

 It sounds humourous to me, given that he is also quite old, and it draws similarity to Joe Biden, whom also gets called lú by Trump fans as well.
 What is the story behind the infamous name Trọng lú?

 hê lô mí bồ
 tui đang cần tìm các từ đồng nghĩa hoặc cách nói khác của “(không) quan tâm”. ko phải quan tâm theo kiểu chăm sóc mà là quan tâm, để ý những điều người khác nghĩ hoặc nói
 hiện tại tui đang có những từ/cụm từ sau:
 để ý, để tâm, để bụng
 mặc kệ, để ngoài tai, kệ xác, kệ mẹ, kệ bà, kệ mợ, bơ, bơ đi mà sống…
 tui vẫn cần tìm thêm, càng dân dã hoặc càng trẻ trâu thì càng tốt. tui cần tìm nhiều và đa dạng chứ ko cần đúng ngữ cảnh nên có từ nào mí bồ cứ liệt kê hết giùm tui nha
 chỉ có là ko được trộn tiếng Anh nên là mấy cái như đ&#x27; care hay đếch care là hong được. với là tui cần tìm cách nói khác của từ (không) quan tâm chứ ko phải câu thoại thể hiện thái độ không quan tâm nên là cũng ko phải kiểu “nhún vai và nói ’tưởng bố mày quan tâm à?’“
 thanks mí bồ
