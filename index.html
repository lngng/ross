She told me to keep it on the windowsill until it&#x27;s warm enough to plant it outside and to keep the dirt moist. I did as she told me and the plant did well the first couple of days but now it&#x27;s starting to wilt and the leaves changed colors, got paler. She also has no idea what I did wrong. I didn&#x27;t find any help on any other forum so I wanted to ask here, maybe someone has more experience with this plant.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m asking this with utmost respect and hope I&#x27;m not offending anyone! I&#x27;m writing a play including a male Vietnamese character, and I don&#x27;t want to pull a JK Rowling, so I wanted to ask actual Vietnamese people if that name makes sense and could be used.
 Yen Hao is supposed to be the first and middle name, Dong the surname. I know that with Vietnamese names, the surname usually comes first. But my play takes place in Czech Republic, and from what I&#x27;ve seen, Vietnamese people around here usually use the Czech order of names (so given name(s) first, surname second).
 If the name is incorrect, I&#x27;d be very glad to hear alternatives! He&#x27;s based on the character of Yevgeni Dorn from Chekov&#x27;s Seagull, so I&#x27;m looking for a name that sounds vaguely similar, although it&#x27;s in a different language. Thanks for any help:)

If you don&#x27;t like it here then why would you be living there huh? It&#x27;s like the prime example of internet toxicity. Update: Yeah I looked at the replies and then looked at my post again, I do sound like a bloody hypocrite kek. Pardon me if you had to go through this kind of post. I&#x27;ll try to, keep it to myself next time.

 Does anyone know how to?

                              <span>My friends of mine recently came back from their business trip in Australia. They said that normally most of the shops close at 6-7pm and on weekend most of them are closed. I was kind of surprise hearing this, I also asked my friend living in Canada and he confirmed the similar thing. They all agreed that it was boring to live there. But for me, I feel sad for Vietnamese people who has to get up early to work or stay late to work too. I said to my friends, we are poorer so we spent all time in a day to work. They close shop at night and on weekend so they have quality time for them and they are not really obsessed of making money. What are your opinions on this, from outside and inside VN people?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have been in Vietnam for a week. Since getting here, my phone has gone from working essentially the same as back home (The US) to dying more quickly than charging when plugged in (it only actually charges with the phone turned off), and dying very quickly when not off the charger. When put into airplane mode and with no wifi connected it seems to deplete more slowly. 
 These are my guesses as to what is going on:
 a) the combination of charger box and charger cord I have are weak, I should try and find a stronger cord
 b) I am using Verizon&#x27;s international plan and don&#x27;t have a SIM card yet, so having my cell service and mobile data turned on is killing my phone. 
 I will go out and buy a stronger charger today and likely be getting my SIM installed either today or tomorrow. 
 Are there any other problems that could be happening based on anyone&#x27;s experience that I could be missing? It&#x27;s starting to make things quite challenging so I&#x27;d love any ideas as to how to help!

                              <span>I am a sole us citizen. I plan to gift money to my extended family in vietnam, about $65k. I know they have chase and citibank branches in vietnam. Can I just deposit money to my chase or citibank checking account and make a withdrawal when I get there? Or are the branches not internationally connected? What might be the associated fees?
 I do not have any work visa, id be just visiting, I dont think I can open a vietnamese account to transfer money to.

                              <span>Hi there!
 I am curious about how buying property in VN works? I am a British Born Vietnamese with the possibility to get a VN passport as my parents were born there. I am hoping to one day relocate to VN and was wondering how the process works?
 If anyone has any experience purchasing as an expat I&#x27;d love to know more about the process and it would be highly appreciated!

Trúng gió - for example perplexed me for years.. usually they relate this to family members getting sick from being outside or exposed to wind. From my understanding, it is the western equivalent to catching a cold. Maybe for older folk who have health conditions should be worried, but people are outside in wind all the time, yet it&#x27;s spoken about like a death knell waiting to happen to you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for three weeks and have yet to see someone who appeared to be homeless. Nor have I seen anyone with visible mental illness (schizophrenia, etc).
 In all that time I&#x27;ve also been approached only once by someone who was asking for money (we&#x27;d call it begging where I&#x27;m from.). 
 What&#x27;s the deal? Is it tight familial structures that keep people from being homeless or is it the state taking care of them.

                              <span>Hey, I was extreme curious about Vietnam, so that I decided to spend my full 2 weeks of vacation to travel down from Hanoi to da nang. Initially I planned to come here around eastern, so the beginning of April, but due to projects at works I needed to postpone my stay by 3 weeks.
 Now I arrived in Hanoi and it’s extremely cloudy / gray and the locals told me that this is the weather I need to expect for the next 2 weeks.
 I was wondering if I should fly down to hoe chi minh and then travel up to da nang.. cause that’s where my flight starts to Cambodia (my next stop)

                              <span>Apologies if this is a silly question but I’ve been in Vietnam for a month and keep being told it’s a communist country and I obviously see all the iconography everywhere but I haven’t seen much actual evidence that the economy is actually centrally planned. Are the major corporations owned by the government like china? Are most personal assets owned by the government like the USSR? What in policy actually makes it communist?

                              <span>Hi, some guide from my origin country said that it is very likely to get robbed in daylight, get your bug cut off or phone grabbed. Is it true? Sounds like a boomer stressing bs but idk. Other stuff i should be worried about? We are a couple traveling, 26f and 30m, western looking. Thanks :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for two weeks now and it&#x27;s an amazing and beautiful country and culture. The only thing I&#x27;ve been disappointed with has been the weather. I love sunny days no matter the temperature and I&#x27;ve looked at the forecast multiple times to see &quot;sunny&quot;. But not once has there been any blue sky. Is this smog or something else?
 Also I&#x27;m in Sapa at the moment and cannot see the mountainous backdrop due to this haze which is very disappointing.

                              <span>I visited the island of Phu Quoc 8 years ago, and returning there this week, I was shocked to see how much it had been transformed, particularly with the creation of a gigantic fake European ghost town in the south of the island, and a pseudo attraction park in the north, where young Vietnamese can be seen parading in Venetian dress and singing opera. Everything seems far from the Vietnamese culture. I am also shocked by so much money spent when Phu Quoc clearly suffers from a lack of hygiene and waste management. But I may be influenced by my European culture, so I would like to have your opinion on the matter.

 For me I think the best by miles is Sriracha(probably biased cause thats most of what I had all my life)
 Chin Su seems more salty than spicy.

But I have no idea what it means or where it comes from? From what I translated its land owned by Uncle 7?
 I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this for me. Does anyone know the origins of this username/nickname? Is it a reference to something specific or just a made-up name? Any information would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Chao Anh and Ems, Im a Viet born in Sweden in the early nineties. Probably one of the most foreign subgroup of VN people and if you ever meet one you know we are weird af, hopefully always in a good way tho. People say I dont even look Viet (In Vietnam) , but I know I&#x27;m at least 4 Nguyens generations deep and Ive been visiting my great great grandfathers tombs out there in the jungle, so I should qualify!
 But as far as Vietnamese people and culture go we are useless! We understand Vietnamese in a weird way like only spoken Vietnamese and it should be in a specific context like when you are angry af, it&#x27;s very selective. And it helps if you sound like my parents, if you have different dialect then sorry không hiểu gì hết!
 I have decided to change that and start hiểu that part of me, Ive been visiting Vietnam (mainly HCM), for a few weeks at the time, for a couple of years now. And guess what my language improved a little bit! This last year Ive visited more than 12 weeks, and the idea of relocating doesn&#x27;t seem too crazy to me anymore, and actually at this stage of my life kinda makes sense, its a great challenge for me personally, and I honestly feel a little bit bored and in some ways limited here in Sweden.
 So whats my problem, just move!? Well If could just move I would but I need to find qualified work first. Im a software engineer working full-stack with a couple of years experience. Im already looking at some standard stuff that might fit me through regular channels e.g. linkedIn, and I will keep looking there. But its a jungle out there, for a guy who doesn&#x27;t know the job market over there it all could be a hit or miss. 
 Hopefully somebody here has been in a similar situation and can share their experience or have any good insights, or even better set me up! Help a brother from another mother come home!

                              <span>We&#x27;re a couple in our mid-thirties planning a move to Vietnam this September, and would love your opinions on which city would suit us best. We love food, culture, music and easy access to nature/green spaces (inside and outside town) above all. Our party days are not over, but we gravitate more towards conviviality than blind drunkenness, and would love to create connections with locals and not just foreigners :) 
 Pros and cons of both cities in relation to the above?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>does anyone here of viet descent experience “asian glow” or the facial redness/shininess when you drink alcohol? i have a very low tolerance and can’t digest alcohol and every time i drink i get red like a tomato. but i heard that it’s kind of uncommon in vietnam/SEAsians and more common in chinese or koreans🤔does anyone here get this condition too? is it really rare among vietnamese people as i was told?

What is a trustworthy place in Saigon to get an iPhone and has somebody experience with getting a VAT Refund when flying out from Saigon? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello. I will be visiting Phu Quoc in a few days, and I heard that the city is famous for its pepper.
 I&#x27;ve been to Phu Quoc before, but that time I visited a place called King Kong Mart, and there were so many pepper brands that I didn&#x27;t know which one to buy.
 If there are any pepper brands worth buying, please recommend!

 What would be the equivalent at a Starbucks for example? 
 My coffee knowledge is terrible so I have no idea where to start?!!

                              <span>I don&#x27;t like the chili sauce factories in Vietnam because the flavor doesn&#x27;t taste authentic. I usually make homemade sauce, but it&#x27;s best with soup rather than dry foods like sausage or fried chicken. I&#x27;ve found that habanero chili sauce is much better. Therefore, I want to distribute habanero or ghost pepper chili sauce in the Vietnam market. Do you think this is a good opportunity? thanks

                              <span>We are here travelling for a few weeks and stumbled across an amazing and fascinating scene yesterday, hoping someone can clarify what it was
 We walked around a corner near the lake in Hanoi to see a group of people shouting and frantically unloading these giant fish (I think they were carp) out of the back of a motorbike. There was a lot of flailing arms, flailing fish, commotion etc as they quickly grabbed and tossed all of the fish into the lake. Some of the fish were massive, so slippery that they were dropped onto the floor and ushered into the water by land.
 A security guard then blew his whistle and they all quickly started praying/meditating, before jumping on their bikes and riding away.
 It was pretty fascinating to watch and our best guess was that it&#x27;s related to a buddhist fish ceremony. 
 Are we correct and does it happen a lot at Hoan Kiem lake? Where do they likely get the fish from if so?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! I’m planning a trip through Vietnam and want to visit a rural village while there. I especially would love a place with rice paddies.
 I’ll be traveling from Hue -&gt; Ha Long Bay -&gt; Hanoi (flying out of Hanoi). Maybe there are some cool rural villages/farming areas en route between those places?
 I had my heart set on Sapa, but I don’t think I’ll have the time to go that far north from Hanoi :(.

                              <span>What plug types are used. Google states A, C and sometimes F. I have A and C, do you think I need to purchase F for typical 3 and 4 star hotels across Vietnam? Thanks for your help. Very excited to visit.

                              <span>Hello everyone! Please let me know whether this question is appropriate or not for this sub.
 I just wanted to ask if anyone here has used the Wise (formerly Transferwise) travel card in the country as a tourist? I currently live in Japan and plan to convert some money to put onto it but I’m worried about being able to use it to withdraw cash at local ATMs (as it’s my first time visiting the country and I hear most places will only take cash).
 I heard Agribank has the lowest fees (and a reasonably generous daily limit on withdrawals) so I was considering trying to use the Wise card to withdraw cash from their ATMs. Does anyone know if this will work? 
 TIA!

                              <span>I’m looking for recommendations for a town or city on the coast for my father (64 year old English speaker) to spend two or three months. He’s looking for somewhere cheap to rent and a affordable. Not too built up tourist area as he has a limited income and not great vision. Through my own research and brief visit I thought Hoi an might be appropriate spot but I’d really appreciate any suggestions from this group. If this question would be better suited somewhere else again let me know. A million thanks.

                              <span>Literally asking for a friend as I think this is entirely stupid, but is it possible to buy 10 to 20 thousand dollars worth of gold bullion with a credit card. Specifically, do gold shops accept amex in vn?
 It would need to be bullion so they can stick it up their ass or whatever and smuggle it wherever they are going. 
 I have to ask as it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d ever think of but it&#x27;s exactly what they want to do....

                              <span>This community has been a huge help so I wanted to share my experience with getting voice and data on my iPhone 11 in Ho Chi Minh City. 
 I did not get a Sim at the airport because of a post I had read earlier about someone having problems with there sim. 
 Instead I used the airports Wi-Fi to order a grab and then walked to a viettel dealer the next day which allowed me to explore the neighborhood. ( don’t forget to bring your passport 😬)
 I got a 30 day prepaid plan with voice and 4G LTE data for 170,000 VND which is 7.24 USD I have no idea how many gigs I get but I use it to FaceTime my friends and parents and listen to Spotify. Might hotspot if I get this online teaching gig but I’ll keep my 🤞. Anyways…
 (This doesn’t include the 60,000 VND it cost for the grab rides to and from the Viettel store because I had forgotten my passport at the hotel. 😂)
 I did walk a total of 4 miles that day and felt pretty amazing afterwards so it was worth it 🙃🥳
 I look forward to the weekend and exploring District 1. So far the people here have been awesome and I really feel welcomed!

                              <span>HI everyone! I am currently studying engineering in Australia and I have to design a housing community in a Vietnamese village called: 
 Bình Thành, Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam
 Now the scenario goes this way, In this village lets say there was a natural disaster recently and I have to construct a housing system for 75 families that will at least last next 3 generations. 
 Regarding this i would highly appreciate if you can answer my question. Even great if someone&#x27;s originally from there. 
  
what are the typical housing system there?
 what about common disaster that i have to take in account
 family structure?
 environmental advantages and dis advantages 
 what if i was to reconstruct those family&#x27;s near a flowing water supply like river/ canal...would it be possible or logical? 
 hospitality of people among themselves?
  
That&#x27;s it for now. Please, any sort of help I&#x27;ll really appreciate: paragraphgs, artcles, images(even greater) but anything is fine. Thanks a lot.

                              <span>Hello people of r/Vietnam!
 I&#x27;m travelling to HCMC next month and looking for local music venus where they invite indie, alternative, rock or techno musicians. I only recently found out the hidden gems thanks to Saigon Supersound.
 I could find some conventional clubs or bars but they don&#x27;t seem to care much about music but only attract thousands of uninteresting tourists.
 Any insider&#x27;s information about clubs, cafes, bars, concerts or music festivals are much welcomed. If you know communities, websites or magazines that&#x27;ll be also awesome!
 I&#x27;d appreciate your recommendation or tips on how to explore the local underground music scene.
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>I’ve been traveling for a year and just spent 2.5 months in India, and I have been lucky to not experience anything like this. 
 It’s 9am and I’m biking through the rice fields in Hoi An. A scooter drives past me and stops ahead about 10 meters. The guy gets off and heads to the side of the road. I know what this is cause I have ridden by men peeing a couple times now. 
 But this time was different. He was turned towards me at 45° angle and holding his erect junk in his hands. His face was turned towards me. I gasped and looked away and then covered my face and eyes as I rode past him. Luckily I don’t think he followed me. 
 Wtf!???? Is this common???

 Edit: I had been looking at Kim Bespoke, Pham Custom Tailor and Nhut Tailor. 
 If you have any advice or info on these that would be great as well!

                              <span>Asking here because I suppose some foreigners in this chat would know some good rental places. I&#x27;m a local from Saigon, looking to rent a quality bike for some road trip riding. Preferably something like the Exciter or Winner because I&#x27;ll be riding into the mountains in Central highlands.
 Rental duration probably 3 weeks or so. But mainly, I&#x27;m hoping to find somewhere that can offer a bit of flexibility, because you never know what happens on a road trip. A plus point would be towing/recovery insurance just in case.

                              <span>Hello!
 This summer my friend and I are traveling to Hanoi for three days. I have been doing a lot of research and scouring this subreddit looking for help with things to do. I know three days is not a lot of time but I am torn about whether a trip to Ha Long Bay is worth it. It looks absolutely stunning but I know it is a hike to get there from Old Quarter of Hanoi. Was wondering for people who have been to Hanoi -- is two days sufficient to see the main sights? or given our limited time the day trip to Ha Long isn&#x27;t worth it? Would appreciate any insight from people who have been. Thank you and looking forward to my trip!

However I am unable to find it. I looked in the supermarkets near me and also in the Saigon Centre. My hotel is in Distrikt 1, near the Independance Palace.
 Any help is appreciated :)

                              <span>Hello I’m not really sure if this is right place to post and please let me know of there is somewhere better to post about this 
 Long story short I am Australian and my dad (54M) started dating a Vietnamese woman (37F) right before Covid. How they met I believe was through an ex of his who was also Vietnamese. My dad went overseas a few times in 2019/2020 to visit her before Covid hit and the obviously couldn’t travel again. Then in late 2022 he moved the woman and her kid here into the family home despite myself and brother having never met them 
 I am aware he was sending her money while she was overseas and since they have arrived in Australia money is a big source of argument. I believe he is still sending money to her family and that his wife still has a Vietnamese bank account and has asked for his password to his bank account. She has brought up multiple times to me that she had looked to live elsewhere in Australia or go back to Vietnam once the date is up that they meet their visa requirements 
 This all seems very concerning to me but I’m interested to hear from the Vietnamese community if this is normal or if she is just using my dad for a visa and is going to leave?
 *Forgot to add they legally got married in Australia in February 2023. Did the fake wedding in Vietnam in 2022 which was to appease family apparently. My brother and I weren’t invited or asked to attend but then randomly two days before got asked write a speech for this woman we had never never met…

                              <span>With it being so hot currently in VN. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough electricity on the grid to run the AC properly cause everyone is running an AC. 
 I want to get a electricity regulator but wife keeps saying not to. Main reason is she says electricity will be much more expensive. I ask her how much more but she isn&#x27;t able to say.
 Does anyone know? So the reasoning is that let&#x27;s say you use 1 million a month usually, with the regulator, it will make the electricity proper voltage so using more electricity even though your using the same.
 How much of an increase do you think that will be?

                              <span>I struggle to understand Vinalogic and it makes me upset. Terrible driving, disregard for other people, loud and shouting, obnoxiousness, eating with open mouths, i can keep going. 
 At the start I looked over these things but it&#x27;s starting to bother me more and more. i don&#x27;t expect people to be like me and I don&#x27;t expect Vietnam to behave like my home country. I&#x27;m not trying to change the Vietnamese people but trying to change the way I see things.
 This isn&#x27;t a shit post or post to vent but more so a question of if it gets better or not.
 Im sure the bright eye bushy tail newbies will have something to say but I&#x27;m looking for advice from expats that have been here for 5 years or longer.

                              <span>So I need to get my clothes back from a laundry service, but the guy at the reception is taking a nap. I can see him sleeping behind the counter. Should I wake him up, or should I wait?
 I know it&#x27;s a common thing to take a nap around 12, and I don&#x27;t want to be rude. But I also need underwear 🥲 What&#x27;s the etiquette in this situation?
 Edit: So I waited untill 01:30 before waking him up. The guy was a heavy sleeper, I had to make so much noise. He got up, apologized and gave me my laundry back - it was right under the counter, I could have just grabbed it 😭

 I&#x27;m an Australian Vietnamese from Sydney. I might be relocating to Saigon shortly. Curious to whether there is a running or trail running communities in Saigon?
 Also where do you do long runs?

                              <span>The lovely ladies of HCM selling them in their cases gave it to me for free when I wanted to buy only 1( Trying to curb my habit). I literally chased after them to take my money but they insisted vehemently. This happened twice at different corners. I was so embarrassed that I bought a pack later in the week.

 Edit: referring to the American War. In my ignorance, I didn’t realize my American bias in calling it the Vietnam Conflict.

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 I&#x27;m travelling to Vietnam later this year and wanted to take my medication with me. The issue is that it requires a prescription which I dont have since I got it over the counter from a different country (but it is prescription only in my current country and cant be bought in Vietnam). 
 The medication is not an addictive/abusive or psychedelic substance (so no opioids and not a adhd/anxienty/depression medication or whatever), and Im only planning to take what I need with me, so no massive quantities either.
 Would I end up having any troubles taking it to Vietnam? Im not so worried if it gets confiscated, just dont want to end up in prison or anything. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hello, is it a common thing for vietnamese people to say the opposite of what they mean? 
 Like for example when they see a cute baby, I heard from a family member saying why are you so ugly? Their intent is to say the baby is cute but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a cultural thing or do I just have family members that can&#x27;t say how they truly feel.
 Cam on!

                              <span>Since I have a remote job, I&#x27;m going to visit Vietnam to work and play (and visit family). I have to bring my work computer of course. But I hear the border agents may start asking you questions if you bring a lot of electronics. I was planning to bring my work computer, personal computer, Nintendo Switch and possibly my DSLR. What do you think of this? Some friends are telling me to leave the DLSR and personal computer at home and some suggest my iPad instead of my personal computer so I&#x27;m not traveling with two computers. Any advice on this? I just prefer my personal computer for ease of use, multiple tabs, search history and research. I know I can do it all on my phone and iPad too. Also, how dangerous is it to bring your DSLR when visiting tourists areas? I know many photographers do it but I don&#x27;t want to lose anything on the trip or be a target for theft of course.
 ​
 Just any advice or personal opinions/experiences would be great.

                              <span>The indochinese tiger formerly common around Southeast asia have gone extinct in vietnam dued to be relentlessly hunted within vietnam.We would need to import tigers from surrounding countries that have tigers that are genetically similar to the former tigers of Vietnam. Money and people would be needed to do this.Restoring nature in vietnam would be a noble pursue and a good way to spend time without wasting your time.

                              <span>Got hit with my girlfriend on the back while we were pulling into our apartment. No oncoming traffic, I was signaling to turn left and a car hit the gas and tried passing us into where I was turning. 
 Luckily no major injuries, although I had to spend the whole morning getting checked and got some decent cuts on my feet (I guess sandals aren&#x27;t the way to go).
 It was a hit an run and the police already found footage of the car that hit me. But it&#x27;s all so avoidable if people just slow down. Also people on bikes need to learn how to use their signals because the car today just completely ignored mine. 
 Anyway, stay safe on the roads. I was as safe as I could&#x27;ve been and it still didn&#x27;t matter. I guess that&#x27;s the gamble you take every single day! 🎉

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I suffer from occasional panic attacks and sporadic moments of severe anxiety and I&#x27;m prescribed Alprazolam for this. 
 I have been travelling for a few months and my small supply has run out so I&#x27;m looking to buy a new box. 
 Has anyone got a good address where they don&#x27;t sell the fake stuff? Could be another brand as long as it is legit and not some weird concoction. 
 Before I left my doctor gave me a paper explaining that I need to take this medicine, but I don&#x27;t have a prescription for more at this present time. Does the paper (signed by the doctor) indicating that I am allowed to take this medicine as needed suffice to get it? 
 Also any idea on prices? 
 Thank you all for taking the time to answer!

                              <span>I think it’s just so common as a Viet living abroad that random people shouting out Nihao or ching-chong all just straight up asking : Are you Chinese? Are you Korean? You look Chinese … etc. While in Vietnam, if we see a white person and we want to know where they’re from, we respectfully ask: Where are you from? We did not just straight up calling them French, Canadian or some nationality. We just referred to them as ”Tây” &#x3D; Westerner; or “Người nước ngoài” &#x3D; People from outer countries. If you’re back people will say you black. If you’re white people say you’re white. But when your EA or SEA or random Asian they say ‘Chinese’??? 
 Asia is so diverse, there are Laos, Mongolia, Malaysia, etc. :) Especially Vietnam has a painful history fighting back from China and suffers from cultures destruction and assimilation by Chinese, the feeling is worse. 
 I wish one day everyone can be more acknowledged of racial diversity in Asia and ask them more general question like : “Which part of Asian are you from? What’s your ethnicity?” Instead of labeling people with something that we are not sure of.

Cho đến bây giờ thì bạn ấy đã ct nyc nên tôi mới dám nói và bạn ấy cũng thừa nhận là đã có lúc bạn ấy cũng từng thích tôi, và bây giờ thì bạn ấy mới ct nyc nên cảm xúc rất rối loạn và k biết cảm xúc của bạn ấy với tôi là thật hay nhất thời, đến vài ngày sau thì tôi với bạn ấy vẫn ib như thường ngày nhưng tôi lỡ miệng nói ra là tôi bị tim và phổi bẩm sinh và k còn nhiều thời gian nữa nên giờ tôi k biết làm như nào, khi bạn ấy biết bạn ấy rất buồn và shok vì có quá nhiều chuyện ập đến với bạn ấy. Tôi đã chọn cách rời đi nhưng tôi bây giờ rất nhớ bạn ấy, các ông các bà cho tôi 1 lời khuyên với tời gian của tôi không còn nhiều nữa rồi.

 ex: Japan I heard their ATMs actually had better rates. But using their banks there, had a HUGE fee. 
 What should I do for Vietnam? My bank seems to have a really bad conversion.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I found out today that my grandma from Vietnam has liver cancer. She’s in the last stage and she has very few years to live. My family is hiding that news from her, and I don’t feel good about it. I mean I understand their intentions of not telling my grandma that she has cancer for her mental health, etc. But it feels extra wrong because they lied to her and said that her tumor was benign. I feel like it’s fair to share the news when the time is right, so she can maybe live life a bit differently. 
 Maybe I’m just Vietnamese-American and I just don’t understand the culture. Can someone give me more perspective and understanding to this difficult situation?

                              <span>Hello Folks! This is the first time I&#x27;ll be DJaying at a Chinese/Vietnamese wedding and have no clue about good songs to play.
 I will be playing the usual global charts English music but I think it would also be good to infuse some popular Chinese or Vietnamese songs that the couple and their families might enjoy dancing to!
 Of course I tried looking at charts on Spotify etc but I think it would be more valuable to have suggestions from native people!
 Please recommend me some songs that I can play at the wedding party.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello everyone! Today I would like to discuss some tech and apps that can improve our daily routines. There are many apps and services that already make life easier in other countries. Some countries have completely automated and digitized everyday life. For example, there are apps that help with logistics such as scheduling appointments or managing deliveries; grocery delivery apps; payment apps that make transactions quicker and more secure. Doctor&#x27;s appointments, accounting services, freelance work - the list goes on. And it is not necessarily something complicated and expensive, some services are convenient and popular, although behind them is a small development team.
 So, please share the apps and services that you&#x27;re excited to try. Share your experiences and opinions, and feel free to elaborate on any particular features or benefits that you found most useful. Thank you for your input!
 Who knows, maybe it will come to life soon)

 Chuyện là người nhà mình có xài thẻ Credit của VPBank, nhưng hầu như không sử dụng để thanh toán thường nhật. Trưa ngày 10/4/2023 khi kiểm tra điện thoại, người nhà mình nhận được tin nhắn từ VPBank báo thẻ Credit của mình bị trừ tổng cộng 44.488.950 đồng, chia làm nhiều đợt giao dịch như hình đính kèm. Sau đó kiểm tra tài khoản VPBank thì đúng là có bị trừ thật. Sau khi phát hiện tài khoản bị trừ gần hết hạn mức 50 triệu thì rất hoảng loạn, vì theo cảm quan thì biết là đã bị hack tài khoản rồi, đối tượng sau khi hack thành công thì dùng số tiền này để chạy quảng cáo facebook, vì tin nhắn từ VPBank báo về trên điện thoại với nội dung như vậy. Sau khi gọi điện thẳng đến tổng đài của VPBank yêu cầu khóa thẻ khẩn cấp, thì vẫn thấy chưa yên tâm nên ngay sau đó chạy thẳng ra Ph…</span>

                              <span>I am considering a move to Ha Giang as it is one of the colder cities in Vietnam, but I am having trouble finding long-term rental listings on Facebook and other real estate websites. I was wondering if anyone else who is an expat currently lives in Ha Giang and could offer me some advice on how to find a place to live.
 I also have some concerns about moving to a smaller city, as I currently live in Hanoi. While I am drawn to the cooler climate and natural beauty of Ha Giang, I worry about the potential challenges of living in a smaller city with fewer amenities and opportunities.
 If anyone has made a similar transition from a larger city to a smaller one in Vietnam, I would love to hear about your experience and any advice you may have. How did you adjust to the change in pace and lifestyle? What were some unexpected challenges or benefits of living in a smaller city?
 Thank you in advance for your help and insights.

 In Thailand a lot of the malls conveniently have scales that give you a pretty good reading for some pocket change.
 Has anyone seen these around in Saigon and if so at which malls? Also open to other venues of regularly getting my body weight measured.

                              <span>I am planning on going a trip to Vietnam for 2 months. I may take some private lessons at VLS, but they are a little expensive. If anyone has any recommendations for other good schools, I would be interested. I want to get a headstart first, as well as continue virtual lessons after I leave. There are a lot of tutors on iTalki, but I&#x27;d like hear firsthand from students who have been very pleased with their tutor.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be going to HCMC for the first time. Im researching which part of the city to book accomodation. 
 What i dont need is: bars, partying, tourist sites, etc
 What i like is: lots of walking along mom and pop shops, eating in local food shops, popping in for a foot massage from time to time.
 Are there pedestrian friendly neighborhoods that you like or would recommend?

                              <span>Went inside to test ride a small training bike for my 5 year old. Going on the first test ride, I noticed that the tires were nearly flat deflated. Obviously my kid struggled to ride it well.
 On the return around, I asked why is the tire deflated? Can you inflate the tire so we can have a better test?
 Their smart answer was, &quot;It comes from the factory like that. If you want us to inflate it, you&#x27;ll have to buy it first.&quot;
 Completely ridiculous. Mind you we are still evaluating and testing the product, and you want us to make a buying decision while the product is unusable? After that conversation, I noticed the handle bar was completely loose. Figures as much why my son struggle to turn the bike. I put the bike back to find another bike. The 2nd bike I found also had a handle bar that was also completely loose from the front wheel. Someone assembling the product in their department needs to be evaluated.
 Why on earth do you setup a display of bikes that are unprepared for test ride for children? Why is your smart response are that the bikes &quot;come from the factory like that&quot; an appropriate answer for deflated tires? And why do you expect people to buy it from you while they can&#x27;t even get normal working conditions to evaluate the quality of a product?
 I didnt expect this type of low end service behavior from buying at a department store, at a big mall no less.

                              <span>This question is not just for vietjetair, it helps me if you have the same issue with any other form in Viet Nam. :)
 I am a foreigner in Vietnam, when I buy a flight on Vietnam Airlines I have no problems because the website is well developed, but when I buy it on vietjetair, the website does not allow more than 25 characters in the given name and last name fields. I have a very long European given and last name and it doesn&#x27;t fit on the form.
 I always have to shorten it and that causes me a lot of problems at the airport because while passing control they stop me saying the name in the ticket is no the same name shown in the passport, I always waste time explaining to the staff that my name doesn&#x27;t fit on the form when I buy the ticket through the Web. Many times I have to wait until manager comes and tell me is ok after check my passport and explain again the issue and once I almost miss flight because they made me wait too long.
 I have contacted the company and they do not give me any solution. Anyone with the same problem?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Due to the low price of high quality cigarettes and the lack of availability of cigars, I&#x27;ve found myself caught in the net of cigarette addiction. 
 I&#x27;m having an incredibly difficult time finding things like nicotine patches, nasal sprays, lozenges, etc.
 All I can find is a product called Oh No from Long Chau pharmacy. 
 These small little bottles of lozenges really aren&#x27;t doing the trick for me. They are expensive and the bottles run out very quickly. 
 Has anybody else had success with finding a decent product around here?
 Even smokeless tobacco seems impossible to find. 
 I&#x27;m feeling desperate. 
 Thanks for your time.

                              <span>Hello guys, i have been living in Vietnam for 3 years and using an old Nouvou 4. After some road trips i have a desire to buy a better one. I am battling between NVX 155 and Airblade 150.
 I am about 173cm, 65kg, drive often and enjoy road trips with my gf. So could anyone that have been using any of those 2 bikes gimme an advice? Thank you so much 🙌

                              <span>Hi everyone! I am visiting beautiful Da Nang, and staying on the coast south of the city. Across the street there seems to be a lot of buildings that lack windows on the sides and only have front ones.
 Does anyone know why this is?

 Does anyone have experience with people from abroad doing business in Vietnam? To be more exact, let’s say wood pellet manufacturing and exporting abroad?

                              <span>Hi, anyone here knows how to get from Võ Văn Tần, Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam to Dai Nam Go kart Theme Park? 
 I plan to rent a motorcycle, but I&#x27;m scared of being stopped by officers on the road. I have license, but I&#x27;m from a different country.
 ​
 Question is:
 - How to get there if I&#x27;m not going to use a rented motorcycle?
 - Is it safe to just go there using a rented motorcycle?
 - Should I book from taxi mobile application? 
 - Is commute an easy way?
 ​
 Thank you so much, Peeps!

                              <span>I am planning to arrive in HCMC tomorrow for 2 weeks with additional week in Da Nang. Seek your quick advice:
  
SIM Card?: I have been suggested its better to not buy at the airport. Plan is to get a Grab to my hotel, check in, and then find some shop for SIM Card. However, can you recommend which SIM Card/company is better? (Just want reliable internet/data)
 
Where to exchange currency?: While airport is a no go (will exchange just enough for taxi and check in), curious if there&#x27;re any specific places with great exchange rates? (Eg. SuperRich in Bangkok is known for its highly competitive exchange rate). 
 
 Or Is it feasible to withdraw money from the ATM? (Again, eg. in Bangkok, you are charged 220 THB right away for every ATM withdrawal so unless you&#x27;re withdrawing chunk of cash, its just dropping money on avoidable)
  
Worth it to drive moped/bike to get around? For reference, I have driven in South Asia so I am quite used to...uh, interesting drivers.

I’d like to buy a good amount, but not break the bank. Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>So! My factory has cats, and ants flock to our auto feeder that plugs in to feed them.
 Anyone know where in hcmc i can maybe buy something to stop it?
 Ive read about motes, not sure i can use it/make one that isnt too high. My cats are small still so they may not reach or knock it over trying to get high enough.
 I figured maybe someone in VN has the same problem and found a good way to stop, or bought something?

 ​
 So some background information. I&#x27;m an American who got a B.S. Electrical Engineering degree back in 2016. After school I ended up hating electrical engineering and took a job working in media out of college, but I hated that too. Then in early 2020 I switched careers to IT and got a bunch of basic IT certifications. I have been working as IT support for the last 3 years.

                              <span>Is the consulate in San Francisco open? Every time I call them, it just rings, then goes to mailbox, which is always full, so I can&#x27;t even leave a message. If they are open, can I just walk in to request getting my documents legalized?
 Appreciate any information on this.

 What fees are there? 
 Is it flat-rate or percentage? 
 Any currency conversion fees? 
 Is the sender or the receiver charged the fees?

                              <span>I left my phone in my grab at around 1am. I’m able to track it using my work phone and have been following it for most of the night.
 I set my phone as lost on ‘Find My iPhone’ with the following message Chiếc iphone này bị bỏ lại sau khi nhặt, vui lòng gọi (dads phone number here) để trả lại càng sớm càng tốt hoặc chuyển đến Fusion Suites Sài Gòn or WhatsApp (my phone number here, as I have WhatsApp on this phone instead of my personal)
 The best part is that as soon as I did that the driver did actually call my dad but unfortunately due to language constraints between the two they weren’t able to communicate effectively. 
 What’s frustrating though is that since then I have tried to call my phone multiple times and the driver has refused to pick up. 
 I have tried reaching out to grab via their helpline but the phone line keeps getting disconnected. I am also unable to sign into my grab account on this second phone as I need Facebook 2FA and the code generator is on my personal phone. 
 Just looking for advice, support, next steps or others who have faced something similar I guess. 
 I’m worried that the phone will eventually die and I will no longer be able to track it and then all hope is lost lol.

                              <span>Hey so I really need some advice, I’m currently in the USA I am a social worker, attempting to work with a Vietnamese family.
 Already there is a language barrier they speak very little English and when I try to use a translator it seems to upset them and they try to communicate with me in small phrases but obviously I lose meaning of what they try to say and they lose meaning of what I try to say.
 So far he has gotten mad at me twice, one for walking upstairs wit my shoes on and another by attempting to contact his wife without going through him.
 At this point I think I’m just culturally missing some elements that he is starting to take as disrespect, I have to talk to them again at their house in a few days and I’m not trying to get cursed out again in Vietnamese pls help.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;ll be moving to Saigon soon (district 1) and I was wondering if you can recommend stores in the area where I could buy some home essentials like small electronic appliances, kitchen utensils, bedsheets, towels, etc.
 Also, are there any supermarkets in district 1 where I could find Western products and ingredients? I have a senstitive stomach, so I might need some type to adapt..
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi people! This is my first time ever creating a post in Reddit. After searching through the internet I couldn&#x27;t find an answer for this question.
 How do you respond in Vietnamese when you get compliments appearance wise?
 I&#x27;m half Chinese and half Vietnamese living in Europe. In China you don&#x27;t really say thank you. You just downplay it or deny it playfully.
 I grew up ugly so I never had this encounter but now as an adult I have gotten couple compliments. I just don&#x27;t know how to answer other than giggling and shaking my head. Thank you for the help. ❤️

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am visiting HCMC in early June, partially as a vacation but partially to learn more about the local scene for entrepreneurs and freelancers. I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I&#x27;m strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.
 As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I&#x27;m not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.
 Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats? Anyone here running their own small business or online business in Vietnam and would like to meet for a coffee or beer?
 Thanks for reading!

                              <span>Xin chào, 
 I am currently travelling around Vietnam with my girlfriend and we are in Ninh Binh where it is raining today tomorrow with some thunderstorms(apparently) and I am just wondering what are common indoor activities or that when it is raining so much?
 Is it similar to other countries like bowling/cinema in bigger cities or is there some more localised activities?
 If anyone has any suggestions for Ninh Binh I&#x27;d be very thankful but it just made me think about everywhere else around the country too.

 Does anyone have any recommendations? I&#x27;ll only be there for 5 days so it&#x27;ll have to a quick one as well.

                              <span>Hi! I’m a computer scientist graduate looking to relocate from the UK to Vietnam in September. 
 I have almost 2 years internship experience with multinational corporations on top of my degree. I’m mostly interested in positions involving cloud, DevOps, networking and operating systems, rather than full time software development. 
 How easy would it be for a non Vietnamese graduate to find an entry level position? What would a reasonable monthly wage be? I’ve seen positions ranging from $900-2500, and was wondering what an acceptable range for negotiation would be. Lastly, are there any specific websites I can look for jobs? I’ve currently just been using LinkedIn, Glassdoor and indeed. 
 Thank you in advance for your help 🙏

                              <span>I arrived a few days ago and bought my SIM card at the airport. It’s 4GB/day with calling. 
 Randomly during the day my service will completely stop working. It’ll last for hours before it starts again. I’ve turned off my VPN, restarted my phone, turned on/off airplane mode. Nothing works. 
 Is this common and how do I fix it?

 I want to learn Vietnamese as well as the history of the country, yet it is very difficult to find content due to me not being able to read Vietnamese. Is there any form of media anyone can recommend? Please help! Thanks.

 I recently came across a painting, which I believe is the work of a talented Vietnamese artist. However, the signature on the artwork is a bit tricky to read, and I&#x27;m struggling to identify who the artist might be. That&#x27;s where your expertise comes in! 😄
 Here&#x27;s the signature:

                              <span>Is it worth to travel by train in Vietnam? How is the comfort and are delays common or are most train in time? Would like to take a train from Central Vietnam to HCM (about 12 hours ride) and take a plane from there later. Found a coonection with 4 hours arrival in HCM before the plane leaves. Is that a possible thing to do or do I need a lot of luck?
 Option b would be to arrive early in HCM airport and stay there over night, though not sure if thats recommended.

                              <span>I was on Ta Hien street last night and was planning to just walk (ten minutes) to the hotel but the obnoxious cab drivers would not stop pestering me so I just took a taxi. I told the driver my hotel name and he started driving and then takes me to like four different hotels and each time I say this is not my hotel.
 Finally he asks to use my phone for google maps and I hate handing my phone over but was tired and starting to feel sick. I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn&#x27;t hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.
 He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn&#x27;t) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn&#x27;t even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.
 POLICE are zero help because I don&#x27;t remember the drivers cab number. Is there ANYTHING I can do? My phone is not showing on the findmyiphone app.

                              <span>So I often get these friend requests from attractive looking Vietnamese female profiles on Facebook. Sometimes they are from Vietnam and sometimes they are in the US. They would chat with me and reveal their scam by trying to get me to sell random stuffs for them on some scam sites that give them commissions. I think they themselves believe that those scam sale sites are legit. 
 Another scam is they say they trade options to make money on the side and can help me make money, I never let it go further than that so I don’t know exactly how they do it. However, 90% of them would just chat and talk to me for weeks and months. I entertain them and keep talking to them to see what the scam is but it never comes. I talk to them like a normal respectful person but never show them that I am thirsty. Eventually they just stop talking to me. 
 The one thing in common I noticed is that they would edit old photo posts from months and years ago. Why do this? Is it their way of establishing that the profile is legit because they have posts from years ago? Is there ever a legit reason for someone to edit photos from a couple years ago? I am just trying to understand what is it they want from me or what kind of scam it is because it is a lot of time and efforts they go through. Thank you guys.

                              <span>The past 3 times I have used Grab for a ride I have had issues finding the driver.
 I am always very careful when inputting the pickup address and drop a pin exactly where I am on the map. But when I go to find them I am walking up and down the street and can&#x27;t see them.
 I have a 4G sim. Am I doing something wrong or is the app location a bit off sometimes?

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping this is the right place to ask - I&#x27;m looking for a European based Vietnamese teacher to help me improve my Vietnamese. I lived in Hanoi for a couple of years where my learning was very minimal and since moving back to Europe, I would like to improve my level. 
 I take online lessons but the time zones make it a bit difficult with a teacher based in Vietnam, so it limits my lessons to an hour a week.
 If anyone here knows anyone that would be able to help me, or point me in the right direction, that&#x27;d be perfect. They don&#x27;t need to be a qualified teacher, just someone who I could practice with, and is able to explain about the grammar/pronunciations aspects.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m in Vietnam for the second time, I last visited 7 years ago. I could have sworn that pho bo was almost always served with mint on the side. I&#x27;ve been here nearly a month and haven&#x27;t seen a single mint leaf in the dish or on the plate on the side... 
 Did I create a false memory in my head or something? It&#x27;s driving me crazy!
 I&#x27;ve been in Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An and Da Lat if that helps. Is it a regional thing?

                              <span>I plan to do a lot of riding, some hiking, and lots of walking through towns and cities. Also, I&#x27;m guessing its unsafe to leave your bag on your bike as you explore, would that be correct?
 EDIT: I am asking here because of size of moto/culture of leaving stuff on the bike, etc.
 Any insights appreciated, thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving to Hanoi this summer and am looking to play some football (soccer) when I have the chance. What soil do people in Hanoi usually play on? Real grass, turf or something else? So I can get appropriate footwear before arriving.
 Thanks!

 Mình cần giúp tìm bài nhạc mà mỗi lần xe tải lùi về là sẽ nghe được. Bài nhạc nghe như “lá la la la là, là lá la la là lá là là la”.

                              <span>I LOVE Vietnamese food and have been indulging in every dish I can find. However, both me and my gf noticed we have extremely smaller appetites here as compared to home (USA).
 I suppose I&#x27;ve been doing slightly less excercisey things (i.e no lifting weights) but we still walk probably a couple miles a day. Plus, I feel like I can go into bottomless pit mode at home when I&#x27;m just being a couch potato. 
 Anyone else experience this? For the record, I eat a relatively healthy diet back in the states so I dont think it&#x27;s due to me consuming less processed foods.

                              <span>Hey, Unfortunately my camera cap for my lense (Sony 55mm)is broken and I need a new cap. Even though I went to several camera stores in Hanoi, I didn&#x27;t find such a cap. Does anyone know a store in Hanoi, which sells such caps? The lense is a Sony 3.5-5.6 / 18-135 and diameter is 55mm. Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Just wondering what all youth sports are available in VN, specifically in Đà Nẵng. I figured football is likely the most popular. Other than basketball, what other team sports is common? What about individual sports? We’re moving there soon and trying to see what will be available for my boys. They’re currently in baseball, soccer/football, and folkstyle wrestling. Doesn’t look like they’ll have access to wrestling from my limited research. What about baseball? Thanks for any info/suggestions!

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m coming to Vietnam soon and I was hoping to do a three-day long Halong bay cruise at the end of April. I&#x27;ve been browsing various websites, but it seems that most of them charge quite hefty for a single person ($600+). Is that price normal? Is there a way to find more affordable Halong bay cruise?

                              <span>As I travel from south to north in Vietnam, I’m starting to run out of time in the north. And I really enjoy the north. I’m pretty bummed that I spent time wasted in Mūi Né. The beaches had trash, most restaurants were tourist traps with insanely small portions, and there was little to no culture. I guess the only plus is that it made me realize how much I absolutely love Dalat, Hôi An, and Phong Nha.

                              <span>What&#x27;s a reasonable daily rate to pay a local translator to help conduct interviews for academic research in Da Lat and the surrounding area? Would be VNMese-English, up to 3 hour-long interviews/day. Including travel time etc, likely to be 5-10 full days of work in total.

                              <span>Hi! Me and my girlfriend are spending a week in Vietnam during the first week of august. I understand this is raining season. While looking for the best places to stay during raining season I came across Cat Ba Island. Beautiful area, less touristy then Halong Bay while still having plenty of restaurant options and other things to do. 
 However, when looking at the weather forecast for august it says there could be monsoons and very heavy rain. Is this still doable or would it be cloudy and raining for most of the day? 
 Other suggestions are also really appreciated!
 Thanks

                              <span>According to the report by Vietnam Ministry of Health, as of April 10, 2023, there has been a sudden increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country, and Hanoi is currently leading in the number of new cases. 
 There has been a significant increase in the number of Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals, and many of them require oxygen support, especially the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.
 So, should we worry about the new wave of Covid-19?

Is this a good price ? If not anywhere you recommend ?

                              <span>I always used this term in order to refer to the Vietnamese fighters from the second world War, I&#x27;m actually a big fan of Vietnam because they were brave enough to defeat world power countries in many wars protecting the territory against the invasors, however I was talking to my teacher who is a history scholar and he said that this term is racist. 
 I was confused because I always considered it a sort of Pride specially because here in south America as the history of Vietnam has always been a inspiration for us. 
 I&#x27;m also quite embarrassed, I have a friend from Vietnam and I&#x27;ve been using this term for a while, well this friend never said anything against it, this is what makes me even more confused.

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering Lasik eye surgery in Saigon. The last post here re Lasik was a few years ago and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has had the procedure done more recently than that? Cao Thang Eye Hospital looks good.
 Hoping to get recommendations for hospital and costs as well as actual recovery time and follow up appointments.
 As a solo traveller is the recovery something that you can get through on your own? Is it as simple as having a hotel to stay at for the following night and arranging a lift from the hospital back to the hotel?
 What about follow up appointments, I&#x27;m not overly keen on staying in HCMC for too long. How about heading to Danang the following day and checking back in at HCMC on the way back to flying out? Were you able to swim and ride a motorbike after the procedure? I think swimming is not recommended. Just wondering what to do in recovery I guess.

                              <span>I’ve seen so many celebrities and people with cars in Vietnam posting videos of themselves and their kids with no car seat at all in the car. Isn’t that very dangerous for kids? Why isn’t anyone considered of car seats? Is there no laws about it? Just curious.

I wanted to buy some t shirts, the shop keepers were extremely rude and gestured me to get out. 😥Honestly confused as all other markets have been wonderful. Why were they so aggressive when there was still time for the market to close.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have a question about buying a DJI mini 3 pro with the RC and Fly more kit plus in Vietnam. I&#x27;ll be visiting the country in about a month and I&#x27;m wondering how much it would cost to buy this product in a local store. Unfortunately, I cannot order it from the official DJI site because I&#x27;ll be moving around a lot.
 Can anyone recommend the best stores to go to for purchasing this drone in Vietnam? Also, I&#x27;m a bit concerned about the legality of flying drones in Vietnam. What happens if the police catch you with a drone? Is it illegal to fly drones in certain areas of the country?
 Thank you for your help and advice in advance. I&#x27;m really looking forward to my trip to Vietnam and I&#x27;d love to capture some amazing footage with my new drone.

                              <span>We arrived in Halong bay yesterday and we are so confused as to why there are literally no tourists and not even that many locals. It’s a place that we can see has many large buildings at the facilities for so many tourists but there’s no one here it’s like a ghost town? My research told me it was going to be absolutely packed full and we have just driven around and seen hardly anyone. Any explanations?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My fiancée and I are planning to take a trip out to Nha Ttrang in September/October. My company does not give me much vacation time - only 3 weeks a year - so for this trip, I am only looking to spend about 7-ish days in VietNam, with a few of them specifically in Nha Trang.
 I make a fairly good income at my job - just shy over $100K USD - and I&#x27;m not reluctant to spend $130-$180 a night at a nice hotel with my fiancée. Unfortunately we are in the process of waiting for a Visa, so do not see one another that frequently. My fiancée doesn&#x27;t care too much about fancy accommodations since she grew up fairly frugal, but I don&#x27;t mind spending the extra $$ because I&#x27;m a little spoiled.
 Anyways, what is everyone&#x27;s favourite luxury hotel in Nha Trang? We we will be taking a flight from HCM. The 40-50min drive from the airport isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, so the hotel does not necessarily need to be in a convenient in-between location from airport and the night market.
 We&#x27;ve looked up a few spots already; Queen Ann, Ariyana SmartCondotel, and Panorama by HLG.
 The biggest thing I&#x27;m looking for is a comfortably-sized shower for additional intimacy.

 Alternatively have you seen any bone broth products in stores that are local and not imported. I would assume I can find some imported products at Anan (I’m in HCM) but would rather opt for a local product.

 I hope to do a work away during my time there to fully experience the culture there. In short, it is a platform that allows people to arrange homestays and cultural exchange. And volunteers can contribute a pre-agreed amount of time per day in exchange for lodging and food, which is provided by their host. 
 Places of interest: Dalat, Sapa or Ha Giang. (Open to other places as well).
 Areas of interest or things I can contribute: Specialty coffee or any cafe, Coffee farms, Coaching competitive swimming or Learn to swim, Crossfit Gym or Commercial gym, Teaching English/Mandarin/Maths/ Sciences.
 Feel free to PM to understand more. Thanks!

                              <span>My Vietnamese friends told me that Vietnam has a high HIV rate. Drug users use needles and infect each other with HIV. Then they have sex with hookers which spreads more HIV. Customers that see hookers spread HIV to their wives etc. Is this true? 
 HIV rate in Vietnam seems very high compare to South Korea or Japan. Let me know what you think as a local Vietnamese. 
 (Vietnam also has a high cancer rate but I&#x27;ll make another thread on that)

                              <span>Just wanted to hear thoughts of those outside of western worlds.
 Australia getting pretty grim with high interest rates and corporate owned houses for renting, rich boomer generation buying multiple houses to rent out and rich overseas investors buying 5+ houses to rent out. A lot more homeless around nowadays. 
 But our salaries are alright, even a waiter can afford a house if we save good for 3-5 years, we could probably get a mortgage that will take a life time to pay off.
 I went over to vietnam and found out that salaries can be 250k to 500k VND, depending on location. But the property prices are equivalent to USA and Aus. 
 Not everyone will have corporate jobs or be in a financial situation to afford these prices.
 How is it looking for those who are starting from scratch? No family to assist, just a normal everyday job.

                              <span>I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China&#x27;s actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can&#x27;t expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn&#x27;t know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

                              <span>Hi there!
 After searching the subreddit, I&#x27;ve seen several questions about short layovers in HCMC (5-6 hours max). Most of the consensus I&#x27;ve read is that Tan Son Nhat makes that short of a stopover risky, and best to stay in the airport. However, in June I&#x27;ll be flying in on my way back to Australia and I&#x27;ll have 10 hours of stopover time from landing to the next departure.
 I already went ahead and got a visa, so that should speed things up. If I factor in 30 min to 1 hour for customs, another 30 minutes or so into the city centre via taxi, and then 30 min to get back to the airport 3 whole hours before my international departure, that still leaves me with potentially 5 hours in HCMC. Worth it in my book! I never thought I&#x27;d get to set foot in Vietnam so I&#x27;m excited to take the opportunity.
 Where&#x27;s the best area to wander for 5-ish hours in HCMC? Try some local Vietnamese dishes, get a bit of a sense of what the city is like, any quick interesting sights, etc. I&#x27;ll be there on a Friday if that makes a difference for any markets or things that will be open.
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>This was the 3rd Mongol invasion of Vietnam, along the Bạch Đằng river. The Viets positioned themselves in small flotilla along the river, and made a false retreat drawing the Mongol fleet into the trap.With the Yuan fleet trapped, the Vietnamese junks armed with bombs, attacked them from all sides. Many of the Mongols jumped into the river to save themselves were killed or drowned. The Viet captured around 400 Yuan warships.
 This victory effectively put an end to the Mongol invasions of Vietnam, though the Viet monarch Trần Nhân Tông, decided to accept the supremacy of Kublai Khan to avoid further conflicts.The failure of the Mongol invasions was however a shattering blow for their supremacy in Asia, and Vietnam&#x27;s success gave more confidence to the other Asian nations to halt the once invincible Mongol juggernaut.

                              <span>So, a couple of days ago, there was an article in vn express about how slow the immigration and baggage claim process is at the 2 big airports. I experienced that when I landed in Hanoi in late October 2022. The arrival hall was totally packed. About an hour until I got through.
 I’m wondering if anyone has experience arriving in Da Nang instead. I looked around online and there isn’t much in the way of comments about it.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Base on a article on “Tuoitre” According to the explanation of the Chairman of Hoi An City Nguyen Van Son, the revenue from entrance tickets serves the conservation, embellishment and restoration of monuments, renovating the infrastructure in the old quarter, and organizing events. tourism events, as well as supporting people in home renovation and renovation, etc. At the same time, it is compulsory to buy tickets for all visitors when visiting Hoi An ancient town to ensure fairness for the locality and visitors. 
 Ticket prices are issued at 120,000 VND/ticket for international visitors and 80,000 VND/ticket for domestic visitors. Such a two-price policy that distinguishes between domestic and foreign people, dating back several decades, is completely out of line with international practices. 
 There are two types of spaces that need to be clearly defined, where the proposed toll is public space or owned space (eg museums, monuments...). If the space is owned, the owner has the right to collect a fee. On the contrary, if it is a public space, it belongs to the whole people, belongs to everyone, and has no right to collect fees. 
 Hoi An sells entrance tickets, in the case of legality, on the one hand, it brings the city&#x27;s budget but on the other hand increases the cost of tourists.
 I strongly think this is a step back for Hoi An tourism some Comment I ever read even said don’t turn “Hội An” to “Hội Ăn”

                              <span>Im flying to Da Nang from Hanoi this week, and I’m traveling all of Southeast Asia, so I brought my drone (DJI mavic mini) to film in places where it is allowed. I read some horror stories online about drone confiscation at Da Nang airport, and I’m really afraid for my drone now. I always keep the batteries separate (they are my powerbank when traveling) and I’m flying domestic, I have never heard any issues with domestic flights but I just wanted to be sure.

                              <span>Hello! I am a child of Vietnamese immigrants. I can speak and understand a bit of Vietnamese. I wish I could understand more of it, to surpass my family&#x27;s language barrier.
 Please recommend me some Vietnamese songs!! I must say that I am not a fan of the Vietnamese music genre(???). You know! Long, drawn-out words with vibrato, sung along with some sort of stringed instrument (sorry mom!!!). 
 I want songs with Vietnamese lyrics, but in another style. Rock &amp; Pop-Rock are my preferred genres. Fast, upbeat! And I don&#x27;t care what the lyrics say as long as they are in Vietnamese. 
 Artists/Projects I like: Kagerou Project, Weezer, Wallows, Sex Bob-Omb 
 Please do recommend me something!!! Thank you :D

                              <span>I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China&#x27;s actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can&#x27;t expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn&#x27;t know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

 I feel weak.
 I realize my nutrition levels are low. 
 I do not speak Vietnamese. 
 Since I am eating Vietnamese food only
 So I need to seek a registered dietician in Vietnam to discuss a nutrition plan and diet. 
 If I seek a registered dietician in the west, they might not be familir with the food here. 
 Are there good English-speaking registered dieticians in Vietnam that can help me with a nutrition plan and diet? 
 Thanks!

 I do not have time to cook my food.
 I just go to cheap shops or street food.
 In the street, I see them offering food like rice, fish, chicken, etc.
 When I walk in the street, I just eat the food. 
 In the English speaking Countries, it is not recommend to eat outside due to how processed and expensive the food it is.
 Here in Vietnam, the food is so cheap. However, is the food healthy? Do they use cheap oil to cook? Do they use a lot of oil?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello People,
 I recently moved to Hanoi, Vietnam, to start a new chapter here. I love this place so much but I find myself often confused on how many options I have for grocery shopping, and it got me thinking about where could I find the best prices of groceries in spite of being a foreigner. I have got some names of some supermarkets but I was wondering If I could go even cheaper to buy groceries. If anyone here has any idea I would really appreciate it and hopefully others coming to Vietnam can benefit from this post if someone drops any value here.
 Thank you and have a nice day

                              <span>I was in a bar in HCMC about 6 months ago and caught the last few songs of this bands performance and it was wonderful. 
 Can anyone identify the song? 
 Thanks everyone :))

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to Vietnam on holiday for a few weeks and would really like to bring something back for the Vietnamese people who work in my nail salon and their families. I don&#x27;t know any of them on a friend basis but really love them and they rarely get to go back. If I ask them what they&#x27;d like me to bring back, they&#x27;d say nothing, so just wondered if there&#x27;s some kind of very popular and loved chocolate / snack etc that I could bring back for them?

                              <span>In the time I’ve been here in Vietnam, I’ve come across Falun Gong/Falun Dafa a surprisingly high number of times, including meeting one man who practiced this who spoke English and was able to actually tell me something about this group. 
 Being from the UK, I can’t say I’ve had much actual experience with what Falun Gong is beyond the whole China situation, which as you can imagine often attracts a lot of negativity and general bad feeling. 
 I’m wondering how Falun Gong is actually viewed by Vietnamese people. I’m guessing given the amount of times I’ve come across practitioners, it’s viewed more favourably than it is in the UK or other places.

                              <span>I will be flying to Bangkok tomorrow and just realized that I still have more than 1 million VND left. Since ATM fees in BKK are quite high anyway, I thought about exchanging my VND stock. Which would be the way of minimized loss? Exchange VND in BKK or at Hanoi airport? Or maybe change to USD in Hanoi and then to Baht in Bangkok? Happy about helping input!

                              <span>I am currently in Vietnam and need help getting a book. The book is &quot;This One Wild and Precious Life: The Path Back to Connection in a Fractured World by Sarah Wilson&quot;.
 I can&#x27;t find it on any Vietnamese websites, so my question is, what are the best international websites to buy and ship to Vietnam. 
 My current plan is to order it to my home in the UK, and have someone ship it to me here, surely there is a better option. 
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been going out on dates here in HCMC with a girl who, though she has lived in HCMC since university, is originally from the city of Tay Ninh. Her family apparently follows Cao Dai. She herself says she has no religion, though she is quite interested in Buddhist philosophy and often reads Buddhist-flavored self-help books (like Thich Nhat Hanh and Haemin Sunim).
 Anyway, she&#x27;s incredibly kind, fun-loving, philosophical, selfless, and more. I&#x27;m just wondering whether coming from a family that follows Cao Dai is like the Vietnamese equivalent of a Mormon family, a Scientology family, or really just no big deal? Is there anything I should be aware of?

                              <span>Hi! I’m planning a trip this October to Vietnam with my boyfriend for our birthdays for about 2.5 weeks. His birthday is the 18th and mine the 24th! For additional context, He is a city guy and I’m more of a nature and landscape gal. We both like water. So based on that I was curious which itinerary anyone would anyone recommend in mid October taking into account the central region rainy season. We also want to ensure we have the most sun/best warm weather in the islands.
 I’m not sure on the amount of days yet in each place so any recommendations are welcome :) also are there any “must see” places I am missing that would fit into the below with the amount of time we have? Thank you!! 
 Itinerary 1 Land in Hanoi-&gt; Sapa-&gt; Halong Bay -&gt; hoian? (Not sure if I should avoid due to rain) Fly to Ho Chi Minh -&gt; Phu Quoc islands then back to Ho Chi Minh to fly home 
 Itinerary 2 Land in Hochiminh -&gt; Phu Quoc islands -&gt; back to Ho Chi Minh-&gt; fly to Hanoi -&gt; Sapa -&gt; Halong bay -Hanoi and any day trips from there then fly home from Hanoi

                              <span>Dear Reddit friends, first of all a big thanks for your helpful answers on my earlier questions about life in Hanoi/Vietnam!
 Next question, I understand that tab water in Hanoi is not clean enough to drink and that there was even an scandal in 2019. Since I drink a lot of water, try to avoid plastic bottles and will stay around four years, I&#x27;m considering buying a more heavy duty purifier, such as the Bluewater Spirit. https://www.bluewatergroup.com/product/bluewater-spirit/
 Does anyone have experience using such products in Hanoi/Vietnam? Or are there better local options? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello guys, I hope you&#x27;re doing well, I have a small inquiry concerning labor law and contract in Vietnam, my question is if the employer ( the school) wants to terminate the contract, don&#x27;t they have to compensate anything to the teacher? And after the termination, does the teacher have to do a visa run to start a new job with a different school or doesn&#x27;t have to exit and reenter Vietnam? Thank you in advance

 It was successful then so I&#x27;ll try it again. I&#x27;m in the technical world with some experience in building marketplaces and I&#x27;m back in Vietnam to do it all over again. I would love to meet up with any fellow Entrepreneurs, techies or any overall cool people. I&#x27;ll be in District 1 from April 11-20 - so let&#x27;s grabs beers! -Allan

                              <span>Hello fellow travellers and locals. I am currently spending my last days in Vietnam after a 3,5 week long journey from north to south and never tried Hot Pot before. Do you have any recommendations for a good Hot Pot in Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon? Preferable in District 1 but I could also take a Grab so tell me everything :) Thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>The two eastern divisions (north-east: Sylhet, south-east: Chittagong) of Bangladesh (preferably, I&#x27;d want the whole of Bangladesh to join, but idk...) to join Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to form one single united country (you may look at the map of Asia for some context if you want). I&#x27;d preferably want there to be two capitals, the western capital and the eastern capital, The western capital could be either Sylhet or Chittagong (Chattogram) and the eastern capital could be either Bangkok or Hanoi. I personally think that it would be great. I mean, look at India, it has different cultures and languages/language-families (Indo-European, Dravidian etc.).. I want these countries that I mentioned to be one country for the greater good (of humanity). Even if they were to merge, they would not be as big in size as China, India or the USA but they would be bigger in size than as they are presently.These countries that I mentioned are all connected by land, not just the water (for some more context, for those reading and looking to get it). If anyone else on here who sees this also wants this to happen, please feel free to give some suggestions and let&#x27;s gather some ideas on seeing if this could actually go forth.
 P.S.: I haven&#x27;t thought of a name for the proposed country yet.

                              <span>I am visiting Vietnam for a school internship in a few weeks and my teachers asked to bring gifts for a student we are paired with. They said that they themselves really didn’t know what to bring as gifts, and to avoid maple syrup products, since they really wouldn’t know what to do with it (I’m Canadian for context), but it was my only real idea lol. Do you have any ideas as to what to bring to my Vietnamese friend that he will definitely love? They recommended maybe a photo album of us and our families, is it a good idea? Also somethings I should avoid?

                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;m debating traveling for a few days to Hanoi at the end of June. Is the weather too miserable and rainy to visit at this time? I live in a nearby Asian country and thought I&#x27;d visit since I&#x27;ve always been wanting to go.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So i wanna visit Vietnam in 2024 in January for 2 months. So as for now my only option is to apply for 2 one-month options, and then exit the country and re-enter it. But the issue is that i also need a visa to be able to enter any country nearby, Laos,Cambodia,Thailand,etc :( Are there any other options that i am blind about?

                              <span>First of all I want to say after spending 2 of my 3 weeks in Vietnam so far it&#x27;s been great. I have spent time all over the country and have been to Ho Chi Minh, Da Lat, Nha Trang, Da Nang and Hoi An. Every city have had its unique feeling and I have loved it so far.
 Now I&#x27;m finally in Ha Long, this was supposed to be the real tropical paradise stop with beaches and swimming. Boating through the unique Islands in the bay and just relax before going to Hanoi for the flight back home. 
 I decided to go on a bot trip while in Ha Long and just enjoy the almost mystical atmosphere you get boating through the bay between hundreds of small rocky islands.But this absolutely broke my heart, instead of a mystical and paradise like environment we got nothing but waters absolutely full of trash. 
 It didn&#x27;t matter where you looked, it was just full of mostly styrofoam blocks and other plastic waste, but also some random wood and other garbage also floating around. And I&#x27;m not surprised that the waters are so littered, there where hundreds of tourist boats in the bay at any given time. Unfortunately this seem to partly be because of over tourism in the bay, and going through Ha Long city there seem to be alot of relatively new developments but 70% of it looked to be empty or abandoned. 
 I am just a tourist that get to see this city for a limited time, can anyone from the area tell me more about how you perceive the city&#x27;s and they bays development over the past few years. And if you have toured Ha Long just as me and have similar or very contrasting experiences, please share. 
 Love from Sweden 🇸🇪

                              <span>I did some googling but could not find much information on the characteristics of the Da Nang accent. I was wondering what the differences were between the Southern and Da Nang accents (what little I found says the Da Nang accent is more similar to the Southern accent than to the Northern). Can anyone give me the particulars? Thanks so much.

                              <span>Personally I dont quite fancy too popular places like those lots of foreigners would go. I will take a look for scenic spots absolutely, but would love to spend more time in local areas :D I&#x27;ve watched some Vietnamese food shows as well, OMG they are all just mouth-watering! Cant wait to try them all!
 Soooo any advice? Anything I should be cautious of? Any travel video channel recommended? How about the food? Anyway, feel free to share your experiences in Vietnam, whatever you think it&#x27;s worth being shared. Pleeeease drop your comment here. Many thanks! ✨

Maybe people here can recommend any accurate and good documentaries? I will for sure still make my own research and not watch the first recommended one! Hope this sensitive topic doesn’t offend or hurt anyone here!

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be spending nearly 3 weeks in Vietnam starting later this month and want to buy an eSIM before I go. It sounds like Viettel has by far the best service, especially to more remote areas where I&#x27;ll be going. I&#x27;d like to buy a tourist eSIM directly from Viettel and found their site https://tourist.viettel.vn/ . Looks like I have to provide a lot of personal information (including passport photo) before they provide details. Anyone have experience with buying directly from this site? I wanted to check before I provide my personal info. Thanks!

                              <span>I want to know what i should do in Vietnam to be respectful, besides the obvious things for sure. I heard that i should receive and give stuff with both hands. Or that i should have a little bow when greeting someone. Anything else like this that might be uncommon for me, an european, but is customs in Vietnam? I am asking because i want to respect the people i will meet when visit this country, and want to make sure i also follow their customs as a gratitude for welcoming me in their country! Thank you!

                              <span>Hello, I am not Vietnamese, and never live in Vietnam. I am invited to my Vietnamese friend&#x27;s wedding in HCMC. 
 What do men usually wear to Vietnamese weddings? And which colors are suitable, and which are not? And what kind of gifts do people bring to Vietnamese wedding?

                              <span>Has anyone been through the process of getting married in Vietnam as a foreigner (to a Vietnamese national)? I’ve been to my embassy for the affidavit confirming single status, had it notarised &amp; translated. The tricky one seems to be the paper confirming ‘mental fitness’ to enter a marriage. The international hospitals don’t seem to offer it. Even my Fiancée is struggling to get to the bottom of it so I turn to Reddit 😅

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 does anyone know, if it is possible to expand the permission to stay in vietnam? We got our visa to late and now we are in vietnam with the 15-day permit, that we can get with a german passport. Now we have got our 30 day visa, but the stamp in the passport says, that we have to leave Vietnam at the 12th April. We want to leave it at the 24th. Then we stayed here 28 days in total. Is it now possible, to expand the permission to stay with our visum without traviling outside of vietnam? Maybe at the immigration office in Hanoi? Has everyone tried that?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am *thinking* about taking an extended backpacing trip through Vietnam. I have never backpacked before so tbh I’m not even sure what that means. I am looking for any and all advice as I formulate my plan of travel. 
 Budgeting; if I am trying to keep it mid to low cost how much can I expect to pay per day? I found some posts that said 50$ a day would be sufficient if I stay in hostels, hitchhike, and take the bus places. (That was including lodging). Does this hold true?
 Things to do: as I have no idea what Vietnam is like i plan to soak up as much as possible. I’m told any and all caves are worth a visit. Is there anyone out there who has been to Vietnam before and is willing to share or send me their itinerary? I can taylor it to my needs but i would be forever greatful to you kind stranger. 
 If I want to travel to a different country after Vietnam has anyone had experience applying for a multi trip visa? (Google can probably answer that one for me but there’s nothing better than first hand knowledge).
 Any and all wisdom is greatly appreciated. I plan to Only bring a 40-50L backpack too. Is this feesable.? Experienced backpackers, any pointers on what I should pack and how many of each item? I tend to over pack so I would probably do 2 weeks worth of clothes if I can fit it in the backpack but if someone is able to get away with less then i‘d happily pack lighter.

                              <span>When on the road today around 8:30 AM the road was congested as always during this high traffic hour. A car tried to get by us by using the motorcycle lane. He honked and honked. While trying to pass us, the other car hit our side mirror. I could look into the other car and saw a young man in a military uniform looking very angry at us, like we were the inconvenience to him. After he passed by, I could see a red colored license plate. If I am not mistaken, that plate belongs to the military and is ranked the highest among other plates. After complaining to other people that an officer does not adhere to the law, they told me that those people ARE the law. Even normal police officers couldn’t do anything about it.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I want to learn a Vietnamese love song I can sing for my wife as a surprise anniversary present. 
 Some details about us: I am a foreigner and she is Vietnamese. We have been together for 7 years. We went broke together and came out of it doing well now. We have been through sickness (somewhat) and are in health. We use to fight about trivial matters and misunderstandings due to the language barrier but we learned to communicate better and rarely ever fight nowadays. We also have a daughter together and we are about to achieve our dream of owning our own house very soon. 
 Can you recommend me any Vietnamese love songs with lyrics or meaning similar to Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Thank you for loving me&quot;? 
 Really appreciate it!

                              <span>(English below) Mình đang là du học sinh tại Mỹ, hộ chiếu VN sắp hết hạn và phải nộp xin gia hạn qua mail. Mình lên web đại sứ quán VN thì họ bảo phải nộp phí nhưng không nói rõ là bao nhiêu, gọi điện hỏi thì không ai nghe máy, email không ai trả lời, gọi hotline thì bị chửi, trên mạng thì mỗi chỗ báo 1 giá. Xin ai có kinh nghiệm xin gia hạn trong thời gian gần đây chỉ bảo với ạ 🥲 mình cảm ơn!
 I&#x27;m a student from VN currently living in the U.S. and my VN passport is nearing expiration so I have to renew it via mail. I looked at the embassy website and they said to submit a processing fee but didn&#x27;t specify how much. I tried to reach them by their regular phone number and email (no one answered/voicemail was full), and when I finally got through the hotline the guy who picked up just got mad at me lol. If you have experience applying for passport renewal recently please share how you did it/how much it cost. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello everyone! 👋
 Long story short, the hotel where I am going to stay in Hanoi in November gave me some good deals for a 2-day/1-night cruise on one of the ships mentioned in the title. The problem is that I can&#x27;t seem to figure out which one to choose...
 Le Theatre has a great dinner place with a piano and good outdoor areas on top, but I have seen comments about degradation problems and it not being very clean.
 Scarlet Pearl seems to be very new and clean, but it may have fewer outdoor areas...
 As for the itinerary, I think both are equivalent.
 Which one do you guys think I should choose?
 Thanks! 😁

 ​
 I know they just announced this but how would I pay for the fee to enter the town if I&#x27;m coming from the Da Nang airport around 9 p.m. and not entering the town until close to 10 p.m. if the ticket booths to enter the town close at 9:30 p.m.? How would I get to my hotel? Does my driver need to find a different route where I pay? Would the hotel help me?

                              <span>Có ai từng bị chính người nhà của mình bạo lực ngôn từ đến mức ám ảnh đến lúc bản thân đã trưởng thành không? Tôi thì có đấy. Tôi không tiện kể ở đây nhiều nhưng có một chuyện làm tôi nhớ mãi. Hồi nhỏ tôi rất thích xem các videos về DIY và thường rất táy máy làm theo, và thế là tôi lôi chiếc quần CŨ của mình ra để cắt tái chế thành một cái quần mới cho giống trên mạng, chuyện sẽ không có gì khi mẹ tôi phát hiện ra tôi cắt quần của mình và đi rêu rao với tất cả họ hàng là tôi rất rất hư, tôi học theo mấy con Đ.Ĩ trên mạng để trở thành những người như vậy (tôi thậm chí còn không mang cái quần đó ra đường). Và từ đó trở đi + nhiều chuyện nữa, tôi luôn có một nỗi lo với những người lớn tuổi hơn, tôi luôn ám ảnh việc người khác nghĩ gì về bản thân, tôi sợ người khác hiểu nhầm mình. Tôi luôn luôn mang trong mình một nỗi lo là tôi không giỏi, tôi không bao giờ được người khác công nhận, tôi không bao giờ được ai lắng nghe…

                              <span>I recently started dating an awesome Vietnamese guy. We get along great. I just had a couple questions on the best way to navigate a few cultural differences.
  
When we go out to eat, should I order my own food or just let him order and ask for extra plates?
 I have several mental health issues and my child is autistic. I am high functioning, receive mental health services, work full time and have full custody of my kids. I know it’s not appropriate to discuss emotions in many Asian cultures but I feel like it’d be the right thing to do to bring it up eventually. How should I do this? Should I be prepared for him to see me as weak and leave?
 What’s the best way to show him I care? My love language is touch but I wouldn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable in public. Would it be acceptable make a dessert for him? 
 What else do I need to know?
  
Thank you!!!

                              <span>Wanted to share this because there is almost zero criticism of this place anywhere I could find on the internet.
 We have spent two days here and have decided to abandoned ship and move on with the rest of the country. The main reason is that there is not much to do, and nowhere worth going to eat. 
 It obviously depends on what you like, but if it includes meat, you wont be getting that. Almost all meat here is not what it is advertised as, and will likely destroy your stomach the next day. We spent hours researching restaurants to eat at and compared to the rest of Vietnam, they are really quite pathetic. 4.7-5 star reviews on many restaurant are just an absolute joke. 
 Da Lat is a picturesque city with a nice climate this time of year. The hotels are all a bit tired and run down but that is to be expected considering the location. There are some nice bars hidden away for people to discover and you can do some small touristy activities like Crazy House, Coaster, Bike trips but that&#x27;s about it. 
 It is interesting that there are not many honest reviews containing criticism of any places in this country.

                              <span>Hello! My girlfriend is traveling in Vietnam and she is looking to buy some empty 100ml plastic bottles. 
 She wants to use these to fill so she can take some liquids on the plane. In Europe these small plastic bottles are sold at pharmacy and convenience stores but she is struggling to find them in Vietnam. 
 She will be in Hanoi so any specific store she could find it from there or any chain of a common store she could find such bottles at would be very helpful! 
 Thank you in advance!

 I&#x27;m a foreigner living in Vietnam now for 8 years. I&#x27;ve had my phone number since the first day or two that I moved here. I thought I showed my passport at TheGioididong when I got the card. But I guess not. I don&#x27;t know. Apparently, I was never registered. 
 I did not pick up the random phone calls over the past week as it said, suspected spam. And then April 1st. I have no signal. I try everything with the sim and refresh the network to get it back. Can&#x27;t do it. I figure out that the government is doing this thing, so I try to take a photo online for verification. Failed because I&#x27;m not Vietnamese, no registration card.

                              <span>seeing as vietnamese has so many loanwords from french colonization, albeit with differences ofc in spelling and pronunciation, do you think a vietnamese speaker would have an easier time learning french than say, a japanese speaker, due to the linguistic influences? (for example sa bông for savon, etc) would some vocabulary or language be recognizable or instinctual, or not at all? anyone here who speaks or is learning both, do you find similarities in the two languages?

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t too long ago when Singapore was a &quot;backwater&quot; town. South Korea was poor from the war, just like what happened to Vietnam. They worked hard and now Singapore and South Korean are rich.
 Do you think Vietnam will be rich like Singapore or South Korea? Why or why not?
 As a white American, I think Vietnam has the potential to get rich but not too fast please.
 Edit: thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

 I do not speak Vietnamese. 
 I live in Ho Chih Minh. 
 My school does not provide medical insurance.
 I need to do a blood test to test for
  
all vitamins and minerals (including vitamin B12 and vitamin D)
 
to test Testosterone and estrogen
 
to test for a potential condition called Sleep Apnea
 
 What are cheap hospitals or clinics in HCMC that can do cheap blood tests and visits to the doctor? I want to avoid expat prices.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve been living here for over a year now and I&#x27;m curious to know what are some recommended insurance plans that other Americans use that won&#x27;t break the bank. When I first came here I had world nomads, but they turned out to be no good after I was hospitalised and didn&#x27;t plan on returning home anytime back to the states. They said that exempt me from getting my claim. Then I had Safetywing but they are more of a (you pay now and file a claim and we will send you the money later) kind of deal. I&#x27;m living in HCMC and am just looking for a good insurance plan I can rely on if I do get injured and I can just go to the hospital (Probably Vinmec) and just get helped on the spot no questions asked. Can anyone give me any recommendations?

                              <span>Encryption is a technique for secure communication that converts plain text into a coded form that can only be deciphered with a secret key. Let&#x27;s explore some of encryption&#x27;s fun bits. Encryption works by using an algorithm to convert plaintext into ciphertext, which is unreadable without a corresponding decryption key.</span>

                              <span>Planning on taking this trip today leaving from Hue.. I read the road was very steep getting into/out of the park and was wondering if anyone had done it on a motorbike and could tell me if it’s ok to attempt or I should just take a guided tour? I’m very experienced on a motorcycle for what it’s worth. 
 Cảm ơn!

                              <span>I&#x27;m Vietnamese and I&#x27;ve eaten Nem Chua all my life and I&#x27;ve recently realized that Lao and Thai people have a very similar raw fermented Sausage that is called Naem. Is this a cognate where the word (possibly origin?) comes from the same source or is a coincidence? Vietnamese considers a lot of &quot;sausage meat&quot; related food &quot;Nem&quot; like in Nem Nuong and Nem Ran and I&#x27;m not sure if Thai and Lao people consider other meat Nem/Naem like in Vietnamese. I&#x27;ve done some research and fermented sausage eaten raw is unique to South East Asia so it would make sense if they come from a similar origin somewhere in South East Asia as opposed to the cooked Lap Xuong that comes from China.

We will not be using public transport because we will be so tired after 20 hrs of flying. So what is the best way to get a trustful ride to Ninh Binh? What is a ok price? Ive looked up some companies to book in advance but didnt find too much info.

                              <span>So I made the mistake of buying a couple of 32&quot; suitcases which measure 159cm and the max allowed is 158cm...I expect them to be 160-162cm when full, unexpanded. I will be sure to keep them under 50lbs total which I&#x27;ve read should get a pass at most airlines. But how strict is Vietnam airlines on checked luggage size?

                              <span>Any travellers use either DEET or Picaridin? I know DEET is probably the most effective but it&#x27;s so harsh it can eat through synthetic fibers if you&#x27;re not careful. Has anyone tried Picaridin in Vietnam and does it work? I hear Picaridin doesn&#x27;t hurt synthetic fibers, is not oily and doesn&#x27;t smell. Or maybe a mixture of both DEET on your skin and Picaridin sprayed on your clothes?

 I am close to the manager (male) and he speaks English, but the owner is a lady who doesn&#x27;t. 
 I want to get them a small gift when I leave. Should I get the manager, owner, or both a gift?
 Do you have any ideas what I can get. 
 Thank you

Where do you go for such vaccinations and are they free or how much are each vaccinations for the baby in Vietnam? I hear better vaccination doses cost more?

                              <span>Hello everybody! 
 ​
 In May, I have a flight that will have a 6 hour layover in Ho Chi Minh airport.
 ​
 I was wondering if anybody could tell me if this would be enough time to at least visit the city center or some interesting areas nearby the airport or if this is not enough.
 ​
 I&#x27;m traveling on a Mexican Passport so I would need to process an E-Visa which is 25 USD, which is not a problem at all but if it&#x27;s not even enough time to visit the outsides I would rather just transit in the airport.
 ​
 Thank you all!

                              <span>even if i’m living in an area with many ethnic minorities including other viet ppl, i will constantly get asked if im chinese or taiwanese. both of my parents are from vietnam (and supposedly both ethnically vietnamese) but we usually get mistaken for chinese or other east asian by other viet ppl. one time in a pho restaurant the owner was speaking to other clients in vietnamese and then switched to english when we arrived, thinking we were chinese. i know we did share a lot of colonial history with china but i’m not sure what determines the stereotype of features/appearance nowadays. other than the idea of SEA being “more tan” are there any significant phenotypic differences between chinese and vietnamese people? do you ever get mistaken for one or the other?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m writing a Pokemon story where one of the regions is inspired by modern-day Vietnam, and I was wondering what elements of Vietnam would work well in Pokemon. This includes towns, cities, gyms, and The Elite Four. I came here because people on this subreddit know more about Vietnam than me. I take inspiration from other cultures in my writing so I can learn more about said cultures, and I don&#x27;t wanna accidentally offend anyone. If anyone has suggestions on what elements of Vietnam would work well in my Pokemon story, please comment them down below!
 Here are the gyms and elite four:
 Gyms:
 Gym 1: Poison
 Gym 2: Psychic
 Gym 3: Electric
 Gym 4: Ground
 Gym 5: Normal
 Gym 6: Rock
 Gym 7: Dragon
 Gym 8: Steel
 ​
 Elite Four:
 Elite 1: Dark
 Elite 2: Grass
 Elite 3: Fighting
 Elite 4: Fairy
 Champion: Ice

                              <span>Hey all!
 As the title says, what&#x27;s something that might get my Hanoi friend to laugh and be confused by how I know that?
 It&#x27;s Monday there when I post this, so are there any good local memes?
  
Last year I started learning Russian for my friends in Kyrgyzstan. Now I&#x27;m also learning Vietnamese so I&#x27;ll be good when I visit.

                              <span>It’s been pretty long since I’ve been back to Vietnam. I’m 19 now and I know that the legal age has been set at 18, I still haven’t gotten my drivers license yet and low key forgot to get an id because I don’t really need anything in the us that would require an id. I know it’s a dumb question but like do most bars id now, when I go to Canada I never got id’d, so should I just lug around my passport or will I be set?

How safe is that particular bit of road for a very inexperienced rider? If it&#x27;s not safe what&#x27;s the best alternative to get those views?

                              <span>Hello all
 Me and my girlfriend are planning to visit your beautiful country this September. Probably from end of August till mid-September.
 However, I have found out that during this time Vietnam experiences relatively a lot of rain in some parts of the country. 
 We planned to visit Hanoi, Sapa, Ha long Bay, Ninh Binh, Hoi an, Hue and Phu quoc. Now I have read mixed information in the internet, so I thought I would ask maybe a local or someone who already visited Vietnam during this time period. Is end of August till mid-September a good time to visit these locations or which should I eventually skip?

                              <span>Em năm nay lớp 11, có chút năng khiếu vẽ vời, được sự ủng hộ từ gia đình nên hiện tại em đang học vẽ để thi năng khiếu.
 Ban đầu em có dự tính thi vào thiết kế đồ họa (em thích ngành này từ năm lớp 9) nhưng mà nghĩ lại và nghe mọi người khuyện nhủ thì em lại đang khá phân vân, liệu mình chọn ngành này sau này thu nhập có ổn định không, có đủ để gửi tiền hàng tháng về cho bố mẹ được không...có lẽ em thích là một chuyện nhưng nếu sau này ra trường lương lại ít hơn số tiền bỏ ra thì em thấy có lỗi với bố mẹ lắm ạ..
 Em đang phân vân giữa kiến trúc, ,thiết kế đồ họa, thiết kế nội thất. Ba ngành này em học ngành nào cũng được và sẽ quyết tâm đến cùng ( em có thế mạnh về vẽ và Toán Lý, biết sử dụng pts)
 Mọi người tư vẫn cho em với ạ
 em cảm ơn🌹

 Are there opportunities to go outdoor rock climbing with guided tours or organisations along the way.

 Next up Danang if you have recommendations for bars and clubs? Unfortunately We&#x27;re there during the week, Tuesday to Thursday.

                              <span>Saw some photos of the Vung Tau giant lobster sculptures, but never managed to pinpoint the location.
 Is anyone familiar with these sculptures? Was it a temporary exhibit? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>good day my fellows, it&#x27;s me again the peasant going to college at 24. 6 months have gone by since i started and it was okay enough. but here comes the problem. as i mentioned in my previous post, this school is unfortunately a good place for shitheads to avoid military service. and i happened to bump into one. this cunt is a fucking retarded coward. that wouldnt be much of a problem if he werent mentally unstable. he faked my facebook account and insulted a few classmates, and fake some classmates&#x27; accounts to insult me( maybe because i refused to let him copy during tests). the insults are pretty heavy. i had thought of just letting an iron bar do the talking since i failed reasoning with him(understandably) but the &quot;mentally unstable&quot; part worries me. what if he always brings a knife, what if he bites me when im off guard,.... those funny thoughts are all over my head. but seriously im an adult now. violence is not a smart choice especially for me who doesnt have time to waste and i dont lower myself to the same level with a shit stirring loser. what do i do now. i doubt the police would handle this. i want to but i cant put up with this shit because i know he wont stop. this douche is persistent.

I&#x27;ve really only heard bad things about English centers like VUS and ILA but not sure if what I&#x27;ve heard is accurate... I also have generally just heard bad things about private tutors - like basically they just want to get paid to drink coffee and chat for an hour. What would you guys recommend as the best place or method to study English in Saigon?

                              <span>As the title says I’m currently looking for friends in my age group. Been here for a month and just been visiting family. I’m planning to live in HCMC and look for a English teaching job soon. I’m fluent in English and Vietnamese (just can’t read or write) I’m open to meeting different people. I can be wholesome and also party(although i have slowed down in my late 20s) I’ve traveled from the south up north 3 years ago so I’m familiar with the landscape. Did the whole backpacking thing already. My interest includes art, tattooing, fishing, motorcycles, tech, music, traveling. I’m pretty open minded just looking for some new friends(usually more extroverted) but just been with family. If you’re chill respectful and have decent morals I’m free to meet up. Have a great day :)

 I&#x27;ve noticed, every year is getting more and more difficult, especially at public schools. I teach at a talent school every day, and I constantly face problems with discipline and respect.
 I&#x27;ve been through students saying &quot;Fuck you, teacher&quot;, students showing me the middle finger, students talking back to me in a disrespectful way and the latest, being called đần. My name is Aidan, so during breaktime, a student decided to write Aiđần on my pencil case while I wasn&#x27;t in the class. 
 These days, I just feel a complete lack of respect from students and Vietnamese teachers. I know foreign teachers get paid a lot more than Vietnamese teachers, …</span>

                              <span>I am traveling to HCMC/Saigon this summer and am from the US. I will be studying and working abroad at an internship. 
 I want to know if it is appropriate to mention, or talk about my interest in engaged buddhism and Thich Nhat Hanhs work in the work place, particularly in education field/working with children? (or just in general)
 Is he a figure that is respected by Vietnamese people? Or will I get judged or looked at differently after mentioning my interest in his books and values? Might it be offensive to mention? I also don’t want to offend anyone!!
 I know this is a very very generalized statement, but it’s something I have been thinking about a lot, especially when learning about Thays history with the Vietnamese government etc.
 Thank you so much in advance!!

 Sad to see they no longer offer original recipe chicken, just crispy chicken and spicy crispy. Flava is ok but I really miss the original recipe chicken. The smell is just so good.

                              <span>Hi everyone! This summer, I&#x27;ll move to Hanoi (from Rome) for a four-year diplomatic posting. I&#x27;m super excited to explore Hanoi and the rest of Vietnam and have a few questions that you can hopefully help me answer.
  
Are there any essentials that are hard to get by in Hanoi? My employer will arrange a moving company, so I have the option of stashing up in Rome before the move. 
 
Where should I live? I am looking for a neighbourhood with a good connection to the Old Quarter for my daily commute (see Q3). I&#x27;m coming alone and would prefer an area with a local vibe that is relatively quiet and clean. My employer pays for my accommodation so fortunately I have a wider choice budget wise. 
 
Is my e-bike enough or should I buy a scooter? I currently own a VanMoof S3 with a top speed of roughly 30 km/h.
 
I have the opportunity of following two weeks of full-time language classes. Can you recommend any schools? A school slightly outside of Hanoi with room and board is possible too. 
 
How to get social? I am no noob to making new friends in new environments, but any tips are very welcome!
 
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>I found Vietnamese businesses like restaurants and coffee shops abroad to be really unfriendly. On several occasions we went inside a Vietnamese restaurant and were completely ignored. So when we finally went on vacation to Vietnam, we were not expecting much in terms of customer service...
 However in Vietnam the customer service turned out to be fantastic! Restaurants and coffee shop workers were really friendly. Hostel owners would treat you like family. Even tiny food stall owners were super kind. Locals would help you order food and give you suggestions. It was really like some kind of Customer Service Fairy Tale
 Then I came back from the vacation, and decided to go to a Vietnamese coffee shop. The cashier didn&#x27;t say anything at all when I ordered.
 I&#x27;m just wondering why there is such a huge discrepancy in customer service between businesses in Vietnam and abroad

                              <span>The situation was - I booked a ride then had to cancel it, but the driver I cancelled on then messaged me on WhatsApp and then called me on WhatsApp too. But I NEVER gave him my contact number. Is this normal? I’ve been using Grab for a few weeks now and have only contacted drivers through the app. The Grab app says that it has “number masking” so that my actual number isn’t visible. Thanks

                              <span>Let&#x27;s all take a moment to appreciate the majesty of the Vietnamese spoon. Coming from north America I thought they looked funny.
 But damn can they hold some serious volume and don&#x27;t spill shit everywhere. 
 I&#x27;ve even used it to grind blueberries etc. in a bowl like a mortar and pestle. 
 Amazing. And they stack so nicely!

                              <span>My wife and I run a building supplies center focused on contractors and home builders outside of a major city in Western Canada. After almost a decade of importing goods from China my wife and I have decided to visit your beautiful country in May and reorganize our supply chain into SE Asia due to ideological differences with the PRC. 
 We already have a scheduled visit with RC Group to discuss flooring / tile and would love to hear this subs recommendations for other manufacturers. Our main distributed products are vinyl flooring , plywood, kitchen cabinets , counter tops , kitchen hardware , tile and biomass boiler systems. 
 Really excited to come support your country and work towards moving 100% of our manufacturing to SE Asia.

                              <span>Xin chao ban! I&#x27;m wondering about how some of the Indigenous religious traditions overlap (if at all) as I reconnect with precolonial heritage.
 A lot of the articles I read seem to put more emphasis on Len Dong / spirit mediumship happening in the North but also with a handful of practitioners in diaspora like in California of the US who have been trained or came into the role through heredity (e.g. family has a history of it).
 For Ca Ong/whale worship, a lot of coastal villages including the one part of my family came from still do it, but we&#x27;re disconnected from the culture due to deaths in the family and immigration away from the country. And it seems each village celebrates their festival differently at different moons (TraVinh where some of my relatives were from for example is supposedly on the 3rd lunar month, others do the 6th), and some blend Buddhist traditions with the mourning of a deceased whale, while others remain rooted in Cham culture, and others potentially adopted the Nguyen Dynasty&#x27;s official policies to worship Can Ong but kept their own local practices too.
 So I&#x27;m wondering what the ceremonies and protocols are like, and if the two religions ever overlap, what the ceremonies entail, and what route might be good to inquire further to connect with first.

                              <span>Hello. I’m of Vietnamese ancestry, but was born in the United States, and have lived there all my life. However, I visit Vietnam for holiday periodically, and after hearing my (limited) Vietnamese skills, I’m often asked by locals: “Are you Viet Kieu?”
 It seems like a simple question, but I’ve received different answers from locals, relatives, and the internet. To make it more confusing, the meaning seems to have change from older to younger generations. Can you help?
 Is Viet Kieu: - someone born in Vietnam that now lives overseas - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry who now wishes to live in Vietnam again?
 And more importantly (for me)…does Viet Kieu have a bad connotation for locals?
 Thanks for your help!
 Edit: Added small detail for clarity. And wow, thank you for all the thoughtful responses.

 I look online and tickets are at least 2000$ for June. That is insane. Good news is, there are ways to save money, so what are some ways, thinking outside of the box, to save money?
 -Signing up for credit card bonus (is this true, have any of you done this?) -best day to fly in? -best day to fly out? 
 I fly out of Laguardia or Albany, but if another airport is cheaper, that is close, please let me know. 
 Im full time student, planning to go in June 14th-July 3

 Sometimes the option to &quot;re-route&quot; is blocked by yet another feral dog who came out into the street behind you. 
 I&#x27;ve noticed they have a tendency to follow a person if they try to walk away. And obviously running is stupid beyond all belief. 
 Is there a safe way to pass one of these possibly rabid beasts?

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning on backpacking Vietnam soon and want to do the Ha Giang loop in late April or Early May. I would like advice on if I should it solo or with a small group. I have seen from other posts that some groups from places like Jasmine or QT are sometimes as large as 30 people. To me that doesn&#x27;t sound like a great time, but I would like the social aspect that comes from a group. Does anyone have recommendations for a company that does tours of less than 10? Or anyone that had an experience where they started solo but met people along the way to drive with.

I know they have a different snake compared to the smaller ones and I hope these ones won’t cause problems. Does anyone have any experience bringing these specific ones back to the US?

                              <span>Hi all, I will be traveling to Vietnam soon and wonder if linen clothes is a thing in your country? I see there is a lot of tailored clothes, suits, silk etc., but can&#x27;t find much about linen? I had little time to organise myself and would like to buy shorts, trousers, shirts - in linen, locally.
 Is this a thing in Vietnam?
 EDIT: I wonder what makes you downvote this post, when asking a simple question about your country. please tell me how I offended your personality and made your day bad by asking about clothes for personal use...

                              <span>As a foreigner living in Vietnam, it’s hard to learn about Vietnam religious traditions, despite their ever-present nature (e.g., shrines in stores, schools and homes; temples and pagodas all over the place; lunar calendar holidays; statues; music)
 Are there any YouTube channels, books, or articles—any learning materials—that teach the ignorant (me) about Vietnamese religious traditions?
 My partner and I are raising our child here (2 years old currently), and we want them to be as understanding as possible of the Vietnamese religious traditions. We’d even like to put up a family altar if we can figure out how to do it right.

 I tried to contact some companies found online, but they either required me to fill excessive document works (even asking me how many books I am going to ship) and notarize various IDs, or refused to let me pack myself (I really don&#x27;t want other people touch my stuff, which is also the reason I choose ocean freight, basically no inspection.)
 Thanks for the help!

                              <span>We’ve decided to move to VN. I am VK. Husband and I are in early 40’s. We have a 6 year old. We are planning to send her to international school and since we want to live near her school, it seems as our two options will be D2 or D7. These aren’t the neighborhoods I would pick but we want to live near the school to make commuting less annoying. We are having a hard time deciding between the two and would love any insight! 
 What are the nice apt buildings in D7 in the Phú Mỹ Hưng area? Some of the buildings in D2 had such nice facilities and landscaping and I am struggling to find something comparable in D7. We’d like a building that’s lively, lots of kids.
 What I love about D1, 2, 3 are the cute coffee shops and small stores. And the street food. D7 doesn’t seem to have any of that, right? Just wanna make sure I’m not missing something…
 Not sure if anyone on this subreddit is a parent but would love to know if the families in D2 and D7 are younger families or older and more established with lots of kids?

                              <span>Anyone in Vietnam familiar with any process that a homeowner can go through that pays them to install a cellular tower on their rooftop?
 Background: Family has one of the tallest houses in the neighborhood, so installing a cellular tower would drastically improve reception for the entire neighborhood. Here in the states, mobile providers will pay rent for the privilege. I see many of these cell towers installed in TPHCM, so wondering if that was a &quot;thing&quot; in Vietnam.

                              <span>Any backpacker/traveler who is planning to travel across VN and needs a local as a guide/translator, then I&#x27;m willing to be yours. Since my main purpose in doing this is to practice my English, I won&#x27;t require any charge from you. But I have to make it clear that I&#x27;ll need you to cover all the travel expenses such as food, and accommodation fees on the way for me, because I&#x27;m quite broke now and can&#x27;t afford to pay those. And in return, being a local I have experience about what to avoid while being in the country, as I&#x27;m familiar with the law and many other things here, as well as knowing which places are cheap and safe, which are overpriced, and which services are good and which scams to avoid.
 I don&#x27;t mind traveling by motorbike, for I have one of my own. so feel free to reach out and DM me :) I&#x27;m currently living in Ha Long, a tourist coastal city located 150km to the east of Hanoi. If you are visiting or planning to visit my city, we can also meet and befriend and I will show you around if you&#x27;re interested.

                              <span>A common issue on development teams is that an application might work on one developer’s computer but not on the others. Luckily, there&#x27;s Docker, a popular containerization technology. It works by packing up all the components needed to run the application and then executing the application in an isolated environment.</span>

Passing props means sending data from one component to another. It&#x27;s a good way to make sure that data gets to the right place in a React application.</span>

                              <span>My family is buying property just outside of HCMC. This property is so that my in-laws can retire back to Vietnam. We need to send just over 100K USD from the USA. Wiring/bank transfer of the money would be our safest bet I am assuming. If this is the case, will I be able to open a bank account in Vietnam with only a family visa? I am not able to get Vietnam citizenship reinstated. However my wife is, and she is currently waiting on the paper work to be finished. The property will be the in-law’s name. So I am not worried about loosing said property. Next question that I have is once money is in hand, in Vietnam, what is normally done/happens to transfer the title? Is it a red flag if a newly built condo does not have the red book,title? I was told that this is because the condo was recently built and at this time all units are not sold or finished yet. Though I do know that people have been living in that building for ả least 5 years. One would think that my in-laws would be able to answer these questions. But they have been living outside of Vietnam for 40 years. And I have no close relative alive in Vietnam to ask. Please excuse any poor wording or grammatical errors. Writing coherently in is still a struggle.

I am already prepared that i can’t cycle back on Sunday. I was thinking is it possible to bring a bicycle on a local bus back to Hanoi? I’ve taken the local bus 71 before also and it got quite full that time. I could also use a taxi but i heard it would cost over 1mil VND and im thinking what would be most convinient way.
 Thank you in advance! 😊

 I really want to buy a record from an online shop in Vietnam and ship it to USA. How can I do this? I tried emailing the shop directly, and they said they can&#x27;t ship to USA. Does anyone here have experience with this?
 Thank you!

                              <span>- Many motorcyclists don&#x27;t wear a helmet, especially during rush hour, and traffic police just ignore them, and they even pass right next to them.
 - Many will turn right or left at the foot of a bridge, even cars. What&#x27;s worse, there are vendors on a freaking bridge!
 - Being on the phone while driving or riding. Worse, texting!
 - Cutting corners is a very common practice. 
 - Double parking, particularly in narrow streets.
 - The most dangerous, I think, is beating the red light, especially without a helmet.
 ​
 I hope the government will have stricter traffic regulations. These situations appear to be everywhere, at least, in where I live.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;ve been creating a playlist on Spotify with music from Southeast Asia, including both traditional and more recently recorded songs. I wanted to kindly ask you for any songs, artists, or records you would recommend me to add to the playlist. 
 I am grateful for any suggestions - except maybe noisy EDM or cheesy mainstream pop! :p It doesn&#x27;t matter from which Southeast Asian nation the music is from, I prefer explore songs that are sung in a native language, though, and not in English - if the music even includes voice recordings. 
 Regarding music which has been released in recent decades, I do particularly enjoy indie rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and post punk, among many other genres.
 When it comes to traditional/older recordings, I appreciate to explore basically everything! &#x3D;) 
 So, many thanks for any recommendations in advance! ;) Here&#x27;s a link to the playlist if someone&#x27;s interested in listening to it, too:

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently bought a few houseplants, such as the one in the photo. I have no idea what kind if plant it is, just that it is not doing so well. The leaves are turning brown and dropping off. 
 I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months, and kept it inside our apartment, watering every few days so that the soil doesn&#x27;t completely dry out. I&#x27;ve moved it outside as I thought it might need more sunlight, but it still is struggling.
 Any tips please? I hav no idea on how to care for plants in tropical climates. Also, what is this plant called?
 Thanks!

                              <span>My home country is the United States, I just finished a teaching contract in Thailand and plan to travel to Vietnam before coming back to Thailand for 2 months (I will extend my visa on arrival 1x). I have proof of my flight back to Thailand, but will I need to buy my ticket from Thailand to the USA to get on my flight to Vietnam? If so can I get a flight that is 2 months after my reentry into Thailand? If not I may need to get a flight where I can adjust the dates later. Let me know your suggestions if this is required. Thank you.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m considering visiting Hanoi and scoping out how accessible it might be for someone in a manual wheelchair who&#x27;d like to avoid driving. I currently live in Yosemite National Park as its only employee in a wheelchair, so I&#x27;m used to standards below what&#x27;s technically legal in U.S. cities, and am used to having difficulty with transportation, groceries, etc. I have some specific questions, but in general I&#x27;d really appreciate some perspective from people with mobility impairments of any kind. Examples of commentary I&#x27;d find very useful:
 Do expats see many disabled people among middle class society?
 Are we treated differently in ways that are negative?
 Would I have a harder time getting or maintaining a job because of a visible disability? (Will I be discriminated against more than I already am in the U.S.?)
 Would it be difficult to find an apartment that&#x27;s more or less accessible without it being considered a luxury or additional spending requirement?

                              <span>Long story short, I&#x27;m going to HCMC and will be meeting my Vietnamese girlfriend (who lives with her parents).
 I&#x27;d like to stay near District 1 but it&#x27;s my understanding most hotels won&#x27;t let her visit by law because we&#x27;re not married. She says it&#x27;s probably fine and she can talk to the desk and tell them she&#x27;s actually my GF to smooth it over but won&#x27;t research ahead of time for me which is frustrating since she&#x27;s so confident this will work anywhere (internet tells me otherwise).
 I found some sites listing &quot;girl friendly&quot; hotels, but they all look pretty dumpy (what you&#x27;d expect for that crowd).
 Does anyone know any decent 4-star or so hotels in District 1 that would allow her? I&#x27;ve started to email some places in the meantime. Budget is around $75-150USD/night which should be plenty. I&#x27;d like to not stay in a rundown brothel which many of the places that allow guests seem to resemble.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was in Vietnam for the first couple weeks of March and have been back in the U.S. for a little over a week now. I cannot stop thinking about my time there, and can&#x27;t seem to shake the feeling that I wish I was back. I was hoping this feeling would have subsided by now.
 My question is, for those of you who have been through this before,
 what do??

                              <span>Mom is visiting her family and will be arriving there tomorrow, an emergency came up with her relative and they&#x27;re no longer able to pick her up. She has to go from Da Nang to Hue, looked on Da Nang&#x27;s airport site for recommendations, does anyone here have any others? I saw Grab mentioned, but she barely knows how to use her smartphone, so that may be out. She also has quite a bit of luggage and two other individuals coming along ,so a large van will be needed. Is there anything I could do on my end (U.S.) to book something? Or just give her one of these numbers? Thank you.

                              <span>Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but this is the direct experience I&#x27;ve had whilst living in Hanoi for the last 4 months. I have my local vinmart, and another vinmart down the road and a circle k. I have to say, my experience of customer service has been the worst I have ever experienced. At the one store, the same girl (in her late 20&#x27;s), just looks at me and has this look of contempt, of anger almost, grabs my items, scans them then points to the screen in a really &#x27;I can&#x27;t be bothered, hurry up&#x27; way. She grabs my card scans it, prints the receipt and just hands it to me, not even a smile, a nod, a goodbye, no eye contact. The other day she takes the basket and just throws it on the floor. Then again, tonight, the other store, I go in, the young man didn&#x27;t say one word to me the entire time. No hello, no thank you, no goodbye (in Vietnamese.. I don&#x27;t expect English)... And just slammed the receipt on the table and continued chatting. My question is, are these people taught by their companies to observe any form of customer service? Is it because they are shy? (even though they stare at me and even once sighed at me for taking too long to use my phone app to pay even though their card machine wasn&#x27;t working)? Is it because they have no idea what to say to foreigners? Because I&#x27;ve been to other countries and a simple head nod, or even small gesture to acknowledge the customer and make him or her feel welcome isn&#x27;t so difficult is it? Now I rather hate going shopping now. It is not an enjoyable situation and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has the same experience in Hanoi. As a customer spending money in these stores I feel entitled to some form of customer service. I dont expect much, but a simple xin Chào, cam on or even a smile to the foreigners who are living and working hard here (or even tourists spending their money here) isn&#x27;t so difficult... Or is it?

                              <span>I am staying in Ha Long Bay for a few nights, and will be back in Hanoi on friday before flying out. I am wondering where I can get a pith helmet for a good price/quality? I see many locals wearing them around here and I think they look awesome!
 I am referring to something like this:

 I also would like to know if I would appear as a silly farang for wearing one of these? Would it come off more costumey or just as a cool hat I got on vacation?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I was a in Hanoi. Just a regular massage, nothing special or &quot;happy ending&quot;. Ticket was 300K VND for 1.5 hour. I gave the receptionist (who handles the tip for the massage person) 50K VND. She said that&#x27;s too little, usually the tip is 150K, 200K or even 300K. Is this true for a regular massage? Whatever happened to tipping 10% of the bill? Why do I have to 50% to 100% of the bill?

 Is it how an American, British or European sees $10 (£10, €10)?

                              <span>Can someone tell me how is the situation with using cars/cash in Vietnam? I have been recently Thailand and Taiwan and at both places it was mainly cash, card use was super limited and withdrawing cash was very expensive. I was kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t take more Euros/Pounds with me. How are the ATM fees in Vietnam and how common is it to pay with cards?

                              <span>Met a guy in his late 40’s from Vietnam this weekend and I’m trying to figure out how to spell his name. Over the phone I had no idea I wasn’t speaking to an American and heard Jim and didn’t think anything of it. When we met in person I realized he was of Asian descent and when I heard him say his name I realized it wasn’t Jim. 
 The best I could describe his name would be how the English word “You” would sound with an “M” at the end, Youm. He said it’s pretty common for people mistake it for Jim. But I’m having trouble figuring out how his name is actually spelled. 
 I’m hoping this is a common enough name that I could easily get an answer here. Thank you in advance.

Mắm tôm and similar should not be an option because I need to make sure I can check it on the airplane.
 
We usually use it to dip BBQ meats. Usually venison during hunting season or beef or pork ribs.
 
Great if I can order it online. I don&#x27;t live in HCMC but occasionally get there for a day or two.
 
 As for myself, what do you suggest for a very hot/spicy sauce? For me even the Cholimex &quot;tương ớt cay nồng&quot; is not very spicy though it&#x27;s almost there.

 I would only stay in VN for 1 or 2 months.

 I just accepted a job offer and will be moving to Nha Trang soon. 
 Are there any insights, tips, fun secret places, ect that you can think of to share with me as I prepare to move? 
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of research, but I&#x27;ve found nothing beats anecdotal experience. 
 Much obliged!

                              <span>Hi friends,
 I am interested in moving to Vietnam and working for a year. I have quite sensitive health problems, blepharitis and quite serious eczema; right now I have them both fairly under control but am quite concerned that the pollution will cause it to flair.
 Ideally, I want to move to Hanoi, but am also considering Saigon as I heard it&#x27;s better air .I fear the air might affect my health problems. I would happily buy an air filter, mask, and try my best to avoid rush hour.
 Am I worrying too much? Is a year short enough to be relatively safe?
 What are your experiences, thank you!

                              <span>Trying to keep it general lest it gets flagged as advertising. I usually get very few matches (well under ten, and then mostly single moms or scammers). My guess is since my looks are very average, plus I&#x27;m on the extremely skinny side of things. Trying to figure out if it would be worthwhile to invest some money. What difference have the following made for you?
  
Paid account
 Having professional photos taken
 Anything else?
  
I&#x27;m in HCMC (and limit my search to there) if that makes any difference.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am heading to vietnam for 2 weeks of “backpacking” travel. All of my accommodations have been paid for already, I was just wondering how much cash I should take out for food basically and some souvineers. I keep seeing mixed numbers. I plan to do Ha Long Bay day tour and probably a few others. My travel style is usually budget travel and I rarely drink alcohol. If anyone can give me a ball park number it would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I was on a 12 hour ride for my first time in a sleeper bus and it was the most uncomfortable part of my trip. The bus was just shaky, the bus driver drove like a maniac, honking all the time, slammed on the breaks a lot and sending me flying off my seat a few times. I eventually ended up getting a headache, dizziness and just couldn’t sleep without worrying that this bus was gonna crash or something.

I have been here for about two and a half weeks - and we have not been off to the best start. Due to several factors, it&#x27;s looking very likely that my work permit and TRC will not finish in time. To top it off, it could cost me my job.
 I got a US FBI background check before coming, but unfortunately was informed on my second day in the country that it is invalid for Vietnam and I need to get a local check. I was informed there are two ways to go about this - apply for a residence certificate from the police and apply for the criminal check in person with that residence certificate, or do it all online via a private agency.

                              <span>I (21M) was born in 2001 in HCMC Vietnam and my mother&#x27;s side originated from the HCMC region whilst my father&#x27;s side originated from the North (he was born in Hanoi by the way). Even though both my parents, both my sisters (33F, 21F), and I have visited Hanoi several times, most of my mother&#x27;s side has never visited North Vietnam yet (north of 17th parallel), despite the fact most of her relatives still live in Vietnam (from what I have heard from my mother, her side is quite wealthy and many of her relatives are business owners). Many of them only went around the Southern third of Vietnam and the furthest North many of them has visited is Nha Trang/Dalat. In fact, for all of my mother&#x27;s relatives in the US (most came during the mid-late 1990s), none of them went above Nha Trang and half of them only visited Vietnam once or twice afterwards.
 Despite the fact I have only lived in Vietnam for 5 years before moving to Russia to study in 2006 and subsequently moving to the US at 11 in 2012, I have visited Vietnam several times afterwards (my most recent trip was in 2019 by the way), and I have visited the following places:
 Ca Mau, Can Tho, Long Xuyen, Ben Tre, Vung Tau, HCMC, Tay Ninh, Phan Thiet, Dalat, Nha Trang, Buon Ma Thuot, Tuy Hoa, Quy Nhon, Pleiku, Quang Ngai, Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Vinh, Thanh Hoa, Nam Dinh, Hanoi, Hai Duong, Haiphong, Ha Long, Thai Nguyen, Sapa
 ​
  
I am curious if it is common for Vietnamese people to have never visited the Northern half (North of 16/17 parallel)
 Plus, how common is it for Vietnamese Americans to never return to Vietnam or only return there once since moving to the US

                              <span>The plugs, electrical outlets, power strips etc. Why are they so hard to plug anything in?? Every time I try to plug in a lamp, charger, appliance it&#x27;s a battle of strength. Am I dumb? (Very possible) Is there a trick to it? (God I hope so) Two prong, three prong, doesn&#x27;t matter. I feel like I am going to break something every time! I even bought new power strips and it&#x27;s the same thing.

                              <span>Hi, I live abroad and would like to create a basic bank account in Vietnam so that I can buy stuff when I&#x27;m visiting. Just a free account with a debit card and a reliable mobile app. Can anyone recommend a good bank and product please?
 I want to buy train tickets (e.g. Ha Noi to Hai Duong) and someone told me that I should buy them in a bank mobile app. Do all banks have this feature?
 Last question, when Vietnamese people go to the shops and they &quot;chuyển khoản&quot;, do they mean paying with a card or is that some other way of paying that I don&#x27;t know?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi! I am in North Vietnam and I’m thinking to go to Ha Giang tomorrow on a motorcycle loop tour for 2 days. However, the weather looks like it’s going to rain most of the days with temperatures between 20-24 C. 
 Is it worth it even in the rain? 
 Thanks ❤️

                              <span>We are a family of two adults and two tweens. We will be in North Vietnam for a week first week of June. Plan to be in Hanoi and Ninh Binh. On the fence about Ha Long Bay. The thought of it is exciting, and seems like a bucket list thing, but not sure if a 1 night cruise will be enjoyable if the bay is overcrowded. 
 Are there 5 star cruises there that take a less crowded route?
 We don&#x27;t care so much about spending the night on the boat but seems like that is the standard way to enjoy it.
 I hear there are other bays nearby but that they are not any less crowded.
 Tips?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Xin chào!
 I am visiting Hanoi from now until friday, the 31st of april, and I am interested in getting a custom tailored mens suit! I just want a jacket and pants, but if the price is good I could be convinced to get a shirt and/or vest too. I am thinking of choosing a charcoal wool/wool blend material.
 I am in my mid-20s but want it to be a versatile suit, so nothing either super vintage nor super modern; Regular length and medium-width notched lapels for the jacket and a slim-straight cut for the pants would be ideal. I also would like the suit to have some stretch, as I often get uncomfortable with the restrictive/stiff feel of store-bought suits.
 My budget would ideally be 5million VND, but a lot of talk online about this stuff is from pre-covid times, so I don&#x27;t know if that is a realistic number. Please correct my expectations if they are unrealistic.
 What tailors would be appropriate for what I am looking for, and what prices can I expect? Also: do I need to buy the fabric separately on my own, or will that be included in the tailor bill? Or would it be cheaper to buy on my own? 
 Any and all advice is much appreciated! Cảm ơn : )

                              <span>Hi everyone, I’m taking a trip to Vietnam soon and trying to workout my itinerary and would love some advice!
 So on the 4th of May, the plan is to take the night train from Dong Hoi up to Tam Coc. I’ve realised maybe 1 day is not enough for Tam Coc. Plus it’s a long journey from Tam Coc up to Ha Giang…
 After Tam Coc, the plan was to do the Ha Giang loop, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, however if we stay the extra day in Tam Coc, plus the long journey, I’m not sure we will have 4 days to do the loop. 
 We have to be in Hai Phong Bay at 11:30am on Monday 10th for a trip to Cat Ba.
 So here is my question:
 Should we skip Tam Coc all together, get up to Ha Giang and just do the loop for as long as we can? Should we do the 2 days in Tam Coc and just do a smaller loop of Ha Giang? Should I stick to 1 day in Tam Coc and the 4 day loop of Ha Giang?
 It looks like if we decide to go to Tam Coc, we will have to get a night bus up to Ha Giang. And of course then another night bus from Ha Giang down to Hanoi. Lot of night travel - is it too much? Should we ease up and save stuff for another visit?
 Thanks for your help!

Met many people so far and would love to continue that in Vietnam. I’m in hanoi for some days than I will move south. Any tips for events, people or social profiles in very welcome.

                              <span>I want to bring more than 5K back to Vietnam and I heard that the best way to do this is to bring Bitcoin. My question is, how do I convert it to VND for the best price? I heard that there are a few ATMS in Saigon, but they have high fees. Are there any exchange that I can use to convert Bitcoin into VND?
 ​
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;ve been saving up for a trip for a very long time and I have my heart set on going to Vietnam. I&#x27;m 21F, Indian, and have a BA degree in History and am currently in my last year of law school. I have been seriously contemplating the idea of enrolling in a CELTA course and English as a foreign language full time, but this particular trip is going to have to be limited to 1 month. 
 I am looking at volunteering to to teach English or working with children in any capacity. I understand that my lack of certification and the duration of the trip is going to be an issue but I would be happy to be involved in any sort of volunteer work. I have previously worked as a college counselor for underprivileged children and been a paid tutor at an IELTS center in my city. 
 I have managed to find a few workaway opportunities that help you assist English language teachers and work on curriculum development but I&#x27;m not sure how legit they are. Please help connect me to any volunteer opportunities in the month of June.

                              <span>Hi! I have been riding motorbikes and scooters in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia without issues. Just arrived in Vietnam, rented a scooter in Mui Ne and within the first 15 minuntes I was taken to the police station. Tried to haggle the fine but in the end I left with 500k less in my pocket. 
 Given that I am not going to be able to produce a valid licence since Im already here and my IDP has only a B stamp: Are there any tricks to avoid being stopped or prevent the fine at all? I&#x27;m going to be renting bikes in Dalat, Da Nang, Nihn Binh and Ha Giang, so would rather not pay 500k each time.
 If not able to avoid police encounters, what would the minimum reasonable &quot;fine&quot; that I could settle for?

 Should I go for bigger store like Phong Vu, Nguyen Kim or try smaller store like Tin Hoc Ngoi Sao, Gear.vn. 
 Still trying to adjust to my new life here in Vietnam. Thank you all
 Edit: sorry I forgot to mention. I’m living in HCM now so any place in HCM is highly appreciated

 So I wanted to ask if anyone had alternative motorbiking suggestions in north Vietnam? Theres a 5 day window in our itinerary between stops at Sapa and Ha Long Bay, so any suggestions of beginner friendly routes lasting 2-5 days would be awesome!

                              <span>Hello everyone, my wife and I will be staying in phu Quoc for the next few days and are near the Ong Lang beach. We’re doing a relatively budget holiday so staying in a cheapesh place half an hour walk away from the beach.
 Most of the other discussion I see mention resorts for beaches but are the public beaches here good? My wife suffers a bit from too much sun so we wouldn’t mind having umbrellas and facilities at the beaches! 
 We will also spend a couple of days towards the south west of the island if anyone jas recommendations?
 Thanks a lot in advace!

                              <span>Hey fellow Vietnamese! I spent a wonderful 10 day trip in Hanoi a month ago. I loved it and I want to be back for another remote working period, maybe in Da Nang. My only concern is the internet speed, as my job relies heavily on Zoom meetings. Last time the connection was bumpy, I had some serious issues one day and I am concerned. I read the news and know about internet cables, but I prefer first hand information. So here I am, any feedback will be much appreciated. Thanks a lot!
