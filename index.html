                              <span>Hi there! I have just started my part-time Vietnamese classes in preparation for a job posting in Hanoi. My teacher recommends Duolingo for expanding my vocabulary outside of class, but friends have had mixed experiences with Duolingo for other languages. Do you agree that Duolingo is the best Vietnamese learning app or should I consider another?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello everybody !
 I&#x27;m from France and I visited Vietnam in october 2018. I loved your country so much, it must have been the best travel of my life. After that, I got interested in vietnamese culture, the food, the language, the music. I listened to popular vietnamese songs on Youtube. Not the oldschool, historically famous ones. More like the hits of the last few years.
 ​
 I remember listening to one song in particular and I just can&#x27;t find it anymore. It wasnt the best song or anything, but it bugs me because I can see the video clip in my head and it&#x27;s frustrating. Here is what I know about it : 
  
The main singer was a man 
 It was released before the end of 2019
 The clip is at night, in a big city. A man and a woman are having fun, getting drunk, playing pool. And there&#x27;s an underlying love story
 I think he&#x27;s hoping something happens betweem them 
 I think it was rap. But maybe not 100% rap ? 
  
I know it&#x27;s not much... But if it rings a bell to anyone, it would make my day and remind me great memories ! Thank you

                              <span>Hello, it’s been a few of days since I moved to HCMC, I put up in District 4 and was looking to buy some cigarettes. Asked around in the convenience stores and from the little bit we could communicate through google translate, all of them said they don’t sell cigarettes in the area. Will I get some at Circle K in District 1 or just from roadside sellers? (Haven’t gone beyond my area because work ends at dusk, and I did go out the first day after work but got spooked because got approached by different men twice asking where I am from and stuff so not stepping out in the evening anymore)

I thought i could feature a story of one person that experienced this. If any of you happen to know someone that would like to share their story, please let me know. Thanks for the help!

                              <span>We had heard to just pick up a SIM card at the airport when we landed in Ho Chi Minh. From our research we saw that Viettel was the best so we walked over to the Viettel stall to the far right of the airport when you get off and bought a SIM card. They put it in my phone and taped my old SIM to the card that came with the new sim like they do in every country when you do this. I had to ask for a sim removal tool (usually it comes with the new sim pack) and the lady dug up a paper clip (This was my first clue something was wrong) and taped that to the card as well.

 I check majority of Fahasa bookstores when I pass them and the occasional stationery shop but I can&#x27;t seem to find this specific brand. Not available on Shopee, Lazada, etc. either ):
 I would love for any specific shop names if you know any, and any other suggestions as well! Ordering and shipping directly from the website is kinda my last resort.
 Thank you in advance! ((:

                              <span>So me and my partner were walking in some park in HCMC and a guy appeared from nowhere and started pointing at my partner’s shoe. We didn’t understand what he meant so he came closer and took out a funny brush from his “shoe repair and maintenance box” and started quickly washing my bf’s shoes. We both said “No” about five times and soon there was another guy attacking my shoes. They basically took of our shoes from our feet - pretended to wash them with their super duper chemicals and glued an extra heel on my bf’s Birkenstock sandals (which of course came off after a few days and looks hilarious). After finishing their grand hard work of one minute they asked us 500.000 dongs from each of us (~40 euros in total). It’s not that I didn’t expect for them to ask money, I understood it from the very beginning but they were really good and quick in undressing us.. I gave them 500.000 (shouldn’t have) and they asked for another half. I literally showed them my wallet - I didn’t have that much. It is funny that they didn’t agree to take less than 500.000 - they were insisting on their price and I started finally showing my attitude, saying that we didn’t want their “service” in the first place and that we don’t have more money. So I told them let’s call the police. They didn’t like the idea and their hooligan leader took my bf’s shoe and threw it in the trash bin direction. We quickly vanished afterwards. So, our stupidity is not under a question mark - it was our first day in Vietnam, we were probably jetlagged and awed, and just fools. However, we indeed said “no” many many times and actually the next level would’ve been shouting, which we didn’t even consider and our politeness costed us 500000 dongs. My question is about the police - which side would’ve they taken? I assume this shoe business is illegal and we would’ve been right? But I saw so many people in forms in the city (I assume - policemen) - how come is their business still running?

 Anh la nguoi Viet Kieu! I plan to work remotely in Sai Gon for about five weeks this mid-August and spend time with my significant other. I want to understand if any modest to upscale furnished apartments in Sai Gon cater to individuals like myself. Previously, I stayed at Cherry Hotel and Apartment in Tan Binh last month for vacation. At the bare minimum, I need high-speed and a reliable Internet connection since I work in I.T., specifically software programming. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m planning to travel to Vietnam (29/F) landing in Ho Chi Minh City. I&#x27;m well travelled in Europe but it will be my first time in Asia. I will join a tour for most of my stay but was planning on arriving in advance to get over jet lag and relax a bit. Do you have any tips for my safety and to avoid scams? Where should I stay and what transport is best from the airport? I read about some taxi scams? I&#x27;d be happy to splurge a bit to be in a nice hotel with a swimming pool where I could meet other travellers perhaps and explore the area in advance of the tour (50-75 euro per night). Also, should I have predominantly cash in the local currency? Any generic advice would be appreciated as I&#x27;m getting nervous!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I’m going to Sapa in a few days time and I’m wondering if grab or uber operates in Sapa? I’ve been reading online that taxis there turn off their meters and charge unreasonable prices. If not, is there any easier way to travel around? I can’t rent a moto or a car to go around yet.

                              <span>For context, my partner and I live together with his parents, but we are not married. We also live in a European country. My partner has lived here since birth and his parents came here i think shortly after the war. They are both from northern Vietnam. I have only lived here for 4 years. I refer to them as bố and mẹ since I&#x27;m learning Vietnamese, and bố told me that since my partner and I are living together, it is the same as being married in Vietnam, and that it&#x27;s fine for me to call them bố and mẹ since its normal to call your in-laws mom and dad, and this is also common in the culture that I grew up in. The issue/thing that is confusing me is that while neither have an issue with me calling them that, bố always responds for himself as bố , while mẹ switches between mẹ and cô. I only use simple vietnamese at the moment, but an example would be:I: khi nào bố sẽ đi làm ? B: bố đi làm lúc (time)
 Mẹ would use the same or respond with cô. Is this a regional or cultural thing, or is this because there is no blood relation? I don&#x27;t think I have heard her use it with my partner or her daughter, but it oculd be that I missed it because I&#x27;m still learning the language. I also thought that it might be similar to how bạn, tôi is used as another exception pronoun. Do other non-vietnamese people also refer to their vietnamese in-laws in the same way?

                              <span>I would like to learn more about Vietnam’s politics. The way that the locals see it.
 However, I cannot just look it up online because what is posted about how the government works is not how it goes in real life. 
 For example this was on the official government site: The Constitution clearly indicates that the state power is in the hand of the people. The State is of the people, by the people and for the people.

They were fairly large prints that were on some type of material that I hadn’t seen before. Not your typical art canvas or cloth. Had kind of rubbery texture to it. I ended up making digital copies of them. 
 There are signatures on each them that I can’t make out. Does anyone have an idea of what region of VN could’ve been the inspiration for these pieces? They’re beautiful and I want to know more about them.

 My husbands and I will be travelling with our 3 year old and worried it might be unbearable for her since she’s never been to a country that hot before. Any advice of these 3 cities will be much appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am a person who lives in the USA. I visited Vietnam over the new year holiday and absolutely fell in love with the country. I visited my wife’s family in HCMC and now I have dreams of coming to live there too. I, of course, would try to find our own place to live as I would never want to burden my wife’s family.
 However, when telling my wife’s family that I want to move there they continuously tell us never to move there. When asked if they would ever move to the USA they always say no because it is boring, dangerous, and they love the life they have in Vietnam. I don’t understand why someone would tell me not to live somewhere if they would not leave that place at the first opportunity. They live a great life in Vietnam and my wife’s brother is always taking trips to other nearby countries and buying expensive things as a flight attendant. 
 I make a lot more money here in the USA, but with the rising cost of living and potential economic recession, I wish for a life that is much simpler. Am I wrong for wanting that? Am I wrong for thinking they might be hypocrites? Am I wrong for thinking I could have a much more comfortable life there? Please let me know.

                              <span>is this really a thing? from what people have told me. if your family fought for the south. the government can look up your records. if your family had anything to do with the south. they would punish your family for about 5 generations. for example, less opportunities among other things. Let&#x27;s say my grandparents fought for the south. I have less opportunities than people who fought for the north. it would be harder for me to get into universities regardless of my test scores. i will never get into politics or work for the government.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently on a sleeper train and my cabin is infested with cockroaches. I&#x27;m keeping my light on so I can kill the roaches. I&#x27;ve probably killed 30 so far but they keep on coming. Do you think my light is attracting them? I don&#x27;t want to turn the light off because they&#x27;re freaking me out. I don&#x27;t think I will be able to relax.

                              <span>Hi everyone, just spend my second day in HCMC and noticed many places we’ve been to don’t have prices on menus. When the bill comes it’s often strangely expensive. Don’t feel like I’ve been to overly touristy places but it seems odd to me, don’t imagine locals pay these prices? Granted it is my fault stopping in places with no prices advertised. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;m near done mapping out a trip to Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. I have a hostel for Ho Chi Minh but plan to just find places to stay as I go and stop. I’m getting a motorbike so these places that are for 1 day are just stop overs with maybe ¾ of the day for exploring, hence the odd day calculations…just want to be realistic.
 In total the trip is 29 days long but ultimately wondering what people’s opinions are at the times in these locations? Am I spending too much/too little time in places or prioritizing the wrong places? The only thing set in stone is Ha Long Bay, I’ll need to be there by the 26th day. My hostel in HCMC is also booked but was $12/night so is a wash if things change.
 The trip is pretty linear so things to an extent can be cut and put other places. Would love folks opinions cause most things I read say everywhere is amazing and I don’t have all the time haha!
 (3.75 days) Days 1 to 5 Ho Chi Minh City
 *I originally had 3 days is this too much time at 4 days? Worried Jet lag will put me out of commission for the day, but I arrive around noon my first day
 (1.75 days) Day 5 to 7 Phan Thiet/Mui Ne
 *Should I take a day here and give it to Dalat? Should I skip?
 (.75 days) Day 7 to 8 Dalat
 (1.75 days) Day 8 to 10 Nha Trong
 (.75 days) Days 10 to 11 Quy Nhon
 *Could go straight to Pleiku but have heard good things about Quy Nhon?
 (.75 days) Days 11 to 12 Pleiku
 (2.75 days) Days 12 to 15 Hoi An/Da Nang
 (1.75 days) Days 15 to 17 Hue
 (1.75 days) Days 17 to 19 Phong Nha
 *Wanted to do only 1 day but think if I wanna see the caves will need a whole extra day
 (.75 days) Days 19 to 20 Vinh or Thai Hoa
 *OR I am going to skip and take a bus from Dong Hoi to Ninh Binh saving a day
 (1.75 days) Days 20 to 22 Ninh Binh
 (3.75 days) Days 22 to 26 Hanoi
 (2.75 days) Days 26 to 28 Ha Long Bay *Already booked
 (1 day) Day 28-29 Stay Near Airport in Hanoi and Go Home

                              <span>So I was studying in an VUS English center. While in conversation with another classmate. He is joking me like hanging his hand like he’s pretend to grab a string. I dunno what he was doing and he slapped me hard (my head hurts afterwards). So guys, what do you guys think about this situation?

                              <span>Good evening everyone. Hoping this topic is ok to discuss here. I just found out that Vietnam has one of the most liberal laws on abortion. Would just like to ask if abortion procedure is available for tourist. I’m suspecting that I am currently pregnant (around week 2) and can’t afford to have this at the moment due to multiple personal problems. Thank you and sorry if i offend anyone here regarding this topic.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I want to make a music playlist or compilation for my parents of music they might have listened to in their youth. It&#x27;s both for them just for fun but also in case one of them develops dementia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. If you didn&#x27;t know, playing music from someone&#x27;s formative years can help them have clear and lucid moments if they have a cognitive degenerative disease. 
 Does anyone have specific artist suggestions and where to find them? I am in the US so I usually use Youtube or Spotify to search for music and I&#x27;m not aware of what services in VN would have music from that era. Anyway, when I have searched on google, I see a lot of articles about early rock and roll in Sai Gon. I don&#x27;t think my parents would have listened to that or gone to any of those clubs since they are from Central and rarely traveled to Sai Gon. 
 I believe it would be very meaningful to my parents so thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ll be going to Vietnam this summer and will be traveling with sleeper busses to safe time and money. I am 195cm (6&#x27;5&quot;) and my concern is that this will be extremely uncomfortable. Any recommendations?

                              <span>are 3d graphics specialists and graphic designers in demand here? 
 I am a 3d generalist, mid, and thinking about moving to Vietnam and while I can continue working as a freelancer, having a local job would be very interesting and more comfortable in terms of visa. 
 I am capable of making character animations, garments, modeling and textures, can set up the environment and do common designer tasks from time to time (building a website (frontend), logo, banners).

                              <span>😥I lost 500k vnd at the gift shop. 
 I bought a total of 11 key chains and 3 magnets for 270k at the gift shop for family and friends. 
 It&#x27;s a cash only place and while counting my money, 2x100k, 2x10k and 1x500k instead of 50k, while I was checking my money but the old lady at the shop snatched the money. I just got back to the hotel after 4 hours of walking and exploring. 
 Any Vietnamese folks here think it&#x27;s even remotely possible to retrieve or forget and enjoy the rest of the trip here?
 TL;DR - Lost 500k vnd instead of 50k note because cashier lady rushed and snatched it before we could double check.

                              <span>Hey guys! 
 I am a Vietnamese international student studying Accounting (kế toán) in the United States and I was wondering what the job market is like for accountants in Vietnam? 
 Ive basically grown up here in the US, and I do not know if my accounting degree will benefit me in Vietnam. My main questions are: 
  
How is the job market for accountants? Are accountants in demand with the rapid economic growth Vietnam is having? 
 
What is the avg salary for accountants in Vietnam? 
 
Will a US degree of Accounting benefit my career in Vietnam, as I know Vietnam has different accounting procedures compared to Western procedures?

                              <span>My wife and I are headed to Hanoi (1st time since Covid) and we&#x27;re super stoked to check out the local spots to eat, both new and old. We&#x27;d love to hear your top suggestions as we always find good info from this community.
 The kind of food we like are from both local $ and mid-tier $$ (we&#x27;re not fancy people). Here is our favorite place in Saigon - if anyone knows a spot like this in Hanoi....please send the suggestion!

                              <span>Could someone please describe the VUS curriculum for learning English as an adult to me? Or point me to somewhere that describes it in English?
 Specifically, I heard there is a level / lesson 1 that costs ~$1,000 USD / ~24 million VND. I&#x27;m wondering how proficient one would be at English at the end of that? Also, I&#x27;m wondering how long it takes for someone to get through that course on average?
 Bonus question: how many levels are there in total for learning English? What is taught in those levels and how long does it take an average adult to complete them?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a job over there for a while but most are teaching jobs. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of English only jobs from PWC and Apple in HCMC but when I apply on JobStreet they don&#x27;t reply. Are there any recruitment firms I can hire to help me out?

                              <span>Hi, one of friends loooves Vietnam, and has been learning the language for the past 6 years. He is now fluent in the spoken and written language (although he’s read a bunch of classic literature so some people tell him he speaks like he’s from the 1920s hahaha). He’s traveled in Vietnam for probably 1.5 years total. 
 The other night I was showing him this old book I found about social etiquette in the US in the early 1900s. It had very specific things like “how to write a letter of apology” or “how to help someone out of a carriage.“ As we were reading, he said, “I wish I could find a book like this about the nuances of Vietnamese culture!”
 I’ve looked around the internet, but because I cant speak Vietnamese, most of the books I find are travel books for people that don’t know anything about the country. I’d love suggestions about books written in Vietnamese about the “unspoken“ rules and nuances of Vietnamese culture.

I don&#x27;t have my prescription anymore, but I really do need to take care of my anxiety and OCD. Can I bring them to Vietnam without prescription? Would it get me in trouble and if so to what extent?

                              <span>Hi, I will be coming to Vietnam at the end of May. I was planning to do an overnight cruise in Ha Long Bay during my trip, however some of the threads have me a bit concerned. 
 A lot of posts in different forums have mentioned about the bay being extremely dirty with floating garbage in most places and smelling of diesel everywhere. Since a lot of these posts are from different years I want to know from someone who has been there recently if that is still the case? If so how badly does it affect the experience? I&#x27;m mostly interested in the views and maybe kayaking so please tell according to that. I also read some suggesting to opt for day cruise instead but I have my heart set on spending at least one night under the stars with scenic view on the cruise, are my expectations too much?
 Is it worth spending extra for better quality cruises? I don&#x27;t plan on splurging what the best 5 star cruises cost, so will probably look for a relatively cheap 5 star or a 4 star cruise. Are they considerably better than the budget/3 star cruises or if I&#x27;m not going for the top tier it makes no difference?
 Is Lan Ha Bay a better option? As long as the views are good I won&#x27;t mind a switch. If the views are not that good but the crowd is considerably less then I will even prefer it. I can compromise on activities a bit as well.
 Please let me know your thoughts.

 Maybe my google-fu is off today, but I&#x27;m struggling to find what I need. We&#x27;re just tourists who&#x27;ve been here a week and are here for a week and a half longer, so somewhere we can just walk in and take a test would be great, even if it means paying a bit more.
 So where can I get a full parasite test in Hanoi?

                              <span>Hey everybody,
 I’m a landscape architecture student at the university of life sciences in Warsaw. Currently me and a group of other students are starting work on a project of a small garden that belongs to the Museum of Asia and the Pacific. There are elements already present there that were built and funded by the Vietnamese community of Warsaw (the biggest being a mini version of the pagoda on one leg from Hanoi) that we will be designing around. I would like to ask you - what is one significant aspect/element of your culture that you would like to have represented in such a garden?

                              <span>I’m going on vacation to Saigon for a few weeks and staying at the Continental hotel in Saigon. Their gym there is lacking in a lot of equipment for lifting, so I’m wondering if anyone knows of any gyms nearby the hotel that offer day passes or something.

Do they know they are literally gassing people? Contributing even more than other people to the pollution and health problems caused by these exhaust gasses..

I&#x27;ve had an itchy mouth whenever I eat peanuts so I went for a test at a clinic, it came back that I&#x27;m allergic to peanuts (only low on the scale but I know it can get worse with exposure). They didn&#x27;t prescribe me an epipen but I want one for peace of mind. 
 Is this possible here? Do I need a prescription or can I go to a pharmacy and buy one? Do they even exist here?

 I&#x27;m looking for a place in Phu Quoc similar to Bui Vien (backpacker street) in Ho Chi Minh City.
 Is there a good street or place to drink with lots of bars and pubs?
 If someone have any information on this, please let me know! Thanks!

                              <span>The French believed that they could overwhelm the Vietnamese by air, as they had no anti aircraft capability. However the Viet Minh managed to move their artillery over the hills, dug tunnels in mountains, and effectively countered the French battery fire.
 Marked by heavy trench to trench combat, much like in WW1, howevet the Viet Minh&#x27;s anti aircraft artillery, ensured the French aircraft could not resupply the besieged garrison, and after 2 months it finally fell.

                              <span>I’ll go first:
  
How easy it is to organise service: getting wifi set up, a couch delivered, Grab food. Everything is so quick!
 
In my opinion, people are kinder in Vietnam. There’s something about the way people interact and occupy space which seems more collegial. 
 
The cost of living is so much less oppressive. I know it’s a privilege to be able to say that. 
 
 I’ve been here since 2015, living and working full-time. So, before anyone asks if I’m in expat honeymoon phase…nope.

                              <span>Last year, I visited Vietnam and got this great face wash in the store when I forgot to bring my own. I didn&#x27;t get to buy more before leaving, and now I want to buy a good amount and ship it to the U.S. However, all of the websites that I found selling the same face wash only ship within Vietnam. Does anyone know any way I can get it shipped to the U.S.? Alternatively, is there a similar face wash I can get in the U.S.? A lot of the U.S. brands are really bad for my skin.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure where to start with the type of phim but anything that has an interesting plot would be cool.
 And prefer that the phim is recent around 2017-2023..
 Thank you

                              <span>I was reading an article about the oscar winning actor Ke huy quan, who was part of an ethnic chinese minority community in vietnam. He lived in a mainly chinese area of saigon and fled the country with his family after the south lost. The article mentions that “most” of the people who left south vietnam in the 70s were of chinese origin as well. This was surprising to me as i always thought it was mainly people of viet descent and maybe only a few chinese (I only know what i was told since im 2nd gen and was born way after my grandparents left). But do you think this was likely true about boat people being mostly chinese? If so why would mainly chinese people have been the ones to leave vietnam after the end of the war?

                              <span>So as the subject says… I’m an oxycodone addict - and could use some advice… 
 I am tremendously embarrassed that I’ve gotten myself into this position, but long story short - I recently sold a business to a large multi-national corporation who has an office in Ho Chi Minh. I’ll be traveling to the office next week - but am concerned about the risks associated with traveling through customs with oxycodone pills… without them I’d be going through intense withdrawals, so I have to either do the trip and bring pills with me, or find an excuse to cancel the trip outright - which would have some pretty damaging outcomes (and could literally reduce my remaining earn-out from the acquisition by millions of dollars usd).
 I’m not looking for comments on getting clean or other judgements at this phase - I have my own plans for how I’m going to achieve that once the financial aspect of the sale and related earn-outs are completed…. But I do want to better understand the risks id be taking if I travel to VN and going through customs with oxy pills.
 Can someone help clarify what the laws are? Especially for USA foreigners traveling for work?
 To be clear - I don’t have a script and when I travel in the USA I just put them in a pill bottle for an old unrelated medication. Considering doing the same here - but haven’t travelled to VN before and I’m seeing conflicting details on the web about our drug laws and related punishments.
 Thanks for your help and non judgement!

I recently talked about it with my girlfriend and we both wondered of there is a story or believe behind it. Does anyone know more about it? We are not living in Vietnam so I am not sure if it is a regional thing or known in whole Vietnam.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know why, as Vietnam&#x27;s literary influence during the early 20th century were only influenced mostly by a mixture of Sinosphere culture and French literary works.
 Hàn Mặc Tử is also a man who really likes making poems in the new style (he will never be someone like Xuân Diệu who is just a man that adopted the French&#x27;s poems and turned it into his own style). His early works before he got lyprosy were very similar to Xuân Diệu, the newest poets of the movement. After that though, his poems suddenly changes style to reflect on the suffering he had to endure, while maintaining his love for life around.
 It&#x27;s weird, but the way he used words that are just plain visceral, and sometimes is borderline insane (his style was the crazy one during the movement). There&#x27;s a certain level of sur…</span>

 Some of you guys may know about Pro Wrestling - an art with combination of stage techniques and wrestling together to entertain people. Or you will familiarize with the name WWE, home of many famous athletes like John Cena, Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, Dave Bautista,..etc. At Saigon there was a group of many young and talented guys with the love for pro wrestling call Vietnam Pro Wrestling (VPW for short). They have trained and organized many shows to Vietnam fans. Starting from a small dance studio with 30-50 people, wrestling on mat to nowaday performing on real wrestling ring, with attendance around 200-300 people per show.
 This June 3rd, they will organized their biggest event in the year called Ultimate Collision. Beside our Vietnamese wrestlers, we will have attendance from other wrestlers in Southeast Asia. So if you guy want to experience a burning hot and energetic Saturday night, maybe take your free time to attend their incoming show. More details on Vietnam Pro Wrestling facebook page.

 Vietnam has a marriage divorce rate at around 0.2 per 1000 people or around 5-10% of all vietnamese people will get divorced. Compared to the US were almost 50% of married people will get a divorce. That is about a 10x of the rate in US. Anyone has some light to shed on the reason why this is the case? Comment from article. 
  
Lowest Divorce Rate in the World Vietnam possesses the lowest divorce rate in the world, at 0.2 per 1,000 people. This is an impressive feat for a country with a population of over 97 million, as it indicates that couples in the region are more likely to stay together than those living elsewhere in the world. In addition to this, Vietnam has one of the highest marriage rates overall. The culture puts considerable emphasis on family and loyalty within relationships, which helps explain why divorce rates are so low. Furthermore, marriage is seen as a means of protection from poverty or any other form of financial instability as couples share costs and resources. Finally, societal norms and expectations play a major role; especially amongst older generations who frown upon divorce and may even threaten older married couples with social exclusion if they decide to end their marriages. All these factors combine to result in very low divorce rates in Vietnam compared to other countries around the world.

                              <span>I started watching some Vietnamese movies in order to practice Vietnamese and started to wonder about the type of content that can be seen in Vietnam.
 Does Vietnam allow certain amounts of gore, blood, or violence to be shown in TV shows or movies or is it really limited in what can be seen? Is nudity allowed in media or is it partially censored like in countries like Japan? Is porn illegal in the country or is it allowed?
 Sorry for the questions but I was just curious to know what directors and writers are dealing with when creating shows or films in the country.

                              <span>I have browsed on many Vietnamese forums, subreddits and even Youtube videos. Once or twice, I would see a Vietnamese netizen drop this word Tây Lông.
 Apparently this is a word used to ridicule Westerners in general, as it translates literally to “hairy Westerners”. I have seen very negative attitudes towards Westerners in communities such as r/trotruyenlinhtinh, where they seem to have a negative bias against Westerners.
 Personally I would never stoop down that low and use that word, regardless of the social situations, like even if a Western tourist was rude. But how is the word perceived by Vietnamese people? Should this word be considered rude and offensive?
 EDIT: Apologise, the subreddit name is r/trochuyenlinhtinh, instead of r/trotruyenlinhtinh, rookie mistake on my Vietnamese spelling part lol

                              <span>I think most people know that Vietnamese has influence from French due to Frances&#x27; history of colonization in Vietnam. But it was portguese missionaries who where the first Europeans that came to vietnam and latinize the classically written classical script of Vietnamese.
 So my question is, does anyone know more history about how the portuguese language influenced Vietnamese? I was learning brazilian portuguese independently and noticed some similarities with Vietnamese. For example the use of the ~ tilde accent mark, and the &quot;nh&quot; constant cluster sounding like &quot;y&quot;. I was able to find this article and a few comments on the Vietnamese alphabet Wikipedia.

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 Recently I am considering studying Data Analytics for a possible Data Analyst/Business Analyst job (heard they&#x27;re often strongly related), so I wanted to ask some questions about the market here in Vietnam or East Asia with a specific focus on foreigners, since I am one.
 Hope there is someone in this group currently doing these types of job here in Vietnam or in East Asia that can provide some insights.
 I have a Bachelor degree in Chinese studies, so not related, just recently completed an internship in my country&#x27;s chamber of commerce here in Vietnam.
 I would start from scratch and self-study online (I know it&#x27;s not easy but I did it before and got some certifications on Coursera, Udemy etc...).
 Questions:
 1) Is there a fundamental language barrier when it comes to the data in relationship to the country you are working in? More specifically, will the data be in the local language? / Do you need to have proficiency in the local language in order to find a job in the field?
 2) Is it sensible for a foreigner to search for those types of job or will a local professional always be preferred?
 3) Briefly, how would you describe your experience in this field here in Vietnam or East Asia as a foreigner? Positives, negatives, up, downs?
 4) Finally, do you have any tips or recommendations?
 Thought this may be useful for any foreigner wondering about their career in Asia.

 I haven’t been to Vietnam in a long time and want to make sure I’m being respectful and don’t make them uncomfortable with my restaurant choices. Thank you

Vòng quay vẫn xoay ngoài một người tìm đâu thấy đây , dừng ngay phút giây thật nhẹ nhàng nắm đôi bàn tay , em ơi xin đừng hững hờ, em ơi xin hãy mơ, mơ đôi ta cùng mong chờ nơi hai ta cùng nhớ , tay trong tay tình yêu đầy như cơn mưa hừng đông , xua tan mây mờ nơi này em có nghe được không ( nhạc )......... .

Hoa bay qua thắm đôi môi mềm , nhẹ nhàng anh năng niêu tia nắng rơi bên thềm , nghe em ngâng khúc ca êm đềm , chiều nhẹ nhàng ru anh trong giấc mơ bên em . Tình yêu giấc mơ thật ngọt ngào mang bao ý thơ , lòng ai ngẳng ngơ hòa vào chiều nhìn mây lững lờ , vòng quay vẫn xoay ngoài một người tìm đâu thấy đây , dừng ngay phút giây thật nhẹ nhàng nắm đôi bàn tay , em ơi xin đừng hững hờ em ơi xin hãy mơ , mơ đôi ta cùng mong chờ nơi hai ta cùng nhớ , tay trong tay tình yêu đầy như cơn mưa hừng đông , xua tan mây mờ nơi này em có nghe được không .

What are the requirements to apply for the jobs? Hows the work life balance? How much money is made in the job? I want to move to Vietnam if I can get a job flying there, and want to be prepared to apply for jobs as soon as I am done training.

 I am planning on taking her to get a manicure, go to a nice cafe for some coffee, maybe go out to Bui Vien street tonight (hopefully not too unsafe). 
 I&#x27;m thinking of whether there are any game cafes or anything else that&#x27;s activity based we could do today. Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>My friend and I need revision surgeries for a breast augmentation. We are both American and no longer trust the implants here in America. Is this a safe place to go for plastic surgery? Any red flags?

                              <span>I live in a city is Massachusetts (USA) that has a large population of Vietnamese immigrants but I only ever see the South Vietnamese flag. Never the actual flag of Vietnam. Does Vietnam have a portion of its people that are still bitter of the unification or is it just something that is an American thing? I assume there is but Im not sure. Not sure if I phrased this question properly.

                              <span>I know reddit is not the best place for to ask for advice on life changing decisions, but I&#x27;m struggling to make a decision. I&#x27;ve booked a flight to Vietnam, which is less than 1 month away, but I&#x27;m on the verge of canceling the whole thing. 
 To give a bit of background, I&#x27;ve lived in the UK for almost half of my life. I left Vietnam during my high school years and have been working/studying here ever since. I have a good job, earning well above average wage and I&#x27;m happy with all aspects of my life here. 
 I go back to Vietnam once in a while and was surprised by how much things have changed. There definitely are a lot of opportunities there, especially when it comes to having your own start up firm, and potentially earn way more than if I continue as a salary worker in the UK after taking into account of the cost of living. That and the fact that my parents are getting old and I want to spend time with them, made me want to go back. 
 However, within the last 2 months, as I&#x27;ve been saying goodbye to everything and everyone I know here, I just feel a sense of sadness that I&#x27;m leaving my comfortable life and good career behind for something that might not work out. I feel like I might be making a big mistake. To make it worse, I&#x27;m almost certain now that my relationships with my parents are beyond repair, and we won&#x27;t get along no matter what. 
 My flight is just a few weeks away and I feel very much like just not going to the airport, and just telling my boss that I&#x27;m not leaving anymore and going back to the way it was before.
 I&#x27;m just posting it on here in the slim chance that someone might have been in the same boat and have some advice to offer.

 Something uniquely Hanoi or uniquely Vietnam. Plus points if its a conversation piece. Thanks everyone!

                              <span>I did the loop tour with Cheers hostel. On the 2nd night we stay in a small village near a waterfall in Du Gia. There were two small, cute dogs living at the homestay. I went out to smoke and one dog was chasing after me and gnawing on my leg in a playful manner, however I think he may have broke through the skin.
 I had 3 doses of rabies vaccine before travel. Should I go get 2 more?

                              <span>I will be going to NYC and Philly in August to meet my relatives. I wonder if it&#x27;s okay when I go to Vietnamese places like Little Saigon and speak with my &quot;Hanoi&quot; accent normally there. I never been to the States before, tho, and I heard a few guys got threatened or discriminated by speaking those accent. Idk if they were just joking or sum tho.
 Moreover, how should I behave there? should I just be normal like in Vietnam or is there something I need to worry about? I&#x27;m sorry if my question triggered some of you guys. I know the history and have no hate towards &#x27;boat people&#x27; at all. It&#x27;s just i never been to The States so I really need this kind of information.
 Btw, thanks for helping me my fellow redditors, hope y&#x27;all have productive day 😁

                              <span>In the bustling city of Da Nang, there was a humble street food vendor named Thực who sold banh bao from his xe ba gác. Despite his modest means, Thực had a deep reverence for the role of food in Vietnamese culture and a compassionate heart that drove him to help those in need.
 One day, as he was preparing his banh bao for the day, he was visited by a strange, otherworldly presence. The entity introduced itself as Ong Tao, the kitchen god, and explained that it had been watching Thực&#x27;s selfless work and recognized his desire to help others through the power of food.
 In recognition of Thực&#x27;s compassion and dedication, Ong Tao bestowed upon him a great gift: the ability to be in multiple places at once, and a cart with a bottomless supply of banh bao. With this power, Thực could feed anyon…</span>

                              <span>Một ngày nóng nực như mọi ngày, cuộc sống vẫn cứ tiếp diễn y hệt vậy. Từ sau lần cuối xảy ra sự kiện đó, chúng ta đã quá quen thuộc với cái nóng và đã dần thích nghi với nó. Đã gần 300 năm kể từ khi những con quái vật từ trong mặt trời xuất hiện. Chúng ta đã chiến đấu và kết quả nhận được là sự diệt vong trên diện rộng do bão mặt trời từ những con quái vật gây ra. Trong một khu bảo an cuối cùng của nhân loại. Cương vội rít nhẹ điếu thuốc lá có thể xem là còn sót lại cuối cùng trên vũ trụ này. Vốn dĩ anh không hề thích thuốc lá, nhưng từ sau khi chứng kiến Dương, người bạn thân giàu sinh ra tử cùng mình lại biến mất một cách bí ẩn thì anh ta cũng đã thay đổi thói quen và tính cách. Ngày hôm nay cũng như mọi ngày Cương vẫn vậy. Tay cầm khẩu súng và leo lên trạm quan sát. Từ góc nhìn này anh có thể nhìn thấy toàn cảnh khu bảo an. Những đứa nhóc chạy chơi xung quanh những bãi cỏ bị cháy và những người lớn đang canh tác trên những cánh đồng khô héo, xa hơn có thể thấy những thành phố mà anh chỉ được nghe kể về thời kỳ mà con người vẫn còn làm chủ hành tinh này từ những người lớn tuổi. Bất giác anh như vô thức lau đi những giọt mồ hôi chen lẫn nước mắt khi nghĩ về nó. Rồi anh lại hướng mắt xa hơn về phía đó. Bất chợt anh thấy từ xa có vẻ có người đang đi về phía trại bảo an. Ngay lập tức anh ra hiệu cảnh báo để toàn trại vào trạng thái chiến đấu. Các hệ thống cảnh báo vang lên gầm rú như tiếng súng nổ. Các ụ súng và hệ thống tên lửa được kích hoạt, các chiến binh đều đã vào hệ thống công sự để phòng thủ. Bất ngờ Cương vội ra hiệu tắt hệ thống cảnh báo và phòng thủ vì hình như anh nhận ra điều gì đó... Hết tập 1... Mình mới tập viết truyện để giải sầu vì cuộc sống thực nó quá tiêu cực với mình. Ae xem nếu không thích thì cmt để mình gỡ nha, cảm ơn các bạn ! Vô Danh !!!

 I’m a 21m student and I took a job as a waiter at a Vietnamese restaurant. I was born in Germany, but both my parents are Vietnamese and my Vietnamese is enough to hold a conversation and, after having worked one year at the restaurant, I communicate with my colleagues in Vietnamese during work without any problems. 
 I shortly shelved products at a supermarket before working as a waiter, so I don’t have much experience, but wanted to earn some money on the side. 
 I’m quite committed to my job, maybe a little foolishly so. If I get called short-notice, I come to work. I can get a bad conscience when thinking about customers not getting decent service or my colleagues getting under too much pressure. I have dr…</span>

 I immigrated to the US as a teen through HO, now I wish to apply for Song Tich.
 I called the US embassy website in DC but I wasn&#x27;t able to get through. I was wondering which of the following option is the correct one to go by?
 Is it Instruction for registration to retain Vietnamese Citizenship?

                              <span>Have you guys heard any stories from your parents about period 1975 - 1986 in Vietnam?
 The period of the “Subsidy Economy” (Bao cap) (1975-1986) has been known as a time of hardships, when mechanism for socio-economic management was inappropriate, causing privations in people’s material and spiritual life. Material life was poor due to a sluggish and inefficient production system, but the constraints also applied to people’s creative and spiritual endeavors.
 “Bao cap” was a period during which both the courage and intelligence of millions of people were suppressed and were anxious about liberation. It was a dramatic period, and a profound lesson about the law of social development.
 During this period, food, goods, and services were purchased with coupons or food stamps. Those with a position in government received more coupons and had access to special shops. For those without special status, they could expect to spend almost a day waiting in line to buy rice and other basic commodities. Everything was controlled by the government. Having a bicycle – even one that was ancient and on the verge of breakdown – was considered a luxury. If you were fortunate enough to own one, you&#x27;d be on a special list of bicycle owners allowed to buy parts (such as inner tubes, nuts, bolts, etc.).
 My parents met each other in an illiteracy eradication class. They also told me that when they finished secondary, people ran through backgrounds check (which side you supported during the war) and eventually my parents couldn’t go to high school. Can you guys share your family’s stories regarding this period?

                              <span>We rented motorbikes from Tigit Motorbikes to ride from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. The bikes were awesome. The staff provided us with excellent route options and prepared us for our long journey. The staff was very knowledgeable and the routes were incredible. The bikes were expertly maintained and had great rubber for our long journey. I would recommend using tigit for any length of bike rental, whether it&#x27;s for a day or a month. Be sure to go through their website if your having any questions regarding driving permits or route options. Thanks Tigit! https://www.tigitmotorbikes.com/

                              <span>Hello, me and my partner are planning two weeks in Vietnam in either September or early October. We&#x27;re coming from the UK and want to make the best use of our time. My current thinking is to stay in the North to avoid the bad weather in the centeral region. Would like to visit Hanoi, Ha Long, Sapa and maybe Ninh Binh or one other place. 
 Few questions: - I would love to visit Hue and Hoi An but are we right to avoid these in October? - Most two week sample itineraries cover the whole country , but is there enough to do in the North for two weeks? - Are there any other cities worth visiting in the North? - Would it be worth adding a destination outside of North Vietnam somewhere where the weather is ok e.g. South Vietnam, Cambodia etc?
 Thanks! ☺️

                              <span>Hey guys. I’m doing a motorbike trip south west of Hanoi which has been a real adventure and very eventful. The only problem I’ve had has been getting enough sleep😂. The Nha Nghi I was in on 30/4 was next to a Karaoke place which closed at 3am so no sleep till then (good for them it sounded like a great party.) I decided to find a Nha Nghi outside of town so it would be quiet and rural but a guy turns up outside at 5am and starts having a conversational chat with himself on a megaphone. Is this normal?

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting ready to go to Vietnam in about 2 months and had a pre-travel consultation at my health clinic (in the US). The doctor highly recommended the Japanese encephalitis vaccine but said it&#x27;s 2 shots at $350 each in the US but it would be much cheaper if I just get it when I arrive. I&#x27;m flying into Hanoi first, but can&#x27;t seem to find any clinics in Hanoi that offer it. It looks like it&#x27;s pretty easy to get it in Bangkok....but before I switch up my plans and buy a ticket from Hanoi to Bangkok just for a shot, I figured it&#x27;d be wise to check on here and see if anyone can recommend a clinic in Hanoi that offers this vaccine. Thanks so much!

This course I&#x27;m studying called &#x27;Leadership&#x27; requires a leader who will provide me with specific feedback on my draft plan (i.e., Leadership development plan). If you&#x27;re a leader of a project/company, can you please help me out? I&#x27;d love to have your support.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard that recently some vietnamese people trying to travel or work abroad were stopped at the airport on departure for not having an exit clearance from the government. There exists similar rules for Filipinos working abroad when leaving the Philippines, a kind of archaic form of government control/corruption. Does any one have news or information on these new rules in Vietnam? Seems this is a sudden and recent change affecting many who are cought by surprise at the airport.

                              <span>It’s a very fun fact that I’ve heard from a Vietnamese person. Children in a past often said “hitler!” as a slang which means to end a friendship, this term mostly used as a joke despite many didn’t even know who Hitler was before. So do y’all know where did this come from, out of nowhere? Like a fact that people in countryside Vietnam usually names their dog after US presidents or officials involved in Vietnam War.

                              <span>I am German girl in my early 20s. I met this good-looking Vietnamese guy at university. He is international student from Hanoi. He speaks German well, so there is no language barrier between us. We hang out and really hit it off. We are at the same age, so we have many things in common. I showed signs of interest many times but he hasn’t asked me to be his girlfriend. I think I am quite pretty blonde, so he may find me attractive. Are Vietnamese guys shy to show their interest? Or they only want serious relationship with Vietnamese girls. Should I ask him if he wants to be my boyfriend? 
 Edit: we even had sex, but he keeps making me uncertain

                              <span>Bạn có biết không? 1/4 dân số trên thế giới đang gặp phải khủng hoảng nguồn nước. 
 Từ Ấn Độ qua Iran đến Botswana, có đến 17 quốc gia trên thế giới hiện đang chịu áp lực do thiếu nước rất cao. Những nước này đang sử dụng gần như tất cả lượng nước họ có, theo dữ liệu mới của Viện Tài nguyên Thế giới (World Resources Institute) công bố.
 Trong những năm gần đây, rất nhiều thành phố lớn cạn kiệt cả nguồn nước, như São Paulo ở Brazil; Chennai ở Ấn Độ và Cape Town ở Nam Phi. Năm 2018 vừa rồi đánh dấu một thứ gọi là Day Zero (nghĩa là ngày mà ngay cả những con đập cũng không còn một giọt nước). Ở Việt Nam chúng mình, bà con nông dân ở khu vực đồng bằng sông Cửu Long vừa phải chống chọi với hạn hán, vừa phải chịu đựng nước mặn xâm lấn vào sâu trong đất liền do biến đổi khí hậu gây nên.

                              <span>im a 2nd gen living in australia and i grew up being exposed to the memory of reunification day/black april in a very somber and sad way. my parents/grandparents would sometimes share some memories but they didn’t like to talk about it because i think it was still traumatizing. being born in the 2000s i never experienced it firsthand but it was always something that i was curious about and wanted to learn more about. what does april 30th mean to you? if you were a member of the diasporic vietnamese community how did/do you feel about this day? does it still hold strong emotions for you, whether or not you were there?

                              <span>Am travelling Vietnam this month- I&#x27;m a young South Asian woman (born and bred in Australia though) and I always feel like I get looked at but maybe I&#x27;m just overly self conscious about it so notice it more... But wondering if there are prejudices held. Sometimes I get compliments on my skin tone (I&#x27;m lighter skinned but even then I&#x27;m paranoid they&#x27;re secretly taking the piss out of my skin tone)... I feel anxious that the looks I get come from a place of racism/judgement, and sometimes feel like there&#x27;s a change in attitude when they hear me speak fluent English. Anyway- honesty is appreciated!

                              <span>I’m visiting hcmc for the first time and I’m just bewildered at seeing infants and toddlers on scooters. I may be a bit more concerned since I came here with my 2 yo. Has there every been like a car seat for scooters? In case anyone thinks going slower while mother holds on is any kind of protection like my wife told me. 8kg crashing at 25km/h exerts a mass force of almost 500kg. Don’t know many babies that would survive that kind of impact or know any moms who could hold onto 500kg. I understand there’s often no other way to travel in Vietnam but at least like a pod or something for the baby to TRY to escape a crash without death or permanent disfigurement.

                              <span>From the west we obviously have a reputation for drinking too much hard liquor and far too frequently. 
 But I enjoy a beer about as often as Vietnamese do. 
 That is, on special occasions or social gatherings. 
 My problem is how much beer. I like 1-2 decent quality beers and some good relaxed conversation.
 But I find over here my cup just keeps getting refilled. 4,5,6,7 beers later and the case is empty. It&#x27;s just too much for my stomach or bladder to handle to be honest. I didn&#x27;t even drink like that when I was a delinquent teenager. 
 People start getting obnoxious and getting me to say rude and inappropriate things in Vietnamese (which I don&#x27;t speak very well). And they try to make me say it over and over and over again because they&#x27;re totally wasted. 
 I miss that culture of the west where you can take part in the drinking circle and everyone just drinks as much as they feel like. No pressure to gulp down 5L each. 
 I honestly like the taste of Tiger. It&#x27;s a pretty good beer for a mass-produced brew. 
 But I&#x27;ve had to completely give up social drinking while I&#x27;m here. My body just can&#x27;t handle that much anymore. I&#x27;m only 27 but I take antidepressants. 
 I don&#x27;t like to drink alone and my wife doesn&#x27;t like beer. 
 So that&#x27;s my story. This Canadian is done drinking beer. I like the taste, hate the drunk. 
 Not meant to be derogatory at all. This is just me expressing myself. I understand every culture is different and I&#x27;ve taken part in the drinking circle once with every new group I meet just to build that trust with them. But from then on I just refuse. It never just stops at 1-2 beers. 
 Also, ice in warm beer? Cold out of the fridge man. Cold out of the fridge. Completely ruins the taste for me.

                              <span>Hi, 
 Just want to ask all the Vietnamese born abroad a quick question: 
  
Are you learning Vietnamese at the moment and what is your current level?
 What are some types of content that you think are missing on the Internet/in textbooks that you really want to know about in terms of the Vietnamese language?
 If you can already speak Vietnamese to some extent, what kind of content/materials do you think would really help you become fluent?

                              <span>I speak English originally but I would like to learn this language and visit Vietnam one day. Duolingo and the books I got are helping me understand grammar and how to read the language bit by bit, but I SUCK at speaking it, and I know I do. And I don&#x27;t know any native speakers personally anymore to help correct my pronunciation. I think I end up overthinking and trying to implement the tones but in doing this I just mess the whole word up lol.
 I&#x27;ve tried saying phrases and words really slow then gradually increasing speed til at a normal speaking cadence and this helps a bit but I was wondering if there was something more efficient. Also I feel like due to my natural voice being kind of deep/bassy and the sort of hard way I tend to pronounce things the naturally softer or more nuanced sounds are kind of harsher than the audio samples I&#x27;m hearing. I&#x27;m just really having a hard time with this because my voice is deep and somewhat monotone unless I&#x27;m excited about something so it&#x27;s hard to do the tones and when I do I feel like I&#x27;m over emphasizing them.
 It&#x27;s bad enough I tend to even stutter a bit more than usual in English too but I completely butcher this beautiful language almost every time it comes out of my mouth. And I wanna be able to speak to native speakers but not laughably 💀 I know most people are gracious and kind enough to just appreciate you even took the time but still why do it if not correctly?

                              <span>Hello, I am planning to visit Vietnam soon for my vacation. I am also interested in exploring the possibility of adding 360-degree videos of public street locations to Google Street View that are currently not available on Google Maps. 
 As of now, I have noticed that only major roads have been filmed and added to Google Street View. However, I am curious about the feasibility of capturing more street locations and making them accessible on Google Maps. I understand that it is important to respect privacy and comply with any laws or regulations regarding photography in public spaces. 
 Therefore, I am seeking information on the legal implications of such a project in Vietnam. Specifically, I am interested in knowing if there are any restrictions on filming in public spaces and if capturing 360-degree videos of public street locations is allowed. I would also like to ensure that the project complies with local laws and respects the privacy of individuals. 
 Thank you for any guidance or information you can provide on this matter!

 We&#x27;ll be in Ninh Binh towards the end of our time and will have a couple of days we want to spend in the sun &amp; sand. Resort not necessary. The smaller - or homestay-like, the better.
 2 adults. November. Would appreciate your experience/advice.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m going to be moving to Hanoi soon and was looking for massage reccomendations. I am dealing with some injurys but have had great success with Active Release Technique (or ART). I was wondering if anyone can reccomend a massage type/parlor that does something similar to this. I know that I probably won&#x27;t be able to find an ART practicioner while in Hanoi so was wondering what the next best thing may be. For context ART basically involves hitting certain pressure points in soft tissue and manipulating the muscles around them through releases (i know just sounds a regular massage but it&#x27;s been much more effective than say Thai massages I&#x27;ve had in the past). If anyone has any ideas I&#x27;d really appreciate it, thanks!

                              <span>I decided to book a spontaneous trip to Hanoi and will land on September 15th. I&#x27;m super confused by all the conflicting information online about where to go/not to go due to the rainy season. 
 E.g. I&#x27;d love to do Ninh Bing (both Tam Coc and Trang An) but some websites say definitely don&#x27;t due to typhoons whilst others say it&#x27;ll be good cos it&#x27;s the low season. All i&#x27;ve got booked so far are 2 nights in Hanoi and have ~10 more days to plan. I&#x27;ll be flying out from HMC September 30. 
 Basically where should I definitely avoid?

                              <span>Australian here, I visit Vietnam every few years as I have family living in Saigon. Everytime I visit Vietnam, I always experience really bad food poisoning. My last visit to Vietnam was about 5 years ago, and that time was probably the worst food poisoning I&#x27;ve ever experienced, absolute bed ridden for about a week. 
 Any tips on how to avoid food poisoning and what to watch out for? I will be travelling to Vietnam again in a few months time and I&#x27;m definitely going to avoid eating raw food, as I&#x27;m pretty sure I got food poisoning from eating raw fish at a japanese restaurant in Phan Thiet. Many thanks!

                              <span>Hey friends,
 My girlfriend and I are traveling through Vietnam since a week now, and we are enjoying it so much. You have a beautiful country and I’ve seldomly experienced such a degree of hospitality! 
 We arrived late this night in Hanoi and are now looking for activities to fill the upcoming days. If I’ve understood correctly, today is reunification day and tomorrow is workers day? Would there be any parades or festivities in the city, one could attend? 
 Thank you so much in advance and feel free to share anything, you think we could enjoy here.

                              <span>I met a Vietnamese girl and we are both Christians. Same faith. However her parents are both in the idea of that she should settle down with a Vietnamese guy. She haven’t told her parents about us yet. Just wondering if this is common , and has anyone encountered this before and what was your experience ?
 To give some context: I’m half Indian and a Malaysian, she is south Vietnamese.

                              <span>I have a job offer in Thu Dau Mot. There is not a ton of information about this town online, at least in English. I am a little worried about there not being much to do or being able to meet other English speakers and making friends. I am curious if anyone here has any insight. What is life like in Thu Dau Mot? Is there much to do for a foreigner? The only other post asking about TDM is a few years old and I was told the area has seen a lot of growth. Has anything changed?
 About me: I am a male, in my 30&#x27;s, from the USA, and single. I speak no Vietnamese, although I enjoy learning languages and will attempt to learn basics while living in Vietnam. I don&#x27;t drink or care too much about having access to crazy nightlife, although I like the option of being able to go out occasionally with people. I enjoy nature, riding my motorcycle around, and doing outdoorsy stuff.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I met my gf online a few years back and ever since then I would see her every ~8 months or so. Unfortunately, I recently found out my mom has cancer and I cancelled all my travel plans since I need to take care of my mom. Last year she tried to get a visa to visit me in California but her visa got denied. What&#x27;s the best way for her to come visit since I am unable to go anywhere for the time being? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, first time in Saigon, wanna get some reccomendations for a hotel 1-1.5mil VND a night for 2 nights, probably around Ben Thành market?
 Would like to go the war remnants museum, maybe the Opera house 
 So many options its a bit confusing. 
 Having a pool would be a plus
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been feeling kinda worried for my mental health for a while now and wanted to get some diagnosis so I can see if there&#x27;s anything wrong with me. Does anyone know a good psychiatric in Hanoi for me to get a diagnosis?
 Also should I have it checked out since just in case there&#x27;s nothing really wrong with me I&#x27;d feel very awkward to visit a psychiatric for nothing

 Looking at buying in bau tram ward in long Khánh city. Where would be the best place to find available properties online?
 Not heading back across until November, so I’m trying to get a feel for the market. 
 Looks to be a few on Facebook, but I’m also concerned about the scams / fake ads. 
 Any direction would be great. 
 Cảm ơn

                              <span>These inbred a-holes occasionally pull their table out in the open ,put it in the middle of the sidewalk and start to drunkenly cursing loudly for everyone to hear while drinking nonstop. These criminals from lower caste raise chickens and rooster for illegal cock fights and the roosters always crow at 2Am disrupting everyone else’s sleep .It’s sad that the local police favors these criminals since the dirty money get from orchestrating the cock fight pay the police well. Corrupted city that act a safe haven for criminals. What a sad country full of decadency

                              <span>For context, I’m an American who’s engaged to a Vietnamese woman and we are living in the US. I noticed pretty early on when she eats she tends to make quite a bit of noise and chews with her mouth open. This is something that kind of drives me insane but I’ve gotten used to it. When I met her parents I noticed her Dad made some interesting noises as well. I did gently tell her once for her own awareness that many Americans consider these things rude or slightly gross, but mostly because I didn’t want her to feel embarrassed if she didn’t know. With things like noodles or soup I can understand to a degree but sometimes it’s almost distracting. Is this just a cultural difference and do Vietnamese people have no problem with it?
 Edit: thank you to all those who provided their thoughts and aren’t so sensitive they somehow took this personally lmao, I appreciate it!

                              <span>Sorry I didn&#x27;t see much specific to Ha Long Bay or cruises in the sticky post. I&#x27;m planning on pulling the trigger tomorrow on one tomorrow. I have been doing some research over the week and I&#x27;m finding myself a little overwhelmed by the options. Anyone try these out? Things you liked or didn&#x27;t like? Was there anything you wished was available or anything that was you didn&#x27;t need or want? It seems like the activities are based on the boat you choose. This is our first time visiting the country and I&#x27;m thrilled for the new experience. Any input would be appreciated!

                              <span>I live in South Dakota (Midwest US), and the people who own the nail salon I go to are Vietnamese. They just bought it a few months ago, and in that time they&#x27;ve sent me home with lots of different homemade dishes; bánh mì, bún thịt nướng chả giò, bún bò Huế, and bánh xèo for starters - all incredibly delicious. They don&#x27;t want me to pay for it, saying they&#x27;re just happy someone loves their food. I&#x27;ve increased my tip, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if etiquette called for something more.

                              <span>Hello all!
 I am an Irishman in Hue for the four months, and looking for a way to practice bass as I play in a band at home. So far I haven&#x27;t been able to find either an electric or an acoustic bass in Hue music shops, and I&#x27;m wondering if one of you lovely folks could point me in the right direction?
 Am I more likely to find a bass in a pawn shop? Or, if any of you are from Hue, do you have any musician friends who might have seen one for sale?
 Thanks very much!

                              <span>I saw this in some vietnamese text. But I&#x27;m not sure if &quot;yahh&quot; is more refering to the English &quot;yeah&quot;, in a informal and casual sense. Or is it a funny ironic english spelling of &quot;Dạ&quot; which the very polite interjection in Vietnamese. Or is there no relation?

 Im visiting Vietnam in November and have always dreamed of laser eye surgery so I can ditch my glasses. Does anyone here have experience with a clinic in Ho chi minh city that performs it?

                              <span>Full context, I’m a tourist. 
 I’m just wondering what you think it would take to change mindsets about littering?
 Today I was sitting by a small river in Hoi An and there was a tea vendor who came over and tossed two beer cans and a styrofoam package into the water. Not even 7m from him other locals fishing. 
 And I just can’t help but wonder, does he not know that pollution kills potential income and food for his neighbors? Is it education that’s needed?
 Or is it something else?
 And I’m not judging here, I’m honestly curious about why littering is so common in some SE Asian countries. (I had a similar experience while trying to scoop up trash that kids were throwing into a river in Thailand. Which they thought was hilarious for me to do.)

We will be performing in Hanoi next month (on May 13th at the Vietnam Improv Festival)....BUT in Hanoi we will be performing only in English... but for the purpose of this Reddit post, we want to try to be as bilingual (English + Vietnamese) as possible in our show. (We won&#x27;t use any/much Japanese in our show since the audience will be English/Vietnamese speakers in Hanoi).
 To help us best connect with the audiences in Vietnam, we are wondering if there are some simple phrases, slang, lingo, or even places, events, school/university, companies in Vietnam/Hanoi) we could learn and try to bring into our scenes.

                              <span>Hi, I’m studying in the US and is set to return to Vietnam this June. I wanted to see how dating is like in Vietnam, specifically Hanoi, before officially returning so I got on Bumble and let’s just say I am scarred for life.
 Every guys I have talked to kind of expressed that I was not good-looking to them. I am 5’2 (163 cm), which is said to be average height but most guys told me I would have a difficult time finding a partner in Vietnam bc that’s too tall. One guy said I looked like a random Tiktok man and another said I looked prudish when his goute was “modern women.” I asked what do modern women look like and he said “someone who is stylish and knows how to take care of herself.” He further said since I went to a Western university, I should have adopted their way of dressing up: more revealing clothes and heavy makeup. I told him that here in the US, it is not that common to see students dressing up and have a full-faced makeup every day. Then he kept asking for bikini and croptop pics. Though I don’t wear bikini, I like crop tops so I can send him some, but I declined bc I think it’s rude to ask for these photos because he wants “to have some motivation to tán me”.
 At first, I just want to find someone I can talk to but these interactions really crushed my confidence and made me hyper-aware of my looks. I wouldn’t say I’m ugly and I have never heard that from anyone else. In fact, a lot of people (both Vietnamese and American) called me cute or pretty. My clothes are not out of style at all. I just don’t like too revealing clothes and don’t like wasting time on heavy makeup. I guess the best word you can describe my style is classic Parisian (and occasionally basic hoodies + jeans). I am starting to doubt whether moving back home is a good idea as it feels like I would not fit in at all. 
 Maybe, I guess I just forgot how much Vietnamese cared about vanity.

                              <span>I’ve always found it interesting how despite Vietnam having an incredibly close relationship with nature whether that be with their treasured Buffalo’s, Whale worship (Cá Ông) or effective use of Guerrilla Warfare, that it’s currently the 2nd worst rated country when it comes to animal welfare, only beaten by China (https://theswiftest.com/animal-rights-index/). News of Animal Cruelty seems to be consistently coming out of Vietnam from dead whales washing up on shore in their droves without being investigated (https://globalvoices.org/2016/06/07/tons-of-fish-are-dying-mysteriously-in-vietnam-whales-too/amp/) to tiger/bear bile farms that operate despite prohibition (https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/news/hanoi-last-race-end-bear-bile-farming-vietnam-urgent-action-needed). This topic is interesting enough to me that I’ve been conceptualising a potential documentary on the subject and was wondering why people think it even got to this point? Globalisation? Influence from China? Simple lack of legislation or awareness? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with the topic.

                              <span>I love Vietnam for being a socialist country, but do the people believe that is the current economic system? Reformation didn’t mean capitalism took over (in my opinion).

                              <span>Sorry in advance, if this is the wrong subreddit to post this here, as I could not find any Vietnam History specific sub-reddit.
 Hi everyone!! I am Pranjal(Male from India). I am highly interested in urban history-seeing how urban spaces originate and grow. Hanoi was of particular interest to me as it possibly is the continuously inhabited oldest city in SEA(from time of Dongson Culture- Co Loa). 
 I have spent the past month charting out the history in Hanoi from Co Loa, Northern Domination, Thang Long, French Colonization, Socialist era and post Doi Moi era(till around 2018) going into as much detail as possible. I just landed in Hanoi yesterday and plan to be here for a week. As part of my (amateurish) research, wanted a perspective from a Hanoi local as well who has an interest/knowledge regarding Hanoi&#x27;s history(especially regarding the architectural history). In return for the help, more than happy to share my knowledge regarding history, bear any transportation/food costs, even cook some Indian food for you :) etc 
 Also if in case you have reference of some paid historical service/tour group which can give me an holistic overview of Hanoi from Co Loa to present( I couldn&#x27;t find any), that will be great as well. 
 Thanks in advance for the help :) 
 The sources that I have used so far-
 1. Hanoi: Biography of a City - William Stewart Logan
 2. Vietnamese Architecture - Le Phuoc
 3. Van Horen, B. (2005). City profile Hanoi. Cities, 22(2), 161–173.
 4. The new Hanoi: Opportunities and challenges for future urban development- Divya Leducqa, Helga-Jane Scarwellb
 5. The origins of Ancient Vietnam- Nam C. Kim

 But i never asked them how they actually felt about Thailand (or any other SEA country that doesn&#x27;t border Vietnam) in general, since they just know us as a femboy country with good food and strong gaming culture
 How do you feel, as a Viet? I&#x27;d like to hear

                              <span>If you&#x27;re driving around, you can often see symbol like this written on the side of the truck&#x27;s doors. 
 https://i.imgur.com/00jQDgE.jpg
 Most often, these are written like a fraction, so: 850 kg / 5N. 
 As an engineer, I got used to units and my 1st thought was: kilogram (kg) per Newton (N) does not make any sense. They are both related via F &#x3D; ma, so why divide them? And it&#x27;s not like the division will yield &quot;a&quot; which is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. 
 Anyway, I found out today after speaking with a trucker: N means Người aka passenger 🤣 So it lists the max no. of passenger you are allowed in the truck.

 I was born with my right hand missing at the wrist, I can still hold a handle bar with it but obviously can&#x27;t accelerate or break. Currently living in Hanoi. Any info or advice greatly appreciated! Cheers

 How much would I need to pay them a month? 
 Also, how easy is it to find a ceramicist? 
 Are Vietnamese ceramicists able to work with porcelain clay or do they only work with white clay?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am looking for a full set of dice for Dungeons and Dragons (see the picture for reference). I noticed there&#x27;s a lot of stunning stone art in Vietnam and I&#x27;ve been looking for those kind of dice for a family member. It doesn&#x27;t have to be fancy jade/gems, but ideally solid stone.
 Thanks for your suggestions.

                              <span>I want to depict the culture correctly. The character himself is a young 21 year old male who is a second generation American, both his parents were also born in the United States and his grandparents are from Vietnam. Character-wise he is very much a happy-go-lucky person, always follows the rules, and is always looking on the bright side of situations and is looking for a career in culinary arts. (This is just a general character description I don&#x27;t want to get into a plot synopsis)

                              <span>I&#x27;m stood here queueing since before 8pm to get through the check-in, immigration, boarding pass check x 2 and also need to get to the gate. It&#x27;s 10pm on a tuesday and our flight is at 11.25pm, we got to the check in desk 10 mins after it opened to be met with a huge snaking queue.
 I know they were in my case internal flights, but Da Nang and Hanoi airports were an utter breeze in comparison.
 Why is everything so slow and inefficient at this airport? Is it always this terrible?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been travelling a few weeks here and I&#x27;ve seen in some squares, especially Hanoi and Sa Pa people playing some kind of badminton ball but heavier using the feet. It also makes sound. It looks very fun and I want to bring it to my country as I&#x27;ve never seen it but I&#x27;ve been looking around and couldn&#x27;t find it! Many thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>Hey everyone, me and my partner are travelling from the UK to Vietnam next week (for 14 days). We are taking over with us 30 million VND in cash and have recently seen we need to declare this as it&#x27;s over 15 million (conflicting information on Gov.uk website). How do we do this? Is it done when we arrive in Vietnam? On the plane? Before we go?? 
 Our airline (bamboo airways) unfortunately hasn&#x27;t been any help and their correspondence tells us to ask the UK Government. 
 Thankyou for any help!

                              <span>My GF and I are currently in HCMC, and are considering doing a tour of the Cu Chi tunnels. However, both of us are somewhat overweight (and quite tall as well) and we have heard the tunnels are a very tight fit.
 We are wondering if it is worth visiting, even though we probably can&#x27;t fit in much of the tunnels?

 And I also see that conscription Is a big part of the military, with male citizens joining the military for 2 years. But my question is, does the conscription system work for Vietnam ? It appear to me that Vietnam use the Soviet model for conscription. With field formations consisting of masses of infantryman, as a result of such a large number of soliders; the training, tactics, communication of those units are simplified. 
 And with most cases, when a person complete his 2 years tour, he goes home, meaning that anyone who replace him, need to be train again. Large amount of money are used to train and retrain unit…</span>

 I am a Swede with half Vietnamese blood. I have lived in Sweden since I was a child and sometimes return to Vietnam after getting married. About 2 years ago, also in April, I was stuck in Vietnam due to the outbreak of COVID. I was surprised to see that the media in Vietnam often publishes positive news about the local epidemic situation but spread the opposite news about other countries, especially the West and the US. I remember they said that American people have no food and students have to eat leftovers. When I asked my wife (100% Vietnamese and her family lives there), she said it&#x27;s normal with TV stations there. Then, when the nightmares of the epidemic passed and we returned to Sweden, we kept receiving calls from her family in Vietnam, asking if we were okay and hungry because television often broadcast news about the bad situation. like Europe is about to enter the stone age —a food crisis, a gas crisis, that sort of thing. And most recently, when we planned to join a tour, which included a visit to the West Coast of the US, there were calls from her family again, like, be careful of the shootings!
 But yesterday, when my wife showed me this statistic, I just... I wondered what was going on. After the wars, why do Vietnamese people have such warm affection for America?

You could say I&#x27;m looking to &quot;picking up girls&quot; and I&#x27;d love to hear some advice how people roll with this kinda thing here. Where would be the best locations and what is and isn&#x27;t generally accepted here when flirting or trying to get closer to someone.

                              <span>Hello people,
 I am going travelling around SE Asia for a couple of months but I am worried about travelling with my ADHD medication. I am unsure of the legality of Elvanse in Vietnam as it is an amphetamine based stimulant, so I was considering switching medication to Concerta (methylphenidate) and bringing in a 2 months supply with a doctors note.
 This is not ideal but it will keep me going. 
 I have tried calling the Vietnamese embassy but I am sent straight to an answer machine with no option to speak to a human and I have tried to book an appointment but they are jam packed until July 😬 
 If anyone could shed any light on the legality of both Elvanse and Concerta in Vietnam I would be incredibly grateful. First hand experience is great too but it would be amazing if someone had some solid legal advice with a link or something. Just to put my mind at ease 😎 
 Also, I’m sorry if this question isn’t permitted on this sub - just remove it.
 Thank you 😊

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I am curious to know what is your impression/thoughts of Vietnamese food when you see it through pictures, videos, etc. Do you like it, find it appealing or not?
 Therefore, I am conducting research for my graduation thesis with the topic &quot;The effect of Vietnamese food&#x27;s visual experiences on tourists&#x27; emotions and travel motivation&quot;. And I am collecting data through this survey https://forms.gle/D1ZrPZhjjDCTU2uZA so I really appreciate if you can spend only about 5 minutes to share your thoughts on the survey because I really need 30 responses more.
 Thank you so much in advance.
 I would really love to discuss Vietnamese food with you.

Can anyone tell me if this is just paracetamol?

                              <span>Hello there! My business is looking into hiring a remote worker to help us with our production needs. We&#x27;re a video production agency so our first need is an editor and maybe an assistant eventually. 
 Are there any agencies or companies similar to https://www.supportshepherd.com/ that could help us find and vet candidates for us to hire? They are based in the Philippines, but as I&#x27;m a VK, I would prefer to hire from Vietnam if possible. 
 Thank you!

Ngôi trường mình đang học là trường do bố mẹ mình lựa chọn ( kiểu trường nhà nước, phải thi công chức ) toàn lũ cocc, chắc suất vào ngành còn mình thì nản từ hồi mới vào trường rồi vì học xong ra trường thi đỗ thì cũng kiếm được 2-3 triệu/ tháng. Mình cũng thử đá sang các ngành khác nhưng cũng không khả quan hơn là bao. Mình biết mình còn trẻ và không sợ thất bại nhưng thất bại 2-3 lần khiến mình bị khủng hoảng vì mình không giỏi như bản thân và mng nghĩ. Mong mọi người cho mình lời khuyên với, mình cảm ơn nhiều ạ !!!

                              <span>Today is the first day in the last exam week to end second semester of grade 12. That exams today are very important but i blanked the answer papers in history and geography, but i did finish the literature paper. I know i am rlly a bad student, i once didnt have so many friends in primary and middle school, they once isolated me so i used to try to cut off online connection with them to study more concentrate, in grade 8 my schl used to end at 11:45 am and then i just went home nap til 2 pm and then woke up and start to do hws til 5 pm, then just another break and start w hws again at 7pm and stayed up very late until 3 or 4 am. But my marks didnt get better, it was still low like 4 or 5, and then my classmate at middle school started to bully me like “why you so dumb but u still going to school” “why dont you stay home and do an deadend job(minimum wage job) in the future” “you are humiliating ur parents”, even the teachers humiliated me. It didnt change since i moved to highschool, i cannot change but i ask my parents to move to college or just study for some job thats ez but they want me to study uni. My life is such a mess when i am born in this world

 This task is simply calling a business and asking the person a couple of questions. I would do it but it would be expensive to call HCMC from the USA and I don’t speak Vietnamese.
 And I’m happy to PayPal for your help.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a Vietnamese looking for remote work opportunities for US companies from Vietnam. I work in Marketing (not as good as STEM jobs but still good enough), and I have already had experience working for international companies. Is it feasible to work remotely for a US company from Vietnam considering time zone differences and competition in the Marketing field? I&#x27;d love to hear advices from people who have done remote work like this. Thanks in advance!

She told me to keep it on the windowsill until it&#x27;s warm enough to plant it outside and to keep the dirt moist. I did as she told me and the plant did well the first couple of days but now it&#x27;s starting to wilt and the leaves changed colors, got paler. She also has no idea what I did wrong. I didn&#x27;t find any help on any other forum so I wanted to ask here, maybe someone has more experience with this plant.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m asking this with utmost respect and hope I&#x27;m not offending anyone! I&#x27;m writing a play including a male Vietnamese character, and I don&#x27;t want to pull a JK Rowling, so I wanted to ask actual Vietnamese people if that name makes sense and could be used.
 Yen Hao is supposed to be the first and middle name, Dong the surname. I know that with Vietnamese names, the surname usually comes first. But my play takes place in Czech Republic, and from what I&#x27;ve seen, Vietnamese people around here usually use the Czech order of names (so given name(s) first, surname second).
 If the name is incorrect, I&#x27;d be very glad to hear alternatives! He&#x27;s based on the character of Yevgeni Dorn from Chekov&#x27;s Seagull, so I&#x27;m looking for a name that sounds vaguely similar, although it&#x27;s in a different language. Thanks for any help:)

If you don&#x27;t like it here then why would you be living there huh? It&#x27;s like the prime example of internet toxicity. Update: Yeah I looked at the replies and then looked at my post again, I do sound like a bloody hypocrite kek. Pardon me if you had to go through this kind of post. I&#x27;ll try to, keep it to myself next time.

                              <span>My friends of mine recently came back from their business trip in Australia. They said that normally most of the shops close at 6-7pm and on weekend most of them are closed. I was kind of surprise hearing this, I also asked my friend living in Canada and he confirmed the similar thing. They all agreed that it was boring to live there. But for me, I feel sad for Vietnamese people who has to get up early to work or stay late to work too. I said to my friends, we are poorer so we spent all time in a day to work. They close shop at night and on weekend so they have quality time for them and they are not really obsessed of making money. What are your opinions on this, from outside and inside VN people?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have been in Vietnam for a week. Since getting here, my phone has gone from working essentially the same as back home (The US) to dying more quickly than charging when plugged in (it only actually charges with the phone turned off), and dying very quickly when not off the charger. When put into airplane mode and with no wifi connected it seems to deplete more slowly. 
 These are my guesses as to what is going on:
 a) the combination of charger box and charger cord I have are weak, I should try and find a stronger cord
 b) I am using Verizon&#x27;s international plan and don&#x27;t have a SIM card yet, so having my cell service and mobile data turned on is killing my phone. 
 I will go out and buy a stronger charger today and likely be getting my SIM installed either today or tomorrow. 
 Are there any other problems that could be happening based on anyone&#x27;s experience that I could be missing? It&#x27;s starting to make things quite challenging so I&#x27;d love any ideas as to how to help!

                              <span>I am a sole us citizen. I plan to gift money to my extended family in vietnam, about $65k. I know they have chase and citibank branches in vietnam. Can I just deposit money to my chase or citibank checking account and make a withdrawal when I get there? Or are the branches not internationally connected? What might be the associated fees?
 I do not have any work visa, id be just visiting, I dont think I can open a vietnamese account to transfer money to.

                              <span>Hi there!
 I am curious about how buying property in VN works? I am a British Born Vietnamese with the possibility to get a VN passport as my parents were born there. I am hoping to one day relocate to VN and was wondering how the process works?
 If anyone has any experience purchasing as an expat I&#x27;d love to know more about the process and it would be highly appreciated!

Trúng gió - for example perplexed me for years.. usually they relate this to family members getting sick from being outside or exposed to wind. From my understanding, it is the western equivalent to catching a cold. Maybe for older folk who have health conditions should be worried, but people are outside in wind all the time, yet it&#x27;s spoken about like a death knell waiting to happen to you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for three weeks and have yet to see someone who appeared to be homeless. Nor have I seen anyone with visible mental illness (schizophrenia, etc).
 In all that time I&#x27;ve also been approached only once by someone who was asking for money (we&#x27;d call it begging where I&#x27;m from.). 
 What&#x27;s the deal? Is it tight familial structures that keep people from being homeless or is it the state taking care of them.

                              <span>Hey, I was extreme curious about Vietnam, so that I decided to spend my full 2 weeks of vacation to travel down from Hanoi to da nang. Initially I planned to come here around eastern, so the beginning of April, but due to projects at works I needed to postpone my stay by 3 weeks.
 Now I arrived in Hanoi and it’s extremely cloudy / gray and the locals told me that this is the weather I need to expect for the next 2 weeks.
 I was wondering if I should fly down to hoe chi minh and then travel up to da nang.. cause that’s where my flight starts to Cambodia (my next stop)

                              <span>Apologies if this is a silly question but I’ve been in Vietnam for a month and keep being told it’s a communist country and I obviously see all the iconography everywhere but I haven’t seen much actual evidence that the economy is actually centrally planned. Are the major corporations owned by the government like china? Are most personal assets owned by the government like the USSR? What in policy actually makes it communist?

                              <span>Hi, some guide from my origin country said that it is very likely to get robbed in daylight, get your bug cut off or phone grabbed. Is it true? Sounds like a boomer stressing bs but idk. Other stuff i should be worried about? We are a couple traveling, 26f and 30m, western looking. Thanks :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for two weeks now and it&#x27;s an amazing and beautiful country and culture. The only thing I&#x27;ve been disappointed with has been the weather. I love sunny days no matter the temperature and I&#x27;ve looked at the forecast multiple times to see &quot;sunny&quot;. But not once has there been any blue sky. Is this smog or something else?
 Also I&#x27;m in Sapa at the moment and cannot see the mountainous backdrop due to this haze which is very disappointing.

                              <span>I visited the island of Phu Quoc 8 years ago, and returning there this week, I was shocked to see how much it had been transformed, particularly with the creation of a gigantic fake European ghost town in the south of the island, and a pseudo attraction park in the north, where young Vietnamese can be seen parading in Venetian dress and singing opera. Everything seems far from the Vietnamese culture. I am also shocked by so much money spent when Phu Quoc clearly suffers from a lack of hygiene and waste management. But I may be influenced by my European culture, so I would like to have your opinion on the matter.

                              <span>So title is self explanatory what is your favorite tuong ot(spicy hot sauce) in Vietnam?
 For me I think the best by miles is Sriracha(probably biased cause thats most of what I had all my life)
 Chin Su seems more salty than spicy.

But I have no idea what it means or where it comes from? From what I translated its land owned by Uncle 7?
 I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this for me. Does anyone know the origins of this username/nickname? Is it a reference to something specific or just a made-up name? Any information would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Chao Anh and Ems, Im a Viet born in Sweden in the early nineties. Probably one of the most foreign subgroup of VN people and if you ever meet one you know we are weird af, hopefully always in a good way tho. People say I dont even look Viet (In Vietnam) , but I know I&#x27;m at least 4 Nguyens generations deep and Ive been visiting my great great grandfathers tombs out there in the jungle, so I should qualify!
 But as far as Vietnamese people and culture go we are useless! We understand Vietnamese in a weird way like only spoken Vietnamese and it should be in a specific context like when you are angry af, it&#x27;s very selective. And it helps if you sound like my parents, if you have different dialect then sorry không hiểu gì hết!
 I have decided to change that and start hiểu that part of me, Ive been visiting Vietnam (mainly HCM), for a few weeks at the time, for a couple of years now. And guess what my language improved a little bit! This last year Ive visited more than 12 weeks, and the idea of relocating doesn&#x27;t seem too crazy to me anymore, and actually at this stage of my life kinda makes sense, its a great challenge for me personally, and I honestly feel a little bit bored and in some ways limited here in Sweden.
 So whats my problem, just move!? Well If could just move I would but I need to find qualified work first. Im a software engineer working full-stack with a couple of years experience. Im already looking at some standard stuff that might fit me through regular channels e.g. linkedIn, and I will keep looking there. But its a jungle out there, for a guy who doesn&#x27;t know the job market over there it all could be a hit or miss. 
 Hopefully somebody here has been in a similar situation and can share their experience or have any good insights, or even better set me up! Help a brother from another mother come home!

                              <span>We&#x27;re a couple in our mid-thirties planning a move to Vietnam this September, and would love your opinions on which city would suit us best. We love food, culture, music and easy access to nature/green spaces (inside and outside town) above all. Our party days are not over, but we gravitate more towards conviviality than blind drunkenness, and would love to create connections with locals and not just foreigners :) 
 Pros and cons of both cities in relation to the above?
 Thanks in advance!

What is a trustworthy place in Saigon to get an iPhone and has somebody experience with getting a VAT Refund when flying out from Saigon? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello. I will be visiting Phu Quoc in a few days, and I heard that the city is famous for its pepper.
 I&#x27;ve been to Phu Quoc before, but that time I visited a place called King Kong Mart, and there were so many pepper brands that I didn&#x27;t know which one to buy.
 If there are any pepper brands worth buying, please recommend!

 What would be the equivalent at a Starbucks for example? 
 My coffee knowledge is terrible so I have no idea where to start?!!

                              <span>I don&#x27;t like the chili sauce factories in Vietnam because the flavor doesn&#x27;t taste authentic. I usually make homemade sauce, but it&#x27;s best with soup rather than dry foods like sausage or fried chicken. I&#x27;ve found that habanero chili sauce is much better. Therefore, I want to distribute habanero or ghost pepper chili sauce in the Vietnam market. Do you think this is a good opportunity? thanks

                              <span>We are here travelling for a few weeks and stumbled across an amazing and fascinating scene yesterday, hoping someone can clarify what it was
 We walked around a corner near the lake in Hanoi to see a group of people shouting and frantically unloading these giant fish (I think they were carp) out of the back of a motorbike. There was a lot of flailing arms, flailing fish, commotion etc as they quickly grabbed and tossed all of the fish into the lake. Some of the fish were massive, so slippery that they were dropped onto the floor and ushered into the water by land.
 A security guard then blew his whistle and they all quickly started praying/meditating, before jumping on their bikes and riding away.
 It was pretty fascinating to watch and our best guess was that it&#x27;s related to a buddhist fish ceremony. 
 Are we correct and does it happen a lot at Hoan Kiem lake? Where do they likely get the fish from if so?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! I’m planning a trip through Vietnam and want to visit a rural village while there. I especially would love a place with rice paddies.
 I’ll be traveling from Hue -&gt; Ha Long Bay -&gt; Hanoi (flying out of Hanoi). Maybe there are some cool rural villages/farming areas en route between those places?
 I had my heart set on Sapa, but I don’t think I’ll have the time to go that far north from Hanoi :(.

                              <span>Hello everyone! Please let me know whether this question is appropriate or not for this sub.
 I just wanted to ask if anyone here has used the Wise (formerly Transferwise) travel card in the country as a tourist? I currently live in Japan and plan to convert some money to put onto it but I’m worried about being able to use it to withdraw cash at local ATMs (as it’s my first time visiting the country and I hear most places will only take cash).
 I heard Agribank has the lowest fees (and a reasonably generous daily limit on withdrawals) so I was considering trying to use the Wise card to withdraw cash from their ATMs. Does anyone know if this will work? 
 TIA!

                              <span>I’m looking for recommendations for a town or city on the coast for my father (64 year old English speaker) to spend two or three months. He’s looking for somewhere cheap to rent and a affordable. Not too built up tourist area as he has a limited income and not great vision. Through my own research and brief visit I thought Hoi an might be appropriate spot but I’d really appreciate any suggestions from this group. If this question would be better suited somewhere else again let me know. A million thanks.

                              <span>Literally asking for a friend as I think this is entirely stupid, but is it possible to buy 10 to 20 thousand dollars worth of gold bullion with a credit card. Specifically, do gold shops accept amex in vn?
 It would need to be bullion so they can stick it up their ass or whatever and smuggle it wherever they are going. 
 I have to ask as it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d ever think of but it&#x27;s exactly what they want to do....

                              <span>This community has been a huge help so I wanted to share my experience with getting voice and data on my iPhone 11 in Ho Chi Minh City. 
 I did not get a Sim at the airport because of a post I had read earlier about someone having problems with there sim. 
 Instead I used the airports Wi-Fi to order a grab and then walked to a viettel dealer the next day which allowed me to explore the neighborhood. ( don’t forget to bring your passport 😬)
 I got a 30 day prepaid plan with voice and 4G LTE data for 170,000 VND which is 7.24 USD I have no idea how many gigs I get but I use it to FaceTime my friends and parents and listen to Spotify. Might hotspot if I get this online teaching gig but I’ll keep my 🤞. Anyways…
 (This doesn’t include the 60,000 VND it cost for the grab rides to and from the Viettel store because I had forgotten my passport at the hotel. 😂)
 I did walk a total of 4 miles that day and felt pretty amazing afterwards so it was worth it 🙃🥳
 I look forward to the weekend and exploring District 1. So far the people here have been awesome and I really feel welcomed!

                              <span>HI everyone! I am currently studying engineering in Australia and I have to design a housing community in a Vietnamese village called: 
 Bình Thành, Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam
 Now the scenario goes this way, In this village lets say there was a natural disaster recently and I have to construct a housing system for 75 families that will at least last next 3 generations. 
 Regarding this i would highly appreciate if you can answer my question. Even great if someone&#x27;s originally from there. 
  
what are the typical housing system there?
 what about common disaster that i have to take in account
 family structure?
 environmental advantages and dis advantages 
 what if i was to reconstruct those family&#x27;s near a flowing water supply like river/ canal...would it be possible or logical? 
 hospitality of people among themselves?
  
That&#x27;s it for now. Please, any sort of help I&#x27;ll really appreciate: paragraphgs, artcles, images(even greater) but anything is fine. Thanks a lot.

                              <span>Hello people of r/Vietnam!
 I&#x27;m travelling to HCMC next month and looking for local music venus where they invite indie, alternative, rock or techno musicians. I only recently found out the hidden gems thanks to Saigon Supersound.
 I could find some conventional clubs or bars but they don&#x27;t seem to care much about music but only attract thousands of uninteresting tourists.
 Any insider&#x27;s information about clubs, cafes, bars, concerts or music festivals are much welcomed. If you know communities, websites or magazines that&#x27;ll be also awesome!
 I&#x27;d appreciate your recommendation or tips on how to explore the local underground music scene.
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>I’ve been traveling for a year and just spent 2.5 months in India, and I have been lucky to not experience anything like this. 
 It’s 9am and I’m biking through the rice fields in Hoi An. A scooter drives past me and stops ahead about 10 meters. The guy gets off and heads to the side of the road. I know what this is cause I have ridden by men peeing a couple times now. 
 But this time was different. He was turned towards me at 45° angle and holding his erect junk in his hands. His face was turned towards me. I gasped and looked away and then covered my face and eyes as I rode past him. Luckily I don’t think he followed me. 
 Wtf!???? Is this common???

 Edit: I had been looking at Kim Bespoke, Pham Custom Tailor and Nhut Tailor. 
 If you have any advice or info on these that would be great as well!

                              <span>Asking here because I suppose some foreigners in this chat would know some good rental places. I&#x27;m a local from Saigon, looking to rent a quality bike for some road trip riding. Preferably something like the Exciter or Winner because I&#x27;ll be riding into the mountains in Central highlands.
 Rental duration probably 3 weeks or so. But mainly, I&#x27;m hoping to find somewhere that can offer a bit of flexibility, because you never know what happens on a road trip. A plus point would be towing/recovery insurance just in case.

                              <span>Hello!
 This summer my friend and I are traveling to Hanoi for three days. I have been doing a lot of research and scouring this subreddit looking for help with things to do. I know three days is not a lot of time but I am torn about whether a trip to Ha Long Bay is worth it. It looks absolutely stunning but I know it is a hike to get there from Old Quarter of Hanoi. Was wondering for people who have been to Hanoi -- is two days sufficient to see the main sights? or given our limited time the day trip to Ha Long isn&#x27;t worth it? Would appreciate any insight from people who have been. Thank you and looking forward to my trip!

                              <span>Hello, I am currently on holidays in Vietnam and my flight back is in two days. I wanted to take a few bottles of rice wine home as a gift. However I am unable to find it. I looked in the supermarkets near me and also in the Saigon Centre. My hotel is in Distrikt 1, near the Independance Palace.
 Any help is appreciated :)

                              <span>Hello I’m not really sure if this is right place to post and please let me know of there is somewhere better to post about this 
 Long story short I am Australian and my dad (54M) started dating a Vietnamese woman (37F) right before Covid. How they met I believe was through an ex of his who was also Vietnamese. My dad went overseas a few times in 2019/2020 to visit her before Covid hit and the obviously couldn’t travel again. Then in late 2022 he moved the woman and her kid here into the family home despite myself and brother having never met them 
 I am aware he was sending her money while she was overseas and since they have arrived in Australia money is a big source of argument. I believe he is still sending money to her family and that his wife still has a Vietnamese bank account and has asked for his password to his bank account. She has brought up multiple times to me that she had looked to live elsewhere in Australia or go back to Vietnam once the date is up that they meet their visa requirements 
 This all seems very concerning to me but I’m interested to hear from the Vietnamese community if this is normal or if she is just using my dad for a visa and is going to leave?
 *Forgot to add they legally got married in Australia in February 2023. Did the fake wedding in Vietnam in 2022 which was to appease family apparently. My brother and I weren’t invited or asked to attend but then randomly two days before got asked write a speech for this woman we had never never met…

                              <span>With it being so hot currently in VN. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough electricity on the grid to run the AC properly cause everyone is running an AC. 
 I want to get a electricity regulator but wife keeps saying not to. Main reason is she says electricity will be much more expensive. I ask her how much more but she isn&#x27;t able to say.
 Does anyone know? So the reasoning is that let&#x27;s say you use 1 million a month usually, with the regulator, it will make the electricity proper voltage so using more electricity even though your using the same.
 How much of an increase do you think that will be?

                              <span>I struggle to understand Vinalogic and it makes me upset. Terrible driving, disregard for other people, loud and shouting, obnoxiousness, eating with open mouths, i can keep going. 
 At the start I looked over these things but it&#x27;s starting to bother me more and more. i don&#x27;t expect people to be like me and I don&#x27;t expect Vietnam to behave like my home country. I&#x27;m not trying to change the Vietnamese people but trying to change the way I see things.
 This isn&#x27;t a shit post or post to vent but more so a question of if it gets better or not.
 Im sure the bright eye bushy tail newbies will have something to say but I&#x27;m looking for advice from expats that have been here for 5 years or longer.

                              <span>So I need to get my clothes back from a laundry service, but the guy at the reception is taking a nap. I can see him sleeping behind the counter. Should I wake him up, or should I wait?
 I know it&#x27;s a common thing to take a nap around 12, and I don&#x27;t want to be rude. But I also need underwear 🥲 What&#x27;s the etiquette in this situation?
 Edit: So I waited untill 01:30 before waking him up. The guy was a heavy sleeper, I had to make so much noise. He got up, apologized and gave me my laundry back - it was right under the counter, I could have just grabbed it 😭

 I&#x27;m an Australian Vietnamese from Sydney. I might be relocating to Saigon shortly. Curious to whether there is a running or trail running communities in Saigon?
 Also where do you do long runs?

 Edit: referring to the American War. In my ignorance, I didn’t realize my American bias in calling it the Vietnam Conflict.

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 I&#x27;m travelling to Vietnam later this year and wanted to take my medication with me. The issue is that it requires a prescription which I dont have since I got it over the counter from a different country (but it is prescription only in my current country and cant be bought in Vietnam). 
 The medication is not an addictive/abusive or psychedelic substance (so no opioids and not a adhd/anxienty/depression medication or whatever), and Im only planning to take what I need with me, so no massive quantities either.
 Would I end up having any troubles taking it to Vietnam? Im not so worried if it gets confiscated, just dont want to end up in prison or anything. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hello, is it a common thing for vietnamese people to say the opposite of what they mean? 
 Like for example when they see a cute baby, I heard from a family member saying why are you so ugly? Their intent is to say the baby is cute but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a cultural thing or do I just have family members that can&#x27;t say how they truly feel.
 Cam on!

                              <span>Since I have a remote job, I&#x27;m going to visit Vietnam to work and play (and visit family). I have to bring my work computer of course. But I hear the border agents may start asking you questions if you bring a lot of electronics. I was planning to bring my work computer, personal computer, Nintendo Switch and possibly my DSLR. What do you think of this? Some friends are telling me to leave the DLSR and personal computer at home and some suggest my iPad instead of my personal computer so I&#x27;m not traveling with two computers. Any advice on this? I just prefer my personal computer for ease of use, multiple tabs, search history and research. I know I can do it all on my phone and iPad too. Also, how dangerous is it to bring your DSLR when visiting tourists areas? I know many photographers do it but I don&#x27;t want to lose anything on the trip or be a target for theft of course.
 ​
 Just any advice or personal opinions/experiences would be great.

                              <span>The indochinese tiger formerly common around Southeast asia have gone extinct in vietnam dued to be relentlessly hunted within vietnam.We would need to import tigers from surrounding countries that have tigers that are genetically similar to the former tigers of Vietnam. Money and people would be needed to do this.Restoring nature in vietnam would be a noble pursue and a good way to spend time without wasting your time.

                              <span>Got hit with my girlfriend on the back while we were pulling into our apartment. No oncoming traffic, I was signaling to turn left and a car hit the gas and tried passing us into where I was turning. 
 Luckily no major injuries, although I had to spend the whole morning getting checked and got some decent cuts on my feet (I guess sandals aren&#x27;t the way to go).
 It was a hit an run and the police already found footage of the car that hit me. But it&#x27;s all so avoidable if people just slow down. Also people on bikes need to learn how to use their signals because the car today just completely ignored mine. 
 Anyway, stay safe on the roads. I was as safe as I could&#x27;ve been and it still didn&#x27;t matter. I guess that&#x27;s the gamble you take every single day! 🎉

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I suffer from occasional panic attacks and sporadic moments of severe anxiety and I&#x27;m prescribed Alprazolam for this. 
 I have been travelling for a few months and my small supply has run out so I&#x27;m looking to buy a new box. 
 Has anyone got a good address where they don&#x27;t sell the fake stuff? Could be another brand as long as it is legit and not some weird concoction. 
 Before I left my doctor gave me a paper explaining that I need to take this medicine, but I don&#x27;t have a prescription for more at this present time. Does the paper (signed by the doctor) indicating that I am allowed to take this medicine as needed suffice to get it? 
 Also any idea on prices?

                              <span>I think it’s just so common as a Viet living abroad that random people shouting out Nihao or ching-chong all just straight up asking : Are you Chinese? Are you Korean? You look Chinese … etc. While in Vietnam, if we see a white person and we want to know where they’re from, we respectfully ask: Where are you from? We did not just straight up calling them French, Canadian or some nationality. We just referred to them as ”Tây” &#x3D; Westerner; or “Người nước ngoài” &#x3D; People from outer countries. If you’re back people will say you black. If you’re white people say you’re white. But when your EA or SEA or random Asian they say ‘Chinese’??? 
 Asia is so diverse, there are Laos, Mongolia, Malaysia, etc. :) Especially Vietnam has a painful history fighting back from China and suffers from cultures destruction and assimilation by Chinese, the feeling is worse. 
 I wish one day everyone can be more acknowledged of racial diversity in Asia and ask them more general question like : “Which part of Asian are you from? What’s your ethnicity?” Instead of labeling people with something that we are not sure of.

Cho đến bây giờ thì bạn ấy đã ct nyc nên tôi mới dám nói và bạn ấy cũng thừa nhận là đã có lúc bạn ấy cũng từng thích tôi, và bây giờ thì bạn ấy mới ct nyc nên cảm xúc rất rối loạn và k biết cảm xúc của bạn ấy với tôi là thật hay nhất thời, đến vài ngày sau thì tôi với bạn ấy vẫn ib như thường ngày nhưng tôi lỡ miệng nói ra là tôi bị tim và phổi bẩm sinh và k còn nhiều thời gian nữa nên giờ tôi k biết làm như nào, khi bạn ấy biết bạn ấy rất buồn và shok vì có quá nhiều chuyện ập đến với bạn ấy. Tôi đã chọn cách rời đi nhưng tôi bây giờ rất nhớ bạn ấy, các ông các bà cho tôi 1 lời khuyên với tời gian của tôi không còn nhiều nữa rồi.

 ex: Japan I heard their ATMs actually had better rates. But using their banks there, had a HUGE fee. 
 What should I do for Vietnam? My bank seems to have a really bad conversion.

I&#x27;m wondering if activities like cave exploring/ halong bay tours will be affected by the rainy season? Also is it pretty easy to stay out of the hot heat with A/C widely available in the city?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I found out today that my grandma from Vietnam has liver cancer. She’s in the last stage and she has very few years to live. My family is hiding that news from her, and I don’t feel good about it. I mean I understand their intentions of not telling my grandma that she has cancer for her mental health, etc. But it feels extra wrong because they lied to her and said that her tumor was benign. I feel like it’s fair to share the news when the time is right, so she can maybe live life a bit differently. 
 Maybe I’m just Vietnamese-American and I just don’t understand the culture. Can someone give me more perspective and understanding to this difficult situation?

                              <span>Hello Folks! This is the first time I&#x27;ll be DJaying at a Chinese/Vietnamese wedding and have no clue about good songs to play.
 I will be playing the usual global charts English music but I think it would also be good to infuse some popular Chinese or Vietnamese songs that the couple and their families might enjoy dancing to!
 Of course I tried looking at charts on Spotify etc but I think it would be more valuable to have suggestions from native people!
 Please recommend me some songs that I can play at the wedding party.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello everyone! Today I would like to discuss some tech and apps that can improve our daily routines. There are many apps and services that already make life easier in other countries. Some countries have completely automated and digitized everyday life. For example, there are apps that help with logistics such as scheduling appointments or managing deliveries; grocery delivery apps; payment apps that make transactions quicker and more secure. Doctor&#x27;s appointments, accounting services, freelance work - the list goes on. And it is not necessarily something complicated and expensive, some services are convenient and popular, although behind them is a small development team.
 So, please share the apps and services that you&#x27;re excited to try. Share your experiences and opinions, and feel free to elaborate on any particular features or benefits that you found most useful. Thank you for your input!
 Who knows, maybe it will come to life soon)

 Chuyện là người nhà mình có xài thẻ Credit của VPBank, nhưng hầu như không sử dụng để thanh toán thường nhật. Trưa ngày 10/4/2023 khi kiểm tra điện thoại, người nhà mình nhận được tin nhắn từ VPBank báo thẻ Credit của mình bị trừ tổng cộng 44.488.950 đồng, chia làm nhiều đợt giao dịch như hình đính kèm. Sau đó kiểm tra tài khoản VPBank thì đúng là có bị trừ thật. Sau khi phát hiện tài khoản bị trừ gần hết hạn mức 50 triệu thì rất hoảng loạn, vì theo cảm quan thì biết là đã bị hack tài khoản rồi, đối tượng sau khi hack thành công thì dùng số tiền này để chạy quảng cáo facebook, vì tin nhắn từ VPBank báo về trên điện thoại với nội dung như vậy. Sau khi gọi điện thẳng đến tổng đài của VPBank yêu cầu khóa thẻ khẩn cấp, thì vẫn thấy chưa yên tâm nên ngay sau đó chạy thẳng ra Ph…</span>

                              <span>I am considering a move to Ha Giang as it is one of the colder cities in Vietnam, but I am having trouble finding long-term rental listings on Facebook and other real estate websites. I was wondering if anyone else who is an expat currently lives in Ha Giang and could offer me some advice on how to find a place to live.
 I also have some concerns about moving to a smaller city, as I currently live in Hanoi. While I am drawn to the cooler climate and natural beauty of Ha Giang, I worry about the potential challenges of living in a smaller city with fewer amenities and opportunities.
 If anyone has made a similar transition from a larger city to a smaller one in Vietnam, I would love to hear about your experience and any advice you may have. How did you adjust to the change in pace and lifestyle? What were some unexpected challenges or benefits of living in a smaller city?
 Thank you in advance for your help and insights.

                              <span>Been trying to monitor my weight while not having a steady home to carry around / buy a scale.
 In Thailand a lot of the malls conveniently have scales that give you a pretty good reading for some pocket change.
 Has anyone seen these around in Saigon and if so at which malls? Also open to other venues of regularly getting my body weight measured.

                              <span>I am planning on going a trip to Vietnam for 2 months. I may take some private lessons at VLS, but they are a little expensive. If anyone has any recommendations for other good schools, I would be interested. I want to get a headstart first, as well as continue virtual lessons after I leave. There are a lot of tutors on iTalki, but I&#x27;d like hear firsthand from students who have been very pleased with their tutor.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be going to HCMC for the first time. Im researching which part of the city to book accomodation. 
 What i dont need is: bars, partying, tourist sites, etc
 What i like is: lots of walking along mom and pop shops, eating in local food shops, popping in for a foot massage from time to time.
 Are there pedestrian friendly neighborhoods that you like or would recommend?

                              <span>Went inside to test ride a small training bike for my 5 year old. Going on the first test ride, I noticed that the tires were nearly flat deflated. Obviously my kid struggled to ride it well.
 On the return around, I asked why is the tire deflated? Can you inflate the tire so we can have a better test?
 Their smart answer was, &quot;It comes from the factory like that. If you want us to inflate it, you&#x27;ll have to buy it first.&quot;
 Completely ridiculous. Mind you we are still evaluating and testing the product, and you want us to make a buying decision while the product is unusable? After that conversation, I noticed the handle bar was completely loose. Figures as much why my son struggle to turn the bike. I put the bike back to find another bike. The 2nd bike I found also had a handle bar that was also completely loose from the front wheel. Someone assembling the product in their department needs to be evaluated.
 Why on earth do you setup a display of bikes that are unprepared for test ride for children? Why is your smart response are that the bikes &quot;come from the factory like that&quot; an appropriate answer for deflated tires? And why do you expect people to buy it from you while they can&#x27;t even get normal working conditions to evaluate the quality of a product?
 I didnt expect this type of low end service behavior from buying at a department store, at a big mall no less.

                              <span>This question is not just for vietjetair, it helps me if you have the same issue with any other form in Viet Nam. :)
 I am a foreigner in Vietnam, when I buy a flight on Vietnam Airlines I have no problems because the website is well developed, but when I buy it on vietjetair, the website does not allow more than 25 characters in the given name and last name fields. I have a very long European given and last name and it doesn&#x27;t fit on the form.
 I always have to shorten it and that causes me a lot of problems at the airport because while passing control they stop me saying the name in the ticket is no the same name shown in the passport, I always waste time explaining to the staff that my name doesn&#x27;t fit on the form when I buy the ticket through the Web. Many times I have to wait until manager comes and tell me is ok after check my passport and explain again the issue and once I almost miss flight because they made me wait too long.
 I have contacted the company and they do not give me any solution. Anyone with the same problem?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Due to the low price of high quality cigarettes and the lack of availability of cigars, I&#x27;ve found myself caught in the net of cigarette addiction. 
 I&#x27;m having an incredibly difficult time finding things like nicotine patches, nasal sprays, lozenges, etc.
 All I can find is a product called Oh No from Long Chau pharmacy. 
 These small little bottles of lozenges really aren&#x27;t doing the trick for me. They are expensive and the bottles run out very quickly. 
 Has anybody else had success with finding a decent product around here?
 Even smokeless tobacco seems impossible to find. 
 I&#x27;m feeling desperate. 
 Thanks for your time.

                              <span>Hello guys, i have been living in Vietnam for 3 years and using an old Nouvou 4. After some road trips i have a desire to buy a better one. I am battling between NVX 155 and Airblade 150.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I am visiting beautiful Da Nang, and staying on the coast south of the city. Across the street there seems to be a lot of buildings that lack windows on the sides and only have front ones.
 Does anyone know why this is?

 Does anyone have experience with people from abroad doing business in Vietnam? To be more exact, let’s say wood pellet manufacturing and exporting abroad?
 Would appreciate any information, thank you and have a nice time!

                              <span>Hi, anyone here knows how to get from Võ Văn Tần, Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam to Dai Nam Go kart Theme Park? 
 I plan to rent a motorcycle, but I&#x27;m scared of being stopped by officers on the road. I have license, but I&#x27;m from a different country.
 ​
 Question is:
 - How to get there if I&#x27;m not going to use a rented motorcycle?
 - Is it safe to just go there using a rented motorcycle?
 - Should I book from taxi mobile application? 
 - Is commute an easy way?
 ​
 Thank you so much, Peeps!

                              <span>I am planning to arrive in HCMC tomorrow for 2 weeks with additional week in Da Nang. Seek your quick advice:
  
SIM Card?: I have been suggested its better to not buy at the airport. Plan is to get a Grab to my hotel, check in, and then find some shop for SIM Card. However, can you recommend which SIM Card/company is better? (Just want reliable internet/data)
 
Where to exchange currency?: While airport is a no go (will exchange just enough for taxi and check in), curious if there&#x27;re any specific places with great exchange rates? (Eg. SuperRich in Bangkok is known for its highly competitive exchange rate). 
 
 Or Is it feasible to withdraw money from the ATM? (Again, eg. in Bangkok, you are charged 220 THB right away for every ATM withdrawal so unless you&#x27;re withdrawing chunk of cash, its just dropping money on avoidable)
  
Worth it to drive moped/bike to get around? For reference, I have driven in South Asia so I am quite used to...uh, interesting drivers.

I’d like to buy a good amount, but not break the bank. Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>So! My factory has cats, and ants flock to our auto feeder that plugs in to feed them.
 Anyone know where in hcmc i can maybe buy something to stop it?
 Ive read about motes, not sure i can use it/make one that isnt too high. My cats are small still so they may not reach or knock it over trying to get high enough.
 I figured maybe someone in VN has the same problem and found a good way to stop, or bought something?

 ​
 So some background information. I&#x27;m an American who got a B.S. Electrical Engineering degree back in 2016. After school I ended up hating electrical engineering and took a job working in media out of college, but I hated that too. Then in early 2020 I switched careers to IT and got a bunch of basic IT certifications. I have been working as IT support for the last 3 years.

                              <span>Is the consulate in San Francisco open? Every time I call them, it just rings, then goes to mailbox, which is always full, so I can&#x27;t even leave a message. If they are open, can I just walk in to request getting my documents legalized?
 Appreciate any information on this.

 What fees are there? 
 Is it flat-rate or percentage? 
 Any currency conversion fees? 
 Is the sender or the receiver charged the fees?

                              <span>I left my phone in my grab at around 1am. I’m able to track it using my work phone and have been following it for most of the night.
 I set my phone as lost on ‘Find My iPhone’ with the following message Chiếc iphone này bị bỏ lại sau khi nhặt, vui lòng gọi (dads phone number here) để trả lại càng sớm càng tốt hoặc chuyển đến Fusion Suites Sài Gòn or WhatsApp (my phone number here, as I have WhatsApp on this phone instead of my personal)
 The best part is that as soon as I did that the driver did actually call my dad but unfortunately due to language constraints between the two they weren’t able to communicate effectively. 
 What’s frustrating though is that since then I have tried to call my phone multiple times and the driver has refused to pick up. 
 I have tried reaching out to grab via their helpline but the phone line keeps getting disconnected. I am also unable to sign into my grab account on this second phone as I need Facebook 2FA and the code generator is on my personal phone. 
 Just looking for advice, support, next steps or others who have faced something similar I guess. 
 I’m worried that the phone will eventually die and I will no longer be able to track it and then all hope is lost lol.

                              <span>Hey so I really need some advice, I’m currently in the USA I am a social worker, attempting to work with a Vietnamese family.
 Already there is a language barrier they speak very little English and when I try to use a translator it seems to upset them and they try to communicate with me in small phrases but obviously I lose meaning of what they try to say and they lose meaning of what I try to say.
 So far he has gotten mad at me twice, one for walking upstairs wit my shoes on and another by attempting to contact his wife without going through him.
 At this point I think I’m just culturally missing some elements that he is starting to take as disrespect, I have to talk to them again at their house in a few days and I’m not trying to get cursed out again in Vietnamese pls help.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;ll be moving to Saigon soon (district 1) and I was wondering if you can recommend stores in the area where I could buy some home essentials like small electronic appliances, kitchen utensils, bedsheets, towels, etc.
 Also, are there any supermarkets in district 1 where I could find Western products and ingredients? I have a senstitive stomach, so I might need some type to adapt..
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi people! This is my first time ever creating a post in Reddit. After searching through the internet I couldn&#x27;t find an answer for this question.
 How do you respond in Vietnamese when you get compliments appearance wise?
 I&#x27;m half Chinese and half Vietnamese living in Europe. In China you don&#x27;t really say thank you. You just downplay it or deny it playfully.
 I grew up ugly so I never had this encounter but now as an adult I have gotten couple compliments. I just don&#x27;t know how to answer other than giggling and shaking my head. Thank you for the help. ❤️

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am visiting HCMC in early June, partially as a vacation but partially to learn more about the local scene for entrepreneurs and freelancers. I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I&#x27;m strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.
 As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I&#x27;m not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.
 Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats? Anyone here running their own small business or online business in Vietnam and would like to meet for a coffee or beer?
 Thanks for reading!

                              <span>Xin chào, 
 I am currently travelling around Vietnam with my girlfriend and we are in Ninh Binh where it is raining today tomorrow with some thunderstorms(apparently) and I am just wondering what are common indoor activities or that when it is raining so much?
 Is it similar to other countries like bowling/cinema in bigger cities or is there some more localised activities?
 If anyone has any suggestions for Ninh Binh I&#x27;d be very thankful but it just made me think about everywhere else around the country too.

 Does anyone have any recommendations? I&#x27;ll only be there for 5 days so it&#x27;ll have to a quick one as well.

                              <span>Hi! I’m a computer scientist graduate looking to relocate from the UK to Vietnam in September. 
 I have almost 2 years internship experience with multinational corporations on top of my degree. I’m mostly interested in positions involving cloud, DevOps, networking and operating systems, rather than full time software development. 
 How easy would it be for a non Vietnamese graduate to find an entry level position? What would a reasonable monthly wage be? I’ve seen positions ranging from $900-2500, and was wondering what an acceptable range for negotiation would be. Lastly, are there any specific websites I can look for jobs? I’ve currently just been using LinkedIn, Glassdoor and indeed. 
 Thank you in advance for your help 🙏

                              <span>I arrived a few days ago and bought my SIM card at the airport. It’s 4GB/day with calling. 
 Randomly during the day my service will completely stop working. It’ll last for hours before it starts again. I’ve turned off my VPN, restarted my phone, turned on/off airplane mode. Nothing works. 
 Is this common and how do I fix it?

 I want to learn Vietnamese as well as the history of the country, yet it is very difficult to find content due to me not being able to read Vietnamese. Is there any form of media anyone can recommend? Please help! Thanks.

 I recently came across a painting, which I believe is the work of a talented Vietnamese artist. However, the signature on the artwork is a bit tricky to read, and I&#x27;m struggling to identify who the artist might be. That&#x27;s where your expertise comes in! 😄
 Here&#x27;s the signature:

                              <span>Is it worth to travel by train in Vietnam? How is the comfort and are delays common or are most train in time? Would like to take a train from Central Vietnam to HCM (about 12 hours ride) and take a plane from there later. Found a coonection with 4 hours arrival in HCM before the plane leaves. Is that a possible thing to do or do I need a lot of luck?
 Option b would be to arrive early in HCM airport and stay there over night, though not sure if thats recommended.

                              <span>I was on Ta Hien street last night and was planning to just walk (ten minutes) to the hotel but the obnoxious cab drivers would not stop pestering me so I just took a taxi. I told the driver my hotel name and he started driving and then takes me to like four different hotels and each time I say this is not my hotel.
 Finally he asks to use my phone for google maps and I hate handing my phone over but was tired and starting to feel sick. I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn&#x27;t hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.
 He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn&#x27;t) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn&#x27;t even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.
 POLICE are zero help because I don&#x27;t remember the drivers cab number. Is there ANYTHING I can do? My phone is not showing on the findmyiphone app.
