                              <span>Hi everyone, I need some travel related advice from a person familiar with these cities in Vietnam : Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue City. 
 I am from India and currently in Vietnam with my parents. I have been here for 6 days and visited Hanoi, Sa Pa, HaLong Bay and HCMC, and now moving on to Hue city by an early morning flight on 21st December, and my return flight back to India is in evening of 24th December from Da Nang. 
 The issue, now, is that the weather forecast shows it will more or less rain for next 3 days (21-24 December) continuously. I was currently planning to visit the Historic city of Hoi An, then Ba Na Hills through Ropeway and then Citadel in Hue city and then go back to Da Nang and take the return flight. 
 Can someone please help me figure out how many days I should spend in each city and what I should avoid doing to make the best of whatever time I have in these 3 cities. Or. Maybe I can go to a nearby city that has no rain and travel there? Open to suggestions.

                              <span>Just wanted to ask a simple question: What are the top 3 reasons why you love Vietnam? 
 No wrong answers here as I can think of many. 
 For me, I would say the Top 3 Reasons I Love Vietnam Are:
  
The people. The people here are absolutely incredible. 
 The beauty of the country. Vietnam has everything some of the best landscapes and scenery I have ever seen in my life. 
 The food. I know Vietnamese food might not be for everyone, but I really enjoy most of it. I think it is very unique, flavorful and tasty.

 My husband and I arrived at HCMC airport a couple hours ago - we’ve been in Thailand for the past couple weeks on holiday, and thought we’d pop over to Vietnam for a few days too. 
 When we came out the airport, one of the guys in a white shirt got us. All the advice we read beforehand was about metered taxis, and the guy said that the taxi is metered so we didn’t think anything more of it so it should be fine. Hopped in and asked to be dropped to our hotel in District 1. 
 No joke… the meter was going up 25k every 10 seconds. After less than 10 mins of driving, we told him it’s far too expensive and we need to get out. Paid 600k to be left on the side of the road :( wish we’d stuck to our guns and given him less, he made a stupid amount off our naïveté. 
 We ordered a Grab which dropped us the rest of the way for just 80k. In hindsight that’s what we should’ve done when we were looking for a taxi, but hindsight is always 20/20!

                              <span>I want to get any idea if there is any interest in a meet-up for this community in Saigon. I was thinking something informal at a pub one evening after the holidays. I like the community and would be interested in meeting some of you in person. If you have interest in a meet-up just reply below.

                              <span>There are still piles of glass outside. How does stuff not get cleaned up after two months? Kids and animals are running around here all day, hundreds of tourists walking past. I&#x27;m sure there will be some &#x27;good explanation&#x27; for it, probably involving liability or money, but really there is no excuse.

 Hi, can anyone recommend a hospital or clinic which will preform an abortion for a foreigner? Also how to contact them, email, website, phone? Should I expect the hospital staff to understand english? Should I get a translator?
 Thanks
 edit incase anyone has same question: FV hospital or Hanh Phuc Hospital for foreigners are known to provide abortions to foreigners

I have a bachelors degree in Biomedical science, and am more than willing to learn Vietnamese if needed. Are there any such opportunities like this for a British person there? I have tried looking into it a bit but can’t seem to find much information or opportunities, but maybe you guys here would know much more, thank you!

                              <span>Hi all been on this forum for a while. I am strongly considering moving to Vietnam. I’d love to have a scientific job there such as medical research, but I’ve done quite a bit of looking into this and can’t seem to find many opportunities, so I would probably go into teaching english.
 I lived in Saigon for about 6 months in 2020 with my now ex-gf, and I really loved it, and ever since have been a little obsessed with watching videos about it, keeping up with news/info there. My friends and family know I love it as I do speak about it with them sometimes.
 The problem is, while I was living there, I wasn’t actually working, so it was more of an extended holiday, and I know actually working there would be much different. I have a TEFL certificate and also a bachelors degree, and actually had an interview a while ago when I was considering moving there a year ago, and was offered a teaching job, but in the end I declined it.
 Only things that are stopping me are leaving my great friends and family here, learning to ride a bike there is a bit daunting (never driven one before), and maybe regretting my decision after taking the leap. 
 I am considering taking another holiday there for around a month and just kind of acting like I l live and work there, just to test it out, but not sure how useful that actually is.
 Anyway, if you have any thoughts on this let me know! And if you know of any medical science jobs there that a British person with a science degree could get into, please tell me (although I may make a separate post about this)!

Phiên bản City Edition sẽ chỉ có quãng đường đi được là 300 km khi sử dụng điện và xét rằng Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited dẫn động cầu sau (đầy đủ tải) có giá tương đương với VF 8 City Edition (khoảng 1,3 tỷ đồng) trong khi cung cấp quãng đường chạy điện là 485 km , điều đó có nghĩa là Vinfast VF 8 có thể sẽ khó bán ở Mỹ. Và xét đến việc Tesla Model 3 Long Range chỉ có giá khoảng 58.000 USD (khoảng 1,375 tỷ đồng) với phạm vi hoạt động 575 km và bạn có thể thấy rằng Vinf…</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m planning a two week motorbike road trip in Vietnam and I&#x27;m trying to decide where to go. I&#x27;m considering either starting in Ho Chi Minh City and making my way up to Hanoi, or just focusing on the northern part of the country. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any recommendations on which option would be the best for a road trip.
 I&#x27;m interested in seeing as much of the country as possible, but I&#x27;m also open to just staying in one region if it has particularly beautiful or interesting sights to see. I&#x27;m particularly interested in seeing more of the traditional Vietnamese culture and nature. 
 Is the southern part of Vietnam also worth visiting, or is Ho Chi Minh City the main highlight in that region?
 Any thoughts or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello people, my family and I have booked our flights to Vietnam. We will start in Hanoi and we will go to probably to Phu Quoc and Saigon at the end. What would you recommend to visit ? What are the most interesting places to visit, what are the best beaches ? We will be there for around two full weeks and I would love to experience everything of Vietnam and their culture.
 Thank you !

                              <span>Several days ago, I have read two articles that are critical about Vinfast.
 VinFast VF8 Is Simply Not Ready for America (jalopnik.com) 
 180 Miles for $55k: Can the 2023 VinFast VF 8 SUV Break Into America? (motortrend.com) 
 From what I have found out, the Vinfast VF 8 would cost at least $55k (Eco starts at $59k according to their site), and that the City Edition would only have 180 miles of range, which is a joke considering that most EVs have between 200-350 miles of range. The fact that the Vinfast name is weak compared to other brands like Tesla, Polestar, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, Ford, GM, Mercedes Benz, BMW, VW/Audi/Porsche, etc. won&#x27;t do it any favours either.
 In the US, with other EVs that are more competitive like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Hyundai Kona EV, Kia EV6, Kia Niro EV, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Polestar 2, BMW i4, Mercedes Benz EQB, Audi Q4 E-tron, VW ID.4, Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and the Tesla Model 3 (even its starting price now at $47k puts it at a better position than the VF 8, and that is after massive price hikes as the April 2021 price of the Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive sits below $40k), would Vinfast succeed or would they end up failing like Yugo (at least Yugos are cheap)?
 Also, how was the experience of Vinfast cars and EVs in Vietnam? Were they good or were they bad?

                              <span>Xin chào tất cả mọi người! Chinese guy coming in peace here.
 I was just killing some time being stuck in a Wikipedia/Wiktionary rabbit hole. By chance I found a few Vietnamese slangs/neologisms borrowed from Chinese, such as cao phú soái (高富帥) and cẩu huyết (狗血). 
 How commonly used are these phrases? Are there any controversies about borrowing phrases from Chinese?
 Are these phrases borrowed via TV shows from mainland China / Taiwan? How popular is Chinese-language entertainment in Vietnam?
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>Both my parents were born in Vietnam and are Vietnamese citizens (AFAIK). I want to be able to become a Vietnamese citizen and get a dual citizenship (US/Viet). My parents moved to the US in the 90s and have become US citizens in the mid 2010s. Some sources say you can get dual citizenship and some others say you must renounce foreign nationality. I&#x27;m very confused on which one is the most accurate and up to date fact. I am not willing to lose US citizenship over this.
 ​
 I do not want to go down the route of getting a business or work visa or doing the visa renewal trips every month or 3 months. I have a gf in Vietnam that I may end up marrying but in my opinion, that is not the safest route for myself because I don&#x27;t want to be deported if we ever seperate. I want to be independent and not have to rely on others for me to legally stay in vietnam. 
 I do have some family members in Sagion/Bao Loc but I am not very close to them. I can also speak basic vietnamese, as in I can navigate daily life but when it comes to reading gov&#x27;t documents and speaking on important matters I am not at that level yet. Basically at a 5th grade level.
 ​
 What are my options? I found this line in a website that gives me hope that I can apply for it easily or without too much restrictions or requirements.

                              <span>I live in a small town and every other Sunday they cut our power from 7AM to 5PM (but it&#x27;s almost guaranteed to be a few hours after). Today they didn&#x27;t turn the power back until 9PM. I am looking for a solution for power during those cuts. Many of my neighbors have generators. It&#x27;s a bit noisy and honestly I don&#x27;t like storing fuel in my house.
 I tried looking up for batteries. I am not installing solar panels, just batteries that are charged by electricity when available. &quot;Pin tích điện&quot; is the Vietnamese keyword I can use without being pointed to &quot;ắc quy&quot; or &quot;pin sạc&quot; (which won&#x27;t have enough wattage). Can you please recommend a good source? What is the general price for my requirements below? In the long run is it cheaper than a generator? Is there a reason most people just use generators that I am not aware of?
 We won&#x27;t be cooking but an aircon is required for at least 3-4 hours for our toddler (also one reason I prefer battery over generator is due to the noise). I would like to run a fan, watch TV or use my laptop if possible. There is a fridge, would be nice if I can keep it running but we always keep it cold the day before anyway so maybe running it for an hour only mid-day won&#x27;t hurt.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read a lot about people who&#x27;ve jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge (one of the world&#x27;s most frequent suicide locations) and one quote has stuck with me:
 Ken Baldwin jumped from the bridge many years ago, in 1985 (a two-hundred-foot fall that statistically leads to death 97% of the time), but the instant he did so, in midair, he was hit by a horrifying realization: &quot;I instantly realized that everything in my life that I&#x27;d thought was unfixable was in fact totally fixable - except for having just jumped.&quot;
 With that sudden desire to live, Baldwin managed to change his body posture just before impact so that he hit the water feet-first rather than head-first (which would have meant certain death.) Even hitting feet-first, the only possible survivable posture, he still suffered numerous, severe injuries to his body. But he did survive, and went on to tell the tale and live a transformed life.
 If you are ever suicidal, for whatever reason, please take his words to heart - whatever you may feel in your life is &quot;unfixable&quot;, may in fact be totally fixable or something that can be lived with. Don&#x27;t wait until you&#x27;re in mid-air after having leapt from a building or bridge to come to that realization.

                              <span>Yes…it was delivered on a scooter, and even setup in my home. As someone from Canada, I am utterly flabbergasted with the delivery method and delighted with the setup. All for a little less than the same TV in Canada. Insane. I love Vietnam. I tipped the delivery guy and he seemed surprised. Is this not common?

 Currently in Bali and have seen a lot of geckos everywhere - whats the situation in Vietnam, Danang? Should I expect the same amount of geckos there as well?
 Also heard that Vietnam has a lot of rats - is this true and how bad really is it?

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 I will be flying to Vietnam this week!! It&#x27;s been my dream ever since 2019 to film and capture the essence of this wonderful country. I want to know from you all, the local people about where I can go to capture Hanoi at its traditional and cultural best.
 1) What are some of the iconic monuments, markets, and places that are Hanoi exclusive?
 2) Which streets give away that Vietnamese essence right away? Where are the food stalls?
 3) What activities do Vietnamese/Hanoi people do in the morning? (Do they go fishing in some lake? Do they set up their morning stalls? If so, where? (Please help with the exact areas/locations) 
 4) What are some of the events that I need to attend? (I am gonna be there on December 28 and from December 30 - January 3. I know, it&#x27;s just 4 days but I am ambitious to capture as much as I can.)
 I know I can Google this but I am looking for recommendations from people who actually live in Vietnam. Appreciate it a whole lot if you can help with all the details! Thanks for your time! Let me know if you can join me for the morning/evening/late-night photography/film walks! Would love to connect and enjoy some cups of coffee together!

 I recently became a U.S. citizen and have a U.S. passport. I plan to travel to Vietnam next May for 40 days, so I want to use my Vietnamese passport (still valid until 2025) to enter Vietnam and avoid the visa requirement, but my name is different on the two passports (I changed my name). I&#x27;m unsure if I should book my roundtrip plane ticket in my old name (on Vietnamese passport) or new name (in U.S. passport)? Or should I just apply for 2 e-visas?
 Another thing is my mom wants me to renew my chứng minh nhân dân (identity card) too. Is it okay to use my Vietnamese name for that too?
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>If you are considering going from Saigon to Sapa by motorbike, then I hope this post will be helpful. I just completed the trip recently, and it was the best trip I have ever taken in my entire life. I did the trip solo on a 150cc Honda Winner X motorbike, and the journey was 4,108 kms in total. I was gone for 29 days (28 nights), and it cost me just over 30,000,000 VND for everything. 
 I really loved seeing how beautiful Vietnam is. My favorite cities were: Da Lat, Hoi An, Ninh Binh and Sapa. I stayed in 14 different cities throughout my trip, staying for 2 nights in each city as I made my way to the north of Vietnam. I was amazed at how diverse the landscapes were; one day you&#x27;re riding along the coastal beach line and the next you are winding through mountainous regions.

 I’m sorry if this question has been asked a lot but the situation in the other posts are a little different. So, thought I’d ask again.
 I was born in Australia. Both my parents were born in Vietnam. At the time of my birth, my dad was an Australian citizen (so I got Australian citizenship automatically) and my mum was a Vietnamese citizen. My mum has Australian citizenship now but she never gave up her VN citizenship (not sure if she automatically lost it).
 I currently have my mum’s birth certificate, national ID (CMND) from the 80s, and old VN passport from the 90s (expired). Would this be enough for me to apply for my first VN passport? Any other Australians went through the same process?
 Asking my mum to renew her passport is completely out of the question so I’d like to know if I can do this myself lol.
 I’ll call the consulate in Sydney some time but just wanted to hear from others first. 😊

                              <span>I have a US phone and phone number. Will I need a vietnamese number (from a vietnamese sim card) to be able to use the gojek/grab/Be apps? 
 I am travelling to VN for 30 days in January and wondering how I should go about it. I don&#x27;t think my phone is unlocked but I may be able to unlock it before I leave.
 Wondering if I should go VN Sim... eSim... or just pay for the international plan here in the US before leaving. Just want to make sure I will be able to use those apps for transportation.
 Thanks so much for any replies.

                              <span>Recently arrived from HCMC. So, the final is at a normal time after semis required a late night/morning stay-up-athon where you&#x27;d be happy with anywhere half decent open. What are the suggestions for locations for watching the final. Only requirements are Big clear screens and half decent atmosphere as well commentary in English. Prefer bigger places to small ones. Chance of rain is high so covered roofs is also of necessity.
 Thanks.

                              <span>My fiancé and I loved our Saigon trip last week! We both fell in love with Vietnam country and we have been thinking that we would love to move to Vietnam in the future once we get married. 🥰 
 So question, is it hard to move to Vietnam? We&#x27;d like to stay at least 1 year and a half? Any advices? We both live in a different country (yes, we are long distance for 3 years now). 
 Thank you everyone!

                              <span>Hi! I will visit Hanoi soon and I am curious which app to use to call a taxi. Can you give any recommendations? Maybe also recommendations for some specific local taxi companies to look for?
 Thanks!

                              <span>my partner is from Vietnam and moved to my country for school. his birthday is coming up and I want to cook him traditional Vietnamese food. Do you have any suggestions I could make? I live in Canada so certain ingredients are hard to find however there are two Asian supermarkets I can drive to. I like to think of myself as a good cook so I’m not worried about time/difficulty. I’m thinking something with a pork protein and a dessert

And the other day I choose to delete Facebook as was tired of fake people and not having any real or true friends. I do have a wife and dog. But I want to meet some normal people be friends with. That don&#x27;t only drink in fat shaggys or BÜl viên or people don&#x27;t do anything other than drink. I wanna make normal friends in Saigon. I&#x27;m 26 English male.

                              <span>Obviously there is no Sài Gòn Đỏ or 333 everywhere here. Budlight aka plain water is out of the question. I see my dad and uncles drink Stella which is from Belgium and also Heineken. Me personally I like 805 or Sapporo. Just wondering what&#x27;s other good options out there.

                              <span>Hi guys! I’m currently staying at an airbnb on Tranh Dinh Xu street and I have to catch a flight at 6am, I have been using grab bikes to navigate around Saigon and found them to be extremely convenient but I would prefer to use a car for my trip to the airport due to my heavy backpack, however I am concern about the availability of grab cars in these early hours etc 3-6 am. Does anybody know if it’s possible to get a car using grab or is there any other alternatives to travel to the airport. Any answer would be greatly appreciated! Thank you

                              <span>Never had or seen beef cheek meat before. Thought I could make some quick steak but when I cut it it was TOUGH. (Yes, I learned later from the recipe page that it&#x27;s tough because cows use that muscle often.)
 https://www.gourmettraveller.com.au/recipes/chefs-recipes/braised-beef-cheeks-in-sarsaparilla-7233
 Just noticed while typing this that the recipe is by a Vietnamese chef and TV personality in Australia. Daniel Hong. Famous enough to have his own page on Wikipedia.
 Too much work, and not enough time, so I opted to use the remaining of instant bo kho jar in the fridge instead. Into the Instant Pot, it went.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarsaparilla_(soft_drink)
 &quot;In Vietnam, sarsaparilla is one of the flavors (Xá Xị) sold under the Mirinda brand, bottled and distributed by Suntory-PepsiCo Vietnam Beverage (formerly, PepsiCo Vietnam).[22] There is also a sarsi flavored soda (Huong Xá Xị) under the Fanta brand.[23] There are two local brands offering their own sarsi drink:
 Sá Xị Chương Dương by Chuong Duong Beverages. Wonderfarm Zizy by Interfood Shareholding Company. 
 Sarsaparilla-flavored sodas are available in the south of Vietnam but much more difficult to find in the north. &quot;
 What&#x27;s your favorite brand of xá xị? Anyone know where I can them in U.S.? I wonder if xá xị drink is available. There are plenty of xá xị flavored drinks.

                              <span>Hello all! Be heading to visit VN soon in probably a few months and I&#x27;ll stay mainly in HCM and Nha Trang. I know Bank of America have no branches in VN. But what about other banks? It would be nice to know so I can open another account in order to withdraw money later over there. Thank you!

                              <span>I know this might be a stretch but there was a movie my grandmother used to play for me during my childhood. 
 It involved a child and his greedy father. There was a phoenix who flew both to grab goods from a nearby island (I think gold and starfruit) but the father grabbed too much gold and weighed the phoenix down while flying on its back. 
 The phoenix looked animatronic if this helps :(. I imagine there’s a ton of versions of this since it’s a popular folklore. Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning a 10-day trip to South Vietnam (gonna split North and South into two separate trips)
 What areas of South Vietnam are must-sees? Also, what are some good day trips from Ho Chi Min? I’ve heard 2-3 days in HCM is enough (unless the purpose of the visit is strictly eating delicious food) but I was thinking of using it as a base for day trips, heading out in the mornings and going back to the hotel to sleep. Any suggestions?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I only have two weeks and will be riding a motorcycle (have experience - 3000km in India, Pakistan, Ethiopia, etc.) and am looking to go around the northern parts of the country like Ninh Binh, Ha Giang, Sa Pa, and Hanoi. I am wondering if end of February is a good time to visit Sa Pa? Or the north in general.
 Or if anyone can offer alternatives or other advice I would appreciate it. Thanks!

                              <span>Looking for a nice/fancy dinner recommendation in Ho Chi Minh City for a Friday night that can host about 20 people. Going to be there in January for a bachelor party but we plan on doing a dinner with the two parent groups and their family. I believe we&#x27;re staying in District 1 but are open to traveling to the other districts for food.

                              <span>Question for the native Vietnamese of this sub, how do you feel about foreigners visiting your country?
 Do you differentiate between different foreigners or are we all &quot;white people&quot;?
 Also I would like to know where you are from in Vietnam, the country side or more from populous regions.

                              <span>My name in Viet ( I’m biracial, half Viet, half Australian) is Thảo, and is the name I normally go by. I’m not sure what it means.
 I’m told it’s after a flower, it’s a herbal, or it means to respectful to parents, courteous, or something like that.
 I still don’t know what it means. Can anyone tell me?

                              <span>I lived in Da Nang for a couple of years but since I was working I didn&#x27;t get the chance to travel all that much. I&#x27;ll be returning with my partner for the month of February and we&#x27;re wondering if there&#x27;s a unique/fun way to travel from Hanoi to Da Nang that involves seeing some sights along the way. Or, alternatively, if it&#x27;s worth just flying instead to cut the duration of the trip. We&#x27;d like to see Ninh Binh but my understanding is that we could do that in a day or two from Hanoi and then return and fly out to Da Nang. 
 Any insight appreciated! Thanks very much.

                              <span>Looking to go to Vietnam with my wife for 8 days early January. We&#x27;d like to stay somewhere luxe, ie, villa with private pool or apartment in 5star hotel. I think south would be better as it looks warmer at that time. Any recommendations?

                              <span>So, I reside in Thanh Xuan, and there is this Circle K on Vu Trong Phung. It’s at the intersection of the big Cay Da. I buy my coffee everyday on my way to work. And I order it with no ice, no sugar. Why?
 For a couple of reasons, it’s faster for the employees to make, and I like my coffee black. Anywho, the coffee only cost 12k. I noticed, that the first few times I had ordered my coffee, some of the clerks would fill it a little less than half of the cup. Now! That I have consistently go there everyday, I get the best coffee around town. O don’t even need to tell them my order, instead the clerk would automatically ask me, “black? No ice, no sugar?” I love it! Plus, this time comes around there’s this clerk that just doesn’t care about the amount he gives me. The dude fills it to the brink. Kudos to him! Let me know if this hack works for you.

                              <span>Hello all, I&#x27;ve been living in Vietnam for a while now, and this is something that&#x27;s started to grate on me a bit.
 Most of the vietnamese teachers that I have gone out to eat with, have invited to my house, sang karaoke with, and thought I&#x27;d gotten friendlier with, still call me just &quot;teacher&quot; even though I&#x27;ve long since told them they can just call me by my name unless in front of students in which case they can call me &quot;Teacher _____&quot;. I also always call them by their name or nickname, unless it&#x27;s someone I&#x27;m not that familiar with.
 ​
 It&#x27;s kind of like insisting on calling someone &quot;Doctor&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot; after they&#x27;ve already allowed you to call them by name, like they want to keep the relationship distant to less than acquaintances, which is fine if that&#x27;s what they want, I won&#x27;t have to join their drinking sessions anymore haha.
 ​
 Is this normal in vietnam? I have a vietnamese friend that says in their language they just call each other by name, but when I discuss it with the teachers they say they are just being &quot;polite&quot; in their culture. I even told them I prefer to be called by my name and they still say, &quot;hello Teacher.&quot;

                              <span>Hi, I am looking for a university in Vietnam that has a department with several researchers on Buddhism. Google didn&#x27;t really help. Any advise on what university might meet this criterion?

                              <span>Hi everyone, can we still see the train passing by at the Train Street in Hanoi? I can see some articles showing that tourists cannot visit the Train Street any more or it has been closed or something. If there is a local person, who can help with location from where I can sit and watch the train pass through narrow Street while sipping coffee?? Thanks in Advance

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m a dual citizen Vietnamese (not American), born and raised in HCMC for 18 years, left 6 years ago to go to college to get my BS/MS in Mechanical Engineering abroad in the US. After an internship with no sponsorship and my visa expired, I returned home (thanks to the impending recession my company refused to sponsor my visa or hire me)
 I have Vietnamese citizenship, ID card, passport, I can legally work here with no issue. My Vietnamese is &quot;so so&quot; at best, I can speak fairly well but reading and writing is another issue. My English is fluent, and I speak it with 0 accent thanks to my parents.
 I&#x27;m currently looking for a job but I was wondering how the process is like in Vietnam. In the US/other places I could easily search up Glassdoor/Linkedin, but here I&#x27;m a little more confu…</span>

 We aren&#x27;t that close, but she&#x27;s Vietnamese but now lives in the UK. I was drawn her for seceet Santa, so I&#x27;m looking for a gift for around £25.
 Does anyone have any ideas of something I may be able to get her from the UK? Posting here because I&#x27;d like it to be related to Vietnam, rather than just some generic gift

                              <span>I only have four days to visit Vietnam, so I can only visit one city and it has to be a city I can fly directly in to. I have never been to Vietnam at all in my life. So I have to choose to either fly in to, and visit, Hanoi or Ho Chi Minch City. Either one, or the other, but not both. Which one should I choose, and why?
 I am interested in seeing anything old and interesting (old buildings, temples, markets). If there is a mountain nearby I can go to that&#x27;s a plus. Nicer weather (this will be in February). Good eating (cheap street food?). Which of the two cities is cleaner, less crazy driving and/or street congestion (human).
 I&#x27;m not interested in bars, romance or shopping.

                              <span>my partner and I are traveling to vietnam next month and are sorting out our plans - one thing we’ve been considering is a motorbike tour (this 4 day tour from Dalat to HCMC in particular: https://www.easy-riders.net/tours/tours-from-dalat/442-easy-rider-dalat-to-saigon.html). Neither of us have a motorbike license or any experience with bikes so we’d have to ride pillion and it is a bit pricey ($400 USD).
 Has anyone done these types of tours before and is it worth it?? It seems like a really amazing way to see the country but we’re torn of whether if it’s the best use of time/money.

 Will I be charged extra for checking in suit case and carry on a laptop bag? Because that makes 2 baggage? 
 Has anyone flew Vietnam airlines before and can advise?

                              <span>Very excited to travel to Vietnam next month, but my partner has a shellfish allergy. We often travel with the health warning written in local language to make this as safe as possible… 
 Google translate offering is below, but would it be possible for a native speaker to check, confirm or amend? 
 Tôi bị dị ứng với động vật giáp xác có vỏ và sẽ bị phản ứng dị ứng nếu tôi ăn bất kỳ sản phẩm nào có tôm, tôm hùm, hàu, cua, v.v.

                              <span>My wife was born in Vietnam before the war and came as boat people to the US. She is a US citizen, but needs to get a copy of her Vietnamese birth certificate. 
 Tried calling and emailing all official Vietnamese embassy/consulates with no results. Nobody every picks up the phone, voicemail boxes are full and won’t accept messages. Emails to all public addresses haven’t been responded too. 
 Probably tried calling 50+ times throughout the last 3 weeks. Sent 15+ emails to the various consulates and the embassy.
 Absolutely no response from any officials. This is super frustrating…
 She has no living relatives in HCMC to help with the local authorities.
 Any suggestions on what else to try?

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to be visiting Hanoi and Ha Giang and was thinking about not packing any clothes, except for a few outfits, and instead having clothes made for me custom. How realistic is this, and how might I get it done?

                              <span>Hi! I‘m traveling to Hanoi at Christmas and want to do a brief Vietnamese course (German or English). I‘m searching for something that lasts about half a day to get familiar with the language in general, as I read that it is a vocal language. It would also be great to get in contact with locals and Vietnamese culture. Do you have some suggestions, please? :)

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 8 days ago, I began catching online predators in Vietnam. I have 3 catches already. Yesterday, I caught my first teacher. That didn&#x27;t take long. This guy was an English Teacher at an international school here in Vietnam. 
 He was immediately fired from his school, his apartment was contacted and they notified police immediately. He is losing his work permit. His embassy is aware of the situation. 
 It is very scary to think there are teachers out there trying to meet up with kids for pleasures. Thankfully, he met me instead of a kid and I reported ALL INFORMATION to proper authorities. 
 You can watch the catch on YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I will continue to do my part to protect the community and children in Vietnam. 
 I know some of you were skeptical about my original post when I said I was going to do this. 3 catches in 8 days is the results so far. Again, all evidence against each predator is always submitted to local authorities, employers, family members, embassies and whomever else may need it. That is all I can do on my end. 
 Much love to all of you! Thanks for your time. Will continue to update the community when new catches come out as you may know this person. Share, share, share and make others aware of these guys.

 I am from Germany and my girlfriend (24) moved to germany 3 years ago and this is our first christmas together. I wanted to surprise her with something from Vietnam, maybe something typical that I dont know about yet. Could you recommend something she would like or maybe remind her a bit of her home? 
 Any suggestion helps, Thank you!! :)

                              <span>Hey all,
 Over the past few years I&#x27;ve started reading around Chinese politics and have been intrigued by all the goings on in the CCCP. As my spouse is Vietnamese, I would be interested to read any English language resources that there are about the goings on inside the Vietnamese Communist party, whether it be books, websites or other formats.
 Does anyone have any preferred texts / suggestions?

                              <span>Hello,
 does anyone use an indoor camera in Vietnam. Which brand do you prefer? My In laws are getting older and I would like to be able to see them while I am away. I was hoping I could use the Nest Cam (indoor, wired) from the United States and install in my In-laws house in Ben Tre, but Google does not list Vietnam as being supported. 
 ​
 Thank you

 From the list we can see that China is an absolute behemoth. Russia generates more than Japan, let alone Germany.

I&#x27;ve been to VN twice (it&#x27;s one of my fave countries) but I would like to get your recos on travelling with a senior (She&#x27;s 62 but still active) and it&#x27;s her first time travelling outside the country. I&#x27;m thinking of heading to Hanoi, Sapa and Da Nang. Any recos would be appreciated. Thank you.

Meanwhile if I eat even a single slice of pepperoni pizza, I&#x27;ll gain 5 lbs and bloat like crazy. I don&#x27;t know what sort of dark magic crack there is in Vietnamese food but it&#x27;s always so much healthier than American food 😄 Not complaining, I love it!

                              <span>Just moved to the city last week. I&#x27;ve searched some water delivery companies but was wondering what the best option for getting drinking water for my apartment is. 
 We&#x27;ve been buying the 1.5 liter bottles, but would rather not have to go buy water bottles daily. 
 Thanks!

 We had no signs of pinworms but took it to be safe. 
 Should we be worried?

                              <span>All hotels and flights are already paid for. Just need cash to spend on food, activities, souvenirs, tips and taxi transport. I’ll be in HCMC/ Phu Quo/ Da Nang/ Phnom Penh/ Siem Reep &amp; Hanoi. Anyone think $1000 US is enough to have a good trip or is $1500 US more reasonable to spend ? Roughly 16 days in Vietnam and 5 nights in Cambodia. I want to be able to buy whatever I want/need without having to worry (ex. Go to fancy restaurants and order King Crab). For all I know, maybe $1500 US isn’t enough for the lifestyle I’m going for. First time traveller to Vietnam, any thoughts or tips would help :) and yes, I know that it’s best to bring crisp new $100 US bills + every hotel I’m staying at has breakfast included.

 But the places around me serve it pretty much the same. Are there any popular variations of the dish?

 I had a flat mole that suddenly I noticed that it became raised/bumpy. I would like to get it checked out to make sure it is not melanoma/cancer. 
 I think a dermatologist is what I would need to see but I don&#x27;t have anyone I can ask for help from. 
 Please recommend a dermatologist and if possible give me an idea of what to expect to pay. I need to make sure I have enough money. 
 Even if I go back to US now, I don&#x27;t think my insurance would pay for it.

                              <span>So at the airport HCMC, there are usually airport bag helper that helps carry your checked baggage and help you up to the check-in of your checked baggage and carry-on. They would ask for coffee money of 10 dollars per person after assistance. Is this legitimate? 
 Do they split the money with the airport officers guarding (they check to make sure you have a boarding pass/passport-not the ticket agent of the airline) the entry door of departure? Any experience with this?

                              <span>Hello beautiful community! I have been long time lurker and I joined this community because my in-laws are Vietnamese. I am going to vietnam for my honeymoon with my Vietnamese-american husband, it is his first time to Vietnam too and meeting his family. I am super excited and cant wait to visit Vietnam. We land in hanoi and we will visit his family in saigon and we will end our trip in phu quoc. Where is the best place to exchange money in hanoi? is the airport safe place to exchange money? What is conversation rate in Vietnam. I saw online is 1 USD to 23,000 dong. Is this correct?

                              <span>Hi, my wife got a job in Vietnam. We are moving there at the end of the month. I am trying to figure out how much money we will need to bring and how (cash, card, etc?).
 Does it make sense to exchange USD to VTN Dong is US and already come with Dong? Do we bring cash and try to exchange it instead? What is the best move? 
 As i understand, she will be able to open a bank account there once she has her work visa done. With that said, we will have substantial spending for first month and she won&#x27;t get paid until the end of the month (finding apartment, 2 months deposit plus first months rent, food, necessities etc). I am thinking we need to bring enough USD cash with us otherwise we will get destroyed with foreign exchange fees? I also read there are limits on daily withdrawals? Is it feasible to bring USD and exchange it at gold shops? Is there a limit how much they will exchange? What about airports?
 ​
 Any advice or ideas would be appreciated it.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello all! I apologize because I&#x27;m not Vietnamese, but my best friend is. She just finished a tough week of finals and is feeling a little homesick. She recently told me she wanted some steamed buns (basically Chinese Baozi). I was wondering if anyone from Northern Vietnam could share their or their moms recipes with me. I want to make a bun filling that makes her feel like she is home. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to Vietnam for a business trip and I wonder if there are places that play metal (not iron maiden and judas priest more like black, death metal that you think cats are giving birth in your basement type of metal) or other alternative genres like gothic rock, punk, post punk etc in Hanoi/Saigon. Live shows with local bands, too
 I will be around 3 weeks in each place (if that matters).
 Or even places where alternative people gather. I have an alternative look when I don&#x27;t work, and I feel more comfortable when I hang out with other local alternative people rather than strolling the cities idly in my gothic attire. Especially being an alternative woman, it can be kind of alienating.
 I don&#x27;t speak Vietnamese even though I&#x27;m trying to learn some basics in order to be able to communicate with local people if that matters too :P
 Thank you!

 Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone, there are a lot of people in need especially this time of year. I have a top box for my motorbike and go around Saigon once a week passing out waters and food. Every week, I try and go to a different district and look for those in need especially the kids who are working on the street corners just trying to help their families. 
 If anyone has a top box and lives in Saigon as well and wants to go out with me sometime it is truly a rewarding experience. The smiles and gratitude stick with you and make every day meaningful. Please reach out to me via messenger and maybe we can get a group going. I have been doing this for around 12 weeks straight and will continue to do it, but would be cool to get a little group going.

I highly recommend the motorbike tour from Hoi An to Hue on the Hai Van pass. Our driver was Mister T and he did a wonderful job.

                              <span>I met some young kids (3-8) during a trip north of Ha Giang that were blond. It was the first time I met a natural blond asian. Their older brothers/sisters had brown hair, not the usual dark one. Is it common there or is it recent ? (some blond foreigners genes from French/Americans maybe). I think these kids were Hmongs, did not have european traits (just Vietnamese with blond hair).

                              <span>Like tittle said, I want to stay in Vietnam longterm, but it seems like the easiest option is to marry a local. The government only allow expert visa (people who are highly skilled) to have a longterm residence card. So my question is, what is the best business to open around? Have already found a Vietnamese business partner I can trust, so I don&#x27;t mind if I don&#x27;t own the company on paper? Doesn&#x27;t need the business to thrive, just want it to run on itself so it can sponsor my business visa. 
 We are thinking about a coffee shop, but not sure this is the best option...

 but for non english speaking countries how does the translation goes? do they also translate from portuguese or should I bring my own.

                              <span>Hi! I’m wasian person mixed with viet. I started learning Vietnamese because I wanted to be able to speak to my dad’s side and also it is a beautiful language. I had learned through online resources the way you hi to people is “Xin chào” for formal and just “chào” for informal. I took Spanish the last two years of school and had learned to use “usted” to say “you” formally to people older than you or to higher-ups, so I assumed I would use “Xin chào” to greet my family. When my dad picks me up from school, I began to greet him with “Xin chào,” but recently he told me I would actually say “Con chào ba” to greet him or anyone else (pronouns changing depending on person). I was curious if that was a regional thing (my dad is from south vietnam but my bà nội is from north vietnam/south china) or if that’s a general thing among all vietnamese people?

 Does anyone know of any war memorials in Saigon that aren&#x27;t in museums. I&#x27;ve tried searching but have not found any results that don&#x27;t direct me to the War Remnants Museum. Is this on purpose?
 How do the residents of Saigon commemorate the war or is it a subject they much rather not discuss? (The Vietnamese war is something I have only recently found out about so please excuse my ignorance)
 Any help is greatly appreciated and if this is not the place to ask please direct me to the correct thread.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Will be in Da Nang during Tet and my friend who is living in Vietnam said that everything will be closed and be ready to buy some noodles beforehand so you would have something to eat. He lives in Hanoi though, so I was wondering if everything is closed in Da Nang also?
 If this is not the thing in Da Nang, then where could I get information on what is happening and when?

 I&#x27;m Canadian and my hubby is Vietnamese. We&#x27;re going back to Vietnam and its been so long. Particularly we are spending some time up North this time, our first stop is to land in Hanoi for a week.
 Can anyone recommend me and FOODIE hot spots? Ideally places local go - inexpensive, delicious foods not to miss out on. 
 I&#x27;m reading up on Bun Cha is pretty exclusive to Hanoi... also the dill fish noodles?
 Let&#x27;s go, lets chat Hanoi food!

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I just wanted to ask for some book recommendations for my Vietnamese mom. She basically does not read, just a typical Facebook mom haha. Her memory is getting a bit worse so I want her brain to keep sharp with a bit of reading.
 I was thinking some very easy read, maybe like some romance novel or any interesting thriller, action, drama. Those are at least the kind of movies I see her watching, so I think that genre would be good.
 Also I’m currently moving between Germany and Czech Republic, do you know what is the best way to even get books in Vietnamese? I was googling, but I always just get the translated version and not the Vietnamese:( 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all, apologies in advance as I’m writing this on my phone. 
 So I’m freaking out a little as I’ve booked seperate flights with a self transit to get back home from Cambodia with Cambodia Angkor air to Ho Chi Minh and then the final stretch with Vietnam airlines to Australia tomorrow and I didn’t realise that I might have needed an e-visa to collect my baggage and continue on with my journey. 
 Has anyone ever done this before or might know exactly what we can do in terms of getting a transit visa to get home? 
 I’m currently riding on getting my luggage as carry on and doing an online check in so there will be no need to actually go past the immigration area. 
 If anyone has any advice I’ll be really grateful. This is causing me a fair amount of stress.

My subjects (Business/Econ) are not part of their 12 core specializations, but is it possible? Do they have foreigner teachers? The website looks like it was made in the 90s so I haven&#x27;t been able to glean much info from there.
 Would love to hear anything you know about it!

                              <span>I use Duolingo, and I&#x27;ve picked up a (very little) bit from just living here ... I can buy food, deal with money, understand classroom commands etc. Obviously, I&#x27;m a teacher. I also generally can understand what topic people are talking about, but not what they&#x27;re saying, if that makes sense.
 My issue with Duolingo is that I like knowing what I&#x27;m learning, not just guessing. As in, I&#x27;d like to know the grammar rules and stuff. I know not everyone learns that way, but I quite like to learn theoretically! This will be my fourth language to learn, so I feel like I have an idea of how I best learn. (I am not fluent in my third, but have learnt enough to get by in simple situations, which is kind of what I&#x27;m aiming for here).
 I am thinking of asking one of the Vietnamese teachers I work with for a lesson once a week but my schedule doesn&#x27;t allow time for much more. Self study would be ideal for me, especially reading, grammar and vocab. I have lots of short pockets of time to kill between lessons. I have a handle on most of the tones, but that&#x27;s what I would focus on with an in person teacher (tones, pronunciation etc).
 Any resources to recommend? I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it :) 
 Cảm ơn bạn bè!

 Ok so I&#x27;m planning to visit my family in Saigon during this upcoming Tet. However, I got into an argument with my parents that if I wear any expensive jewelry in Vietnam, some gangsters would cut my hand off or snatch my gold chain. 
 They even told me that I shouldn&#x27;t visit an Internet Cafe in vietnam because thats where they sell opium to customers.
 Like what the actual fuck? Is this really true?

                              <span>If anyone has ever seen the show &quot;To Catch A Predator&quot; then you have an idea what this is about. Adults pose as children on the internet to find if adults still wish to meet them even after knowing the age. Often times, the age does not deter these people and they still come out to meet. Well, I launched the first ever group of its kind in Vietnam. Keeping the community safe and protecting kids is what it is all about.

 ​
 Tôi vừa trở về sau kỳ nghỉ ngắn ngày ở Việt Nam và ở đó cực kỳ yêu thích Nước tăng lực Sting, Rất khó để mua được loại nước uống này ở Úc, Vì vậy, tôi đang tìm người có thể mua Nước tăng lực Sting và gửi về Úc, Nếu quan tâm vui lòng gửi cho tôi chi phí bao nhiêu để gửi trên 20 lon trở lên số lượng bao nhiêu sẽ dễ dàng nhất và tôi sẽ liên lạc

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a tour or tour guide in Saigon that is interested in discussing the political history of VietNam and Ho Chi Minh from a socialist/communist perspective.
 I understand that looking for a tour like this in English might be unpopular/lacking because a lot of western opinions on these perspectives are neutral to negative, thus they probably don&#x27;t want to do these tours. I also feel that most tours and guides around the world play it very safe and conduct their tours in the most uncontroversial or unchallenging ways possible, which can be problematic for someone who wants to hear about a problematic or contested period of history. I&#x27;ve even been on a few tours in Central Europe (ahem Hungary) that went far the other way with very conservative nationalistic and revisionist recollections of historical moments, but I feel it&#x27;s difficult to find guides or tours with a collectivist mentality.
 Does anyone have any tours or guides they can recommend to me for January? Or am I thinking too hard about this, and maybe the average Vietnamese guide does feel this way and want to share about their country through this lens? I just don&#x27;t want a guide that gives me a Wikipedia summary of Saigon&#x27;s political/social history because they think it&#x27;s what I want to hear.
 Thank you

                              <span>Title says it all. I’m an experienced driver, driven over 20k kms in India, 2000 kms in Seychelles, 1500 kms in Thailand (Pattaya/Chiang Mai) but I don’t have an IDP, and never needed one before. Initially wanted to do a road trip from Saigon to Hanoi but dropped that now as I was quoted 85USD a day plus 450 USD extra for not dropping the car back in Saigon. Currently in Saigon till this weekend.

                              <span>I am curious how popular it is for girls to dye their hair in Vietnam and if the elders were to complain if the girls dye their hair brown, blonde, red, blue, pink, etc?
 In my family (all Vietnamese, living in the US), my 85 year old uncle (aunt&#x27;s husband) really hates hair dye to the point where if one of his family members dye their hair (ex. my cousin), he would yell at them. My cousin dyed her hair blonde and she ended up being scorned by him. He told her &quot;you look very ugly with the hair dye. Please un-dye the hair&quot;.
 His daughter had cancer and had to undergo chemo and because she lost her hair, she decided to buy a wig. I think she went with the black hair wig because if she went with blonde, her father would disown her.
 Also, for some of my cousins (part of the uncle and aunt&#x27;s side), they brainwash their children not to dye their hair. They say that not only does hair dye look ugly (even brown or blonde hair because one part is light and the other is dark), it causes cancer as well. According to them, if their children dye their hair, they will get grounded (maybe even spanked) and they might get disowned by the family because they are seen as &#x27;rebellious&#x27;.
 I definitely don&#x27;t view that way and I view hair dye as a person&#x27;s identity and personality.

 Main goal is to relax in the beach with less crowd. Which is the best from these two locations for a beach holiday and any recommendations on resorts?

                              <span>I am coming to Vietnam for 3 weeks in jan/feb - one week to travel and two weeks for a university subject. I have adhd and take dexamphetamine for this. I want to know if I can take my prescribed amount into the country in carry on? Does anyone have experience with this? Should I be asking for a script for some ritalin instead to take with me as it&#x27;s not an amphetamine? I just want to be safe and to have access to the medication that I need while I am studying over there.

                              <span>We are planning a Southeast Asia trip and wondering how the weather will be if we want to visit Hue, Da Nang, and Hoi An from about Dec 29th - Jan 6th? THe weather updates we find for the last and next weeks look very wet and we&#x27;ve found a video of flooded streets in Hoi An. I know it is Typhoon season in this area now, but is it expected to get any better by then? We would be planning to do outdoors activities like visiting temples and beaches and possibly snorkeling or scuba diving but none of them seem like good options if the weather is as bad as it is now.
 Would it be better to spend less time in this area and go to Mui Ne, Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta for 2 weeks instead of one? Maybe spend some time in Dalat?

                              <span>Visited 6 yrs ago and planning itineray. Wondering if I should plan things like Bui Vin st for weekend, in case it&#x27;s dead midweek. I don&#x27;t like to book excursions in advance, but should I? For example is it better to book a Ha Long bay cruise when i fly to Saigon? Or reserve in advance? I went with my wife last time and this time going with my parents, sister, and her husband. Are there a lot of options in typical tourist cities for 3 bedrooms or just book separate rooms? Not sure which would be cheaper and availability.

                              <span>We are currently traveling through Vietnam with our 5 year old and 4 month old baby (from UK).
 We have been to Hanoi, Ha Long, Ninh Binh and are currently in Phu Quoc and are really enjoying it so far. 
 We are due to go HCMC this weekend for 4 days and are worried that the weather in HCMC looks really hot for the kids (31c). They are ok in Phu Quoc but we are next to the sea in a resort.
 We were wondering what is the weather actually like in HCMC during the day and evening? Bearable or not?
 Also tips for stuff to do would be good taking the weather into account!
 Ps. Say hello if you see us. You wont miss us 😄

                              <span>Hello everyone, I came to Vietnam almost two months ago to work as an English teacher in Yen Bai province under the sponsorship of an English center. In the duration of my stay, the department of education in Yen Bai didn’t grant me the work permit because they were confused about my BA which is a degree in English Language Teaching. Therefore, I’ve started looking for a job in Hanoi but my visa is about to expire. 
 During one of my interviews, an employer told me that I had to do a visa run because I don’t have a work permit. Is this correct or are there any ways that the employer may not know about? If it is correct, what is the cheapest way to do a visa run? I’ve done research about it and found some information but if there is anyone here who knows about this stuff or has had a personal experience like this, I would like to hear from them cause I’m in a dire situation. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

                              <span>In 2024, I am thinking of going to Vietnam for the first time since the pandemic began (I might go to Vietnam in 2023, but I have to see my itinerary as my parents might instead come to visit the US, so I might not need to go to Vietnam, and plus, I am taking Summer 2023 to go to Europe, so I might not have time to go to Vietnam).
 As for transportation, since public transportation is quite limited in HCMC compared to places like Boston, NYC, Washington DC, San Francisco, Europe, Moscow (used to live/study in Moscow before moving to the US, so I know the public transit situation in Russia), etc, I think I might either rent a car or use a motorcycle to get around.
 Since I typically don&#x27;t use taxicabs when I was in Vietnam when I was young, instead, parents drove me around Vietnam in their car, I don&#x27;t know how much taxis between HCMC and Binh Duong cost (my mother&#x27;s siblings live in Binh Duong by the way), so I think I might either rent a car or a motorbike.
 In Vietnam (my home country and country of birth), I am planning to be there for around 2 weeks, and from what I have seen on Kayak, Google, etc, there are not so many traditional rental providers in HCMC Vietnam (eg. Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, etc). With that said, since I wanted to go around HCMC, go to Binh Duong, and maybe go to Nha Trang and back (I am planning to go there by myself), should I buy a motorbike or should I rent a car?
 I am also curious about road conditions in Vietnam if they are any good or not (things change a lot in three years as Vietnam is quickly developing) and plus, are trains/buses any good or should I just stick with the motorbike and the car?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I’ve lived in Vietnam 6+ years and have had many Vietnamese teachers, but I’ve finally found one I really enjoy learning from. 
 I used to learn from her in person in Vietnam but now I just learn on zoom. 
 I recommended her to another person here on Reddit who just gave me feedback about how great she is so I thought I’d try to get her a few more students by advertising here. I get nothing from this except I just want to support her. 
 She makes custom lessons depending on what you want to learn and you’re learning style. She’s an actual teacher in Vietnam but luckily she teaches Vietnamese to foreigners (or viet kieu) with more of a western style … if you know what I mean 😂
 I think she charges about 14-16 dollars per hour. 
 Please send me a message for her contact info. Thanks

 i don&#x27;t see the problem of my country being communist is a bad thing. 
 But i see in here alot of American or people live in developed country really didn&#x27;t not like Communist country.
 what i had seen is we are not restricted to anything. and we are really free to do anything. 
 i think i am being biased because i don&#x27;t know much about hte large scale impact of How communist part impact normal people like me. Since i don&#x27;t know any better.
 What are you guys observance on what Vietnamese are restricted to under Communist Party?

                              <span>In short I&#x27;ll be in Vietnam for a month and am looking to keep up my fitness. Guessing the humidity&#x27;s gonna be tough to adjust to at first so I&#x27;ll start off aiming for 5km runs (at a slower pace than usual) and see how I go from there. 
 Any suggestions are welcome. Looking to avoid crowds and traffic where possible so my image is that (for example) a trail run or a loop around a big park/lake would be ideal. 
 Open to tips on hydration and prep as well (including some food that&#x27;s gonna go down well as I&#x27;m not a massive fan of Vietnamese cuisine outside ban xeo, a simple pho (no &#x27;special&#x27; ingredients), banh hoi and fresh fruit/veg. 
 I&#x27;ve never run in Vietnam but I&#x27;ve run during Japanese summers and am picturing something pretty similar in terms of humidity (i.e. I had to do shorter distances at slower speeds otherwise I&#x27;d get exhausted/dehydrated really quickly). Looking forward to adding a few solid Vietnamese runs to my Strava and (hopefully) improving my conditioning through this. Don&#x27;t wanna use the humidity as an excuse to get fat/lazy.

                              <span>According to the news, he went to a house in D2 because his friend texted him about somebodyhaving a heart attack inside a complex building. 
 JMG got stopped by an elderly man (acting as the security guard of the building), he tried to explain to the guard that he is a doctor and there&#x27;s a person dying inside. The guard didn&#x27;t let him go inside because this is a private property, not a complex building. JMG was very agitated at this refusal so the guard tried to keep his distance, JMG chased the guard down and scrub him by the neck like an animal, push him back to the house, pote tially smack him a couple of time and tell him to open the door. A local man then came out and explain to JMG in English that he is the owner of this building, there&#x27;s no other person inside and he is making a big mistake. 
 JMG friends arrived and admit they gave him the wrong address then rush inside another house to save a dying man. The police arrived at the scene later and JMG was very uncooperative, refuse to admit that he was assaulting an elderly man and insult them. 
 Now JMG is running a public relation campaign, trying to pay the press about how his actions are just, that everything he did was trying to save a man from heart attack, and he just a bit strong handed with the guard.

                              <span>Hi guys! I&#x27;ll finally be visiting your country this week. I&#x27;m quite excited for that. I am planning to travel light from my home country and pack heavy on the way back. One of the things I want to do is shop for clothes, accessories and things of the like. Can someone tell me what are good places in Hanoi to go shopping. Places where I can find original or authentic products and high quality products at discounted prices. Any such shopping hubs in the city ?
 Thanks in advance guys!

                              <span>As stated above im looking for most likely a chinese TV series.
 I dont remember the plot but i was maybe in the 1920s. The actors were dressed in suits and fedoras and equiped with handguns. Cound be something towards mafia,crime war or even japanese occupation.
 The opening or ending song was something similar to &quot;Bella Ciao&quot; 
 Chinese version on YT: Bella ciao
 It always aired everyday at 10pm or even later
 Take my description with a grain of salt because some of it could be straight up bullshit
 Thanks in advance

 How is the weather going to be if I was to do the motorcycle loop for about 5 days?
 I have heard conflicting reports on weather, and rain levels. I have 1000&#x27;s of hours of motorcycling experience all over the world.
 Thoughts?? Thanks!!

                              <span>Hi again to this great, responsive community! 
 I&#x27;m writing to see if anyone can recommend a bakery that makes colorful/detailed cakes (this one is for a birthday, but any beautiful cakes are welcome) in Saigon?
 I saw some pictures elsewhere of dragon cakes, and others responding that cakes with zodiac characters are popular in Vietnam, but these types of bakeries and cakes don&#x27;t show up when I try to search for them. I&#x27;m not really interested in European/western flavors or designs or characters, I hope to find something generally like this. 
 I can&#x27;t speak Vietnamese so phone communication might be difficult, but of you know any such bakeries with an email address, I can surely translate a request and send it on to them. Thanks for any recommendations you may have!
 Edit: I did see that someone wrote bakeries like Givral may have something like this, but I didn&#x27;t see options on their website so I wonder if such cakes just aren&#x27;t posted online?

                              <span>I booked a flat in Saigon very last minute. The host messaged me on booking.com asking to transfer the payment via bank transfer. First of all, do we have any rights if the accomodation is a scam or the rooms are bait-and-switch? I am guessing not. Second, I can&#x27;t seem to be able to reach the booking.com customer service. All the time the response comes from the host. Third, the system didn&#x27;t take my card details, but cancellation is not possible(well, you can cancel but at a cost of the reservation)
 Not sure if this is the norm in Vietnam or some sort of scam/bait and switch operation??

                              <span>Hi! My partner and I are in Vietnam for the first time and have some questions about Ha Long Bay if anyone could please advise? 
  
Firstly, as someone who can feel seasick on rough water am I likely to feel ill on a cruise, especially overnight? Or are the waters so still that boats are barely rocking? 
 
Secondly, we are trying to decide between Ha Long Bay or Lan Ha Bay. Which would you recommend for a first timer? Seems like Ha Long Bay is a little more spectacular and can walk inside caves but super duper touristy, Lan Ha Bay slightly less touristy but a little less grand? Or is it just worth it to go to both?
 
Is it worth it to stay on Cat Ba? It seems like we&#x27;d have a slightly less hectic experience if we spent a couple of days on Cat Ba and did some hiking or kayaking, is it worth going to? 
 
Is there easy to access and regular public transport from the North of Cat Ba where the ferry drops off to the South where hotels are? Apparently there are buses and taxis bit not sure how easy they are to get or how regular.
 
 Thanks for any help! :)

                              <span>Hello! I’m wondering if inside shoes are a thing in Vietnam? Does the average Vietnamese person have a pair of footwear they wear inside / are only allowed to wear only inside? I know most people just take their shoes off inside and have bare feet, but is the use of an inside pair of shoes a common thing in Vietnam, or is that just a tourist thing for hostels? Thank you! 🇻🇳

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 My partner is Vietnamese and we met and live in Australia (I&#x27;m not from Australia myself). We were talking about starting a family and always planned on staying in Australia for this as we have our jobs, home and social community here. This year we&#x27;ve been going back and forth between Vietnam quite a bit because we knew we wouldn&#x27;t travel much after having a baby. Now my partner found out she&#x27;s pregnant while in Vietnam. Now she decided to stay here in Vietnam as she can get better care here - (yet she is constantly sick here while she isn&#x27;t when in Australia). 
 Every time we are in Vietnam her mother flies down to stay with us, her brother lives near too, every time I want to take care of things my partner tells her brother or mother will do it because they&#x27;re Vietnamese …</span>

We found a very busy one in HCMC but they went through our AUD and picked out different notes and gave a different rate on the different notes. 
 What is going on here? Isn’t it all the same?

 Is this true? Should I postpone my travel? I&#x27;ll be be traveling to Da Nang Sapa Hanoi Ninh Binh.
 Also, I hear that train street is closed for tourist, so can we atleast go and have coffee at the shops or it&#x27;s completely closed?
 Any suggestions and tips will be helpful.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi guys. Me and my husband are traveling to Ho Chi Minh City 16th of Jan 2023, were we will spend 3 days before flying to Phu Quoc 20th and staying there for 11 days. We are mostly traveling to Vietnam for the food, culture and to just enjoy the weather and the beaches. I have 3 questions. 1. Should we be worried that tet starts 22nd of Jan, if we want to visit local restaurants and museums in Ho Chi Minh City? 2. Do you have any recommendations for authentic Vietnamese food in any of those places? 3. What are some must see places in Phu Quoc?

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m part of a team that is building a new crypto wallet app. Our aim is to make crypto simple to use. We previously built a consumer app that scaled to 500million+ users so we have good experience building for mainstream consumers. 
 We just opened up a waitlist to onboard early users as beta testers at getcode.com
 Our goal is to get 10 people from every country on the waitlist. There&#x27;s a good early Vietnamese community growing so I wanted to post here and see if others might be interested. You can sign up directly at getcode.com and feel free to send me a message as well if you have any thoughts/questions. 
 Would love to get you on Code when we start rolling out and get your feedback.

Bây giờ mình đã về Việt Nam sinh sống nhưng niềm đam mê đó vẫn còn rất nhiều. Mình đã cố thử tìm group và page trên fb về người Việt đam mê bộ môn này nhưng chỉ tìm đc 2 trang(1trang đã chết và trang còn lại củng ko còn đăng bài cả 2-3 tháng nay dù cho trang đó chỉ có 1-2 bình luận mỗi bài…). Mình nghĩ tìm trên fb đã khó thì chắc reddit càng khó hơn. Hy vọng có thể tìm đc ai đó có thể chia sẻ đam mê này của mình…

                              <span>Hi everybody, I&#x27;ll be visiting Vietnam shortly and staying with a Vietnamese family in Hanoi. I have a large luggage allocation and not much to take so was wandering what kind of gifts would be appreciated in Vietnam. The family have 3 children with ages ranging between 7 and 13.
 What kind of items are &#x27;special&#x27; or sought after in Vietnam?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hi, I am half vietnamese but have lived in Europe all my life, don&#x27;t speak the language and I am not too knowledgeable about local customs. I am on a visit in Vietnam after a very long time (last time I was here was when I was a small kid). Basically, I am visiting all my close and not so close relatives and most of my aunties and uncles are giving me money as a gift. What is the etiquette in Vietnam about accepting/refusing such gifts? I really appreciate their love and I am thankful they want to gift me money, but I don&#x27;t really need money. For me it&#x27;s enough that I can meet them and spend time with them after such a long time. They all come from wealthier backgrounds so they are gifting me large amounts of money (in the range of hundreds of dollars basically), I would prefer to refuse the money - is that acceptable in Vietnam or is it a taboo and I have to accept the money gifts? Thank you

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;ll be visiting Vietnam soon (HCMC) and I&#x27;ve been stuck down a little knowledge rabbithole and curious to learn more about Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s life and legacy in the region. Other than the obvious HCMC History Museum, his memorial monument, War Remnants museum/Cu Chi Tunnels, are there any other historical resources/places/tours or historian tour guides around the city that I could include to learn more about Ho and his place in history? Interested in him, Vietnam&#x27;s communist past and It&#x27;s current hybrid political structure, reunification, etc. Thanks.

 Any suggestions? I saw few places that are spa massages but I am looking more for a place with sauna, pool etc rather than only massage and not too expensive

                              <span>Hi everyone ! I will be coming to Vietnam (HCMC) soon and was wondering if you guys had any advice for my first time using grab bike. I&#x27;ve never ridden on a motorcycle before, but this seems to be the most efficient mode of transport in Vietnam.
 Or would any of you recommend the public buses in HCMC? I&#x27;ve checked Google maps, and the places I want to visit are only about 3-4 stops away from my accommodation.

 I brought VND and USD as back up but ended up not needing to exchange any USD and tonight is my last night.
 Now, I want to gift them USD cash but I don’t want to make seem like pity money. I don’t know if they are poor or “ok”. 
 Am I overthinking or is it OK to gift money since everyone knows foreign money goes a long way?

 Also if you know of any cute home goods stores, I&#x27;d appreciate these rec&#x27;s too :)

 I read the comments I thought it was friendly phrase used by Vietnamese that see Laos as friends/brothers but then I looked it up only and some source I found makes it sound more of a derogatory term to lower class Vietnamese. So what does Đông Lào really mean?
 Side note: Thai use the phrase West Vietnam, Lao-Kaew or Lao-Dang to Lao people as a derogatory term for those who are mixed with Viet or those embrace Lao-Viet brotherhood. Many Thai believe the Lao government is a puppet to Vietnam. And that the Lao government teaches their people to hate Thai and love Viet more. The truth is Thai has done more damage to the people of Lao for centuries. Link below if you want to read about Thai-Lao history

Does anyone have any recommendations of rock/metal style vietnamese bands? Sure it might not be the best for trying to pickup the words but it&#x27;s what I like! Haha Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I have just arrived in Saigon and would like to rent a scooter for a short period, around 5-10 days. Recommended places I see are usually for long term, or one way rentals (DC, Tigit). Anyone know a place that is more suited for a short term?
 Would like something like an Airblade if possible, I really enjoyed riding them last time I was here in Vietnam.

I opened it just recently and untangled the ‘strings’. It’s harder and a lot saltier than I expected. Is there a specific way this is usually eaten other than just eating it on its own?

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 I currently have booked a tour of Hang En 2D/1N with Oxalis adventures for around $300. I was thinking of booking something with Jungle Boss tours of Elephant cave and Ma Da Valley where we would hike and swim through caves in one day ($65). Side note: I&#x27;m planning on doing a motorbike tour after that will bring me from Phong Nha to Khe Sahn to Hue and then to Da Nang/Hoi An over 3 days (~$210). 
 The Hang En tour is the most expensive thing I&#x27;m doing on my trip so I&#x27;m trying to figure out whether I can get a very similar experience by seeing a different cave. I&#x27;ve never really explored any caves so I&#x27;m not sure what to expect.

                              <span>Hello I used to use the app called Zalo for years now but an incident occured where my old phone is gone so I got a new one with a new number, I created a new account with the new phone number and everything was fine, till I added a coworker of mine and sent them a message then all of the sudden my account was locked and asked to provide documentation to verify which is fair enough, I use my passport (which isn&#x27;t from Vietnam which is from the Philippines) and it just doesn&#x27;t work. 
 How can I resolve this? I really need this app for my work.

                              <span>In Hanoi for 3 days and was wondering where the best place to buy a Thuoc Lao (Dieu Cay? Sorry not sure what the name of the pipe is) and an Opium Pipe would be? I collect smoking Paraphenalia and these two would be great to add to the collection. Preferably a Thuoc Lao with nice engravings or traditional art on it. In regards to the Opium pipe just anything beautiful that isn&#x27;t a rush job/souvenir. Not sure if I&#x27;d like to take something vintage away from the country but any help is appreciated.
 Thanks you

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 Any suggestions on whether I should stay in Da Nang or Hoi An? It seems like there is no consensus on Hoi An, some people say it should only be a day trip and other people wish they had spent more time there. I have a mid-budget and care most about trying great food, having unique accommodations, beautiful scenery, and being able to go on cool day tours. I&#x27;m not interested in shopping so Hoi An does not sound very appealing. I fly out of Da Nang which is why I thought it would make sense to stay there and make a day trip to Hoi An. It also seems like similar tours are offered from each location. 
 My rough itinerary is as follows: Hanoi - 2 nights; Ha Long Bay - 2D/1night then bus to Ninh Binh - 1 night, overnight bus to Phong Nha - 4 nights then train to Hue - 1 night; then easy rider to Da Nang/Hoi An - 2 nights.

                              <span>I try to have conversations with vietnamese people via chat, while still learning vietnamese right now. I am mostly able to understand them, but still have some struggles. To name a few examples, which I coudn&#x27;t find answers for:
  
How do I agree with someone in an informal way and not sound too formal, especially to people who I refer to as &quot;em&quot;? Is &quot;Dạ&quot; and &quot;Vâng&quot; too formal? While &quot;Ừ&quot; or &quot;À&quot; kinda seems too inappropriate and informal.
 
What does &quot;nek&quot; and &quot;nè&quot; mean? I read somewhere that these are the same, but I still don&#x27;t really know what they exactly mean.
 
What is the difference between &quot;nha&quot; and &quot;nhé&quot;?
 
What is the difference between &quot;rùi&quot; and &quot;rồi&quot;
 
Is &quot;á&quot;, &quot;ợ&quot;, &quot;ah&quot; at the end of the sentence the same as &quot;ạ&quot;? Why not just use &quot;ạ&quot; if it is the case.
 
I&#x27;d like to know more shortforms which are very common in chatting. It would be great if you guys could name me some.
 
 My goal is to become more natural and fluent in vietnamese. Hope someone can help. Thanks in advance. :)

                              <span>Basically the headline. Do you know anybody who is visiting Munich from vietnam within the next months? If so, would this Person maybe be willing to bring back a certain brand of cigarettes (Camel Black Tea)? They are of high sentimental value to me and this person would absolutely make my day/month/even year. Payment could be arranged through your preferred method. Thanks in advance

                              <span>I have been in Vietnam for two weeks. I pay cash most of the time but I prefer to pay with card for big expenses to don&#x27;t pay the fees when I use an ATM. I paid with card in supermarkets for small stuff, like 10k for a bottle of water, and this has never been a problem.
 I gave been told today by my hotel that I&#x27;ll be charged a 3% fee to use my card (big hotel chain, the bill is 1.8M). 
 Is this legal and common?I am pretty sure that in my country it would be considered illegal.

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 Long story short, I was put up for adoption to live a better life in America when I was 2 (mistake child, have 2 biological brothers 10+ years older than me). I grew up in a great family in the states, but I’ve always wanted to go find my biological family. Right before COVID I traveled to Vietnam for 30 days to try and find my family. I found them after a few days and lived with them for the remainder of my time there and I’ve gotten very close to them these past couple years.
 I am going to visit them here soon for Tet and want to give them money and gifts. How much money should I give them (enough to be generous, but not enough for them to rely on me)? And what gifts should I bring? My two brothers have 2 kids each and they are all mid-teens, so I bought each family laptops for school / college. I was thinking candy? I had a bunch of candy that I had brought last time and the kids loved it. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I was looking up the differences between north and southern accents, and I found a post where someone said that no is không/hông in north/south, but I can’t find anything else referencing this
 But I’ve also heard hông biết used for “I don’t know” and a YT video explained using that for “I don’t know”
 So I’m basically asking is hông ever used (outside of hông biết) ? Is it just an alternative pronunciation of không?

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I&#x27;m somewhat pretty interested on the conflict called the Vietnam War, I watched/read quite a few things about it and I used to live in HCMC. The documentary of Ken Burns was super interesting but to me it lacks of the Vietnamese people&#x27;s experience at the time. If you have some ressources to share about it (even in Vietnamese language) I would be grateful :)
 The conflict with the french is interesting too, if you have anything about it please send it my way. Peace.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning to go to Vietnam in December and was wondering if its worth doing the Ha Giang loop late December. I am from Canada but still would like the trip to be enjoyable so not sure if it&#x27;s worth checking out at that time. 
 Has anyone here done it in December?

                              <span>So I was born and raised in vietnam and lived there for 11 years until I moved to US. When I was there I didn’t mind the heat as much but I noticed my relative sweating bucket when they came back to visit. Now that I lived in US for majority of my life and finally decide to come back, I figured I’m gonna struggle from the heat, so what can I do about it? 
 Also what is the best place in vietnam with the best weather? One of my destination is Hoi An for a wedding but I’m open to suggestion for more places as I haven’t really planned the trip out yet.

I tried closing the windows, but it seems that they&#x27;ve already laid eggs in my house. Recently, I&#x27;ve found more and more little flies and other weird bugs near the kitchen and the trash can. How to get rid of them once and for all? Traps and poison are also good, but I think some of the insects have evolved, the cockroaches wouldn&#x27;t fall for the classic Japanese capsule poison anymore help

 In my country, we have two very popular games called &quot;thumb war&quot; and another one called &quot;rock, paper, scissors.&quot; These games are easy to play and don&#x27;t require any materials, and they are so much fun. I was wondering if people in Vietnam are familiar with these two fun games, and how common they are. If not, what are some other popular games people in Vietnam like to play? I am looking forward to learning more about some exciting and fun Vietnamese games that are very popular

 A lot of Vietnamese (here on Reddit) hate Vietnamese Americans because we are anti-communist and accuse us as traitors. While Vietnamese Americans accuse Vietnamese in Vietnam as brainwash idiots.
 However, if we lived in each other shoes, we would probably do the same thing that each side accuses each other off doing. 
 If you lived through the war and saw your people murder and torture by the communist government regardless if you are from Northern or Southern Vietnam, you would not be pro-communist. Similarity, if all you learned in school was the Vietnam War (American War) from the perspective of the winner (North Vietnam), then your view will be in favor of the current regime. 
 Our views, experiences, attitudes, behaviors are shaped base on the context of our lives and those of our families. 
 But one thing that we can agree on is that we want Vietnam to become a develop country.

                              <span>Hello from a clueless foreigner!
 I am trying to figure out whether Bằng Tốt Nghiệp Trung Học Phổ Thông (which I understand to mean secondary school certificate of graduation) would qualify someone for admission to universities in other countries, like the US or Canada. In other words, is Bằng Tốt Nghiệp Trung Học Phổ Thông equivalent to a high school diploma? Or do students from Vietnam have to do a gap year before they can attend university abroad? I&#x27;m getting vague/conflicting info when searching it.

 Heading to Vietnam next month and looking to do an all day/overnight cruise experience. The options are overwhelming and most posts in this sub were outdated so looking for refreshed recommendations on what cruise line or location is preferable. Thanks so much in advance!

                              <span>Help, the Vietnamese Embassy in Canada is on Covid-19 hours and available for mail ins only. Meaning I cannot reach anybody by phone or email. Have been trying in fact since the summer.
 Now however they have received my documents as of yesterday, but have not charged my bank yet for their legalization and translation fees.
 Would really like some confirmation on cost and expected processing times until I have the documents in my possession again.
 Planning to visit VN this December beginning on the 19th, but prices for airfare are only going up.
 Need some information so I can continue planning my trip.
 Anyone know how to reach someone at the Vietnam Embassy here in Canada?

                              <span>Chào các bạn!
 I am a 21yo &amp; half vietnamese, half european (french &amp; italian). I both have vietnamese and european features (&amp; nationalities). I principally lived in France, and I did not learn vietnamese when I was younger, I knew a little from previous trips. I am currently Việt Nam for 3 months by myself (it&#x27;s been more than 2 months now) and I am speaking a lot better, can hold conversation. Somehow, most of the people here see me as a foreigner. When I approach them (bằng tiếng việt) they stare at me &amp; hit me with the &quot;tây ạ?&quot; and ask me why I can speak vietnamese. I have to explain myself pretty much every time to anyone speaking to me, &amp; also not to have the tourist prices haha. Also every time I go to the countryside, everyone stares at me like &amp; talk about me like I don&#x27;t understand them lol.
 ​
 It hurts me as I always considered myself vietnamese, as I lived with my việt kiều mom most of my life and growing up w vietnamese culture, I feel very vietnamese to put it simple haha. It starts to make me feel a bit sad, &amp; even sometimes I feel wrong not to look viet enough &amp; don&#x27;t feel like I belong to this community. Everybody in France can tell I am asian from my features, but here I am a foreigner to them.
 ​
 Do you have any tips on how to approach this situation? Does anybody have been through the same experience? I think it would make me feel better to know that I am not alone in this. 
 ​
 Cảm ơn mngười! :)

                              <span>I just started to travel in your country and I love it so far ! But why the buses are the fastest vehicule on the road here? They drove like they were in Formula 1. I still can&#x27;t belive all bus driver drive that fast in road with so many curves and no good sight in front of them (even during the night) Help me to understand :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m staying for 3 months, originally rented a place already. When I arrived, everything was not as advertised and/or broken and the landlord hangs up on me. I need to find a new place to stay soon.
 I am looking for a place with 2 rooms, already furnished, kitchen, wifi, and a/c. 
 I see that the posts here usually say to look on facebook but can someone recommend me some groups? 
 As for district, probably 5,8,10? but I am open to other districts as well.
 Has anyone rented a place similar to what I am looking for? What does it usually cost? Please give me an idea of what to expect in cost to rent!
 I&#x27;ve asked around and see that a lot of places only allow you to rent if you plan to stay for 6 + months. I would rather have it month by month since I don&#x27;t want to run into the same issue I am having now with my current place.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Because Vinfast is popular in Vietnam with the Vinfast Fadil being one of the best sellers in the past three years, do you think Vinfast would be popular towards Vietnamese Americans, given the fact there are many Vietnamese Americans who are anti-communist (like many of my mother&#x27;s relatives who live in the US)?
 Also, I am curious if Vietnamese Americans are willing to buy a Vinfast or would they choose another car (like a Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Volvo, Porsche, VW, Polestar, GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, etc)? For me, even though I was born in Vietnam and currently live in the US (my parents still live in Vietnam however), I am not thinking of getting a Vinfast as there are many EVs which offer better value for the money, in my opinion (like Hyundai Ioniq 5, where there is a better brand cachet).

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I am friend with a girl who was born in Vietnam. She came in Europe when she was very very young and she doesn&#x27;t know nothing of Vietnamese language. Her name is &quot;Thai Ha&quot;. We searched the meaning of her name but without any result.
 Is it a popular name in Vietnam? What does it mean?

Is it mental I find myself wanting to read about Vietnam? Just would like to know if you guys think 22% is an insignificant amount?

                              <span>Hello. For years I&#x27;ve been using a Garmin 66i for my hiking across Europe and North America. I recently started travelling to Vietnam for work, spending weeks at a time there (4 trips this year already, 82 days in country total - just since August). I brought my 66i and I&#x27;ve been doing hikes with some of the locals on the weekends. It&#x27;s been amazing. However, I&#x27;ve come to find that my Garmin has almost no detail about any of the areas I hike in. No trails, no contour, no roads. Many times it is blank. It&#x27;s fine for tracking where I go, should I need to find my way out, but it&#x27;s a pain to try and plan or navigate some of our hikes when I can&#x27;t really see what is out there.
 I checked Garmin&#x27;s website and there&#x27;s no maps to purchase. There seems to be third parties selling SE-Asia maps but I can&#x27;t really get a read on how trustworthy they are.
 Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations? I&#x27;m heading back out in a few weeks for a 6 week trip, one week of which we&#x27;ll be going deep into the woods in northern Vietnam for 4 nights 5 days hiking and exploring caves. I&#x27;d like to have my garmin properly giving me information.

 We&#x27;re visiting Vietnam during the second week of December. We&#x27;ll be going directly to Tuan Chau harbour from the Airport. We are five of us and prefer to have a taxi ? Any idea where we can book it from and how much it would cost ? The cruise company is charging us 180 USD for one time transfer which seems quite excessive
 Can you&#x27;ll recommend any options ?

                              <span>I’m 24 and grew up having my parents and relatives speak to me in Vietnamese but I would always respond in English. I would say I know very elementary statements but don’t know much about the grammar or past/future tenses. So assume I know little to no Vietnamese to begin with. And now I’m visiting Vietnam at the end of the year and want to be able to carry small conversations with relatives, restaurant/store workers, etc. does anyone have any tips on learning basic conversational vocabulary and pronunciation?

                              <span>Hi, had a guide take me and my partner on a private tour to the tunnels and to the Mekong. It was a full day private tour from HCM. 
 I don’t want to cause any offence and want to tip him and the driver. (I’m on the way back now) 
 Is for example 500000 Dong the right amount / too much / too little? 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi, I am planning to visit Vietnam soon, and it occurred to me that New Years Eve is approaching soon, and I was wondering if this is a good time to visit Vietnam.
 I am interested in meeting local people, not so much interested in simply partying and getting plastered with other expats/tourists. Are the local people of Vietnam keen on hanging out for NYE celebrations? Or is the lunar new year more popular of a holiday in VN?
 Also, what are some good ways to meet people and learn about the people and culture in VN? From what I&#x27;ve read, if you look like a foreigner (I am 190cm white guy from America lol) people will talk to you if they see you eating by yourself and are generally quite friendly. Is this true? I&#x27;d love to meet people and feel warm and welcome, unlike when I went to Australia and it felt almost the same as America--super lonely and hard to meet people.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve learned other language pretty fast like Spanish by watching shows, what&#x27;s a vietnamese show/shows that talk or dubbed in Vietnamese? Youtube channel or Seinfeld/Friends etc where I know all the words and Acts, English so it&#x27;s 2nd nature for me when I hear it in a foreign language and can interpret it in my head.
 Currently using some apps to learn too but it&#x27;s more enjoyable to watch a show and learn the language

                              <span>Dear all, 
 I have lived and worked in Vietnam for the last 5 years. But recently I have been denied entry to Vietnam and I don&#x27;t know why. I left Vietnam to get a TRC which requires foreigners to leave Vietnam and come back on a business visa in order to obtain a TRC. However I have been denied by Hanoi immigration due to a &#x27;immigration violation&#x27;. 
 I still do not know exactly what the problem is and how to fix it! I am more than happy to pay a fine. I have tried many times to call and email Hanoi immigration but still no reply. I even visited Vietnam embassy in Thailand and London but they couldn&#x27;t help. 
 Is there anyone that can help me or give me a contact with someone that works in VN immigration so I can speak to them directly and fix this problem. 
 I have wasted a lot of money and time on agents who take my money under many promises but then do not help at all!
 I am a British citizen and currently living in London. I appreciate any help and kind of desperate as I have all my clothes, my jobs, my apartment, everything still in Saigon :( 
 Thank you all

I want to get a suit and I hear Ho Chi Minh is the place to do it, As I fly out of Ho Chi Minh on the 6th of December, I figure my best shot is to get fitted and order it as soon as I arrive tomorrow.
 Can anyone give me any tips or recommendations on places to get it done?! Would be very helpful.

 What is a good area to stay?
 Which app is best for taxis? In Thailand I use Bolt and In Driver, can I use those?

 I appreciate any tips you all have. Thank you!

 Moving to Saigon in February and want to carry on kickboxing or start muay thai etc.
 All of the gyms I have found online, the prices are pretty crazy. I understand I&#x27;ll probably find inflated prices but to pay 200 - 300 dollars a month is quite a shock haha.
 Does anyone have any recommendations of mma/ muay Thai/ kickboxing gyms that are not expat traps?
 Again, Im not expecting to pay local prices.
 Any help is appreciated 🙏

                              <span>I usually fly to Vietnam between June and August, so I always knew what to pack in terms of clothing. This time I’m flying in February and now I’m not really sure how to prepare because my cousins said that it’ll be really really cold but on the internet they said it’ll be alright. Should I pack some additional hoodies?
 I’ll be in Hanoi/ Ha long the whole month

                              <span>Hi Everyone!
 I’m off to Vietnam for 5 weeks in December
 I’m looking for some recommendations for gyms to train in. I enjoy powerlifting so would like to squat, deadlift and bench whilst I’m out there
 I’m travelling to the following locations:
 Hanoi Ninh Bing Hoi An Nha Trang Ho Chi Minh
 Thanks!

 ​
 Have I been scammed ? And even if I have been scammed, are my postcards going to arrive at their destination ? Thank you in advance for your answers ! https://ibb.co/grHDSFW

I grew up with my white parent and rarely see my Vietnamese family due to distance so my Vietnamese is essentially nonexistent. I believe my family is from southern Vietnam since I know there are dialects and stuff. Where should I start?

                              <span>Hi,
 What are best alternatives to Amazon in Vietnam? I&#x27;ve heard of Lazada and Shopee but not used either.
 I have a couple items I need such as a 3D printer and fish pond filter that are hard to find in shops
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I’m dating a Vietnamese girl and her grandfather just passed away. He has been ill for some time and doctors have even said he didn’t have much time, so it’s not really a surprise. Still, it’s obviously quite devastating to her and I’m trying to help her out somehow.
 I’m looking for ways to comfort and/or help her somehow. Maybe there’s something Vietnamese I can say. Any help would be appreciated.

 I’m looking for a new language to learn and it would be great to interact with them.
 Also, besides Vietnamese and English, is Chinese the next most spoken in Saigon? Or is there a different language I should learn instead of Mandarin/Cantonese?
 Thanks I’m advance!

                              <span>My (VN) wife and I (67yo American) will spend two days in Ha Giang soon. We want to rent a motorbike for two days to drive around, but not do the full loop. We live in Vietnam. I normally drive an electric motorbike and don&#x27;t have a motorbike license. I have a TRC. I&#x27;ve learned that one of the leading motorbike rental shops (QT Motorbikes) will rent a motorbike to me, but they require that I leave my passport with them. I don&#x27;t like doing that. (Also, I might need my passport at a hotel or if the police stop us.) I&#x27;m looking for recommendations for a motorbike rental in Ha Giang that will rent a semi-automatic bike to me for two days without requiring my passport as a deposit. Thanks
 Edit: Would welcome hotel recommendations in Ha Giang and places to see within a few hours&#x27; motorbike ride, too.

                              <span>Hey! I&#x27;m from England, I&#x27;m 19. 
 My university has offered a trip to Vietnam for a month because our university collaborates with a university (BUV) in Vietnam, Hanoi and I need to do some volunteering work and such.
 Expenses such as Flights and accommodation are covered which is nice and is why I took the offer. I have never been outside of Europe and have no real idea what to expect. 
 I&#x27;m eager to have this new experience and see a completely different culture and hopefully meet some nice people :)
 What should I expect? And any tips?
 Thank you :)

 I&#x27;m doing an essay on reasons for Vietnam&#x27;s bad education or sociology (esp. higher education) can you guys help list numbers of reasons as to why this has happened?
 Found this discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/xezgk1/whats_your_opinion_on_vietnams_education_system/
 but would love to hear from y&#x27;all.

                              <span>My wife and I have tickets to be in Saigon from January 23 to February 1. Since that week is Tết, we heard it may be a bad time to go because a majority of the city will be closed due to the Holiday week ( similar to the US and Christmas Day).
 Does anyone know for sure what it’s like during the week of Tết? My wife and I were just hoping to enjoy some of the local scene such as (and especially) eating at all the street foods, local markets, some sight seeing, etc.
 Thank you!

 One of my favorite places for live music, a variety of food and beer was the Benthanh Street Food Market.
 What are similar venues to this that are still open?

Basically I know someone who is visiting and enjoys reading about the history, ideally I&#x27;d find a book they can read as they travel to give them context on each place they go to, especially about the wartime.

                              <span>Tried to find some data online and struggled to find what I was looking for. Perhaps because the resource may be in Vietnamese?
 I’m curious about the wealth distribution by age in Vietnam. Been in Vietnam for a few weeks now. I’ve noticed a lot of people in their late 20s/30s wear nicer/designer clothes and tend to have fancier bikes than those older than 40. Although, I also know people that are younger may tend to care about these visual indicators of wealth more.
 Vietnam is a rapidly modernizing country, so I’d assume people born in the late 80s/90s have had better career opportunity? Curious about people’s perspective here. Assuming that the fallouts of the wars with America and China took some time to economically recover from.

                              <span>First time I booked them. Actually booked AA but the carrier was JAL. I thought JAL had a decent reputation.
 Other than some super efficient and sweet stewardesses this was not a good experience. 
  
Tried to upgrade to an emergency aisle seat for 100$. At first the very nice Caucasian worker said ok. But after checking with the Japanese JAL rep they said no. Only Japanese citizens can book it. Huh????? Can you imagine if AA said only Americans can book certain seats?
 
Inflight entertainment really blew. The movie selection was like a scarce selection of movies one might find at a rummage sale. They did have one James Bond movie. I ended up watching that and Shawshank Redemption for the umpteenth time. The hardware interface had such lag you never knew if a button press actually worked. Had to restart a few times. I know it&#x27;s a lot to ask but nowadays a selection of podcasts is pretty common. Also, and this is in general, why can&#x27;t airlines offer live newsfeeds? JAL had a day old BBC International segment and one Japanese language news segment.
 
I sat economy. The seat was particularly torturous even for economy. It was hard and small. I spent the last 6 hours of the flight rotating my position trying to find new unused parts of my ass that would give me ten minutes of relief. I&#x27;m a medium size guy.
 
The food was typical airline food in this case limited to Japanese cuisine That was ok by me but I thought I&#x27;d mention it. I had two legs on this flight: BOS to NRT (14 hrs) and NRT to SGN,( 6 hrs).Both flights had the exact same menu. I just skipped meal service completely on the second flight. 
 
 Maybe my experience was a one-off. Anyone want to share?
 Thanks.

 I am learning Việt and I believe watching series (with subtitles for now) could help a lot. I would prefer Spy x Family as the first one but if there are other alternatives I would be fine with them too. Cảm ơn!

                              <span>My dad is in Vietnam. I want to buy him one of those nice massage chairs for Christmas. And I saw some of these online stores where you can buy stuff in Vietnam and they will ship it to the address.
 Site like: https://www.ubuy.vn/en/brand/massage-chair
 or Alibaba.com
 Does anyone have any experience buying Massage chairs from these sites?

                              <span>Lost my ATM card. (already froze it)
 Spoke to my bank and it would be at least a week to get a replacement ATM card. 
 My bank said that I could go to a bank in Vietnam and provide my account information and they would be able to withdraw cash from my account.
 Has anyone done this in HCMC and what banks would you recommend/avoid?

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 I am currently visiting Vietnam and really enjoy the country, culture and cuisine! Therefore I want to buy some nice chopsticks as a souvenir for home that reminds me of this country whenever I try to replicate one of the delicious dishes.
 But so far I could only find some on the night markets and they don&#x27;t look good or of good quality to be honest. I am looking for a nice design, wooden and local/handmade would be a nice addition. Currently I am in Hanoi and will be leaving soon. Googeling brought me to these of Hanoi Desing Center ( http://hanoidesigncentre.com/product/570-wooden-chopsticks-m17). But unfortunately the shop doesn&#x27;t seem to exist anymore, I checked the location and they don&#x27;t reply on Facebook.
 Do you know any stories where I can get something like this? I would really like to find some nice ones. Thank you!

                              <span>I know there are is inheritance law that theoretically allowes spouse certain rights. But does anyone know in practicality what happens to your property, home, car, ect, as a foreigner when a Vietnamese spouse dies.
 Ive occasionally heard different stories about the spouse inheriting or having to sell to get the value and even the local family being awarded the property. But I never heard in practicality what happens in this situation. 
 Or what is best to do before hand to simplify the inheritance procedure.

 ​
 I will be bringing these U.S. dollars oversea by cash physically. I am aware we have to report more than 5000 dollars at the custom at VN airport. It will be more than 5000 dollars. I heard something about 30 percent tax on the amount carried that are declared?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m going to Vietnam for the first time next week and I&#x27;m wondering if anybody knows any specific places I can exchange USD for Dong in district 3? I&#x27;ve read that jewellery stores give you the best rate but does anybody have any specific spots in D3 so I don&#x27;t have to travel too far with my cash? 
 Also I plan on getting a VN sim, if I call around to some stores to ask what their exchange rate is would they understand English? I don&#x27;t know any Vietnamese outside of random food menu items lol

                              <span>So i&#x27;m moving to Vietnam in a couple weeks to teach English for the first time. I want to live in District 3 or Binh Tanh but the language centres I&#x27;ve been offered are all around a 20 minute drive from these places. So it looks like ima have to rent/buy a motorbike/scooter. I currently don&#x27;t have a license but I&#x27;ve read you can ride a 50cc scooter without one. How easy/doable would it be to rent a 50cc motorbike for a 40 minute round-trip each day?
 After I&#x27;ve settled in a little, I&#x27;ll probably work on getting a license.
 In the meantime, does anyone know of any other ways to get about the city that wouldn&#x27;t be as expensive as getting a taxi every day?
 Cheers

                              <span>I heard someone recommended Vietnam discovery esim. Is this a viable option compare to obtaining a sim at the airport?
 I’m spending 30 days in Vietnam and don’t really mind the cost as such but I want something that will work the entire duration, not something that will work 1 day and shit bricks the following. If you got a sim at the airport, which kiosk did you go to? 
 I went back in April and had no issues with grabbing a random kiosk seller sim but seem like a lot of people are reporting issues of reliable sim at the airport lately.

                              <span>Hey guys, so I’m visiting Ho Chi Minh for a couple of days this weekend as part of a longer Vietnam trip, thinking of checking out Saigon skate shop to get a board and was wondering if there are any skaters here who know a good place to skate near the centre? 
 I googled Ho Chi Minh skate park and there seems to be one but it’s pretty far away apparently! So just wondering if there’s any closer street spot that won’t bother people too much. Cheers!

                              <span>Hello, I’m an American on a business trip to Vietnam. Even though I have only been here for a week. I don’t want to leave. I feel a deep sense of peace here that I don’t feel in my country.
 I love American, don’t get me wrong. I feel as if people in Vietnam are more genuine and kind. I don’t think I’ve smiled as often at home. 
 I’m sure this is coming from a place of privilege. But I have a deep feeling of belonging here. I’m sure I will be back for business. But I wish I could stay.

                              <span>Just wanted another opinion on this as I want to be safe.
 Me and my partner are interested in doing the Ha Giang loop in a few days. My partner has been driving all over southeast Asia with me on the back for the past several months with no issues. However, we&#x27;ve only ever driven an automatic and we&#x27;re a bit nervous as I saw a couple posts on here that said a semi automatic or manual was needed to do the loop. We messaged the scooter rental we rented from before when we did the Hai Van pass to ask them about the loop and they told us it was safe to do the loop on a 125cc automatic scooter with two people on it. We wanted something a bit bigger if we could do it on an automatic but they don&#x27;t have anything over 125cc.
 Just wondering from people who have done it recently, especially with all the construction I&#x27;ve read about, if they felt that would be adequate. If not, maybe we might get a lesson on the semi automatic when we get to Ha Giang and see how comfortable we feel on it before deciding what to do? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>My wife is Vietnamese and lives in Da Nang. She wants a platform to sell her products and has been considering opening a market stall in Hoi An (night market). Does anyone know how difficult this is or if it’s even possible? I don’t think it’s as simple as turning up with a stall? I imagine if it’s “first come first served” the locals would not be very happy about you beating them to it. I would think there’s some regulation and rent to be paid though? 
 She is looking into it but was hoping someone here might know something about it!

 Can be popular or not, translated to other languages or not. 
 many thanks!

                              <span>Hi. First time going to Vietnam in a few days. I have heard people saying that a lot of beds in Vietnam are really hard, is this true? I have a pretty sensitive back so just wondering if the hotels&#x27; beds will be the same as beds in people&#x27;s houses? If so, is it likely that I can find hotels with softer beds for foreigners or be able to check what kind of beds each hotel has before I book?

 The Ha Giang Loop is an iconic ride through Northern Vietnam. Stunning mountain passes, delicious food, and chilly weather are certainly the highlights of the trip. 
 It&#x27;s absolutely on the tourist circuit, however. Be prepared to pass swarms of tourists, both domestic and foreign, on small scooters. Nearly every guest house in the towns you stop at will be full and, most likely, will have a party going on. 
 Overall, an excellent ride that I&#x27;d highly recommend.

                              <span>I&#x27;m leaving the country in a bit and i got two almost new motorbike helmets that i won&#x27;t be taking with me. One is a nice full face helmet.

                              <span>Not sure if this is the place for this. But I’m doing a solo trip to Vietnam for 3 weeks in December (9th to 29th). If anyone else is in a similar position and wants to meet up, let me know. I’m not a creep, just a normal woman in her early 30s, and thought it might be cool to meet some fellow redditors!

                              <span>I need some recommendations of fome coffee equipment. I currently own a Timemore C2 grinder, Aeropress go, Hario french press, some phin filter &amp; a cheap shopee scale (but the timer couldn&#x27;t work anymore). I am listing them so you can have a good gauge of my budget vs quality.
 I am thinking of getting a gooseneck kettle, a new scale &amp; V60. 
 1) Gooseneck Kettle: I am not sure if I should get a temp controlled one at this point. But I want a small one. Not those 1L and above. Looking at Hario or time more
 2) V60: Plastic, ceramic vs copper?
 3) Just get a cheap one from amazon? Is it worth to get so expensive. whats the diff?
 What brands and model should I be looking at?

                              <span>A female dress up as her friend&#x27;s dad and interrogate and slightly harass (a lot harass) the boyfriend (who has glasses). In the beginning, she was eating a sandwich. By the end, the mustache fell off her face, and funnily she takes the mustache and stick it between her brows like a unibrow and also onto his face. At one point, to show masculinity she pulls her pants up all gungho and declared &#x27;I AM MAN!&#x27; in English. The boyfriend was so nervous that he was trembling so much to the point that he shook off the couch and fell onto the floor. She was later revealed to be female.

                              <span>So I saw this (love) song maybe a few years back and can&#x27;t find it. The singer or the person it was focusing on is a female with red hair, actual blood-red or rose-red hair. The world is about to end with astroids or meteors hitting Earth. The female goes about her day while everything is in chaos around. At one point she was at the gas station getting gas and at a store getting groceries while everyone around her is panicking. By the end of the music video, she is eating a (romantic) dinner with someone (maybe not human) while a meteor is about to hit the earth.

                              <span>I’m a 25 year old male from Ireland. I’m looking at moving to VietNam, probably Ho Chi Minh city but I’m open to other options.
 One concern is dating, how does dating in VietNam differ to western societies?
 Is dating a foreigner seen as taboo or is it acceptable?
 Is there anything I should be conscious of?

 I have a 30-minute tech presentation which needs to be translated for 500 people in real-time. 
 You don&#x27;t have to know tech. The jargon will remain same in any language.

 Một người bạn cùng quê tôi tên là Ben đã qua đời vào sáng ngày 5/11 tại Quận 8, TP.HCM. Gia đình anh ấy đang vô cùng hoang mang và em gái anh ấy - Amanda đang cố hết sức để tìm ra sự thật anh ấy đã gặp phải chuyện gì. Tôi đăng bài này thay mặt cô ấy.
 Mọi người nói Ben đã rơi từ tầng 3 của một tòa nhà ở Quận 8 sau khi đi chơi đêm về nhà vào khoảng 5 giờ sáng. Chủ tòa nhà và công an khu vực vẫn chưa cung cấp thêm thông tin gì cho Amanda. Cô ấy thậm chí còn không có địa chỉ chính xác của toà nhà và căn hộ đó.
 Quê của Ben ở đảo Portland nằm ở phía Tây Nam Vư…</span>

                              <span>Hello, first time in Vietnam and I&#x27;m trying to use BusMap to get from my Hotel to Walking Street ( Phố đi bộ ). Yesterday I was waiting for bus &quot;route 152&quot; at (Route 152 (backward) First Station Sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất .. Bến Thành — Khu dân cur Trung Son Pickup for every 12-18 minutes). I was waiting for over 1 hour and I see the bus &quot;152&quot; passed me 4 times and never stopped to pick me up. I&#x27;m confused how to use the app because I&#x27;m following the directions the app tells me. Should I walk to the other bus stop further down the road? Please help!
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all, I am American, learning Vietnamese for a couple months now. This weekend I was at a temple and as we were leaving I went to grab my shoes from the shelf but an older lady was in front so I said “xin lỗi bà...” She turned around and said some things I did not understand, but from her tone I’m pretty sure they weren’t very happy. 
 Did I insult her?? Is there something different I should have said?? Not sure if this is the right place for this question but everyone here is very nice so figured I’d give it a shot. 
 Cảm ơn các bạn!

                              <span>I’m going to Saigon for a short work trip soon and I was just wondering if mobile wallets such as Alipay, WeChat Pay, and GrabPay are now widely accepted in the city? What’s the most popular e-wallet in VN right now and can foreigners sign-up to avail the service? Planning to use a mobile wallet (either GrabPay or Alipay) mainly for paying goods in malls and restaurants just to get by for less than 3 days in the city and I feel like I don’t necessarily need to withdraw cold, hard cash in DONG since I’ll be staying in my hotel anyway working most of the time.

                              <span>Chào mọi người!! Recently on TikTok, you see a lot of people talk about their travels overseas and eating the same, if not more, but still losing weight. Or vice versa, with exchange/international students, moving to the States and gaining so much weight. I’m wondering if the same could be said about Vietnam about the food quality, I know there’s a lot of processed food in every country but Vietnam is high on the list of countries with the healthiest diets! Does anyone have similar experiences with weight fluctuations while traveling between Vietnam and the States? I’m moving there soon and I’m really curious!

                              <span>I will be traveling to Vietnam to celebrate New Year. I am really looking forward to experiencing the beauty of Vietnam and relish all the things that I have heard about it.
 I have a query regarding a travel route from Ho Chi Minh City to Krong Siem Reap. My preference is towards traveling by road as I have been told it&#x27;s very economical compared to the flight. Along with that, I wish to know how comfortable that journey is and would you recommend it to someone who is traveling there for the first time.
 Looking forward for your helpful and insightful responses. I surely believe that I will have many more queries and I have utmost faith in the fact that most of them will be solved through this subreddit.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m looking for a cover of an old Vietnamese Magazine &quot;Chinh Luan&quot; from 1972. It would have been published sometime between May and August 1972 and features a Soldier standing on top of a tank on the cover. The magazine cover format is similar to this :https://nhacxua.vn/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chinh-luan.jpg 
 It features a family member of mine so I would happily pay a high price for a good quality scan of this cover or even more for the magazine itself or both. I&#x27;m not sure where to start, but wanted to reach out on Reddit in case anyone might know or even have this copy of the magazine. Thanks!

                              <span>I am active on a sub that avoid Chinese products. Often the alternatives are made in Vietnam which I am happy to support the local. However a few people say Vietnamese made products are no better, usually citing (without sources) that Vietnam uses low-wage workers as well.
 Now unfortunately I am quite unaware of the living condition of Vietnamese workers. Would you say Vietnamese workers are generally better? I know it&#x27;s not the best job but would you say it&#x27;s good enough? Sometimes there&#x27;s even absurd claim like slavery worker but I do not believe it happens in Vietnam (at least legally/endorsed). Would you say Vietnamese made products are more ethical? How would you respond to the above criticism?

                              <span>Hi friends,
 I&#x27;m planning a trip next year to Vietnam. I would love to do the entire country (North: ha Giang Loop, Sapa, Halong Bay, Hanoi,...) (Central: Hue, Hoi An, phone Nha ke Bang nationale park,...) (South: Ho Chi Minh) With all the different season I was wondering what is a good month/time to do them all? Ive read march/april is ok if doing them all. 
 What do you guys recommend?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all, my parents were born in Vietnam in the 1930s/40s and we came to the USA as refugees (my dad served in the south Vietnamese army). We&#x27;re all American (naturalized) citizens now and I don&#x27;t think we have our Vietnamese citizenships (my parents currently live in Vietnam and they had to get a visa to do so). I&#x27;m handling some (American) paperwork for my parents and unfortunately they&#x27;ve requested a copy of my parents&#x27; birth certificates which we don&#x27;t have. What would be the easiest way of getting this?
 From looking around online it sounds like my parents would have to get one from a Vietnamese embassy/consulate but it&#x27;s a weird situation because they&#x27;re not Vietnamese citizens anymore. My parents have US passports for reference.

I really found amazing how Hanoi has a lot of physical and consistent activities for the youngsters. It made me wish we have something as lively as this in my country. So yeah, I want to play basketball or tennis too! But I&#x27;m afraid if the tennants are allowed to use them too?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Coming April I wanna take a motorbike and travel through Vietnam for about 3 weeks. I have my European motorcycle license, so I&#x27;m fairly confident on the bike.
 I&#x27;ve always wanted to do a tour between Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, mainly riding through the mainland. However, after doing some research I get a lot of sources saying the north of Hanoi is the place to be.
 On one hand I&#x27;d love to get as much a vibe of Vietnam as possible, which seems the Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi would provide best. On the other hands, if the best sites are in the north, then I can totally be convinced to go there.
 Is there anyone who could give me some advice on this?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi all, apologies for using English and the google translation below. 
 ​
 I LOVE FOOD!!! One of the most exciting parts of coming to Vietnam for me is learning about the culture and food that Vietnamese people are so beautifully famous for. 
 ​
 My problem(?) is that I have had gastric sleeve surgery so I can&#x27;t eat much. Generally in Australia, my husband and I order one meal to share, but if I want something he can&#x27;t eat or doesn&#x27;t like, I will order my own meal and take the leftovers home to reheat later. That&#x27;s going to be a little hard when I&#x27;m trying to eat as many different type of Vietnamese food as possible.
 ​
 Would it be offensive or &quot;bad&quot; for me to order a whole meal for myself and leave a lot of leftovers? I&#x27;d love for us to order 2 different Pho&#x27;s and get to experience both but would it be a bad thing if we didn&#x27;t eat it all? 
 Any tips on how to explain/apologise for my limited eating capacity will be well received!!!! PLEASE! 
 Google translate below:
 Xin chào tất cả, xin lỗi vì sử dụng tiếng Anh và bản dịch google bên dưới.
 ​
 TÔI YÊU THỰC PHẨM!!! Một trong những phần thú vị nhất khi đến Việt Nam đối với tôi là tìm hiểu về văn hóa và ẩm thực mà người Việt Nam vốn nổi tiếng xinh đẹp.
 ​
 Vấn đề của tôi (?) là tôi đã phẫu thuật dạ dày nên tôi không thể ăn nhiều. Thông thường ở Úc, vợ chồng tôi gọi một suất ăn để chia nhau, nhưng nếu tôi muốn món gì mà anh ấy không ăn được hoặc không thích, tôi sẽ gọi suất ăn của mình và mang phần thừa về nhà hâm nóng lại sau. Điều đó sẽ hơi khó khăn khi tôi cố gắng ăn càng nhiều loại thức ăn Việt Nam càng tốt.
 ​
 Gọi nguyên một suất ăn cho mình mà để lại nhiều thức ăn thừa thì có phản cảm hay “xấu” không? Tôi rất muốn chúng ta gọi 2 phở khác nhau và được trải nghiệm cả hai nhưng không ăn hết có phải là một điều tồi tệ không?
 Mọi lời khuyên về cách giải thích/xin lỗi về khả năng ăn uống hạn chế của tôi sẽ được đón nhận!!!! LÀM ƠN!
