                              <span>I’m going to vietnam in a few weeks and my group booked Hong En cave tour. Rabies vaccines cost $1000 in my area. I’m considering to skip it since the tour website didn’t require rabies vaccines. for people who have done this cave tour before, do you recommend to get rabies vaccines?

                              <span>I&#x27;m from the US, and I&#x27;m contemplating a vacation to Saigon D8. I am on a very strict /r/carnivore diet due to an autoimmune condition, and I mostly eat only beef, butter and eggs. Occasionally seafood. I eat around 1 lb of meat per day, sometimes a little more.
 ​
 How difficult will it be to maintain my strict diet while in Saigon? I usually cook at home, but will probably have to eat out while there.
 ​
 When I&#x27;m desperate in the US, I can even go to McDonalds and eat the meat patties without the bun or lettuce, sauce, etc. Is the meat at McDonald&#x27;s comparable to the US meat patties in quantity &amp; quality?
 ​
 Thanks for your input &amp; advice.

                              <span>Hey all. I&#x27;m going to be in Vietnam for a while but I&#x27;ll still be working US hours. So it would currently be from 9PM to 5AM. I was wondering if anyone has been in the same situation and how did you manage?
 Is it easy to get food at night and in the early morning? Would it be more beneficial for me to sleep right after work or to sleep before work given a typical vietnamese day? Anything else I should keep in mind while there?
 Thanks

                              <span>10 years ago, I would say maybe 10% of Vietnamese are fat. Now I would think it&#x27;s about 40%. Maybe it&#x27;s all the American fast food restaurants opening in Vietnam.

                              <span>My husband and I are travelling to Vietnam in 2 weeks time starting in Hanoi and travelling south to HCMC stopping via Hue and Hoi An over the course of 2 weeks. We booked to go this time of year as we thought it was the best compromise of temperature/ being dry. Getting excited I checked the weather forecast earlier today and was a bit disheartened to see that it looks rainier than I was expecting. 
 I would love to hear from anyone in any of those places at the moment what the weather&#x27;s really like and if I should maybe re-think what I was planning and packing a few more waterproofs 😅
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;m a European, I work full remote and I&#x27;m in Japan now. It&#x27;s pretty cold here so I&#x27;m planning a 10-12 days work holiday trip to Vietnam soon, end of February beginning of march probably, looking for some spring like weather.
 I&#x27;ve read a couple of posts where people tend to lean Hanoi rather than Ho Chi Minh as a tourist destination but I am not sure. I would be fine with either. I understand Hanoi si less vibrant, more traditional, which is ok. I&#x27;m not looking for nightlife as I will be working. I don&#x27;t want to exclude Ho Chi Minh though.
 It would be my first visit to Vietnam and I&#x27;m pretty excited. My concern is the weather, as I read that Hanoi tends to be colder? I&#x27;m leaving Japan for that reason, so I don&#x27;t want to find myself in the same situation.
 Also, I would like to work with my laptop around the city and enjoy the famous Vietnamese coffee culture. Is it safe? I&#x27;m used to Japan where pickpocketing is not a thing and I read some posts here pointing out that snatching phones is rather common. Is that true? I would be screwed without my computer. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, 
 I will be in Vietnam for 3 weeks in April. I still need some equipment and I noticed that some products I am interested in are &quot;Made in Vietnam&quot;. 
 Now I was wondering if I can buy these products cheaper in Vietnam/Hanoi than in Germany? 
 I am specifically interested in some products of the outdoor company &quot;Patagonia&quot;.
 Thanks for the help

                              <span>Hi folks!
 I will be visiting Hanoi for 6d5n in April, spending 2days on a cruise in Ha Long Bay.
 It&#x27;s our first time to Hanoi, and my parents&#x27; first time in Vietnam.
 If anyone has recommendations on eateries, interesting places to visit, or tips on navigating the city and would be so kind to share, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>The continued economic turmoil there got me wondering about this. If there was civil unrest that threatened the Laos government, what would happen if China sent troops in under the guise of supporting the government or protecting their investments.? Given Laos has be a defacto puppet of Vietnam for much of it&#x27;s existence and and there&#x27;s always been rumours of VN troops supporting the government even in recent times against the Hmong and in the past against Thailand, would there be a response? I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Vietnam at least considers Laos a part of it&#x27;s sphere of influence, and while China would presumably prefer to continue to buy influence as they&#x27;re currently doing in Laos and Cambodia, civil unrest could change things. Not saying it&#x27;s likely, just wondering what would the reaction of the VN government and people be?

                              <span>Hello! I’m visiting Vietnam for the first time in early June. I’ll be landing in Ho Chi Minh City and that will be my planned home base but I want to travel to several places in the two weeks that I have. I’m planning on a day trip to Cu Chi and am wondering what the recommendation would be for visiting the Mekong delta. I think I could spend two days there based on other places I want to see. Would you recommend I stay a couple nights there somewhere or should I plan on maybe two different day trip tours? I would greatly value your advice.

                              <span>I feel like skipping Lao cai/Sa Pa because it&#x27;s (from what i can see) similar to Ha Giang and Ha Giang is big enough
 Other than that, what are places I must visit, if any?

                              <span>I was browsing around and I saw in US that there are a set of test to become a naturalized citizen.
 Does Vietnam have any thing similar to that? What are the tests? How would one qualify to naturalize? 
 When I look into any type of TRC or naturalization I see things mainly regarding investment. I am curious if there are other ways.

                              <span>I forgot to get a travel adapter for my trip to Hanoi in 2 days time. Is it a popular item in Hanoi shops? I know the airport would have, but I’m sure they are very overly priced. I need to plug it into the hotel power and use my Singapore (UK) 3-prong adapters to charge my devices.

She’s used to very mild temperate weather. What are good places for her to play and run around every day? Any indoor options in the city center? Any advice or measures I should take? Thank you.

                              <span>In the last several days, I have not heard much about Vinfast other than the fact that they have discounted their VF 8 to compete with the Tesla Model Y and that they cut their North American workforce. Given that Vinfast has been more silent recently, I am curious what would happen to Vinfast and Vingroup as a whole in the coming months and years? Would Vinfast pull out of the US market and would Vinfast likely crumble just like what happened to Vinsmart? Also, if Vinfast crumbles, what does it mean for Vingroup and Vietnam as a whole?

                              <span>Ok, so I see questions recurring here on importing things from other countries into Vietnam. I do this from time to time, so figured I could tell you what to expect by documenting the last batch a little.
 First, I only import non-food items. My understanding is importing food is more difficult.
 Second, I import for personal use, and pay full duties (usually 10%). I could probably import as my company, but the paperwork is not worth the time for the fees saved, so I don&#x27;t bother and just pay.
 Here&#x27;s the general process:
  
Order your things. Keep the invoice (or other proof of payment) and shipping manifest. You can ship to a residential address without issue. Use a courier service, they will facilitate the paperwork. I typically use UPS or FedEx. 
 Be sure to leave a correct phone numbe…</span>

I am more so looking for second-hand, vintage, handmade, one of a kind type things. Any other markets in other cities that would fit this list and are worth visiting? Thanks!

 I&#x27;m a researcher and have stumble upon a Vietnamese document that I would like to cite. The author is Hà Văn Tân. My question is, which is the first and last name? Typically, work is cited by Last, First name. For instance, Doe, John. 
 Thank you very much

                              <span>Hello world, I will be touring Vietnam on a motor bike next month and wanted to see if anyone has any input on what size bike I should be getting. The best bang for my buck looks to be Honda Winner 150CC. My concern is I am a larger gentleman, 125kg. Will this bike be sufficient for a 3 week trip from Danang to Hanoi or should I opt for a larger bike?

Maybe someone knows something where you can buy good quality for a decent price. I will stay at Hanoi, Ninh binh, Sapa, cat ba, Hoi an, Saigon and phu quoc.

                              <span>My wife and I are planning on coming to Vietnam next year on vacation. I just read that Vietnam dose not recognize the international drivers license I can get issued here in the US. 
 We were hoping to rent a motor scooter like we did in Thailand when we visited.
 How would I go about driving legally?
 If there is no way to get a legal driving permit for my trip how big of a trouble would I get in if I got pulled over while driving?
 In Thailand my international permit was valid, but I saw others get pulled over and asked to pay a 300bhat &quot;fine&quot; to be on their way.
 Please any advice is welcome, I really want to obey the law and do things right. But my wife and I like to explore and hike and get off the beaten path if you will and not being able to drive ourselves around could get costly and put a real damper on our trip.
 Thanks in advance for your time and help. Cheers

                              <span>It is a bit of a long shot but here goes. So my girlfriend and a friend af hers are supposed to fly to Vietnam for a 2 week holiday but currently my girlfriend is stranded on Frankfurt airport because her express visa (or visum) application didn&#x27;t get trough on time. She wasn&#x27;t allowed on the flight because of this. My question to my fellow redditors is this: do you know of a way to try to get her application rushed trough. Or maybe someone knows someone that works at the governement departement that handles visa applications? Or maybe enter a second application? 
 It is a real longshot bu let&#x27;s see if reddit can help.
 Eitherway i appreciatie anyone reading this.

                              <span>Has anybody done this recently? We always have used an agent for this but not this time as it&#x27;s too expensive tbh. My new company will sponsor me the costs and paperworks, (1st time for me as I usually have to shoulder the cost in my previous company. I am not a teacher btw.). This is the first time they will hire a foreigner as well so there HR is also not so familiar. They will assist me as much as they can but brunt of the research will be from my end. I jusy need to know the process in General. They will sponsor me but as much as possible not going through an agent. 
 Ill be doing this first time and I am aware Vietnam always changes rules regarding this. Is this even doable by a foreigner (not married to a Vietnamese too) so language could pose a problem... Just want to get an idea if this is even possible.

Can anyone recommend a decent place that isn&#x27;t too expensive? I&#x27;m not bothered if they are designer knock-off&#x27;s etc. Just looking for some cool frames. Also looking to get progressive frames for my mother too.

                              <span>I’m half vietnamese and half white, I’m curious about this because I’ve never felt much connection to vietnam. Sometimes I think of working on that, but then I don’t really know if I would be “accepted” or just always be seen on as a foreigner (which I am but you know, I’m not 100% foreign)
 Sorry if this is not suitable for this sub

                              <span>As an African American a source of stress is just getting basic services you are use to having access to in the states. 
 Since leaving Texas no one has cared for my hair like my sister, Shamonica Alexander, Trina Stoker and Andise Altine, two stylist I&#x27;ve been seeing for years.
 Last Sunday. I had my hair braided in Vietnam by a woman from the Congo who pretty much tried her damnest to pull all the hair out of my scalp into too tight cornrows. I had to take them down two days later. 
 Well, I don&#x27;t do my own hair and without my trusted hair stylists to rescue the tangled mess. I had a temper tantrum and cut my hair off. I initially wanted to shave it but I only had scissors. 
 Today, I looked for a salon to make me look more presentable but literally had people just flat out deny me service. 
 It took three attempts and a couple of salons to get someone to shape my hair but finally got this kind man to agree to it at N&#x27;Black Barbershop in Phan Thiet, Vietnam
 He was gentle. He didn&#x27;t tear through my hair but most of all I felt respected. I&#x27;m super grateful to him. 
 Haven&#x27;t had much luck today getting someone to give me a manicure or pedicure. Will save that for another day.

What can I do/where can I buy something to sort this out? (Aka kill them)

                              <span>Hi, 
 I’m a Canadian who travelled from Malaysia, now going to Ho Chi Minh, Da Nang, and lastly Hanoi.
 I’d consider myself very tattooed (both arms full, legs, and chest) from artists in Canada and some Malaysia. 
 I can’t find a definitive guideline for appropriate pricing for tattoos. Can anyone shed some light on standard hourly rates? 
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hey there, sorry if this is annoying or the incorrect place to post something like this. 
 I am currently travelling from New Zealand and accidentally left both my wallet and passport in the back of the seat in front of me on the train today.
 I caught the 15:30 train from Ga Sai Gon to Ga Binh Thuan yesterday before taking a grab further to our accommodation.
 I arrived at Ga Binh Thuan and got off the train in a rushed folly. Leaving my thungs.
 I have attempted to contact police tonight, called over 11 times, and was only received once. Before the phone was hungup.
 This is whatever, and I am sure to contact police on the phone or in person tomorrow.
 If anyone might know where my things might be/ who best to contact. 
 I will also try the train company but do not know the exact best course of action.
 Ultimately, I have travel inaurance but hope I can resolve this without resorting to it.
 Thank you kindly for any input/help/advice.

                              <span>Hi, I came to Hanoi yesterday and I&#x27;m trying to find Vietnam-made souvenirs but all I couldn&#x27;t find genuine stuff that I could buy and use on regular basis to remind me of this country. What I found were mostly toys or small plastic/wood low quality items that were painted in a rush, probably even made in China.
 What are some decent souvenirs that I can find in Hanoi? 
 Other than decorative stuff, what else I can buy, like any special spice or snack?

                              <span>Hi we will be visiting vietnam in april for a month coming from thailand or possibilité Cambodge. At that time of the year should we consider going north/center/south? We plan on taking it slow so I don&#x27;t think we will cover the whole country. Thanks

                              <span>We arrived to Hanoi today, the hotel we had booked said they had electricity problems in our room, and showed us another room in another building far below the standard we had booked. We declined because we could see there were other hotels with good offers on Booking.com.
 Now it&#x27;s 2 hours later and we have visited 4, 4 star hotels in the old quarter who all had &quot;Superior/deluxe/..&quot; rooms listed as available at about 70-80% discounts on Booking and when we arrived to see the room they said that it is not available.
 We decided to book some Airbnb outside old quarter instead 😅.
 Is this normal practice in Old quarter/Hanoi/Vietnam or were we just very unlucky.

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;m planning on riding from HCM to Hanoi next month on a motorcycle. What would be a reasonable amount of KM to complete per day? I am just concerned about road conditions and how they would impact travel speeds. I&#x27;m a competent rider and ride a bike every day at home, have ridden in Thailand before.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m travelling to Vietnam soon, 2-3 days in HCMC, a few days on Phu Quoc island, a lot of time in Tan Chau.
 I&#x27;m very into tea and was hoping to find some tea shops that sell good quality loose leaf teas in HCMC and/or Tan Chau. As far as HCMC goes, I&#x27;ll be in District 1 and District 3, with my tight schedule I won&#x27;t be able to leave these areas in HCMC. 
 Any tips? I&#x27;ve found a few on google that look potentially promising (such as Trà Việt), but I wanted to know if there were better shops that I&#x27;m probably missing since I don&#x27;t speak the language, or just some place that&#x27;s a hidden gem. 
 Second, would tea be an appropriate gift for someone&#x27;s family in Vietnam? We have other gifts we&#x27;re bringing (Family member is getting married), but I thought I might add to it with a set of nicely presented teas as a thank you for hosting us.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

The hacker was able to gained access to some internal documents, code and systems at the social media company. To the user side, currently there are no evidence that the attack revealed any non-public data. However, I recommend people changing their reddit password immediately and setting up 2FA if not.
 ​
 Reddit gần đây đã xác nhận rằng họ đã bị hacker tấn công. Kẻ tấn công đã có quyền truy cập một số tài liệu, code và hệ thống của công ty. Về phía người dùng, hiện tại chưa có bằng chứng nào về việc rò rỉ dữ liệu cá nhân của người dùng nhưng mình vẫn khuyến khích các bạn thay đổi mật khẩu tài khoản và lập mã xác thực 2 bước cho tài khoản nếu chưa.

                              <span>Recently, ChatGPT is becoming a hot topic in Vietnam because of how accessible it is to normal users and follow that trend is a booming scam market regarding to create a ChatGPT account. Because of that, I decided to make a post to guide you how to create your own legitimate ChatGPT account.
 Dạo gần đây, ChatGPT đã trở thành chủ đề nóng được quan tâm ở Việt Nam vì dịch vụ dễ dàng tiếp cận đối với người dùng bình thường, chính vì sự bùng nổ đó kéo theo vấn nạn lừa đảo liên quan đến việc tạo tài khoản ChatGPT. Chính vì thế mình quyết định viết bài post hướng dẫn tạo tài khoản ChatGPT chính gốc của bạn.
 ​
  
Because ChatGPT is not supported in Vietnam, you need a VPN to change your IP to another country. In case you don&#x27;t have a VPN, vn-z forum provided a lot of vpn account for you to choose. Bởi vì ChatGPT không hỗ trợ ở Việt Nam, bạn sẽ cần VPN để chuyển địa chỉ IP của bạn sang nước khác. Trong trường hợp bạn không có VPN, diễn đàn vn-z có cung cấp tài khoản VPN cho các bạn thoải mái sử dụng.
 You need a foreign phone number for verification, I recommended smspool because it is reliable, cheap (depends on the country, most likely cost less than 1$) and I used it for my ChatGPT account myself. Các bạn cũng sẽ cần đến số điện thoại nước ngoài để xác minh danh tính, mình khuyến khích các bạn dùng smspool vì nó ổn định, rẻ (tuỳ đất nước bạn chọn, giá thành sẽ thấp hơn 20,000đ).
  
Good luck/Chúc may mắn
 Edit: ChatGPT is now supporting in Vietnam (11/2/2023), however you will need ChatGPT Plus for 20$. Depends on your need, my guide will be cheaper for you. Để tạo tài khoản ChatGPT ở Việt Nam tại thời điểm hiện tại, bạn cần đăng kí ChatGPT Plus với giá 20$ (470,000đ). Tuỳ nhu cầu sử dụng mỗi người, người dùng phổ thông không có 400,000đ dư giả để tiêu thì cách trên mình hướng dẫn rẻ hơn.

                              <span>Hello!
 In two weeks I will be accompanying my wife and our daughter on a short term business trip to Hanoi. Probably three months with short side trips to HCMC.
 What kind of weather can I expect?
 Is it jeans and hoodie or shorts and t-shirt?
 I&#x27;ve been to Vietnam a few times, but never in the north in winter/spring. So I usually pack t-shirts, shorts, light trekking pants and light trekking shirts.
 I&#x27;m a pretty big guy from the Netherlands and have no problems with cold, but heat gets to me quickly.
 Thanks a lot!

 We are thinking of going around Hanoi to get everyone small gifts, our friend, her mom, dad and even the cats haha.
 What are some small gift ideas that would be appreciated? :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be heading to Thailand next week, and I have a TPBank VISA debit card.
 It was issued at the beginning of COVID, couple years back.
 I haven&#x27;t been out of the country in 3.5 years, and will be heading to Thailand - does anyone have any experience using a TPBank debit card in Thailand? 
 Or should I buy some Thai Baht from the gold shops/Noi Bai airport?
  
Decathlon accepts it for online payment, but Lazada doesn&#x27;t (if that helps).

                              <span>Hello, I was curious about whether or not you are allowed to rock climb at Marble Mountain in Da Nang? I was there today and saw the one sport route and the other bolts for setting up anchors. I did more research and saw that tours were operated by Phat Tire Adventures. I went to their website but could not find any information. I contacted them but have still not received a response. I would prefer to climb there without a guide, as I have all the stuff, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was allowed. It seems strange that it is right in the middle of the main pathway. Can anyone lend any insight into this? Thanks!

Is it possible to get through Vietnam without any peanut hiccups? Also if anyone could recommend the best phrase to print out to show to chefs to inform them of this, it would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you!

                              <span>Hey, Vietnam community! I just wanted to share a video I made about the dark history of Li Xi. For those who don&#x27;t know, Li Xi is a popular celebration in Vietnamese culture, but not many people know about the darker aspects of its history. This video delves into that history and provides a new perspective on this important celebration. I think it&#x27;s an interesting and eye-opening watch, and I hope you all find it as educational as I did. Check it out and let me know what you think!

                              <span>Hi everyone, just looking for some advice. Im going to be traveling around Vietnam for 3/4 weeks in March next year. Starting in the north amd making my way down. When im further south so of may family are joining me and im looking for somewhere amazing for them to stay. Id love it to be an island, ive been looking at a lot about phu quoc, but ive heard and seen stories about it being super touristy, a lot of building work going on and a lot of rubbish on some of the beaches. Is this true? Are there any other island or costal places you would recommend that are nicer with beautiful beaches and scenery. Any help would be amazing.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m planning on relocating to Ho Chi Minh City in the near future, and am having trouble finding information online regarding the availability and costs of psychiatric help in the city. Right now I am on two psychiatric medications. While it appears it would not be too difficult to purchase these medications from pharmacies, I would like to have someone in the city who can monitor the effects of the medication, ideally on a monthly basis. 
 Are psychiatrists who have a good grasp of English hard to find in Vietnam? 
 How much would a visit generally cost? 
 Would going to a private hospital monthly to be evaluated be a feasible alternative? 
 I&#x27;ve read about issues with &#x27;fake&#x27; versions of medications; is there a way to ensure I can avoid these? 
 Any additional insights would be greatly appreciated!

I was searching for more since it is something I can watch with my grandma. Any recommendations would be much appreciated. I could take recommendations for any other good Vietnamese movies and find other ways to watch them 🏴‍☠️. Thank you!

 I am looking for advice on what would be the best route to travel around the norther region, leaving from hanoi and returning back there. 
 There are many route options it looks like and want to choose one with lots of good scenery, fun riding, and cool spots to stop.
 We have about 8 days. Also what&#x27;s your favorite bike rental shop, with something a bit bigger, like an xr150 or similar adventure bike. 
 Thanks a bunch!

 My family has only ever brought chocolate (snickers, peanut m&amp;ms, milky ways) and wrigley’s gum. 
 I was thinking about bringing some hot Cheetos, starburst, skittles, warheads, and sriracha for them this time too.

 My partner and I have been planning to travel Vietnam for around 1-2 weeks. We want to explore with the little time we have and we would like to hear your suggestions.
 We will be needing strong internet connection because we still have to manage our business at home from time to time.
 Thank you!

 I’m going to be in Can Tho for some days and I want to photograph along the river. I’m looking for a translator so I can speak to locals. The only requirement would be to be speak Vietnamese, English and to be an open and communicative person. 
 Any hints are appreciated!

                              <span>I just got a 5 years Visa Exemption because my parents were born in Vietnam, then I asked in the embassy what am I allowed to do there with this Visa and if can work..etc, she basically said &quot;you can do whatever you want, just remember to leave the country after 180 days&quot;. 
 -Is this true? Am I allowed to work there? Can I extend the 180 days limit for another 180 days without leaving the country?
 -Any other app to find a place to stay besides Agoda, Booking, Airbnb...?
 -Any recommendations for a good Vietnamese teacher/school for beginners?
 What should I do/know/prepare or whatever before going to live in Hanoi from 15 March to 15 June?
 Any information you would like to share will be really appreciate it!
 Thank you and sorry, English is not my main language.

                              <span>We&#x27;re going to Vietnam soon, staying in HCMC for only 3 nights and originally planned to stay in a hotel but came across advert for home stay with pics of ppl eating together, hanging out etc. So now thinking to do this instead, to meet locals and really see their culture and how they live.
 Good idea? Anyone done this? By the look of travel vlogs it&#x27;s what backpackers do in the north, in the mountains, but is is common in the city? 
 Pls share any experience with this. Thanks x

                              <span>I am 27 and finishing up a degree in the next 6 months to get my CELTA and hopefully teach in either Vietnam or Taiwan. This is something I&#x27;ve wanted since I was a teenager and I will be 28 by the time this becomes possible. My motivations beyond teaching English is to learn the language, however difficult Vietnamese may prove.
 I have been debating between Taiwan or Vietnam for years and have considered as many factors as possible, but one I would like some insight on is how difficult it may prove to form friendships with locals. I do not expect anyone to be enamored by foreigners and I am not looking for super deep friendships. I am not looking for a best friend and I am not looking for a significant other. I don&#x27;t expect to be grabbing dinner or drinks constantly with locals. But I do want to be friends with locals and not solely rely on other expats.
 How realistic is this in Vietnam? I understand given my age where most people will be raising families and the language/cultural differences, that it will prove to be difficult. But once I get a working grasp of Vietnamese (however long and difficult that may be), could I expect to create some friendships with people besides other expats? From what I&#x27;ve read, this may be easier in Vietnam vs Taiwan, and I was looking for insight. I consider myself very friendly and I am always eager to make new friends, so normally this is not difficult for me but I have no previous experience to Vietnam nor living in a country where English is not the first language.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;ve returned to Vietnam recently and need to do a border run for my work permit. A friend of mine said that recently, staff at Phạm Ngũ Lão bus station told him the bus to Moc Bai doesn&#x27;t run any more, and to either take a private taxi or book a bus to Phnom Penh and then just get off at the border (which is obviously a lot more expensive).
 ​
 Google still shows it as an active bus route though. Can anyone confirm?

 My mom usually spends lots of time consuming content that is automatically recommended on Facebook, which in my opinion, is very low-quality and boring. If it matters, her favorite hobbies are singing, gardening, and maybe a bit of stock investment (more like calculated gambling). 
 Any suggestions are appreciated 🙏

 But is there any dB limit before that?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;ll fly into Da Nang tomorrow from Malaysia. I&#x27;m a non-stop traveller, therefore I always bring all my belongings of which my drone is part of. I know that bringing a drone into the country is legal, however flying without permission is not and I reached out to so many officials in Vietnam and my local Vietnamese embassy to apply - without luck of course.
 By now, I couldn&#x27;t care less about not being able to fly without a permit, but I&#x27;m worried about importing the thing via Da Nang, an airport that&#x27;s notoriously famous for its customs officers&#x27; outdated mindset, with them confiscating drones. Obviously I want to avoid that and so I&#x27;m asking if anyone has made any recent experiences there and if it&#x27;s still true that they only scan carry-on, but not checked bags?

                              <span>Just got home from a 3 week vacation in Vietnam. Spent the first week in Saigon, second week at my grandparents place and third week in Phu Quoc. Amazing times. Met amazing people and did a lot of fun things. 
 When I was in Vietnam, I was having fun but also stressed at the same time. There were too much people and traffic. As an introvert, I don’t like when it’s overcrowded. The weather was also too hot for my taste. I was also worried about getting pickpocketed, but luckily nothing happened.
 I told my mom several times that I wanted to go home. And I was so happy when it was finally time to travel back home. But now after returning, I suddenly feel depressed. I suddenly miss my relatives and all the adventures we did. I miss the food and culture also. 
 I told myself that this would be the third and final time I’m travelling to Vietnam, but now I’m itching to go back in the future. Does anyone else feel the same after their trip?

                              <span>This is not a critique of the country or the culture, just a curiosity question.
 I have a couple of female friends who over the past year who told me they are going to get married. 
 One of them told me that her parents are close with the parents of the the impending husband, and that her parents have wanted her to marry the guy for a while. 
 The other is being told by her parents she has to leave Vietnam and go and marry someone in Europe. Its a bit of a match making thing through friends of the family, even though she isn&#x27;t that keen on going. 
 There was another very similar story I came across too this week via a friend&#x27;s friend.
 Is this common? For the parents to essentially choose (or have an extremely strong preference) for who the girl should marry? I always thought this was more an Indian/South Asian thing.

                              <span>I have been living in Vietnam for 5 years. I own a company here and have recently noticed a drastic change in banking policies. MB bank no longer allows foreigners to hold or use a debt card. VIB allows existing foreigner customers to have an ATM card but cannot use that card for purchases in shops or businesses. 
 Is this a change in policy with all banks or only these two?

 Xong tụi dạy IELTS hay thi IELTS kiểu điểm cao cao 1 tí, nó nói Tiếng Anh tui nghe rất sợ, kiểu thiếu tự nhiên xong cố gắng thể hiện rằng mình sophisticated though deep down I know for certain that they&#x27;re shallow af.
 May I know your thought on this? And should we do something to end its monopoly in the english-testing market in Vietnam?

                              <span>My last visit was the month of March 2020. 
 It was one of if not the greatest month of my life even if by week three it felt like I was being chased by COVID.
 A lot of sites we had planned to visit didn&#x27;t happen since most places shut down. At the time we had no idea of the future and really thought we would just visit the following year. Not knowing the world would be shut down. 
 It&#x27;s almost three years later and has life really changed. I&#x27;m a home owner now, have a daughter who is 14 months and a son on the way. 
 Life has become very adulty. 😂 
 Traveling with my wife will never be the same but we always talk about our time in Vietnam.
 It&#x27;s beautiful, the country is appasulty beautiful! The people are appasulty beautiful! We made such great friends on our trip even with the language barrier. Friends who we still keep in touch with till this day. 
 I know we&#x27;ll be back one day most likely when we&#x27;re old. Going to have to skip out on the sleep buses and over night train rides at the point. 😆
 I hope we can visit much sooner than later with or without the kids. I would love to bring my children with me, I want them to be as well traveled as myself.
 I really just wanted to let everyone know how much I miss and love Vietnam and hope to see everyone sooner than later. 
 Ps. I still have yet to find Cao Lau in the states.

The thing is, I can be picky with the design, so I’d like to find a shop that has pictures I can reference.
 Any Saigon shops that ship to Da Nang would be cool too.
 I live in Texas and there aren’t any good shops here, except for in Houston, but I’m not too into their designs either.
 I’m looking for this kind of lace design: https://imgur.com/a/QgTQRXQ

                              <span>I see my options are:
  
1h flight direct / 3h with layover.
 But I’ve heard there is almost always delays with domestic flights here especially with budget airlines. 
 
11h bus ride. Already done 8 hour Saigon to Da Lat &amp; doing 4 hour Da Lat to Nha Trang tomorrow. 
 
11h train. Not heard much. 
 
 What’s the locals option on doing this? What would be my best option we are with a group of 6. Money isn’t the biggest concern but should be considered. Time definitely more valuable as we are moving place to place every 3 days roughly.

 I know Australia accepts temporary workers from all over the world.
 Perhaps someone on Reddit has already been and knows the specifics?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I have recently been offered a management job to join a company in Vietnam. The salary they are offering would be 85 million đồng per month plus minor stock options in the business. 
 I current live in the UK (but not in London) and earn around 15% more than this but I believe even living in HCMC, my living expenses in Vietnam would be much less than what I have now.
 Obviously I know that the average person in Vietnam is not earning 85 million / month, but will this be enough for a foreigner to rent a city centre apartment, get a motorbike (or even car?) and live comfortably?

                              <span>Chào các bạn!
 So after being very confused why my Vietnamese friend was saying words that end in “oc” as “op,” I decided to do some research. Apparently, in Vietnamese, you have to close your mouth for certain ending constants, so a word ending in ung would sound like “ungm.”
 My question to you guys is how say it. I remember teaching my friends how to properly pronounce the Spanish “t” by placing the tips of their tongues on the top part of the back of their teeth. I realize this question is kind of technical, but everything I’ve looked up doesn’t really address it or attributes it to an different accent or dialect (but both Northerners and Southerners do this from my knowledge).
 Any advice? Many thanks! Cảm ơn!
 I also tagged this as discussion since I can’t seem to get a clear answer on how to do this lingual maneuver.

                              <span>Does anyone know what documentation Vietnam immigration needs if a family is traveling with a minor child who is unrelated. For example, Thailand needs a parental travel consent form along with copy of minor’s parents passports and marriage license.

 Can anyone recommend any high quality salons with good hairstylists who can do this? I’m located in Quận 8, but willing to travel to city center if needed.
 Thanks!

                              <span>My girlfriend and I rented an Airbnb for a couple weeks in Hanoi and the host messaged us last night, two days before our arrival, claiming something was wrong with the room so it wouldn’t be available at least the first few days and offered us a much lower cost hotel room he owns instead. This was followed by a bunch of offers to sell us Ha Long Bay tours. I realized he was trying a bait and switch scam on us so we canceled the reservation promptly. Has anyone else dealt with something like this?

 I&#x27;m currently doing research on the impact of venereal disease during the American War. I&#x27;m looking for any Vietnamese sources relating to this (that are either digitised or could be sent to me online, as I am carrying out this research in the UK). There&#x27;s one in particular I&#x27;d love to know more about: Mai dam: Mot te doan? nghe nghiep? Hinh thuc no le? (apologies for lack of tone marks I don&#x27;t have the keyboard on this laptop) 
 Alternatively, if any body knows anyone who might be willing to do an oral interview with me on this sensitive topic, that would be extremely helpful. Please feel free to reach out via message! 
 Cảm ơn!

 My fiance and I (US) are getting married this year and are doing a reception in the U.S. and in Viet Nam with my side of the family who are in Viet Nam. It will be a small affair, of about 25-30 people max, total. Does anyone know of any venues in Saigon that could host this, and/or estimates as to how much an event like this my cost? I read some anecdotes of a low key reception of 50 people costing $1k that included food, MC, music. 
 Honestly any information or experience or advice you would have would be so helpful and much appreciated. I don&#x27;t even know where to start looking, lol. Cảm ơn nhiều!

                              <span>Having lived here for going on four years I&#x27;m constantly amazed that I do not see a vehicular collision every day, given the chaos and rule breaking observed on the roads.
 That said last week an old geezer rear ended my PCX on his 25 year old Wave, or whatever it was.
 Pretty sure he&#x27;d been at the Bia Hoi, and 99% sure his vision wasn&#x27;t 20/20. Add in that it happened at night.
 It&#x27;s said that Thailand is the second most dangerous country in the world re. traffic accidents and fatalities.
 Where does Vietnam fit into the picture re. the aforementioned?
 I drive really slowly, be it in the city or on the bigger roads. Seems that&#x27;s the key. A colleague said to me he treats everyone as a drunk driver looking at their phone.
 Then you have the buffalo boys who hoon around town, helmetless. Surely these guys don&#x27;t last long?
 Interested in what you&#x27;ve seen/been involved in/heard re. the madness that is Vietnamese traffic.
 *Note: not shitting on Vietnam, just want some feedback. For me, traffic and dodgy bosses are the least pleasant aspect of living here. They are balanced out, or outweighed by the positives.

                              <span>Hello, all. I was just hired to teach English at a university in HCMC. I&#x27;m in the USA right now, but I will heading to Vietnam probably at the end of march or beginning of april. 
 Is there anything you recommend that I do before I leave or something I should bring with me? I plan to start doing an hour Vietnamese everyday on Duolingo. I&#x27;m an experienced traveller, and I&#x27;ve lived in Thailand before, but this will be my first time in Vietnam.
 Any advice is appreciated. Cheers

                              <span>My apologies if this isn&#x27;t permitted here.
 I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy A04 about a week ago because I was having issues with my US phone. I paid 2.590.000 ₫ at the FPT Shop in Hoi An. My other phone is now working just fine (of course) and I no longer need the new phone. I have been told that because it was activated that I cannot return it. It also has a local SIM card and it that has just about two gigs of data left. Would anybody be interested in buying this phone from me?

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering visiting Phu Quoc this summer but I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble finding out about the bars there.
 I&#x27;m looking to see if there are laid back, cheap beer, cheap simple mixed drinks, beach bars, not clubs, I don&#x27;t want DJs or raves or anything like that and are they in close proximity to the main resorts?
 I love sitting feet in the sand having a local beer with good conversation.

                              <span>Hi! I will be traveling to Vietnam soon. I know Google does not sell the Pixel 7 officially in Vietnam but since it is made/assembled in Vietnam I was wondering if it is available for purchase there? Please tell me if you know of any shop online or not that sells it.

                              <span>me and my husband was having lunch and enjoying our time. Then suddenly a vietnamese older guy walked into the restaurant and just come up to us and started talking. I could not make out what he was saying. he mumbled a lot to the point I wasn&#x27;t sure if he was even vietnamese. I am vietnamese so i would be able to understand if he wanted something from us. But he especially looked at my husband and told me something. Then he sat down next to us on the other table and kept on talking to us. Finally I can hear what he was saying and he kept mumbling how my husband has to learn vietnamese to communicate. He had this painful, almost angry expression on his face. He seems offended my husband doesn&#x27;t speak vietnamese somehow. 
 The staff finally came over and asked him to leave. She was alone so she didn&#x27;t know how to handle the situation. I asked her about him and she said he seems drunk and not from around the neighborhood. 
 Does this happened to any of you? didn&#x27;t know how to react, was uncomfortable during and after it. he stayed for at least 10mins just talk and talk and talk... so very weird

                              <span>Hi:
 I&#x27;m seeing a lady that mentioned she loves Vietnamese Fish Sauce. We&#x27;re both Americans living in Northern California. 
 I&#x27;d like to surprise her. Some (I&#x27;m sorry, very, very basic) questions.
 - Is there a good fish sauce flavored snack like chips or crackers I could find for her? I&#x27;m in Northern California and there are Vietnamese (or at least large Asian) supermarkets. 
 - If I bought her a bottle of fish sauce for her kitchen is there anything likely to be in an American kitchen she could pair it with? Any brands you&#x27;d suggest? Is fish sauce something you pretty much need to make yourself?
 - If I stop by a local Vietnamese restaurant, what could I order (and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise if the answer is &#x27;anything&#x27;) that would have a lot of fish sauce? Spring rolls?
 ​
 Any help is appreciated!!!
 cảm ơn (looked it up!)

                              <span>(Mods, please delete if this isn&#x27;t in line with sub rules)
 So I&#x27;m planning a trip to SE Asia in a few months, and was wondering what the situation is like for public restrooms in Vietnam? It&#x27;s been over 20ish years since I last came to VN and I don&#x27;t remember what it was like then (was visiting friends and their families, and we were mostly in rural areas).
 Now that I&#x27;m older and a little more sensitive in terms of food, I&#x27;m concerned with eating something that won&#x27;t sit well and I&#x27;ll need to run to the bathroom or something.
 I&#x27;m already planning to pack things like napkins, antibiotics, anti-diarrheals, and other stomach whatever medicine, but just wanted to hear from others what to expect!
 For reference, going to Saigon and Ha Noi for this trip. They&#x27;re big tourist cities, so I&#x27;m assuming it shouldn&#x27;t be a big issue but I understand I shouldn&#x27;t assume.

                              <span>I bought a few of these Kirkland&#x27;s convertible from Costco in Canada and love it. I gifted a few to my dad and he loves it too. Ironically the label says &quot;Made in Vietnam&quot; but I had never seen anything like this before and all my attempts to look for one here haven&#x27;t been successful yet. What I want to look for:
  
Same material. After wearing these I can&#x27;t go back to jeans anymore!
 
The zip convertible is convenient in rainy season.
 
The attached belt and lots of pockets.
 
I&#x27;m a bit big (bellied 😣) for Vietnamese, usually I wear Vietnamese 3XL or Canadian M-L. It&#x27;s a bit difficult to find big sizes here.
 
 I can buy in HCMC or order online. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>The other night my partner and I were having dinner on P. Mã Mây in Hanoi when two local dudes starting attacking another local dude. Large machetes, axes, and sword like instruments were produced. The parties started swinging them at each other. We were a bit taken back because of the time, only 07:00pm, and it was in a semi busy tourist area. It was literally across from a very popular tattoo place. 
 My partner and I got out of there pretty quick smart, but we’re pretty surprised/shocked that this kind of thing happened in a popular street. While both of us have witnessed this kind of violence in our home country (aus), we just weren’t sure what the normal thing to do in Hanoi would be? In Australia, the incident would have incited loads of media and police attention/investigation.
 We kinda just played the ‘eyes shut’ game and didn’t tell anyone about it.
 Should we have reported the incident to local police? Is this a normal thing to happen in Hanoi and is it just underreported to tourists?

                              <span>Tôi có 1 chuyện khá nhạy cảm về nam giới, cần sự giải đáp từ các bạn nam khác( tôi nghĩ các bạn nữ nên lướt qua). Đó là chuyện mặc 🩲, tôi không biết làm cách nào mà các bạn có thể mặc nó mà không bị cộm lên. Của tôi không phải là to quá nhưng mặc vào nó cứ cộm lên trông ngại lắm luôn, nhất là lúc đến trường á. Mặc quần tây của đồng phục trường mình mà nó cộm lên rõ luôn, sợ nhất là bị các bạn nữ nhìn👀. Có ông nào biết cách chỉ tôi nha! Chứ giờ không biết sao, mặc như không mặc, cộm lên như lúc thả rông luôn🥲.

 - international schools: some schools can cost USD$30-40k/year; do they match western school quality?
 - private schools
 - public schools

 👉The pros about Vietnam (good aspects) I like the landscape of Vietnam, some local food, and it&#x27;s somehow easy to connect with the locals (especially in Saigon). I can agree that Viet offers low cost of living if you are willing to lower your standards tremendously and if you enjoy living in low quality housing and eat street food while sitting on baby chairs with the knees up in your face. Viet is not as stressful as the west (west meaning west north Europe, north America). It&#x27;s also fairly easy to get your papers done if you open your wallet 💰💵.

                              <span>Hinduism has a significant presence in Vietnam, primarily among the Cham ethnic minority. There are a few Hindu temples and communities throughout the country.
 The Hindu festivals of Diwali and Navaratri are celebrated by Vietnamese people.
 In India, Maha Shivaratri is a significant Hindu festival observed in honor of Lord Shiva. On this day devotees of Lord Shiva, observe a day-long fast, remain awake all night, and perform puja to celebrate the auspicious occasion of Maha Shivratri. 
 I was curious to know if Mahashivratri is also celebrated there in Vietnam?

 ​
 Are you aware of any shop that buy used clothes in Ho Chi Minh City ? 
 I have white shirts in good conditions from brands like Uniqlo but that doesn&#x27;t fit me anymore... 
 Thank you

                              <span>I know it’s kind of indescribable to think that there’s a bad signer on Paris by Night. People, primarily older folks, thought that every singer is good. I saw that Loan Châu, the Trúc sisters (Trúc Lam &amp; Trúc Linh), &amp; Như Loan are often criticized for their voices, but I would like to hear your thoughts. Who do you think is the worst singer on PBN?

                              <span>Is it only in the northern Vietnam or throughout the whole country that you Wi-Fi sucks and you sometimes can’t even download a file with a decent speed ? Is it really the shark-bitten-cable problem ?

                              <span>That&#x27;s probably one of the biggest turn offs for me, maybe Im just too westernized or whatever but my love for the country has soured quite a bit ever since I was a teen. And because of the past you know that stuff will never go away. More recently exceptionalism has manifested through promotion of cultural aspects. Best food, best scenery, friendliest people ! Humble my ass. Why learn about any other culture or move anywhere right ? Vietnam&#x27;s the place to be type shit. Most people just love the country, they dont think we&#x27;re the chosen people or anything, it&#x27;s more so the attitude online and the media sometimes that bug tf out of me

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I was born and raised in America. Both of my parents are Việt Kiều, and gave me the opportunity to study and practice the language, so I am fluent but by no means a professional. I just came back from Vietnam, and a lot of locals told me that my Vietnamese is correct, but that they know I am a foreigner because my way of speaking sounds &quot;lớ lớ.&quot; Their English is limited, so I couldn&#x27;t understand when they tried to explain what the phrase means. Any help appreciated, cảm ơn!

                              <span>Hi everybody, thought I would do a small post regarding some thoughts and observations since I&#x27;ve been here, would love to hear what you guys have to say. Here for a month from Australia, South to North. Currently in Ho Chi Minh/Saigon. 
 - Cleanliness; The CBD/City centre is insanely clean? I saw almost no rubbish at at all, and the rate of construction and urban development has blown me away. I&#x27;m unsure if its just buildings for show but it looks great. Some outer suburbs reminded me of other parts of Asia i&#x27;ve been in but that is correlated to a lower socio-economic situation obviously. 
 - Food; I&#x27;ve tried both street &amp; restaurant food, it is absolutely delicious and extremely cheap, I can see what the hype is about.
 - People; People have been friendly mostly smiles and what not, serv…</span>

                              <span>Hey, I am flying soon from South Korea to Vietnam and from Vietnam to Bali. I only have 2h to make it to next plane from Vietnam to Bali. Does any one know if using Vietjet air for both flights I need to do check in again in the Vietnam airport changing flights? Or can they do check in when I am taking first flight for both flights? I am worried not to make it to next flight if I need to do check in again, plus I would need to get visa to enter Vietnam.

 Does anyone know the name of this exact remix of Khong Phai at 25:02 in this DJ set? https://youtu.be/i9mCWpytHfA?t&#x3D;1502 
 I hope it&#x27;s not a remix by the DJ themselves. I&#x27;ve been listening to this set a lot and it&#x27;s definitely my favourite part! 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am quite worried. Please help.
 I’m a dual-citizen: Armenian and American. I arrived into Laos today from Thailand with my Armenian passport and I had a visa for it. The border patrol rejected my entry because they wanted me to get into Laos using my American passport given that I got Thai entry/exit stamps in that passport. So I had to reapply with a visa on arrival using my American passport. This caught me by surprise because I’ve switched my passport several times while visiting countries and it has never been a problem.
 AND I’m going to Vietnam in 2 days and I have a visa approval for Vietnam under my Armenian passport again. A worker at Laos’ immigration said it’s fine if I enter Vietnam and that the rules are different but I want to be sure. Vietnamese consulates in Laos are closed for the weekend and I can’t get help from anyone. Does anyone have more information about this? Does Vietnam allow passport swapping?
 Note: there’s no visa on arrival for Armenians or Americans.

                              <span>Have been listening to Den Vau wowy and binz this past year and I honestly think Den Vau is in a league of his own. Also curious if there’s anyone who raps and story tells like he does.
 Id say he’s the Kendrick Lamar /Jcole for Vietnam in terms of rappers but open to suggestion to see if there’s anyone better.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ll be moving there for work and have tried searching for more info but haven&#x27;t had much luck besides the basics.
 - What is rent like (cheap or affordable)?
 - Is it local or a mix with foreigners?
 - What&#x27;s the commute like to D1 or D2?
 - Is there a nightlife?
 - Are there many gyms? I wanted to look into learning mixed martial arts...any options there?
 - Is it busy (traffic/noise etc.)
 Overall, what should I expect? Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: thanks for answering my questions!

                              <span>When I first came here, I loved it and openly spoke on TV and media about how great it is here. The people were great, everyone had a huge &quot;togetherness&quot; spirit when COVID started.. Now.... I absolutely hate it. Everyone, every day, is trying to screw each other over. Old people are vile and rude as fuck, acting like a bunch of gorillas. Everyone has an agenda. Companies are dishonest. People try to kill you on the road and act cowardly when confronted. When I came here, I was on TV talking about how great Vietnam is, but I&#x27;ve never in my life been tricked, lied to or screwed over as much as here. I am deeply depressed and miserable. HOWEVER, I am trying to reconnect with the reasons why I loved this place. One last ditch effort to regain happiness here.. maybe some of you can help me re-ignite that spark again. What is it that you like about living here? EDIT: I&#x27;ve been here 3 years

                              <span>Rant: I&#x27;m out today and the air quality is just so bad, literally afraid to inhale. It gets worse over the year and I see no sign of the government trying to do anything about it. In a decade I can only imagine what devastating public health disaster it will cause.

                              <span>Like title said, my gf was recently accepted to ILA and will fly to saigon in May. Her employer said she will be assigned which center to work at based on where she lives. So im looking for an apartment or room (with her own kitchen and good enough privacy) in the southern half of the city. If the location is near centers in Phú Lâm, Bình Tân, Hùng Vương, Him Lam, Nguyễn Cư Trinh or Phú Mỹ Hưng thatd be ideal. Her budget is 12 million per month and that hopefully covers everything she needs to worry about rent-wise.

                              <span>I’ve read that you’re expected to haggle the prices down, which could get you around 40% of the advertised cost, is that true? Also, is there places and things where you just pay the advertised price, like for food and drinks? It’s my first time in Vietnam, and will be staying around Old Quarter area. Any do’s and dont’s I should be aware of when shopping?🤔

                              <span>I do not think the news was already posted here, but the Michelin Guide is coming in Vietnam. First edition of the guide will be released in June.
 I think it’s a great think for Vietnam – It will help a lot the restaurants aiming to offer fine dining especially Vietnamese ones.
 What are your prognostics about the potential decorated restaurant in Vietnam?
 My opinion:
 - No 3 Stars Restaurants. I really do not think any venue in Vietnam is there yet. Bangkok does not have any 3 Stars Restaurants.
 - Anan Saigon: I really see them decorated. I tried them few years ago it was great, but it seems what they offer now is more elaborated. It’s the only restaurant in Vietnam that made to Asia’s Top 50 + their food relates a lot to Vietnam
 - I also think that the Guide will give one Star to a good Street food stall / place either in Ha Noi or HCMC. The guide did that both in Thailand (Jay bee) and Singapore. It’s a way for them to not appear too snobbish and it’s good PR…
 - Maybe one or two high end French Restaurants from Ho Chi Minh City: I have tried 3 Gourmands / La Villa / P’tit Saigon / Le Corto. All of them are great but I guess inspectors of the guide have been eating a lot in “similar” restaurants. I am just not sure if they will be &quot;good enough&quot; to get one Stars with French Cuisine. I could also add La Badiane in Ha Noi to this list.
 - One or more Japanese Restaurant? Likely – There is so many great Japanese Restaurant both in Hanoi et HCMC. I have just not tried enough of them to have an any name in mind.
 For the locals not familiar with how the Guide works ( I have seen many mistakes both on Facebook and local news sites) we wrote this article: https://amthuchiendai.vn/tat-ca-nhung-gi-can-biet-ve-cam-nang-michelin/

 Couldn&#x27;t find on Shopee/Lazada unfortunately. Thanks!
 (if not Hcmc, any othet city is as good as well)

                              <span>Hey guys! I&#x27;m a high school student doing an essay about the opinions of all HCMC residents on air pollution here. As a HCMC native, we acknowledge that air pollution do exist in HCMC. However, the opinions of each and one of us varies, more so for the opinions of different generations. My essay aims to find the relationship between age and perspective on air pollution.
 Please help a student out and fill out this survey! It only takes a few minutes at most. Thank you!
 Thesis statement: An investigation into the relationship between age and their perspective on air pollution in Ho Chi Minh City.

                              <span>Hi, quick question! I’m traveling in Vietnam right now and am currently in Hoi An. I’m supposed to fly out on the 4th to Hanoi and stay there until the 7th.
 I’m dumb and didn’t realize the 4th is the lunar festival and that Hoi An will be having lanterns float out! Is it worth it to change my dates and lose one day in Hanoi to see this festival? 
 Advice is appreciated :)

                              <span>Going to be travelling through Vietnam in April - spending 3 days in Hanoi, 3 in Hoi An and 4 in HCM. Looking to get some suits made, maybe a sweater and a coat too as well as shirts and trousers. Have heard that Hoi An is a bit of a tourist trap in this regard and wondering if there are better tailors for the same price in the other cities. Looking to spend between $150-$250 USD for suits. Anyone got any recommendations/tips? Cheers!

 We will arrive in Hanoi. What area of the city do you recommend us to stay in? Is Couchsurfing safe and popular there? 
 We want to spend some days in Hanoi and then visit other places. 
 We love food (especially street food), cultural places and nature. We would love to visit local spaces and not the big cities or touristic spots. 
 What would be your recommendations?

                              <span>Hello Everyone! Flying into Hanoi at the beginning of April and plan to spend 5 nights near Ha Long Bay. So any advice on the following will be greatly appreciated.
 Any recommended Ha Long Bay cruise companies? Im looking for luxury cruises. No budget. I already looked into Genesis and Athena. Please let me know your experiences.
 Is it recommended to stay in Cat Ba for a few nights? or Ha Long? or Hanoi? I plan to do a 2 night cruise starting my second day, so ill have 2 nights to burn. I&#x27;m looking to do some exploring but mostly want to relax. Ill most likely be flying out of Hanoi.
 Thanks for any/all advice given!

                              <span>I have been making chanh muoi for a few months and I feel like mine never matches what I really get in any restaurants. I wanted to know how other people prepared there&#x27;s to see the differences in the way I&#x27;m doing it. 
 All I&#x27;m doing is adding one piece chanh muoi to a glass, crushing and stirring it, add sugar and cold soda water. I&#x27;ll be getting superfine sugar to dissolve more easily but anything else you guys do?

I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s due to some lines being cut. Does this happen often? How long does a fix usually take??

                              <span>Hello, I would like to ask anyone who has any knowledge on the topic I wrote about in my title.
 To put it simply, I am currently filing taxes for 2022 and it asks for my marital status in which I understand that I should put Married but am unsure which type of Married filing I should put, whether separately, jointly or head of household.
 I am also working on papers to bring my wife to the US, so I don&#x27;t know if picking one of these choices is more beneficial than the other. Although, I do know that filing jointly is much more difficult and may take time to obtain certain papers.
 She does not have an income if that matters.

 A local internet service provider reported Monday that the Intra Asia (IA) cable has been encountering problems since last Saturday. There was a breakage at a cable section located about 130 km from a shoreline station in Singapore, causing a total loss of international data from Vietnam to Singapore through the IA cable.
 The latest breakage means that only one undersea cable connecting Vietnam globally, the SMW3, remains fully functional.
 Vietnam is currently connected with seven undersea cables: SMW3, AAG, IA, APG, AAE-1, SJC2 and ADC. Besides the recent breakage of the IA, problems with the AAE, AAG and APG cables tha…</span>

 (Total is 1 billion vnd/ Roughly 40k USD)
 I recently asked about it and their replies were a bit vague.
 I&#x27;ve heard some bad stories about VK and locals ripping them off.
 In your opinion how trustworthy are Vietnamese locals? What are the chances they run off with it in your opinion?
 50%? 5%?

                              <span>Anyone know of the best app to learn some Vietnamese? I tried Duolingo which seemed pretty bad for it. I’m currently using an app called Mondly, and have complete all the free stuff but now need to pay for more, so wanted to check if there was a better one before I paid. 
 Or should I be less lazy and just create my own learning cards/prompts and study the language that way?
 Thanks in advance
 Edit: I will be living in HCM so southern dialect

 A friend and I are travelling to Vietnam in two weeks. We also planned to attend a Vietnamese cooking class. How can we find/book such one half day/a few hours classes?
 Preferably in English and in HCMC (Saigon) or also Hanoi

                              <span>I am 23 and I am planning on moving to Vietnam, while doing research it is abundantly apparent that the most common job for expats is to teach English. I have no problem teaching. However, my passion is in public policy (of which I am getting a degree for it now). Unfortunately when I look for job opportunities for expats working in the government I can’t see anything. Does anyone know anything more about this? 
 Btw, I am planning to move when I finish my degree in the next few years or so.
 Edit: not looking to be an elected representative or anything. More like administrative work ie: assisting with permits/ regulations.

 Im planning to take my dad to hoi an for a month in march. I was wondering if anyone could recommend a homestay/BnB with a private room for around 300$ a month in the general old town area. would love a pool included if possible, but its not necessary. 
 THanks for your time. :)

                              <span>I just booked my first trip to Hanoi, so I’m now planning my trip and looking up places to stay and shop. Is it true that so many places are still closed?! For instance around this area where I was hoping to do some shoe shopping, I see dozens of buildings listed as such.
 8 P. Hàng Dầu, Ly Thai To, Hoàn Kiếm, Hà Nội
 I tried viewing from Google maps but seems they haven’t updated since 2014 lol I hope I haven’t picked a bad time to visit!

                              <span>Hello, I booked a round trip to Bai Chay/ Ha Long bay for one day (10.30AM- 18.30 PM) and I wanted to simply enjoy a nice view and possibly hike in a quiet place (hence the idea to spend most of the time in Cat Ba). Would I miss much by only doing that? I would be happy to do a 1/2 hrs boat tour in the bay, but all I see are expensive cruises taking a lot of time-or you know some? Any advice/link appreciated!

  People drink at a Highlands Coffee shop in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Y&#x27;all can check out more number here: Many Vietnamese spend more on drinks than main meals: report - VnExpress International 
 Another 33% of respondents are willing to spend VND20,000-40,000 on drinks, according to the survey of 3,940 consumers conducted by food and beverage market solutions firm iPOS.
 Only 14% said they would splurge more than VND70,000 for a drink, the equivalent of the price of a drink at high-end coffee shops such as Starbucks and Runam Bistro, it added.
 Nearly 54% of respondents said they visit coffee shops once to twice a month.
 I believe that the avg. hour rate in Vietnam is less than 25,000 VNĐ. How could they spend over 3 hours of working daily for a coffee?

Also, if you have a long layover (14 ish hours) can you leave the airport? And do you need a visa? Will my luggage be checked through to my final destination? From what I have read it can be a bit hit-and-miss. Thank you!

                              <span>Greetings,
 I [M, 27] will soon graduate my bachelor of Computer Science in Netherland this July. I am planning to look for a job relates to my studies in Vietnam, therefore wondering if jobs relate to AI/software are plenty to find in Vietnam. Also how much I can earn and where I can find such jobs (LinkedIn perhaps?)
 I am humbly asking for you opinions.

                              <span>Hi I was wondering whether it would be possible to cycle the Ha Giang Loop? I am planning on heading to Vietnam in the second half of August and am desperate to travel on the Ha Giang Loop but not on a motorbike and also not someone else taking me. I am a very capable cyclist but I was basically wondering if it was possible and safe? I would be happy to make it a large proportion of the trip so if there would be any safer potentially longer routes/roads? And where would be a good place to hire or purchase a good quality bike ( may be cheaper just buying) but would rather hire? I understand this is not the usual way to do the loop but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much

                              <span>I&#x27;m mid 30&#x27;s(M) going to HCMC mid February and was wondering if there are bar or nightlife areas that aren&#x27;t as crazy as Bu Vien but not super high society either. Lived in Thailand for seven years so hanging out on backpacker walking streets the majority of my nights there isnt something I wanna do, I&#x27;ll go and check it out for a bit but I&#x27;m getting a tad bit old for all night drinking sessions with pounding music but I&#x27;m also not looking for HiSo speakeasy places where I have to get dressed up lol Oddly specific question I know, was just wondering if there are areas like that, small beer bars with a pool table and the like. Dont really care if there are ladies or not, that&#x27;s not my objective but if there are it wont bother me either and faux british pubs aren&#x27;t really my thing either lol. Thanks for any suggestions

 Đúng, ta đâu cần nhất thiết phải tryhard quá mức làm gì, sống theo kiểu lying flat, chỉ làm đủ ăn, không tiêu sài hoang phí, không bị cuốn vào vòng xoáy chủ nghĩa tiêu dùng, không phải cạnh tranh, đấu đá nhiều làm gì chi cho mệt. Thì tôi nói thẳng luôn, là TÔI ĐÉ\ CHẤP NHẬN SỐNG CUỘC ĐỜI NHƯ THẾ*
 Cuộc sống này là những cuộc cạnh tranh khắc nghiệt, miễn là mà.y còn thở, thì mà.y vẫn sẽ cứ mãi tiếp tục đấu tranh (có thể hiểu theo nhiều nghĩa). 
 Cuộc sống này phức tạp hơn thế nhiều. Ngay từ khi ta học tiểu học thì đã có những cái khái niệm như điểm số, top những học sinh có điểm trung bình cao nhất lớp, hay những cuộc thi học sinh giỏi rồi. 
 Cuộc sống này luôn vận động và thay đổi theo từng …</span>

 I&#x27;m Vietnamese-American (28F) and have visited my family in Việt Nam several times. But, the last time I visited was in 2016. My husband and I are planning a long vacation in Việt Nam late summer this year and I was wondering what street fashion for young adults in their 20s is like now, for both men and women. My husband is white so he&#x27;s going to stand out no matter what, so I&#x27;m not worried about looking like I am a &quot;local&quot;, but am really just interested in how street fashion has changed since I last visited and what is commonplace now. 
 In college, I met an exchange student from Việt Nam and when he saw me wearing short running shorts, he was appalled and asked why I was wearing those. I was confused why he was so shocked and he said in Việt Nam, only prostitutes wear shorts that short (they were like...mid-thigh length). This was back in 2014, though... I have no idea how accurate that reaction was to what&#x27;s commonplace though because I&#x27;ve never been there long enough to really notice or outside of my family&#x27;s district to see much else. 
 Cảm ơn nhiều!

                              <span>What is the Vietnamese law regarding a baby born out of wedlock between a couple who is not married to each other? The couple is MARRIED to other parties. They did not divorce their married partners.
 What happens when the baby is born? Can the baby get the birth certificate? Who can apply for the birth certificate? What procedures if the father or mother of the baby apply for the birth certificate?
 The father of the baby&#x27;s Family Book is in Dong Nai and the baby&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family book is in Tay Ninh?

                              <span>hello!
 i have been searching for a country with rather cheap living costs and a nice climate. people have been suggesting the SEA countries. so, is vietnam really that cheap in 2023? most if not all countries have been hit with severe electricity ,gas, and just general goods price increase. especially europe, so im now looking for a country to maybe move to...
 also, is healthcare free in vietnam? how about job? how much is the minimum wages?

                              <span>Edit: They are in Da Nang. 
 Hello! 
 Back in December, my airpods were stolen in Da Nang. Since I was flying out the same day, I couldn&#x27;t do much and went my way. 
 Today, I got a ping on Find My app with the exact address. They are in Phuoc Ninh, Hai Châu, Da Nang. 
 What are my options to recover them? Would the police take this seriously? 
 They were my first gift to my would be fiance, so the emotional value matters a lot more than the financial value.

                              <span>I’m flying into Hanoi. I’ve read bits about how bringing fresh high denomination notes can get you a better exchange rate than just withdrawing cash when you are there? 
 If that’s the case, can anyone recommend a place to do this in Hanoi? 
 Or should I just withdraw cash when I arrive? 
 Thank you!!

 Last year I went to Thailand and the subreddit r/Thailandtourism helped me a lot because I could look I could look up a lot of stuff and ask questions. It seems like there is no equivalent subreddit for traveling Vietnam, is there a site which a lot of people use that I just don&#x27;t know of? Or is traveling through Vietnam that much rarer and information is not sought after?
 It feels like I just don&#x27;t know a very obvious site/forum...

                              <span>Need help choosing which Ha Giang Loop tour to take!
 Planning to do a 3/4 day Ha Giang Loop tour with an easy rider (can’t ride a motorbike, and honestly some parts of the route looks hella dangerous for someone w no experience). Saw lots of different tour groups, and most of them (Jasmine Hostel, Ha Giang Road Trip, QTmotors) seem to have pretty good reviews, making it kind of hard to choose between them. Could someone recommend me a suitable one based on these criteria?
 (1) Can arrange for transport back and forth from Hanoi (2) Experienced, heavy focus on safety (3) Really just a personal preference, but would prefer one with less of a ‘party’ vibe. Saw lots of videos with HUGE groups that are kind of loud and wild at night, and honestly I’d just like one with more of a chill vibe/ a smaller group (4) I don’t mind spending more, but lower prices would be great!
 Also, is there a big difference in the weather in end April and middle of May? 
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: I’ll be doing this in End April/May :) do PM me if you’re planning to go there too!

                              <span>A lot of people have told me to avoid ice in my drinks as it’s unfiltered tap water? As well as seafood and salads etc. I’m wondering with all these conditions per se it feels like I’m walking thin ice just to enjoy my holiday; although I imagine something like typhoid or salmonella would be much worse etc etc. How do the locals avoid this? How do you know what’s safe to eat etc considering there is so many of you. Or is it much less of a worry then made out too be?

 I might come back to the central region just to see more of hue. 
 Anyone likes hue too? Especially on a scooter, its really enjoyable that way
 No one talks about the nearby rolling hills near the tombs. They are amazing.

                              <span>Looking for insights on the following;
 I am considering to move from Europe to HCM with my GF(Vietnamese). I&#x27;ve visited the city few times and absolutely love it. However, I would like to know how is the worklife in Vietnam (e.g. working style, hours)? Obviously companies are not the same - is there a large difference when working in a Western company and local?
 My concern comes from previous experience, when I was working in a Chinese company, and did not find the working style to be suitable for me. I felt that there was not enough freedom to conduct work within the strict corporate hierarchy. Also, had too much unnecessary work (internal processes), which requires constant overtime. Are Chinese and Vietnamese working styles similar or different?
 I&#x27;m currently working in senior management, and I&#x27;m not able to speak Vietnamese.
 All comments highly appreciated!
 Tldr: planning to move to Vietnam, would like to know more about the worklife

                              <span>Hello, My parents are both Vietnamese immigrants who immigrated after 1975. I was born in Canada. I went to Vietnam on a tourist visa, however, the process is long and arduous. As I read on the Vietnamese Embassy in Canada’s website, a child of Vietnamese citizens could get exempt from a visa. However, as my parents both have Canadian passports, I don’t think this is feasible, but would ask if in any way I could be exempt from a visa or maybe claim Vietnamese citizenship from my parents. Thank you!

                              <span>Hey all! Visiting Vietnam in March, and am curious if there are things to do in Phong Nha if you aren&#x27;t super sporty or adventurous? I&#x27;m good with an afternoon cave trip, or an afternoon guided hike, but more than that would be overwhelming for me. Is it still worth visiting if my priorities are soaking up the landscape, eating good food, and taking photos no one will ever see?

                              <span>I’ll be heading to Vietnam in late February. I’d like to visit just one city and spend time getting to know it as well as I can. I like to walk around a lot, go to museums and eat local food. 
 Which city do you recommend? 
 Appreciate it!

                              <span>I saw these beauties on my last trip to Saigon at one of the markets. For those of you who are frog connoisseurs, how are these things cooked and then eaten...fried, boiled, barbecued ? Are they considered to be quite a delicacy and rather expensive? Are there different varieties of frogs...some that might be delicious and some that would not make for &quot;good eating?&quot;

                              <span>Chào mọi người. Tôi hiện đang sử dụng một ứng dụng dịch thuật nên tôi xin lỗi nếu ngữ pháp của tôi không chính xác. Tôi muốn thể hiện sự đánh giá cao của mình với một người bạn rất tốt của tôi, gần đây cô ấy đã là một tảng đá đối với tôi và tôi muốn thể hiện sự đánh giá cao của mình với cô ấy. Cô ấy tình cờ là người Việt Nam nên tôi tự hỏi liệu tôi có thể làm gì hoặc làm gì để bày tỏ rằng tôi đánh giá cao cô ấy như thế nào. Và cho cô ấy thấy rằng tôi cũng ở đó để hỗ trợ cô ấy. tôi có thể làm đồ trang sức bằng kim loại quý vì vậy tôi đã nghiêng về đồ trang sức nhưng tôi không chắc về ý nghĩa văn hóa của một số món đồ nhất định. tôi không muốn vô tình cầu hôn vì tôi đã làm một kiểu nhẫn nhất định hoặc làm một thứ gì đó không phù hợp với mối quan hệ của chúng tôi. cô ấy là một trong những người bạn thân nhất của tôi. Bất kỳ giúp đỡ hoặc tư vấn được đánh giá cao

                              <span>My friend and me going to drive with our motorbike from HCMC to Da Nang and looking for some recommendation on the road. We are focussing on beaches, nice small villages/cities, rural areas and mostly nature.
 Our itinerary so far: HCMC – Phan Thiet – Da Lat – Nha Trang – (Hoi An) – Da Nang. Any beautiful spot in-between?
 We&#x27;ve been in Vietnam 2 times, traveling with the bike South to North and love this country, the people and the cuisine. We had good times here and looking forward to see new things.
 Thank you :-)

                              <span>Nothing against the Kinh, but I&#x27;m looking for something that feels a bit different, since I already live in the country. Usually when you go to the more diverse provinces (Lào Cai, Hà Giang, ...), the hotels are all run by Kinh people. I once asked a hotelier in Sapa about this and he said &#x27;they [referring to Hmong/Dao] don&#x27;t know how to run businesses&#x27;, which was amusingly direct.
 Anyway, any good recommendations in scenic areas in the far North? I would love to fall asleep to the sound of a different language (Hmong, Dao, Tày, anything really) being spoken by the proprietor&#x27;s family. Many thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m from Malaysia, I just got back from Vietnam, Saigon, few days ago during Chinese New Year, it was my first time being in Vietnam.
 The people there were super friendly, compare to the other neighbouring SEA countries, I would dare say THE MOST friendly and interactive people, I actually felt welcomed. Food was amazing, the street food blew my mind, I ate banh mi twice a day, daily and never got sick of it. Never got to try pho but I had bun bo hue and others which I don&#x27;t knkw what it was, I just pointed the picture, nod and bow a little cause I felt bad that I couldn&#x27;t speak Vietnamese.
 My mistake was not knowing that Vietnamese was celebrating Lunar New Year and most shops were closed for 3 to 4 days and we didnt get to see, eat most of the food we wanted to try, experience the culture, went to vung tau on the 4th day instead, wrong choice I would say because I think the locals went there for holiday or went back to their hometown, that&#x27;s my assumption, so the traffic was pretty heavy but it was a fun.
 I should have gone there on the 5th day of Lunar New Year/Chinese New Year but all and all, it was an amazing place, fell in love with Vietnam just like how I fell in love with Japan when I first visited it, Extremely friendly, yes I can&#x27;t express enough the friendliness of the Vietnamese
 My next trip is to visit Hanoi, any recommendations of place to visit? Food to try or anything that the locals usually enjoy
 Thank you, from your neighbour, Malaysia

                              <span>Hello all, 
 If this is answered in a different thread, obviously please direct me accordingly. 
 I&#x27;m looking for a range of recommendations whether it be food, sights, experiences for when I visit in a few days. Will be flying into the North and working my way down south. 
 Any recommendations be appreciated! 
 Many thanks.

 During a travel In Vietnam, i met someone special for me and now that I&#x27;m at home (not in Vietnam), I would like to send her a gift. I thought about buying some things from Aliexpress and tell them to deliver to her address. Is there any special thing I should be aware before sending her gifts? I mean, any special regulations about Aliexpress in Vietnam, any special way to pay for the taxes, anything I should be aware? Or can I just send it normally like I would do to send it to any other country?
 Thanks you in advance!

                              <span>Hi! I will be travelling for the very first time to Hanoi and i am planning to get an apartment there for a whole month, but I am very undecided about where to stay. I don&#x27;t drive and usually walk everywhere, I&#x27;ve been told I should stay in Tay Ho and it looks great for walking, but I am also wondering whether for a first trip it would be better to stay in Old Quarter? As I would like to also have access to the buses / trains to do trips to Halong Bay / Sapa etc.
 I&#x27;ve actually eyed an apartment which is exactly in between Tay Ho and Old Quarter, near the Tran Quoc Pagoda. Google Maps says it&#x27;s a 25-30 minutes walk in either direction which i normally would not mind at all, but I&#x27;ve heard horror stories about the traffic in Hanoi so I am wondering whether this is doable or not?

 I am not sure if my question belongs here, if it doesn&#x27;t please feel free to ignore it / delete it.
 I (m33) am married to a vietnamese (w28) since 7 years now. We don&#x27;t life in Vietnam but we are here for a prolonged time often, mostly to stay with her Family.
 When I met my wife she was a sweet, cute, self conscious and family oriented person which i fell in love with. After we got our son 5 years ago we had a rough time for a couple of years. I needed to work too much to provide for us and she had the burden of taking care of the kid most of the time. In my opinion she fell into depression during that time which i was unable to recognize.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I really enjoy coffee and have been in Vietnam for almost a month now. I&#x27;ve noticed that when I order a Den / Black Coffee (no sugar, no additives) it usually comes with a cup of water (sometimes hot water).
 Is there a reason for this? Am I supposed to do something with the water such as mixing it or perhaps drinking water first, then drinking the coffee? Just curious. I thank you in advance.

We need it for big amount of online meetings in case our wifi will be causing problems, so we really need reliable and fast provider. We will be in Danang if it helps. Thank you in adavnce!

                              <span>Hello r/Vietnam,
 I am currently living in Yen Bai and I was wondering if there are any other redditors living in this area. I would love to organize a meeting where we can get to know each other, share our experiences, and maybe even plan some activities together.
 It would be great to connect with people who share a common interest and it would be nice to have a community to rely on.
 So, if you live in Yen Bai, please let me know in the comments and let&#x27;s see if we can make this happen.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been living in this lovely country for the past four years. Pleiku has been on my list for traveling for 2 years. I and 3 other friends decided to travel to Pleiku during Tết. Simply, Amazing. As an expat, I would highly recommend folks to travel to Pleiku. The people, food, nature/scenary, culture, history and weather-(depending on the time of year ofc))
 Would also love to hear people&#x27;s experience about coming here pre and post covid:)!
 Chúc mừng năm quý mão các bạn ơi ♥️

                              <span>My vietnam passport is about to expire and I would need to renew it. The problem is that I don’t live in SF, NY, pr Houston, and their website doesn’t really say enough information of the fees and other papers needed (if any). I tried to call them but they never picked up. Has anyone renewed their passport recently? Or know how to do it? Thank you

                              <span>Hi! Is there any martial arts that are native to Vietnam, like Muay Thai is to Thailand? I haven&#x27;t heard of any and I would love to learn more about them if they exist.
 Also, is martial arts just not very popular in Vietnam? It seems there aren&#x27;t many pro boxers who come from Vietnam. Is martial arts not as deeply rooted in Vietnamese culture as places like Thailand, China, and Japan?

 But odopo redirects me to change the date on the vietjetair site. How do I do this, I have the flight id but no account, does someone know how to change it?
 Thanks in advance:)

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for recommendations on the history of Vietnam from a Vietnamese perspective. In particular books covering 19th and 20th century (both, or either!) Must be available in English.
 Finding it very difficult to find books that are not memoirs of American soldiers! Very much want to read from a Vietnamese perspective.

                              <span>So the last time I actually watched it was 2020 but even before that I did not even pay attention to the show at all. There were way too many ads and the contents were not that good. I understand what they tried to refer to but I don&#x27;t appreciate them much (mostly because the way they make jokes about events of the year do not solve anything and for me, normalizes all that shits); and yah, I do not find their jokes or &quot;deep&quot;.
 BUT, I understand why some like it and that&#x27;s great for them.
 What I am quite puzzled about is that some would go all the ways to look down on all those who don&#x27;t like the show. Some would even make remarks and insults others over this.
 So please educate me, is there any thing else about the show that makes it &quot;sacred&quot;? or is it just some people being too close-minded?

If you do, could you recommend me where to buy it? I’d like to know hoping that it would be cheaper compared to where I live now. Thanks!

                              <span>Recieved a term sheet from a local startup. I&#x27;m looking to negotiate/restructure the offer the deal to focus on ownership and future initial offering options. But this would be way over my head. I&#x27;ve been given good advice so far, to look for the equivalent corporate/employment attorney in vn. But when I inquire with the international business foundation they seen to be oblivious. I have a call in to my council back home but, there&#x27;s certainly no guarantees they know what&#x27;s best here.
 Any business owners might be able to perhaps give me the correct term for such a lawyer in vnmese?

                              <span>Hey everything, I&#x27;m thinking of doing the Ha Giang loop on a motorbike in north Vietnam in the next couple of weeks. Originally I was thinking of doing it without a guide, because I want the freedom to explore and maybe do some hiking. However, talking to a few people has made me think it might be better to do it guided, most likely with Jasmine Hostel. Does anyone here have experience with the pros and cons of each? 
 Personally I like the idea of doing it without a guide because I have more freedom to stop and take pictures, explore off the beaten path, do some hiking, and stay longer than 3 nights if I want to. The pros of doing it guided is the social aspect, staying at the best homestays, and the guides knowing the best views and all that. 
 Any feedback or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks I&#x27;m advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand more Vietnamese and Vietnamese culture and I wonder what films and TV shows feel like touchstones of the culture. Not necessarily &quot;best films or shows&quot; in terms of production or even storytelling, but the things that would make you feel more connected to Vietnam or Vietnamese culture if you were abroad.

                              <span>Hey I am off to Vietnam again in June. I have previously done a street food tour in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. This time I am focusing on Hoi an/Danang and Nha Trang. Which would be the best town to have a street food tour. We aren&#x27;t really into seafood. We have already done the Red Bridge cooking class twice. Are there any other companies that do this. Nha Trang or Danang/Hoi an.

                              <span>I figured I&#x27;d put this here as it is more of a specialist recipe compared to the scope of a more generalist subreddit like r/cooking, and the Vietnamese food subs are not exactly what could be called active or even semi active. 
 So I have seen various Vietnamese style grilled eel recipes (example: Chargrilled eel in lemongrass and turmeric (luon nuong xa) recipe : SBS Food) that are very much tickling my fancy. I&#x27;ve thought up a cooking method that sounds to me like it would give good results, but it&#x27;s not something I have ever seen suggested anywhere else so I have no idea whether it would work.
 Specifically, what I am thinking about is pre-cooking the eel before grilling it by poaching in nuoc cham, and then finishing on the grill. What I hope to accomplish with this is: 
 -Getting flavor throughout the eel without having to worry about prematurely denaturing the proteins by using the nuoc cham as the poaching liquid. The lime juice in nuoc cham would do that if the eel was raw, but would not if it was just the cooking liquid because the eel would be cooked before denaturing could happen.
 I also intend to pierce the eel with a fork to get even more flavor throughout, if need be.
 -Setting the stage for a caramelized, crispy finish. The sugars in nuoc cham would be all over the meat and allow for good caramelization.
 As I said though I&#x27;ve never seen this suggested before, so I have troubleshooting questions. Specifically:
 -My primary question: will poaching in nuoc cham make the eel TOO strongly flavored? I like my food a bit more strongly seasoned than most, but as nuoc cham is so strong, I would be cautious about overflavoring here.
 -Would the sugar content end up to more rapid burning than expected when finishing on the grill? I absolutely abhor burnt food so a heads up warning if it is a fine line would be much appreciated.
 Thank you so much and I can&#x27;t wait to branch out to this area of Vietnam&#x27;s cuisine!

                              <span>Is given name a combination of First Name + middle name? Or is it backwards, middle + first?
 For example: my spouses passport given name says Thi Dan Tam, so does that mean that her first name is actually Thi, and middle name is Dan Tam?
 She goes by Tam so I’m not sure if the vietnamese passport just had a different given name format from the usual American passport
 My US Passports given name format is First + Middle.. so this is why I’m a little confused.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 Looking for low rise apartments or houses etc in D7. I am claustrophobic and can’t go in elevators so the place needs to be accessible by stairs. Also small dog friendly. Any thoughts? Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all, a friend and I are flying into Ho chi minh at the end of March. We&#x27;ve roughly planned to spend 10 - 14 days in Vietnam before heading to phuket (probably flying out of Hanoi). It&#x27;s only my second ever overseas trip, I just have no idea how to go about it. Out of convenience (we will have suitcases) I&#x27;ve planned to stay roughly a week in Ho Chi Minh, explore the surroundings then fly to Hanoi and stay there roughly a week and explore surroundings. I&#x27;m just not sure if this is the right way to go about it, I feel like we would be missing out on a lot of stuff if we are just sticking around the main cities. Would it be better to just spend a few days in Ho Chi Minh then head north a few hours each day by car and stay somewhere new every night or every couple of nights? I&#x27;d love any suggestions on some good accomodation, sights to see and just any must do activities while in Vietnam. We love all natural wonders such as mountains, national parks, rivers ect but also want to have some time just exploring and hanging out in the cities and experiencing some night life. Taking all suggestions into consideration and any rough itineraries are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

 Reminder that a new adaptation of the story is on VTV3 today (8pm Thursday). I thought people learning Vietnamese might be interested. For many others, reading this brings back sweet childhood memory.

                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;m going to finally visit Vietnam right in the beginning of May. I&#x27;m planning to spend about 2 weeks in the country, starting from the north and making my way down to Ho Chi Min city and than flying back home. 
 I was wondering how bad would the weather be? I understand it&#x27;s the wet season and not the optimal time to visit but that&#x27;s my only option, unfortunately. Is it still a viable option at that time of the year?
 Thank you all very much!

I recently posted about assessing the value of a house but after some initial negotiations with the family in Vietnam, I might need legal representation to get the the proper amount that I’m owed by law. 
 My Vietnamese isn’t good so I can’t do a very good job finding and talking to one. Plus I don’t know if there’s an bar association I can use to verify accreditation. 
 Would love to get your thoughts and suggestions. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, i will be going to Vietnam in February and will be staying staying in can tho for a few months as an intern. I will have 1 week to travel across the country (thinking about the north of Vietnam). I would like some advice about things to visit in the south while i am staying in the mekong Delta and what places I should visit when I travel across the country. As this is my first time going to Vietnam, some general advice is also appreciated.

                              <span>I need to travel tomorrow from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh, but there are no busses or trains available. I’m thinking of going by taxi, but I do not know what service I can trust. Because it is a lot of money I don’t want to be scammed. Any help with this?
 Any tips and help will be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Some Vietnamese make the V sign when I take photos.

 So does it mean V for Vietnam?
 Or 2 pronounced like hi as some online sources say?

                              <span>Chào các bạn /Hello everyone. I’m a US citizen who has recently moved to Vietnam to be with my wife. We met years ago and have been dating for a few years before we got married, and I have finally just dropped everything and moved to Vietnam to be with her. I’m still working on my bachelors degree, but I have a couple years of experience as a professional Vietnamese-English interpreter. I desperately need a job and it has been hard to find something so far. If anyone knows a local job that would work, or even a US based job that I can do remotely, I’d really appreciate it!

                              <span>Hi, can anyone recommend a shipping company from HCMC to USA. Large 50 kilo boxes? Does not need to be expressed, sea freight is fine.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am travelling to Vietnam very soon. In the UK I can get 25,000 VND for 1 GBP (21,000 VND for 1 USD). 
 Does anyone know the rate I could get in HCMC. 
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Viet Kieu living in Vietnam at the moment, and part of several Facebook groups of women, including single women. I&#x27;m seeing more and more women decided to skip matching with white foreigners on dating apps like Bumble. Members in the group share &quot;sexual escapades&quot; by white foreigners in Thailand, which recently tighten their immigration policies, and cause a lot of them to &quot;flee&quot; to other SEA countries like Vietnam. Bald white guys in their 30s are the most obvious skip for these girls, and they are well informed of the LBH that are here on working visas. The language barrier is also another issue they mention, where it&#x27;s exhausting to use Google translate for every little thing. Many of them share stories of them being coerced into sex by these men, even on first date.
 I&#x27;m not really surprised to hear all these stories from Viet girls in both Saigon and Hanoi, and I also translate and share a few of these creeps&#x27; posts from reddit on Facebook. Ever since the pandemic Viet people seem to be more wary of white foreigners (they seem more receptive to Koreans and other Asians)
 Of course, some of the more malicious girls like to take these naive foreigners on a wild ride with expensive dates then ditch them.

                              <span>Vietnamese American here, I&#x27;m doing research on all the different fox spirits across asia and while China, Japan, and Korea&#x27;s nine tailed foxes seem to have plenty of sources online that I can look at, there&#x27;s barely any for vietnam&#x27;s, and my best source thus far for the ho ly tinh has been wikipedia but even its wikipedia page says that it needs more citations and more reliable resources. So I wanted to ask here to see what y&#x27;all know about it and preferably if you could also point me in the direction of any sources(preferred is english because I don&#x27;t know how to read or type vietnamese but I can make do with google translate.) 
 I also wanted to ask how people in vietnam generally view the creature.
 In China and Japan they range from pure evil, to harmless pranksters, to very kind and benevolent beings.
 In Korea, they are seen as purely malevolent creatures
 So I wanted to know how Vietnam generally views them. Do they range from being good to evil? Or are they just evil?
 What powers do they have, generally speaking?
 And the most important one is, how do they get their many tails? Is it just through age? Or do they do something special to get their tails? 
 I&#x27;ve wanted to reconnect with my culture now and I want to do it with my life long passion for mythology. Thank you in advance for any help!

                              <span>Hi - I&#x27;m booking SYD - CDG (return) via HAN direct with VA (website). I noticed last night the layover/connection time is 105 minutes. I can find info on their domestic connections but not on international. Can anyone that&#x27;s flown international thru Hanoi, or that knows how it works there, let me know if 1hr 45 is enough time? I assume as with other airlines they&#x27;ll transit the luggage, i.e., I won&#x27;t have to go to baggage, pick it up and transit it through. Is this also correct? Thanks.

                              <span>Dumb question but I am extremely puzzled. All the toilets here have a bidet for washing ones ass after taking a dump. They are manual bidets - basically a garden hose to spray up ones rectum. However, this can&#x27;t remove everything cleanly. I&#x27;ve gotten around this by carrying tissues with me and doing a combination of the bidet and paper wipes. Are people just sitting on the toilet and spraying nonstop until everything is cleaned? Are people just walking around with chocolate fudge in their rectums all day? I need to know!

                              <span>Just wanted to rave and spread positivity... But i moved to Vietnam in late 2017 and been here ever since.. First 2 years was a growing period, but after the 3rd year, i&#x27;ve come to fall in love with this country so much. I love Hcmc/Saigon, love the weather, the food, the people.... Happy New year and God bless!

                              <span>Hey there I&#x27;m asking for my grandfather who was a former ARVN captain if he returned to Vietnam to visit would he be arrested or persecuted for what he was apart of?
 He escaped after the fall of South Vietnam and is thinking of returning but is afraid of the government sending him to jail or give him a hard time.
 Any advice from all people would be great, thanks.
 Also happy tet!

                              <span>I moved to Hanoi last summer and honestly I’ve had a terrible experience, I was sexually assaulted in the first week of arriving and I’m still dealing with the police beaurocracy regarding that. Had a breakup of my 2 year relationship, with the person I moved over to Vietnam with and subsequently lost my job due to needing time off to process that. In addition to these personal things, the pollution bothers me and I still haven’t yet mastered driving a motorbike because I had a pretty nasty crash which has put me off for the time being. 
 In my head I’m imagining a move to HCM to be much better, I previously lived in Shanghai and I do prefer the feeling of a big metropolis - but I guess the problems with traffic are even worse there? I’ve struggled to find contemporary art and music events, and it seems like there is more of that type of thing in HCM. 
 Or do I have completely the wrong idea? Should I move somewhere else entirely? I can’t feasibly leave Vietnam for another year because I really need to make back the money I spent on document legalisation etc to get here 
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>Hello,
 We have a house in D3 3 floors high easy access to D1 we would like to add 2/3 more floors along with rooftop terrace.
 Due to the cost of the house I assume the way they charge is based on sq meter for that area? Has any foreigners ever did this of so how much did you spend? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I am going on a 2 week holiday to vietnam. Really looking forward to it.
 I am receiving injections for typhoid, hep a, diphtheria and tetanus. 
 However I am considering getting the rabies vaccine. I am going to the tourist hotspots and won’t be doing any animal related activities. 
 Has anyone else here got the rabies vaccine before living/ travelling in vietnam? Thanks

                              <span>Foreigner here. I go to my wife&#x27;s hometown pretty often, so for the last four years, I&#x27;ve joined in a lot of celebrations and ran into a lot of the same faces. The &quot;anh&quot;s and &quot;chú&quot;s still really like to drink with me and I&#x27;m always sort of a VIP at gatherings despite being more of an introvert and not good in large gatherings.
 My problem: a lot of these guys think it&#x27;s so fun to ask me what their names are in front of everyone, and more often than not, I don&#x27;t remember. It&#x27;s always the same super embarrassing moment when I&#x27;m racking my brain to think of this guy&#x27;s name while everyone is either cringing or laughing at me. And then they tell me their name but because I&#x27;m so mortified, I just can&#x27;t even remember it later even if I make a mental note. My Vietnamese is intermediate, but a lot of these guys in the village have names that I don&#x27;t know the meanings of, so hard to draw connections...
 This is why gatherings in my wife&#x27;s hometown are not fun for me. I&#x27;m always on edge, and when I sit down around a &quot;mâm&quot;, I need to look around and see if there&#x27;s anyone I don&#x27;t know or remember and try to listen for their name in conversation. 
 So what should I do to stop looking like such an asshole who can&#x27;t be bothered to learn people&#x27;s name and how to better diffuse the situation when it inevitably happens that I don&#x27;t know a name?

                              <span>Wow... this is probably an impossible question to answer, but we&#x27;re planning our 2 week trip to Vietnam March 7-21 and after accounting for Hanoi (3ish days), Hoi An (3ish days), Ninh Binh (2ish days), I feel like we can only include 1 of these &#x27;adventure&#x27; places to not feel rushed. If you HAD to pick 1 (maaaybe 2) of these experiences, what&#x27;s your pick?
 3ish days to trek in Sapa
 4 days motorbiking the Ha Giang Loop
 3 days with a guided cave expedition in Phong Nha
 3 days motorbiking/trekking in Dalat
 Some background info: my wife and I are in our late 20&#x27;s and love combining city life, food, culture, and nature/adventure on our trips. If anything, it&#x27;s hard for us to &#x27;chill&#x27; and slow down while traveling, but we&#x27;re certainly trying to embody that on this trip more than others :)

                              <span>I plan to live in Vietnam for 6 months later this year, and hope to bring my cat with me. I will be flying from Canada to Vietnam. With a brief google search I&#x27;ve found that as long as my cat fits in a carry on bag under my seat, has her rabies shot, documents with her history of vaccines, and a vet approved letter she should be able to fly and enter the country with me. 
 I&#x27;d love to know if anyone can share their experience travelling with a pet to Vietnam and if I am missing any information. Thank you!

                              <span>I will be traveling to Nha Trang for the first time in October. What are some things that are a must know? (things to do, travel suggestions for first-timers, things to avoid) 
 I am from the USA, so I am nervous about culturally offending locals from my ignorance, so I want to study up on some basic things to do or not to do. Thank you!

 Would you retire in Vietnam and why?

                              <span>Hello! Please help me (39F and Canadian) do something kind for my Vietnamese immigrant neighbours (late 20s M/F and 3F) for Lunar New Year tomorrow.
 They are such good neighbours! They made me pho when I had surgery and they feed my children homemade spring rolls. One time the Ba Noi was visiting from Vietnam and she made me shrimp in banana leaves but I didn’t know how to eat it. I tried to ask the Ba Noi but she doesn’t speak English so I just tried to take a bite out of the banana leaf. The Ba Noi laughed and laughed and showed me how to unwrap them and eat the shrimp.
 Their little 3F comes over to play with my kids almost every day and we just love her so much. Her parents work so hard — six days a week and long hours. They are such good people and I’m so happy to know them. 
 Anyhow, tomorrow is Lunar New Year and I know they usually have a big party with their Vietnamese friends and set off fireworks. 
 I read that usually you give gifts of money in red envelopes for Lunar New Year. Would that be appropriate for me, their white Canadian neighbour, to bring over tomorrow?
 My two concerns are that I don’t want them to feel that they have to invite me to their party, reciprocate the gift or make them uncomfortable. Also I don’t want to accidentally do something unlucky.
 Thank you Reddit for any advice you can give me!

                              <span>On behalf of the mod team of r/Vietnam, I would like to send you greetings for the Luna New Year, the year of the Cat! Wishing you a year fully loaded with happiness, good health, wealth and luck.
 Thank you for participating in r/Vietnam and keep the sub going daily. 
 I would also like to send special thanks to the members who have volunteered to spend their time and effort answering a lot of questions in the sub every day, whether it&#x27;s easy or difficult. You are the heroes who don&#x27;t wear capes, and I&#x27;m really, really grateful for having you guys here!
 Thay mặt cho mod team của r/Vietnam, mình xin gửi lời chúc mừng năm mới tới tất cả các thành viên của sub! Chúc mọi người một năm Quý Mão ngập tràn hạnh phúc, tài lộc, và may mắn!
 Cảm ơn các bạn đã tham gia vào sub và giữ cho nó hoạt động hàng ngày.
 Mình cũng rất biết ơn những thành viên đã tình nguyện bỏ thời gian công sức của các bạn ra để trả lời vô số câu hỏi được gửi vào sub mỗi ngày. Cảm ơn rất nhiều những đóng góp thầm lặng của các bạn.
 P/S: Sorry if the sub seems a bit messy these days. Like other Vietnamese, I also have to prepare for Tet and enjoy the holiday with my family. Will come back to clean up the sub after a few days :P

                              <span>We are considering a month summer trip on the Vietnam SE coast. Potentially flying into Denang and spending a week in Hoi An and then maybe flying or night bus/train to Nha Trang and staying there for 3 weeks for relaxing beach time. 
 I’ve read you can’t rent a car in Vietnam and we would not feel comfortable riding scooters with our kid (or even probably just an adult 🤣). 
 The places I’m looking at to stay are not in the city center so we can have more space and a pool. We already live in a high rise in a big SE Asian city, so I’d prefer a villa experience while on vacation. 
 My husband thinks having to use Grab multiple time a day if you want to grocery shop, eat out, visit a different beach will be a huge hassle and the cost will add up. This feels like a dealbreaker to him and he thinks we should scrap the Vietnam idea and go to a different country. :(. I read about hiring a car with driver for a few weeks. This sounds pretty weird to me and maybe awkward, but I figured I need to explore this option.
 How do you find a trusted driver like that? Through your villa rental management staff or is their a reputable company people use? I’ve read about scams where drivers will try to take you to restaurants or tours that give them a commission, which I want to avoid. 
 TIA!

                              <span>My Vietnamese fiancé (25F) and I (30M) are getting married in the UK in a few months. She has a marriage visa for the UK and we’ve done our notice of marriage with our local government. The Registar said that we need to get paperwork from the Vietnam Embassy in London. Looking online and the only information I can find is for if we are getting married in Vietnam. 
 Anyone with experience in the area, your insight would be greatly appreciated! TIA

                              <span>Hey all, we&#x27;re travelling to Vietnam with our two kids (one is two years old and one is four months) in mid Feb, for three weeks. Are there any things we absolutely must see?
 Current plan is to fly in and out of HCMC, travelling up the country between, with potential stops in Hoi An, Hanoi, and maybe Phu Quoc. But suggestions are very much welcome!

                              <span>Anyone watched the popular anime Fruits Basket? (also a popular manga). The story is about the twelve animals and the cat. Only the Vienmames zodiac does justice to our wonderful meow friends. 😺

                              <span>I’m a first-year college student from the States studying geographic information systems and computer science. My university has a study abroad program with RMIT Vietnam that I’m interested in and was wondering how good the university is regarding their curriculum and class settings. I’m set to graduate a year early within my degree plan as I’ve earned many college credits during high school and I want to have an opportunity to go out of the States to study abroad during my 3 years in college.
 How are the programs or courses in information technology and computer science there? Most importantly, what’s the outlook like with the tech or CS industry in Vietnam as I’m interested in networking around as well. I’m looking at doing a semester worth of courses, so any insights about university life and studies revolving around the RMIT campus or Vietnam in general are highly appreciated.

                              <span>I am really amazed so I had to make a post. Not sure if it’s the hot climate or the travel jitters or something else, but I just have trouble finishing my meals here
 Vegetable Spring rolls look tiny, but somehow I already feel full after eating just a couple. Bánh mì is another one - just half a sandwich and I’m already satisfied. And don’t get me started on the pho or bun bo hue - I think it would take me two full days to finish one bowl
 Back home I could easily devour several slices of pizza and still be hungry, so not sure why Vietnamese food is filling me up so quickly lol

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I applied for visa through them thinking they were government official site (gov.vn) and received the e-visa about a week later. I then asked a question about how my name appears on the e-visa (last,first, middle vs. last, middle,first) and got no response. It’s been a week since. I read the on the embassy website that visas done by third party may not be legit and can result in entrance refusal. Anyone has experience with this site or this kind of service? Thanks

                              <span>Hi! Does anyone know if it is legal to bring in Velo Nicotine pouches to Vietnam? I have just ordered 25 cans to DaNang. 
 Otherwise, do you know any place or person from where to buy snus/nicotine pouches around DaNang? 
 Thanks!

 sorry for the question, google only provides results from 9+ years ago and we haven&#x27;t traveled in the last three years.

 Am asking the locals here and also any expats in case I miss anything.
 It can be places to visit, foods, history, anecdotes or anything that can be interesting.
 Want to keep first impressions fresh and stir the curiosity of anyone who might be interested in visiting.
 Serious replies please and open to suggestions.
 P.S: Let me know what I should avoid photographing or filming if anything.

                              <span>Hi all, I am planning a trip of about 3/4 weeks in Vietnam and I would like to travel the whole country from north to south (or maybe the other way around).
 Because of work, the only times I can take a full 3 to 4 weeks is either August or end of December/beginning of January around the Christmas holidays. I seem to understand that both these times are not ideal from a weather point of view.
 I have been researching quite a bit and if I got it right it looks like I am going to risk typhoons in the north in August; while December is quite cold in the north and very rainy in the central area of Hue and Hoi An.
 Unfortunately I cannot get around these two times of the year, so I was wondering if you have any suggestions. Maybe some of you have been in August or December and can let me know if it&#x27;s really risky to the point of having the whole trip ruined by weather?
 I am somewhat tending towards December. Can you enjoy the cruise in Halong Bay at this time or is it too cold and foggy?
 Thanks so much for any tip you may want to give me! :)

                              <span>We’ve been using a Vietnamese supplier exporting products to me abroad and recently their quality has gone down with the most recent completely faulty and unusable. 
 I’m also certain they’re cheating taxes making me so weird things sending to their personal accounts instead of their business bank account. 
 What are my options. They refuse to refund me. I’m a small business and it’s really going to hurt me if they won’t refund me. 
 Thanks in advance.

 I am backpacking Vietnam in February/March, starting in Hanoi and then settling in HCMC to work.
 What would be best for me to buy travelling wise when I get to Vietnam, rather than here in the UK, to potentially save money?
 I know its a broad question so I do apologise but anyone with experience etc the help would be much much appreciated :)

                              <span>Hi! I am trying to find some funny jokes that will help me better understand the humor. From my research it seems the North vietnamese culture has a lot of wordplay jokes, and the South favors slapstick comedy. What are some of your favorite jokes, and if you could also explain in English why they are funny that would help a lot, too! I am a total beginner in my learning of the language. Thank you to everyone who shares :)

                              <span>As a foreigner here that has a deep love for Vietnam and its culture, i always felt it was important to learn the language. My Vietnamese is ok, but it could, should and one day will be much better! 
 My honest question is though ... Why do so many Vietnamese people make it so hard to learn the language? By this i mean, if I say something wrong in Thai or Khmer, or Italian, I am corrected and helped. In Vietnam, they just give you the &quot;wavy hands&quot; or worse still laugh!
 When Vietnamese speak English to me, much of it is wrong, but I appreciate that they are trying and I &quot;autocorrect&quot; what they said in my head, so as to not embarrass them and then I answer them. The same cannot be said the other way. 
 I really am not meaning to be rude, but why do many Vietnamese (I appreciate it not all) simply try to help me, by autocorrecting and helping me to speak better? 
 Many thanks for all your help!

                              <span>As someone who works in football here in Vietnam (and across Asia) as a foreigner Vietnamese football is as fascinating as much as it is infuriating.
 Like most leagues and countries there are issues with corruption, greed and self interest. But what really gets me with Vietnam is the MASSIVE potential for the sport, the huge love for the support... but the terrible attendances to league games.
 Sure there are issues with marketing, match fixing, poor kick off times, poor product and more... but I would like to ask the Vietnamese in this group, and those that live here... What are the issues YOU see in Vietnamese football and how would you change them to make things better? Thanks!

                              <span>For clarity - I&#x27;m trying to understand the motivations of the Southern Vietnamese people during the war. 
 I understand the Catholics, land owners, and capitalists. They would obviously side with Western ideals.
 But it doesn&#x27;t explain the Buddhist majority, or the majority of people who were not that wealthy. Why did they fight with the U.S. against Ho Chi Minh? Can anyone shed some light on this issue? What were their motivations and beliefs?
 Every time I try to read about this I get the U.S. and International perspective. But I never understand what was happening with the actual Vietnamese people there.

                              <span>My girlfriend has been telling me about Lunar New Year. She grew up in Vietnam, we both currently live in the US (I&#x27;m white). I want to give her one of the red envelopes with lucky money but I don&#x27;t know how much to give. I&#x27;m 3 years older than her if that&#x27;s relevant. She said her lucky numbers are 6 and 8 so does it make sense to give her like $8? From what I&#x27;ve read it seems like the amount isn&#x27;t supposed to be a lot but I don&#x27;t want to be insensitive to her culture by giving too much or too little.

 I have all the details of the business and the person. Also got his pictures.
 An update: A local informant has stated, it&#x27;s possible that he filed bankruptcy.

                              <span>Hi all. My girlfriend is from Vietnam and she usually gets pretty homesick around this time of year for obvious reasons. I’m trying to think of a nice way for us to do something on Saturday night to celebrate. It’s our second Tết together, last year we did some basic decorating but it was hard to find anything good around where we are. She made some traditional food as well. This year I want to surprise her with something nice but don’t know what to do. Any ideas? Even something simple would be fine I think.

                              <span>Hello fellow Redditors,
 I am a 47-year-old Belgian man who has had the pleasure of visiting Vietnam 12 times, spending a total of 16 months there. Through my interactions with the South Vietnamese community where I live, as well as my multiple visits and online relationships, I have become fluent in speaking and writing in Vietnamese. In fact, when a native Vietnamese speaker hears me on the phone, they often mistake me for a Vietnamese person. In addition to my fluency in Vietnamese, I also speak French, Dutch and English, and have a basic understanding of German.
 My dream is to find a job in South Vietnam, but I am facing a bit of a hurdle. I have been working for the government since 1996 and therefore do not have any other qualifications beyond my high school diploma. Additionally, I have no concrete proof of the skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout my career. However, I am skilled in working with computers and have strong communication abilities. My current job involves designing templates that are sent to millions of citizens, but the software I use is not utilized by any companies in Vietnam.
 I am willing to accept a salary that is typical for Vietnam, as money is not a concern for me. My only qualifications are my high school diploma and my work experience, so my CV is essentially my career. I am open to any job, but I am unsure of the best course of action. Should I try to find a job while on a tourist visa and do visa runs until I secure employment? Or, should I enroll in a school in Ho Chi Minh City in order to obtain a student visa? I believe my English and Vietnamese language abilities are sufficient to pass any necessary tests, and I am eager to immerse myself in the educational experience.
 All I know is that I am happiest when I am in Vietnam, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to make my dream a reality. Thank you for reading and for your responses.

                              <span>With Tet almost here, this may seem like a silly question or I may be over thinking this a bit. 
 For context I am a Vietnamese Canadian living in Canada, a little over a month ago I had came back from my Vietnam trip and had matched on bumble with this girl from Vietnam. Long story short ever since then I&#x27;ve been feeling some type of way towards her (in a good way not a bad way).
 Growing up in Canada I&#x27;ve never really had the need to say new year wishes in Vietnamese to my other friends here but rather just my grandparents and parents. So I&#x27;m used to saying things like chúc mừng năm mới.. or con chúc ông bà nhiều xúc khỏe song lâu tram tuoi etc. 
 So my question is are there any ideas on how I can send her new year wishes without just the plain chúc mừng năm mới? In other words what are some ways to send wishes from friend to friend. 
 From the top of my head in the context of friend to friend, I can only think of wishing for good health, happiness and lots of money. 
 Apologies if this question came out kind of odd or if i&#x27;m overthinking it.

The UK government suggested I need to bring a prescription and a letter from my doctor, but they can be overzealous. I&#x27;d rather be cautious though !

                              <span>Hi, I study in Hanoi for the semester, and I&#x27;m in Sài Gòn for a week, and every Vietnamese I know told me Sài Gòn is just good for food and clubbing, nothing to visit (their words). So what typical/hard to find elsewhere food can I eat here and where in the city? I already tried hủ tiếu, bánh mí chảo and Bánh tráng trộn, they were all great. (if by any luck you know a good place to visit, share with us :)))

                              <span>My wife and I are visiting VN from March 8-26th. Where we are flying into and out is still in the air depending on the itinerary. I&#x27;m a 41 Hue refugee that at 2 months old we escaped from VN to Hong Kong then Philippines then CA, US. I have never been back, and the plan was to visit in 2020 but covid hit. Now is the time. Super excited. Minus traveling days we should have 16 full days.
 Here are the places I wanted to visit: Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Long bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An.
 Originally we wanted to fly into Saigon then fly into Da Nang and make our way up north and fly home from Hanoi. However after watching vids on youtube and reading, wondering if we should just skip Saigon and spread say 2 days to the cities mentioned above. Is it worth visiting giving our amount of days in VN? I&#x27;ve heard people say they wouldn&#x27;t have been sad if they skip it while others say it&#x27;s a must visit. Also how many days of each cities is sufficient.
 Any suggestions would be helpful. thank you.

                              <span>I used to study abroad in a different country and met a Vietnamese girl there. We hit it off and got into a relationship. I visited her twice in Vietnam and on the second visit found out she had been cheating on me through snooping. I need the help from someone to figure out what was said by her in her texts so I know what happened exactly. I believe this will give me some peace. I have quite a lot of texts. Is anybody willing to help me?

                              <span>I will be visiting VN next month from Canada. I heard you get a better rate for money exchange if you bring brand new $100 CAD bills as opposed to old $100 CAD bills. Is this true ? Also, where is the best place for money exchange in District 4 of HCMC?

                              <span>Hi Everyone
 I am hoping this is the right place to ask.
 I am currently trying to buy a few products from Vietnam (essentially coffee, that i am not able to find in France or at 5x time the price). I am wondering if someone could help locally or if you know a proxy buying service dedicated to that?
 Most of the Vietnamese website i have tried don’t deliver abroad.
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m from Germany and my gf and her family are from Hanoi. As I have a genuine personal interest in history in general and Vietnamese history in particular, I would like to ask my parents-in-law about their experiences in the American War.
 They are in their early 70s and I know he was a soldier in the NVA. Would it be acceptable to bring this topic up in a respectful way and in an appropriate setting (e.g. during a one-on-one conversation while going for a walk, not at the family dinner table)?
 I&#x27;m asking because - unsurprisingly - WWII is still a touchy topic in Germany. But these two wars are obviously very different, with Germany being the aggressor and committing genocide. My own grandparents never talkes about WWII, although the topic was still always weirdly present in the background.
 I&#x27;ve done a bit of reading beforehand (Last Night I Dreamed of Peace by Đặng Thùy Trâm, The Sorrow of War by Bảo Ninh, The Peguin History of Modern Vietnam by Christopher Goscha) and watched the Ken Burns documentary about the War, so I wouldn&#x27;t be totally ignorant and ask dumb/insensitive questions.

                              <span>Grandfather is name Tuat Van Nguyen born in Hanoi, Vietnam and I believe he grew up in Hanoi, where he was kidnapped on his way to Catholic school. His father was a locksmith. This is all I can gather from him as it is it is a very sensitive topic. We are heading back to Vietnam to search for his parents, or any members of his family, in Saigon and then making our way to Hanoi. I am hoping I can get a head start with some search tips online. It seems the best way to go searching for this would be to look at church records but unfortunately, I need help on the ground. Or any sort of obituary. He seemed to recall one sister. Would it be worth hiring a private investigator? This time we&#x27;re going back in April. I am his first granddaughter 33 years old and will accompany him.
 Both his grandparents lived in Thai Binh, and he lived there with them before he went to school in Hanoi with his parents.
 His father, Yet Van Nguyen
 Mother, Do Thi Nguyen
 Grandfather, Tuat Van Nguyen born 07/15/1935. He did spend some time in Paris, I think when he was about in his 20s. Someone took him under his wing but he left back to Vietnam to search again.

                              <span>Hi everyone - I&#x27;ve spent the last few days combing through all your posts on traveling Vietnam, lots of helpful stuff so thanks to everyone. Currently planning on flying to Hanoi mid Sept, spending a couple days there and bussing to Ha Giang, doing the loop on motorbike then coming back. 
 My bday is at the end of the trip and I&#x27;d like to splurge a little at a luxury-ish resort or something where I can really chill out and be taken care of. From what I&#x27;ve read so far, current top of the list is Da Nang, but just wanted to see if anyone has any other good recs. 
 Wants
 -Remote-ish, not overly touristy but still some kind of town action we can walk to for food, beers, etc.
 -Resort with a pool, preferably overlooking the beach
 -Proximity to other towns/beaches so we can rent scooters and go on little day trips
 Recommendations on Towns or actual resorts would be amazing!
