                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I was born and raised in America. Both of my parents are Việt Kiều, and gave me the opportunity to study and practice the language, so I am fluent but by no means a professional. I just came back from Vietnam, and a lot of locals told me that my Vietnamese is correct, but that they know I am a foreigner because my way of speaking sounds &quot;lớ lớ.&quot; Their English is limited, so I couldn&#x27;t understand when they tried to explain what the phrase means. Any help appreciated, cảm ơn!

                              <span>Hi everybody, thought I would do a small post regarding some thoughts and observations since I&#x27;ve been here, would love to hear what you guys have to say. Here for a month from Australia, South to North. Currently in Ho Chi Minh/Saigon. 
 - Cleanliness; The CBD/City centre is insanely clean? I saw almost no rubbish at at all, and the rate of construction and urban development has blown me away. I&#x27;m unsure if its just buildings for show but it looks great. Some outer suburbs reminded me of other parts of Asia i&#x27;ve been in but that is correlated to a lower socio-economic situation obviously. 
 - Food; I&#x27;ve tried both street &amp; restaurant food, it is absolutely delicious and extremely cheap, I can see what the hype is about.
 - People; People have been friendly mostly smiles and what not, serv…</span>

Does any one know if using Vietjet air for both flights I need to do check in again in the Vietnam airport changing flights? Or can they do check in when I am taking first flight for both flights? I am worried not to make it to next flight if I need to do check in again, plus I would need to get visa to enter Vietnam.

 Does anyone know the name of this exact remix of Khong Phai at 25:02 in this DJ set? https://youtu.be/i9mCWpytHfA?t&#x3D;1502 
 I hope it&#x27;s not a remix by the DJ themselves. I&#x27;ve been listening to this set a lot and it&#x27;s definitely my favourite part! 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am quite worried. Please help.
 I’m a dual-citizen: Armenian and American. I arrived into Laos today from Thailand with my Armenian passport and I had a visa for it. The border patrol rejected my entry because they wanted me to get into Laos using my American passport given that I got Thai entry/exit stamps in that passport. So I had to reapply with a visa on arrival using my American passport. This caught me by surprise because I’ve switched my passport several times while visiting countries and it has never been a problem.
 AND I’m going to Vietnam in 2 days and I have a visa approval for Vietnam under my Armenian passport again. A worker at Laos’ immigration said it’s fine if I enter Vietnam and that the rules are different but I want to be sure. Vietnamese consulates in Laos are closed for the weekend and I can’t get help from anyone. Does anyone have more information about this? Does Vietnam allow passport swapping?
 Note: there’s no visa on arrival for Armenians or Americans.

                              <span>Have been listening to Den Vau wowy and binz this past year and I honestly think Den Vau is in a league of his own. Also curious if there’s anyone who raps and story tells like he does.
 Id say he’s the Kendrick Lamar /Jcole for Vietnam in terms of rappers but open to suggestion to see if there’s anyone better.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ll be moving there for work and have tried searching for more info but haven&#x27;t had much luck besides the basics.
 - What is rent like (cheap or affordable)?
 - Is it local or a mix with foreigners?
 - What&#x27;s the commute like to D1 or D2?
 - Is there a nightlife?
 - Are there many gyms? I wanted to look into learning mixed martial arts...any options there?
 - Is it busy (traffic/noise etc.)
 Overall, what should I expect? Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: thanks for answering my questions!

                              <span>When I first came here, I loved it and openly spoke on TV and media about how great it is here. The people were great, everyone had a huge &quot;togetherness&quot; spirit when COVID started.. Now.... I absolutely hate it. Everyone, every day, is trying to screw each other over. Old people are vile and rude as fuck, acting like a bunch of gorillas. Everyone has an agenda. Companies are dishonest. People try to kill you on the road and act cowardly when confronted. When I came here, I was on TV talking about how great Vietnam is, but I&#x27;ve never in my life been tricked, lied to or screwed over as much as here. I am deeply depressed and miserable. HOWEVER, I am trying to reconnect with the reasons why I loved this place. One last ditch effort to regain happiness here.. maybe some of you can help me re-ignite that spark again. What is it that you like about living here? EDIT: I&#x27;ve been here 3 years

                              <span>Rant: I&#x27;m out today and the air quality is just so bad, literally afraid to inhale. It gets worse over the year and I see no sign of the government trying to do anything about it. In a decade I can only imagine what devastating public health disaster it will cause.

                              <span>Like title said, my gf was recently accepted to ILA and will fly to saigon in May. Her employer said she will be assigned which center to work at based on where she lives. So im looking for an apartment or room (with her own kitchen and good enough privacy) in the southern half of the city. If the location is near centers in Phú Lâm, Bình Tân, Hùng Vương, Him Lam, Nguyễn Cư Trinh or Phú Mỹ Hưng thatd be ideal. Her budget is 12 million per month and that hopefully covers everything she needs to worry about rent-wise.

                              <span>I’ve read that you’re expected to haggle the prices down, which could get you around 40% of the advertised cost, is that true? Also, is there places and things where you just pay the advertised price, like for food and drinks? It’s my first time in Vietnam, and will be staying around Old Quarter area. Any do’s and dont’s I should be aware of when shopping?🤔

                              <span>I do not think the news was already posted here, but the Michelin Guide is coming in Vietnam. First edition of the guide will be released in June.
 I think it’s a great think for Vietnam – It will help a lot the restaurants aiming to offer fine dining especially Vietnamese ones.
 What are your prognostics about the potential decorated restaurant in Vietnam?
 My opinion:
 - No 3 Stars Restaurants. I really do not think any venue in Vietnam is there yet. Bangkok does not have any 3 Stars Restaurants.
 - Anan Saigon: I really see them decorated. I tried them few years ago it was great, but it seems what they offer now is more elaborated. It’s the only restaurant in Vietnam that made to Asia’s Top 50 + their food relates a lot to Vietnam
 - I also think that the Guide will give one Star to a good Street food stall / place either in Ha Noi or HCMC. The guide did that both in Thailand (Jay bee) and Singapore. It’s a way for them to not appear too snobbish and it’s good PR…
 - Maybe one or two high end French Restaurants from Ho Chi Minh City: I have tried 3 Gourmands / La Villa / P’tit Saigon / Le Corto. All of them are great but I guess inspectors of the guide have been eating a lot in “similar” restaurants. I am just not sure if they will be &quot;good enough&quot; to get one Stars with French Cuisine. I could also add La Badiane in Ha Noi to this list.
 - One or more Japanese Restaurant? Likely – There is so many great Japanese Restaurant both in Hanoi et HCMC. I have just not tried enough of them to have an any name in mind.
 For the locals not familiar with how the Guide works ( I have seen many mistakes both on Facebook and local news sites) we wrote this article: https://amthuchiendai.vn/tat-ca-nhung-gi-can-biet-ve-cam-nang-michelin/

 Couldn&#x27;t find on Shopee/Lazada unfortunately. Thanks!
 (if not Hcmc, any othet city is as good as well)

                              <span>Hey guys! I&#x27;m a high school student doing an essay about the opinions of all HCMC residents on air pollution here. As a HCMC native, we acknowledge that air pollution do exist in HCMC. However, the opinions of each and one of us varies, more so for the opinions of different generations. My essay aims to find the relationship between age and perspective on air pollution.
 Please help a student out and fill out this survey! It only takes a few minutes at most. Thank you!
 Thesis statement: An investigation into the relationship between age and their perspective on air pollution in Ho Chi Minh City.

                              <span>Hi, quick question! I’m traveling in Vietnam right now and am currently in Hoi An. I’m supposed to fly out on the 4th to Hanoi and stay there until the 7th.
 I’m dumb and didn’t realize the 4th is the lunar festival and that Hoi An will be having lanterns float out! Is it worth it to change my dates and lose one day in Hanoi to see this festival? 
 Advice is appreciated :)

                              <span>Going to be travelling through Vietnam in April - spending 3 days in Hanoi, 3 in Hoi An and 4 in HCM. Looking to get some suits made, maybe a sweater and a coat too as well as shirts and trousers. Have heard that Hoi An is a bit of a tourist trap in this regard and wondering if there are better tailors for the same price in the other cities. Looking to spend between $150-$250 USD for suits. Anyone got any recommendations/tips? Cheers!

 We will arrive in Hanoi. What area of the city do you recommend us to stay in? Is Couchsurfing safe and popular there? 
 We want to spend some days in Hanoi and then visit other places. 
 We love food (especially street food), cultural places and nature. We would love to visit local spaces and not the big cities or touristic spots. 
 What would be your recommendations?

                              <span>Hello Everyone! Flying into Hanoi at the beginning of April and plan to spend 5 nights near Ha Long Bay. So any advice on the following will be greatly appreciated.
 Any recommended Ha Long Bay cruise companies? Im looking for luxury cruises. No budget. I already looked into Genesis and Athena. Please let me know your experiences.
 Is it recommended to stay in Cat Ba for a few nights? or Ha Long? or Hanoi? I plan to do a 2 night cruise starting my second day, so ill have 2 nights to burn. I&#x27;m looking to do some exploring but mostly want to relax. Ill most likely be flying out of Hanoi.
 Thanks for any/all advice given!

                              <span>I have been making chanh muoi for a few months and I feel like mine never matches what I really get in any restaurants. I wanted to know how other people prepared there&#x27;s to see the differences in the way I&#x27;m doing it. 
 All I&#x27;m doing is adding one piece chanh muoi to a glass, crushing and stirring it, add sugar and cold soda water. I&#x27;ll be getting superfine sugar to dissolve more easily but anything else you guys do?

I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s due to some lines being cut. Does this happen often? How long does a fix usually take??

                              <span>Hello, I would like to ask anyone who has any knowledge on the topic I wrote about in my title.
 To put it simply, I am currently filing taxes for 2022 and it asks for my marital status in which I understand that I should put Married but am unsure which type of Married filing I should put, whether separately, jointly or head of household.
 I am also working on papers to bring my wife to the US, so I don&#x27;t know if picking one of these choices is more beneficial than the other. Although, I do know that filing jointly is much more difficult and may take time to obtain certain papers.
 She does not have an income if that matters.

 A local internet service provider reported Monday that the Intra Asia (IA) cable has been encountering problems since last Saturday. There was a breakage at a cable section located about 130 km from a shoreline station in Singapore, causing a total loss of international data from Vietnam to Singapore through the IA cable.
 The latest breakage means that only one undersea cable connecting Vietnam globally, the SMW3, remains fully functional.
 Vietnam is currently connected with seven undersea cables: SMW3, AAG, IA, APG, AAE-1, SJC2 and ADC. Besides the recent breakage of the IA, problems with the AAE, AAG and APG cables tha…</span>

 (Total is 1 billion vnd/ Roughly 40k USD)
 I recently asked about it and their replies were a bit vague.
 I&#x27;ve heard some bad stories about VK and locals ripping them off.
 In your opinion how trustworthy are Vietnamese locals? What are the chances they run off with it in your opinion?
 50%? 5%?

                              <span>Anyone know of the best app to learn some Vietnamese? I tried Duolingo which seemed pretty bad for it. I’m currently using an app called Mondly, and have complete all the free stuff but now need to pay for more, so wanted to check if there was a better one before I paid. 
 Or should I be less lazy and just create my own learning cards/prompts and study the language that way?
 Thanks in advance
 Edit: I will be living in HCM so southern dialect

 A friend and I are travelling to Vietnam in two weeks. We also planned to attend a Vietnamese cooking class. How can we find/book such one half day/a few hours classes?
 Preferably in English and in HCMC (Saigon) or also Hanoi

                              <span>I am 23 and I am planning on moving to Vietnam, while doing research it is abundantly apparent that the most common job for expats is to teach English. I have no problem teaching. However, my passion is in public policy (of which I am getting a degree for it now). Unfortunately when I look for job opportunities for expats working in the government I can’t see anything. Does anyone know anything more about this? 
 Btw, I am planning to move when I finish my degree in the next few years or so.
 Edit: not looking to be an elected representative or anything. More like administrative work ie: assisting with permits/ regulations.

 Im planning to take my dad to hoi an for a month in march. I was wondering if anyone could recommend a homestay/BnB with a private room for around 300$ a month in the general old town area. would love a pool included if possible, but its not necessary. 
 THanks for your time. :)

                              <span>I just booked my first trip to Hanoi, so I’m now planning my trip and looking up places to stay and shop. Is it true that so many places are still closed?! For instance around this area where I was hoping to do some shoe shopping, I see dozens of buildings listed as such.
 8 P. Hàng Dầu, Ly Thai To, Hoàn Kiếm, Hà Nội
 I tried viewing from Google maps but seems they haven’t updated since 2014 lol I hope I haven’t picked a bad time to visit!

                              <span>Hello, I booked a round trip to Bai Chay/ Ha Long bay for one day (10.30AM- 18.30 PM) and I wanted to simply enjoy a nice view and possibly hike in a quiet place (hence the idea to spend most of the time in Cat Ba). Would I miss much by only doing that? I would be happy to do a 1/2 hrs boat tour in the bay, but all I see are expensive cruises taking a lot of time-or you know some? Any advice/link appreciated!

  People drink at a Highlands Coffee shop in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Y&#x27;all can check out more number here: Many Vietnamese spend more on drinks than main meals: report - VnExpress International 
 Another 33% of respondents are willing to spend VND20,000-40,000 on drinks, according to the survey of 3,940 consumers conducted by food and beverage market solutions firm iPOS.
 Only 14% said they would splurge more than VND70,000 for a drink, the equivalent of the price of a drink at high-end coffee shops such as Starbucks and Runam Bistro, it added.
 Nearly 54% of respondents said they visit coffee shops once to twice a month.
 I believe that the avg. hour rate in Vietnam is less than 25,000 VNĐ. How could they spend over 3 hours of working daily for a coffee?

Also, if you have a long layover (14 ish hours) can you leave the airport? And do you need a visa? Will my luggage be checked through to my final destination? From what I have read it can be a bit hit-and-miss. Thank you!

                              <span>Greetings,
 I [M, 27] will soon graduate my bachelor of Computer Science in Netherland this July. I am planning to look for a job relates to my studies in Vietnam, therefore wondering if jobs relate to AI/software are plenty to find in Vietnam. Also how much I can earn and where I can find such jobs (LinkedIn perhaps?)
 I am humbly asking for you opinions.

                              <span>Hi I was wondering whether it would be possible to cycle the Ha Giang Loop? I am planning on heading to Vietnam in the second half of August and am desperate to travel on the Ha Giang Loop but not on a motorbike and also not someone else taking me. I am a very capable cyclist but I was basically wondering if it was possible and safe? I would be happy to make it a large proportion of the trip so if there would be any safer potentially longer routes/roads? And where would be a good place to hire or purchase a good quality bike ( may be cheaper just buying) but would rather hire? I understand this is not the usual way to do the loop but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much

                              <span>I&#x27;m mid 30&#x27;s(M) going to HCMC mid February and was wondering if there are bar or nightlife areas that aren&#x27;t as crazy as Bu Vien but not super high society either. Lived in Thailand for seven years so hanging out on backpacker walking streets the majority of my nights there isnt something I wanna do, I&#x27;ll go and check it out for a bit but I&#x27;m getting a tad bit old for all night drinking sessions with pounding music but I&#x27;m also not looking for HiSo speakeasy places where I have to get dressed up lol Oddly specific question I know, was just wondering if there are areas like that, small beer bars with a pool table and the like. Dont really care if there are ladies or not, that&#x27;s not my objective but if there are it wont bother me either and faux british pubs aren&#x27;t really my thing either lol. Thanks for any suggestions

 Đúng, ta đâu cần nhất thiết phải tryhard quá mức làm gì, sống theo kiểu lying flat, chỉ làm đủ ăn, không tiêu sài hoang phí, không bị cuốn vào vòng xoáy chủ nghĩa tiêu dùng, không phải cạnh tranh, đấu đá nhiều làm gì chi cho mệt. Thì tôi nói thẳng luôn, là TÔI ĐÉ\ CHẤP NHẬN SỐNG CUỘC ĐỜI NHƯ THẾ*
 Cuộc sống này là những cuộc cạnh tranh khắc nghiệt, miễn là mà.y còn thở, thì mà.y vẫn sẽ cứ mãi tiếp tục đấu tranh (có thể hiểu theo nhiều nghĩa). 
 Cuộc sống này phức tạp hơn thế nhiều. Ngay từ khi ta học tiểu học thì đã có những cái khái niệm như điểm số, top những học sinh có điểm trung bình cao nhất lớp, hay những cuộc thi học sinh giỏi rồi. 
 Cuộc sống này luôn vận động và thay đổi theo từng …</span>

 I&#x27;m Vietnamese-American (28F) and have visited my family in Việt Nam several times. But, the last time I visited was in 2016. My husband and I are planning a long vacation in Việt Nam late summer this year and I was wondering what street fashion for young adults in their 20s is like now, for both men and women. My husband is white so he&#x27;s going to stand out no matter what, so I&#x27;m not worried about looking like I am a &quot;local&quot;, but am really just interested in how street fashion has changed since I last visited and what is commonplace now. 
 In college, I met an exchange student from Việt Nam and when he saw me wearing short running shorts, he was appalled and asked why I was wearing those. I was confused why he was so shocked and he said in Việt Nam, only prostitutes wear shorts that short (they were like...mid-thigh length). This was back in 2014, though... I have no idea how accurate that reaction was to what&#x27;s commonplace though because I&#x27;ve never been there long enough to really notice or outside of my family&#x27;s district to see much else. 
 Cảm ơn nhiều!

                              <span>What is the Vietnamese law regarding a baby born out of wedlock between a couple who is not married to each other? The couple is MARRIED to other parties. They did not divorce their married partners.
 What happens when the baby is born? Can the baby get the birth certificate? Who can apply for the birth certificate? What procedures if the father or mother of the baby apply for the birth certificate?
 The father of the baby&#x27;s Family Book is in Dong Nai and the baby&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family book is in Tay Ninh?

                              <span>hello!
 i have been searching for a country with rather cheap living costs and a nice climate. people have been suggesting the SEA countries. so, is vietnam really that cheap in 2023? most if not all countries have been hit with severe electricity ,gas, and just general goods price increase. especially europe, so im now looking for a country to maybe move to...
 also, is healthcare free in vietnam? how about job? how much is the minimum wages?

                              <span>Edit: They are in Da Nang. 
 Hello! 
 Back in December, my airpods were stolen in Da Nang. Since I was flying out the same day, I couldn&#x27;t do much and went my way. 
 Today, I got a ping on Find My app with the exact address. They are in Phuoc Ninh, Hai Châu, Da Nang. 
 What are my options to recover them? Would the police take this seriously? 
 They were my first gift to my would be fiance, so the emotional value matters a lot more than the financial value.

                              <span>I’m flying into Hanoi. I’ve read bits about how bringing fresh high denomination notes can get you a better exchange rate than just withdrawing cash when you are there? 
 If that’s the case, can anyone recommend a place to do this in Hanoi? 
 Or should I just withdraw cash when I arrive? 
 Thank you!!

 Last year I went to Thailand and the subreddit r/Thailandtourism helped me a lot because I could look I could look up a lot of stuff and ask questions. It seems like there is no equivalent subreddit for traveling Vietnam, is there a site which a lot of people use that I just don&#x27;t know of? Or is traveling through Vietnam that much rarer and information is not sought after?
 It feels like I just don&#x27;t know a very obvious site/forum...

                              <span>Need help choosing which Ha Giang Loop tour to take!
 Planning to do a 3/4 day Ha Giang Loop tour with an easy rider (can’t ride a motorbike, and honestly some parts of the route looks hella dangerous for someone w no experience). Saw lots of different tour groups, and most of them (Jasmine Hostel, Ha Giang Road Trip, QTmotors) seem to have pretty good reviews, making it kind of hard to choose between them. Could someone recommend me a suitable one based on these criteria?
 (1) Can arrange for transport back and forth from Hanoi (2) Experienced, heavy focus on safety (3) Really just a personal preference, but would prefer one with less of a ‘party’ vibe. Saw lots of videos with HUGE groups that are kind of loud and wild at night, and honestly I’d just like one with more of a chill vibe/ a smaller group (4) I don’t mind spending more, but lower prices would be great!
 Also, is there a big difference in the weather in end April and middle of May? 
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: I’ll be doing this in End April/May :) do PM me if you’re planning to go there too!

                              <span>A lot of people have told me to avoid ice in my drinks as it’s unfiltered tap water? As well as seafood and salads etc. I’m wondering with all these conditions per se it feels like I’m walking thin ice just to enjoy my holiday; although I imagine something like typhoid or salmonella would be much worse etc etc. How do the locals avoid this? How do you know what’s safe to eat etc considering there is so many of you. Or is it much less of a worry then made out too be?

 I might come back to the central region just to see more of hue. 
 Anyone likes hue too? Especially on a scooter, its really enjoyable that way
 No one talks about the nearby rolling hills near the tombs. They are amazing.

                              <span>Looking for insights on the following;
 I am considering to move from Europe to HCM with my GF(Vietnamese). I&#x27;ve visited the city few times and absolutely love it. However, I would like to know how is the worklife in Vietnam (e.g. working style, hours)? Obviously companies are not the same - is there a large difference when working in a Western company and local?
 My concern comes from previous experience, when I was working in a Chinese company, and did not find the working style to be suitable for me. I felt that there was not enough freedom to conduct work within the strict corporate hierarchy. Also, had too much unnecessary work (internal processes), which requires constant overtime. Are Chinese and Vietnamese working styles similar or different?
 I&#x27;m currently working in senior management, and I&#x27;m not able to speak Vietnamese.
 All comments highly appreciated!
 Tldr: planning to move to Vietnam, would like to know more about the worklife

                              <span>Hello, My parents are both Vietnamese immigrants who immigrated after 1975. I was born in Canada. I went to Vietnam on a tourist visa, however, the process is long and arduous. As I read on the Vietnamese Embassy in Canada’s website, a child of Vietnamese citizens could get exempt from a visa. However, as my parents both have Canadian passports, I don’t think this is feasible, but would ask if in any way I could be exempt from a visa or maybe claim Vietnamese citizenship from my parents. Thank you!

                              <span>Hey all! Visiting Vietnam in March, and am curious if there are things to do in Phong Nha if you aren&#x27;t super sporty or adventurous? I&#x27;m good with an afternoon cave trip, or an afternoon guided hike, but more than that would be overwhelming for me. Is it still worth visiting if my priorities are soaking up the landscape, eating good food, and taking photos no one will ever see?

                              <span>I’ll be heading to Vietnam in late February. I’d like to visit just one city and spend time getting to know it as well as I can. I like to walk around a lot, go to museums and eat local food. 
 Which city do you recommend? 
 Appreciate it!

                              <span>I saw these beauties on my last trip to Saigon at one of the markets. For those of you who are frog connoisseurs, how are these things cooked and then eaten...fried, boiled, barbecued ? Are they considered to be quite a delicacy and rather expensive? Are there different varieties of frogs...some that might be delicious and some that would not make for &quot;good eating?&quot;

                              <span>Chào mọi người. Tôi hiện đang sử dụng một ứng dụng dịch thuật nên tôi xin lỗi nếu ngữ pháp của tôi không chính xác. Tôi muốn thể hiện sự đánh giá cao của mình với một người bạn rất tốt của tôi, gần đây cô ấy đã là một tảng đá đối với tôi và tôi muốn thể hiện sự đánh giá cao của mình với cô ấy. Cô ấy tình cờ là người Việt Nam nên tôi tự hỏi liệu tôi có thể làm gì hoặc làm gì để bày tỏ rằng tôi đánh giá cao cô ấy như thế nào. Và cho cô ấy thấy rằng tôi cũng ở đó để hỗ trợ cô ấy. tôi có thể làm đồ trang sức bằng kim loại quý vì vậy tôi đã nghiêng về đồ trang sức nhưng tôi không chắc về ý nghĩa văn hóa của một số món đồ nhất định. tôi không muốn vô tình cầu hôn vì tôi đã làm một kiểu nhẫn nhất định hoặc làm một thứ gì đó không phù hợp với mối quan hệ của chúng tôi. cô ấy là một trong những người bạn thân nhất của tôi. Bất kỳ giúp đỡ hoặc tư vấn được đánh giá cao

                              <span>My friend and me going to drive with our motorbike from HCMC to Da Nang and looking for some recommendation on the road. We are focussing on beaches, nice small villages/cities, rural areas and mostly nature.
 Our itinerary so far: HCMC – Phan Thiet – Da Lat – Nha Trang – (Hoi An) – Da Nang. Any beautiful spot in-between?
 We&#x27;ve been in Vietnam 2 times, traveling with the bike South to North and love this country, the people and the cuisine. We had good times here and looking forward to see new things.
 Thank you :-)

                              <span>Nothing against the Kinh, but I&#x27;m looking for something that feels a bit different, since I already live in the country. Usually when you go to the more diverse provinces (Lào Cai, Hà Giang, ...), the hotels are all run by Kinh people. I once asked a hotelier in Sapa about this and he said &#x27;they [referring to Hmong/Dao] don&#x27;t know how to run businesses&#x27;, which was amusingly direct.
 Anyway, any good recommendations in scenic areas in the far North? I would love to fall asleep to the sound of a different language (Hmong, Dao, Tày, anything really) being spoken by the proprietor&#x27;s family. Many thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m from Malaysia, I just got back from Vietnam, Saigon, few days ago during Chinese New Year, it was my first time being in Vietnam.
 The people there were super friendly, compare to the other neighbouring SEA countries, I would dare say THE MOST friendly and interactive people, I actually felt welcomed. Food was amazing, the street food blew my mind, I ate banh mi twice a day, daily and never got sick of it. Never got to try pho but I had bun bo hue and others which I don&#x27;t knkw what it was, I just pointed the picture, nod and bow a little cause I felt bad that I couldn&#x27;t speak Vietnamese.
 My mistake was not knowing that Vietnamese was celebrating Lunar New Year and most shops were closed for 3 to 4 days and we didnt get to see, eat most of the food we wanted to try, experience the culture, went to vung tau on the 4th day instead, wrong choice I would say because I think the locals went there for holiday or went back to their hometown, that&#x27;s my assumption, so the traffic was pretty heavy but it was a fun.
 I should have gone there on the 5th day of Lunar New Year/Chinese New Year but all and all, it was an amazing place, fell in love with Vietnam just like how I fell in love with Japan when I first visited it, Extremely friendly, yes I can&#x27;t express enough the friendliness of the Vietnamese
 My next trip is to visit Hanoi, any recommendations of place to visit? Food to try or anything that the locals usually enjoy
 Thank you, from your neighbour, Malaysia

                              <span>Hello all, 
 If this is answered in a different thread, obviously please direct me accordingly. 
 I&#x27;m looking for a range of recommendations whether it be food, sights, experiences for when I visit in a few days. Will be flying into the North and working my way down south. 
 Any recommendations be appreciated! 
 Many thanks.

 During a travel In Vietnam, i met someone special for me and now that I&#x27;m at home (not in Vietnam), I would like to send her a gift. I thought about buying some things from Aliexpress and tell them to deliver to her address. Is there any special thing I should be aware before sending her gifts? I mean, any special regulations about Aliexpress in Vietnam, any special way to pay for the taxes, anything I should be aware? Or can I just send it normally like I would do to send it to any other country?
 Thanks you in advance!

                              <span>Hi! I will be travelling for the very first time to Hanoi and i am planning to get an apartment there for a whole month, but I am very undecided about where to stay. I don&#x27;t drive and usually walk everywhere, I&#x27;ve been told I should stay in Tay Ho and it looks great for walking, but I am also wondering whether for a first trip it would be better to stay in Old Quarter? As I would like to also have access to the buses / trains to do trips to Halong Bay / Sapa etc.
 I&#x27;ve actually eyed an apartment which is exactly in between Tay Ho and Old Quarter, near the Tran Quoc Pagoda. Google Maps says it&#x27;s a 25-30 minutes walk in either direction which i normally would not mind at all, but I&#x27;ve heard horror stories about the traffic in Hanoi so I am wondering whether this is doable or not?

 I am not sure if my question belongs here, if it doesn&#x27;t please feel free to ignore it / delete it.
 I (m33) am married to a vietnamese (w28) since 7 years now. We don&#x27;t life in Vietnam but we are here for a prolonged time often, mostly to stay with her Family.
 When I met my wife she was a sweet, cute, self conscious and family oriented person which i fell in love with. After we got our son 5 years ago we had a rough time for a couple of years. I needed to work too much to provide for us and she had the burden of taking care of the kid most of the time. In my opinion she fell into depression during that time which i was unable to recognize.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I really enjoy coffee and have been in Vietnam for almost a month now. I&#x27;ve noticed that when I order a Den / Black Coffee (no sugar, no additives) it usually comes with a cup of water (sometimes hot water).
 Is there a reason for this? Am I supposed to do something with the water such as mixing it or perhaps drinking water first, then drinking the coffee? Just curious. I thank you in advance.

We need it for big amount of online meetings in case our wifi will be causing problems, so we really need reliable and fast provider. We will be in Danang if it helps. Thank you in adavnce!

                              <span>Hello r/Vietnam,
 I am currently living in Yen Bai and I was wondering if there are any other redditors living in this area. I would love to organize a meeting where we can get to know each other, share our experiences, and maybe even plan some activities together.
 It would be great to connect with people who share a common interest and it would be nice to have a community to rely on.
 So, if you live in Yen Bai, please let me know in the comments and let&#x27;s see if we can make this happen.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been living in this lovely country for the past four years. Pleiku has been on my list for traveling for 2 years. I and 3 other friends decided to travel to Pleiku during Tết. Simply, Amazing. As an expat, I would highly recommend folks to travel to Pleiku. The people, food, nature/scenary, culture, history and weather-(depending on the time of year ofc))
 Would also love to hear people&#x27;s experience about coming here pre and post covid:)!
 Chúc mừng năm quý mão các bạn ơi ♥️

                              <span>My vietnam passport is about to expire and I would need to renew it. The problem is that I don’t live in SF, NY, pr Houston, and their website doesn’t really say enough information of the fees and other papers needed (if any). I tried to call them but they never picked up. Has anyone renewed their passport recently? Or know how to do it? Thank you

                              <span>Hi! Is there any martial arts that are native to Vietnam, like Muay Thai is to Thailand? I haven&#x27;t heard of any and I would love to learn more about them if they exist.
 Also, is martial arts just not very popular in Vietnam? It seems there aren&#x27;t many pro boxers who come from Vietnam. Is martial arts not as deeply rooted in Vietnamese culture as places like Thailand, China, and Japan?

 But odopo redirects me to change the date on the vietjetair site. How do I do this, I have the flight id but no account, does someone know how to change it?
 Thanks in advance:)

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for recommendations on the history of Vietnam from a Vietnamese perspective. In particular books covering 19th and 20th century (both, or either!) Must be available in English.
 Finding it very difficult to find books that are not memoirs of American soldiers! Very much want to read from a Vietnamese perspective.

                              <span>So the last time I actually watched it was 2020 but even before that I did not even pay attention to the show at all. There were way too many ads and the contents were not that good. I understand what they tried to refer to but I don&#x27;t appreciate them much (mostly because the way they make jokes about events of the year do not solve anything and for me, normalizes all that shits); and yah, I do not find their jokes or &quot;deep&quot;.
 BUT, I understand why some like it and that&#x27;s great for them.
 What I am quite puzzled about is that some would go all the ways to look down on all those who don&#x27;t like the show. Some would even make remarks and insults others over this.
 So please educate me, is there any thing else about the show that makes it &quot;sacred&quot;? or is it just some people being too close-minded?

If you do, could you recommend me where to buy it? I’d like to know hoping that it would be cheaper compared to where I live now. Thanks!

                              <span>Recieved a term sheet from a local startup. I&#x27;m looking to negotiate/restructure the offer the deal to focus on ownership and future initial offering options. But this would be way over my head. I&#x27;ve been given good advice so far, to look for the equivalent corporate/employment attorney in vn. But when I inquire with the international business foundation they seen to be oblivious. I have a call in to my council back home but, there&#x27;s certainly no guarantees they know what&#x27;s best here.
 Any business owners might be able to perhaps give me the correct term for such a lawyer in vnmese?

                              <span>Hey everything, I&#x27;m thinking of doing the Ha Giang loop on a motorbike in north Vietnam in the next couple of weeks. Originally I was thinking of doing it without a guide, because I want the freedom to explore and maybe do some hiking. However, talking to a few people has made me think it might be better to do it guided, most likely with Jasmine Hostel. Does anyone here have experience with the pros and cons of each? 
 Personally I like the idea of doing it without a guide because I have more freedom to stop and take pictures, explore off the beaten path, do some hiking, and stay longer than 3 nights if I want to. The pros of doing it guided is the social aspect, staying at the best homestays, and the guides knowing the best views and all that. 
 Any feedback or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks I&#x27;m advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand more Vietnamese and Vietnamese culture and I wonder what films and TV shows feel like touchstones of the culture. Not necessarily &quot;best films or shows&quot; in terms of production or even storytelling, but the things that would make you feel more connected to Vietnam or Vietnamese culture if you were abroad.

                              <span>Hey I am off to Vietnam again in June. I have previously done a street food tour in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. This time I am focusing on Hoi an/Danang and Nha Trang. Which would be the best town to have a street food tour. We aren&#x27;t really into seafood. We have already done the Red Bridge cooking class twice. Are there any other companies that do this. Nha Trang or Danang/Hoi an.

                              <span>I figured I&#x27;d put this here as it is more of a specialist recipe compared to the scope of a more generalist subreddit like r/cooking, and the Vietnamese food subs are not exactly what could be called active or even semi active. 
 So I have seen various Vietnamese style grilled eel recipes (example: Chargrilled eel in lemongrass and turmeric (luon nuong xa) recipe : SBS Food) that are very much tickling my fancy. I&#x27;ve thought up a cooking method that sounds to me like it would give good results, but it&#x27;s not something I have ever seen suggested anywhere else so I have no idea whether it would work.
 Specifically, what I am thinking about is pre-cooking the eel before grilling it by poaching in nuoc cham, and then finishing on the grill. What I hope to accomplish with this is: 
 -Getting flavor throughout the eel without having to worry about prematurely denaturing the proteins by using the nuoc cham as the poaching liquid. The lime juice in nuoc cham would do that if the eel was raw, but would not if it was just the cooking liquid because the eel would be cooked before denaturing could happen.
 I also intend to pierce the eel with a fork to get even more flavor throughout, if need be.
 -Setting the stage for a caramelized, crispy finish. The sugars in nuoc cham would be all over the meat and allow for good caramelization.
 As I said though I&#x27;ve never seen this suggested before, so I have troubleshooting questions. Specifically:
 -My primary question: will poaching in nuoc cham make the eel TOO strongly flavored? I like my food a bit more strongly seasoned than most, but as nuoc cham is so strong, I would be cautious about overflavoring here.
 -Would the sugar content end up to more rapid burning than expected when finishing on the grill? I absolutely abhor burnt food so a heads up warning if it is a fine line would be much appreciated.
 Thank you so much and I can&#x27;t wait to branch out to this area of Vietnam&#x27;s cuisine!

                              <span>Is given name a combination of First Name + middle name? Or is it backwards, middle + first?
 For example: my spouses passport given name says Thi Dan Tam, so does that mean that her first name is actually Thi, and middle name is Dan Tam?
 She goes by Tam so I’m not sure if the vietnamese passport just had a different given name format from the usual American passport
 My US Passports given name format is First + Middle.. so this is why I’m a little confused.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 Looking for low rise apartments or houses etc in D7. I am claustrophobic and can’t go in elevators so the place needs to be accessible by stairs. Also small dog friendly. Any thoughts? Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all, a friend and I are flying into Ho chi minh at the end of March. We&#x27;ve roughly planned to spend 10 - 14 days in Vietnam before heading to phuket (probably flying out of Hanoi). It&#x27;s only my second ever overseas trip, I just have no idea how to go about it. Out of convenience (we will have suitcases) I&#x27;ve planned to stay roughly a week in Ho Chi Minh, explore the surroundings then fly to Hanoi and stay there roughly a week and explore surroundings. I&#x27;m just not sure if this is the right way to go about it, I feel like we would be missing out on a lot of stuff if we are just sticking around the main cities. Would it be better to just spend a few days in Ho Chi Minh then head north a few hours each day by car and stay somewhere new every night or every couple of nights? I&#x27;d love any suggestions on some good accomodation, sights to see and just any must do activities while in Vietnam. We love all natural wonders such as mountains, national parks, rivers ect but also want to have some time just exploring and hanging out in the cities and experiencing some night life. Taking all suggestions into consideration and any rough itineraries are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

 Reminder that a new adaptation of the story is on VTV3 today (8pm Thursday). I thought people learning Vietnamese might be interested. For many others, reading this brings back sweet childhood memory.

                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;m going to finally visit Vietnam right in the beginning of May. I&#x27;m planning to spend about 2 weeks in the country, starting from the north and making my way down to Ho Chi Min city and than flying back home. 
 I was wondering how bad would the weather be? I understand it&#x27;s the wet season and not the optimal time to visit but that&#x27;s my only option, unfortunately. Is it still a viable option at that time of the year?
 Thank you all very much!

I recently posted about assessing the value of a house but after some initial negotiations with the family in Vietnam, I might need legal representation to get the the proper amount that I’m owed by law. 
 My Vietnamese isn’t good so I can’t do a very good job finding and talking to one. Plus I don’t know if there’s an bar association I can use to verify accreditation. 
 Would love to get your thoughts and suggestions. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, i will be going to Vietnam in February and will be staying staying in can tho for a few months as an intern. I will have 1 week to travel across the country (thinking about the north of Vietnam). I would like some advice about things to visit in the south while i am staying in the mekong Delta and what places I should visit when I travel across the country. As this is my first time going to Vietnam, some general advice is also appreciated.

                              <span>I need to travel tomorrow from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh, but there are no busses or trains available. I’m thinking of going by taxi, but I do not know what service I can trust. Because it is a lot of money I don’t want to be scammed. Any help with this?
 Any tips and help will be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Some Vietnamese make the V sign when I take photos.

 So does it mean V for Vietnam?
 Or 2 pronounced like hi as some online sources say?

                              <span>Chào các bạn /Hello everyone. I’m a US citizen who has recently moved to Vietnam to be with my wife. We met years ago and have been dating for a few years before we got married, and I have finally just dropped everything and moved to Vietnam to be with her. I’m still working on my bachelors degree, but I have a couple years of experience as a professional Vietnamese-English interpreter. I desperately need a job and it has been hard to find something so far. If anyone knows a local job that would work, or even a US based job that I can do remotely, I’d really appreciate it!

                              <span>Hi, can anyone recommend a shipping company from HCMC to USA. Large 50 kilo boxes? Does not need to be expressed, sea freight is fine.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am travelling to Vietnam very soon. In the UK I can get 25,000 VND for 1 GBP (21,000 VND for 1 USD). 
 Does anyone know the rate I could get in HCMC. 
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Viet Kieu living in Vietnam at the moment, and part of several Facebook groups of women, including single women. I&#x27;m seeing more and more women decided to skip matching with white foreigners on dating apps like Bumble. Members in the group share &quot;sexual escapades&quot; by white foreigners in Thailand, which recently tighten their immigration policies, and cause a lot of them to &quot;flee&quot; to other SEA countries like Vietnam. Bald white guys in their 30s are the most obvious skip for these girls, and they are well informed of the LBH that are here on working visas. The language barrier is also another issue they mention, where it&#x27;s exhausting to use Google translate for every little thing. Many of them share stories of them being coerced into sex by these men, even on first date.
 I&#x27;m not really surprised to hear all these stories from Viet girls in both Saigon and Hanoi, and I also translate and share a few of these creeps&#x27; posts from reddit on Facebook. Ever since the pandemic Viet people seem to be more wary of white foreigners (they seem more receptive to Koreans and other Asians)
 Of course, some of the more malicious girls like to take these naive foreigners on a wild ride with expensive dates then ditch them.

                              <span>Vietnamese American here, I&#x27;m doing research on all the different fox spirits across asia and while China, Japan, and Korea&#x27;s nine tailed foxes seem to have plenty of sources online that I can look at, there&#x27;s barely any for vietnam&#x27;s, and my best source thus far for the ho ly tinh has been wikipedia but even its wikipedia page says that it needs more citations and more reliable resources. So I wanted to ask here to see what y&#x27;all know about it and preferably if you could also point me in the direction of any sources(preferred is english because I don&#x27;t know how to read or type vietnamese but I can make do with google translate.) 
 I also wanted to ask how people in vietnam generally view the creature.
 In China and Japan they range from pure evil, to harmless pranksters, to very kind and benevolent beings.
 In Korea, they are seen as purely malevolent creatures
 So I wanted to know how Vietnam generally views them. Do they range from being good to evil? Or are they just evil?
 What powers do they have, generally speaking?
 And the most important one is, how do they get their many tails? Is it just through age? Or do they do something special to get their tails? 
 I&#x27;ve wanted to reconnect with my culture now and I want to do it with my life long passion for mythology. Thank you in advance for any help!

                              <span>Hi - I&#x27;m booking SYD - CDG (return) via HAN direct with VA (website). I noticed last night the layover/connection time is 105 minutes. I can find info on their domestic connections but not on international. Can anyone that&#x27;s flown international thru Hanoi, or that knows how it works there, let me know if 1hr 45 is enough time? I assume as with other airlines they&#x27;ll transit the luggage, i.e., I won&#x27;t have to go to baggage, pick it up and transit it through. Is this also correct? Thanks.

                              <span>Dumb question but I am extremely puzzled. All the toilets here have a bidet for washing ones ass after taking a dump. They are manual bidets - basically a garden hose to spray up ones rectum. However, this can&#x27;t remove everything cleanly. I&#x27;ve gotten around this by carrying tissues with me and doing a combination of the bidet and paper wipes. Are people just sitting on the toilet and spraying nonstop until everything is cleaned? Are people just walking around with chocolate fudge in their rectums all day? I need to know!

                              <span>Just wanted to rave and spread positivity... But i moved to Vietnam in late 2017 and been here ever since.. First 2 years was a growing period, but after the 3rd year, i&#x27;ve come to fall in love with this country so much. I love Hcmc/Saigon, love the weather, the food, the people.... Happy New year and God bless!

                              <span>Hey there I&#x27;m asking for my grandfather who was a former ARVN captain if he returned to Vietnam to visit would he be arrested or persecuted for what he was apart of?
 He escaped after the fall of South Vietnam and is thinking of returning but is afraid of the government sending him to jail or give him a hard time.
 Any advice from all people would be great, thanks.
 Also happy tet!

                              <span>I moved to Hanoi last summer and honestly I’ve had a terrible experience, I was sexually assaulted in the first week of arriving and I’m still dealing with the police beaurocracy regarding that. Had a breakup of my 2 year relationship, with the person I moved over to Vietnam with and subsequently lost my job due to needing time off to process that. In addition to these personal things, the pollution bothers me and I still haven’t yet mastered driving a motorbike because I had a pretty nasty crash which has put me off for the time being. 
 In my head I’m imagining a move to HCM to be much better, I previously lived in Shanghai and I do prefer the feeling of a big metropolis - but I guess the problems with traffic are even worse there? I’ve struggled to find contemporary art and music events, and it seems like there is more of that type of thing in HCM. 
 Or do I have completely the wrong idea? Should I move somewhere else entirely? I can’t feasibly leave Vietnam for another year because I really need to make back the money I spent on document legalisation etc to get here 
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>Hello,
 We have a house in D3 3 floors high easy access to D1 we would like to add 2/3 more floors along with rooftop terrace.
 Due to the cost of the house I assume the way they charge is based on sq meter for that area? Has any foreigners ever did this of so how much did you spend? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I am going on a 2 week holiday to vietnam. Really looking forward to it.
 I am receiving injections for typhoid, hep a, diphtheria and tetanus. 
 However I am considering getting the rabies vaccine. I am going to the tourist hotspots and won’t be doing any animal related activities. 
 Has anyone else here got the rabies vaccine before living/ travelling in vietnam? Thanks

                              <span>Foreigner here. I go to my wife&#x27;s hometown pretty often, so for the last four years, I&#x27;ve joined in a lot of celebrations and ran into a lot of the same faces. The &quot;anh&quot;s and &quot;chú&quot;s still really like to drink with me and I&#x27;m always sort of a VIP at gatherings despite being more of an introvert and not good in large gatherings.
 My problem: a lot of these guys think it&#x27;s so fun to ask me what their names are in front of everyone, and more often than not, I don&#x27;t remember. It&#x27;s always the same super embarrassing moment when I&#x27;m racking my brain to think of this guy&#x27;s name while everyone is either cringing or laughing at me. And then they tell me their name but because I&#x27;m so mortified, I just can&#x27;t even remember it later even if I make a mental note. My Vietnamese is intermediate, but a lot of these guys in the village have names that I don&#x27;t know the meanings of, so hard to draw connections...
 This is why gatherings in my wife&#x27;s hometown are not fun for me. I&#x27;m always on edge, and when I sit down around a &quot;mâm&quot;, I need to look around and see if there&#x27;s anyone I don&#x27;t know or remember and try to listen for their name in conversation. 
 So what should I do to stop looking like such an asshole who can&#x27;t be bothered to learn people&#x27;s name and how to better diffuse the situation when it inevitably happens that I don&#x27;t know a name?

                              <span>Wow... this is probably an impossible question to answer, but we&#x27;re planning our 2 week trip to Vietnam March 7-21 and after accounting for Hanoi (3ish days), Hoi An (3ish days), Ninh Binh (2ish days), I feel like we can only include 1 of these &#x27;adventure&#x27; places to not feel rushed. If you HAD to pick 1 (maaaybe 2) of these experiences, what&#x27;s your pick?
 3ish days to trek in Sapa
 4 days motorbiking the Ha Giang Loop
 3 days with a guided cave expedition in Phong Nha
 3 days motorbiking/trekking in Dalat
 Some background info: my wife and I are in our late 20&#x27;s and love combining city life, food, culture, and nature/adventure on our trips. If anything, it&#x27;s hard for us to &#x27;chill&#x27; and slow down while traveling, but we&#x27;re certainly trying to embody that on this trip more than others :)

                              <span>I plan to live in Vietnam for 6 months later this year, and hope to bring my cat with me. I will be flying from Canada to Vietnam. With a brief google search I&#x27;ve found that as long as my cat fits in a carry on bag under my seat, has her rabies shot, documents with her history of vaccines, and a vet approved letter she should be able to fly and enter the country with me. 
 I&#x27;d love to know if anyone can share their experience travelling with a pet to Vietnam and if I am missing any information. Thank you!

                              <span>I will be traveling to Nha Trang for the first time in October. What are some things that are a must know? (things to do, travel suggestions for first-timers, things to avoid) 
 I am from the USA, so I am nervous about culturally offending locals from my ignorance, so I want to study up on some basic things to do or not to do. Thank you!

 Would you retire in Vietnam and why?

                              <span>Hello! Please help me (39F and Canadian) do something kind for my Vietnamese immigrant neighbours (late 20s M/F and 3F) for Lunar New Year tomorrow.
 They are such good neighbours! They made me pho when I had surgery and they feed my children homemade spring rolls. One time the Ba Noi was visiting from Vietnam and she made me shrimp in banana leaves but I didn’t know how to eat it. I tried to ask the Ba Noi but she doesn’t speak English so I just tried to take a bite out of the banana leaf. The Ba Noi laughed and laughed and showed me how to unwrap them and eat the shrimp.
 Their little 3F comes over to play with my kids almost every day and we just love her so much. Her parents work so hard — six days a week and long hours. They are such good people and I’m so happy to know them. 
 Anyhow, tomorrow is Lunar New Year and I know they usually have a big party with their Vietnamese friends and set off fireworks. 
 I read that usually you give gifts of money in red envelopes for Lunar New Year. Would that be appropriate for me, their white Canadian neighbour, to bring over tomorrow?
 My two concerns are that I don’t want them to feel that they have to invite me to their party, reciprocate the gift or make them uncomfortable. Also I don’t want to accidentally do something unlucky.
 Thank you Reddit for any advice you can give me!

                              <span>On behalf of the mod team of r/Vietnam, I would like to send you greetings for the Luna New Year, the year of the Cat! Wishing you a year fully loaded with happiness, good health, wealth and luck.
 Thank you for participating in r/Vietnam and keep the sub going daily. 
 I would also like to send special thanks to the members who have volunteered to spend their time and effort answering a lot of questions in the sub every day, whether it&#x27;s easy or difficult. You are the heroes who don&#x27;t wear capes, and I&#x27;m really, really grateful for having you guys here!
 Thay mặt cho mod team của r/Vietnam, mình xin gửi lời chúc mừng năm mới tới tất cả các thành viên của sub! Chúc mọi người một năm Quý Mão ngập tràn hạnh phúc, tài lộc, và may mắn!
 Cảm ơn các bạn đã tham gia vào sub và giữ cho nó hoạt động hàng ngày.
 Mình cũng rất biết ơn những thành viên đã tình nguyện bỏ thời gian công sức của các bạn ra để trả lời vô số câu hỏi được gửi vào sub mỗi ngày. Cảm ơn rất nhiều những đóng góp thầm lặng của các bạn.
 P/S: Sorry if the sub seems a bit messy these days. Like other Vietnamese, I also have to prepare for Tet and enjoy the holiday with my family. Will come back to clean up the sub after a few days :P

                              <span>We are considering a month summer trip on the Vietnam SE coast. Potentially flying into Denang and spending a week in Hoi An and then maybe flying or night bus/train to Nha Trang and staying there for 3 weeks for relaxing beach time. 
 I’ve read you can’t rent a car in Vietnam and we would not feel comfortable riding scooters with our kid (or even probably just an adult 🤣). 
 The places I’m looking at to stay are not in the city center so we can have more space and a pool. We already live in a high rise in a big SE Asian city, so I’d prefer a villa experience while on vacation. 
 My husband thinks having to use Grab multiple time a day if you want to grocery shop, eat out, visit a different beach will be a huge hassle and the cost will add up. This feels like a dealbreaker to him and he thinks we should scrap the Vietnam idea and go to a different country. :(. I read about hiring a car with driver for a few weeks. This sounds pretty weird to me and maybe awkward, but I figured I need to explore this option.
 How do you find a trusted driver like that? Through your villa rental management staff or is their a reputable company people use? I’ve read about scams where drivers will try to take you to restaurants or tours that give them a commission, which I want to avoid. 
 TIA!

                              <span>My Vietnamese fiancé (25F) and I (30M) are getting married in the UK in a few months. She has a marriage visa for the UK and we’ve done our notice of marriage with our local government. The Registar said that we need to get paperwork from the Vietnam Embassy in London. Looking online and the only information I can find is for if we are getting married in Vietnam. 
 Anyone with experience in the area, your insight would be greatly appreciated! TIA

                              <span>Hey all, we&#x27;re travelling to Vietnam with our two kids (one is two years old and one is four months) in mid Feb, for three weeks. Are there any things we absolutely must see?
 Current plan is to fly in and out of HCMC, travelling up the country between, with potential stops in Hoi An, Hanoi, and maybe Phu Quoc. But suggestions are very much welcome!

                              <span>Anyone watched the popular anime Fruits Basket? (also a popular manga). The story is about the twelve animals and the cat. Only the Vienmames zodiac does justice to our wonderful meow friends. 😺

                              <span>I’m a first-year college student from the States studying geographic information systems and computer science. My university has a study abroad program with RMIT Vietnam that I’m interested in and was wondering how good the university is regarding their curriculum and class settings. I’m set to graduate a year early within my degree plan as I’ve earned many college credits during high school and I want to have an opportunity to go out of the States to study abroad during my 3 years in college.
 How are the programs or courses in information technology and computer science there? Most importantly, what’s the outlook like with the tech or CS industry in Vietnam as I’m interested in networking around as well. I’m looking at doing a semester worth of courses, so any insights about university life and studies revolving around the RMIT campus or Vietnam in general are highly appreciated.

                              <span>I am really amazed so I had to make a post. Not sure if it’s the hot climate or the travel jitters or something else, but I just have trouble finishing my meals here
 Vegetable Spring rolls look tiny, but somehow I already feel full after eating just a couple. Bánh mì is another one - just half a sandwich and I’m already satisfied. And don’t get me started on the pho or bun bo hue - I think it would take me two full days to finish one bowl
 Back home I could easily devour several slices of pizza and still be hungry, so not sure why Vietnamese food is filling me up so quickly lol

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I applied for visa through them thinking they were government official site (gov.vn) and received the e-visa about a week later. I then asked a question about how my name appears on the e-visa (last,first, middle vs. last, middle,first) and got no response. It’s been a week since. I read the on the embassy website that visas done by third party may not be legit and can result in entrance refusal. Anyone has experience with this site or this kind of service? Thanks

                              <span>Hi! Does anyone know if it is legal to bring in Velo Nicotine pouches to Vietnam? I have just ordered 25 cans to DaNang. 
 Otherwise, do you know any place or person from where to buy snus/nicotine pouches around DaNang? 
 Thanks!

 sorry for the question, google only provides results from 9+ years ago and we haven&#x27;t traveled in the last three years.

 Am asking the locals here and also any expats in case I miss anything.
 It can be places to visit, foods, history, anecdotes or anything that can be interesting.
 Want to keep first impressions fresh and stir the curiosity of anyone who might be interested in visiting.
 Serious replies please and open to suggestions.
 P.S: Let me know what I should avoid photographing or filming if anything.

                              <span>Hi all, I am planning a trip of about 3/4 weeks in Vietnam and I would like to travel the whole country from north to south (or maybe the other way around).
 Because of work, the only times I can take a full 3 to 4 weeks is either August or end of December/beginning of January around the Christmas holidays. I seem to understand that both these times are not ideal from a weather point of view.
 I have been researching quite a bit and if I got it right it looks like I am going to risk typhoons in the north in August; while December is quite cold in the north and very rainy in the central area of Hue and Hoi An.
 Unfortunately I cannot get around these two times of the year, so I was wondering if you have any suggestions. Maybe some of you have been in August or December and can let me know if it&#x27;s really risky to the point of having the whole trip ruined by weather?
 I am somewhat tending towards December. Can you enjoy the cruise in Halong Bay at this time or is it too cold and foggy?
 Thanks so much for any tip you may want to give me! :)

                              <span>We’ve been using a Vietnamese supplier exporting products to me abroad and recently their quality has gone down with the most recent completely faulty and unusable. 
 I’m also certain they’re cheating taxes making me so weird things sending to their personal accounts instead of their business bank account. 
 What are my options. They refuse to refund me. I’m a small business and it’s really going to hurt me if they won’t refund me. 
 Thanks in advance.

 I am backpacking Vietnam in February/March, starting in Hanoi and then settling in HCMC to work.
 What would be best for me to buy travelling wise when I get to Vietnam, rather than here in the UK, to potentially save money?
 I know its a broad question so I do apologise but anyone with experience etc the help would be much much appreciated :)

                              <span>Hi! I am trying to find some funny jokes that will help me better understand the humor. From my research it seems the North vietnamese culture has a lot of wordplay jokes, and the South favors slapstick comedy. What are some of your favorite jokes, and if you could also explain in English why they are funny that would help a lot, too! I am a total beginner in my learning of the language. Thank you to everyone who shares :)

                              <span>As a foreigner here that has a deep love for Vietnam and its culture, i always felt it was important to learn the language. My Vietnamese is ok, but it could, should and one day will be much better! 
 My honest question is though ... Why do so many Vietnamese people make it so hard to learn the language? By this i mean, if I say something wrong in Thai or Khmer, or Italian, I am corrected and helped. In Vietnam, they just give you the &quot;wavy hands&quot; or worse still laugh!
 When Vietnamese speak English to me, much of it is wrong, but I appreciate that they are trying and I &quot;autocorrect&quot; what they said in my head, so as to not embarrass them and then I answer them. The same cannot be said the other way. 
 I really am not meaning to be rude, but why do many Vietnamese (I appreciate it not all) simply try to help me, by autocorrecting and helping me to speak better? 
 Many thanks for all your help!

                              <span>As someone who works in football here in Vietnam (and across Asia) as a foreigner Vietnamese football is as fascinating as much as it is infuriating.
 Like most leagues and countries there are issues with corruption, greed and self interest. But what really gets me with Vietnam is the MASSIVE potential for the sport, the huge love for the support... but the terrible attendances to league games.
 Sure there are issues with marketing, match fixing, poor kick off times, poor product and more... but I would like to ask the Vietnamese in this group, and those that live here... What are the issues YOU see in Vietnamese football and how would you change them to make things better? Thanks!

                              <span>For clarity - I&#x27;m trying to understand the motivations of the Southern Vietnamese people during the war. 
 I understand the Catholics, land owners, and capitalists. They would obviously side with Western ideals.
 But it doesn&#x27;t explain the Buddhist majority, or the majority of people who were not that wealthy. Why did they fight with the U.S. against Ho Chi Minh? Can anyone shed some light on this issue? What were their motivations and beliefs?
 Every time I try to read about this I get the U.S. and International perspective. But I never understand what was happening with the actual Vietnamese people there.

                              <span>My girlfriend has been telling me about Lunar New Year. She grew up in Vietnam, we both currently live in the US (I&#x27;m white). I want to give her one of the red envelopes with lucky money but I don&#x27;t know how much to give. I&#x27;m 3 years older than her if that&#x27;s relevant. She said her lucky numbers are 6 and 8 so does it make sense to give her like $8? From what I&#x27;ve read it seems like the amount isn&#x27;t supposed to be a lot but I don&#x27;t want to be insensitive to her culture by giving too much or too little.

 I have all the details of the business and the person. Also got his pictures.
 An update: A local informant has stated, it&#x27;s possible that he filed bankruptcy.

                              <span>Hi all. My girlfriend is from Vietnam and she usually gets pretty homesick around this time of year for obvious reasons. I’m trying to think of a nice way for us to do something on Saturday night to celebrate. It’s our second Tết together, last year we did some basic decorating but it was hard to find anything good around where we are. She made some traditional food as well. This year I want to surprise her with something nice but don’t know what to do. Any ideas? Even something simple would be fine I think.

                              <span>Hello fellow Redditors,
 I am a 47-year-old Belgian man who has had the pleasure of visiting Vietnam 12 times, spending a total of 16 months there. Through my interactions with the South Vietnamese community where I live, as well as my multiple visits and online relationships, I have become fluent in speaking and writing in Vietnamese. In fact, when a native Vietnamese speaker hears me on the phone, they often mistake me for a Vietnamese person. In addition to my fluency in Vietnamese, I also speak French, Dutch and English, and have a basic understanding of German.
 My dream is to find a job in South Vietnam, but I am facing a bit of a hurdle. I have been working for the government since 1996 and therefore do not have any other qualifications beyond my high school diploma. Additionally, I have no concrete proof of the skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout my career. However, I am skilled in working with computers and have strong communication abilities. My current job involves designing templates that are sent to millions of citizens, but the software I use is not utilized by any companies in Vietnam.
 I am willing to accept a salary that is typical for Vietnam, as money is not a concern for me. My only qualifications are my high school diploma and my work experience, so my CV is essentially my career. I am open to any job, but I am unsure of the best course of action. Should I try to find a job while on a tourist visa and do visa runs until I secure employment? Or, should I enroll in a school in Ho Chi Minh City in order to obtain a student visa? I believe my English and Vietnamese language abilities are sufficient to pass any necessary tests, and I am eager to immerse myself in the educational experience.
 All I know is that I am happiest when I am in Vietnam, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to make my dream a reality. Thank you for reading and for your responses.

                              <span>With Tet almost here, this may seem like a silly question or I may be over thinking this a bit. 
 For context I am a Vietnamese Canadian living in Canada, a little over a month ago I had came back from my Vietnam trip and had matched on bumble with this girl from Vietnam. Long story short ever since then I&#x27;ve been feeling some type of way towards her (in a good way not a bad way).
 Growing up in Canada I&#x27;ve never really had the need to say new year wishes in Vietnamese to my other friends here but rather just my grandparents and parents. So I&#x27;m used to saying things like chúc mừng năm mới.. or con chúc ông bà nhiều xúc khỏe song lâu tram tuoi etc. 
 So my question is are there any ideas on how I can send her new year wishes without just the plain chúc mừng năm mới? In other words what are some ways to send wishes from friend to friend. 
 From the top of my head in the context of friend to friend, I can only think of wishing for good health, happiness and lots of money. 
 Apologies if this question came out kind of odd or if i&#x27;m overthinking it.

The UK government suggested I need to bring a prescription and a letter from my doctor, but they can be overzealous. I&#x27;d rather be cautious though !

                              <span>Hi, I study in Hanoi for the semester, and I&#x27;m in Sài Gòn for a week, and every Vietnamese I know told me Sài Gòn is just good for food and clubbing, nothing to visit (their words). So what typical/hard to find elsewhere food can I eat here and where in the city? I already tried hủ tiếu, bánh mí chảo and Bánh tráng trộn, they were all great. (if by any luck you know a good place to visit, share with us :)))

                              <span>My wife and I are visiting VN from March 8-26th. Where we are flying into and out is still in the air depending on the itinerary. I&#x27;m a 41 Hue refugee that at 2 months old we escaped from VN to Hong Kong then Philippines then CA, US. I have never been back, and the plan was to visit in 2020 but covid hit. Now is the time. Super excited. Minus traveling days we should have 16 full days.
 Here are the places I wanted to visit: Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Long bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An.
 Originally we wanted to fly into Saigon then fly into Da Nang and make our way up north and fly home from Hanoi. However after watching vids on youtube and reading, wondering if we should just skip Saigon and spread say 2 days to the cities mentioned above. Is it worth visiting giving our amount of days in VN? I&#x27;ve heard people say they wouldn&#x27;t have been sad if they skip it while others say it&#x27;s a must visit. Also how many days of each cities is sufficient.
 Any suggestions would be helpful. thank you.

                              <span>I used to study abroad in a different country and met a Vietnamese girl there. We hit it off and got into a relationship. I visited her twice in Vietnam and on the second visit found out she had been cheating on me through snooping. I need the help from someone to figure out what was said by her in her texts so I know what happened exactly. I believe this will give me some peace. I have quite a lot of texts. Is anybody willing to help me?

                              <span>I will be visiting VN next month from Canada. I heard you get a better rate for money exchange if you bring brand new $100 CAD bills as opposed to old $100 CAD bills. Is this true ? Also, where is the best place for money exchange in District 4 of HCMC?

                              <span>Hi Everyone
 I am hoping this is the right place to ask.
 I am currently trying to buy a few products from Vietnam (essentially coffee, that i am not able to find in France or at 5x time the price). I am wondering if someone could help locally or if you know a proxy buying service dedicated to that?
 Most of the Vietnamese website i have tried don’t deliver abroad.
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m from Germany and my gf and her family are from Hanoi. As I have a genuine personal interest in history in general and Vietnamese history in particular, I would like to ask my parents-in-law about their experiences in the American War.
 They are in their early 70s and I know he was a soldier in the NVA. Would it be acceptable to bring this topic up in a respectful way and in an appropriate setting (e.g. during a one-on-one conversation while going for a walk, not at the family dinner table)?
 I&#x27;m asking because - unsurprisingly - WWII is still a touchy topic in Germany. But these two wars are obviously very different, with Germany being the aggressor and committing genocide. My own grandparents never talkes about WWII, although the topic was still always weirdly present in the background.
 I&#x27;ve done a bit of reading beforehand (Last Night I Dreamed of Peace by Đặng Thùy Trâm, The Sorrow of War by Bảo Ninh, The Peguin History of Modern Vietnam by Christopher Goscha) and watched the Ken Burns documentary about the War, so I wouldn&#x27;t be totally ignorant and ask dumb/insensitive questions.

                              <span>Grandfather is name Tuat Van Nguyen born in Hanoi, Vietnam and I believe he grew up in Hanoi, where he was kidnapped on his way to Catholic school. His father was a locksmith. This is all I can gather from him as it is it is a very sensitive topic. We are heading back to Vietnam to search for his parents, or any members of his family, in Saigon and then making our way to Hanoi. I am hoping I can get a head start with some search tips online. It seems the best way to go searching for this would be to look at church records but unfortunately, I need help on the ground. Or any sort of obituary. He seemed to recall one sister. Would it be worth hiring a private investigator? This time we&#x27;re going back in April. I am his first granddaughter 33 years old and will accompany him.
 Both his grandparents lived in Thai Binh, and he lived there with them before he went to school in Hanoi with his parents.
 His father, Yet Van Nguyen
 Mother, Do Thi Nguyen
 Grandfather, Tuat Van Nguyen born 07/15/1935. He did spend some time in Paris, I think when he was about in his 20s. Someone took him under his wing but he left back to Vietnam to search again.

                              <span>Hi everyone - I&#x27;ve spent the last few days combing through all your posts on traveling Vietnam, lots of helpful stuff so thanks to everyone. Currently planning on flying to Hanoi mid Sept, spending a couple days there and bussing to Ha Giang, doing the loop on motorbike then coming back. 
 My bday is at the end of the trip and I&#x27;d like to splurge a little at a luxury-ish resort or something where I can really chill out and be taken care of. From what I&#x27;ve read so far, current top of the list is Da Nang, but just wanted to see if anyone has any other good recs. 
 Wants
 -Remote-ish, not overly touristy but still some kind of town action we can walk to for food, beers, etc.
 -Resort with a pool, preferably overlooking the beach
 -Proximity to other towns/beaches so we can rent scooters and go on little day trips
 Recommendations on Towns or actual resorts would be amazing!

                              <span>When compared to other Sinosphere nations like China, South Korea, and Japan, Vietnamese culture seems more chill. Education is efficient and not stressful while work culture isn&#x27;t as intense. Vietnamese students have more extracurricular activities to do such as football compared to Chinese students who study day and night from the start of life to prepare for the gaokao. Vietnamese suicide rates are much lower than Japan&#x27;s or South Korea&#x27;s.
 What cultural/social/political developments led to Vietnamese culture being more chill?

                              <span>Hi,
 I’m a 25 year old guy, coming from Canada. Will be in Saigon from Feb 13-23, then over to Hanoi.
 I’ll be around the District 1 area (in general, still confirming Airbnb) and I’d like to see if anyone wants to be friends? Or do some tourist things together?
 I love food and would like to try as much as I can around the area! I love experiencing new things, and getting tattoos. 
 I’m also open to any local ideas of things to do around the area, or day trips for motorcycle?
 Send me a DM, or comment!

                              <span>Hello fellow bikers! Has anyone had experience with the Yamaha R15 vs the CBR 150R? I have not fully decided, but I&#x27;m leaning heavily on the smaller 150cc for less weight and fuel economy. I have past experience with 300cc-600cc motorbikes but it doesn&#x27;t make sense to ride the bigger bikes in Vietnam. I&#x27;m looking to ride around town and occasional long rides.
 I&#x27;m open to getting the R3 or Ninja 400 as well.
 Please let me know what your best experiences are and what makes good sense. (Note: I will have an Airblade in case I&#x27;m lazy.)
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi guys, I am going to Vietnam next month, and want to get a few small souvenirs for my landlords (Irish / 70 yrs old). What can be a safe / good choice of Vietnam souvenirs for them?
 Nuoc mam and frigde magnets are not suitable as they don’t use those.

                              <span>Hi F 15
 I wasn&#x27;t raised In n Asian household so I was slowly learning about my Viet culture 
 I went to a Vietnamese restaurant, and I couldn&#x27;t finish all my food, and I felt really bad about it.... because I didn&#x27;t want to leave a bad impression. I heard that it&#x27;s seen as wasting food, and is also disrespectful to the chef in other east Asian cultures just didn&#x27;t know if it was the same for Viet. I feel really bad about it.

                              <span>Long story short: I&#x27;m a Vietnamese foreign student in the States and in the process of waiting for a green card here. My dad got an MBA during the 1990s, and he went back home to work for an insurance company. My mom obtained a law degree in Vietnam and worked in a different field. My question is: what kind of jobs can my parents do? Obviously, I will be the person who helps them start over and climb the social ladder, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t want them to struggle in old age. Can my dad start over and work at a company with his US degree, even though it will take several years to adjust and improve his English? What kind of jobs can my mom do? I have heard a lotta became nail techs, but I&#x27;m unsure if she could handle all the drama and long working hours. I honestly love them so much for all the work they put in to send me here, so at least I want to help them with a new life :( If any of yall in similar boats, I would love to hear yall your experiences!!

                              <span>I’m in Vietnam, Hoc Mon area. I brought plenty of hundreds and some twenties. I have 2 objectives:
  
I need single dollar bills. Where can I change one of my hundreds into a hundred singles. 
 
I understand the quality of usd is very important here; is there a place that will exchange my subpar quality bills for higher quality ones. 
 
 I have a feeling the answer to my question is ‘any large Vietnam bank’ but I want to see if you all have better insight. 
 Thank you very much for your help and advice in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning a Bachelors Motorcycle ride for my brother in April of this year. There will be about 15 riders.
 We are starting in Da Nang and ending in Ho Chi Minh City in the span of 4 days, he gave me a list of must haves for this trip: Hai Van Pass, Rice Fields, and Swimming Spots. 
 Would love to get some recommendations on places to see, things to do, places to eat and places to stay.
 Also, where is a good place to rent motorcycles in Da Nang and return back in Ho Chi Minh (for about 15 people)

 I&#x27;m looking for small breeds like Pom, Bichon... specifically because I live in a small apartments. 
 Another question is, I&#x27;ve heard dog thefts are regular here. Is it safe to walk my dog outside? I live in District 2. 
 Also since I&#x27;m already asking questions, what would be the best dog breed for apartment life? That doesn&#x27;t need too much exercise...walking etc

                              <span>Hallo - I would like to recreate a trip I had in Viet Nam a long long time ago - Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi - but I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble trying to find a few of the places I visited before. If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it. I have most of the journey mapped out but there&#x27;s not much english language travel out there for Thanh Hoa so it&#x27;s hard to find exactly where they are. 
 I remember going to 1) a tourist destination of a river with a lot of fish, and 2) a medium/large busy indoor/outdoor market on the way to Sam Son which had amazing pho and lots of street food. I don&#x27;t remember and apparently didn&#x27;t write down anywhere the names or specific locations of either of these places and google isn&#x27;t helping me. I would love to know if these places still exist and if so exactly where they are :D Any help would be very appreciated, thank you!

                              <span>I’m currently in HCMC and am flying home on Thursday from Hà Nội. I’m assuming that due to new year, the flights direct are both expensive and almost non existent.
 Flight searching tools show most routes stop off at Phu Quoc. On my final day before going to Hà Nội, should I get an early flight to Phu Quoc, spend the day there (with my luggage which could be a pain) and then fly later into Hà Nội. Or am I better off getting flights closer together and spending less time on the island? 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated

                              <span>Xin chao! It is a long time since I were last in Vietnam. I will be here for Tet and I have bought some red envelopes. 
 I would like to give some families/children of families I know some good luck Tet money. Please advise an appropriate amount per envelope / per family for this.
 Also, I believe there is something like a moon cake made from gelatinous rice or mung bean than that is also very traditional. 
 Please advice the name so I can buy. 
 Cam on. Chuc mung Nam moi con meo hai nghin hai ba! 🇻🇳 ✌️ 🕉

                              <span>I&#x27;m Filipino so I have an inkling that we have similar cultures in terms of meeting elders and what not. What should I bring as a gift? I was thinking a Filipino desert but I can also just do a fruit basket.
 How would I address his parents? With Mister and Missus? Or is there a specific term? They are pretty traditional according to my BF, but he isn&#x27;t close to them. 
 I want to put my best foot forward.

                              <span>Is it weird or bad that would want to join the us military as a Viet American? I haven&#x27;t seen or heard of a Vietnamese us soldier before and it feels a little ironic considering the atrocities Vietnamese people have experienced because of the us military.

                              <span>We&#x27;re planning to visit Vietnam in late march for a couple of weeks, we want to spend a week in Hanoi and a week in Ho Chi Minh. I&#x27;d kind of rather play things by ear when we get there, book our flights and hotels now and then when we get there do some things like river tour or an overnight cruise. But I&#x27;m not sure how crucial it is to book those things in advance. When we get there, can we talk to the hotel about booking a cruise or a guided tour or will it be difficult to locate those with short notice?

                              <span>Does anyone here have experience with having shipped a suit from Hoi An with one of the tailors here? If so, do you pay customs and duties when you receive it back home? I’m wondering if I just deal with it and carry a few suits for the next 3.5 months, or if it makes sense to pay the shipping to Canada and then potentially pay the customs and duties on it. 
 I’m not sure how the process works, but it seems like this can be quite an expensive endeavour. Any advice would be appreciated! 
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;ve heard the word rabbit in mandarin sounds like the word cat in Vietnamese but I&#x27;ve also heard folk tales about how the Cat tricked the fast rabbit that the banquet was somewhere else so the cat took its place.
 Just wanted to hear people&#x27;s story so I can share.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m currently planning on a trip to Vietnam and thinking through transportation around the city- specifically grab availability to and from my hotels to the airport. Some of my hotels do offer airport transportation, but I can&#x27;t figure out if their quoted prices are a serious upcharge compared to Grab.
 I&#x27;ve been to other countries before where ride share apps are available, but cars are limited (eg, it takes 30-40 minutes to get a car and the car cancels multiple times.) Is this a cause for concern with Grab in Vietnam?
 Hoping to ask for your insight about transportation and the reliability, availability, and pricing of Grab in:
  
Saigon Airport to District 3 around 11pm: Are cars available at this time? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
 Hanoi airport to old town: I believe I&#x27;ve read on a Reddit thread that the car picking you up is not the one the app promised. Is this still the case? What would the pricing be?
 Halong Bay port to Van Don Airport: This is the one I&#x27;m worried about the most. Is Grab availability quick here? If not, does anyone have recommendations on how to get to the airport? Any companies you use that you recommend?
 Da Nang Airport to Hoi An: Are grabs available and reliable here? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
  
As a female, my primary concern is safety, reliability, and flexibility. Our group is 3 people: will this change the type of car we need for Grab?
 Thank you so much for any insight you can give on any of these cities and your experiences in transportation here! I really really appreciate it.

                              <span>Is there a bus from Hoi An, Da Nang or Hue bound to Pakse? Or do you guys know the easiest way to get to Siem Reap from Da Nang? Plane is out of the options. I prefer bus or train. Thank you! ☺️

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been travelling around Vietnam as a foreigner and it&#x27;s killing me how there are so many elderly walking around working. Some to the point of collecting recyclables.
 Does anyone have thoughts on what can I do to help and raise awareness? There&#x27;s a stigma going on to not help them for fear of scams or something but wth... they are doing what they are doing because they need the money or it&#x27;s their livelihood. 
 What&#x27;s especially bothering me are the tourists! Like what are you doing bargaining with the locals? You have the privilege and luxury of travelling well and stuff, paying a little extra and giving them a better life. 
 Sorry, I was venting a little bit back to the topic, what can I do to help? I&#x27;ve been giving money here and there and it&#x27;s endless. I&#x27;m buying stuff I don&#x27;t need and I don&#x27;t know what to do.

                              <span>Hello!
 So, I&#x27;m suffering from misophonia. Misophonia basically means you react extremely sensitive to some sounds. Not just - I don&#x27;t like that sound - but full on rage / anxiety / panic / fear / aggression triggered immediately upon being subjected to it. It can be conditional though - meaning a sound only triggers that reaction in some context but not in others.
 Sounds like that for me are bass from music (no problem with bass from music I hear myself or when going to a night club but when trying to sleep f.x.). People smacking while eating. 
 Now - why do I direct this question specifically at Vietnamese people and not expats or tourists reading this? Well, Vietnam is a very loud culture and to make things worse sound proofing of buildings here doesn&#x27;t seem to exist. At least I have never &quot;seen&quot; any. Windows especially are always leaking air and because of that sound from outside.
 So, I&#x27;d assume that a misophonically challenged person would be suffering a lot. But, is misophonia even a problem here? Maybe being subjected to very loud sounds all the time since birth provides immunity to it? Do you know of Vietnamese misophonics - are you one yourself? What are your triggers? How do you cope? How do you arrange yourself with it?
 Cheers

 What is the best coffee farm with nice views in the morning, on the way between the airport and Da Lat?
 And what hiking trails do you recommend for awesome views with clouds in the morning, especially if there are some flowers on the fields?
 Do you recommend hiring a driver or simply taking a Grab?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a 1.5 year old who I’m trying to teach some Vietnamese. She currently learns a ton of classic American songs like, “Wheels on the Bus” or “Old Macdonald”. I’ll usually look for the Vietnamese version but it’s just not the same. 
 Are there any classic or kids songs that y’all can recommend?

                              <span>Would it still be worth to do the loop via car instead of motorbike? Anyone have a recommendations for good tour companies? I’ve seen QT and Jasmine mentioned a lot, but after reading reviews, I don’t think they’re the right fit for me. I prefer a small group vs going in a tour with 30 riders
 Side question: are tips expected for tours in Vietnam? I will also be doing son doong cave expedition and wondering if I should tip

                              <span>Hello everybody, my wife and I booked a flight from Vientiane to Hanoi for January 15th through 12go.asia. I made a dumb mistake and put in the wrong last name, her birth name instead of the name she has now after the marriage. After being in contact with support from 12go.asia, they informed me that you have to request the change at least 3 days before departure date. I know it was my mistake but I just can&#x27;t believe that you can&#x27;t change something like this before the flight. Does anybody have experience with this? Could we just show up at the airport and try to change it there? Would we have to cancel the whole booking or could we just buy a new ticket for her and I could keep my booking, even though I made a booking for 2 people? Thanks in advance in case anybody could give me information on this!

 Can I survive with a jacket/ cardigan or do I need a thick coat?

                              <span>Tesla has recently decreased its Model Y prices from $66,000 to only $53,000 and the Model Y Performance now starts at only $57,000 with a 0-60 time of 3.5 seconds and 303 miles of range as well (down from 330 miles on the Base Model Y). With the Vinfast VF 8 still starting at $59,000 despite having less track record than Tesla, what do you now think of the Vinfast VF 8 and what are your opinions of Vinfast now, given the fact the Tesla Model Y is now cheaper (in fact, the 7-seat interior on the Model Y is only $4000 more than the 5-seat interior)?
 I am also curious who would buy the Vinfast over the Tesla Model Y, if any, outside of Vietnam, and what measures Vinfast would need to address to succeed, or they would fail regardless?
 For me, I do think Vinfast should just halve their price to be competitive:
 The Vinfast VF 8 could be $29k trying to steal market share from the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5/CX-50, Hyundai Santa Fe/Tucson, Kia Sorento/Sportage, Nissan Rogue, Mitsubishi Outlander, Subaru Forester, etc.
 The Vinfast VF 9 could be $42k trying to steal market share from the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Mazda CX-9, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Nissan Pathfinder, Subaru Ascent, Chevy Traverse, Ford Explorer, etc.
 I am actually Vietnamese by the way, born in Vietnam and currently living in the US and after seeing Tesla prices drop, if I had to choose between the Tesla Model Y and the Vinfast VF 8, I would choose the Tesla Model Y Long Range. Also, a review of the &#x27;quirks and features&#x27; of the Vinfast VF 8 will be coming soon as I am heading to Montreal this weekend to film a video over at the Vinfast store.

                              <span>I heard this Vietnamese insult it literally translates to &#x27;I&#x27;m your father&#x27; in English. Of course, it has the figurative meaning of &#x27;I slept with your mother&#x27;.
 Does anyone know what the expression is?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I am currently working on writing a novel in which one of the main characters is Vietnamese-American. He was raised in a family culture that is supposed to be relatively traditional as per Vietnamese values and lifestyle, so I&#x27;m trying to do some research into what that looks like, especially in everyday life.
 So here&#x27;s my question: are there any particular details or things I should include to make traditional Vietnamese life feel accurate and respectful? Are there any potentially harmful stereotypes I should avoid? I want to get a more direct authority on the subject than decades old library books and internet articles. Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>1) assuming they have a US drivers license without a motorcycle endorsement.
 2) assuming they have a US license with a motorcycle endorsement.
 Both assumptions would be for a TEFL teacher on a proper visa. I tried searching but I get confused by the conflicting responses (some of which talk about taking a written Vietnamese test).

                              <span>Hi all. Question. I&#x27;m working in a team with people from Viet Nam. Two of them are getting married. My employer wants to know what would be a suitable wedding present in Viet Nam. We are thinking about giving them a bonus of 5 million VND, but what do you think: is that a good ammount, too little or too much? Or is it in general not done to give money for a wedding?

 My girlfriend is Vietnamese, and is not able to travel to her relatives this year for the new year celebration. We live in the United States.
 I visited her family last year to celebrate, but everything was new to me. Money exchange, meals, etc.,
 I want to try and find some items or typical celebratory treats or decorations to help make her feel a little less depressed about missing her family this year. 
 Any suggestions of items i could purchase or meals that are customary? 
 Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks

 Facebook basically ate up every chat log and every low res videos that provided zero context whatsoever, then people started taking it on Reddit and Twitter. I&#x27;ve never laugh so hard on such a clownfest. Heck, I can even pretend to leak a Zalo chatlog saying &quot;Oh I&#x27;m a relative of the two students on the press conference today, they were forced to answer in favor of &quot;the upper people&quot; &quot; and people would gobble them up like a bowl of warm soup.

 Never change, fellow Vietnamese netizens, never change...

 I want to clarify that I do not wish to spread misinformation, but it is important that we put pressure on the military school, the university itself (HUFLIT) and the media to be fully transparent about the situation.
 Many posts on Facebook and Twitter related to this have been removed after the incident blew up on social media.
 According to an official statement in a press conference from the military school, this incident was a conflict between female students, with one of them accused of stealing, causing her to breakdown and scream. Later on, her family came to pick her up.

 I am staying in Da Nang for 3 months and I would like to rent a western motorbike long term.
 Most shops only have the „classic“ vietnamese motorbikes.
 I am looking for something like a Honda Rebel or Honda CBR.
 Do you guys know any shops that have them?

                              <span>I&#x27;m thinking of flying from Australia to Hanoi on a tourist visa, staying 3 weeks
 But because of Tet/covid I&#x27;m not sure. What do you guys think? When would be a good date to travel?

                              <span>Unfortunately it seems it will be taking and cold during my key days in Da Nang. Wondering whether it would be worth changing my flights and perhaps spending time in a different city. 
 Quite disappointed as I was hoping to spend time at the beach, Marble Mountains, etc. Now it looks like it may not be possible, but not sure about accuracy of forecast. 
 Any thoughts? Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m an university student, and though my performance in college the first year wasn&#x27;t bad, my depression has been getting worse and because of COVID-19, I can&#x27;t focus on my studies and work, let alone passing the subject. I tried to talk to my mom about it but her respond was...not the best. I need help and advice, any drop-out or someone who used to be in the same situation can point me the way? (My English is kinda wonky because it&#x27;s like 5AM and i&#x27;m still studying for the upcoming exam)
 I&#x27;m Vietnamese, with very strict parents who decide my whole future and I&#x27;m not allowed to work so I&#x27;m financially depending on them.

                              <span>This is kind of a very niche situation but I figured I&#x27;d ask here. My Fiancée and I are looking to get married in Japan. We&#x27;re both foreigners: I&#x27;m American while she&#x27;s Vietnamese. The process requires a lot of paperwork most of the difficult part coming from her side.
 We&#x27;ve run into a snag where it seems her local Vietnamese government is asking for documentation about me before issuing the documents she needs from them. Though according to her my documents aren&#x27;t required and it&#x27;s just the government being stupid.
 Does anyone here have experience getting the Giấy xác nhận tình trạng hôn nhân and Giấy xác nhận chưa thụ lý đăng ký kết hôn when marrying a foreigner? Did you need documents for them in order to get these documents?

 she was r*p* by 12 male soldiers from military camp, not male students and this is 100% not unprecedented, many similar cases occurred before but have been concealed by Vietnamese officials, including Ministry of Defense
 This is actual the call for help of many students, undergraduates are studying in Vietnam, so many information and images we&#x27;re saving in the public drive. Just want to send to as much as anyone can see for this DISGRACE.

                              <span>[TW - rape, suicide]
 Recently there have been stories on Vietnamese Facebook about female students being supposedly raped by other male soldiers at a military school, where they had to go and stay 2 weeks for military training (which is compulsory for most university students in Vietnam). After the assault, there has also been rumors that 2 of them has attempted to commit suicide, with 1 of them successfully killing herself.
 The first video is the screams during the incident. When the girl screamed for help, it could be heard that one of the guy shouted &#x27;Banh rộng chân ra&#x27;, which roughly means &#x27;Spread your legs out&#x27;.
 The second one is the body being carried away after one of the students committed suicide.
 After the stories went viral on Facebook, the military school published a notice about the subject passing it off as &#x27;internal conflict&#x27; and that &#x27;no harm was caused&#x27;. The official Facebook page of the university (HUFLIT) has posted this document on their offical pages.
 Other images are messages from the fellow students at the school.

                              <span>I love history and I have been living in Ha Noi for 5 years. I recently found out that Ha Dong used be part of a now defunct province called Ha Tay which was absorbed by Ha Noi in 2008 creating the city we know today. I often drive through Nguyen Trai street to Ha Dong and I often wonder what was the actual border between the two cities prior to 2008? Its hard to tell since most of the area between Ha Noi and Ha Dong has been built up over the years.

                              <span>Hello! I have been trying to do my part in learning about Tet. I really love the culture. I was invited this year to go on a trip with my husbands family (who moved here along with my husband from vietnam only a few years ago), to participate in a more cultural lunar new year than their typical. They live in america, and since moving here they just stay home for the holiday. It seems that they are very excited to go on this trip, and i want to show my appreciation in any way possible. There is a strong language barrier between us, we mostly only communicate through my husband. I am wondering, what are some possible gifts i can bring them to show them my appreciation? I have done my research, but as an outsider i do not want to overstep and i feel a little insecure about giving them traditional gifts. I need to know if this is just me. For example, would it be overstepping if i wore a red dress? Or would it excite them that i want to participate like that? Would i be weird if i brought them lucky flowers? Any insight at all would be very appreciated :)

                              <span>I like history, and I also know that the war waged in Vietnam is one of the biggest tragedies in the 20th century. Recently I came to know about a documentary about it made by Ken Burns. I want to know if someone here watched it and what is your opinion on that documentary.
 Edit: I think it&#x27;s somewhat stupid to say &quot;Vietnam War&quot;. Sounds like the fault is yours.

                              <span>I’m travelling next week to vietnam, we are 6 people, how much do you think we should carry cash with us as we have already booked our cruise and hotels with an agency.
 Considering we’ll be drinking and partying a lot.
 Also, is vietnam expensive from 21st to 28th Jan?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are thinking on making the Ha Giang Loop with a group of people (renting motorbikes). 
 Do you know how we could find/form a group that is planning to go there in the same time period? Shall we ask at the rental location maybe?
 Thank you!

                              <span>This year will be the first Tet with my boyfriend, he&#x27;s Vietnamese and I&#x27;m white. He used to celebrate pretty heavily with his immediate and extended family when he was younger, but the whole family has since stopped celebrating like they used to and I want to start up the celebrations again with him this year since I think it could be really nostalgic for him. I plan to decorate and cook, but what about gifts?
 I know that traditionally gifts of money are usually given to younger members of the family, so would it be weird if I got him a gift? I just really love gift giving and will look for any excuse to get him presents, but I don&#x27;t want it to be weird if it seems inappropriate for this particular holiday. If it wouldn&#x27;t be weird, what are some possible gift ideas that would be fitting? He really loves white tea, hates sweet things, and is always appreciative of plants if that helps.
 I remember him fondly reminiscing on the fun of red envelopes, and since it would be kind of awkward to give him money I had the idea of using the red envelopes to make a scavenger hunt for him. Thoughts on this idea? Too weird? Brutal honesty is appreciated, I&#x27;m still learning but it&#x27;s hard to get an idea of what he would enjoy for Tet without spoiling the surprise of all my plans
 Thanks so much for any and all help!

                              <span>I’m specifically trying to find a place in Saigon where I can practice my apnea (breath hold). This involves me lying face down in the water (using a snorkel and mask). Of course this will look odd to anyone who isn’t familiar with freediving and in the few instances I’ve had of actually trying this resulted in either getting shouted at by the lifeguard or they simply don’t allow anything that isn’t circuit or lane swimming. 
 How would I ask about whether I could do some freedive practice on the surface? My practice partner relies on me speaking Vietnamese for stuff but I don’t know how to say this.

                              <span>Our landlady lives on the penthouse of our building, and last year Tet we asked if it was okay to go up to her balcony to watch the fireworks on the eve (you can access the balcony without entering her house). She said of course, (I&#x27;ve tutored her daughters and we&#x27;ve visited together before). Afterwards they invited us in for drinks (it was just my husband and I and her, her husband and kids), and now she says they&#x27;ve had great luck this past year (good health, built a big new house, etc.) so she would like us to be officially invited for the evening this year lol. At the big new house they built. 
 Last time was just spur of the moment. I get a bit overwhelmed about the times during Tet when you do the specific things etc - I was just wondering if I should prepare a gift that would be &quot;lucky&quot;? She&#x27;s always been helpful and friendly to us, but I&#x27;d like to show my appreciation in a culturally appropriate way. For example, I only recently learnt that you can&#x27;t give certain flowers (the yellow chrysanthemum) as gifts, though luckily I&#x27;ve never done that. Would just like to know if there&#x27;s a &quot;special&quot; gift that would be appreciated. Feel quite honored to be invited to be the first into her home in the new year!

                              <span>Hey guys, going to be in Ho Chi Minh for ten days this January. I am a seasoned backpacker and really wanting great food and culture (for context I&#x27;m from Melbourne), I will also be travelling with my mum for a period who&#x27;s VERY Korean but want some nice experiences. Struggling to find a travel blog or anything online I&#x27;m really resonating so hoping this community can give me some insights. 
 Food wise I would love street food, cool bars, places where locals eat and drink, areas where younger tourists go to socialise, where young locals go to socialise. 
 Is it worth doing a few days elsewhere? 
 Sorry, I know i&#x27;m asking a lot but any type of response will be gladly appreciated. Much love!

                              <span>He&#x27;s the guy who was posting those &quot;predator hunter&quot; videos from HCMC. He seemed to be posting pretty frequently up until about 2 weeks ago when everything stopped. No updates from his Facebook page, and his YouTube account seems to have been deleted. I just want to make sure he&#x27;s ok. Although he was doing a good thing, it&#x27;s still a very risky venture in Vietnam. I&#x27;m curious what happened. Does anyone know anything?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I just like to understand a myth that I have been told by my Vietnam wife relative during my trip there in Dec 2022. 
 For context is, the relative open a chocolate shop in Saigon and it isn&#x27;t doing well. She commented that Vietnamese doesn&#x27;t like chocolate as much as coffee.
 Any insights to why choco is less favourable ?

                              <span>I will be traveling to Vietnam with my friends for more than a week in February. We will be staying in Hanoi for 4 days and in Da Nang for 5 days. We already have our stay booked in Hanoi, a cruise in Ha Long Bay and we have a list of places (mostly popular tourist attractions) which we would like to visit. I was hoping if you guys could give any tips and advises for our trip? Is there anything that we must see, any dishes we should try (I am aware of Egg Coffee, Pho and Bun Cha which we can get in Hanoi)? Is there anything that we should be cautious of (any scams etc.)?
 We are all very excited to come to Vietnam and explore it! Any advice will be much appreciated.

Can someone point me to official governmental information on whether travel insurance covering COVID medical expenses are needed to enter the country. The tourism website has an infographic that states it&#x27;s required, but I can&#x27;t find anything elsewhere.

 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I have an odd question. One of my neighbors is Vietnamese, and we live in the United States.
 I&#x27;ve been noticing at night a red light in their living room. They do not have curtains. It looks like 2 urns? And some other things that I can&#x27;t make out. It looks like it&#x27;s in a case of some sort. And there is 2 red lights on at all times, from what I can tell. 
 I was thinking it could be for a reptile, because I was going to offer them some of my old reptile keeping items, but my husband reminded me that they are Vietnamese and it could be a cultural thing. 
 I don&#x27;t want to be rude by assuming, so is this something done in your culture? 
 Thank you all so much!

Unfortunately, tigit motorbikes don’t have any xr150 bikes left until 27th. Are there any other companies similar to tigit in terms of service and quality?

 I am going to Vietnam the 22&#x27;nd, and am very excited! I am however worried, since I only have one shot of hepatitis b vaccine and I need two. Can i get a second in Vietnam?

                              <span>Does anyone know of a prepared meal service in Hanoi that delivers to your house with a pre-arranged menu? I&#x27;m looking for one that offers healthy options (western variety food if possible) with a budget of 100-200K each meal with 3 meals a day.
 I did some research and found some options for HCM such as SmartMeal which looks pretty decent but unfortunately they don&#x27;t operate in HN, if anyone utilizes these services or has any suggestions I&#x27;d definitely appreciate it, cheers!

It is full of vacant nice buildings, a large market with nobody to buy the goods and I think we are the only ones in our hotel. Feels like we’re in a horror movie! What gives? Where is everyone?

                              <span>Hi! I’m travelling to Hanoi this mid March to spend 5 nights as my first ever solo travel! 
 I’m 25f, enjoys nature a lot, meeting people, and good food. I wanted to ask your personal recommendations on which spots I shouldn’t miss? From food, to nearby spots?
 The places I’m eyeing to visit are: - About 1-2 days in Hanoi - Hoi An - Ninh Binh - And Ha Long Bay.
 Questions:
  
Would it be good to spend 1 day in each town?
 What would be a good itinerary?
 Is Ha Long Bay worth it? Other towns you love?
 Food/ restos I shouldn’t miss in these places?
  
Thank you so much! ❤️

                              <span>Hello I am traveling to phu quoc with a group of friends for three nights. We are all around 30 years old. Found two places we really like. One is in duong dong town and the other one is in an thoi at the very southern tip of the island. Which one would be more convenient? We like to eat so does the west side have more restaurants than the south? We will be flying in but plan to do a boat tour to visit surrounding islands also.

                              <span>Pho is one of my favourite dishes. If it is not one of yours then there is something fundamentally wrong with you! I know its sensible to parboil your bones first to remove any impurities and get a clearer broth. However is it acceptable/correct to roast the bones first? This is pretty standard practice when making a broth in the west but I believe in doing things properly.

 In short, China’s epidemiological situation is awful, people getting sick and dying en masse, there are also new strains that they do not report to WHO.

 I went out to the grocery store and some Vietnamese came to and told me he have some “pretty girls” and tried to show me some of their photos. I refused to him of course and went into the store but he took a picture of me and sent it to someone. It was very creepy! Has it happened to someone here? Why did he do that?

 Any suggestions for someone doing this for the first time and not wanting a pre-packaged supermarket basket?

 -Which is the best place to be in northern Vietnam to enjoy the celebration? Hanoi? 
 -Any travel advice for these days? Does everything really close for the holidays? Do some of the tours/tourist attractions still open? 
 Thank you for the advice!

                              <span>What social/cultural/political developments led to Vietnam becoming less authoritarian than China?
 Vietnam has access to Western sites while China blocks most. 
 China cares about policing the internet more than Vietnam, and China cares about policing cultural works than Vietnam. Yes, Vietnamese movies have some serious censorship but at least they can still make ghost movies and homosexual relationship content.
 Vietnamese leaders can more easily accept criticism from their citizens while Chinese leaders are less tolerant of criticism. Vietnam’s security minister was criticized for eating at a Salt Bae restaurant in London and had to resign. In China, many major scandals are heavily censored and covered up.
 What reasons make the Vietnamese government less authoritarian and more humane than the Chinese government?
 If it’s a case of losing authority? Why is the Vietnamese government more prone to make decisions that risk their authority than the Chinese government is?
 Is the higher humaneness of the Vietnamese government stemming from cultural reasons?
 Vietnam is still repressive and has one of the world’s worst press freedom scores, but the fact that they have access to all Western sites and more political accountability is a clear sign that it is much less authoritarian than China.

                              <span>Hello all! I just got engaged two months ago, I’ve been thinking about getting a customized ao dai for both my fiancé and I for our wedding. I’m located in the US and was wondering how much is a customized ao dai over in VT? My mom is currently visiting Da Nang and she went around looking for ao dais and couldn’t find anything to her/my liking, she told me that the colors and prints are for the spring season or for tet. I don’t mind waiting since I’m still planning my wedding, I don’t need it right away but just want to look and find the print and fabric that I like. She also told me the cost for two ao dais are roughly $500-$600 US dollars, does this cost sound right? I told my mom I don’t mind paying for that price but she kept telling me that it’s expensive. If anyone has any recommendations for places for a customized ao dais I would really appreciate it!

 What notes do cash machines give, say on a 1,000,000 withdrawal?
 Is there anyway to get smaller notes (20k, 50k, 100k)?
 Thank you

These articles only talk about how South Vietnam affirmed and exercised its sovereignty on the islands, but they don&#x27;t say anything about what North Vietnam did, not even lips service. Did North Vietnam do or say anything?

                              <span>Hey guys, so I’m travelling to Vietnam next week and there are some things I’m worried about. 
 I’m currently on medication and I’m curious if I’m allowed to bring that into Vietnam? Do I need some kind of receipt or certification from my doctor to prove that the medicine belongs to me? I’m scared they’ll seize it at the airport.
 I’m also a very physically active person, and I plan on working out while I’m in Saigon. I’m taking creatine, and I have been pretty consistent with it so I don’t wanna stop now. I want to bring it to Vietnam but I’m a bit nervous. It’s a white powder. What if they think it’s cocaine and they confisticate it? But I’m guessing they have trained dogs for that?
 Maybe I’m taking this too seriously. I’m on vacation and I should enjoy it, and not think so much about the gym. What do you guys think?

                              <span>I’ve lived in Hanoi for around 5 months. I have thick hair, but it constantly falls out now. My bathroom floor is covered in hair. I’ll run my hands through my hair and strands will come out. I lived in the US before this and never had hair issues. I use a water filter in my shower and take great care of my hair. 
 Is this normal? Any tips?

                              <span>I am trying to recall some of the stuffs I have read during this period of time. Some of the literature was of Viet origin. But some wasn&#x27;t. I finally remembered series like Animorphs, Ngũ quái Sài Gòn, etc.
 In particular, I recalled reading some teen mystery/detective book. I could have been written before the 90s. But I remember reading it in the late 90s to either 2000/2001. There is not much more to go on. Outside of the fact that I know it isn&#x27;t Sherlock Holmes, Detective Conan, or TKKG (another series that I was searching for). Hope you guys can help. Thank in advance. I am sure there should only be a handful of series and or books about teenage detectives during this time.

 thank you for the feedback

                              <span>Hey forum! I’ll be travelling Vietnam and it’s neighbouring countries on a motorcycle for a couple months and currently finalising some approximate financial figures. To those of you who have done something similar or “in the know”, how much should I budget for motorcycle maintenance/reparations? FYI, I’ll most likely be travelling on a Honda wave 110 or future 125, averaging approximately 150km/day for shy of 120 days.

                              <span>Planning on visiting the country Wed Jan 25-Feb 6. Planning on hitting Hanoi, Ban Gioc waterfall and surroundings, Halong Bay, and Hue/Da Nang/Hoi An. The timeline seems a little rushed, and it would be nice to leave the weekend before. Unfortunately taking more time off afterwards isn&#x27;t an option due to work deadlines, so it would have to be before. But since Tet is on Jan 22, would it be a waste of two days of PTO to leave on Jan 21 instead of Jan 25, since everything might be closed?

                              <span>I know that this is a very long shot, but:
 Do you have any suggestion for local independent or underground culture, especially in HCMC and Hanoi? Artist run spaces and collectives, experimental music (new music, noise, electronic, performance/sound art), cultural/social projects for local independent artists and musicians, queer communities, etc? 
 Although I won&#x27;t miss some obvious touristic spot I would like to see and support some of the local scene. Never been in Vietnam so I don&#x27;t know what to expect :) 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m in Hanoi with my fiancee and we&#x27;re looking for a USB C to HDMI cable so I can connect my phone to the TV at the hotel we&#x27;re staying at. I&#x27;ve gone to a few shops in the Old Quarter and came back empty.
 I&#x27;ll be away until Monday evening but would love if there&#x27;s a way to order one and have it shipped to the hotel on the weekend or Monday. The concierge at the hotel tried but was unsuccessful.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello friends! Next week I’m travelling to Vietnam with my mother and we’ll be staying there for three weeks. Last time I went to Vietnam was in 2015 so I’m pretty excited. 
 We’ll be spending the first week in Saigon, second week at my grandparents to celebrate Tet, and the third week in Phu Quoc Island. 
 There is one thing I’m worried about and that’s losing my phone. I’m worried about getting it stolen while in Saigon. It’s pretty crowded there so I’m a bit paranoid. 
 My phone is super important to me so I don’t wanna lose it. I’ll be wearing a fanny pack and I want to take a lot of photos and record videos while I’m there. 
 That’s also the problem. What if someone walks past me and snatches my phone while I’m recording? Or if someone on a motorcycle drives by and snatches it.
 When I was in Vietnam in 2015, I was just a child so I didn’t have a phone at the time so there was nothing to worry about. Anyone got some advice? What should I think about? 
 I’d also appreciate suggestions on nice restaurants and places to visit!

Stories of foreigners who became enamored with our culture and love the country are often highlighted, but I wanna shift the focus on my fellow natives

                              <span>I have the dreaded midnight flight out of HCMC, and need a place to stow (sp?) luggage and take a nap/ last shower...etc. 
 Do Half-Day Hotels exist or am I better off just getting a cheapie budget hotel for a full night&#x27;s pay? Silly question but you never know what Redditors can offer up.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an ESL teacher and mental health youth worker 
 Just wondering if there&#x27;s any good places to look into volunteering? I&#x27;m open to anything, just will have a bit of free time on my hands.
 But don&#x27;t really want to pay for the experience, prefer somewhere in or near Hanoi.

                              <span>What kind of clothes(jackets or cardigans)? Is it really cold in Hanoi? 
 
Suggest me some amazing clubs near Halong Bay or Da Nang maybe. 
 
I’ll be 2 days in Ha Long Bat, 2 Days in Hanoi and 3 days in Da Nang, what all should I keep in mind.
 
Some amazing adventure sports as we are a group of 6 guys travelling.
 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’d like to hear your opinion on the Future 125 vs the XR150 to travel Vietnam. I won’t be doing any off road trails and plan on travelling the north and venturing into Laos and Cambodia after. 99% of the time I’ll be travelling without a passenger. I’m 185cm(6’0) &amp; 75kg(165lbs); I’ll be carrying around 10kg of luggage. I’m leaning towards the future 125: It’s semi auto, lighter than the 150 and the parts are more widely available. Is the 125 sufficient or would you recommend the 150?

                              <span>Hi all, me and my partner are coming to vietnam in February and are pretty prepared, but still unsure about what vaccinations are totally necessary as there&#x27;s so much variation across different sources. We are currently up to date with Hep A, Tetanus, Rabies and Typhoid, as well as the usual vaccines you get as a child in the UK (Mumps, Measles, Rubella, Polio, HPV) Is there anything else that anyone would recommend? We can&#x27;t currently find anywhere that is offering Japanese Encephalitis vaccinations, so I&#x27;m also wondering if we will be safe to travel without this one? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I will be graduating this semester (in IT) and long term I would like to do a working holiday in Australia and after it work in Vietnam. The reasons why is that I want to become more fluent in Vietnamese (my skills are okay; I can say basic stuff but they aren&#x27;t great) and have the experience of living in Viet Nam. I do plan to travel to Viet Nam for a month before all of this. I also want to have experience with living in other countries. 
 I am not sure if I am delusional so please tell me if I am. I am taking italki courses as well as a Vietnamese class at my university.
