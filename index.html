 I’m arriving at Noi Bai airport from Thailand on airasia around 14:50 on a tuesday in august. Will it take more than one hour from deplaning to being outside the terminal? I am planning on checking a bag as well.
 Any insight is appreciated:)

                              <span>I will be moving to Hanoi at the end of August and I&#x27;m wondering about the dating scene there.
 Ideally, I&#x27;m looking to build something serious but not necessarily with a local. I&#x27;m rather Western European in my expectations and ways. . . 
 My questions are roughly. . .
  
if you found your significant other in Vietnam, how/where was that?
 
how is the dating process? (I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s extremely slow) Are the kind of locals willing to move faster and/or hook-up, the same kind that you&#x27;d want to date or not at all?
 
from dating apps: first dates as coffee dates or wine/cocktail dates? Or something else? (I never invite ppl over directly from apps - I need to feel a personal connection first and also for safety reasons)
 
is going to a bar/club alone a thing? Or only some clubs/bars are good for this?
 
ultimately, where do you meet people and socialize? I tend to do a lot of &quot;expat event&quot; kind of things but, depending on the country, the ppl that show up are not necessarily the nicest.
 
would it be very limiting to try and date only other expats?
 
finally, what pitfalls you&#x27;d warn another foreigner about?
 
 No need to answer each and every. I just want to get an overall impression of what to expect.

                              <span>I was browsing some of the Vinfast model and apparently on top of the price for the vehicle itself, you have to buy the battery or pay a monthly subscription for it. That sounds like it going to be more expensive than normal motorcycle.
 Is this popular/economical?

                              <span>Hello~
 So I&#x27;ve heard that pho is can be prepared very differently depending on what area of Vietnam you are in, so I had the idea of doing a whole-country pho tour later this year. Start at the top/bottom and make my way to the other side while trying pho (and other food of course) in different cities.
 So I have a few questions, especially for people who have more experience with Vietnam and trying food in different areas of the country!
  
Do you think this is a fine idea, or a waste of time? Is pho really that different depending on what part of Vietnam you are in, or is it mostly the same?
 Which areas (or specific restaurants) would you recommend I try for a complete experience?
 Are there any other regional foods that you recommend I try on this journey?
  
I will be trying to document as much of this as possible, so I will definitely come back with my thoughts and feedback on how different they actually were, my favorites, etc!

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to visit Vietnam since I was 6 years old. About 5 years ago my parents divorced and my dad figured it was time to go back to Nha Trang. Last week I received news that he had fallen incredibly ill so I booked a last minute trip to Vietnam to visit him for about 3 weeks. Although this isn&#x27;t exactly a vacation as I plan on helping to care for my dad, I&#x27;m sure there will still be plenty of opportunities to go exploring and get back in touch with my Vietnamese heritage.
 Given that I haven&#x27;t gone by since I was 6 and that I&#x27;m from California, I really have no idea how to prepare. What should I bring? What should I be cautious about? What are some dos and don&#x27;ts? I&#x27;m a pretty open-minded eater and literally wish to try all the things. Any recommendations?
 Other things about me:
 My Vietnamese is decent, I understand the southern accent very well and can get by in terms of speaking, but things get a little rough if the other person has a northern accent. If the other person has a central accent, no way lol. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t read Vietnamese either.
 I&#x27;m terrible at dealing with the heat but can manage if I have to.
 I&#x27;m not taking days off work and plan to work (I&#x27;m a software engineer director) as well. How&#x27;s the coffee shop scene over in Nha Trang?
 Any recommendations on what I must do over there on this last minute unplanned trip would also be appreciated!

 Currently we are planning on visiting HCM City, Thap Cham, Hoi An, Danang and Hue.

                              <span>What are some of y’all’s favorite metal bands? Who are some good bands from over there in Vietnam. I think it’s only fair being from the states that I reccomend some bands from out my way so here’s a few:
 The ghost inside, white chapel, lamb of god, and Greta van fleet (this one isn’t metal but they’re still an amazing band)

We considered Phuket, but don&#x27;t want to leave Vietnam if we don&#x27;t have to. We&#x27;ve looked into many beaches, but see so many conflicting opinions.
 Any recs?

                              <span>Hello!
 I was offered a job in market research for a big international corporation that has an office in HCM.
 I&#x27;m from Romania and I saw on Numbeo the comparison between my city (Bucharest) &amp; HCM, but an advice from people living there would be very helpful. 
 I would want to rent a 1 room apartment/studio in district 1, 5 or 10, which are close to my job. I don&#x27; want a luxurios life style but I would probably eat out often, go in bars, experience the local culture, travel and overall want to live a confortable life. Not be very aware of every dollar spent.
 Is it enough 1000$ to do all that (pay rent, travel in vietnam, eat out, drink, local transport, groceries, etc,)?

To be clear, I DO NOT currently have a visa, but I will be overstaying for 2 days (17 days in total, had mistakes with e-visa application) and want to know what has happened with other people and their experiences when trying to exit Vietnam.
 Will I have to pay a fine and how much? Will I get a mark on my passport and not allowed to re-enter Vietnam?
 Any advice would be appreciated, many thanks.

I’ve applied for a new Visa that will only come after my entry. What are the attitudes toward this? Would I be able to just purchase another Visa at Immigration without much hassle? Or will I be okay and my other visa can come whilst I am still there. 
 Thank you!

 Is Grab reliable in nin binh? I went to Mua cave today and had to walk a few km outside of the cave to get a Grab because there was none in my area haha
 Also! I know I will be getting scammed when going into no name taxis, but I saw them earlier, is it still safe to go with them despite paying a higher price?

                              <span>Hello! I have been in Vietnam for a month now, and want to learn the language better as I want to have better interactions with locals and respect their land. I want to show the people here that I’m not a foreigner who only speaks English.
 Here’s the thing - I’m doing job interviews at the moment trying to get a job, but have limited money at the moment. I did a trial lesson at a centre, and after the lesson they asked if I wanted to pay for my tuition fees then and there. The fees were 19.6 for 80 hours (I believe?) but I told them I don’t have the money for it currently due to finding work and not employed. I really want to start learning as soon as possible, but really struggle with apps such as Duolingo and resources like YouTube. I can’t learn anything from there - I get super distracted because of my ADHD and prefer in-class.
 Do you have any suggestions, or should I just wait until I start getting a salary and have more money? It’s making me a little sad that I only speak English and want to learn the language because I feel like I’m experience 1/50th of the life here…

                              <span>Greetings. 
 My wife is currently holds a U.S. green card but she is a Vietnamese citizen. She went to Vietnam in the beginning of May to visit her family after graduating and starting her job in August. She figured while she was there she would renew her passport (Expired in June of 2023). Unknown to us that there’s a shortage issue with the newer ID there and she can only renew her passport using that newer ID. It’s been a month and a half, there’s no sign of her getting the ID. Is there something she can do so that she can return back to the U.S. more urgently? Or rather what’s the average wait time for the ID to get processed, printed, and shipped? For future planning. 
 Thank you in advance.

I will be living with a host family in Hanoi for the next year and I was wondering what is an appropriate gift to bring them according to the customs of the culture. It is a middle aged couple, husband and wife, no young children. Any recommendations are appreciated. Thank you! 
 Xin chào! Tôi sẽ sống với một gia đình chủ nhà ở Hà Nội trong năm tới và tôi đã tự hỏi đâu là một món quà thích hợp để mang chúng theo phong tục của văn hóa. Đó là một cặp vợ chồng trung niên, chồng và vợ, không có con nhỏ. Bất kỳ khuyến nghị được đánh giá cao. Cảm ơn bạn!

                              <span>Hi everyone. I’m scheduling to vist Danang for 4 days next week. The weather forecast is saying that it’ll rain every single day while I’m there. What the rain looks like it Danang? Will it rain hard and long or just pouring down and stop? I’m a bit disappointed with the weather, to be honest. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Well duh... It&#x27;s south east Asia in June! 
 I&#x27;m used to colder temperatures (19 Celsius) so hanoi was a big contrast. I like to go about early mornings and it&#x27;s a lovely city. I was told &quot;oh you&#x27;ll get used to it&quot;. I noticed some of yall seem cool as a cucumber out in the unshaded areas, not a drop of sweat. Then I see others with fans out. Then I see others bolting into air conditioned buildings just drenched. How are y&#x27;all handling this heat? I&#x27;ve been handling it by just putting my hair up, going out and about earlier in the mornings, hydrating, fan and something to wipe my sweat up from my vitiligo&#x27;d face.

 I’ve signed up for a tour around Hue and surrounding areas tomorrow with a guy who approached us on the street. He had a photo album and multiple books of hand written testimonies, all very positive!
 I’m now just wondering, was that kind of a dumb thing to do, not going through an official tour operator or is this kind of normal? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I plan to stay and work (write) in Vietnam for a month. The earliest I can go is mid-October and the latest I can return is the first week of January. I want to mainly stay in one place. I&#x27;d really like to hit the beach maybe every second day as well. 
 Is there any place that will have decent whether in Vietnam during this time, is good for digital nomads (mostly cafes or co-working spaces that are good for laptop -work) and near a beach?
 I initially had planned to go to Da nang but now read that the weather will be very wet

                              <span>Hi r/vietnam. I will be visiting HCM next week and I&#x27;m planning to buy a Samsung phone because it&#x27;s cheaper there than here in the Philippines where I live. I was initially planning to order it online and have it delivered to Bitexco Tower or any nearby branch but I can&#x27;t proceed with the website order page. From step 2 shipment details, it doesnt proceed to step 3 select payment. So I might just check and buy it in the actual Samsung Store. Is it true that you cannot buy in the Bitexco branch? The other nearest to my hotel is the 134 Nguyen Thai Hoc St. branch. Anyway, can anyone check the latest price of Samsung S23+ in HCM? I just wanted to check if it&#x27;s the same as the one in store. Also, if this is the wrong sub to post this inquiry, please help me identify the correct one.
 Since I&#x27;m already here, any tips on my upcoming trip? Previously went to Hanoi already. Can anyone perhaps help me identify the correct sequence of how I should plan my route/itinerary to visit the most famous spots in the city? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Was talking with my partner about maybe going to a Japanese place to eat with their little brother, but I wasn’t sure if the little brother would necessarily like the place. I then asked, “Does he know how to eat it?”
 And my partner seemed to be quite confused. They were just kind of like, “Yes, he knows how to use chopsticks?? And you just chew and swallow??”
 There seems to be some confusion since I directly translated, “Biết ăn không?” into English as opposed to saying something like “Oh would this fit his palette?”
 So my question is- how would you go about translating/explaining “biết ăn không?” to someone who doesn’t speak Vietnamese?

 I was wondering if someone could give me some advice on how to get from Siem Reap to Ho Chi Min City? Or what stops would be necessary along the way (like border crossing) to make it without breaking the bank? Options for busses seem pretty limited and but doable price wise, any suggestions would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m an English teacher who&#x27;s been living in HCMC for about 5 month&#x27;s now and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the experience living here.
 But since I&#x27;ve visited all of the main sights like Palace of reunification, war remnants museum, Landmark 81 and a few temples in D5, I&#x27;m getting quite bored and I want to find other things to do here.
 I plan on going to other parts of the country but at the moment I only work in the evening during the week so it makes it harder to find time when looking at traveling around Vietnam.
 What can anyone recommend to do here? Any hidden gems?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I assumed they were pro-France because 1. the South Vietnamese government was backed by France 2. I think a third of France&#x27;s army in the Indochina War were Vietnamese who relocated to the South. 3. they have a Catholic majority.
 But from talking to South Vietnamese supporters it sounds like they also hate France too. Yet the French flag was raised throughout South Vietnam. Did the South Vietnamese want to expel ALL foreign occupiers or did they want joint cooperation? Was the North more nationalistic than the South?
 To me the North sounds a lot more like the American founding fathers and the South were more interested in neocolonialism.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Going to have a 13hr25min layover at Ho Chi Minh airport. 
 However, it&#x27;s an overnight layover between 9:25pm to 10:50am the next day and I can&#x27;t get a day tour or visiting tourist attractions because of that. 
 So, what&#x27;s your suggestion? Maybe I can go to some night street market before 12 then head to some bar/clubs or hotel? What are the places that I can go at late night to look around? 
 Thanks a lot

                              <span>I live a great life in the U.S. but as I am sitting at work, I still think about moving back to Vietnam or how to do so in the future. This obsession has been going on for years now.
 I&#x27;m aware of all the pros and cons, it&#x27;s just that I have this strange yearning to be there. My mom passed away last year and her family is still in Vietnam. We are very close and I want to live near her family before they all pass away as well. They are one connection I have left with her.
 The main issue is that I won&#x27;t be able to get more than 3-4 weeks vacation off each year from work, and tickets will cost around 8k now. The flight is so long too just for a trip where we&#x27;ll be spending at least one week with jetlag and stomach issues. Plus, my wife wants to go on vacations/beaches while I just want to near Quan 7 with the relatives.
 I&#x27;ve thought about moving to Orange County or Houston to ease this feeling, but those Vietnamese cities just don&#x27;t feel the same. 
 I know the future is far brighter in 15 years for the family if I stay in the U.S., I just feel sad each day working. I spend hours thinking about having enough money to live in Vietnam without worrying about the future.
 It&#x27;s not rose-tinted glasses either, I worked remotely and had lived in Vietnam for 6 months recently with my wife/child. It was great. I know education and healthcare might be a problem later on. Waking up early for coffee and breakfast while watching the crazy traffic, going out to eat seafood/hot pot at night - that just can&#x27;t be beaten.
 I suppose I&#x27;m just ranting and being too greedy. I can always get a significant pay cut/career limitation and get a remote job to live in Vietnam. It&#x27;s just that I want what&#x27;s best for my family/kid&#x27;s future as well.
 Does anyone(especially the Viet Kieus) feel the same way?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m staying in Saigon for one month (work) and need to see some greenness.. am desperate to go to cat tien but am not keen on turning up at the bus station without knowing the times (i&#x27;ve seen Mien Dong Bus Station to cat tien is direct?). 
 Anyone know how I can find out the bus times,, &amp; any reccomendations for places to stay would also be really appreciated ((was thinking cat tien eco backpackers hostel ?) . Im travelling alone and have been put off of homestays after being put in a room on my own with a v creepy man,, so I&#x27;d prefer to share a room with a few people at least. 
 Any general advice would be really appreciated (ie. things you&#x27;ve done there and loved - nighttime jungle watch ?.. waterfalls, etc?)) ++ I &lt;3 hiking 
 :) Thank you !

                              <span>I’ve read so many “guides” that say stay away from ice in VN, but considering 99.9999999999% of beverages here contain ice, how realistic is this? Is this just another example of holier-than-thou western privilege speaking, or is ice-borne illness actually something to be concerned about? Especially curious what locals think.

                              <span>Hi everyone. Do you also consider the people of Champa as your ancestors or only the kinh people, becuase I have read that the Champa people were assimilated when Champa was conquered by Dai Viet. Viet culture such as clothingsetc were imposed on them. This means that south vietnam people are also related genetically to the austronesians (PH, IND, MLY). Is the Champa civilization also taught in schools as a part of vietnamese culture?

                              <span>A parent named Le Mau Duyen has been fined 6.5 million VND for physically assaulting his child&#x27;s teacher. The assault was alleged because the child received the teacher&#x27;s &quot;average conduct&quot; rating.
 This assessment was given to the student due to an incident where the student insulted the teacher after arriving late to class. The parent, persistently blaming the teacher for hindering their child&#x27;s enrollment in police schools, where “good level” conduct is required, finally resorted to physically attacking the teacher.
 In Vietnam, students are evaluated based on their academic performance and conduct, using a system with four levels: Good, Fair, Average, and Weak.
 What do you think about it?

                              <span>My Vietnemese girlfriend and I recently had a baby, who was born in Vietnam. We both want our child to have her Western first-name and my family name as her last name listed on her Vietnemese birth certificate.
 I have read on the Consulate website that if we provide documentation that we are obtaining a CRBA for US citizenship for our child, that we can follow the US naming standards on our child’s Vietnemese birth certificate.
 Has anyone had experience with this? Thank you in advance!

 Has anyone ever done that? Was there any trouble with customs/tax, etc at all?

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning to have eye laser surgery done in Saigon but not sure how safe it is to do it here, considering it is considerably cheaper than in the west. 
 Also which hospitals are trustworthy? A few people recommended Benh viet mat Sai Gon which seems to be owned by the government and has done a lot of surgeries. 
 I was also wondering whether I should go for the lasik option (cost like 20m VND) or Relex smile (50m vnd). Relex smile supposed to have faster recovery time and fewer complication risks but require a skilled surgeon, which again I&#x27;m not so sure

                              <span>My wife and I just returned from a month long trip in Vietnam and her hometown of Saigon. We had an amazing time. Now that we’ve been home in the states for 2 weeks she just got a call from a number her caller ID says was the Vietnamese Embassy. They claimed that someone was using her name/info in Vietnam to scam people and that she needed to work with the police in Vietnam to clear her name. They transferred her to a police station in Vietnam and the police officer used Viber to video talk with my wife in full uniform. She declined when he started asking for passport information. He said if she does not trust it she can investigate herself or find another way to have it investigated. Has anyone got a call like this before? The phone numbers check out online but this just screams scam to me. Just looking for advice and how to move forward with this?

 I’m not interested in the ‘tagging’ I see everywhere. I like big colourful artworks that people put a lot of time and effort into.

                              <span>Hi, guys I arrived 5 days ago, and have not went to 💩 since then. I drink plenty of water, i tired drinking ice, coffee,coconut water, avocado, fruits…anything you can imagine that someone should avoid for food poisoning…nothing is helping me. Are laxatives here too strong for western people?

                              <span>I have visited some smaller towns with my friends in central/northern Vietnam in the past few days and we just can not understand how do all the small businesses make any money. Right now we are in Mộc Châu and there are so many restaurants and hotels everywhere, but basically no guests anywhere. How can the people even afford to pay the electricity bill?

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m sorry for the silly question, but I&#x27;m currently at the transit area of Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Ho Chi Minh City and looking for some food options that are suitable for vegetarian. 
 Saw this Veggie and Cheese Burger at the Burger King. I&#x27;m wondering if this suitable for vegetarians? No animal fat or meat. I&#x27;m okay with eggs. Should I just get the fries instead? Hope someone can comment.

                              <span>So I have lived in Ha Noi for 5 years and I have visited Saigon many times but I have always been interested in why Saigon doesn&#x27;t seem to have an architetural equivalent to the Hoan Kiem and Ba Dinh in Ha Noi(even parts of Ha Dong old town in fact)
 The thing that gets me is that Saigon always had more french influence then Ha Noi. It was directly governed by Paris as opposed to the rest of Vietnam which was under harsher colonial rule. It was the center of french colonial life in Indochina with the French having their tennis clubs and Rugby teams.
 Yet I haven&#x27;t seen as many old french mansions(of course there are lots of old government buildings but less so then Ha Noi)

 In order to have enough time for the Ha Giang loop, I&#x27;m thinking of cutting out Ninh Binh or Cat Ba? Which one should I not pass up?
 Hanoi, Sapa, and Ha Giang are the other places planned. Open to any thoughts

                              <span>...in a good way. Maybe I sound like the typical tourist, but I&#x27;ve been here three weeks after flying in from India as a solo woman traveller. Everything from the food to the people are top notch. I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s because I come from a country where women who drink and smoke and walk the streets late at night are perennially unsafe, but being here is simply so liberating. I haven&#x27;t travelled the world much, but I&#x27;ve been to the Middle East, Singapore, and Germany, and none of them compare. Being here is a cultural shock in a good way.
 I know this post is vague, but I just wanted to say thank you so much wherever I could and to whomever I could, hence me doing so here. Vietnamese people are the warmest, most down to earth people I&#x27;ve come across 🙏🏽 I hope to keep visiting and learn the language someday.

 TLDR: Is buying real estate in Vietnam a good idea? How to convey to parents that I want to focus on buying a house in the US instead of Vietnam? and that also I&#x27;m getting married?
 Context:
 I am 28 years old, the firstborn son of Vietnamese parents. I moved over to the US for college, luckily got a job, and currently live in a Very High Cost of Living city in the US (think Silicon Valley, New York, DC, Boston etc.) earning 100k salary. I have my gf (also Vietnamese) living with me and my company is in the process of applying for my Green Card (US Permanent Resident) while I&#x27;m on H1B visa. My parents (mum 50, dad 5…</span>

 Right now I use a workaround at translate.google.com using their English symnonyms feature and then look for Vietnamese words for those words but it&#x27;s quite timeconsuming and sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t work (no symnonym for either English or Vietnamese listed).

How’s the situation now? Should it be something to worry about? If so, would I be better off heading to central/southern regions? Thanks!

                              <span>Sorry if this is a stupid question but tomorrow is my last day in this beautiful country and I want to spend a good portion of the day relaxing and sipping on cold and sweet coconut water in a chilled out spot that has AC. Hope I don&#x27;t sound weird. I don&#x27;t get coconut water in my country and I&#x27;m obsessed with it. This picture is from today&#x27;s visit to Pho Viet Nam. Pho was great but that coconut was amazing. PS. I&#x27;m in district 3 near vuon chuoi market but don&#x27;t mind taking grab. Thank you.

                              <span>Does anybody know somewhere in HCMC that will accept Scottish banknotes to exchange for VND? Unfortunately the money I brought with me on this trip is all Scottish banknotes as that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m from, and so far the banks and jewellery stores are looking at it like it&#x27;s Monopoly money 😩 Any help would be appreciated thank you!

                              <span>I live in Vietnam. I went back home and when I came back to Vietnam I brought some souvenirs and gifts. Nothing special. I was brought up &quot;minimalist&quot;. I never bought fancy gifts for my partners, friends, and family. So, why would I do that to people who are, well, at the periphery of my friendzone?
 And all in all: Isn&#x27;t it the thought that counts?
 Anyhow, my gifts received some harsh comments. For instance, a Vietnamese friend got some brand clothes from Europe. I bought some toys for his younger brother. Do you know Playmobil? A bit like Lego. I confess, the two toys (a Wild-west Fort and a Pirate ship) were on discount. But they cost about 100$. That is more than I gave to my bf for Christmas, LOL. Anyhow, I can survive that a 10yo doesn&#x27;t say thankyou and is happy. But my friend said, that his brother was disappointed because he wanted some more &quot;valuable&quot;.
 I am not on a paylevel which enables me to throw around with MacBooks and Iphones. I do not have such devices neither.
 Another time I was invited and I bought a 25$ red wine bottle. In my home country Germany that would already be too much. Most guests will spend about 10-15$. No one really awaits a 1,000$-bottle of Rothschild stuff.
 Anyhow, the host was quite rude. During the evening he showed my bottle, made a gesture like vomitting and put it aside. Then he presented a fancy Whiskey bottle and told everyone that the bottle was about 200$. This person was not even close to me, so why would I pay 200$ for some alcohol? I am in general a generous guy, but these two examples (there are quite more in my experience) are really too much. I understand, I am the &quot;rich&quot; foreigner. But they cannot really await that I come of dozens of Iphones, cars, laptops? I feel really sad, since my personal life is not circling around consumption.

We do the bo tom nuong on a griddle with butter or crab or whatever. I can’t think of anything else and I’m definitely not making pho because my family owns a pho restaurant. Maybe banh xeo. I’m on a bit of a time crunch so anything helps!

This time, I am planning on exploring by myself without a guide. My worry is that I am very awkward talking to people who aren&#x27;t my parents, and I constantly feel like my vietnamese is at a 6 year old&#x27;s level. Is there any conversation etiquette that I should be of prior to going? 
 I&#x27;ll be staying at the Thanh Tai hotel (closest to airport) next week. Are there any recommendations on where I should go, any tips for walking about etc? I&#x27;ll be in HCM for a week. Thanks

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m planning to travel to Hanoi, Nimh Binh, Halong Bay and Sapa during the last 2 weeks of December this year. &#x27;
  
Does it make sense to travel this way - Hanoi to Nimh Binh, Nimh Binh to Halong Bay, then back to Hanoi for a night before heading to Sapa. From Sapa back to Hanoi again to fly out of Vietnam.
 Would the water be too cold to go into the beach in late December? 
  
Many thanks for reading.

                              <span>As a native, I struggle to find something truly captivating within our local art scene. Mainstream stuff is extremely low-brow, while art-house offerings often appear nonsensical and lacking substance. Many galleries and events rely almost exclusively on foreign funds like the Goethe Institute. I&#x27;m curious about the differences between our art scene and those of other developing countries. Is there a way to bridge this gap and create artistically profound and entertaining art, similar to what filmmakers like Bong Joon Ho and Park Chan Wook have achieved in Korea?

                              <span>Hello r/Vietnam. I was wondering for mixed Vietnamese/American couples has anyone successfully registered a western name for the American citizenship? From what I understood the CRBA follows the name on the Vietnamese birth certificate however, id like my kid to have a western name if possible not a Vietnamese name on the American citizenship. I’m perfectly fine with a Vietnamese name on the Vietnamese citizenship due to the naming laws. Cheers

Are there any local clubs for playing sports or other similar activities? Looking to make some new friends. 
 
Does anyone recommend a place to get a custom motorcycle? I would like to get something around 250cc or more because I plan to do a lot of riding around the country.

Suddenly, my father kept asking me which job and career should I choose after done high school and at that point, I don’t know anything about that nor thinking about that. I don’t have any talents and does not have any career or job. Then he is asking about the future. Asking above the sky and things that I don’t even know. What should I do in this situation? Should I argue with my parents or doing something else?

                              <span>Me and my wife went to cinema to see new Spider-Man Across the spider-verse. During the movie 4 teenagers came and started talking about random stuff while using their phones next to us. Then in the middle of the movie they left. 
 I find it very disruptive. I wonder why people buy tickets when they don&#x27;t even want to watch the movie in the first place. The theater also didn&#x27;t have loud sounds so we could hear everyone in the room talking loud about something else except the movie.
 Is it common for vietnamese people to talk too loud during movies in cinema?

                              <span>Hello! A friend and I are going to be in Hanoi for 10 days in July, and we were planning on spending 5 days in Hanoi, a day trip to Ninh Binh and the last 3 nights in Ha Long Bay, but we&#x27;ve been seeing threads on how Ha Long is deserted and there&#x27;s no point in staying the night there.
 Can someone please provide some clarity on whether this is true and too much time in Ha Long? Taking an overnight cruise is a little outside our budget so we&#x27;re not keen on that, especially given that one of us is prone to seasickness. Would it be better to spend a couple of days elsewhere in the north? If yes, where should we be going?

                              <span>Mình năm nay 2k5 sắp thi đại học tuy đã đậu học bạ nhưng điều đó không làm mình hết áp lực thi cử mặc dù mình học không tệ nhưng cũng không hẳn là giỏi. toán mình đã luyện đề 2 tháng nay nhưng không tiến bộ được tí nào vẫn mãi ở 8 điểm(chua có tính khoanh lụi). Nguyên nhân khiến mình áp lực và thất vọng có lẽ là vì mình đã làm &quot;vua chột trong xứ mù quá lâu&quot; và được bạn bè, thầy cô, cha mẹ cho là giỏi suốt những năm đi học mãi tới sau này mình mới nhận ra điều này, Mình mới dùng reddit vì cũng chả biết chia sẻ với ai nữa. Em biết điểm số bây giờ không còn quan trọng nữa nhưng em vẫn thấy khó chịu ấy ạ, kiểu trước giờ luôn nghĩ mình có một cái gì đặc biệt nhưng thực ra lại rất bình thường và khi nhận ra điều đó làm em khó chấp nhận ấy ạ.

                              <span>Hi! I will be backpacking soon and I have plans to travel from HCMC to Dalat by bus. I’m just wondering if there’s any transfer service I can take to my hostel? Or I just have to grab from the Dalat bus station? 
 Also, is it hard to get a grab at 4/5am in the morning? How safe is it? 
 Feel free to recommend some places to add to my itinerary! (:

                              <span>I live in a pretty small city in VN, Lang Son, and local jewelry shops told me they can no longer exchange money (VND to USD) due to some “new government policies”.
 Is this really the case? Maybe Anyone heard of that ?

                              <span>Fairly sure I just got scammed, just wanting to make sure and any precautions I should take- gave the guy my email.
 Guy came up to me on the street with his scooter and started talking to me, picking me as Australian. Told me he has family in Australia and telling me all about them. Asked if I&#x27;d like to get a drink with him, which I was happy to do!
 Spent some time drinking with him, during which time he told me his family were visiting and they were having a big party. When it was time to go, he asked if I&#x27;d buy a bottle of wine for their party, which I agreed to do. He took me about a 10min ride away to a shop to buy wine, which cost 900,000 dong and then took me back to where we met. I realised at the time the wine was very expensive but I was a little drunk and didn&#x27;t know where I was exactly so I didn&#x27;t protest. I assume he just takes the wine back and splits the profits with the shop! 
 While we were drinking he took my email, I assume he&#x27;ll try and have me send money for something else, but should I watch out for anything else? 
 Thanks for any advice!

                              <span>Hi there, 
 In Vietnam for 9 days and trying to get from Ha Long Bay to Hoi An. What‘s the best mode of travel? Is a sleeper bus too mad? Will the trains be too long and too much of a nightmare? We would just fly from Hanoi but it seems a shame not to see more of the country from the road / track. Or maybe that’s us being too romantic!
 Thanks!

 I’m hopping onto a sleeper bus to Sapa shortly after landing and don’t have time to venture out of the airport. 
 TIA!

                              <span>Is it true that most condos in vietnam are not properly well maintained and the building quality and condo price will decline over time ? In the US, condos built 50 years ago can be used just fine but a friend told me even 10-year old building in Vietnam shows clear sign of degradation.

I used it in Japan, it&#x27;s a device you could rent in the airport and that gives you wifi. It&#x27;s more pratical than a sim card I think, so if there is somerhing similar thanks to let me know!

My experience so far has been a) head too big/helmet too small b) helmet looks like it&#x27;ll do nothing to protect the head (probs just designed to protect the wallet from the police)
 Any suggestions on where I can go? Thanks!

 I have some experience shipping from the US to Vietnam via the places that charge based on weight about $5USD and more per pound (lb). But not sure if it works similar the opposite way? 
 Trying to see if I can get my mom some ao dai and some snacks for me 😂.

                              <span>i broke both my legs and was unable to walk. Because of this I had to have surgery and after feeling strong enough to move around in a wheelchair. I decided to go to the immigration department tomorrow to sort out my overstaying issue and hopefully also be able to extend my stay in hanoi for another 2 months. I came here as a foreigner alone for my summer vacation and I am afraid that because of this I might not be able to go back to my home country. Any advice on what should i do? I have asked around and some people say to just overstay for 2-3 months until you are fully recovered and pay a fine. while some say i should get to the immigration department as soon as possible even if it is difficult for me to move. I am really scared as I am alone and do not speak vietnamese.

 If I can visit shop first and see the product then that would be good. I need to check the size as I&#x27;m now staying in a smallish apartment which has a small kitchenette. I&#x27;m currently staying in Vung Tau. Will be visiting Ho Chi Minh City tomorrow to buy. 
 Any recommendations?

                              <span>Ive been in Vietnam for 2 weeks, got another 2 to go, got tone of matches so it was a huge confidence boost. Although, most of them doesn&#x27;t talk to me after a few messages and the one who does talk to me want to get married so naturally Id asked to meet up. Before meeting up theyd try to get me to sign up to some dodgy exchange or help them with money and when I refuse, they&#x27;d say that because I don&#x27;t trust them so no point carrying on this.

                              <span>As the title says, I was pick pocketed last night around 1am (this morning I guess if you want to get technical). This was at a bar on Saigons Bui Vien walking street. My wallet only had a few hundred thousand dong and a bank card that I canceled as soon as I noticed my wallet was gone. The bar staff told me to go to the police the following morning because they stop operating at 10pm. 
 I didn’t bother going to the police because it would be a waste of everyone’s time for such a small crime. But is this the truth? Or was the staff telling me this so that the police would not come to the bar and ruin the party?

                              <span>Xin Chao,
 Vietnam has one of the fastest-growing GDPs in the world. I&#x27;m curious why, when the GDP is adjusted for inflation, the growth of real GDP fluctuates regularly over a short period of time every year ? 
 Does anyone has a possible answer ?

                              <span>So. I need to get this off my chest, as I am worried. I went onto a pornsite(horny hours, didn’t know it was shut down), and noticed that a warning came up. Can’t read it as I am not vietnamese, but I ran the warning through google translate and noticed that it said something about this being recorded and something to do with gambling even though I have never gambled at all during my visit here. They even showed my ip and all that which is really freaking me out. Am I in trouble? Mind you I don’t gamble or anything and just stayed at a friend’s house during my time here for most of it

                              <span>Please help!
 I was traveling for 2 weeks in Vietnam and purchased a Vietnamobile SIM
 I jsut got home to Australia, put my Dodo sim in my unlocked iphone xr, and suddently get SIM UNSUPPORTED error and it is now SIM locked. To Vietnamobile
 ​
 I have spent three days on chat to apple, dodo and vietnamobile, NOBODY is accepting responsibility, each company tells me it is the others responsibility
 ​
 Has anyone had this issue when returning home and if so, how did you unlock your phone?
 I live alone and have no phone access and cannot afford another iphone :(
 ​
 This must happen all the time to tourists, surely?
 ​
 Any help is SOOOOO appreciated, I am so stressed and exhausted trying to fix this
 ​
 TO ADD: So many of you have been so helpful, thankyou
 ​
 For the one who called me a troll and a luddite and illiterate, really unkind and unecessary to attack a stranger who has spent days trying to resolve this and been told different answers by Apple, and 3 different carriers / telcos. So yes, it is frustrating and stressful, and being called an idiot and a troll online is not helpful or kind.

 my wife and I are flying to Vietnam (for the first time ever) in October and we are not certain how to distribute the days among the different travel destinations and I was hoping you could help us a bit.
 We have a total of 15 days, including arrival on 22.10.2023 in Ho Chi Minh City at 07:35am and departure from Ha Noi at 11:30pm, and we are planning to fly to Da Nang to visit this city and Hoi An before we catch our next flight to Ha Noi.
 From Ha Noi, we would like to take the 3days/2nigts cruise to Ha Long Bay (or maybe Lan Ha Bay) and spend the remaining days in Ha Noi before flying home again.
 Our current plan is as follows:
 Arrival in HMC on Sunday, 21.10.2023 at 07:35am (Vietnam Airlines, already booked)
 Arrival in Da Nang on Wednesday, 25.10.2023 at 09:40pm (Bamboo Ai…</span>

 Jazz, rock, funk, even hip hop beats (the easiest). This would be using a full pearl forum series kit.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Does anyone know any good places to buy Graphic Novels in HCMC? I’m thinking DC/Marvel type stuff.
 Alternatively does anyone know a business who imports Amazon products? 
 Thanks for the help!

                              <span>Many people suggest that when crossing the road in Vietnam, you should not stop but instead keep walking, even if there are numerous motorcycles on the street. Is this true? And is it safe to do so ?

 Can only be max 7 characters (Australian plate). Preferably nothing too naughty or vulga. 
 Some ideas we&#x27;ve got so far: - TRA SUA - HAM AN - HAM CHOI - HET TIEN - XE MUON - 3 CONMEO (we have 3 cats) - BBHUE

                              <span>So I’m planning to spend around 10 days in Da Nang in mid September and was worried about the rainy season there. How many hours does it rain there on average and are we going to be able to enjoy the city despite the rain? I would be grateful if someone could give me his advice

 so far i&#x27;ve only found a random magnet with chickens and took a pic of two stray chickens near a cafe. recommendations of what to get and where to buy them are much appreciated!

                              <span>A young man from Khanh Hoa, vietnam, scammed a group of friends, families, and investors through a false promise of a pyramid scheme. 
 This young man netted nearly $800k-1,200k in USD cash (19yt to 29ty vnd) and fled to the United States. He promised the payers that if they contribute and add money to his investment, they will gain profit and will be distributed evenly among all. This young man owns several shops and business, all of which went bankrupt. He leaves behind his wife and children behind in Vietnam.
 The authorities are not involved yet as private detectives were hired through family and friends. What are the possibilities or catching this scammer? What are your thoughts? Posting here before it makes the headlines. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, we&#x27;re traveling tomorrow to Vietnam for a wedding (my second visit, flrst time for husband), traveling south to north. I love hikes and adventure, but being pregnant am a little restricted in activities. 
 We land in hcm on 16 June and have ~5-7 days to kill before wedding festivities begin in HCM. Hoian and Hanoi (incl halong bay) are on the plan already. We&#x27;ll do at least a day trip to ninh binh as well.
 I haven&#x27;t been to phong nha, sa pa, ninh binh, phu quoc, or ha giang loop before. Which of these could we realistically fit in? Rural, picturesque and authentic experiences preferred over touristy. 
 Thanks!!

 We will have a mod discussion about the future of this subreddit and how we move forward, but many of the mods use third party apps as part of their mod work and current apps will be killed at the end of this month. Reddit is making reddit unusable and we will continue to make waves until this is fixed.

                              <span>Hello all. 
 I am unfamiliar with Vietnam laws and would like to know more if possible please.
 There is a YouTube account owned by an individual that is believed to live in Vietnam. This individual post fake animal rescue videos. If you’re unfamiliar with this, the “rescuer” puts an animal in danger,harms, or injures the animal and then proceeds to record them being rescued for views and donations. 
 Their accounts are BA Animals Care Media and BAC. Both post the same content and are owned by the same person. Please do not view their videos as it will gain popularity that way. Instead report it to YouTube. 
 My questions are, are there any animal rights in Vietnam? Does authority take animal cruelty seriously? 
 I’ve reached out to a few rescue groups in Vietnam I found on google. I’m hoping they could help. But I would be grateful for any and all insight into this. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>I contacted someone from iro tattoo team for a quote of a 13 cm tattoo on my left thigh. I asked him to change a few aspects of the image I sent which was a Chinese dragon and asked him to change the flowers to be specific plants and he gave a cost of $15-20 mil vnd and should take about 3-4 hrs. This seems extremely expensive to me or am I wrong? I don’t have any other tattoos so I have no experience and appreciate any advice or other places to go to for a tattoo.

(Contact info below) Just finished my food tour with her and she’s the sweetest kindest human and she took us to 8 different places and it was amazing. Holes in the wall you wouldn’t consider. Down alleyways up three flights of stairs to hidden spots. We have dietary restrictions (my husband doesn’t eat pork, which is tough here because 90% of food in Vietnam is based around pork and I’m mostly vegetarian) and she was able to accommodate us and still make the tour authentic and true to Hanoian culture and food. Her English was great and she was easy to talk to and get along with. She really deserves the shout out and recognition. We looked around for food tours and I saw someone mention her on here and I found her via Airbnb. But here’s her direct contact: +84 165 768 6004

                              <span>sau gần 11 năm sinh sống và gắn bó với người bạn 4 chân của mình, đến ngày hôm nay mình đã phải nói lời chia tay với bạn í, mình không biết mọi người như thế nào nhưng bạn í đến với mình trong giai đoạn mình lớn lên và trưởng thành đến năm nay mình đã là sinh viên đại học năm thứ 2 rồi, mỗi một ngày mình thức dậy đều có bạn í mình chả thể tượng tượng ra một ngày mình thức dậy mà không có bạn ấy ở bên mà nô đùa. Lúc mình lớn mình có hơi đầu đường xó chợ nma việc có bạn ấy nhắc nhớ mình rằng mình vẫn còn tình người tình thương mọi thứ, đến dạo đây bạn đã già r bạn ấy mắc thêm cả bệnh nữa mình và gia đình đã dốc hết sức để chữa bệnh trong vòng 2 tháng nay nhưng đến hiện tại bạn ấy không thể chiến đấu được nữa và bạn ấy đã ra đi trong sáng sớm ngày hôm nay, cái cảm giác đi ra ôm lấy bạn ấy người bạn ấy lạnh ngắt mình chỉ dám nhắm mắt ôm bạn ấy vào lòng r gào thôi, mình biết sinh lão bệnh tử già thì sẽ phải đi nma mình thực sự chưa sẵn sàng, mình không lên đây khóc online mình chỉ đang cố gắng giải toả ra những cơn đau này mà thôi và mình cũng đang cố gắng tìm dc cái bình yên trong những lúc này.
 bất kì bạn là ai bạn nuôi con gì hay nhớ lấy ngoài tình yêu thương của cha mẹ là vô điều kiện thì động vật những người bạn những thú cưng của chúng ta cũng sẵn sàng yêu thương mình vô điều kiện như vậy dẫu chúng không thể hiểu được không thể nói được nma mình cảm nhận là như vậy, hãy quý trọng mọi sinh mạng và hãy yêu thương lấy những người bạn đấy

                              <span>I think for the most part, people in Vietnam are quite laidback and friendly. Why does it change so much when people are driving? A large number of people just turn into selfish assholes as soon as they&#x27;re in control of a vehicle. Car drivers seem to consider the possibility of slowing down or giving way an insult to their ego. Bike drivers pay little attention to any kind of rules unless they&#x27;re being watched by police. They&#x27;ll drive the wrong way, break red lights, use sidewalks, pay zero attention to other traffic and refuse to stop at junctions. Buses and trucks only seem to have an accelerator and a horn. Everybody seems to be in a massive rush to get somewhere, yet when they arrive they just nonchalantly wander around like NPCs. 
 What&#x27;s actually going on? I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s not everyone and you see plenty of people patiently waiting in traffic while those around them mount the sidewalk, but the sheer number of people that act like assholes on the road is way higher than in other countries. I don&#x27;t think it just infrastructure because it happens even when the infrastructure is good. I also see people blame lack of education or poor people from the countryside, but you can cross the border into Laos and it&#x27;s totally different experience

 We arrived here slightly later than planned, but luckily, we caught the sunset just in time and took some beautiful photos.
 I love Cao Bang because of the friendly people, the breathtaking scenery, and the fantastic cuisine here. If I had a chance, I would return here as soon as possible.

                              <span>So I looked it up and apparently porn is illegal in Vietnam, but In seeing some mixed answers. I just got to Vietnam and opened up the hub without a VPN to see if it would be blocked or not(it wasn&#x27;t) before finding out it was illegal. Can the police just show up at my doorstep and arrest me? Haven&#x27;t distributed any porn, don&#x27;t have any DVDs or anything like that.

                              <span>Hello, I’ve recently joined Reddit and have been lurking for some information. 
 I’m a copywriter and my career background is in digital content/creative, I have a BA (Hons) from a UK university and I’m currently working as a content manager for a large financial services company in New Zealand. 
 My wife is Japanese, and we are looking at relocating to Asia, last month I applied for a job as a copywriter with an investment bank which has several offices across Asia including Ho Chi Minh. So far, I have completed one interview and submitted a written piece for examination, I am currently waiting to hear the outcome and I believe a second round of interviews after this. I have discussed this briefly over email with the company however, I’d like to see if anyone has any first-hand experience…</span>

There are barely any videos about this on youtube, despite it being super interesting and very important considering it is the origins of a certain conflict involving the u.s

                              <span>To me, the tones of Tiếng Bắc and Tiếng Nam sound the same for the most part, save for dấu hỏi and ngã. However, I noticed that the tones of Tiếng Huế sound vastly different from the first two: dấu sắc is lower rather than higher and sounds more like dấu hỏi, and dấu huyền is higher instead of slightly lower, but not as high as a typical dấu sắc. A few days ago I asked a Chinese friend what the four tones in Chinese sounded like, and I realized that they sounded very similar to Tiếng Huế’s tones. Dấu huyền of Tiếng Huế sounds like the falling tone of Chinese and dấu sắc sounds like the rising tone. I can’t speak for whether dấu hỏi/ngã sounds like the down-up tone, as I do not know what hỏi/ngã sounds like in Tiếng Huế. Why do Tiếng Huế’s tones sound similar to the Chinese tones? I’m guessing because Huế was the old capital of Việt Nam, most likely where most of the nobles/elites resided. Being a noble probably meant you probably had be able to speak in Mandarin and write in Chữ Hán/Nom, which likely had an influence on how they spoke Vietnamese. Can anyone confirm my theory?

                              <span>I found this at the Alternate History Forum website.
 https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/general-jean-de-lattre-de-tassigny-vs-general-westmoreland.182885/
 I&#x27;mt not as into Vietnam as other wars but after stumbling into that article in link above I am now inquisitive.
 People far more familiar with Vietnamese history than I am especially those who read on the French Indochina War and later the American Vietnam War, whats your take? Is General De Lattre a much better general than Westmoreland was like OP claims in the link with his gigantic paragraph of details? I&#x27;m seeking a balanced view since the poster at Alternate History Forum is obviously super biased.
 I have heard of De Lattre prior to reading the article as one of the most famous French generals of the Second World. I also have seen documentaries that stated Westmoreland was an artillery officer during the War too. So they were obviously both contemporaries. But I didn&#x27;t know much more than that prior to reading the article.

 Do you have experienced driving a motorcycle through Vietnam? How safe/dangerous is it?
 Thanks!

                              <span>There, I finally said it. The amount of foreigners that recommends and praises this chain is unbelievable. 
 You can get basically anything they sell for much cheaper in tons of other places (even online with delivery within 2 hours).
 Don&#x27;t shop like a tourist... You guys are the reason their prices remain so unrealistic, you&#x27;re letting them scam you with every purchase.
 Edit: I&#x27;m so happy to see everyone agrees! Much smarter people here than in that foodies group 😂

                              <span>I fell in love with so many local brands in Vietnam. Blanke Space, Levents, The Bad God, Why Not Studios, Lider, Missout, Bad Rabbit, Bad Habit and Trisch. I loved shopping at the New Playground to discover more brands. 
 It inspires me to finally start my own brand but in Vietnam instead. The market seems to be stronger for local brands. Google isn’t the most helpful as it seems to push Vietnamese manufacturers to sell in North America. Does anyone have any contacts or an idea on where I can start to find manufacturers or designers?

                              <span>I’m really starting to reconsider moving to Hanoi. I have a job lined up there with a fairly decent school but with all the news lately of the Pollution issues and the biggest one being the rolling blackouts, I am not so sure it’s a good idea now. I’m very worried about whether it’s worth leaving Tokyo japan for Hanoi now.
 Anyone have any input?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a list of every country&#x27;s most iconic cult film (list here: https://boxd.it/n5ZFs) and wondered if anyone could help me figure out Vietnam&#x27;s entry. I&#x27;m looking for a film that might not be well-known outside the country&#x27;s borders. Perhaps it&#x27;s a film everyone knows, and is hugely popular only to Vietnamese audiences, even if it wasn&#x27;t popular with critics. Or maybe it&#x27;s a film that wasn&#x27;t well-received by audiences or critics, but has gained a cult following in the years since its release. Any suggestions would be most welcome!

As research Stripe and Braintree don&#x27;t seem to support Vietnamese. I found that services like 2Checkout, PayU and Bluesnap work and just want to know from your experience which one should I go for?

They told us to call the bank as if a bank teller is gonna know what the hell we’re talking about. I’m wondering if any of you could point me in the right direction. Thank you.

I&#x27;m being told by the hotel that there are scheduled powercuts in the area ( they are implying it is done area wise ) and are offering me an alternate stay in another hotel. Am I being scammed due to overbooking? Are there such power cuts ( Daly long types ) going on in Hanoi currently?

                              <span>The news that Vietnam will have 70 Michelin Guide honored restaurants in 2023 is encouraging and long overdue. Vietnam&#x27;s unique culinary traditions, blending multiple regional styles with influences from China and France, produce some of the world&#x27;s most iconic and delicious dishes.
 From pho to banh mi, spring rolls to imperial court cuisine, Vietnamese food withstands comparison with the finest culinary traditions anywhere. The creativity, skill and passion of Vietnamese chefs across the country have produced cooking that has long deserved global renown.
 Having 70 Michelin-reviewed establishments will help showcase the diversity and quality of Vietnam&#x27;s dynamic restaurant scene to an international audience. It will attract more food tourists, boosting the hospitality industry and local economies. Most importantly, it provides deserved recognition for the craftsmanship and dedicated hard work of Vietnamese chefs over generations.
 As a Vietnamese, I have long taken for granted the pleasures of Vietnam&#x27;s cuisine. But global acknowledgement from prestigious groups like Michelin will be a source of pride for Vietnamese people everywhere. It demonstrates that our culture&#x27;s softest power - our food - can compete on the world stage. I hope this is just the beginning and that more Vietnamese culinary masters will have their talents spotlighted in the years to come.
 Vietnamese restaurants have earned their place amongst the finest in the world. I hope the Michelin Guide and other international reviewers will help spread the word and introduce more people to the joys of Vietnamese gastronomy. Our chefs deserve this honor - now it&#x27;s time for the world to feast their eyes and taste buds on what Vietnam has to offer.

                              <span>I have planned a trip to Vietnam. However I want to buy latex clothes in Bangkok. I heard it is illegal and customs may confiscate it. Can there be other problems with the law besides confiscation? Im very afraid that they may confiscate and problems with law.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in and out of Vietnam quite a bit over the past year for work. I&#x27;ve been using Zalo to communicate to my driver and team members when I&#x27;m back at my apartment / out of the office (I don&#x27;t have Facebook, so this was a good alternative while out here).
 Unfortunately, I had to replace my phone last time and Zalo put me through some loops to basically &quot;re authenticate&quot; me by having someone already in my Zalo contacts confirm it&#x27;s me. Naturally, that happened a few days before I flew back out here, so I was unable to get in touch with anyone when I landed (didn&#x27;t realize this was needed until I landed). I eventually got hold of someone and they did the in-person verification.
 However, ever since then, the Zalo app keeps telling me I need to &quot;verify&quot; my account. It has an option to upload a photo of your passport but it doesn&#x27;t seem to like an American passport. Do I need to verify? How do I do this? Anyone have experience making it work?
 I tried to chat with Zalo support but they only would message me in Vietnamese. I really only use this to keep in touch with my team, does verify even matter?

                              <span>My passport expires June 5th, 2024 - I am traveling to Vietnam November 10th-25th 2023. That leaves me with with 6 month 10 days roughly when I leave the country. Do you think this will be fine? I am worried it is cutting it too close. 
 I am planning another out of country trip to Mexico in a few months as well and need my passport - in order to renew by mail you must send in your passport and I am worried it won&#x27;t get back in time for my trip to Mexico. I don&#x27;t want to send it after MX because there are so many delays with passports right now due to covid. Will it be fine?

                              <span>Our last day in Vietnam tomorrow. We&#x27;ve been roaming Hanoi in search of vegetarian food. I thought I would list some to help others. If you have any other quality recos, please add. We will try them and report back if we can.
 Quán Phở Chay anh Hải. Hole in the wall breakfast pho place. Super. 
 Bun Cha Ta Hanoi. Fried spring roll bun (#6) is yum. Sit upstairs with shoes off. Fun.
 Katze Vegan &amp; Vegetarian. What a cool story and hard working dude. Pricier food, but quality is top. And variety is great. Banana blossom salad, yes please.
 Bánh mì chay Vegan. Cool faux meat options. Really good.
 Banhmi LongHoi. Chay version is yum. Sit all the way up top and people watch.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am flying to Vietnam and I have a layover in Doha (Qatar). 
 The layover is 10 hours so i will stay in transit and hopefully not have to go through customs. 
 Will I be okay traveling with my prescribed (in usa) medication for Vyvanse for 25 days? Ofc i keep it in the original bottle.

                              <span>I’m a viet kieu but grew up in the US so I’m definitely more American than Vietnamese. Anyways, I married a Vietnamese woman and we have a 3 year old son together. We just started preschool for him in a pretty decent school, paying 7 million VND/month, but my wife insists we should also “tip” our son’s teachers so they will give him preferential treatment. Is this normal? What happens if I don’t? What happens if everyone does? Then what is “preferential treatment” mean?

 Phan Thi Kim Puc the girl in this photograph was 8 years old living in a small village in 1972 when it was shot. Doctors did not really give a chance to her looking at the severe burns on her body. However extensive surgery helped her to come through the ordeal. She later did her medicine in Cuba , where she met her future husband Bui Huy Toan. The couple later migrated to Canada , where they settled near Toronto. In 1997 she set up the Kim Phuc Foundation to help child victims of war. Truly remarkable lady.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am considering doing the ha giang loop on the back of an easy rider on my upcoming trip. Two main concerns I have are:
  
Is the weather in the region suitable for the tour during August?
 
I asked the tour guide people if a 130kg (im a big guy) person would be suitable to ride on these bikes with an easy rider, and they said “130 should be fine”
 
 Should?!
 I fully understand if I’m not able to go but that kind of animosity scares me haha. Should I ask again? is it too risky? 
 I would appreciate responses, thank you!!

Hostels look pretty good from what I&#x27;ve seen.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve lived in Vietnam for a while and a pescatsrian friend is coming over for the first time. I want to show her some of my favourites like bun cha, bun bo, pho, bo kho, etc. - but obviously she can&#x27;t eat them due to her diet.
 Is there anywhere that does vegetarian twists on these Vietnamese classics?
 Aslo open to suggestions for good veggie friendly restaurants or dishes that can be found anywhere.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>This is mostly aimed at people living in Hanoi and the surrounding provinces. 
 As some of you may know, there is a power shortage that will continue throughout June. The official word is that power cuts will be occuring daily due to &quot;El Nino&quot;. 
 Over the past week or so, my district (Long Bien) has experienced 5 outages that last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours at a time. We&#x27;re told about them in the morning, so there isn&#x27;t much time to plan around them as they start at 8 AM. 
 Tonight, we&#x27;ve been told (officially) that the outages will occur each day for the next month. In my 9 years living in Hanoi, I&#x27;ve never experienced this before, yes, occasionally power will cut during a typhoon, but never like this. 
 Does anyone else who is currently going through this have a backup generator? Is it worth investing in one? My wife and I run our business from home and we need to be online 24/7. We can&#x27;t be out of the house for too long as we have 2 dogs that only pee outside and our son comes home for lunch and a nap each day. 
 Need advice on how to deal with it. Can&#x27;t move because we own our property. Should I buy a generator? Have you heard any information about the power cuts that might shed more light than our building&#x27;s manager has already? Do you know someone who works in the energy sector that has mentioned it to you? Feeling absolutely helpess RN.

                              <span>I saw an estimate of the percentage of Catholics in Vietnam and, it says it&#x27;s about 7%. Is it right? But talking about some beliefs, they say that Our Lady made an apparition in La Vang 17/August/1798, what I particularly believe, as a Catholic. I&#x27;m not here to discuss religion itself, but I&#x27;d like to know your thoughts on that and, if someone has a picture/statue/icon, a photo of it (please 😀)

 Was looking to get some good hostel recommendations in each of these cities. Chill or Party vibes will be preferred, if there&#x27;s anything like that xD

 I&#x27;ll be going to places where there will be a good amount of mosquitos soon I believe (Nin Binh, Cat Ba island, Phong Nha,)
 Do you guys suggest DEET for non clothed skin ((eg; face, hands, etc) and Pemethrin to put on top of clothing (shirt, pants , etc)? If so, what barands also sell Pemethrin ?

                              <span>Hi All, we are a mixed couple and just found out we are moving to HCMC. We are into nightlife, we party, close daytime social areas to meet people, make new friends, hit the gym, convenient parks to walk the dogs, prefer near waterfront with a water view, good mix of Việt and foreigners. Where do we look to live? We currently live in Hanoi on the lake, next to a park, lots of people gather and meet. We would love something similar. Places we have seen on listing that intrique us: Icon 56 building D2 Sanwah Pearl Golden River looks nice but no dogs. Suggestions welcome
 We want a mix of social, access to everything we want to buy, not overpriced but we aren&#x27;t cheap, unique, where we can easily meet like singles and couples.

                              <span>When in the country I can top up my account at 7/11 but once I leave I only have the app. It seems it only allows VN-local payments assuming a VN bank account to top up that way and keep the SIM from expiring. Is that right or am I missing something? Could a friend locally get a ‘top up’ receipt for my number that I could punch in with the SIM in my phone while being abroad?

Nghe nói bệnh viện từ dũ rất tốt, nhưng k biết là mình tin được cái hype đó không? Is it just hype? Or actually good? Có khi nào nó nổi tiếng to the point it will be too crowded and we won’t have a room when we show up? Any better alternatives? Thanks guys

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I was wondering if anyone would be able to share any resources or guides for medical terminology in Vietnamese? I was working at a clinic and got lost with the word &quot;glaucoma.&quot; Alternatively, I would to practice my Vietnamese with a partner if anyone is interested! I grew up speaking some Vietnamese but am really hoping to become more fluent. 
 Thank you!

 I&#x27;m trying to look for a tattoo shop that offers somewhat reasonably priced services. I&#x27;ve been offered around 200 USD for 12*9cm minimalist designs. 
 Do you guys have any other shops to recommend?

                              <span>I recently got my visa approved for Vietnam and when I applied I listed Ho Chi Minh City as where I will be departing from because my very loose plan is to start in Hanoi and make my way down south before going to Cambodia. However, there is a chance I will stay in the north and then go to Laos and Thailand. So, right now all I have is my one way plane ticket to Hanoi. Do I need to show proof of a departing flight when arriving in Vietnam? The last time I was in Vietnam I did have a departing flight but I don&#x27;t remember what the protocol was/if they checked it. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be doing a 3-week travel to Vietnam from south to north. 
 Major locations: HCMC, Mékong Delta, Hoi An, Ninh Binh, Ha Long Bay, Ba Be park, Bao Lac, Meo Vac, Quan Ba, others in the north, Hanoi.
 I am not sure whether to take malaria tablets. I am rather risk averse when it comes to health. Could you please advise on this? 
 Thanks!

 Any hidden gems or places to go to? Even if its a closeby province it should be alright

I have a friend that met me in Vietnam to do a bike trip from Hanoi to Saigon within 3 weeks and was wondering if there are places that we would be able to go to in Vietnam that have games like NHL or smite to play. Thanks in advance for any information.

                              <span>I was out in the beer streets of Hanoi and literally ran into 5-6 “sexpats” in just a few hours, just openly hanging out with ladies of the night on the streets. They were all talking about how they rent apartments here for peanuts, and simply eat Bahn Mis and plow fresh young Vietnamese chicks on the daily.
 One guy buys like 100 pills of viagra and uses them all in under two months. He’s a lawyer and just has a broker who sends him up fresh meat multiple times a day.
 To be honest, it was kind of repulsive to hear about all this. I’ve been having a great time with the locals and it’s kind of nuts how all these women are getting used and abused by westerners. What do local Vietnamese think about this? They seem to be happy with throwing their daughters to the viagra popping wolves of the west.

 My ELO on chess.com is around 1600 rapid, but currently feeling like 1000 because of jet-lag.

                              <span>Family of 4 just finished an amazing trip in Hanoi. For context : African-American, M (52yo), F(52), twins M(18) and F(18). We were stopped on numerous occasions and asked to take pictures - in Hanoi, in the terminal and on the ferry from Halong Bay, in particular. There was a language barrier so I wasn’t able to ascertain from the requesters as to why. When I asked those who did speak English, no one had an explanation. Can you help me?

                              <span>Bối cảnh rằng tôi là nhân viên mặt đất của một hãng hàng không trong nước V… khoảng 4 năm cho đến giờ. Tôi cũng đã có một mối tình 7 năm với vợ mình từ những năm đầu khi còn học đại học, chúng tôi cưới nhau 2 năm rưỡi từ trước dịch covid19, và chưa có con.
 Mọi thứ cứ trôi qua êm đẹp như vậy, đi làm kiếm tiền như bao người. Cho đến khi vợ tôi nghỉ công tác tại ngân hàng M… Việc này làm tôi khá khủng hoảng về tinh thần khi làm ca kíp về và liên tục bị trì triết, phàn nàn về nhiều thứ. Và vợ tự sinh ra cái suy nghĩ nghỉ làm thành gánh nặng của tôi, mặc dù tôi cũng rất tán thành việc nghỉ nếu công việc quá áp lực và không hiệu quả về kinh tế. 
 Tôi chả biết do nghiệp hay duyên làm tôi có quen được 1 chị tiếp viên hơn tôi 3 tuổi vào đúng thời gian này. Không ai chủ động, chỉ nói chuyện về công việc rồi chia sẻ về cuộc sống, dần rà sau 1 tháng điều gì đến sẽ đến. Vâng, tôi có cãi nhau với vợ và rủ chị kia đi Hạ Long chơi và có qhtd. Ban đầu mục đích của tôi chỉ là giải toả căng thẳng, bằng một cách thần cmn kỳ xong chị ta yêu tôi. Rồi ngày qua ngày, việc chị ta cứ chia sẻ công việc (cùng ngành) mua đồ, quan tâm đến tôi cũng làm tôi có chút rung động :)
 Thực sự việc này tôi đã biết là sai ngay từ lúc rủ chị ta đi Hạ Long, tôi cũng vẫn rất yêu vợ mình chứ. Nhưng bản tính tham lam và râm tục của tôi làm tôi vẫn muốn giữ mối quan hệ này :( Chị ta cũng biết tôi có vợ và vẫn chấp nhận làm người thứ 3… Sau khi chia sẻ những lời này thì tôi vẫn đang có một gia đình đáng yêu và vẫn duy trì mqh ngoài luồng. Tôi sai rồi!!

                              <span>My parents and the older generation of my family, those who immigrated to the US, have always said that American and Western foods are always too salty or too sweet. They always say that too much salt or sugar is used. They also say this is why American food is so unhealthy.
 I’ve mainly been raised up in the US and eat both Asian and Western cuisines but never found this to be true. I’ve always found most foods to be reasonably seasoned to my tastes. I’ve asked friends and family around my age, and they also generally agree with me. I also believe the whole “American food is unhealthy” myth to be untrue because that really only applies to fast food which you really don’t eat on a daily basis. It’s also a huge over generalization of American cuisine considering how diverse each region and state is. I digress though. Is it really true that Vietnamese/Asian cuisine use less salt/sugar and are healthier than American/Western cuisine, or is this more of a subjective to taste thing?

                              <span>I’m returning to Vietnam from Australia next week! Last year I spent a month travelling your beautiful country, but this time I’m spending 2 weeks in Saigon. 
 I’m looking to see if there is any sort of Hip Hop scene in Saigon? Have it be gigs, shops, painters, dancers, rappers and singer, anything really. I’m a street artist here in Australia and found a bit of a scene last year in Hanoi, so surely there is something going in in Saigon. 
 Also, looking to go and see some good live music, both traditional and if there is any contemporary gigs. I’ve found the opera which will be great to go to. But I’m open to anything really! Also if there is any race scene at all? I’ve found a few clubs that have potential like Arcan. 
 Thanks in advanced everyone. I’m so excited to be back in Vietnam next week!!!

 Anime would be great.

                              <span>A few days ago I went to a massage parlor (which clearly advertises happy endings) and the staff was extremely friendly, like they knew how to talk to foreigners and banter with them.
 I actually got along really well with my girl, and we talked quite a bit (a lot of it using google translate). After everything was said and done, I was gathering my belongings, I asked her what she recommended I do for fun in Hanoi. On google translate she said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I only stay here&quot; and she had kind of a weird look on her face.
 It was kind of strange, like she just looked at me for a moment, the continued dressing me. 
 What do you think that meant?

 ​
 I would like to know the general opinion on VinU and whether I should consider it.

                              <span>Hi all! I am an Indian trying to move to Vietnam for work. I got an offer at a Vietnamese company and plan on moving in July 2023 for long stay. How difficult is the visa process? Are their any contractual restrictions? How do the work laws function in Vietnam for foreigners? 
 Thanks in advance!

 I was already in a bad mood so I told him to cancel my room and booked next door. 
 Is it still legal tender or is it basically redundant now? 
 Can I change it at a bank (I’m a tourist and don’t have an account)?

                              <span>Hi everyone! :) Basically, I&#x27;m creating this ARG (alternate reality game) and in it, I&#x27;m trying to create this Vietnamese person who is essentially the main character. Mainly I need help with the name. I&#x27;m trying to come up with a name that would utilize the Vietnamese word for descent; the name would be made by splitting up the word into syllables that could then be used to create a full name (ex: like the word danger being used to create the name daniel criminger). Unfortunately, I do not know a lick of Vietnamese. 
 I&#x27;m struggling with two things: 
 A) I&#x27;d like to be able to find a correct translation of the Vietnamese word for descent. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of websites including Google Translate and ChatGPT and they all come up with different answers and 
 B) I&#x27;d like to be able to come up with a realistic name, something that actually sounds believable, if that makes sense. I&#x27;m sorry if it&#x27;s a large request but any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

                              <span>Xin chào, mình là sinh viên năm nhất và đang tham gia vào 1 tổ chức bên ngoài trường Đh. Lúc mới vào năm nhất kiểu bị cú sốc đầu đời á mng, ai ai cũng apply vô clb này clb nọ, các clb thì quảng bá lợi ích đẹp cv các thứ, thế là mình cũng apply vô. Thế nhưng dạo gần đây mình lại thấy khá chênh vênh, mình đang không thực sự hiểu mình đang làm gì. Những thứ mình hiện đang làm có thực sự nâng cấp bản thân của mình ? Những mối quan hệ vô trong tổ chức này mình quen có thực sự đáng giá ? Nếu mình không tham gia thì liệu mình có tốt hơn ? Mình không biết. Mình hiện tại cứ có suy nghĩ rằng ráng tham gia hết năm 2 đi, cho có cái để trải nghiệm, cho có cái để viết vào cv, nhưng mình cũng nghĩ là liệu nhà tuyển dụng có thật sự quan tâm ? Mình không biết nên out hay ở ... Hãy cho mình xin lời khuyên.

                              <span>Hello, I’ll be visiting Vietnam in august, I am very stuck, we have 14 nights. So far we are planning to do Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. We are planning to visit danang in between and also ha long bay. Mainly as day trips because of affordability. 
 Now, I’m trying to book hotels, and I want a very nice 4 or 5 star hotel in a modern area of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. 
 I’m looking for hotels similar to jw Marriott (Hanoi), they’re fully booked for my dates so any similar will do. And if anyone can recommend me anything for Ho Chi Minh I’d be grateful! 
 Thank you

 My wife’s bà nội died suddenly, we won’t be able to make it to Vietnam in time for the funeral. 
 She’s already burned some incense at our tiny shrine. But she’s not practising and does this stuff more out of habit than anything else.
 What could I do on the day of the funeral to mark my respect? I was thinking to print a picture of her and get a small bouquet of white lilies and putting them on the shrine. Is that appropriate?

 there is a big vietnamese shopping center in berlin germany. A few years ago i got myself a vietnamese pastry after a vietnamese frien recommended it.
 it was sweet and i guessed made with rice flour so kinda like mochi but really big, hand sized. it was wrapped in a bananaleaf, went there twice after that encounter got somethings i thought that were like that but it was both times bitter and not what i wanted. Can anyone plese tell me the name?

                              <span>Hey All. I am very new to this sub because I am considering taking a job in Vietnam with my almost 3 year old son. The job will pay for his schooling/childcare. I have a master&#x27;s in teaching English, and am looking to work in another country already. 
 A few thoughts I have are the quality of childcare, the quality of life, and what are your opinions in regards to the activites/culture in general. With so much respect to Vitetnam, I ask this with cost/life analysis perspective in mind-- how are things there? 
 *I am American by the way :)

                              <span>We are travelling for a while and have a bunch of cold weather clothes we don&#x27;t need anymore. Want to post them back to the UK - what service would you recommend? Is the Vietnam Postal Service good and if we went in, would they be able to speak any English? 
 We don&#x27;t need them to get there quickly, cost and reliability is more important than speed. 
 We are in Hanoi Old Quarter.

                              <span>Hi,
 Me and my boyfriend are looking to go to Vietnam for 2 weeks this year from the UK last week in October &amp; first week in November.
 Is it better for us to go to North or South Vietnam? We usually walk a lot on holidays and we’d ideally like good weather, but not sure where would be best to go

I’ve found a few shops but they all seem to sell new acoustic stock. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Context: first gen 22F viet-American. 
 EDIT: Some people are asking how this relates to r/vietnam, I just wanted some more Việt Kiều/mainlander perspectives to see if there’s something I’m missing in navigating this mess. 
 We had seen the first one together and they enjoyed it, so I thought they might like this. But they clearly didn’t, and even talked badly about it during the movie. EDIT: It was too artsy and chaotic for them. Too much going on.
 It’s okay if they didn’t like it since we are worlds apart when it comes to media consumption. I just hate that they didn’t at least stay and experience the movie with me and my brother. It had been a while since we had gone out to the movie theaters as a family.
 To make it worse, my brother is very hot tempered and told them to shut up several times while they were critiquing the movie, and even as they were walking out. I get where his frustration is coming from, but I don’t agree with how disrespectful he was. 
 They waited for us outside in the car. On the ride home, I tried to keep the conversation light even if I was slightly annoyed. 
 But the tension was clear. And when they confronted my brother about snapping at them, they all started yelling at each other. 
 We just got home and there was a lot of door slamming. I feel really sad. If I had known the evening would end this way, I would have just gone to see the movie myself.

                              <span>Hello! 👋 My boyfriend and I are working on applying to jobs in Vietnam, starting this week. Before we do this, we are sorting out our CVs and cover letters.
 I am a qualified English teacher with a 4-year Education degree specializing in English language. I have 6 years of experience in the industry.
 My boyfriend is a graphic designer and photographer and holds a 3-year bachelor degree in the above field, he has a 180-hour TEFL course certification and has 7 years experience. 
 He is designing our CVs from scratch, to suit our specific aesthetic wants. I have some questions regarding what Vietnamese schools might look for in a CV/what is considered professional:
 • He is holding a chihuahua in his head shot, it is a professional and very striking photo. Would this be considered strange to a Vietnamese recruiter?
 • My CV is working with a colour palette of pink and grey, are there better colours I could choose that recruiters might find more appealing or make my CV stand out more?
 • What are some specific categories in CVs that recruiters look at?
 • Is there any way we can strengthen our chances/make our CVs stand out from the rest?
 Thank you so much, this subreddit is a godsend.

 Sex outside marriage with a local is illegal in Vietnam. How is the law enforced? If you live in an upscale apartment with security and bring a guest. . . they try to stop you? Notify the police? Blackmail you with the entrance camara footage????
 Porn is illegal in Vietnam. How do they even enforce that? Customs confiscates your devices for a thorough inspection? The government tracks your internet activity?

                              <span>Hello, we live in US and want to get married in Vietnam(I am originally from Vietnam). We are in process of finalizing our wedding location. Assuming guests can make it, what is recommended location for December wedding? 
  
Cost: Will the wedding cost similar at both locations? Assuming similar type of venue and decoration. 
 
Weather: preferably we want outdoor wedding. From our initial search, it may rain in DaNang in December? 
 
Venue availability in December: DaNang seem to be busy with tourists during December 
 
 Main reason for considering DaNang/ Hoi An is half of the guests are non Vietnamese and these locations are unique to Vietnam. Since they are traveling to Vietnam, and may not travel again in future DaNang/ Hoi An has more cultural and tourist things todo. We might be wrong, but we don’t see something similar in or nearby Ho Chi Minh City. We would like your opinion/ suggestions.

                              <span>i’m preparing to travel back to vietnam for the first time soon. i was born there but moved to canada as a child, and then paris, so i’ve been surrounded by french culture almost more than my own. now that i finally got the chance to come back to vietnam, i’ve grown curious to know if there are any remnants of french culture there from colonial times. besides the obvious ones like banh mi, coffee, pho, and architecture, are there any french influences present in everyday life in VN? and what do modern viet people think of french culture, if at all?

 I plan to move to Vietnam in october and I&#x27;m having trouble to find out if my medicine exists in Vietnam. I need to take these four meds:
 Olanzapine
 Venlafaxine
 Wellbutrin (bupropion)
 Zargus (Risperidon)
 Does anyone here knows if they exist / how to buy them in Vietnam? And anyone else with borderline personality disorder would like to share their experience about moving to Vietnam?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi guys, I am planning to do the Ha Giang loop in the first week of september. How is the situation there regarding tourists? Is it crowded during this month and will i get a place to sleep when im riding on my own without a tourguide? If the streets and view spots are too crowded i would reconsider taking the trip.. Any advice would really be appreciated :)

                              <span>Hey guys, I know its not morning but the title was right there and I had to do it 😂
 I&#x27;m travelling through vietnam right now and I was looking for advice from some viet natives. I am solo travelling and just can&#x27;t seem to meet people and have remotely lengthy conversations. I keep trying but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. I&#x27;m currently in hanoi (old quarter). I&#x27;ve been walking around all day, searching online and trying to find events or language exchange communities. Looking online everyone seems to be saying its super easy to meet people here so I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m struggling. I am usually very confident talking to people back home, but it seems this language barrier is impeding me more than others.
 Any advice would be much appreciated as I&#x27;m a very social person and tend to be far happier when with people.

                              <span>Hi folks! Anyone here got good experience with therapy in Vietnam? I&#x27;m looking for recommendations of someone who&#x27;s preferably speak English and psychoanalytically trained. 
 Also is 1M the usual fee in Vietnam per session? Would therapists ever offer, idk, like a combo price or something? It just doesn&#x27;t seem very proportionate to the average wage here. 
 Thanks in advance!

 These days i really miss banh mi sandwich but there are no places to have original, legit, authentic banh mi. So I ordered this ham to make it at home. What’s the difference? Gio lua and cha chien
 Q.2 
 I prepared 
 Baguette 
 Cucumber Cilantro Pickled Carrot/radish
 Vietnamese Ham 
 Cholimex hot sauce / mayo/ butter 
 Can you recommend me some ingredients to make better banh mi? Is this basic ingredient rigth? 
 What is the genuine banh mi recipe? I googled it and searched it on YouTubed but it seems complicated than original one 🤔

                              <span>Hello.
 I am looking for a way to travel from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi by bus.
 I searched for buses on google through baolau, vexere, and sinhtourist, but none of them go directly from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi.
 The only way I can find is to get off in Da Nang or Hue and then book a new ticket.
 I&#x27;ve seen information that Mailinh Express runs this route, but when I look it up on their website, it says there are no buses.
 Can someone tell me how to get from Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi directly without any transfers?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Flying into Hanoi, then doing Halong Bay, then spending time in Hue. Looking at the weather it says thunderstorms everyday throughout every place we are going, how much of the day will be raining? Are they passing showers or all day affairs? Rain doesn’t bother me.. just curious. Any recommendations for things to do in Hanoi or Hue?

                              <span>Hello guys , I’m 21 i’m a vietnamese/black American, i been to vietnam twice when i was younger , and recently about 2 months ago. I loved the trip made me very close with the culture , i received so much love in Vietnam , why i make this post is because i want to actually move there but not sure what to expect , Im not very fluent in vietnamese but i do have knowledge and can hold a conversation in some ways , Im currently studying more with my uncles that speak vietnamese and english as they are teaching me more etc. What would you guys say i should expect committing to living in Vietnam (Mostly South VN). What is the price to live , obtain citizenship , or even a 5 year visa? I do have a small support system due to my mom growing up in a village , friends .
 1- What should I expect? 
 2-How hard it is to find a job if i’m not very fluent , i know the basics (numbers , food , little bit conversation)
 3-How will citizenship work for me if i want to obtain ? Both my parents are from VN my father doesn’t have his citizenship paper , but mother does. 
 4-How much is rent in certain district ?
 5-What is a good amount of USD to start a life in vietnam?
 6- I plan on moving there in 2025
 7- What areas would a foreigner like myself with my background should be a good start?

                              <span>Hi all!
 Currently in HCMC City. I was wondering if there are low alcohol beers (2-4%) here, besides Heineken Silver?
 Thanks for your suggestions!

                              <span>Just to make things clear I have nothing against gyms frequented by locals. I am currently attending one but because I can’t speak Vietnamese I feel like I’m slowing everyone else down and they have to put a lot of effort into accommodating me. It’s made things a little difficult.
 If anyone knows of any gyms where expats go or are used to training expats that would be great.
 Im also open to regular boxing. So if anyone knows any good expat gyms that do that too, I&#x27;d love to hear it

                              <span>I&#x27;m on contract for 2 more months in my apartment. I pay 13 mil a month. They&#x27;re making 3 more rooms on this floor right next to my room so the noise is CONSTANT and LOUD. I cannot sleep. It&#x27;s every morning and weekend.
  Also, my roof has been leaking. I have a bucket to collect most of the water, but I need to empty it and mop the floor every time it rains. I&#x27;ve been asking them to fix it for a month or reduce my rent but now I just want to leave. 
 I pay too much for this to be my reality. I only moved here because it was pet friendly, but my cat died 2 months ago. I&#x27;m off work for one month and would like to move while I have time, but they will not break my contact without keeping my security deposit, even if I feel the spirit of my contract is broken. How do I break the lease and get my money back so I can move? Am I shit out of luck? Cheers thanks.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;ve heard that the installlation fee, maintenance fee, operation fee of having Air Conditioners (AC) in some western countries costs an arm and leg. And people in some countries in Europe don&#x27;t have AC at home, according to some of my friends in France, Spain and UK.
 Sales of portable air-conditioning units rose 2,420 percent in a week, British retailer Sainsbury’s said during the hot season last year. Some in Europe are coming to accept that some AC usage may be needed to save lives. After a heat wave killed an estimated 15,000 people in France in 2003, air conditioning was introduced to some nursing homes in a bid to protect the most vulnerable. 
 How do you guys feel about AC in Vietnam, where the prices are cheap and almost every household in urban cities like Hanoi or Saigon has at least one. AC in hot nation like Vietnam is true love or a threat to the environment?

                              <span>My Vietnamese passport expired a few years ago and I want to renew it. I looked it up on the NY consulate website and it looks like for expired passport renewal you basically have to apply for a new one. But the forms for that asks a lot about pre-immigration life such as where I lived, why I left, any and all relative information including their addresses, etc. And I don’t have all this information since I moved here when I was super young and I don’t know all my relatives especially their Vietnamese names and addresses. More importantly the forms are all in Vietnamese so I’m assuming I’d have to answer in Vietnamese but I don’t speak/read/write Vietnamese. I’ve tried calling the NY consulate but haven’t gotten through to them. Looking for any advice to make this process easier

                              <span>I am vietnamese but have been in the states for 15 years. I havent been back. I am travelling to HCM and Hanoi with my partner in couple of weeks. We are comfortable with ourselves in term of PDA in cities in the states, but I am afraid we would be stared and verbally attacked. I do speak the language so the shaming may scare me. 
 My partner is from Hungary and we received that treatment when we visited the country. I do want to show him the beauty and food culture in Vietnam, yet not wanting to run into any trouble just because we are both men.

                              <span>Hi. Saturday morning we arrive in Hanoi airport. We need to transfer to our hotel in Tam Coc. Hotel has quoted us a private SUV at a cost of 1.500k. Is that reasonable? The other thing I was wondering was whether I could just book a grab from the airport to our hotel in Tam Coc or is that going to be a trip most won&#x27;t take?
 ​
 Thanks.

I assume the more reputable/expensive it is like 5 star buffets, the more safe it is. But I&#x27;m daring to try &#x27;cheaper&#x27; buffets, althought it might not be wise?

 So..is this really convincing fake meat or something more like vegetarian-fed pork? 
 Google translate didn’t clear things up much 😅

                              <span>I mean this respectfully but I am curious. Having spent a month in North Vietnam we saw a large number of villagers and tribespeople burning all their waste, filling the air with noxious plastic fumes. Is there no waste collection service in these areas? It was so sad to see the beautiful landscape blurred by the fumes of burning waste. Why does this happen?

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m currently looking for a teaching job in Vietnam, i sent my application to some centers though while waiting i wanted to try applying for jobs on Facebook groups yet i felt like it could be risky. 
 Most offers there are &quot;some locals&quot; looking for teachers and not actual schools/centers, it seemed not legit to me but what i know is that everything works differently in Vietnam, right? 
 My question is, how legit are those offers? Is there anyone here that was hired this way through a local on facebook? 
 I would appreciate your help.

The train officer (man with hat and blue uniform) came to my cabin (I am with a friend in the first class 4 berth cabin) and showed me a translation on his phone saying there will be people coming to our cabin next stop, and he can transfer them to another cabin so we can stay alone if I pay him 450,000 Dong. I payed him. Scam or real?

 In most of the south east Asian countries, Honda is usually more popular than Mazda. But here in Vietnam, seemingly Honda is not so popular. Does anyone know the reason?

                              <span>I(living in Japan) am planning to visit the home of my Vietnamese friend. I would like to bring souvenirs for their children, and I&#x27;m wondering what items would make them happy. The children are a high school girl, an 8-year-old boy, and a 5-year-old boy. There is no budget limitation.
 I guess some fancy fountain pens could be good. Any suggestions? Thank you.

                              <span>How much is the daily cost of living of an average single person living in the city side of Vietnam?
 Additional info:
 I do not intend to live yet to any country But I&#x27;m interested in GENERAL on how people live their lives as average people
 So a diverse answer is okay. Whenever you live in any city
 You can also give your personal range of cost of living as a person living by himself/herself
 I want to know or to be as grounded as possible on how natives live their life every day

 It’ll be one (25g) package only, amongst other personal stuff. It’ll be sent with dhl. It’ll be tobacco, not cigars or cigarettes.
 I read it’s allowed to import up to 250g but, it doesn’t say if that is allowed as well as a postal item. Experiences please?

 One of them is her views on spanking children.
 Do most Vietnamese mothers spank?
 Growing up in the United States, it was one of those things that was usually considered private and only discussed with close friends so I honestly cannot even give an answer for how common it is in The United States (perhaps she will have a similar honest answer).
 In the United States, I would say that it about half and half (but that is only from my experience).

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m planning a journey for myself and husband. We&#x27;re first-time travellers to Vietnam this year in late August / early September. Any tips for off the beaten track tours of 1 or 2 days on the Mekong Delta? We&#x27;re used to road-trips and bumping into authentic experiences with people, a local guide in this case will probably give us insights we wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have. I found something by Innoviet and Local-insider, but I still don&#x27;t know if that is what we&#x27;re looking for. Any tips will be much appreciated.

                              <span>I always find it strange that Vietnam used Latin, Well until I found out missionaries helped make a functional writing system for the Vietnamese language. But even then, there doesn’t seem to be a push for the original script as I visited there before. I can only assume is for convenience. Since learning thousands of characters isn’t the most fun for the illiterate populace who farm all day. But since it’s the modern time.

                              <span>Hi Viet-redditers,
 Probably a long shot 
 I&#x27;m trying to find back a restaurant that I just loved when I was here the last time in 2018.
 It was right in front of the Lapis hotel on Tran Hung Dao (the avenue with all the embassies). Best banh xeo I&#x27;ve ever had + a bunch of other worthy dishes.
 Unexplainably now they put a fake teppanyaki fusion restaurant instead.
 I asked the girl at the entrance and she told me it might have moved to Le Duan Street - but I&#x27;m not sure if she actually understood that I was looking for that specific restaurant.
 Does anybody here know the name? 
 If not I&#x27;ll take other good banh xeo suggestions too (in Hanoi)
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi Viet Nam!
 Over the last year or two, I&#x27;ve been coming across articles about how major smartphone manufacturers have been increasingly shifting operations towards India and Viet Nam.
 As you know, China has been pretty much the &quot;factory of the world&quot; over the last 2 decades and her socioeconomic transformation has been astounding over the same period to say the least. Sadly, I was too young to pay attention then.
 Because of a rapidly aging population and diminishing workforce, cost of labour in China has risen exponentially. Coupled with constant, multi-front geopolitical tensions, one can understand why having operations in China faces a diminishing risk-reward ratio.
 Looking at Vietnam&#x27;s Balance of Trade, I see that it&#x27;s surged post-2015, around the time the protectionist Trump administration got elected - which I suppose accelerated the trend of de-coupling from China. However, the Vietnamese Dong seems to be facing a constant weakening, unlike that of an export hub. Somehow, I never see reports about how these winds are affecting regular Vietnamese citizens.
 Have you noticed a surge in manufacturing activity in Viet Nam?
 If so, how has this impacted you? 
 Has the surge been driven by MNCs setting up their own plants, or have they been subcontracting to local manufacturers?
 Also, have these factories been concentrated in particular regions and therefore limited in benefit?
 Do you think Viet Nam will experience the same breakneck growth in the next decade as China did?
 I&#x27;m excited to hear the perspectives of people living through the change!

                              <span>There is a beach festival is going on now in Nha Trang. It&#x27;s suppose to start on the 3rd of June (according to the receptionist), but they have already practicing from the 30th of May. I don&#x27;t mind the noise if it&#x27;s until 22:00, heck even 00:00 is fine. But it&#x27;s 01:50 AM and those motherfuckers are still singing and blasting EXTREMELY LOUD music. Nobody was able to sleep. Many tourists and visitors are staying near the beach, around the area. There are many hotels. Many have toddlers that need to sleep early. Many have tours that start as early as 7am-8am in the morning.
 Tried to call the police for the noise pollution and they&#x27;re useless. &quot;Oops we can&#x27;t do anything uwu&quot; 😑. Heard a similar situation happened in Nha Trang during Tet as well. Is this only in Nha Trang specifically or does it occurred in other cities in Vietnam as well? 
 Update: The Khanh Hoa province posted this news today in the 31st of May, to remind everyone about the laws and rules.
 https://khanhhoa.gov.vn/vi/tin-tuc-noi-bat/phong-chong-vi-pham-phap-luat-trong-hoat-dong-van-hoa-the-thao-va-du-lich-3005
 Noise pollution is illegal in Vietnam and organisers have to follow the laws created by the Vietnam government. If laws are broken and not being followed, expecting some fine.
 &quot;Kết quả, Thanh tra Bộ Văn hóa, Thể thao và Du lịch đã xử phạt vi phạm hành chính đối với 5 tổ chức, cá nhân có hành vi vi phạm với tổng số tiền xử phạt 340.000.000 đồng.&quot;

                              <span>I’ve got a month off in August/September, flying in and out of HCMC. This will be my first time in South East Asia, so I’m looking for some recommendations for some less touristy places to see. I prefer nature activities, hiking, historical landmarks, temples etc over cities and urban areas. Would love to be able to do some hiking, and I’m also looking into the Ha Giang loop, but otherwise very open to suggestions.

                              <span>I know. Is a difficult topic. But I just need to understand. I’m Argentinian grown up in Italy and living in Spain since 20 years. Basically I’m always a foreign and I know “difficult” people are everywhere.. I’m in Vietnam at the moment and this is being a bit difficult. I always try to smile and Learn the language, at least to say “please” “thanks” “hello” “very good” etc. In HCMC starts with some yelling and pointing fingers and laughing. In Da Lat some being attended with angry looks. In Nha Trang at the bus counter they even don’t want to sell me the tickets for my next destination and turning the face like I wasn’t there… at the hotel, the manager, was asking me if I taken something from the “minibar” ( literally 4 Pepsi cans ) 4 time in a row aggressively and threatening with checking the room…. Should I assume that’s the treatment that I’ll have all around the country? Of course there where people that wanted to help, but at the moment seems they are the minority… and please don’t read this as pointing fingers or in any bad way. As I said I just want to understand. Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone! I´m using the &quot;Assimil&quot; language course book for self study to learn Vietnamese. 
 Yesterday tho, I watched a video about the usage of Vietnamese pronouns by Tieng Viet Oi, which is a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching Vietnamese, and they explained the use of the pronouns in a completely different way than my course book uses them!
 Now I feel insecure and I don´t know, if I should keep on using my course book, because I don´t want to learn this major part of the language in a wrong way! I don´t doubt, that the infos given by Tieng Viet Oi are wrong, because they´re native speakers, but maybe my book uses rules that they left out? I don´t know! Can you native speakers out there tell me, if this use of the pronouns makes any sense, or if my course book isn´t a good source?
 ​
 1.Dialogue:
 Person1, Stranger: calls other cô / Person2, stranger: calls other ông - formal setting
 2.Dialogue
 Person1, waiter: calls other bà / Person2, customer: calls other ông - restaurant order
 3.Dialogue
 Person1, knows other person, not closest friends: calls other anh / Person2, same as other: calls other chi (dot under i) - colloquial talk
 ​
 --&gt; also the book explains the pronouns as:
 -cô: young women or women who aren´t married
 -ông: men older than 40 years
 -bà: elderly women or married women
 -anh/chi(dot): people you know and that are around your age
 ​
 (it doesn´t really consider the relationship between the speaker and the other person!)
 ​
 I´m sorry for the long post! I´d really appreciate any adivce, because I fell in love with the Vietnamese language and I just want to keep on studying! Thanks a lot and have a wonderful day!

                              <span>We have travelled a lot all over the world together, and would do loads of activities during the day, chill on the beach, go for dinner and drinks in the evening. Obviously that has all changed, all of our plans have been cancelled so essentially starting from scratch except for the flights from Europe to Asia. It’s 3 weeks so was planning Hanoi, Chiang Mai, Koh Samui and Hoi An. Honestly my main worry is that I could be days not talking to people and be lonely. I’m introverted as is my partner but we always had each other, we are very friendly but in short conversations normally. I’m a bit lost as to what to do and half considering just not going and losing the money on the flights and maybe doing shorter trips around Europe. From being in a relationship so long it’s almost like you lose confidence alone I think and rely on the other person.

                              <span>1700km along the coast from Hanoi to HCMC 
 Recently I ran from Hue to DaNang(100km) in a day for charity. 
 I’m now planning what to do next and am thinking Hanoi to HCMC would be great. 
 Do you know anyone who has done this? If so, I’d love to talk with them about the challenge so I can be as prepared as possible. 
 Id like to raise money for children in need here in Vietnam. What charities do you think need the most support? 
 Does this sound like an event you would like to join or support? If so, message me. The bigger the tribe, the better the vibe. 
 Thanks ya’ll

                              <span>Hi, I am Thai and my husband is Irish. We both have been living in Vietnam for the past 6 years and will move back to Ireland this August. We plan to get a mortgage once we arrive, and one of the documents required from some Irish banks is a foreign credit check. 
 Has anyone ever obtained this from Vietnam? We contacted our banks (Vietcomebank and standard chartered bank) and were told that they could not provide the credit check. Any lead would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I hope this is allowed. My partner and I are planning on moving to Vietnam in 2024 to teach. We’re from South Africa. We are aware that the school year starts around April but we would like to come sooner (Jan/Feb). We are considering volunteering through WorkAway for the first few months before trying to find jobs. We’re wondering how the visa process works: are we still only allowed to stay for 30 days on a tourist visa or is it possible to obtain an extended visa with the help of a host from WorkAway? Or will we have to do visa runs? Because we’re planning on finding jobs while in Vietnam, we’d also like to know what documents we’ll need to apply for jobs and obtain a long stay visa. We’d really appreciate any info and advise! TIA

The most popular ones are Anh Bushcraft and Ana Bushcraft. Does anyone have any backstory on them ? Are these their personal channels or is it the tourism ministry ?

                              <span>Hey everyone! I&#x27;m going to Vietnam soon (I&#x27;m American) to meet my Vietnamese girlfriend&#x27;s family. We&#x27;ve been together for a while and we&#x27;re getting married soon. The thing is, her family might not be too accepting of our relationship because they have super traditional views. Her family matters to her a lot, and I want to give them a good impression (or at least not a horrible one). 
 Any tips or suggestions on how I can approach this? Her family doesn&#x27;t come from wealth, so I was thinking of giving a hundred or so USD dollars to each member of her close family (though I don&#x27;t come from wealth either, a hundred goes a lot further over there than it does in the USA, and I thought it might be a good small amount), a couple nice gifts from America, and then of course showing respect and kindness at all times. 
 But to be honest, I&#x27;m not sure where to go from there. Is there anything I can do to make them really like me despite their traditional views? Or at least even out the scale of hate vs. like haha?

 I’ve got a layover at Ho Chi Minh and my flight has been rescheduled to the next day.
 Am I able to get a visa on arrival ( Australian passport )
 If not are there facilities at the airport?
 I land at 16:00 and my flight has been changed to 07:00am the next day

 Last week, our parents came to Aus and discussed solutions. His parents want me to move to Vietnam, give birth to the baby and live there. His dad will give us a nice apartment in Hanoi. He wants my boyfriend to work in a Vietnamese car company. His mom said she would help me to get a job in a foreign bank ( I have no idea how she does that, bc I don’t speak Vietnamese fluently, I just…</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s something strange about food signs all over Vietnam. I mean the signs on the street saying &quot;Bún Chả&quot;, &quot;Mì Quảng&quot; and so on. Many of them seem to follow standard designs, they have the same fonts and colors. 
 Another thing I found unique about Vietnam is that these big signs show food names rather than business names. 
 This makes me wonder: are these signs designed and subsidised by some government agency? Was there a government program that made all food signs look similar to reach other?

                              <span>Hey folks.
 I have several nieces and nephews in the 12-15 age range in south of Rach sỏi, along the delta. I wanted to send them each a story book to help with their interest in reading. I was thinking a Vietnamese translation of the Harry Potter series, but thought I’d ask here to see if there might be some other local recommendations that the kids may have better resonance with. (I’d have my aunt procure them locally, as she lives in rạch giá).
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! I’m getting married this weekend to my fiancée, whose parents emigrated from Vietnam to USA in the late 70’s. I’m very close with her parents. I have no Vietnamese/Asian heritage myself, if that’s relevant.
 I’d like to do a special mother-in-law/son-in-law dance at the western reception, but it’s hard to find a suitable song. I want to find a song in Vietnamese for a slow dance that is appropriate coming from a son-in-law. Many songs about mothers talk about the mother raising the singer, which isn’t genuine to our relationship. I’m hoping to find a song whose lyrics work coming from me.
 Do you know of any sweet, heartfelt songs in Vietnamese that are about a mother-in-law? Or about a mother, but without focusing on how the mother raised the singer? Or a song about an amazing, strong person without any romantic subtext?
 My fiancée’s cousin helped me find Mẹ Yêu by Đỗ Phú Quí, which sounds perfect, but reading a translation of the lyrics, seems to focus too much on how the mother raised the singer. But maybe the sentiment would still work?
 Thank you for helping me make the day special for my (soon-to-be) mother-in-law!

                              <span>My cousin and I are planning a trip to southeast Asia from mid-November thru early December. Most likely a November 14 departure and a December 3-4 return. We are both guys in our mid/late 20s from Los Angeles. We like nature (hiking + excursions), nature sightseeing, large cities, food, and partying.
 We were set on doing 2 weeks in Thailand but are now considering adding 4-5 days in Vietnam due to the recommendations of many family members &amp; friends.
 Our initial plan was to do 3-5 days in Bangkok &amp; Pattaya and then travel south for the remainder of the trip to see Phuket and Koh Phi Phi.
 So my main question is this: If we have 4-5 days, how would you recommend we spend it in Vietnam? Bangkok and Hanoi? Is it possible to truly experience these 2 major Vietnamese cities in that short of time? Should we omit one? Maybe reduce some of our time in Thailand?
 I understand there are dozens of great places we&#x27;ll be missing... But I am hoping some seasoned travelers or residents of either country can give feedback/advice. It is MUCH appreciated!!

                              <span>Been quoted a starting salary, seems alright compared to other options (slightly less then I&#x27;m making working 4 days a week but 12 hours of working, or waiting for a night class), but has Wondering if anyone has taught here.
 I am have a degree in education, am certified teacher in history and English in the United States, as well as have my tefl, a year and a half experience teaching ESL, and about a year in public school in the US. The position they are hiring for is not ESL, but ELA (also potentially a humanities position)
 Any info on average salary and benefits for someone with my credentials, work environment, curriculum, management, etc would be geatly appreciated.
 Main interest is if summer breaks are paid. Also the real amount of work load.
 Thanks a ton! Want to work for a good school longterm .

                              <span>According to Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Thanh Lam, Vietnam leads the world in cyber abuse to cheat and violate the law.
 At the Multi-Channel Management Networking Workshop on the morning of May 27 in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Nguyen Thanh Lam said:
 &quot;For every 100 dong earned from cheating on YouTube, there are 55 dong of Vietnamese users. We are at the top of the list for copyright infringement. There is a football livestream channel that violates copyright like Xoi Lac TV. There is a channel that buys Japanese porn, cuts it into many short clips, and then packs it and sells it to the American audience.&quot;
 Lam said the country in second place in the ranking accounts for only 5% of fraudulent income, one-tenth of Vietnam. Last week, Apple also announced to remove more than 8,000 infringing applications originating in Vietnam, many of which are content creation applications.
 The deputy minister said that this is a sad record, exposing the fact that besides positive content, many creators still do business and make money regardless. Part of the responsibility lies with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook when they can&#x27;t control the content and users on the platform. Advertisers also have a responsibility to still spend money on dirty content.
 &quot;The state does not prevent businesses from wanting to advertise in cyberspace, but it is impossible for a money to flow into malicious content that businesses still see as normal,&quot; Mr. Lam said.

                              <span>Hi!
 We are 3 girls planning a quick getaway trip to Hanoi and Cat Ba island from 28th September-2nd October. Unfortunately we are short on time and so we have planned this itinerary:
 ​
 - Land in Hanoi on 28th Morning, leave directly for Cat Ba, stay in a resort/hotel
 - Leave Cat Ba on 30th Morning, come back to Hanoi, get an AirBnB in/near Old Quarter
 - Checkout on 2nd morning and take the evening flight back to our country
 ​
 I read alot of posts on travelling to Hanoi/Vietnam and I am honestly with too much information and figured it would be better to ask here. Please help me out!
  
Is Cat Ba Island worth it? We wanted to avoid the crowd in Ha Long Bay, but stay near the sea and relax. 
 Any suggestions for Cat Ba, like places to eat/ things to do/ places to stay?
 Best way to travel from Hanoi to Cat Ba and back?
 For Hanoi, we have Egg Coffee, Bahn Mi (and a lot more food items) and Beer Street on our list already, but any hidden/hole in the wall places that are away from commercial tourism would be great to know. Very open to trying authentic vietnamese food and drinks!! 
 Any suggestions for a reputable spa experience in Cat Ba or Hanoi are most welcome
 Any suggestions for where to go for a party in Hanoi? We will be there during the weekend
  
Thank you for taking the time out to read this and so sorry if its a long post!

 I don’t have any experience with teaching so it’ll just be basic vocabulary and sentence structures
 What would be the best free platform to host classes? How should I go about teaching?

                              <span>Like many of you, I am increasingly concerned by the hate and hostility that I see every day in this beautiful community, especially between Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans. 😔 
 It is my firm believe that in our time and age, nothing is more important than mutual respect and understanding. So, in this spirit, I propose a new Vietnamese flag that symbolizes the indestructible friendship between the North and South; a new flag free of bad connotations; a flag that combines the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam. 
 As we strive to foster stronger connections between Vietnamese wherever they may reside or what they believe, it is essential to have a symbol that represents our shared values of friendship and understanding; representing multiculturalism, love, diversity, respect and mutual understanding 🤝🌍
 https://preview.redd.it/002tzmjnop2b1.png?width&#x3D;1000&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;v&#x3D;enabled&amp;s&#x3D;4fee59796edb5dd67668bdff04b4be0a250ccd22
 This proposed flag aims to honor Vietnam&#x27;s rich cultural heritage and traditions (blue) and emphasizes the significance of unity and cooperation (red). The Golden Star represents the everlasting bond between Vietnam&#x27;s people and their striving for greatness and prosperity for all Vietnamese people, regardless of their geographical location or political stances.
 With my loving heart, I invite every one of you to print this flag out, show it to your parents and especially grandparents and display it proudly in your windows. Let&#x27;s propagate the message of love and friendship. Because only as an undivided ONE we can overcome the hate that has tormented this beautiful land for far too long ❤️❤️❤️❤️

                              <span>Planning a trip to ho chi minh for 7 days. Is it way too long? Seems like you can travel the entire Vietnam for that time if you touch and go however it&#x27;s my first time there and I don&#x27;t want to stress myself out by taking a loooooong train or bus ride (I get motion sickness). The flight is already booked so we have to start and end at hcmc no matter what. 
 What do you recommend? Should I 
  
Take it easy and stay entire week in HCMC and go for day trips to cu chi and mekong delta etc
 
Travel to danang/hoi an via plane/train. Will it be too tiring to go there and back to hcmc in 7 days?
 
Spend the time in South Vietnam, going furthest to muine/nha trang?
 
 Or anything in between? 
 Also, are the roads super difficult to cross? I have huge anxiety about this and when I cross the road usually use traffic lights so I&#x27;m super unconfident.
 Also, I&#x27;m going in august.. read that it&#x27;s the rainy season. Should I give up on seeing the beach entirely?

                              <span>Hi there!
 Just curious what my options are for attempting to do this with my fiancé comfortably able to sit on the back (ideally able to strap a backpack to the back as well).
 5 years ago I drove from Hanoi to Saigon via motorbike (without a doubt the greatest travel experience of my life).
 But now I am coming back for a long honeymoon and what to do the Ha Giang Loop which I sadly missed last time around.
 I own a 1000cc motorcycle back home, and have obviously quite a bit of experience driving in Vietnam in previous trips. However, with a second person attached to the back this gets a bit trickier.
 I want something that will comfortable seat both of us for long stints of the drive, and ideally I want to rent this time and not purchase. What do you guys recommend?

                              <span>Hi, I will be doing a 10 day tour in vietnam. Planning to arrive in Ho chi minh city and depart at Hanoi. Flying from HCMC to Hanoi during day 5.
 Currently plan would be 5 days in each city. Looking to visit historical sites and have some good food. Is there any recommended cities other than those?

                              <span>Chào! I’m currently in Vietnam and I have an SSD that is physically broken and cannot be repaired with software. My PC can detect that something is connected but when I try to open it, it doesn’t work. I’ve tried different ways but I’m sure it’s physical damage. Unfortunately, all the pictures of my father who passed away last year are on that SSD (except for some on Facebook). Do you have any recommendations for data recovery services in Hanoi? I will be there next week and I’m hoping to find something there. Cam on guys

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am planning a 16 days trip to North and Central Vietnam this December. Flying into Hanoi and out from Da Nang. 
 I have shortlisted these places.
 Hanoi,
 Ha Long Bay,
 Sapa,
 Ninh Binh,
 Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park,
 Hue,
 Hoi An
 Da Nang.
 16 days is definately too short to visit them all yea? Which one should I miss if so.
 I love nature, history and culture but am also a budget traveler.
 Sorry if I posted at the wrong subreddit.
 Cheers

 I remember hearing from someone there is a Belgian guy who owns a bar in Mui Ne that sells Duval beer on draft and in bottles. Is this true and if yes, does anyone know the name?
 Thanks.

                              <span>In recent years, Vietnam has been making strides in the world of technology and innovation. With the rise of start-ups and the increasing number of high-tech companies moving their branch offices to Vietnam, is there a possibility that Vietnam, this Southeast Asian nation, could become the next start-up nation in Asia?
 The shift from China to Vietnam has been noticeable, with companies such as Samsung, LG, and Intel all establishing a strong presence in Vietnam. This trend is not limited to just large corporations, as start-ups are also finding success in Vietnam&#x27;s growing tech scene.
 One reason for Vietnam&#x27;s appeal is its young and highly educated population. According to the World Bank, nearly 60% of Vietnam&#x27;s population is under the age of 35, and the country boasts a literacy rate of over 95%. This has created a strong talent pool for tech companies to draw from.
 Another factor contributing to Vietnam&#x27;s potential as a start-up nation is its favorable business environment. The Vietnamese government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurship. The country has also made significant improvements in infrastructure, including expanding its internet connectivity and investing in new technology parks.
 However, there are still challenges that Vietnam must overcome in order to fully realize its potential as a start-up nation. One major hurdle is the lack of venture capital funding available for start-ups. While the government has taken steps to address this issue, more needs to be done in order to attract investment and support the growth of new businesses.

                              <span>Just came across this event, looks like it&#x27;s happening on the same days when I&#x27;m in Danang :) Question for locals who&#x27;ve been to the festival before, do I need to buy any tickets for this show? My understanding is it happens on the Han River, so perhaps would be viewable from nearby roads/bridges. Is it worth to buy the tickets explicitly or just enjoy the show for free from outside?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’m currently in HCM and want to get some new glasses since it’s quite affordable. Can anyone who has done it compare the quality of lenses and coatings to those done in the US? Are there any recommendations for places to get them done? Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hi
 I am making plans to visit Vietnam for the first time, landing in Hanoi and planning to spend around a month here. I would love to visit HCMC and do the hiang loop also.
 My concern is with the street dogs that I have seen online in the SEA countries especially in Thailand and I was wondering what the reality of the situation is in Vietnam.
 I am at the level where if I see a dog I will cross the road or go the other way.
 I’ve heard that pretending to pick up a rock and holding a stick / umbrella is good defence.
 Is it realistic for me to have a good time in Vietnam (especially if most my time will be on group tours and city) with the dog population?
 Mainly my fear is with dogs off lead and more so feral/wild/street dogs in packs.
 Thank you very much and apologies for the errors question, I know that dog phobia is not common and that most people love dogs - trust me I do too but I cannot lie about the reality that I fear dogs.

                              <span>Hi,
 I’m considering taking a morning bus form Sa pa to Noi bat airport in Hanoi to fly to my next destination (Da nang) The bus Leaves at 5:45 and arrives directly at the airport, scheduled to arrive at 10:50
 Now, as a first time traveler to vietnam, I will have never taken one of the buses there. Is a flight booked for 13:05 cutting it to close considering the possibility of delays? Would 14:00 be a safer bet? 
 Thank you!!!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been thinking about visiting Saigon/ HCM City this July (would be my first time in Vietnam) but I&#x27;m kinda worried about the humidity, the heat and the rain. 
 From what I&#x27;ve seen the weather seems to be more bearable than in Hanoi but I&#x27;m not quite sure in how far it would allow me to do sightseeing and stuff throughout the day.
 So I was wondering if someone could tell me about the personal experiences in Saigon around this time of year. Do tourists usually visit there in summer? Do public buildings, restaurants and trains have AC? Do locals spend time outside during the day or do they usually try to stay inside?
 Pretty much what I wanna know is if I&#x27;ll be able to have a good time despite the warm weather and rain. I live in Europe and the climate here is quite different from SE Asia, so apologies if some of my questions come across as naive or uneducated. 
 Either way, I know there&#x27;s no definitive answer to this, but any helpful advice is much appreciated!

                              <span>So there a Vietnamese channel that buy youtube ad service to promote recently and one of it famous video is about the YouTubers feed a cat that got chained. As many people said it kinda disturbing bc things like that in their country consider as animal abuse immediately but in VietNam it a dangerous environment in the city if you let your cat roam outside. Also about the physical interact that look like slap actually is a pat but Im not sure bc it a child hit💀. Cats can easily accident unalived by many reasons in my country but I not support thing like that, it just most necessary still depend on the owner and the situation.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ll be visiting Danang from 15th to 19th June. Wanted to check if I&#x27;ll be able to rent a car for self-drive? Scooty will not be an option for me since I&#x27;ll be traveling in a family of 4. I have an Indian driving license. Is that sufficient? Should I get an International Driving Permit? With an IDP can I legally drive around Danang-Hoi An in a car?
 Thanks in Advance!

 I am traveling via motorbike and need to find this ASAP as I’ve almost run out! I assumed pharmacies would carry it but that appears to be incorrect. 
 Is there a glasses shop/optometrist in any of the towns on the loop (I’m in Dong Van now), Ha Giang town, or in Cao Bang town maybe?? Google maps doesn’t show anything.. 
 Would be a stupid reason to cut my trip short! 😫

                              <span>I ordered a grab and when it showed up it was a taxi. He started the meter when I got in and when I said no meter, he just said &#x27;no&#x27;, and threw a hat on top of the meter. When I got to my destination he just accepted the grab fee.
 Just wondering what was going on with that?
 PS. He threw the hat in front of the meter and I could still see the fare in the reflection of the windshield. It started off at 10k and rose very slowly. Then randomly jumped to 500k, 1 million before reaching 2 million by the end. The fare ended up being 41k on grab.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to remember something one of my ex-girlfriends use to call me.
 I think it&#x27;s this word, &quot;Dâm tặc&quot;.
 I think this word means &quot;horny dog&quot; or something about being horny. However when I Google translate it says that it means thieves.
 Could someone confirm to me that &quot;Dâm tặc&quot; can mean horny? I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this is the word she use to call me, I just Googled how I think it was spelled and it came up.
 Thanks in advance~!

                              <span>I had an extemely bad experience this morning while walking in Can Tho.
 I have been living in Can Tho since 2011. The city once was really nice, but lately I feel unwelcome and uncomforable here. What I experienced this morning confirms my feelings the more.
 I work self-employed, so I can manage my time. Every morning I take a walk (actually, I want to jog, but the heat...). So I am walking down Nguyen Viet Hong, turn then into a small hem and come out at Le Lai. From there I need to cross the Pham Van Tri and enter the park (Luu Huu Phuoc). Easy. I&#x27;ve been doing it for a long time.
 This morning, when I approached the corner Le Lai/Pham Van Tri, a young Vietnamese, apparently agitated, was standing there. He threw with things onto the cars and motorbikes. I must have looked bewildered. …</span>

                              <span>I worked part-time at a hotel for a few months (as a second job so that I could make a little extra money).
 My co-worker (22 year-old Vietnamese woman who recently graduated from College) came up to me and gave me a $10 Starbucks card on my last day of work.
 I was surprised as her and I got along well when we worked together (but we rarely saw each other/rarely worked together as it is a big hotel).
 I am a 40-year old man and have had many jobs and this is the first time that a co-worker has done this. I think it is very nice.
 Her and I have contact on Linkedin.
 I don&#x27;t mean to &quot;keep score&quot;, but there is something nice that I would like to do for her. Suggestions?
 As an aside: At work I was busy and I never paid much attention to her. In looking back she was very hard working and kind. I have travelled to Japan, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Laos, South Korea, Malaysia and Kong Kong but for some reason I overlooked Vietnam. She got me thinking of Vietnam and I have since developed an interest in travelling there and have read many good things about Vietnamese women.
 Obviously I am not going to be in a relationship with her (not likely with any Vietnamese American for that matter: even in big/diverse cities the Vietnamese are likely less than 1% of the population and moving to Vietnam is not an option).
 Still nice to know that such people exist however.

                              <span>I have family members in Vietnam that I&#x27;d like to buy gifts for. However, I don&#x27;t have any Vietnamese bank accounts (all my bank accounts/credit cards are registered abroad). I&#x27;ve tried Shopee, but they rejected all of my cards (Visa and Mastercard).
 Are there other platforms (that operate/are based in Vietnam) that take international-based credit cards? I&#x27;m open to opening a bank account with international banks like HSBC if that helps. As mentioned in the title, I also have CCND and can open a Vietnamese-based bank account, but I&#x27;m not too sure how the process works.

                              <span>Is there a law or regulation that says after 01 January 2023 people who did not convert CMND to CCCD will have their name in the Ho Khau removed by the police?? I was told by someone who is lying to me or it is true. But I find there is nothing in law that says so EXCEPT from 01 January 2023 Ho Khau is being discontinued

                              <span>Xin chào,
 I&#x27;m seeking ideas for small presents for a family.
 What would be welcome or useful that I can get in europe?
 Have been thinking of electronics, basic foodstuffs and also tools useful for people in the countryside.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi all! I have a conference coming up and it&#x27;s been a longtime wish to visit your amazing country. I&#x27;m planning to spend about 2 weeks afterwards, starting around Ho Chi Minh. 
 I&#x27;m thinking about taking the ~12 days guided motorcycle trip to Hanoi then flying back, that sounds simply amazing. But good alternatives would be spending some more time in the city and taking my time in the south instead. I love a good hike or some local culture and would hate to rush things.
 What would be your thoughts on how best to spend the time?
