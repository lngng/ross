                              <span>When the Soviet Invade Afghanistan, what was Vietnam reaction, and what news did Vietnam hear from the Soviet Afghan war.
 I hear this a lot how that Soviet Afghan War is the Soviet version of the Amercian Vietnam War. Would you say it a good comparison. While the outcomes are super different because one country (Vietnam) is now stable and very good economy, while the other (Afghanistan) is now being ruled by a radical religion group that terrorize its own citizens. 
 However, both countries commit the worst war crimes in though wars, which cause a lot of political backlashed from the international community and their allies:
 USA in Vietnam: Phoenix Program, Tiger Force, Agent Orange, My Lai massacre, Thạnh Mỹ massacre, Thủy Bồ incident, Rape during the Vietnam War, Incident on Hill 192, Sơn Thắng massacre, Operation Speedy Express, Côn Đảo Prison, Phú Quốc Prison, List of bombing campaigns of the Vietnam War, 1963 South Vietnamese coup d&#x27;état, Gulf of Tonkin incident Lie, Operation Barrel Roll, 1970 Cambodian coup d&#x27;état,
 Causalities: 1,326,494–3,447,494 dead (some sources even claim 5 million people died) 
 Soviet Union: Tajbeg Palace assault, Laghman massacre, Padkhwab-e Shana massacre, Baraki Barak massacre, Kulchabat, Bala Karz and Mushkizi massacre, Kunduz massacre, 1980 student protests in Kabul, Rauzdi massacre, 3 Hoot uprising, Report Soviet troops raped Afghan women, 4 SOVIET DESERTERS TELL OF CRUEL AFGHANISTAN WAR, Chemical Warfare (Moscow&#x27;s Poison War), agriculture destruction (The War In Afghanistan: Soviet Strategy and The State of the Resistance), KHAD, 
 Here a very good video: How The Afghans Defeated The Soviet Union
 Causalities: 562,000–2,000,000 killed (Some sources even claim up to 3 million) 
 with 5 million externally displaced and 2 million internally displaced which make around that Approximately 6.5% to 11.5% of Afghanistan lose it population to the soviets.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for Vietnamese-speaking local guide (English NOT required) I speak Vietnamese semi-fluently and can 100% understand Vietnamese when spoken with a southern accent (I struggle a bit more with Northern and Hue accents but can probably manage. I can read very poorly but could get by if it was a life or death situation). What would be a good way to find a local guide who can dedicate 2-4 weeks to showing me around the entire country? 
 I feel this would be a good opportunity for a recent grad who wants to practice English (with someone who is fluent in both English and Vietnamese) and to go on a free vacation (with modest base pay ~$500USD for one month and basic essentials like food, lodging, etc.) covered. I would also prefer it if they are a woman (because I am female and would feel more comfortable with another woman) who knows how to drive a car/motorbike and who has experience traveling in VN. Am I being unreasonable/ too demanding?
 If it isn&#x27;t clear, I am asking here because I feel most of the options I see are group tours geared towards tourists who have 0 understanding of Vietnamese language and culture and rely purely on English-speaking guides and tours. I don&#x27;t really want to do these tours because they seem waay overpriced and limit what you can see or do based on availability of English-speakers. They also seem to cater to a western audience and I am not interested in that.

                              <span>I&#x27;m 26yo, and I recently visited Vietnam for the 2nd year in a row and this time for 4 months (3 visa runs). I&#x27;m now back in my home country and I&#x27;m really interested in living in Vietnam long term. I&#x27;ve looked at the visa options and job opportunities and I don&#x27;t have a degree so the visa option I&#x27;m most interested in is the Investor Visa, invest 130k usd into an existing business in Vietnam or I can open a franchise like 7/11, GS25, Family Mart etc. I would not have to run it but it would be an Absentee Owner business, which I&#x27;ve read is very common in Vietnam and then I could get a 1 year Investor visa which can be renewed 5 times (5 years). It would be something for 2-3 years from now, so I can increase my income potential to be able to have the capital to be a foreign investor.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving there after the next Tet holiday. Until then I have to save some money. 
 I don&#x27;t have any college degree, probably just making some minimum wage. The only reason I wanna move is because I&#x27;m gay and the gay community is much larger there. I feel like I belong there instead of Hanoi where I&#x27;m living right now because of that
 But I have no specialized skill, with little money, which district is cheaper to live in Saigon?

                              <span>I have been working in Vietnam for 4 years. And I always find it baffling how I am treated by Vietnamese employers, am I the only one? 1. Many don’t like face to face confrontation or honest conversations… 2. Many never tell the truth, but always go around in circles to lie and you have to decipher what is true and what isn’t. 3. Never straightforward and honest. 4. Always the last person to find out anything even when it’s been planned for weeks, you will get told on the day or the day before or not Al all.

                              <span>Just overheard an older lady send back ice because she couldn’t get a clear answer if it was made with filtered water or not and it got me curious if using filtered is standardised these days, even for small street stalls. 
 I’ve had all sorts of drinks and ice from nice cafes and restaurants to bars and random off street hawkers with no major issue so far. 
 Do I have a reason to feel smug about having a strong stomach or have I just been lucky?

                              <span>So i work for a VNese company remotely, all was fine until a Hanoi-an guy joined the team.
 That guy has such bossy attitude and acts like the manager, he is younger but act like he is more experienced and like my all years of experience is nothing.
 We had a Hanoi-an lady work with us too, seemed not friendly or helpful at all. I thought maybe its a female thing.
 Lately i have noticed Hanoians have some major issue with southern and expats. He has the mindset hanoi team is far better , i mean fuck you bro, i taught you soo much as mentor and you act like this.
 I am even an year older than him, i always thought VN respect elders
 I told the guy to F-off, as an expat remote female employee i was very shocked and hurt by his behavior.
 Strange jealousy or acting like no one is better than him.
 So are Northern very cold towards expats? Its my bad luck, i met the wrong one 😔 😭

                              <span>Just generally wondering as a foreigner if it’s common across most Vietnamese.
 I started a small food business just recently and even as a foreigner of Chinese descent (not buddhist or taoist though), I feel some Vietnamese people seem to take superstitions quite seriously, some of which is trying to say if something “unlucky” happens, it is a good sign for something lucky to come.
 Some examples: 1. Hitting the table or something metallic hardly - will bring in customers 2. Accidentally breaking glass - good sign for attracting customers 3. Raining on opening day (especially if it’s right after you done opening day prayers) - business will flourish
 What are some others you have heard?

                              <span>I got into a scuffle the other day with a guard demanding 20k VND tip for supposedly &quot;guarding&quot; my car.
 Just a quick run through, I parked my car in front of an abandoned empty lot on a quiet Sunday morning and had this guard running from the opposite street (not even opposite, more like a few shops down from directly opposite my car), trying to squeeze in a &quot;service&quot; of opening my car door for me. This same dude then demanded 20K VND as &quot;tip&quot; or &quot;fee&quot; for helping me guard my car. I of course said no because I didn&#x27;t think he deserved it or that he actually owned that spot. He then proceeded to knock heavily on my window and shouted &quot;I watched your car for you, so the fee is 20k!&quot; - Translated by my Vietnamese girlfriend.
 Keep in mind that I&#x27;m not a fan of tipping , and if I must, I believe a tip should be reserved for those who actually deserve it, not a random guy sitting by the corner of the street insisting that he did me a service, like I can&#x27;t open my own car door. Do you guys think this expectation has been terribly manifested by the tipping culture from overseas, and has now deemed as appropriate? or am I just a bad person? Also, not sure why bikes aren&#x27;t subjected to tips but only cars? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all!
 I’m an American currently on a long term travel adventure and I’ve been bouncing all around Europe for a couple of months. I’m planning to head to Vietnam for the first time in a few weeks and I’m looking for a place where I can chill out for a while and truly get to know the culture and people.
 My research has pointed me at Hoi An, but I know it’s quite touristy. That’s ok, as long as I can see some culture as well.
 Some thoughts about what I’m looking for:
  
Smaller city or town is preferred. I’ve been in the massive cities in Europe and I’m ready for a slower pace for a while.
 I speak absolutely no Vietnamese. I have no qualms about using google translate, but I want to visit a place where that wouldn’t be viewed as a negative thing. In other words, someplace tourist friendly, even if it isn’t touristy.
 I tend to love seeing museums and historical sites when I travel, so someplace where at least some of that is available.
 I’m not a digital nomad, but decent internet so I can keep in touch with family and friends would be nice.
 Near a beach, even for day trips would be cool, but in no way a requirement.
  
Any suggestions? Is someplace like Hoi An/Da Nang my best option?
 I appreciate any help or tips!

                              <span>I am of Vietnamese origin but I have been living abroad in Europe. I am currently in Vietnam for three weeks visiting my relatives. 
 The richer part of my family living in Vietnam really wants me to move back to Vietnam and tries to find all ways possible to persuade me, one of the being the rapid improvement of life and presence of many money-making opportunities thanks to the growing economy. 
 It is true that in the last year or two I have ocassionally seen and heard some news about Vietnam&#x27;s rapid development and its increasing direct foreign investment from other countries. The successful relatives really talk nice about the local life and how much better it is from Europe. They have showed me some of the nice places for richer people (I guess only really expensive for locals but affordable for foreigners). 
 Visiting Vietnam I have also seen myself that there has been improvement in Vietnamese infrastructure and services for example. However, I cannot really judge the real situation based on a three-week holiday, neither can I fully rely on my relative&#x27;s point of view since they don&#x27;t have the full knowledge of Europe either and their opinions might be biased.
 I need to have an objective perspective to compare it since I am biased too. How does a real life look like in Vietnam for a (upper) middle class? How would you rate your curent situation, would you move abroad if you could? How good are the international opportunities? As local, what are the things you like and dislike about the Vietnam compared to other countries?

                              <span>I’ve been studying overseas in Canada for more than seven years now so I have no clue what it’s like back in Vietnam’s school culture. 
 According to one of my cousins who has went through middle and highschool though, it is said that they fight… alot. Is this true? and just how brutal are these fights? Like is it just one on one wrestling or full blown gang brawls? I want numbers so I’ll just put a poll up

                              <span>Xin chào! I apologize that I&#x27;m not fluent in Vietnamese, so this post will mainly be in English.
 My mother was born and raised in Vietnam, but immigrated to the US and had me there.
 Today we saw a praying mantis, and my mother talked about how when she grew up in Vietnam, the older people in her town would chew betel nut and put the paste on praying mantises. She mentioned the reasoning behind this practice as that the older people think the praying mantis likes it too.
 This was very surprising and confusing for me, and I tried searching in Google (in English) about this custom. I can find plenty of sources about betel nut chewing in Vietnam, but nothing in particular about putting the paste on praying mantises.
 I don&#x27;t think my mother was joking when she mentioned this, but I just want to hear some verification from other Vietnamese people about this custom. For additional context, she grew up in Phan Rang in Ninh Thuận.

                              <span>I’ve lived in Hanoi for over a year now, I’m going back to England for Christmas this time. I’d like to surprise my loved ones with gifts from Vietnam, what gifts would you recommend? It would be best if they are easily portable, good value and quality, targeted at either gender. Also, the whole point is that the gifts will be authentic and can only be found in Asia. 
 I’ve always struggled to think of Christmas gifts that are different and surprising. I know sometimes it’s best to just buy the more expensive option and call it a day. But I think this year I would like to give out multiple smaller gifts to bring a variety. I’ve got a few ideas but I’m wondering what other people would think of too. Thanks for all the help :))

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m currently exploring the possibility of manufacturing silicone/tpe based products, and I was wondering if any of you might have some insights or recommendations. I want to emphasize that I&#x27;m looking for legitimate manufacturers.
 Here are some specific details about what I&#x27;m looking for:
  
Tooling: We plan to supply our own tooling, so manufacturers who can work with provided molds and specifications would be ideal. However, we&#x27;re also open to exploring the costs of having tooling made in Vietnam if it makes economic sense.
 Manufacturing Location: While we&#x27;re open to manufacturers outside Vietnam, we&#x27;re particularly interested in understanding the manufacturing landscape within Vietnam itself. If you have knowledge about manufacturers in Vietnam or can recommend any reputable companies, please share your insights.
 Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Our initial requirement is a minimum order quantity of 400 units. If you know of manufacturers that can accommodate this quantity or provide competitive pricing at this scale, we&#x27;d greatly appreciate your suggestions.
 Packaging: We plan to handle the packaging ourselves, so manufacturers who can provide the product without packaging would be preferred.
  
Please keep in mind that this inquiry is for legitimate purposes, and I&#x27;m looking for advice on how to approach this inquiry in a responsible manner.
 Feel free to reply here or send me a private message if you prefer to share information privately. I can also explicitly share images of our products as well. I will also be asking you to provide examples of your work.
 Thank you in advance!
 Best.

Can I safely park it on the side of small street between buildings with locked steering and U lock on back wheel for few hours during the day? Just I don&#x27;t want it to get stolen and my VN gf claims that they will steal it 100% (I don&#x27;t trust her VN knowledge, so I&#x27;m asking here😉)

                              <span>I am an average tourist who knew little about vietnam. Coming from a family of die hard communist supporters in India. Read a lot about vietnam war. In fact , its a big reason why I am in Vietnam now. I know life during vacation is different than the actual daily life. But here in this country, I coul relate myself to the people. It&#x27;s not an alien country where everything looks so different. Here I see problems in daily life. I see 5 yr old little girls selling something on the bui vien street. This is heartbreaking. But that&#x27;s the truth. I saw crazy traffic and pollution. Couple of accidents in HCM. Well, feels like India to me. The war museum was absolutely wonderful, shocking, terrifying.

                              <span>This is probably controversial but f it. I’m (31F) solo traveling throughout Vietnam now. First I went to see family in HCM, then I began my solo journey to Hoi An and Da Nang. No issues in either place. but I’ve been in Hanoi since Saturday and walking around I’m noticing a lot of harassment from south Asian tourists . Yesterday I was in Ha Long Bay at the beach and this guy started taking photos of me. Then he came up to me and asked if he could take photos with me, I said no. Another tourist came banging on my hotel door last night on the cruise which scared the crap out of me. I told him to go away. Today I’m back in Hanoi just walking around in the old quarter and a group of them started to stare at me like I was prey. I quickly grabbed my dinner and went back to my hotel.
 I have no issues with south Asians, I have a lot of South Asian friends in the states and also work with them. They are the kindest people. They do not act like this. I just never experienced harassment from like this and it’s kind of bummer it’s happening IN Vietnam. I’m terrified to go out alone now and will probably being taking Grab everywhere for the duration of my stay even if it’s less than 10 minutes away

                              <span>I was born and raised in Vietnam, moved to the states when I was 13. I’m now in my late 20s and have a full time remote job with good pay/benefits. I went back to vietnam about a week ago to attend my cousins weddings and have had so much fun. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m on vacation but I’ve seen Vietnamese people way more relax and not uptight like Americans. Breakfast and cafe in the morning will thousands of options, my cousin here in Vietnam is a freelance video editor and he works whenever and wherever he wants, around noon all the vendors close for a nap time, and at night eat out (again with thousands of options).
 Meanwhile, I work 9-5 in the states with 30mins lunch time but sometimes I eat at my desk. After work, I have to go to the grocery stores or the gym and sometimes too tired to even cook. Weekends I have to do chores and again grocery. It just feels like time is shorter in the states.
 Everything is getting more expensive in the states so my 75k a year salary doesn’t seem much. My fiancé is a teacher so her job is pretty demanding too. 
 I just feel like people in Vietnam just have more what we call ‘freedom’ the U.S has been advertising. I’ve been considering moving back to vietnam for the past few days if I can work remote and my fiancé can teach English but my parents have properties in the states and they have sacrificed so much so I can have the “best” life in America…just some thoughts
 Edit: just to clarify since some people are triggered because I use the word “freedom” what I meant is it just seem that the lifestyle and work style in Vietnam is more relax compared to America but I do understand that I’m here on vacation so people take off work to hang with me

 I buyed today a Viettel SIM card and they gave me five sheets of a list with numbers, words and a price. i had to choose one. The price was different but I did&#x27;t get why. Does somebody know what this list is? What does those words mean? How do those numbers differ? 
 Thanks in advance guys :)

But when I do get given a ticket, It often has &#x27;tay&#x27; written on it. I realised that means westerner, but what&#x27;s all the fuss about? Why am I not treated the same as the locals?

                              <span>Was opening time and initially someone wouldn&#x27;t let me in I showed them the time and so collegue let me in reluctantly.
 Then I walked around the corner and there was about 30 staff lined up on opposite sides of aisle.
 Then I had to walk through them.
 Then they all clapped and bowed
 Does this happen every morning ? Is it an opening morning thing ?

I’ve been to Vietnam before, and even though I can speak to my family, no one in Vietnam could really understand me and kinda mocked me, haha. I want to travel solo to Vietnam but am concerned about making friends. 1. I don’t speak Vietnamese, so it might be hard to make Vietnamese friends. 2. I don’t look like a foreigner, so it might be hard to make foreigner friends. So I’m just looking for tips and advice on meeting people both local and foreigner. TIA

                              <span>I looked online and the only source I could find on the topic was from Quora. They mentioned that the offers are from Grab’s allotted budget for promotions and therefore Grab drivers receive the same amount regardless of discounts applied.
 However, when I booked a Grab ride with the discount, the driver mentioned that he didn’t realize it was a discounted ride and now he’ll receive less than he initially expected. He said that discounted rides means he gets paid less.
 So, how do payments work for discounted rides? I was under the assumption of the first scenario which was why I used offers in the first place.

                              <span>I&#x27;m living in Hanoi, owning a 50cc Cub. I notice that Halong is only 150km away from me, and it&#x27;s possible to drive there my own. I want to take a short trip to relieve some stress
 But my friends told me that it&#x27;s illegal to use such a weak-engine bike to use on highways, that by law 50cc bikes are not allowed on them. And I&#x27;m pretty sure in order to get to Ha Long, I have to be one some highways. Is it illegal to use them on highways? 
 Or is it even possible to go that far with them, since my bike allows only to drive 50 km/h max. It might take long, and my bike might break down if driven at the maximum limit speed for long hours

                              <span>Hey all! I&#x27;m new to this subreddit so pardon me for not knowing how to approach this subject but.. my 19 year old cousin has been alone in Vietnam for a little over a year now. Her final parent, my aunt died a little over a year ago. She&#x27;s a native citizen from Vietnam. I was wondering if my family has any options of bringing her over to the US to live with us? If this is possible I was hoping someone might know the process and the steps required as she is family and we don&#x27;t want her by herself in Vietnam.

                              <span>So! It&#x27;s officially been one month since I moved to Vietnam from America. So far, I&#x27;m really liking the country- even though I know I have plenty of room to grow and get to know it better. Given this, I wanted to ask some more trivial questions and provide some general comments as an adjusting newcomer.
  
Are measuring cups in cooking not a thing here? None of the stores I&#x27;ve found that have kitchen appliances carry them- even the more specialized ones at Aeon Mall.
 Having witnessed the car-clogged streets of Manhattan, I find the constant flow of motorbikes pretty refreshing (even if I&#x27;m terrified to ride one in Ho Chi Minh City).
 I&#x27;ve visited a few Buddhist temples and seen some shrines around, and they often have food in them like apples, kumquats, etc. Is this food for anyone, or does it serve a specific purpose? I don&#x27;t want to take when I&#x27;m not supposed to. EDIT: Answered! I will not take that food.
 I&#x27;m still bemused by how frequently I see Lotso Bear. He seems to be pretty popular independent of Toy Story, and I&#x27;m not quite sure why.
 I hear that avoiding eye contact is generally used when Vietnamese people are frustrated, since they want to avoid direct confrontation. I&#x27;ve always struggled with eye contact (I&#x27;m on the autism spectrum), so would Vietnamese people read that as a sign of anger or hostility?
  
God knows, I have plenty more thoughts, but I&#x27;ve worked through a lot of those with some of my friends. Thank you in advance for your input. I&#x27;m happy to be here.

                              <span>Im currently in Hanoi with my vietnamese GF. Were from Germany and are here for 5 days before we leave for South Korea, then Japan and after that to Saigon.
 My gf wants to go to Phu Quoc as she really wants to be at a nice beach whereas i want to go to Bangkok as the weather is way too hot and humid for me to enjoy it in Phu Quoc and i would stay mostly inside in Bangkok. Also i heard from alot of friends and people living in Vietnam that Phu Quoc will be 50% rain at the time we would go there (16th Oct). Also i think the remaining time we have would be too long for a trip to phu quoc (1 Week).
 What would you guys recommend? Is there maybe a nice beach not too far from Bangkok?
 Thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>Mình có một anh bạn trai kém tuổi. Tụi mình yêu nhau đã được 1 năm, thời gian yêu nhau mình biết ảnh không có kinh tế nên hỗ trợ ảnh rất nhiều. Cụ thể là tiền thuê nhà, chi phí sinh hoạt, ăn uống hàng ngày mình đều lo cho ảnh mỗi ngày kể từ khi yêu nhau. Ảnh thì đi xin việc ở đâu cũng bị từ chối do có hình xăm nên tính ra từ khi mới yêu ảnh mới đi làm khoảng 3 tháng (không liền nhau). Thời gian còn lại lúc nào cũng kè kè bên mình. Mình luôn động viên ảnh và chỉ yêu cầu ảnh hỗ trợ mình làm 1 vài việc chân tay. Ảnh có cơ thể khá yếu nên hay kêu mệt mỏi với mình, nhiều lúc ốm mình cũng đưa ảnh đi viện để truyền và mua thuốc cho ảnh. Thật sự với mình như vậy là mình quá cảm thông cho ảnh rồi. Nhưng cho đến hôm trước mình như tức nước vỡ bờ. Ảnh mới kiếm được 1 công việc phục vụ 5 tiếng 1 ngày thì tối ảnh tan ca qua đón mình. Đó là ngày thứ 3 anh đi làm. Như mọi hôm mình đưa anh qua cửa hàng tiện lợi mua mì và nước cho ảnh hồi sức. Sau đó bọn mình có chơi game 1 lúc rồi lại về nhà mình ăn cơm và xem phim, sau đó mình cũng gọi nước sinh tố về cho anh bồi bổ. Ăn xong mình chỉ nhờ ảnh rửa bát, lúc mình bảo thì ảnh không nói gì với mình mà cứ lẳng lặng đi làm. Nhưng lúc rửa bát thì ảnh bắt đầu khó chịu với mình và nói mình không biết thông cảm cho anh đi làm cả ngày mệt và tụi mình cãi nhau. Ảnh nói từ nay ảnh không qua ăn cơm là được nhưng suốt 1 năm qua ngày nào ảnh cũng qua ăn. Mình biết tiền không phải thước đo nhưng để làm ra tiền thì mình cũng phải mất công sức và trí tuệ nên với mình đó là tấm lòng của mình. Như vậy là mình chưa thông cảm cho ảnh phải không?

I&#x27;m on the asexual spectrum and basically never even been in a relationship and when I do date it&#x27;s usually other guys so I never know what to say and I don&#x27;t wanna just go pê đê 😂 also where I am from it&#x27;s completely normal to not be married at 30 most young people don&#x27;t even wanna get married at 40 these days. I tried to tell this Vietnamese lady I don&#x27;t want to get married and she gave me the weirdest look 😂 what&#x27;s a good reply to this kind of questions that won&#x27;t make everyone uncomfortable?

                              <span>I had a fun conversation with a Vietnamese friend regarding Vietnamese swears. We gone through most of everything. But they kept teasing me about this one word that they refuse to tell me for months, no matter how much I begged.
 They told me it’s so bad they will never teach it to me. It’s apparently a really old slang and you need to be local local to know, hard to find on Google as well, It’s just as bad if not worse than N-word with hard r. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY’RE REFERRING TO?
 Update: It&#x27;s an old slang for natives, it&#x27;s used for females specifically. &quot;Lẹo cái&quot; seems to be the closest one but it&#x27;s not complete. It&#x27;s a banned word on google, my friend&#x27;s only seen one text that had it written but it&#x27;s been banned since. And that this generation might not know it.

                              <span>I want to find a Vietnamese song I listen to during my childhood. If you could even point me towards the artist that would be really helpful. I listen to this song back in like 2009 so this song was either created in 2009 or even before. But in the song there was like 3 guy(don’t know if they were brothers or friends) but they were flirting with this one girl. I guess it’s kind of like a love song but more gear towards a younger audience. I remember in the music video the artist rode a bike 😂. Finally the 3 guys made a lot of songs together. Don’t know if they were individual artist working together or they were an actual music group that only made music together. Also it was a pretty common/popular group I believe.

                              <span>I thought about renting a bike in Ho Chi Minh and driving to Hanoi but I only have 3 weeks in Vietnam so instead I’ll get a sleeper train to Da Nang. I’m then planning to rent one there and drive up to Hanoi during 10 days. I know there are companies who do one-way rental for the Hai Van Pass but are there any that do the same until Hanoi?

                              <span>Chào các bác, sau khi đã tham khảo, tìm hiểu rất nhiều nguồn tin, bài viết trên mạng từ trong và ngoài nước thì đại đa số các bài viết đều nói chung về ý nghĩa tích cực của các loài hoa và rất hiếm nói về phần còn lại. Các bác có thể cho mình xin một số thông tin về các loài hoa mang ý nghĩa tiêu cực không ạ?

                              <span>Hello, I was watching a soccer game this evening, and I noticed something concerning. The commentator, who is also a host for this streaming service, had around 250k people watching live. In the chat section, a user named &quot;Bắn Hoả Tiễn&quot; said something inappropriate, and in response, the commentator displayed the message &quot;Bắn Hoả Tiễn is a dog&quot; on the screen for all 250k viewers to see. I&#x27;m wondering why some individuals still resort to comparing others to dogs as a means of humiliating those they dislike?

                              <span>Why would my Vn sister-in-law do this?
 And her behaviour is really pissing me off.
 SIL asked if I wanted Ca Phe Sua Da?
 &quot;Good idea&quot;.
 She buys 2 x Ca Phe Sua Da&#x27;s. 1 for me. 1 for her. 
 I did not offer to pay. She has good job by Vn standards. Maybe that was a mistake on my side?
 But be aware I am the main banker whenever any family get-togethers occur. I pay. And they ignore me. Situation normal.
 So it felt an improvement when member of family actually thinking about me!
 I liked my Ca Phe Sua Da so much I decide to buy another one.
 I ask my SIL if she would like another Ca Phe Sua Da?
 &quot;No&quot;.
 So I order 2 more Ca Phe Sua Da&#x27;s. 1 for me and 1 for BF of SIL. ( I&#x27;m thinking of others am I not? He had no idea).
 I ask my SIL how much did the Ca Phe Sua Da man charge?
 &quot;VND15k each. So VND30k&quot;.
 I give the guy VND30k. 
 This is where I was caught by surprise.......
 The Ca Phe Sua Da man obviously thought I had given him too much and went to put his hand in his pocket trying to say ( my Viet ain&#x27;t so hot) VND25k.
 I was surprised because SIL had been very clear I would need pay VND30k.
 The amount of money is not the issue.
 What is the issue is SIL then speaks to the guy in Tieng Viet and tells him &quot; Just take the VND30k. No need for change&quot;.
 She did not look at me. In fact she was looking away from me and the guy and at her mobile as if I would not hear and would not understand.
 He took his hand out of his pocket and tried to thank somebody and was not too sure who to look at; me or SIL. 
 So he kept his VND30k. 
 And why not! It was a very good Ca Phe Sua Da!
 The question I have is why SIL felt it necessary for foreign BIL to pay more than she did?
 Members of family frequently try to stiff me - i get the feeling they think I&#x27;m stoopid because I&#x27;m a foreigner and do not speak Tieng Viet and must therefore pay for them AND pay more.
 Hardly the behaviour of a loving family.
 What is driving this behaviour?

                              <span>I told this story once in r/Vozforum but they deleted it for no reason,
 My relationship with my mother is getting worse and worse everyday. She&#x27;s demanding that I give her half of my salary, my salary is only 6 mil. She said that she&#x27;s getting old and sick and as a child I have to give her my money,
 I refused, telling her at this age I need money for my goal and personal growth. And she kept guilt-tripping me telling she will get old and sick, I&#x27;m so fed up I told her that
 &quot;You kept telling me that you&#x27;re getting old and sick, but ever since the day you came back, what has you done for my health? Has you saved at least one penny in case my health would go bad?&quot;
 I should&#x27;ve moved out earlier, it&#x27;s just a part of me naively thinking that she and I could mend it back

                              <span>I&#x27;m living in Hanoi, having grown up in Bac Ninh. I heard that most people use &quot;Mày&quot;, and &quot;Tao&quot; to refer to their friends and themselves to their friends, as it&#x27;s an sign of being intimate and close and comfortable enough with them
 I personally don&#x27;t like those two pronouns and don&#x27;t use them much often, I think it could come out quite harsh some times, there&#x27;s a reason most people don&#x27;t use it with strangers. But there&#x27;re people in the North assume it&#x27;s the default way to call people no matter how close or distant you are, and I hate them so much, it sounds so rude if you and I aren&#x27;t that close
 With my best friends and friends, I use their personal names/tôi or tao if extremely close. Ông/Tôi and Personal names/Personal names. 
 The rare cases I use &quot;Mày&quot; and &quot;Tao&quot; with my friends are when I&#x27;m trying to make a comedy skit or purpousfully acting theatrically with them.

Mình không nghĩ là 2 năm cố gắng mà bây giờ cô ấy lại trở nên vậy , có cách nào giải quyết khiến kí ức hồi xưa trở về khiến cả 2 trân trọng nhau hơn không ạ?

                              <span>My 3rd time making phở gà. The top bowl has bean sprouts, jalapeños, lime, and green onions. I didn’t have a serving bowl large enough for all my noodles and broth so I just filled the red bowl up twice. I’m happy with how it tasted but trying to make the portions right is hard for me with the amount of broth/noodles for just 1 person. Anyway thanks for this dish Vietnam. Warm regards from Arizona, USA!

(Although this kind of topic will inevitably do that) I am a foreigner who has lived in Viet Nam for around 4 years and currently work as an English teacher at a language center.
 I have noticed that SOME of my teenage students seem to celebrate and venerate the Nazi regime and Hitler himself, with some of them showing me Nazi salutes in what I assume is &quot;humor&quot;, one student has played the Nazi anthem on his phone (I didn&#x27;t know what it was until he told me) and placed his hand on his heart, and some of my students have told me that they look up to him and have proudly told me things like &quot;I&#x27;m the biggest racist&quot;.

We&#x27;ve been in Bali for a week and last night we arrived in Da Nang (EDIT: sorry, we&#x27;re actually in Hoi An, we flew into Da Nang! Arrived very late, so I wasn&#x27;t sure!) and we&#x27;re here until Saturday. Haven&#x27;t had time to make too many plans yet.
 We love history, architecture, FOOD and wonderful people. 
 We don&#x27;t have a car, so will get taxis etc.
 Please help us make an itinerary.
 Thank you 💞

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I will be traveling to vietnam in march for 20 days. I want to prepare my itinerary in advance which means booking transportation. Which website is the best and most legit to book tickets (mostly train) and also allows to chose which berths i would like? Also; how much in advance should i book them? Any recommendation on where to rent a bike in da nang and ninh binh? Are peony cruises worth the price for an overnight &quot;cruise&quot;? 
 Thank you

                              <span>Me and my wife are planning a 10 day trip to Vietnam in the first 2 weeks on November 2023. We will be starting from Hanoi and then flying back from Ho Chi Minh.
 I have been reading inconclusive information about visiting Hoi An in November. Can anyone advise whether it would be wise to avoid visiting Hoi An during November or is it OK?
 Am so excited about this trip!

                              <span>Well, I was learning to drive a bike last year. Generally speaking, I was able to use it. But there was a strong fear that I could kill someone. And that fear paralysed me ultimately, so I have never driven outside parkings :)))) That’s why, generally speaking, I can’t use a bike. Plz recommend the instructor who knows how to work it out and can do that (and teach driving skills for sure :). 
 Humor (much humor) is a great tool that helped me, for example, overcome the same thing in surfing.
 Thanks.
 P.S. I have relevant driver license :D

                              <span>Hi Vietnamese,
 I am a Thai girl who is interested in living in Vietnam.
 The main reason is that I love Vpop and want to learn more about Vietnamese culture. I am obsessed with some big names: Son Tun Mtp, Low G, Quang Hung masterD, Amee, Tlinh, Hoang Thuy Linh,….
 Do you know Vpop is becoming more popular in Thailand? A Vietnamese guy introduced these songs to me ☺️
 There’re many reasons I want to explore Vietnam. Youth is too short to settle down.😎
 I know there is a big difference between north and south parts. My friend says HCM’s vibe is similar to Bangkok, so I choose Hanoi. I want something different. My friend will be in Hanoi soon, so he may help me a lot. And I have at least one person to hang out with
 My main concern is job hunting in Vietnam. I want to work in person with local people, so I can make friends.
 I am living in Montreal, Canada now. I studied abroad here and got a full time job, so I have work experience
 I have a degree in graphics design and diploma in photography. 
 How’s graphics design and photography industries in Vietnam? Any chance for me to get a job at a big studios or simply work as freelancer. I want to work for a professional one. I may send portfolio to potential employers.
 My other option is teaching. I took IELTS exam 2 months ago. My overall band is 7.5. Not bad, but not good enough to be English teacher.
 I have c2 in French and have lived in French speaking environment for a long time. I am thai, but my ancestors are Chinese and British, and I can speak some mandarin. I am thinking about being a French or Thai teacher.
 Do many local people want to learn French or Thai?
 Any suggestions to adapt environment in positive way, job hunting, housing and socializing?
 How do vietnamese think about Thai in general, esp female? I know some stereotypes exist
 I accidentally found this forum while googling “work in Vietnam”. Really want to get some insightful information from you guys.

                              <span>my parents were part of the boat refugees in ‘75 and i believe they both renounced their citizenship in order to get US naturalization. i was born in wisconsin but i would like to live in VN at some point and learn more about the language and culture. the us allows dual citizenship but i don’t know if the vn government does, nor if it would even be possible for me since my parents no longer are vn citizens. does anyone know if it’s possible in such cases to get citizenship (maybe after living or working there on a visa or something) or if it’s basically impossible?

                              <span>Hello I was born and raised in sweden and only know some conversational vietnamese as my family is mostly illiterate and couldn&#x27;t educate me... 
 So I&#x27;ve recently been looking up vietnamese Internet cultures and memes and whatnot and I found this video titled &quot;vinacon bị gank&quot; and I wondering if anyone could translate or give some context as to what happens in the video? And maybe give some recommendation of chill vietnamese content creators.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been wondering about this for a while now...it&#x27;s late 2023, covid will never be totally gone but much of the world has gotten vaccinated and moved on as the severity of the virus has decreased. 
 I don&#x27;t see too many folks on the streets masking these days, but for some reason it seems really common in high schools - I teach IELTS in high schools in Hanoi, and am surprised that sometimes up to half of my students are still masking. I wonder what the reason is - are they really doing it for health protocol? I can&#x27;t imagine teenagers are particularly worried about getting sick at this point right? Do their parents make them? My theory is that a lot of young people wear them because it helps self-conscious teens feel &quot;covered&quot; and secured a little bit. 
 I&#x27;m not an anti-masker, these guys can do what they want - just curious why it seems so much more prevalent than in other countries (to be clear, I&#x27;m talking about students in a classroom wearing it year-long, not wearing it on the road or because they&#x27;re sick.)

                              <span>So I admit that this probably annoys me more than most people but in Vietnam even when I travel by day I am in a sleeper bus.
 It&#x27;s kinda uncomfortable for me to do this. I like to sit up straight and look at the view outside. I don&#x27;t want to lie down during the day.
 Maybe I am going wrong by booking the bus through the hostel? Should i go to the local bus station instead and find a sitting bus?
 Edit: I&#x27;m an idiot and actually found out how to put the seat up now so this improves my mood dramatically lol

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m just beginning to develop my idea of tote bags (felt, canvas, structured and also casual shopping bags) after I got compliments and inquiries on where I got a special tote bag when I visited Vietnam this year.
 I wanted to do some market research to figure out what kind of designs appeal to the public - generally, Vietnamese-Americans and Vietnamese-Canadians but also anyone interested in a small fashion startup with a Vietnamese twist on it.
 Please let me know what sayings on the products would you be interested in most so I can focus on that design first.

 Like title says, looking to send a small (3-4 kg) package of clothes/souvenirs/… to EU, more specifically to Brussels, Belgium. 
 Any recommendations which service to use? I would hope to surely keep it below 2.000.000 VND, the duration of the shipping does not matter.
 UPS, FedEx seem to be very expensive, VN Post seems to be unreliable at times… 
 Not sure what to use. Any experiences: I’d love to hear them. TIA

                              <span>Hello I&#x27;m looking for a game where I can chat with other people. Since I moved to Vietnam, most MMOs (ff14, eso...) aren&#x27;t active in Vietnam&#x27;s evening time sadly, even when I have switched to oceania server...
 Need to scratch my multiplayer game itch

                              <span>I heard those who get long term visa nomad and expat in Vietnam, having a cheap and good lifestyle. I spend a lot in the country currently I live, how would you say Vietnam life is like? Are most foreigners there to save money and live very cheap or is the quality of life really good?

                              <span>My wifes family thinks that it is very risky to walk alone through less populated areas close to Hanoi, say 10km south of the inner city between those smalls villages. 
 They say the risk is that you get knocked out and then sold to the chinese(??) is that an actual risk? Are there real risks? Is it more or less dangerous as a foreigner?
 I&#x27;m asking because I like to take long walks through nature. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello kind folks! My partner and I are in Hanoi, planning to leave for Sapa soon. There&#x27;s tons of packages at the hostel advertising trekking and homestay packages for $150 Canadian and they include accommodation, food, and sleeper bus to and from Sapa to Hanoi.
 The only problem is every single one I&#x27;ve seen advertised has 12km+ daily hikes. As much as I&#x27;d love to do this, I have a bad hip from past surgery and I think my max would be 5km a day. I don&#x27;t wanna slow the groups down with my frequent rests or end up in a pain crisis in front of others.
 Has anyone heard of some good packages with less hiking for the old and sore travellers like me? Perhaps slow or partial hikes, or rides to villages 😅
 Or should we just buy our own bus to Sapa, find a hostel, and do our own day tours? Any advice? 
 Thank you!!

                              <span>Tôi là Tèo ( biệt danh thôi 😂 ) năm nay 22 tuổi. Cách đây 3 năm, tôi có 1 mối tình khá đẹp cho đến khi tôi bị cắm sừng và rồi tôi đã trả thù người yêu cũ khiến gia đình cô ta tan vỡ. Tôi sẽ gọi nyc là H. Tôi từng rất yêu và trân trọng H ngay cả khi tôi biết bản thân mình bị phản bộ, tôi cũng chỉ chấp nhận trong im lặng. Nhưng đáp lại sự tôn trọng cuối cùng đó cô ta lại lấy tôi ra để làm trò tiêu khiển bên tên khốn kia. Rồi sau vài lần nói chuyện không thể kết thúc tôi đã gửi những bằng chứng về việc bố H ngoại tình cho mẹ H và mẹ cô ta làm ầm lên rồi li hôn. Chưa cảm thấy thỏa mãn, tôi lại khiến bố cô ta bị bắt vì tội tổ chức đánh bạc và phải ngồi tù 4 năm. Sau 1 năm chia tay, tôi nghe được tin từ vài người bạn chung của 2 đứa về việc cuộc sống cô ta khá tồi tệ khi mà bố đang phải thụ án, mẹ nuôi 2 đứa em và cô ta thì cũng khá tệ. Tôi đã không cảm thấy bất kì điều gì khi tôi nghe những điều đó. 
 Đây là câu chuyện thật của bản thân mình nhưng chỉ là vắn tắt, nếu mọi người muốn nghe đầy đủ &quot;từ tình yêu ngọt ngào đến sự trả thù không hề thương xót&quot; hãy cmt cho mình biết.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just moved to Hanoi for a month or 2. After I basically settled down all my things, I&#x27;m starting to explore the city&#x27;s places. I&#x27;ve tried going on walking streets in Ho Guom, and it&#x27;s not really my thing, plus I&#x27;m just going alone, so that just feels awkward. Can you guys suggest some places for me to go, and maybe make some new friends? Any suggestion is appreciated, thank you.

                              <span>Yesterday, I took my first Ielts exam, and it wasn’t going well, I mean I did prepare for it but it was quite hard. In the writing test, I completely rushed in time. The first task is about 4 pie charts, which took me 25 minutes to finish. The second one is “Some people think that good health is very important to every person, so medical service should not be run by profit-making companies. Do the advantages of private health care outweigh the disadvantages?” I was stunned after reading it, but I still tried my best to complete the essay. When it was done, I counted the words and found out that I wrote just only 200 words, while the task requires to write at least 250 words. But I didn’t have time to add more or look over it, I had to handle it because time was up. I feel really bad now. I think I will only get 5 in writing and my parents will kill me, as I just threw their money out the window.

                              <span>My new Vietnamese girlfriend calls me &quot;Bo&quot;. I know that it means daddy/father. We are both in our 30&#x27;s and she is only 2 years younger than me. She said this is common in Vietnam. Is it really common? If so, why? Any other meaning to it?
 EDIT: She is 100% Vietnamese and born and raised in HCMC. I asked her what Bo means and she said &quot;daddy/father&quot;. She often sends me this text: Dạ bố.

 The medicine I want to buy is diabetes medicine. I want to buy Metformin and Dapagliflozin. 
 Can I get Mounjaro or Ozempic, an injection-type diabetes treatment other than oral medicine, at a pharmacy without a prescription? 
 How much does it usually cost?

                              <span>I am going to Vietnam for a month, travelling around the country. I am very excited and lokking forward to it! However, I have read that people (some?) eat dog/cat. I live in a culture where dogs/cats are pets, and I have a cat myself. I know and agree that there is not a moral difference between eating cat and for instance pig or cow, but being a cat owner (and vegetarian) I know it would be very difficult to see dog/cat meat consumption. I therefore want to avoid seeing it or being reminded of it as much as I can.
 I do not know how widespread it is, so I was hoping you could tell me if there are certain areas in Vietnam, places or situations I should avoid when travelling to avoid seeing it? Does anyone have any tips for a sensitive soul?

                              <span>hi everyone, i&#x27;ll be traveling from america to hcmc soon and would like to know your favorite places to buy skincare and makeup products (especially japanese and korean brand ones) in hcmc?
 in addition, are these products generally affordable (for an american tourist)? i ask because asian beauty products are usually pretty marked up over here.
 thanks in advance!

Because the tour groups are all full for tomorrow. And weekend will be crowded. So I want to avoid the crowd. Also, is the public bus AC - air conditioner ? Else I will just sweat n die in the heat. Thanks.

Nhưng hiện tại mình cảm giác không hợp với bạn đó thì mình nên nói thẳng ra với họ hay là cứ im lặng rồi xủi mất đây mọi người. Mình đang không biết làm cách nào cho cả 2 đỡ khó xử nhất có thể.

                              <span>Hello,
 My group is arriving in SGN and we are hoping to book a bus to Can Tho. Problem is, I was hoping we can get a bus that pick us up directly from the airport and also drop us off at a specific spot - would that be possible? 
 I&#x27;m looking on 12go but the pick up spot are all bus stations that are an hour walk from the airport. Please suggest any website or company, and any other advice. Thank you!

                              <span>Vietnamese lived in America here. I moved to the US 10 years ago and are on track to become a mental health therapist. It’s a job I really enjoyed as it let me help people but I spontaneously remember about Vietnam and want to ask some questions about my home town. Since my old friend group drifted away and those I’m still in contact with also moved to other countries. Would anyone mind tell me how the field of Mental Health is doing in Vietnam? Any progress for on it? Do you guys still face a lot of issues?

 19 and soon-to-be 20 yr old vnmese. Got sent to Canada since 14th and I hated myself ever since. 
 So back in grade 8th or 2017 my mom was rambling about studying abroad or relocating abroad, ofc me being a stupid 8th grade kid knew nothing. Fast forward to grade 9th and she just randomly said &quot;oh yea ur going abroad next year&quot;, again being a dumb 9th grader who knows nothing more than video games i was happy that i get to be away from my parents. It wasnt really my choice and i had no control over me going abroad but as a dumb kid i found that was to be extremely exciting. 
 Well throughout the years from grade 10th highschool to even 2nd year college I suffered from many states of depression. Language barrier wasnt really a …</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone. As a newcomer to Hanoi I have recently discovered that Taxis are impossible to get when its raining and I have been unable to get to work this morning. Can someone please explain to me, like I am a child, how to use the bus service in Hanoi? What i&#x27;m looking for are things like: Do I need to wave at the bus driver to stop or do they stop at every bus stop? Is there a button to press to tell the bus driver that I am getting off? Is every one way ticket the same price or does the price change depending on distance? Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I speak no Vietnamese other than hello and thank you.

                              <span>Em nghĩ là vì ngành này hot cũng một thời gian khá lâu nên sẽ có nhiều anh chị trên đây có trải nghiệm ngành, em đang năm nhất, em đang có định hướng trở thành một chuyên gia bảo mật và em vừa học xong C cơ bản, em đang phân vân không biết mình nên học gì tiếp và cái lộ trình để có đủ kiến thức làm việc trong ngành là gì, và cho em hỏi entry level job trong lĩnh vực này có nhiều không ạ, tại em thấy hầu như người ta toàn tuyển fresher dev.
 Em cảm ơn ạ.

                              <span>Strange question. I&#x27;ve been to VN four times. Have a foodie friend traveling through Asia who wanted to visit for a few days and asked me for recommendations. They will be working remote every day but will need to give some live presentations so a strong reliable wifi signal is important. 
 On the flip side, I wanted to recommend a place where they could also walk to local places for food. Originally I wanted to recommend Hoi An for the experience, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust the wifi enough (at least not at the bandwidth they&#x27;d need). Maybe Da Nang but the hotels that I&#x27;d assume would have the best wifi are not near areas that are very walkable and are very touristy. They could visit Hoi An for a half day trip though. Then I was thinking Nha Trang - I remember staying near the water in a modern hotel and could walk down narrow streets to some hidden gems though it was pretty touristy. That was pre-pandemic, maybe they got pushed out...not sure.
 Open to other suggestions (and I&#x27;ll probably add them to my own itinerary next trip)!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ll be travelling solo through Cambodia and Vietnam. I was wondering if there are any group tours that operate day tours that I could join and socialise with other travellers.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I will stay for work in Vietnam (Northside of Ho-Chi-Minh-City),. I decided to add vacation after the business trip and stay a week in Vietnam.
 I never have been in an Asia country. Do you have any recommendations around Ho-Chi-Minh-City like jungle, beach and sightseeing? Which district is a good one for tourists?
 Is it easy to move by train or bus to my destinations or is it better to get a taxi/Uber (what will they charge)?!

                              <span>Ideally looking for the change in heights and weights for both males and females over time. I would be grateful if source is from Vietnam or conducted by Vietnamese scholars. 
 Also, other than statistics, has height increased dramatically since Vietnam has started to grow economically? To a level where it is noticeable? 
 This is for part of an economic growth study for school! Thanks!

                              <span>So, this morning I woke up and saw the news about how the concert tickets is so poorly sold is all over the place. Almost every entertainment Facebook pages, from big to small, is running this news. 
 What seems questionable to me is they&#x27;re trying to confuse people between &quot;not selling&quot; and &quot;not sold out&quot;. I assume a concert ticket not sold out after 3 days is pretty normal, but it seems they&#x27;re making it looks like not a sinlge ticket is sold and it&#x27;s the worst show ever. 
 As I don&#x27;t really care much about Vbiz, what exactly happened? Is she really that bad or just she provoked some hidden big media company?

                              <span>I&#x27;m Vietnamese and planning to go under some courses to become a tour guide. It&#x27;s the most suitable career path I could think of right now for myself, for my future. 
 I&#x27;m currently living in Hanoi, which I think is quite convenient, because I feel that tourism is our strength and is quite developed here. I mean, we have the Old Quarters and Ha Long Bay and other fascinating and breath-taking places in all the provinces close and nearby Hanoi. I&#x27;ve always thought that I&#x27;m in the best place in Vietnam if I want to persue tourism as a career path.
 But my heart and soul all lie in Sai Gon. I love Saigon and the fact it&#x27;s more gay-friendly. I&#x27;m gay and have no friends in Hanoi, I mean I do have but in Saigon I have more of my people. I want to join them, be with them, and support each other. Unlike here in Hanoi, all alone. The only thing stopping me from having moved to Saigon a long time ago is the fact that I still think Hanoi is better for persuing Tourism. I&#x27;m currently not on any career path, and I&#x27;m 23 now, It&#x27;s my career, not my social life, that I should pay attention to.
 But I love Saigon, I just don&#x27;t know how the whole tourism is for Saigon. Do I have much chances to grow with tourism, as much as I think I have in Hanoi?

He dressed, ate, and lived like an average farmer, he treated everyone as an equal and he also wanted to be treated as an equal by us as well. So why are we treating him like he&#x27;s the God Emperor from 40k. For example, we preserve his corpse in something that is almost like a temple. And yet teachers, parents and practically everyone that i talk to compares him to a god. I&#x27;m not hating on him, I appreciate his efforts in freeing this country. But I&#x27;m confused on why we are treating in the exact opposite way that he wanted to be treated.

                              <span>American here.
 When visiting to my local barnes and noble recently it was obvious from first glance that a lot of media from Asia is popular. My bookstore shelves are stocked to the brim with Japanese, Korean, even Chinese comics and light novels, figurines, the works. Korean and Japanese pop stars fill the music section, easily holding their own against big western pop stars like Gaga and Bieber.
 But aside from some novels in the young adult section of my bookstore written by Vietnamese Americans, or the usual biographies in the history section discussing the war. There&#x27;s not a lot of pop culture made by Vietnamese that&#x27;s popular in the western market as other asian countries. Not a lot of fantasy or horror novels, not a lot of manga, not even the odd pop star. 
 You&#x27;d think with how much has changed in US-Vietnam relations since the war we&#x27;d be seeing more Vietnamese pop culture get exported over here. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Why is that?
 And it&#x27;s not like Americans are biased against Vietnamese culture because of the war or years of action movies. Far from it. Vietnamese Food is very popular in places like Los Angeles and Toronto, but vietnamese pop culture seems to have fallen completely by the wayside.
 So I&#x27;m here to ask for theories on why Vietnamese media isn&#x27;t as big of a thing in the west as the other nations cultures. And also to ask for recommendations on vietnamese books, movies, tv, manga etc. that I might be interested in?

                              <span>Greetings,
 This is my first post on Reddit community. I’m a fourth year student in university of science and I am also a software engineer but my salary is not good. Yeah I don’t have a lot of money to subcribe lessons to learn the English. My idea is that I will post a story every day. Hopefully you can help me to improve my English.
 Many thanks, Luan.

                              <span>I have been a vegetarian for many years and always enjoy learning about new vegetarian dishes through travel. I visited Vietnam in early September this year and visited Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Da Nang. I will introduce to you some vegetarian dishes that I find strange and delicious for longtime vegetarians like me when traveling:
 1. Veganterian Pho 
 Pho
 Pho is a famous dish in Vietnam and I was quite surprised that this dish has a vegetarian version. I found Pho Chay Nhu restaurant, I will put the Google Map link here: https://goo.gl/maps/u1g84gj5PxVoZ5rS9 so you can easily find it. The restaurant is highly rated on Google, so I stopped by. This vegetarian Pho dish is very frugal because the broth is made entirely from vegetables. The toppings of this dish include tofu, mushrooms, …</span>

                              <span>So i just finished the talking with her family and results were this : I got the call at 7am my time and first i had to ask her if she set me up and her answer was this : Yes I did, i already knew that you were going to marry me i just speed up the process because i don&#x27;t want to waste more time. She jokingly said that i needed to grow a pair of balls. Back with the talk with her parents their idea we agreed that we are going to get married on paper in home country because she will get my passport. So she will be coming next month so we can do the formalities. I would love to do it in a church but thats just not possible. Second talking point was where are we going to live. I told them about my plans but i was immediately shut down. They told me that it&#x27;s better to live the first 2 3 years of the childs life near them, the reasoning here is they want to be involved in the upbringing a little bit and because it&#x27;s their first grandchild. After that they dropped the bomb that they want us to move to Singapore after those 2 3 years. Reasoning for this are plenty but I&#x27;ll list some important ones : they are opening some offices there and they need someone to manage it and my wife is the candidate, better opportunity and it&#x27;s not far away from home. I didn&#x27;t expected this but I call them after i had some time thinking about it. Third was their question of when i will be moving. Told them that if she comes in a month I&#x27;ll need about 4 months to move. Because it takes some time to move your life. Fourth was the naming. Told them that she and me have an agreement that&#x27;s if it&#x27;s boy I&#x27;m naming it and if it&#x27;s a girl she is naming it. My reason here is make continues male and female continues female.

                              <span>I have to go on a business trip to Vietnam with my team of five employees. The Vietnamese company has asked us for a $1,000 &quot;introduction fee,&quot; which appears to be a form of bribery. I&#x27;m concerned and wondering if this is common practice in Vietnam. Should I comply and give them the fee? 
 I have previous experience doing business with Chinese companies, and fortunately, I didn&#x27;t encounter such situations. This is the first time I&#x27;ve come across this issue during my business endeavours. 
 I want to hear your advice. What should I do? Should I give them the fee?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I was reading and it said one of the allowed people is “weak muscles” which I assume means elderly and woman.
  
Who is allowed to use pepper spray? The law only allows certain objects to be equipped with supporting tools, including pepper spray. Accordingly, in Clause 1, Article 55 of the Law on Management and Use of Weapons, Explosives and Support Tools 2017 stipulates that subjects equipped with combat gears include:
  
 
National Army;
 
Militia and self-defense;
 
Coast Guard;
 
Police;
 
Weak muscles;

 Any insight?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I’m going on a trip in the next few weeks to Indonesia for a month to dive and then heading to Vietnam for a month to travel (planning north to south) I don’t really want to carry my dive gear around with me for the whole month. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on shipping my luggage home or if it would be cheaper to rent a locker in Hanoi and leave it there while I go down south and then fly back up to Hanoi from Ho Chi Minh and fly home from Hanoi? Online it says that shipping a suitcase from Hanoi to the US would be like $400, does that sound about right? Thank you for your help!! :)

                              <span>We are traveling to Hanoi on Thursday but couldn’t get any VND without preordering it before last weekend. We read in a few posts that you can exchange it in gold shops, however in most posts they were only talking about USD. Does anyone have experience with exchanging less popular currencies like the SEK? I (from a euro country with a bank account in euros) can withdraw from an ATM without any fees, my partner however would have to pay rather high fees so we are trying to avoid that (he cannot simply transfer to me, it is a really complicated process for him to transfer within Europe with his bank). So we were thinking of simply bringing some Swedish Leonor and exchanging it in Vietnam.
 Edit: my autocorrect changed kronor in the title to Ironie, that wasn’t my intention 😂. It seems however that I cannot edit the title anymore

                              <span>Hoping to ride the Ha Giang Loop with my wife and friend over Christmas. I have been researching the documentation needed and the results are nebulous. I have an American drivers license with motorcycle endorsement M1. So does my wife. My friend only has a drivers license, no motorcycle endorsement.
 This is what is states on: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Vietnam.html
 Because the United States is not a party to the Convention on Road Traffic, international driving permits and U.S. drivers’ licenses are not valid in Vietnam. Foreigners renting vehicles risk fines, prosecution, and/or imprisonment for driving without a Vietnamese license endorsed for the appropriate vehicle. If you wish to drive in Vietnam, contact the Provincial Public Transportation Service of the Vietnamese Department of Communications and Transport to obtain a Vietnamese driver’s license. Note that you may be required to take a medical examination as part of the driver license application process. 
 Can I get away with a International Driving Permit on the Ha Gaing Loop while remaining legal?
 Otherwise, what do I need to get? I would like to avoid bribing government officials.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Vietnamese myself, but I&#x27;m always scared shitless whenever I go out on the streets and saw parents let their kids sit in the front and drive with high speed. 
 It&#x27;s getting close to Mid-autumn festival now, so more and more parents takes their childrens out to have fun and buy them toys. I live near Hàng Mã street and I saw all kind of parents letting their kids standing up in the seat holding toys and latterns, it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re telling their children to have some practice before some circus show. It&#x27;s even scarier sometimes when I saw them carelessly speed up to pass some red lights 
 Childrens that young, if gotten in an accident and hit their head, certainly it&#x27;s going to be fatal, but it&#x27;s actually very rare to see any kids with helmets on

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know about y&#x27;all, I absolutely am annoyed with this kind of disturbance. There is clearly zero necessity for such loud noises for a motorbike to function normally. Those people are narcissistic, egoistic, uneducated individuals who think what they&#x27;re doing is cool, and they&#x27;re purposely doing it to grab other people&#x27;s attention (lack of attention much?). They also ride with super fast speed in sub-urban areas too, which is dangerous for the public&#x27;s safety where many children or elders are on the streets. Most of them are gangster-wannabe guys in their 20s or early 30s. It seems like authorities don&#x27;t do anything to seriously put an end to this, unless in popular, large streets.

                              <span>As the title suggest, why is there so few media and general public awareness about Vietnam&#x27;s intervention during the Khmer Rouge genocidal regime? I will admit I am not a history honor student, but I do remember that there was barely anything about this in the (Vietnamese) history text book. I know the political situation at the time was extremely complex, with all the communist allies infighting, fallout from the end of the Vietnam war and general fear of the Soviets at the time. But the fact that Vietnam pushed all the way to the capital of Cambodia to overthrow one of the most brutal regime in human history, all the while facing pressure not only from the Pro-Chinese countries, but also from the Western Democratic world, is one hell of a tale. Why is it so often forgotten? Link of you want to read about it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War.

 I noticed that a lot of them are trying to discredit Vietnam. It seems like a lot of Chinese see the alliance between the US and Vietnam as a threat

                              <span>Hi, my name is Xueru and I&#x27;m from China, but I&#x27;m not ethnically Chinese. My parents are from Taiwan and Vietnam. I have a different name when I live in Vietnam, which is Khanh Huyen. The story I am sharing here happened in 2018, when I first visited Vietnam. I don&#x27;t know how to say it in a way that you guys can understand, but in order to use Reddit, we have to use a VPN, and we nicknamed it &quot;Vietnamese Pho Noodle&quot;. And that&#x27;s right, the reason I wanted to come to Vietnam was because I wanted to try pho.
 After arriving in Hanoi, it was already late, so we decided to leave the sightseeing for the next morning. The next morning, my parents went to do the paperwork for me because we also intend to live in Vietnam. So my mom gave me &quot;500,000 VND&quot; (It was around 150 yuan) to go out and eat wha…</span>

                              <span>She is 23 me also. 
 The story goes like this, for our 4th anniversary we went to Thailand and one night we both got really drunk really drunk and she told me it&#x27;s OK to finish inside. As a monkey i got really excited and did it without thinking of the consequences. Month and half later i get a call with a positive test. I literally froze and the only thing i can think about is getting my shit together. I would like to point out that i don&#x27;t have a look on this situation as my life is over it&#x27;s just a natural progression of life that may happened a little earlier. She told me that she hasn&#x27;t told her parents yet because she wanted to tell me first. We had a serious talk about further progression and when will I move. After the call I immediately talked with my parents because it&#x27;s a serious shift in my life dynamic and because i need to prepare the funds for the move. The mindset of our parents was already pushing us to get married so we don&#x27;t have to worry about family disapproval. The only problem here is the sudden switch in our lives. 
 So i have a couple of questions: What&#x27;s the price of land in Hanoi? Planning on building a house Dual citizenship is it possible for all countries? Asking for the kid Is 5 years maximum for visa exemption? How much will I be paying in taxes? 
 If you have some questions for me ask me in the comment

                              <span>We spent 2 nights in HCMC and not once did a driver try and offer to be our personal driver and exchange contact details.
 We&#x27;ve been in Da Nang half a day now and every single driver has asked us whether they can drive us back to the hotel and offer to hang around wherever we are so that we can use them over Grab.
 Is this expected or some sort of scam? Every time we say Grab has been perfect for us and I&#x27;ve never waited for more than 2 minutes so it&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t trust them but rather I don&#x27;t want to waste their time waiting around for us.
 Writing this as I sit in a Grab whilst the driver is trying to tell us what our plans are coming back tonight on Google Translate.

                              <span>I (24M) am currently in a relationship with my girlfriend (23F). We&#x27;re planning to get married in about 2-3 years once our financial situations improve. Recently, I was chatting with my dad about life in general, and the topic of having kids came up. Personally, I&#x27;m not too concerned about having children. I know I could be a great dad, but I&#x27;d also be perfectly fine without kids. My girlfriend has also hinted that she doesn&#x27;t want children, and I didn&#x27;t push the conversation further because either outcome is okay with me.
 When I shared this with my dad, he didn&#x27;t react well. In fact, he called both of us crazy and said we weren&#x27;t in our right minds. No matter how much I tried to explain our decision, he kept insisting that I&#x27;d change my mind eventually. This really upset me because he wasn&#x27;t respecting our choice and was trying to influence it.
 I can already see this topic coming up again in the future, and I don&#x27;t know how to get through to him. I understand that he&#x27;s getting older and wants grandchildren, which makes it tough because I know how much it would hurt him not to have his own. My older brother is also uncertain about his stance on kids. Any advice on how to handle this?

                              <span>Hi people,
 I&#x27;m Vietnamese Canadian and I have a sweet viet gf. She&#x27;s little older than me, but calls me &quot;em.&quot; often. She rarely or never calls me &quot;anh.&quot; I think it&#x27;s weird but I&#x27;m use to it now...
 I call her &quot;em&quot; or &quot;đai ca&quot; in Vietnamese. Or &quot;baby&quot; or &quot;boo.&quot; in English. 
 Is there a word to call your gf or wife if little older than you? She&#x27;s 3 years older than me, but I love her dearly as there is no age difference.

 The experiences that I take back home are something I’ll cherish for life. I have to be honest, I knew very little about the history of vietnam- but as I met people and visited war museum I learned so much. You guys are absolutely amazing, such hardworking, humble, helpful &amp; ambitious people. I am so inspired by you! 🇻🇳
 Special shoutout to all the women in Vietnam, you gave me food at 2AM, helped me with directions &amp; assisted me in heavy rains when my scooter broke down.
 Cảm ơn!

                              <span>Hello,
 We are 2 adults visiting Vietnam this December. We both are foodies and always love to try local cuisine.
 What are some of the local favorite places that we should not miss? We mostly prefer street food or small restaurants but can also visit upscale ones if it is worth it. We also like to try vegetarian food so please recommend if you know any good local vegetarian restaurants. 
 I know that this is a subjective question. But I am trying to see what kind of suggestions I get so I can make the best decision and cover some good spots within the few days we are in Hanoi. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello, my partner and I are planning to deliver our baby in Vietnam. We have dual citizenships for both the USA and Vietnam and are planning for the baby to keep both citizenship as well.
 Has anyone done CRBA? How was the experience? Due date is around Christmas. We&#x27;re planning to come back to the US mid March. Would it be enough time for the CRBA to process and issue a newborn passport?
 TIA

                              <span>I gave money to my Vietnamese wife to buy and invested a land property in Vietnam as foreigners are not allowed to buy land property. The pink book is in my wife&#x27;s name. When she was registering the land for the pink book, they require my consent and signature to complete the purchase. I neeeded a translator to translate the document and signed the form. That was for purchase and my question is if my wife sells the property - Does she need my consent as well to sell the land property?

There were a group of young guys breakdancing there. One of them was a young vietnamese man with a blach t-shirt and brown pants. He was really handsome and danced really nice. I was wondering if anyone here could help me find him, I would like to ask him out on a date.

 Please give me some tips. I am worried not to get into scam. Worried of falling sick alone in the country. The bana hills look too much crowded to me. Shall I skip it ? What is there to see except the bridge? Between hoi An and danang, where should I book hotel ? Also, is it a good idea to get a bus /train from Saigon to da nang or better to book flight ?

                              <span>Hi, I’m (F21) Vietnamese American and just got back from traveling to Vietnam for a week. I stayed in one hotel the whole trip and ended up getting along really well with the staff. We were all similar age, and I was so happy to become friends with some locals. 
 Yesterday, before I left and checked out of my hotel room, the staff asked if they could take a picture with me to keep as a memory. Since I was in a rush, I forgot to ask them for their contact info/social media and if they could send the picture to me. Now I’m really really regretting it and am sad I won’t be able stay in touch with them or remember their faces in the future…
 Do you think there is any way to reach out to the staff? Should I contact the hotel? Or would that be weird and I should just let it be?

                              <span>Will be traveling to Vietnam soon and part of my trip involves going from HCMC to Can Tho (one way). I&#x27;m hoping to hire a taxi. I looked into grab and it&#x27;s showing about 2000000 dong one way, which is cheaper than what my hotel is quoting me. Can I really just hire a grab for this trip? 
 I know there are cheaper ways (sleeper bus, moped) but I would prefer taxi and possibly making one stop along the way.

                              <span>We thoroughly enjoyed the natural beauty, but unfortunately, the city proved to be a tourist hotspot with limited attractions. The locals were notably less friendly compared to our previous experiences in Vietnam. Additionally, it was disheartening to witness young children, aged 3 to 5, selling souvenirs to tourists on the streets. Would not recommend!

 Her name is Xuan. Any tips on how to say this from an English speaking perspective?

                              <span>Hello everyone I am planning on a 3 night, 4 day guided self driving tour around the ha giang loop. I am wondering where travellers put their backpacks? Since the tour stops off at multiple hostels/home stays, do we have to carry our 50-70L backpacks with us on the bikes? 
 Also any recommendation of a hostel to book it with would be greatly appreciated, I am currently leaning towards centra backpackers Hano
 Many thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been close to this vietnamese woman. I&#x27;m 30 she&#x27;s 31. She&#x27;s in a term contract in my laboratory for 1 year. I am an introvert, so does she, and both of us have been single forever. I talk way less than her, and she always talk nonstop with me but not with others. Initially she seems couldn&#x27;t fit in with my other lab members because language barrier, so I tried to setup a trip with international students in our lab to make her comfortable. We ended up going to a lot of trips, but lately it was just only the both of us and mostly it was her idea. 
 We got busier and ended up often having dinner together. From then on I had a crush on her and one day I confess. I was rejected because she want to focus on work and family first, but also because we won&#x27;t be able to meet for that long and she doesn&#x27;t want to have a heartbreak from breakup. Strangely, we became even closer than before. Now only a few weeks before she go back to her old lab in another country, she wants me to spend the last day with her and wants to stay together with me and share a room. I am also from SEA, and I don&#x27;t think this is quite normal, as in sharing a room but not a couple. But she said it is normal in vietnam. Is this true? If you&#x27;re also a woman, I would like to know what do you think of this.
 Edit: Thank you for the replies. I tried to reply, but because this is a new account, the bot wouldn&#x27;t let me unless allowed by the actual mods. I don&#x27;t want to inconvenience the mods each time I want to reply. I am not sure about using my main account. But still, thank you.

                              <span>so i&#x27;m a hs student, việt kiều, but i went to live with family in saigon in the summer. since then we&#x27;ve been considering my transferring to an international school there, but it would only be for my final year of hs. we found one that parallels my current education seemingly perfectly; it has the program i&#x27;m in and provides the same diploma and even (supposedly) has the same standards as my current school board. nothing has been worked out or confirmed yet but i just had a few questions. 
 if anyone has been to or heard about both international schools in saigon and hs in north america, how do they compare in terms of education standards? would it be a difficult switch? what is the general student demographic - are there a lot of việt kiều or foreigners? what&#x27;s the student social life/culture like?
 edit: the specific school in mind is CIS (Canadian International School) but at this point we&#x27;ll still consider other options.

                              <span>Today was super busy and there was surprisingly a lot of people joining to draw (at least more than last week i think). This time I get to sit in a garden and it was twice more comfortable to draw than last week in which I had to sit next to a trash can and a sewer.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to know from the locals of VN if you believe pet owners are vaccinating their pets. Such as, are owners more educated about the seriousness of rabies and are spending the money and taking the extra precautions to protect themselves from rabies and strangers from possible harm of rabies infections from their pets? Is vaccinating something you hear being discussed by friends, family or neighbors?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Our family is traveling to Viet Nam at the end of December &amp; we’re wondering for a place to stay for a month. Since we have a baby and ,so looking more like a house or apartment which has 2-3 rooms. Our budget is around $300-400 in Saigon,preferably in Dist 1,3,5 or 6 as we have a relatives nearby those districts. What are your recommendations? Does airbnb work in VN? What are your experiences? TIA.

                              <span>Hey all, I’ll be travelling to Vietnam Sept 20-Oct 19. Haven’t been to Vietnam for 20+yrs.
 I plan to do touristy things and travel all over Vietnam from South-Central-North amongst other fun things.
 I plan to be in Hoi An for the Lantern festival and Da Nang in the end of September to early October; Hanoi-HaLong-NinhBinh around mid October. Otherwise, I’ll be situated in HCM D1.
 How bad is the rainy season? Will the rainy season be so bad that I end up being indoors majority of the travels? 
 Any advice or travel tips are much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, I’m 29F from Philippines and I am seeing this 30M Vietnamese for quite some time now. We are both professional and worked in the same industry. We are getting to know each other and our relationship is good so far. I’ve been to Vietnam few times already and also tried to stay for few weeks. I really like the food and the people, btw :) and he also visited my country. But the only problem is he cannot see the relationship to progress or lead to marriage because I’m from a different country, culture differences and he is thinking how will his family reacts to our relationship etc. Well, on my end there will be no issues as I think Filipino families are more open to this kind of setup. 
 I know for sure that I don’t want to get married, (in near future at least) but of course we also respect and don’t want to waste each other’s time. I do like him and willing to make this relationship to work.
 I just want to ask some insights about this kind or relationship, is it not common or hard to accept in Vietnam? Should I give up? 
 I really appreciate your time reading this. Please be kind in the comment section :)

                              <span>My husband and I have lived here for almost five years and regularly eat street food, so have pretty strong stomachs. However, sometimes we are bested by bad banh mi or xoi. When it (occasionally) strikes I just want loperamide or a similar drug so we can get on with our teaching. But the pharmacists always give me this? What is it actually? 
 I have basic Vietnamese, like ordering food or instructing kids what to do, but no idea when it comes to medical stuff.

 For just a few million Vnd more you can get the same style bike (Semi auto underbone) whether it&#x27;s a Honda Wave or Yamaha Sirius.
 Are the Facebook sellers being greedy or is it to do with the &quot;retro&quot; look?

                              <span>In the last hour today I feel I lived in a real life miracle. I was passenger on a motorbike, wife was driving, I dropped my wallet that was in my pants pocket. All my Id are in there, bank cards, the card key for the apartments we are living in. So we try the impossible, going back and forth, looking for my wallet dropped in the street. Phan Xich Long street is crowded, can’t drive back in the same lane, everything seems desperate and futile. We end up driving back till the barber shop I just been before losing the wallet. They went trough a lot of effort helping us, showing us security camera footage of the last hour to check if by any chance I dropped my wallet there. Seem there is nothing more we can do. Suddenly my wife receive a phone call. It was one guy working as security in the street. Thanks to the house card key he found in the wallet he was able to trace back the phone number of my wife. He even makes sure to my wife to show up with me, to avoid a possible landlord to retrieve easy money. Such a thoughtful move. There was my wallet, money untouched. I gave him all I had in the wallet, 2 million dong, and he right away split equally with his partner. I’m happy that this small luck ended up in the hands people in the security, among all others.
 I know how much I was lucky, but still nobody can talk me out of thinking that this could have happen only in this Country. Kudos to all the good people of Vietnam. 🫰

 I (European 35 M) live in Vietnam and work for a Vietnamese company in Vietnam. My company pays tax on my income. However I invest with a European broker in ETF&#x27;s. This is not taxed in Europe because I dont live there. I thought I also dont have to pay tax in Vietnam, but I&#x27;m not sure?

                              <span>I am an amateur bowler, and Bowling is not a popular sport in Vietnam. The funding for Bowling is garbage compared to other sports, and it is why professional bowlers have a hard time locating a good bowling alley for leagues in Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Personally, a good bowling alley must be facilitated with professional-grade equipment (pin setters, scoring system, standard size lanes, balls,...) along with good food/beverage services while being affordable for the young folks. Granted, there may be dozens of bowling alleys popping up on Google, but many of them either lack the qualities mentioned above OR they are closed... permanently. 
 In the past year, I have been to many bowling alleys, and I have come up with a curated list of the goats. I have also ranked them, with the top one being…</span>

                              <span>As I stated in an earlier post I am traveling the country with a good friend of mine, we have had a great time so for, even though there were some things to figure out at first. Now after 2 weeks living with his family we are traveling to the south, he told me to travel ahead so he could visit yet another family. This way he won&#x27;t get bored with my touristy stuff and I dont have to sit around all day not being able to talk to the family.
 When we were with his family we made two trips in total, 1 to sapa and one to Ha Long Bay, both times the Hotel tried to rip us off not wanting to give us the rooms we specifically booked or telling us to cancel our reservation to &quot;check in earlier and get a cheaper price&quot; we never took the offerm. In Person he could talk to the people in vietnamese and would solve the matter easily in a short time. But now I am alone and the scamming and persistencefrom drivers, sellers and hotel stuff only got worse. Today the hotel refused me to let me check in early even though we have agrees on it online and they have said that it would be no problem. Now when I wanted to check in they told me I could only check in if I cancelled the reservation or I would have to wait 2 hours more. I decided to just straight up wait, to not risk being overcharged without an receip showing the confirmed price from booking.com (many people warn you that that would happen if you cancel the reservation )
 This is my first travel alone/with a friend outside of my own country (Germany) and I don&#x27;t know what to do, it is really frustrating. Am I being overprotectiv ? Any tips on how to deal with this better would be much appreciated

                              <span>As the title suggests. But on a side note, I found in central and northern Vietnam the beef is much more tender than in the south. But generally still tough compared to other countries.

Fabulous place but omg the music is too loud (can’t hear my husband speak loud because Britney is louder than loud). Is there a gay bar/venue/pub that’s not ear splitting loud and us older Australian gays would be able to sit, drink, talk? Thanks 🙏

                              <span>Hey fellow travelers!
 I am travelling to Veitnam with my GF from 1-9 Oct. Landing in Hanoi and going back home from via Phu Quoc.
 So my Plan is: 1. 4 Days in Hanoi Ha long and Ninh Binh 2. Maybe Hoi an and danang 3. And last 2-3 Days in Phu quoc
 What I am actually confused about is whether my gf and I should go to Hoi an or not as it is monsoon season with risk of flooding. Also our iternary is too tight ;(
 So I wanted your advice on whether we should do Hoi an or visit some place else considering the weather conditions.
 It is our first time in Vietnam so we want to make sure to experience the best.
 Please help 😓 , I am pretty confused about how to do this.

                              <span>Hi I’m planning on visiting Vietnam next year and was just wondering how much I could possibly see in 2 weeks, which order would make this the most efficient, and what time of year would be best.
 I’d love to visit 
 Visit Halong Bay, Cat Ba Island, cave in Phong Nha National Park, War museum, Ban Gioc Waterfall, Golden Hands Bridge, And the Ha Giang Loop
 Is there anything else you would consider a “must see” or anything that’s not really worth it ?

 Also, what is the average price of food in Hanoi? What are some things I should look out for (food poisoning, for example)? 
 Thank you

We are very torn on what cities to travel too and want to able too explore as much as we can. We also are doing research on the country before we go, but any tips would be very appreciated. We have some cities in mind but would like to get opinions from people who have actually been to Vietnam!

 I&#x27;ve heard of this so much in my life that I considered it to be true. So I decided to visit Saigon once and twice, and I do believe they&#x27;re right. I can&#x27;t speak for the every Saigonese, I know that even for the most progressive cities, there would be people who have problems with gay people. 
 But I saw much much much more gay couples walking on the street compared to here in Hanoi. At the last firework show at the countdown thing for lunar new year, I could witness at least 6 gay couples within my eye view, some holding hand and some even had their heads on the other&#x27;s shoulder, and honestly nobody really gave a shit. …</span>

 Just wanted to post here to express how much I fucking adore this place, and random observations i have made. There are some issues and I&#x27;ll post about problems as well, but I really like Vietnam a lot.
 I&#x27;m not just some backpacker. I really did my homework on this place before coming here. It has allowed me to integrate here way faster than most people. In the space of a few days I bought a motor bike and started renting an apartment.
 I&#x27;m an English teacher (obvious I guess) and my salary is higher than many locals so I guess that clouds my perceptions of this place a little bit.
 Everything here is so much cheaper than back home. The west is stagnating and many millennials are financially fucked. Out here its possible to actually hustle ahead rather…</span>

                              <span>Hey first time traveling to Vietnam and all I can say is that it’s been a blast loving the food but I want to go explore the nightlife side. It would be a shame to explore on my own so was hopefully looking for people I could join. I’m ok if it’s just us two or if I can join your group. Leaving some information about me just so I don’t come off as a stranger.
 I’m 23 male from the Philippines currently working in global banking and finance. A personal goal I have over the next few years is to explore asia and I’ll be going to Singapore next year to watch Taylor Swift. Im responsible when I drink and can look after myself as well

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never been in a romantic relationship with anyone in my entire life and I fail to see how this might change in the long run. I personally don&#x27;t think I would be suitable for any kind of romantic relationship and the mere thought of being forced into / being a part of one makes me feel hopeless and sick. Marriage is obviously out of the question. Having kids also seems to me to be an enormous and exhaustive investment and I would not want to force any potential child to live in this increasingly difficult society without having, you know, their consent.
 However, it&#x27;s all too common that people from the older generation here tend to think that my position on marriage is simply insane and my parents are no exception. They did not stress much about the fact that I&#x27;ve never cared to have a partner (they think I&#x27;m the hot shit and millions of people would die to be wedded to me, which is objectively not the case). But now that I almost finish university and still make no move whatsoever, they constantly bring this topic up and push me to go out into the world and look for someone who would marry me and have my kid. It was kinda heartbreaking to see how badly they want to have grandchildren so I fucked up by telling them that I would marry really late, like at my 40s so that they would stop pestering me about that in the near future (and also once I&#x27;m 40s I could tell them that I&#x27;m too old for marriage). They got mildly frustrated and forced me to marry 5 years from now, for many reasons.
 People who choose to stay single, what should I do? Because I told them that I would marry late, they now think that marriage is still on the table and all they need to do is to force me to marry way sooner than I&#x27;d like. What can I say to them so that they would accept the fact that they would not have grandchildren and that their son would not marry, (and that they and I might get side-eye from relatives because of this decision)?
 I would really appreciate your responses!

                              <span>Apologies for it being so scruffy. Planning to travel through Vietnam via train from Hanoi to Saigon. How does this itinerary look? Is there anywhere on here to avoid or skip? Places that we should make the effort to go to on the way? Any advice would be appreciated :)

                              <span>I, from the North, had a chance to visit Saigon for a month. Everyone I knew told me to be careful with my belonging when I&#x27;m there, especially with me having to be extra careful because I&#x27;m careless and always walk around using my phone.
 First day in Saigon, I took a bus, and forgot my wallet with all my cash and all kinds of identification papers on there. I was so scared, I couldn&#x27;t do anything without them, I couldn&#x27;t even go back home if I wanted to without those papers. I remembered the number of the bus, the number on them showed the route they took, but couldn&#x27;t remember the exact plate numbers of the specific one I got on. There were many different busses numbered the same. 
 I thought it was the end for me. Turned out 1 and a half hour later, I found it sitting still, untouched and intact in the same bus seat I was sitting in, despite being a very crowed day with lots of people in and out of busses. During my time in Saigon, I all walked around the streets with my eyes glued to the phone, because habits. So far, nobody has tried to grab it from me. Maybe the rumors that Saigon is full of petty crime thefts is largely exaggerated?
 But hey, this could simply fall in the case of &quot;this-has-never-happened-to-me-so-it-must-not-be-true&quot; fallacy people often use. Maybe because I&#x27;m a dude?

                              <span>My partner and I are planning on visiting Vietnam around March / April next year and am having a bit of difficulty nailing down a trip that doesn&#x27;t seem too packed! We&#x27;re in our early 30&#x27;s and like a bit of a mix of adventure (more myself) and relaxation (beach time).
 We&#x27;re travelling from Australia and there aren&#x27;t any direct flights to Hanoi so we&#x27;ll be flying in and out of HCMC.
 Below is a planned schedule but something (maybe multi destinations) have to go unless we can pull superhuman strength. We&#x27;re locked into 17 nights and can&#x27;t do any longer unfortunately. Would love to hear your recommendations about what you might consider leaving off, and where to possibly spend a bit more time.
 Day 1 – Fly into Saigon. Arrive late so just stay somewhere near the airport.
 Day 2-3 - Fly to Hanoi. Spend 2 nights staying in Old Quarter, visit some sights, food tour etc.
 Day 4 - Spend morning in Hanoi before getting an afternoon bus / limousine to Ha Giang so we can see the views on the way (or should we just get a later bus and spend a few more hours in Hanoi?)
 Day 5-6 - 2 night Ha Giang Loop tour
 Day 7 - Finish Ha Giang Loop and arrive back in Hanoi late
 Day 8 - Do an overnight cruise in La Han Bay
 Day 9-10 - Head to Ninh Binh (Tam Coc) for 2 nights
 Day 11 - Spend day exploring Ninh Binh before getting overnight train to Dong Hoi
 Day 12-13 - Get bus from Dong Hoi to Phong Nha, explore caves and do a single day tour with Oxalis / Jungle Boss
 Day 14 - Get DMZ bus to Hue
 Day 15-17 - Motorcycle ride from Hue to Hoi An via Hai Van Pass, spend 3 nights in Hoi An relaxing / beach time
 Day 18 - Flight from Danang to HCMC before flying out late that night
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I am looking into getting my Vietnamese Passport and am wondering if there is anyone out there similar to me and is familiar with the process.
 I was adopted from Vietnam in 1997, shortly after became a U.S. Citizen with US Passport, etc. My adoptive parents have my original Vietnamese birth certificate and papers, since I was born in Vietnam.
 Is it a tough process to get a Vietnamese Passport? From what I read it seems like as long as I have the correct Vietnamese Paperwork it should just be a submission and waiting period. I would like to have both my US and Vietnamese Passports. Any help is much appreciated!

                              <span>attened an event where we did the national anthem (official one). And I placed my right hand over chest as I was singing it. One dude told me that only Americans do that? Which is weird, since I know it&#x27;s optional to place one&#x27;s hand over chest while doing the anthem, and it means pledging allegiance to the flag but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s exclusive for Americans. Just out of curiosity, just pop the question to see if anybody&#x27;s done the same.

                              <span>Hopefully on the correct subreddit, but my friend and I are about to book flight tickets and the flight back home will be quite early in the morning (8am). I saw people saying it is recommended to arrive 2–3 hours earlier just in case, and we are fine with that however, this means that we would need to be taking the grab from our Airbnb to the airport probably at 4/5am in the morning. 
 My question is, is it safe to take a grab car this early in the morning? We would be in Ho Chi Minh! We just want to have some confirmation that it is indeed safe, as we are both quite young and have never really travelled before. Thank you! :-)

                              <span>Danang has been a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the big city life but I just walked past an empty street, full of vendors with cartfull of nicely presented, but untouched, foods and it made me feel all kinds of ways. I bought a coconut off a lady at a drinks stall just cause she seemed really sad sitting there alone and I felt a little choked up thinking about how much she might have sold tonight in the muggy heat. 
 I get that it’s off season now but it really feels like this town lives off of tourism as I don’t see a lot of locals dining out and I might be projecting but a lot of the businesses seem to be struggling. 
 I just feel very sad seeing all these restaurants with flashy signs sitting empty and potentially even guilty when I make eye contact with the employees inside as I catch glimmers of hope in their eyes that I might come in and dine. 
 I’m recovering from a tummy bug and taking precautions as to not eat at empty places and there are so many coconuts I can buy from a place to support the local businesses. 
 It’s really lovely here though and the people have been so kind. Other than being slightly hotter, it hasn’t even been as rainy as in HCMC so I wish more people would come and visit this lovely place.

                              <span>Hi, had a job interview and everything was ok but when I mentioned I was Muslim i got told That it would be hard because their customers aren’t comfortable with that. I understand stereotypes exist and people in different regions of the world give more credit to them than other parts of the world. Do people in Vietnam in generally have a thing against Muslims ? No judgment, people can think what they like I just want to know because I’ve never come across this in Vietnam before (although I wasn’t that shocked, I wanted to know if there’s any truth to it) .
 Edit: the second question she asked me was about religion after the usual tell me about yourself. Looking back I should have asked if it’s relevant but I didn’t think it would be a problem. Seeing Vietnam’s views on religion I totally understand but she mentioned Muslims and her clients not liking the idea of it.

I’m not sure if I did something wrong when installing it or if I need to activate something or maybe it’s just not a good connection? Any advice anyone has would be super appreciated!

He always hit himself by banging his head) when I said I want to break up or When I don’t want to talk to him. Most of the time he bit himself I saw it all. And I feel like he is threatening me. Especially, he makes more money than me. I always heard he said that: &quot;I think some people make little money because they were lazy in school, blabla&quot;. Also, he always talks &quot;I want to have a million dollar, so I need to save more money,.. &quot;I feel it&#x27;s good and I know he can gain to it. But I feel very tired when I listen to this thing every day. I also feel we didn&#x27;t match in this relationship. What should I do?. I am afraid of a day when I want to break up with him, he will do something silly

 Yeah, this is a sweep generalization. But we Vietnamese tend to be alot more appreciative of sex and nudity related subjects in foreign art, but when Vietnamese do it, the first reaction from us tend to be throwing stone calling it \&quot;violation of traditional morality\&quot; (vi phạm thuần phong mỹ tục), \&quot;cheap fanservice bait\&quot;,etc...
 An example: “Ghệ iu dấu của e” by tlinh caused controversy among Vietnamese audience, and that song is kiddy compared to Doja Cat’s music, and Doja Cat’s works are widely consumed by Vietnamese with zero controversy.
 This encompasses all kinds of art mediums including music, photography, cinema, literature,etc...As someone who works in art/creative industry. Sex and nudity aren&#x27;t simply &quot;vulgar subjects to satisfy cheap horniness&quot;, sex is a great part of the…</span>

                              <span>BT mình đã khá khó chịu r mà như trường hợp mới gặp sáng nay đúng là lộn hết cả ruột khi gặp 2 bạn nữ mất hơn 10p để thanh toán bằng chuyển khoản, bắt cả hàng chục người đằng sau đứng chờ, trong đấy có mình có nhiều người khác rất vội đổ xăng để đi làm. 2 bạn rõ biết ăn mặc chải chuốt mà sao ý thức kém thế, trả tiền xong còn mất thêm tgian mở yên xe, lấy túi xách bỏ đt vào, bỏ túi xách vào cốp đóng lại nữa mới chịu rời khỏi chỗ đổ xăng, thậm chí người đằng sau nhắc còn hất cằm thách thức nữa.
 Trả tiền mặt chỉ mất tầm 15-30s, trong khi chuyển khoản hay momo để trả tiền xăng nhanh nhất cũng mất 1, 2p để người bán lấy máy, nhập số tiền r sinh mã để các bạn quét, đợi thanh toán xong và trả kết quả về máy. Còn lâu hơn nhiều nếu như 2 bạn trên còn mò tìm nhập mã giảm giá, tìm điểm phát wifi 4G, etc. Thử tưởng tượng giờ cao điểm chỉ cần 2, 3 bạn như thế thì những người đằng sau mất bao nhiêu thời gian? 1 cái tiện nhỏ của các bạn có thể làm mất bao thời gian và tiền bạc của nhiều người khác.

 None of them have ever had jobs and it’s even seen as “pointless” because apparently there’s an amazing office job waiting at the end of the rainbow.
 It really strikes me as odd as a Vina that grew up Canada. Does your average Vietnamese actually have THAT MUCH faith in the school system that it will teach a person everything they need to know?

I&#x27;ll be traveling in Northern Vietnam and I&#x27;m wondering how common cashews and pistachios (including cashew oil) is in the cuisine? And, if it&#x27;s common, any tips on particular dishes to avoid?
 I&#x27;m deathly allergic to cashews and pistachios but I can eat peanuts, almonds, walnuts, and pecans -- though I don&#x27;t always trust folks to make that distinction.

 My budget is only 2-3mil and I saw that most of rentals in Facebook groups are way out of my budget. What&#x27;s the usual monthly range for a decent apartment for 1 person? 
 I&#x27;m looking for a place in the An Thuong area since that&#x27;s where our co working is at. 
 Any tips/advice for me?

                              <span>One of my favorite places to get coffee was the one right by my granny&#x27;s home, an old lady would sell beverages to the local construction workers there, and her coffee would be around 20000 VND. I had been drinking her Ca Phe Sua Da for years, and I loved it so much I would buy one almost every single day. Unfortunately, she closed the place indefinitely around a month ago, and I have tried many places since.
 The one thing I noticed was I would find the street coffees drastically better than the ones sold in those fancy cafeteria places with ACs and Jazz music playing 24/7. The street Ca Phe Sua Da are sweet, rich, just bitter enough, and their temperature is perfect - not too hot, not too cold. 
 It is extremely hard to match the flavor with the one I had been drinking for all these years though. Some places make it too bitter with little sweetness, some make it taste like a milkshake. The &quot;closest&quot; one which I kind of enjoy comes from, you guest it, the nice middle-aged lady not too far away from my grandma&#x27;s home. 
 Is there a secret to those street coffees? I want to remake it myself, all those years drinking her coffee and now she closed it, it kinda hurt a little bit :&gt;

                              <span>Vietnam non-expert here, thanks in advance for your patience and replies.
 My question is about both politics and economics.
 Vietnam is considered to be more open than China, in terms of investment as well as censorship.
 However, China also had a period where it was considered much more open than it is today.
 Many people describe Vietnam as being very similar to China, only delayed by 20 years or so. On the other side, some people say that there is a qualitative difference between the two countries, due to the different &quot;tone&quot; under which Vietnam was founded - Ho Chi Minh being a world traveler, having Democratic hopes for Vietnam, appreciating Western Democracy, etc. Those people also say that power is a bit less centralized in Vietnam&#x27;s system.
 However, without institutions in place …</span>

                              <span>I’ve been close to this one vietnamese girl ( elder than me around 30’s) . I am really into her and i travelled to HCM just to see her. She works in malaysia and travel back everymonth. We are close sweet and everything but yet she just remains as friends because of her job. But I don’t get the fact that she cares differently and we argue alot when i do small mistakes. She acts like a small baby around me when we are together but texts like so boringly when on the phone. It’s my first time being with a Vietnamese girl so im still actually learning her culture. Anybody could give any advice?

                              <span>I hate these yellow ugly looking death trap buses of Bao Yen especially line 60A. Both drivers and bus boys have no manners. Always late (1 HOUR wait has become a norm this past 2 weeks) and drive the buses like it&#x27;s a motorbike. On top of that, most have broken ACs or doors won&#x27;t close completely. You can&#x27;t track the buses accurately. Unfortunately VinBuses don&#x27;t pass by Ciputra in Hanoi. I&#x27;d pay 20k for a premium bus experience. 
 Fucking Bao Yen.

                              <span>I went to a public pool with my nephew yesterday, it was very crowded. And at the kid&#x27;s pool area, I could notice that it&#x27;s much harder for me to find a kid being in shape than to find a kid who&#x27;s not. Almost every little kids I saw carried a big belly with them. There&#x27;re so many adults who are overweights too.
 I know that one public pool with max of 100 people isn&#x27;t exactly great of a sample size to draw conclusion for millions of Vietnamese. But it does raise some concern, because in my experience, Vietnamese parents don&#x27;t really care much about diets, calories and nutrions. They all thought the fatter the kids, the better, and subsequently trying to feed them as much as possible. And if they aren&#x27;t gaining in size and being underweigh, it&#x27;s not their &quot;growing up times&quot; yet. Fast foods aren&#x27;t really that popular, I think, so we can&#x27;t blame it on them
 I was 173cm, 45kg for most of my childhood, throughout my earlier years, my parents and relatives has kept telling I&#x27;m not at my &quot;time&quot; yet, and kept taking me to doctors and they weirdly said the same, not &quot;my time&quot; yet. Turned out at 22 years old, I was still that skinny. It&#x27;s not until I decided to eat like hell and learn nutrions did I gained 10kg in 2-3 months. They complmented me saying I&#x27;m finally &quot;at my time&quot;, no I just ate like crazy.

                              <span>I was going through the luggage scanner and I got pulled over by the lady for no reason. My luggage just had my clothes and random shampoo and body care stuff for my family. My Vietnamese is pretty good but not good enough to understand what she was trying to pull me over for. I remember my uncle saying something like if they give me a hard time just give them $20. I literally gave her $20 and she’s like no it’s $50. And to shove it discreetly in the drawer for her. I didn’t carry that much cash with me and was planning to withdraw some from the ATM. And I didn’t like how that lady was threatening me so I called my aunt. My aunt told me to ask her for the citation receipt and she said she was trying to help me but we can do it the “hard way” and I have to pay $200 wtf. My aunt wanted to speak to her and she told me to hang up and refused to talk to my aunt and told me I’m a grown adult to take care of it myself. Luckily my aunt knew someone in the airport and he spoke to them and they let me go without paying anything. I wasn’t annoyed they do shady stuff like that, I was annoyed how she spoke to me!
 Edit - I’d also like to point out that scanner lady is a complete moron because she asked for my passport and didn’t flip to the right page with all my info. She pretended to be all official demanding my documentations.

                              <span>In 2021-2022, I developed anxiety disorder with attacks, resulting from my undiagnosed ADHD. I knew immediately when I wanted treatment that I would never get it from any big or small general hospital. I found one that specialized in mental health and was able to get &quot;what I need&quot;. Which means pills and an affirmation that I have what I suspect I have, nothing more. Still, that was better than other people&#x27;s stories. One person shared that they were publicly mocked by the doctor in the mental health department of Bạch Mai for their suicidal tendency. My God, what the fk!
 Horribly, I told my parents, who were not equipped to handle this, so they reacted &quot;unhelpfully&quot;.

                              <span>As a Vietnamese, I notice this. And it not that long ago, just from our grandfather gerenation, France, US, Japan, China. But in our daily like we don&#x27;t hold grudges or actively say hateful thing toward the nation and it people from the invaders day. Like in our daily life we still talk about them with no hate feeling and very neutral. Except for China, China still actively messing with us and have not give up. Even though, our economy is greatly effect, reply on China we aware of them.
 That my perspective as Vietnamese live our daily life. So what other nation is like, because it seems like China still hate Japan, media about Japan and protry Japan as bad where china kick their ass still very popular til today. From Japan media, it seem like Japan still effects by some contract with the US but from some Japanese movie it seem like also protray Japan have their sin. And worst of all is racist thing in America, black still hate white af and still think they are oppressed today. This remind me how different that is in Vietnam, because we also have minority. If you live in some era where you can still see some local people living among us, they look actually very different than the usual Vietnam people, some also have really dark skin and different hair, if you look in too school system there are also advance thing you can get if you are &quot;Dan toc thieu so&quot; (Wait a minutes, we too have black people). And if you take a look at history, we totally invaded them local, But we are never have racism or hear of them, Now they are one of us. We hate no one, except 36, which is by their own reputation so...

I read that tourists cannot leave the country if they have over 300g of gold without getting permission from the State Bank. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has gone through this experience with gold, or other precious metals like silver?

 And I can&#x27;t believe that not enough folks are taking advantage of the promotion Remitly is running.
  
Pay zero fees on your first transfer. Get $20 off your first transfer when you send $100 or more.
  
The math: Send $100 from the U.S. to a Vietnamese bank account, cash pickup location, or home delivery, and it will only cost you $80. Remitly will cover the other $20. Oh, and there is no fee!
 So here we go...
 Step 1: Click here to sign up for a Remitly account (click the green &quot;Send Now&quot; button).
 Step 2: Enter your email address and password.

 I know this is an odd route, going against the tide of people trying to into U.S. residency.

 What is the typical length of resid…</span>

 Scary silence. Cheerful Darkness. Sans Chaos ..... HCMC, Vietnam
 Even the most chaotic corner of the city , where I&#x27;m holed up in my my current Chaos Haven, slowly slips into scary silence , as the hour hand moves farther and farther from 12. 
 Standing on the balcony I feel what Edvard Munch may have, before The Scream. Scary Silence . Cheerful Darkness

                              <span>Hi 
 Me and my 10 year old son are planning to travel to Vietnam for Christmas holiday. We plan to fly to Hanoi (4 days) . Then we have 10 more days. We were planning to visit Ha long and stay there on rest of the days but I realised december is chilly. Then I accept to pay for another flight to Ho chi Min city to be closer to the beaches but I read here about Vung Tau, water is brownish and full of garbage. 
 I checked some list of beaches but some beaches can be more suitable for surfers. I want to avoid them. There is never a clear info which beach is suitable for which purpose
 Do you have any idea where can we go for swimming for a week from Hanoi or Ho Chi Min city easily?
 Thanks in advance

 I am from central EU and I am looking for a new place to live in for few years.
 Is it hard to get visa in Vietnam, is Vietnam safe to live in, what is the average cost of living in medium populated city?

                              <span>Just after I booked via Booking.com (flexible rate, which I guaranteed with my credit card details) I got a message via Booking and received the following information, among others:
 PAYMENT TERMS: Since reservations via Booking.com are not yet PAID, so the payment must be PAID in Full in ADVANCE before the travel date. Basing on real past customers&#x27; experience and due to the busy and tight schedule and limitation of internet / 3gb connection in Halong bay to guarantee a smoothly trip we require the customer to make the payment completely in advance to avoid these common issues/ problems which will affect seriously your precious time with us such as: Unsuccessful payment due to the internet connection. Being stressful and confused about the payment method after the trip. Problem with customer own credit card (Invalid card, insufficient funds) Since credit card charging is no longer our payment method, we will send you the Invoice via Secured Online Payment Link: Just complete your payment by using VISA/ MASTER and JVC card (2.8 % bank charges)
 And, after asking something:
 “The card info that you provide on booking is just to ensure booking, It doesn&#x27;t charge any amount. Guests will pay via a Government secured link, and we guarantee that you just pay One time for the trip, Never Double charge Do you have whatsapp to contact you better?“
 Is this common practice of handling a payment and I am too sceptical? It sounds a bit suspicious to me and I have booked a few other hotels for this trip but have not received such a payment method / request.
 Appreciate your help!!

                              <span>This comes from my experience taking care of my sister. She tried to commit suicide by overdosing on paracetamol, and she was obviously rushed to the hospital. The hospital was Bach Mai Hospital, which I heard was one of the best hospitals in the country. It made me more shocked when, even in the best hospital, I heard a lot of people and even one of the doctors talk about how suicidal people should not be allowed to receive treatment. &quot;Because they want to die anyway.&quot; they say. It was infuriating because my sister could also hear them. She even commented about it, saying she agreed. She wasn&#x27;t in her right mind, and it makes me so upset that people could say such a thing in front of a patient. I know Vietnam still wasn&#x27;t very knowledgeable about mental health, but it wasn&#x27;t even about that. It&#x27;s about a person&#x27;s life; even if they want to take their own life, you are not to treat them differently. It&#x27;s sickening.

                              <span>Hey!
 I’ve been in Vietnam for about two months now and I’m currently sat having a coffee on the Walking Street. One of the buildings across the road started throwing what looks like money and rice off the roof and everyone started yelling and scrambling to grab the notes. There’s now a crowd (with people running up the street to join) and it looks like they are handing out money.
 I was just wondering if anyone could explain what’s happening?
 Thanks :)
 Edit: this is in HCMC as I realised I didn’t add that before. The building is a guest house but the ground floor is covered in yellow flowers and flags so may be a religious site

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to add that things are rarely black and white, and parents rarely abuse their children for their own pleasures.
 Most parents genuinely love their children and family. And you can see that they themselves are victims of toxic parenting and they themselves suffer from the mental trauma that they don&#x27;t know. We can try to convince them that their way of parenting is wrong but with generations upon generations of trauma and &quot;tradition brainwashing&quot; (so to speak), coupled with the lack of Vietnamese language resources, it&#x27;s really hard for them to realize that the traditional way of parenting is damaging to the mental health of their children.
 So it&#x27;s up to us the younger generations who are equipped with better knowledge to break the cycle, be more understanding to our children at the same time try to fix our own mental trauma so that we don&#x27;t fall into the old ways.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 Kind greetings from Ireland.
 I am an Irish American man in my mid twenties. I am currently considering relocating to Vietnam in early 2024 for a minimum of 1 year. I am considering teaching either or both PE (physical education) and English. Currently I have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Exercise science and I am shortly die to complete my masters in strength and conditioning. I also have TEFL 120hrs certificate. 
 I don&#x27;t have any specific question, I am more just looking for advice and insight to what life could potentially be like for me.

                              <span>Hi guys. 
 I’m a huge history fan, and I have studied Vietnamese history for many years.
 Soon I idol be visiting Vietnam for the second time, and I would love to know where I can go to buy antiques in Vietnam. I’m not interested in replicas. Especially war replicas. I will be in many different cities. I have heard there are certain “if you know where to go” places you can get some nice antiques, so I would love to know where to look.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at traveling to Northern VietNam (Hanoi) in December. For some context, I live in Canada, will be traveling solo, and am looking at going through a couple weeks. 
  
After doing some research, it seems that one of the biggest challenges is getting around VietNam. Alot of posts say the best way to get around is by motorcycle, however I don&#x27;t have a motorcycle license nor do I know how to ride a motorcycle. With motorcycle out of the picture, what is the next best way to get around?
 One thing I&#x27;ve found from traveling to other places is you save $$$ when you book tours through the street vendors and not through the airline/travel agency. Are there street vendors in VietNam that you can walk up to and book a tour right then and there, or is it better to book them beforehand? I&#x27;ve seen a few websites selling travel excursions in VietNam.
 Almost all the excursions to Ha Long Bay I&#x27;ve found include an overnight cruise. Being December (one of the worst months for rough seas) and someone who gets sea sick easily, is it possible to go on a boat for a few hours and head back to Hanoi on the same day? Or is it better to spend the night somewhere around Ha Long Bay?
 What would be a good way to get to Sa Pa? Google says it&#x27;s ~5 hours by car and ~7 hours by train. Similar to Ha Long Bay, is it recommended/possible to stay in Sa Pa overnight?
 Any other recommendations?

                              <span>Me and my Gf are visiting Vietnam in November. I myself really want to do the Ha giang loop but gf is very hesitant. I have a little to none motorcycle experience but she has not (we skate and cycle tho so we&#x27;re pretty agile, also plan on maybe practice a bit on a motorcylce there and see how comfortable we are). Is it do-able or really as bad as they say? My way of thinking is just that if the road gets tricky we&#x27;ll just slow down take our time and watch out, or even do part by foot. If it&#x27;s just not possible to do it on a motorbike, can you do it by car or (part) on foot, is it still worth it then?

                              <span>i only know how to speak VN in the context of interacting with my family members. so with my aunts/uncles, i say “cháu” for myself, with parents/grandparents i say “con”, with my older cousins i say my name or “em.” i didn’t grow up in an area with lots of vn restaurants or shops so i never learned how to properly communicate with a stranger who isn’t related to me. anwyay i went to paris this weekend and found a vietnamese pho restaurant, i don’t speak french, the shopowners were happy to be able to speak vn but the problem is i just didn’t know how to talk about myself or them and thus construct basic sentences even though it’s my first language… so they’d ask like “khu gần đây đẹp quá?” i wanted to say “[i] think so too” or “what do [you] do for a living” but i wasn’t sure what word was appropriate if you aren’t sure how are you supposed to address someone and call yourself?

                              <span>Apparently Uber drivers can’t see where the rider’s going until they accept the ride and I wonder if this is the case for Grab too? 
 I’m asking as I want to travel from Da nang to Hoi an and I worry it might leave the driver “stranded” if he doesn’t find a customer on his way back. It’ll cost roughly 350k dong for the 40min-1hr trip (one way) and it’d make me feel somewhat better if I knew the driver has a choice in his choosing of rides

I&#x27;ve travelled extensively through SEA but that was over 20 years ago and I am a male. Should she be concerned of being overwhelmed trying to figure out how to find her Grab ride and everything coming at her before getting her bearings ? What can I get her to do to make it easier and safer if anything?

 So far the dishes that seem to do this for me are
  
Bun cha
 Banh Mi
 Sometimes Pho or Bun Bo Hue
  
I know I&#x27;m missing out on some classic dishes that are always delicous. Please help! I live in Saigon btw. 
 I also like beef salad. But when I get chicken salad the chicken is so hard to chew it&#x27;s not working for me.

                              <span>I’m looking to sell a Diamond ring. My mom suggested I sell it when I go back to Vietnam vs selling while I’m in the the US. She says I’ll get more money that way. I’m a little nervous about getting ripped off because its very obvious I’m a foreigner. Would I even get more money? Also if I wanted to buy a jewelry while I’m there, how often do you get sold fakes? I know nothing about jewelry and I feel like I could easily get dupped. Maybe I’m just too suspicious but she seems to think I’d get more of my moneys worth in Vietnam.

                              <span>I am hoping to travel to Vietnam mid to late February. I know tet is on the 10th so I’m wondering what traveling will be like in the week or so after that? I have read that Tet occurs for 9 days but have also seen that it could be longer so am hoping to get some insight on it. Will tours and resturaunts still be operating or will things still be pretty shut down? Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi. I am travelling to Vietnam for 1 month in october. I have had all the vaccines my government says are essential, but there are some that are up to yourself to determine if you need them. These are the vaccines for rabies, japanese encephalitus and malaria. I tried asking in travel forums, but they say &quot;ask your doctor&quot;, which I obviously already have, but it is up to me to determine these three on my own.
 What do you think is necessary? I am travelling throughout the country, National Parks, trekking in the northern region, but mostly tourist places.

                              <span>Once a guy tried to sell me some boxing classes. I said i have a certain weight goal in mind. He said its impossible because i have kids, which i dont, he just assumes that base on my age.
 Today i went to a spa for a free facial treatment, the girl of course tried to sell me the package. By the end she said after the treatment you gonna look so beautiful im gonna introduce someone to you. Like i cant get a guy by myself or i need to change anything about myself to get a guy. I talked to another girl earlier i said im not sure i want to have kids, she said im so short sided.
 They are sales people, they need to focus on the product, not people personal life. There are zillion reasons why someone is where they are. If you dont know dont just make assumptions. I know the culture is nosy but assumption is not the answer.

                              <span>Most men I&#x27;ve met and talked to disapproved of them, saying that they&#x27;re way too effeminate. 
 Do most Vietnamese men hold the same opinion? I mean, Vietnam, or any Asian country for that matter, is heavily affected by Korea entertainment industry. Korea, in itself, is a kingdom and trend-setter in terms of entertainment and beauty, it&#x27;s no doubt we are somewhat influenced by them. Most of our hairstyles, or fashion styles, right now follows what&#x27;s trendy in Korea, which would affect what Vietnamese choose to wear and what clothes are produced and promoted for men fashion. 
 I&#x27;ve heard Vietnamese men complaining complaining endlessly on Facebook too, wondering why women likes such girly boys. But I think if they don&#x27;t have any appeal at all to women, they won&#x27;t be that successful and loved. Maybe what men thinks women find attractive is drastically different than what women actually find attractive.
 For me, as a gay men and somewhat masculine, I find half of them very pleasing to the eyes, very &quot;pretty&quot;, the other half too effeminate for my taste. They are &quot;beautiful&quot;, but not &quot;hot.&quot; But it depends on which idol though, some has a perfect blend of masculinity and feminity, of handsomeness and gracefulness that makes them hotter than any 6-packs Western bros.
 Do Vietnamese men like the image of male K-pop idols?

                              <span>this is going to be a long post, I am sorry.
 Backstory: I am not Vietnamese, don&#x27;t have Vietnamese family and look European/American. A few years ago I met some Vietnamese friends in high school and my became interested in the country, culture and language. Last summer i came to Ho Chi Minh for two months to take Vietnamese classes (I am a university student so I came during my break), had a great time and met really nice people. I wasn&#x27;t planning on coming back this summer but things worked out and I am back in Ho Chi Minh for a month, continuing my vietnamese classes.
 A friend that I met last summer and saw a few times the past two weeks, &quot;May&quot;, invited me to her hometown this weekend for independence day weekend. She lives in the Mekong Delta River Region and said that she wanted me t…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never understood people&#x27;s obsession with having a son, a male heir. My father, for example, abandoned his previous wives because they couldn&#x27;t bring him a son. It was not until my mother, and not until having 5 daughters prior to having me, did he have a son.
 But sadly, that son, which is me, is gay. Don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s ironic? The way my father was obsessed with having a son, and he turned out to be gay? I guess it&#x27;s his karma. Never mind, he abandoned my mother too and he has never existed to me in my mind.
 It&#x27;s just that a family in my neighborhood, who are really poor, they have three young daughters already and they&#x27;re still pushing for another one in hope it&#x27;s a boy. Watching the mother with a big belly and three daughters already barely having enough to eat and study pains my heart. 
 Why the obsession with having to have a boy? Um, he could be gay, you know? He could be a transgender. He could die young? He could be a drug addict and a failure, in which case you must have 3 or 4 sons in case then?

                              <span>In the midst of crazy public holiday traffic last night I jumped out of a Grab when I could not knowing my phone slipped from me while doing so, and by the time I realised and ran back he was gone. As a solo traveller it was daunting to think what I should do and what I couldn&#x27;t do without my phone. Trying not to panic, I went to the nearby security guard of a mall. He understood the gist of what I said and took me to the mall information desk. Now, I assumed in the crowded noisy and busy place they would just wave me away and say go to the police station or something. But they jumped into action, got my details and number (thank f*** I had my Vietnam phone number written down seperately on hand), took my photo and messaged security to go over CCTV to try to get the car plate number, let me use their phone to see if I could get any Grab details from my email, and kept calling my phone when they could. 
 The CCTV couldn&#x27;t get a plate number. I feared the driver wouldn&#x27;t hear my phone or would just keep it, but eventually the driver answers. He had finished for the day but would drive back, although it would take time with all the traffic. I expected he would want a compensation for time and fuel and honesty, but when he eventually arrived he refused the cash in my hand. I made him accept a bag of those holiday moon cake things the mall was selling as a thank you, and I also went back and bought a couple for the information desk ladies afterwards. 
 This is a simple faith in humanity restored post because I feared the worst and was touched by how much they cared, especially at such a busy working time for them, for some tourist. Caring for others makes a difference.

                              <span>We are in Da Nang for a few months and just outside the city there’s a good beach spot along the highway just past the Lady Buddha. There is a man there who charges you to park your scooter on the shoulder of the highway. Is this normal? Seems strange we are paying a random guy (no uniform or signage anywhere) to park on the side of a public road. Appreciate any help!

                              <span>Even in the US, comedy shows of Ali Wong often recognize the superiority of Chinese and denigrate the Vietnamese as &#x27;jungle people&#x27;. I hear this term a lot. Even from Chinese kids who grew up or were born in the US. In fact, I actually hear a lot more disgusting racial slurs directed at Vietnamese by Chinese than just &#x27;jungle people&#x27;.
 Chinese ain&#x27;t that tall and their scrawny looking military appears extremely funny versus the US. So why the hate? Explain.

                              <span>I just ordered on the website since there was a sale going on for the product i wanted.
 It seems to have a bad reputation since i have seen a lot of people online saying that they lost their product or that the carrier says it is just updating tracking and there being fake or poor quality products on the website, most of them i see from mostly old comments and posts from 3-5 years ago, usually with not much proof than just words, can anyone reassure me on this?

                              <span>Im sure this is often posted on here but during my travels of Vietnam with my partner next February we are debating doing a Ha Long Bay cruise?
 They seem expensive so trying to figure out if it’s worth it. Lots of research I’ve done so far highlights the trash and the fact it’s a massive tourist trap.
 What do people think? We are English, I’ve travelled a lot and her not so much. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I will be arriving in your beautiful country tomorrow as the last stop on a business trip. I will fly out again Thursday morning. Unfortunately I&#x27;ll be working most days, and probably taken out to dinner in the evening. Is there anything I can/should buy and have shipped to the hotel, that would be guaranteed to arrive by Wednesday to make sure I get it before leaving? Anything from candies, to souvenirs, gifts for my wife, etc. Ideally links would be great too! I&#x27;ll be in Saigon if that makes any difference. 
 Thanks so much in advance!

                              <span>These people live maybe a few years in Nam, get stepped on in a crowded elevator at rush hour and scream &#x27;selfish culture&#x27; at the top of their lung. They get cut on the road by other bikes at rush hour where everyone just want to get home in a traffic jam and scream. 
 While those behavior can be labeled selfish, they made up one small part of one side of the knife. People will go out of their way to hold the elevator door open for me everyday, and im a man. If you ran out of gas and pushing your bike on the road, it wont take long until someone stop and ask, even drive off and buy you a can. 
 It&#x27;s not to say Vietnamese people are not selfish for doing those thing. It&#x27;s to say they act on the polar opposite on different circumstance. So those examples doesnt really say anything about the culture itself.

 No wonder everyone&#x27;s depressed these days (from Bạch Mai hospital statistic, there&#x27;s an average of 40000 suicides each year in Vietnam) and nobody wanna give birth, generational trauma carry on through generations.

                              <span>Hello, I am currently having a grand time in Vietnam and will be here for another week. I take this supplement called Betaine HCl which is just stomach acid for digestion. I&#x27;m not gonna die if I run out but boy does it help with digestion and the farts. 
 So far I have visited several Pharmacies and saw other supplements but not this one.
 Does anyone know? Thank you for your help.

                              <span>So, I am in Hanoi and I noticed the flags and posters everywhere saying something will happen on september 2nd. Looked it up and it&#x27;s the Vietnam&#x27;s National Independence Day. Very cool!
 Last night was super busy in the city, with all the streets closed off, wasn&#x27;t expecting that (cause it&#x27;s the night before?) but it was nice. My guidebook states that there is a parade with fireworks somewhere, but my host wasn&#x27;t aware of this. Maybe you guys know? It&#x27;ll be my last day in Vietnam so it would be nice to end it off with some celebration.

I really enjoy sitting outside with a cold one while people watching here in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve been drinking Heineken 0.0 but would like a little variety. Has anyone run across any othe non-alcoholic beer options here in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hello Vietnam! How much should I really pay for buying shoes? (Nike or Onitsuka) from the market? I think anywhere where between 300K- 400K is good enough. All shopkeepers pushing for 800K, what do you suggest?

                              <span>I will land in Saigon on 7th Sept early morning.
 I have around 21-22 days. Plannint to fly out of Hanoi. 
 I want to explore the major places, I know, its not possible to explore this big country in just 3 weeks.
 Plan is to see HCMC, Museums, Cu chi tunnel. Explore the street food. Then visit da nang/Hoi an and do activities there. Bana hills, eat good food. 
 Then move to Hanoi. Then Ninh bin. 1 day trip to Lan ha bay. 2 days to Sapa fom Hanoi. 
 I am not going to Ha xiang region. Just want to see Sapa.
 I want to try the sleeper night trains from Saigon to Danang. Is it worth or better to book the flight or bus? Are the buses comfortable enough to sleep?
 Also, please tell me which bank ATM has zero cost on cash withdrawal?
 If I purchase eletronic items like Phone/Drone etc, will I get VAT refund at the airport? How much vat refund can I get ?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Was wondering if any expats have gone through an IVF procedure in Vietnam and willing to talk about it? We&#x27;re deciding on whether to go through the process but cost is a major issue. In the US it costs $30k per procedure. We&#x27;ve considered either going back to France where IVF can be done for $5k or Vietnam. I&#x27;ve seen VN fertility clinics that will do the procedure for $3k to $5k. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>This is a serious question. Because this salary is not low, it is too low. It is even lower than the salary of low-skilled workers. Only $200/month? Prime Minister $600/month (To avoid the situation where many people say that salaries in many countries are also low). How to live with this salary? Or do you simply love your job or love your country so choose it?
 Please answer honestly.

Knowing the cities are full of beer bucket spots and people drinking outside I take it not everyone is using grab. Question is, on a good weekend at night are there a lot of drunk people on the road? Or do they head home a with a sober guy in the group?

                              <span>Không biết ở đây có ai nắm rõ về lịch sử không, nhưng tôi khá là tò mò về vấn đề này:
 Nhìn theo mốc thời gian, giai đoạn này chữ Quốc Ngữ đã tồn tại, thậm chí còn có cả báo ra bằng chữ Quốc Ngữ (Gia Định báo, 1865).
 Hai cuộc chiến tranh Nha Phiến đã kết thúc (1860). Pháp đã chiếm xong Lục Tỉnh (1867). Về lý thuyết, dường như không lạ nếu có người Việt nhìn ra sức mạnh của phương Tây bấy giờ so với triều đình nhà Nguyễn. Điều này căn bản không khác gì lối suy nghĩ của Duy Tân Minh Trị ở Nhật Bản lúc bấy giờ cả. Nhưng thực tế thì theo ghi chép lịch sử có ai như vậy ở Việt Nam, nhất là khu vực phía Bắc không?
 Đồng thời, phong trào Văn Thân từ năm 1864 đã có, khởi nguồn cũng ở miền Bắc, Trung. Bình Tây, sát tả nhắm vào người Công Giáo, nhưng khó có thể phủ nhận còn giết hại cả những người không theo Công Giáo (lương dân) thân Pháp, nhất là sau biến cố Bắc Kỳ (1873).
 Vậy giai đoạn ở giữa thì sao? Có bất cứ ghi chép gì về sự tồn tại của một ai đó đã bắt đầu tiến hành Tây học vào giai đoạn này không? Nếu có thì cách nhìn của xã hội với (những) người này như thế nào?

 My mom referred to them as amidan. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve heard this term used since I was a kid and as an adult now I&#x27;m curious.. was this also one of those borrowed words from the French?
 There are plenty of examples of words that were from the French and I was curious if this was one of them. Amidan to me just doesn&#x27;t sound Viet.. but hey.. I could be wrong.

I’m mixed viet and white, while I don’t believe I’m connected enough to get citizenship (grandmother is viet, I’m 1/4) we still keep in contact with family and visited 2013. I feel happier when I’m with my viet family, I feel more at home with them than in the US, and am welcome to live with them when I am there (I think this is legal if I register with police). We are visiting soon again and I will consult people when I visit but was wondering if I’d be able to take some capital from the US and open a business over there. It seems like you have to invest a certain threshold, aka be a big time corporate investor where I’m trying to start a smaller business. I would appreciate the inputs.

                              <span>I recently checked Zing News website and apparently they are offline for 3 months due to some violation in Vietnam. I like Zing News because they have some nice Infographics. I only know Vnexpress and Vietcetera. Did you also ran into this problem with other news platform in Vietnam?

                              <span>Are you shocked? I remember once having a friend from Saigon come over when it was both the coldest time of the year and also the rainiest. Anyone having lived in the North would know how suck it is when it&#x27;s both bone-chilling cold and rains heavily.
 Let&#x27;s say, he came unprepared. He was shocked and scarred for life, lol. His expectation of what&#x27;s considered cold was vastly different to how cold it was actually. He barely brought any practical jackets to keep himself warm.

                              <span>So.. when I landed at HCMC airport I bought a viettel sim with unlimited data along with a bunch of other foreigners who had just landed. It supposedly comes with 100mins of call time and unlimited data for 30 days.
 I haven’t had any issue with it so far and been getting by without connecting to the wifi once but I’m now reading that unlimited data plan doesn’t exist? 
 I thought I got a pretty good deal and would like to renew if possible but now I’m confused what plan it even was that I got

                              <span>Hi all,
 Currently in Phu Quoc and looking for some recommendations for good seafood! My partner hasn&#x27;t really had any decent seafood in her life so figured this would be a good opportunity. 
 Any recommendations for good restaurants and dishes to try? (Crab, squid, fish are safe options.) Thank you!

                              <span>So my guy friend just had his left ear pierced and as a joke I said why didn’t you get both sides done. He was told apparently by the piercer not to get the right ear pierced unless he wants to indicate to others his homo sexuality. Suddenly I started noticing other guys having left ear piercings (and not gay). Coincidence? Or is that a real thing here in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m curious and just wanted to hear more about how English teachers in Vietnam felt and managed while in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve selected Vietnam as my first teaching destination.
 -Monthly income? What did you actually make as an entry level teacher?
 -How many days did you really work each week? Was it exhausting? Start time &amp; End time.
 -I plan to take Vietnamese language classes during my free time. Will I have time outside of work for languages classes?
 -What&#x27;s the most efficient way to learn Vietnamese from scratch? I know its extremely difficult to learn. My goal is to at least be about to speak like a Vietnamese toddler after 1.5 years of practice.
 I&#x27;m also very introverted and at times a little closed off. I just have to fight that habit I have of isolating myself. Idk why I love alone time so much haha. But overall I have positive interactions with almost everyone and Im pretty approachable. I hope to come across people from all walks of life while in Vietnam. My parents are Nigerian but I was born in America so I got to experience two cultures growing up. I just love learning about other cultures.
 Lastly, how&#x27;s dating/making friends scene in Vietnam?? I would like a social life. 
 Is a long term stay feasible as an English teacher in Vietnam? Or at all as an English&#x27;s teacher. I do hold a Masters degree, Im hoping that helps with future promotions after I gather more teaching experience. What do you think?
 I&#x27;m also a Registered Nurse in America. Im 35 years old. Im 6&#x27;3 and Black. Would I do best in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh?
 Advice, honest opinions and experiences are all welcomed.

                              <span>Hi all - I am travelling to Vietnam soon and have an allergy* to pork (*sensitivity - it makes me extremely sick but now life threateningly so) and I was wondering how easy it is to avoid eating it as I understand it is commonly eaten. I figure I can stick to seafood and vegetarian options, but wondered if anyone had experience trying to eat halal or kosher (as I know both these follow a strict &#x27;no pork&#x27; criteria) while in Vietnam.
 Thanks in advance :)
 ​
 Edit: Thank you to everyone who has offered advice. It&#x27;s been extremely helpful as I was really worried I would be limited in experiencing the delicious cuisine. I will be taking u/meh2280 on his suggestion that bun cha is worth it - I just got some meds from the doc so I can limit my diarrhea to just a day or two and only eat it on days where we will be staying around our accommodation and relaxing! haha sorry if that was TMI. 
 Special thanks to those of you who also translated some food names into english for me. This is going to serve me well. I can&#x27;t wait to go to Vietnam! :)

                              <span>I traveled in Vietnam in 1996. It was an amazing, awe inspiring trip. I have nothing but good things to say about its people, landscape and food. (Okay, the roads were a little on the rough side.) I wish I could reach out to those who I spent time with like Flower and Ahn (?) in Hanoi, Lan in Hoi An and my soccer buddies in Hue. I hope to return one day.

                              <span>I am traveling to Vietnam later this year and I’m hoping to get some recommendations. I will arrive in Ho Chi Minh City on November 1st and I plan to spend 2-3 days there. Then I would like to explore the southern part of the country for about a week. Hoping to get recommendations for anything South or West of the city. Cultural attractions, food, beaches, or whatever. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I arrive late in Hanoi, is there any currency exchange available so I can convert USD to VND? My US bank (wells fargo) doesnt convert to VND anymore for some reason and am not sure where I can exchange prior to my arrival to Hanoi. Was wondering if the currency exchange at the airport is open 24/7 as I will want some currency at least once I arrive. What are my options for getting VND?

                              <span>For context, it’s this video. They were like “omg haha look at the dog being scared haha so funny”. Honestly isn’t that so fucked up? Why do they do that? This is shared in my family group chat and tons of other viet relatives liked the shared video. I told them that it’s not funny, the dog was clearly scared and the man was being abusive (about to hit them with a sandal), and they told me I’m being too sensitive, that it’s only a joke…
 Why do viet people have such shit sense of humor though…

I’ve recently been looking into writing a nation inspired by Vietnam but I’m honestly having a really hard time getting the ball rolling. So I figured I’d ask here for any suggestions on reading on history and mythology as well as maybe just random ideas to help get the ball rolling. Thank you for your time!

 I saw some people spraying in Hanoi earlier today and they told me I can do it on the wall near the Waterpark in Tây Hồ but I saw its filled with really nice murals and I don&#x27;t really wanna spray over them 😂 I&#x27;ve only done this once before so I am just looking for an ugly ass wall where I can practice making ugly drawings
 Also would be interested in creating paste-ups (posters), what are the regulations on those? Can I get in trouble if I paste some art on walls around the city?

I heard that people could just buy them off. Can I just call this number 08 113? or should I report this to a local police station instead? How can I do this effectively? Any tips would help 🙏

                              <span>So, me being gay, got invited to a party with a friend. That friend of mine spotted someone we both know, that person had gotten a new haircut and it&#x27;s very trendy and flattering on him
 My friend said, look at him! I only said back &quot;Đẹp trai!&quot; My friend then gave me a very weird look, then saying that don&#x27;t ever use &quot;Đẹp trai&quot; to compliment a guy, we are only allowed to use &quot;Ngầu&quot;.
 Which is weird to me. Maybe I&#x27;m being gay so I&#x27;m not used to the normal customs and etiquettes between guys and guys. Maybe I see no problem with it but many do. Is it socially unacceptable for Vietnamese men to compliment each other using &quot;Đẹp trai&quot;, or that word is just avoided and reserved for only women to use to compliment a guy?

                              <span>When I last visited SGN in 2019, being my first time, I got caught in the shoe shine scam. I thought I was being kind when I let one guy polish and fix my shoe but in the end I got threatened by a group of them with hammers and had to relinquish 500,000d to them. 
 I’m planning to return soon. How can I avoid being a victim of this scam if they come up to me n polish my shoes again? Do I shoo them away or just resign myself to fate as a tourist in VN? Will the police help if I manage to get their attention? 
 Serious answers please! 🙏

                              <span>what&#x27;s the deal with people swarming this sub with shameless seeding posts? afaik these are pretty much against the rules of the sub : no spam, no self-promotion, etc.
  
fake account pretending to be a tourist and posting links toward their tourism website
 post contains nothing but a tiktok link with no context
 literally same as above, but youtube link to their own channel
  
this wholesome sub is the last place i want to see people abusing for their own profit

                              <span>Hello. Expat here, living and working in Saigon. Which is the best district where to buy apartment? Near the center prices are literally crazy (D1, D4, D2, D7). Which is the best outer district where to settle? Furthermore, is expected prices to go down a bit in next few years or generally will stay ‘hot’. Mortgage of banks is a big issue too nowadays, rate around 10% are literally madness to borrow any amount of money. Please give me your opinions

                              <span>Xin chào! I recently started my journey of learning Vietnamese in the northern dialect. I&#x27;ve seen a few different people say that it&#x27;s always helpful to consume some sort of media in your target language to familiarize yourself with the sounds and pronunciation, even if you don&#x27;t understand anything. This of course isn&#x27;t going to be my primary method of studying but I&#x27;m sure it would be a useful tool, especially with English subtitles but that isn&#x27;t a requirement. Does anyone have suggestions for something I could use that is mainly in the northern accent? I can listen to podcasts/radio shows at work, or it could be content creators or TV shows/movies for in my free time. I would appreciate any ideas! Cảm ơn (:

                              <span>Hello everyone. I just bought a ticket for my mother to fly from Vietnam to the US. I’m staying in the States so this ticket is bought in United Air website, fly with ANA Japan. 
 Here is the issue I have. My mother name Anh Thi Nguyễn which Anh is first name and Nguyễn is her last name. On her passport and Visa, it says Given Name Thi Anh and last name is Nguyễn, so combined is Thi Anh Nguyễn. 
 When I booked, I put last name Nguyễn, first name Anh, middle name Thi, ticket comes out with traveler name is Anh Thi Nguyễn. 
 I found out I cannot change anything. Will this be an issue when she flies with custom? 
 Thank you everyone.

 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a white guy (Ukranian ancestry and American born) and live in Southern California and I recently rented a room from a Vietnamese family. Very nice people, I&#x27;ve only spoken to them briefly but they seem really nice and it&#x27;s a great room and beautiful, quiet house!
 The wife of the family has been hard with me though...they were renting a room to somebody before that was there for 6 years, and I&#x27;m &quot;the new renter&quot; and she has been getting on my case for stuff that&#x27;s pretty obviously just to give me a hard time and probably to test me a bit and see how I&#x27;ll react perhaps? I&#x27;m not sure. She keeps telling me that if she doesn&#x27;t like me that she&#x27;ll just tell her husband and that they won&#x27;t let me live there. 
 The husband has been very laid back for the most part, it seems like she is just testing me somewhat and wants to make sure I&#x27;m a nice person and a good renter. 
 Anyway, I wanted to ask is there some kind of gift I can get for her or the family that would show my appreciation to the family for renting the room? I&#x27;m fairly new to SoCal which has a large Vietnamese population as I&#x27;m sure you know, and I&#x27;d like to get the something as a housewarming gift and to show my appreciation.
 Thanks in advance, much appreciated!

                              <span>During our stay in Vietnam, when we were asked where we come from, we noticed some curious pattern:
 -Greece
 -[questioning look]
 -Hy Lap
 -Aaaah, Hy Lap. Pyramids!
 -No, that is Egypt. We are the others, the ones with the columns. XD
 So, most usually people confused Greece with Egypt. It’s not insulting for us or anything like that but I really wonder why that mix-up was so common. I understand that an obscure, small, rather insignificant country in the other end of the world can be mixed up with other, neighboring countries. But why specifically with Egypt?
 My suspicion is that most Vietnamese have heard of Greece in history class at school. Maybe in chapter &quot;ancient civilizations of eastern Mediterranean&quot;? (That’s when Greece was thriving)
 Please help me untangle this mystery.

                              <span>Hey everyone, do any of you have specific recommendations for places to visit in the south during mid September? The weather is due to be wet, but it doesn&#x27;t deter me. I will travel from Saigon to Hanoi from September 10-31st and am truly excited. I have plenty of places I&#x27;d like to visit in the middle/north such as Hue, Hoi An, Sapa and Phong Nha. However, I lack destinations in the south that may be worth visiting this time of year, apart from Saigon and Dalat. I have searched for places to visit, but am concerned that they won&#x27;t be too enjoyable in wet weather. Is there anywhere in the south people found particularly beautiful in September? Many thanks in advance👍

                              <span>I just arrived this week and there has been some rain here and there. I heard that this can cause wastewater to run off into the beaches. I&#x27;m considering surfing at My Khe Beach but I&#x27;m worried about it being polluted. How is the water quality, should I avoid it since it&#x27;s been raining?

                              <span>just a bit confused about what&#x27;s socially acceptable for couples in public. i&#x27;ve been under the impression that pda is very frowned upon, i&#x27;ve heard even just hugging or holding hands isn&#x27;t great. i&#x27;ve seen many couples that wrap their arms around each other on motos so i figured that was normal, even if they aren&#x27;t holding on for support or safety so much as just a desire. but what about the girls i&#x27;ve seen koala-ing (had both arms and legs wrapped around the guy) their bfs on motos? is that fine? have i been wrong about what slides and what doesn&#x27;t?

                              <span>I am at work today so I gave my family my cards in case they need to buy anything (they come to visit me). I put £1000 on the card. For all days I kept receiving notifications with money caming out from my card. And when contacted them, they informed me that they were buying perfumes, cosmetics and wines.
 The annoying part is that they didn&#x27;t even spend the money for themselves. They spent it to buy souvenirs for people I don’t even know and they didn&#x27;t even meet once every couple of months. My sister bought gifts for her mother-in-law’s neighbours, my niece bought gifts for her classmates. I already bought lots of cosmetics and functional foods for my sisters and cousins at home so there isn&#x27;t much they need to buy. I already covered the expenses of the whole trip, so with this It feels like I am even paying for people who didn&#x27;t even do anything for my life.
 The culture of buying gifts for everyone when travelling is something I couldn&#x27;t understand. They didn&#x27;t even contribute one penny when we work our ashes out to afford holiday. Why do we have to buy them gifts when we enjoy the sweet fruit of our labour?

                              <span>I feel like Ao Dao is very flattering on male figures and body shapes. It could hide your skinny frame well if you&#x27;re underweight. It could also hide well your belly fat if you happened to be overweight.
 The only drawback I could think of is the inconveniences and it being impractical? But I feel like the office uniform of white shirt tucked in is not exactly comfortable either, the tucked-in could easily be ruined if you move around too much too

                              <span>I will be traveling around Vietnam for 3 weeks and will be there during the Mid-Autumn Festival. I hear it&#x27;s mostly for children so is it worth it to plan my trip around the holiday or not. What is the best city to be in to experience the festival? I am debating between Hoi An, Hue, or Hanoi.
 Would love to know any other tips or suggestions for the holiday. 
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi, as the title suggests. A bit about myself: I&#x27;m a female located in HCMC and currently working as a Data Analyst. I have a knack for drawing and I&#x27;m working as a freelance 3D artist.
 The game titles I often play:
  
League of Legends (Mostly in Aram mode, I&#x27;ve reached Grandmaster rank as an ADC)
 Valorant
 Honkai Star Rail
 Genshin Impact
 I can play various games on Steam that support co-op mode.
 I&#x27;m fond of narrative-driven games like Cyberpunk 2077, Batman Trilogy, Final Fantasy...
  
I use Discord and I prefer playing games at home.
 I hope to find someone who would like to play with me after stressful working hours. 
 I am indeed a real girl. I&#x27;m not transgender or anything like that. It&#x27;s just that my gaming hobby and skills aren&#x27;t common in my job and profession. I&#x27;m also pursuing a master&#x27;s degree, so I don&#x27;t have time to find gaming buddies. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money to hire gaming partners, but I&#x27;ve realized that those relationships can be quite toxic.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have come to understand that Vietnam has very strict laws against the usage of marijuana, but that these laws are rarely enforced. I am a foreigner - an American, and the situation is much the same in many parts of the country here. In addition to this, there has been a fairly constant push amongst some people to legalize marijuana here, and it seems likely to me that it will be made federally legal some time in the relatively near future (though I don&#x27;t think the country is quite there yet). I was curious if it is the same for Vietnam - what is the general sentiment on marijuana laws? Do you believe marijuana should be legal in Vietnam, and do you think it will be soon, or do you think the current laws will remain in place for the foreseeable future, and why?

 My brother-in-law (26M) has been dating this Vietnamese girl (27F) for almost a year now. I’m a Vietnamese myself so it’s not a racial targeted post.
 Well… When they first started dating, I’ve noticed some red flags in the stories he told me and my husband about. Since maybe he was just trying to vent to us, I’m not gonna mention them. But that’s when I began to have bad feelings about this girl.
 A month or two into them seeing each other, he found out that she’s actually STILL MARRIED to another man and had a kid with him. When they met up to talk about it, she explained that her husband had a child with another …</span>

 It is &quot;You&#x27;re my serendipity, I wasn&#x27;t looking for you, I wasn&#x27;t expecting you, But I am very lucky that i met you.&quot;
 Preferably in a endearing way. MUCH THANKS TO WHOEVER CAN HELP!

                              <span>I’m a foodie and would love to eat at Saigon’s only Michelin starred restaurant on my next trip. However, the Google reviews are rather lackluster. What are the VN foodies thoughts on this place? Normally $80-$125 tasting menu pricing isn’t that big of a deal in the west, but I feel I can better spend that money elsewhere. I had the million Dong pho from LM81 and thought it was a solid 7/10, but wouldn’t go out of my way to eat there again. 
 Also, how far in advance do I need to make reservations? Thank you.

                              <span>I was happy that this one area has sidewalks for people to walk. I just saw this announcement that parking spaces are going to be designated on sidewalks.
 Looks like they generously spared around 30cm of space between the sidewalk and the grass.

I see these types of slides everywhere and they seem to be the most common type / style worn by people here. Do they have a specific name? Where can I purchase a pair?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am planning my trip to vietnam next month. I will go with one of my friend which is VN. We will stay in his village (Đức thắng mộ Đức quảng Ngãi)for one week at his parents house.
 Problem is: he told me that in the past the military have forbidden foreingers to stay and sleep the night in this village. Apparently for &#x27;security&#x27; reason because of some military zone nearby. We would have to book hotel nearby and visit his family during the day. Problem is that I do not find any official information on this interdiction and what are the exact restrictions. I would like to know the laws/rules so that I am not putting myself into problems.
 Questions: Are you aware of any official restrictions for foreigners in certain part of vietnam? Any forbiden place or activity related to military area?

                              <span>Hi, everyone!
 I am very excited to be going to Vietnam for the first time on October 5th of this year. I am meeting my best friend who&#x27;s been living in Germany for the last 8 months. It&#x27;s going to be a fairly quick trip, and neither of us knows the best way to go about it.
 As it stands, we are meeting in HCM and we have a total of 16 days before I need to fly back from HCM to Australia on the 21st. Currently, we&#x27;re thinking of spending 8 days in HCM and then another 8 days in Hanoi, as Google says Hoi An will have bad weather. I wouldn&#x27;t mind going to Sapa as that looks good too, but I&#x27;m at a complete loss as to what to do and where to go.
 I have some general concerns as this will be my first time overseas from Australia and im not too sure what to expect. 
 with that out the way the only solid plans I have are landing in HCM on the 5th of Oct and flying out on the night of the 21st. Any advice would be appreciated. Also, I just want to make sure I don&#x27;t make any rookie travel mistakes during that time. I know there are massive differences in weather across the country during that period and Im mostly just looking to find the driest / sunniest place to go that time of year. Apologies in advance im just a bit confused as every website I see gives different advice and wildly different weather predictions. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’ll admit that living in Korea as an expat has its share of problems too, but it’s pretty neat for the most part . When I visited Vietnam a month ago, I thought people were mostly friendly, ( although a Belgian traveler I met said that he was denied entry to restaurants on a couple of occasions ) and the country was far more beautiful ( nature ) than I expected. Mostly the countryside in Ninh Binh. How many of you live in the countryside in Vietnam ? Do you enjoy it or does or get boring quick enough ?

                              <span>Hi me (21 F) is interested in a Vietnamese man (24), but am a bit unsure if I want to commit. I’ve been a bit overwhelmed by the volume of communication. I’m very introverted person and need time alone. Is this level of communication typical in Vietnamese relationships? He is very keen on me committing to the relationship even though I just met him. I don’t know if I’m comfortable with this style of relationship. He has respected my boundaries but I do feel overwhelmed and unsure about my feelings for him. What I should expect dating a Vietnamese man? All the guides I see are about foreigners dating a Vietnamese woman.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning on traveling to SEA next year and wondering how long 5 million VND would last me? I&#x27;m planning on buying a motorcycle and sticking around til the money runs out. I&#x27;m thinking HCMC will be my home base. 
 I&#x27;m aware I would need to do a border run every 1/3 months depending on how the visa situation develops. Living somewhat frugally, eating what the locals do, but still having pretty regular nights out on the town.
 Roughly how long do you think I should plan to stay there? Thank
 Edit: I definitely meant to put 500 million, sorry about that folks

                              <span>Need to catch a flight at 7am in Saigon/HCMC, so would need to leave at around 4:30am or 5am latest from District 2. At that time would it be easy to find a Grab around District 2? Prefer a Grab bike since I&#x27;m alone but Grab car would be fine too. Just wondering if it&#x27;s too early to find a driver, thanks!

                              <span>As an (obvious) &quot;western&quot; tourist here, I often have the feeling you cannot walk more than 50 meters without someone approaching you who is after your money (especially in cities). In principle that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s natural that a lot of people earn money from tourists and have to approach them, so I do not mind. However this leads to me getting used to say &quot;no&quot; to basically everyone taking to me. 
 Today I was walking to the post office (~20 min away) in HCMC with postcards in my hand, and someone driving by (regular guy, no grab jacket or anything) stopped and asked if I was looking for the post office and if he could help me. Out of habit I immediately told him no thanks, but afterwards reflected if I was being mean to someone genuinely wanting to help.
 Similar situations happened several times... So my question: am I being naive, is anyone offering help expecting a tip/money anyways? ( I was also asked for money straight away after someone helped me with a minor think taking 20 second, with rather ungrateful response after I gave only 20k.) Or am I being mean to people and assume they are just after money if they are genuinely nice? And how can you tell the difference?
 My common sense from &quot;back home&quot; does not really seem to apply here, hence my questions.

                              <span>Hey! I’m planning to travel to Vietnam. I do however use “snus” or nicotine pouches like velo and Zyn. I am wondering about the laws regarding these products. Am I allowed to bring it to Vietnam? How much can I bring? 
 For the record, I’ve been Googling this for hours. I’ve tried to email, what looks like Vietnamese customs. None of them has answered. 
 Do you guys have any tips? Is it legal? Who should I contact?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m staying in Hanoi for about two months to do research at VAST. Of course I am taking this opportunity to visit as much places as possible here. But since I have so much time I was wondering if there are places worth visiting that are less obvious or well known, that tourists don&#x27;t usually visit because they&#x27;re too far from the center or something like that. Does anyone have recommendations?

                              <span>They are so nice and have these big parties where everyone gets very drunk. The grandmothers are there too but they don’t get drunk. There’s always tons of food so I don’t think I should bring food. There’s always tons of beer so I don’t think I need to bring that either. Last time I brought some flowers. I keep worrying I might accidentally offend them but they keep inviting me so I don’t think I have. We live in America. I’m trying to learn a little Vietnamese but it’s really difficult—will they think it’s weird if I try to say something in Vietnamese? Edit: I’m getting the impression that more beer is alway welcome!
 Edit 2: definitely bringing Hennessy and fruit. Probably not bull penis that someone suggested.

                              <span>I am thinking of buying a house now for my Vietnemese girlfriend and baby. How are housing prices now? Are they overpriced? Should I wait or pull the trigger now? Any red flags I should be aware of when looking at houses? I know nothing about construction quality and the overall home purchasing Process . I will be grateful for any constructive feedback. Thanks 🙏

                              <span>Hi, first time travelling to Hanoi and will be renting a car to drive by myself. I have been looking for hotel options not too far from the old quarter who either have private parking for guests. All the hotels that I have checked out on Agoda that has car park listed as a facility, don&#x27;t really have a parking lot in front when I cross checked them on Google Maps. A bit confused right now on how I should go about searching a hotel that meets this criteria, or alternatively should I be looking at paid parking lots and if those are common in Hanoi. 
 Any suggestion/recommendation is highly appreciated.

                              <span>I have the in-laws over from Vietnam. Very traditional to say the least. I&#x27;m curious where some beliefs come from, like not being able to eat something hot and cold together, one example, eating pho and then ice cream after. Taking a shower after sweating outside. And last was drinking water before or after eating mangos. I tried looking for online for explanation, but don&#x27;t find much other than the mango one being a myth

                              <span>For me, it&#x27;s the best beach I&#x27;ve ever had the chance to visit. But I&#x27;ve only visited Ha Long Bay and Sam Son Beach, and Sam Son has not exactly ever been recommended by anyone, so I think my opinion might be skewed 
 I love visiting Ha Long bay. I, in fact, has been doing it all the times, alone. I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just sentimental reasons though, It&#x27;s just that have treasurable memory there. It was a very difficult time of my life, and someone invited me to go there with them. I remember just lying on the golden sand, gazing my eyes up on the blue blue sky, immerse myself into what felt like just emptyless. A big, blue sky and a boderless sea, just made you felt wanting to melting into them, merging with them, disappear into just some bubbles with them. Just plain peace and tranquillity, some tranquillity I deeply needed that time. It calmed me down, calmed my every torments down.
 From then, I always make chances to go there, just to lie on the golden sand again. I only chose when there would be least tourists, even if that means during a storm season. Storm, brings in another kind of tranquillity. 
 But I&#x27;m afraid I might be biased. I always tell people that in Vietnam, I love Ha Long the most. I&#x27;m afraid the reason I love Ha Long is not for the fact it&#x27;s actually great there. To gaze into the endless sky, any beach would do.

 I’m currently in the Old Quarter and prices for massage are pretty ridiculous and more expensive than my hometown 😂
 What’s the real market rate? Thanks in advance! 😌

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning on visiting Vietnam in the second half of September and want to get an idea of what kind of weather to expect. I tried googling it and got some very different answers so I thought I&#x27;d try asking the people who actually live there. Should I bring gumboots and a raincoat, or boardshorts and sunglasses?
 Is there a noticeable difference in weather between the north/central/south regions?

                              <span>LÊ Bình Giang (1990, Vietnam) was educated in Film at the University of Ho Chi Minh, but he wasn’t allowed to graduate because the script for his film KFC was considered too violent by the Council of Examiners. Lê didn’t give up on his project and tried to find sponsors. He won the Film of the Future Award at the Vietnamese Autumn Meeting 2013, which helped him get started. After making several short films he finally made KFC (2016), his feature film debut, three years later. In 2023, he released two movies, “Rock-a-bye Baby” and “Jackpot Island”

                              <span>Hello all, I will be in Saigon for a month and I’m looking to make some English speaking friends, it’d be nice to meet some people to feel less homesick. We could practice our Vietnamese together!
 Is there certain clubs(not partying/drinking clubs) I can join to meet new people? Or online groups or apps to use/download? How does the Vietnamese-American Center in Saigon work? I’d love to visit.
 Thanks in advance 🙏

                              <span>I am traveling to Saigon soon and will be buying seizure medicine to bring back home to the US. Is there anything I should be worried about when bringing them back to the states? I only have a script for Klonopin(clonazepam) in the US. I’d like to bring back 50 Diazepam tablets.
 Also, there will be a layover flight when leaving Vietnam to Taiwan before going back to the states. Will I get any problems at the Taipei airport?
 Would love to hear any experience of traveling back to US with medicine. Thank you all in advance!🫶

                              <span>I am viet kieu and my husband is caucasian. We adopted a viet dog /chó cỏ/ 2 years ago when she was only 3 months old. The weird thing is whenever my husband takes the dog out for a walk, people ask him if the dog was rescued, especially when the question is directly from the locals. There was also one time the vet in district 2, saigon asked us if we rescued our dog. What are your thoughts on this? Maybe I am missing something or having a viet dog is considered as a rescue act for foreigners here in Vietnam.

                              <span>I know this could be a controversial topic, but I really need to get this out there so we can hear each other&#x27;s opinion.
 I have had a motorbike driving license for 8 years. My bike is reaching 30,000 km traveled intra-city. I&#x27;ve got used to the bustling metropolitan lifestyle.
 But I cannot trust my life on the bike. I&#x27;ve realized my body is out on the open, and each day it&#x27;s like large cars are out there to get me. During rush hour, the sidewalk is the road. I cannot help but feel guilty for pedestrians who should have the right to the sidewalk, but again, my right of way is being violated by the cars too. City traffic IS deadly if you&#x27;re a biker, I cannot say otherwise.
 Why allowing such a risky vehicle to become the nation&#x27;s top chosen transport? Why putting next to none effort in enforcing helmet safety? Why aborting the trolleycars, a totally cool public transport?
 I really need to hear your thoughts.
 Disclaimer: I am not a foreigner. I&#x27;ve lived all my life in Vietnam and married to a third generation Hanoian family, whose members are exclusively chauffered or taking public transport, and advise me to stay out of traffic.

 As u all know, Trump and co-conspirator&#x27;s mugshots were finally released yesterday and i read a report by vnexpress on this and the comment section is absolutely filled with fanatic Trump supporters, which is kinda strange and disturbing to me since i expect an isolationist president like Trump will not gather as much support in foreign countries, not to mention all of the horrible deeds he had done during and after his presidency( covid response and Jan 6th, etc)
 So just how popular is Trump in this country? Are those comments just trolls or actual opinions of actual Vietnameses?

 Common solution is to find the teacher and give him a chair on the head, but after the anger subsided I think maybe there could be more civilized way to solve this?
 Plan to take him to the hospital for checkups first thing tomorrow, but anyone has suggestions on what we should do? Google only give vague advices that doesn’t help much.

                              <span>In many bathrooms, there is a sign that says don&#x27;t put paper in the toilet. Obviously if I&#x27;m dropping a deuce, I use TP.
 These toilets tend to have bad water pressure, so I got to thinking while stinking.
 Am I supposed to: 1. Spray and toss the hopefully dookie-less paper into the bin? 2. Not throw PAPER TOWEL into the toilet, but TP is fair play?
 This has been bothering me for years. 
 This is much more ambiguous than &quot;don&#x27;t stand on the toilet seat&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t spray water into the power outlets&quot;

                              <span>I travel with a family member who has four names, for example, Nguyen thi lac tran. When I book plane tickets, it gives spaces to put in a first name, middle name, and last name. Flight attendant with Vietnam Airlines gave us a hard time saying her ID did not match what I had put down in the computer during purchasing but eventually let us through. How is this name supposed to be organized when the four names need to be separated into first, middle, and last?

                              <span>Hello, I am a person who loves Vietnam very much and has traveled here many times. My favorite destination is the sea in Vietnam, and I have discovered many beautiful beaches suitable for relaxation. Here are the top beautiful beaches in Vietnam that I would recommend:
 1. Lang Co Beach, Hue
 https://preview.redd.it/pwikjgdh37kb1.jpg?width&#x3D;1350&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a1c23e31562a1a517529d1b6210d53dd76dd40f5
 This is my favorite beach. Lang Co Beach is very clean and beautiful, as well as having a wild beauty. I am a person who does not like beaches that are too crowded with tourists and are interfered with by travel companies or resorts, so this is an ideal place for those who love natural beauty.
 2. My Khe Beach, Da Nang
 https://preview.redd.it/inksi4zs47kb1.jpg?width&#x3D;591&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;d44aeb8b8290eecbb18e5bd35d44ad093bd842e5
 Although it is pretty crowded with tourists, the scenery is still beautiful, and there are many exciting activities on the sea that you can participate in, such as playing volleyball, surfing, or. I highly recommend the Paragliding service Paragliding in Da Nang. Should join once in a lifetime to admire the city scenery and enjoy the beauty of Da Nang from above.
 3. Mui Ne Beach
 https://preview.redd.it/2tzaoes737kb1.jpg?width&#x3D;2048&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6b9b48b16c9be0969a10ce85e79b64b51503ee36
 Mui Ne is suitable for resort tourism, with luxurious 5-star resorts along the coast. Mui Ne Beach will give you a feeling of peace, not hustle.
 There are also many beautiful beaches in Vietnam that you can refer to in the Top 10 beautiful beaches in Vietnam. I rate the shores of Vietnam as very beautiful, and next time I will evaluate some coastal resorts for those who intend to go to the beach for reference.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ll be visiting HCMC and Hanoi in October, and have a few questions that I&#x27;m hoping someone here can help me with. 
  
Do any of the teams have HQs or retails shops that I could visit, similar to T1&#x27;s setup in Seoul? Ideally Hanoi, as I&#x27;m only in HCMC for 2 days. 
 
If not team retail shops, any idea where I can buy some team kit from other retail shops? I really like the GAM shirts, but happy to support any/all teams. 
 
Any idea if there will be Worlds 2023 viewing parties in Hanoi? English-speaking?
 
 Thank you in advance

I’ve always had a good experience with grab drivers during my 5 week stay, even outside of using the app, so I was fine with it. I called him 20 minutes before we wanted to be picked up and he calls back 5 minutes later to say he couldn’t make it and that someone else with license plate xxxxx was coming instead. I was already highly suspicious at this point.
 The new guy calls and we get into his 7-seater car (we’re with 5 people at this point and the previous guy had a 4-seater). I show him the two addresses we need to go to and show him the price in Grab. He disagreed, stating his car was more expensive as it’s a 7-seater. He came up with a lot more bullshit ar…</span>

(Thinking like tlinh, MONO, GREY D, MIN, W/N, Suboi, Binz, Orange, Hoàng Dũng, etc.) While he was born there, he’s been in the US for a while so he isn’t sure the best place to search. Okay if the website is in Vietnamese since he can help translate. Thank you, cảm ơn!!

                              <span>Hi! I wanted to know how cheap/expensive is it to get your hair coloured in Hanoi and which are the good salons? I&#x27;m looking to do my hair in blue and purple and wanted to see if anyone has any prior experience. 
 TIA!

                              <span>So my Vietnamese friend is going to open his new store next week, and he invited me (Chinese but born and raised in Germany) to take part in the prayers. He told me because my age is auspicious and will bring good luck to the new store. I myself is not religious and the asian tradition is unfamiliar to me so I would like to know more what this is all about, thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am half Vietnamese (born and raised in US) and am trying to get in touch with my Vietnamese side.
 My mother fled from the war when she was very young, so a lot of our family’s traditions and cultures have been lost on my side. 
 A lot of my female family wears jade wrist bangles and other jade jewelry. I was wondering if there is something similar to this permanent jewelry that men wear? I love the idea of wearing a jade bangle, but from my understanding it is something meant for women rather than me. I was unable to find information about this topic from Google, so I am asking here. 
 Thanks!

I’ll be in SEA for three months and, to me, that sounds excessive. Is this a necessary precaution or is there another option?

 It&#x27;s good to see mental health getting a little attention lately. What are your thoughts? For example, is there enough of the right kind of mental health care?

                              <span>Hi all, planning to possibly relocate from the Philippines to Vietnam. However, I have a snubnosed dog which has to fly in cabin. I noticed that Vietnam Airlines is a possibility, but they don’t fly from Manila it seems (only codeshare).
 Does anyone have a solution? Would even consider by sea.

 Thoughts and recommendations? 
 My partner has never been to Vietnam so I think she would benefit from at least dipping her toes.

                              <span>I&#x27;m really feeling exhausted with ESL, I&#x27;ve been doing it for 10 years and would merely label my talent as &#x27;capable&#x27;. I don&#x27;t particularly wish to pursue a management position. I&#x27;m in a 4 year relationship and I can&#x27;t bring myself to commit simply because I don&#x27;t want to do this job for the rest of my life. I make about 10 bucks more an hour than when I first started which doesn&#x27;t even make up for inflation.
 I&#x27;m willing to learn a new skill and study but I just don&#x27;t know what other career paths are available to expats here. For the most part, I realise that many non specialist occupations can be filled by a native who will work cheaper than I will. My observation is also that a lot of Western businesses shut down after a year leading me to think that the govt doesn&#x27;t make foreign business ownership easy.
 My question is what do I need to do to qualify myself for a job which will pay me enough to stay here? What industries can I be considering if I were to reskill?

                              <span>I’m not a Buddhist practitioner. I don’t go to temple. That being said I would like to start a discussion about monks from an observational pov. I frequent vegetarian places from bình dân food to restaurants like Bà Xã and I would frequently see monks. Nothing that sounds out of the ordinary, right? Most of the time I’ll see monks that would dine in pairs, usually eating in silence. Then there are groups of normies who accompany the monks, and sometimes one man or one woman with a monk. And this is a one time occurrence that I’ve had a friend tell me, he saw a ‘monk’ bring into a vegetarian restaurant his ‘ghệ’ and sneak in beer. He and his lover were kicked out of the establishment.
 So….. I guess I’m curious of a few things. Is it important for some people to want to build a rapport with monks? Is treating them to dinner a part of gaining good merit or something? And just how many monks out there are genuine, fraudulent, or in between with questionable morals?

                              <span>I noticed that both male and female Vietnamese seems to prefer women to be very slender. I met Vietnamese in Vietnam and in North America that prefer it when the collarbone is exposed. Seen guys deem women who were fit, to be too fat. I&#x27;m talking about an athletic girl with muscle where fat doesn&#x27;t seem to be the appropriate adjective to use. Have seen the obsession by women to have pale skin. I really want to know if guys don&#x27;t like women with curves. The hour glass shape seems to be surpassed by a slender and more modest silhouette. Just curious to know peoples honest and personal opinions along with what they believe to be the national standard.

                              <span>I am going to be in HCMC in a couple of days. Haven&#x27;t booked anything yet because I figured I could just walk into a hotel and book a room. It&#x27;s what I did 14 years ago but it just dawned on me that things may have changed. 
 I would like to stay as close to the clubs as possible so that I can stumble into bed after a drunken night out.
 Any suggestions appreciated. Aiming for $70 USD per night.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Sorry for the tourist post, but I tried asking in the stickied post yesterday and didn&#x27;t get any responses. I have recently decided to come and visit Vietnam for about 10 days and I have a few questions I thought I should ask before I arrive.
 My plan so far is to fly in to HCM for a couple of days, then head up through Hoi An/Da Nang/Hue, before moving on to Hanoi and possibly Ha Long.
 I know I can fly between HCM/Da Nang/Hanoi, but what would be the best way to get between Hoi An/Da Nang/Hue? Also between Hanoi and Ha Long?
 How different are HCM and Hanoi? Are they both worth the same amount of time?
 What is the public transport like in the cities? What is the best way to get around?
 What kind of weather can I expect during September?
 I obviously still want to be able to use my phone for internet while I&#x27;m over there. What&#x27;s a good sim card option for tourists?
 Even though I&#x27;m bound to visit some bars during my stay, I&#x27;m not much of a drinker anymore. Is there anything else that&#x27;s good to do at night in these locations that doesn&#x27;t necessarily involve drinking?
 What should I expect to pay for things like food and drinks?
 What&#x27;s the best way to see Ha Long?
 Is there any other advice you have for a solo tourist that might not be obvious to foreigners?
 Anyone want to hang out with a random Australian passing through?
 I did have some other questions, but I&#x27;ve forgotten them. Will update as I remember. 
 Thanks for your help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m visiting Viet Nam for the first time as an adult and I noticed my cousin is sniffing oil (dầu)? He says it&#x27;s to feel healthy(khỏe) and didn&#x27;t explain further. I couldnt find anything online. Is it like a mini vape pen or to help curb cigarette addiction?

                              <span>Hey everybody, I&#x27;m moving from the usa to Vietnam in about a month and a half. I&#x27;ll be staying in vung tau but i have so many questions, how do i overcome the language barrier and how bad is it? How do i go about setting up mobile service and can it take international calls? Do i rent a car or use grab? How are the gyms out there, are steroids legal as i am on trt? I see some really spiteful posts on here about foreigners and some really nice ones, what&#x27;s the general sentiment of Americans looking to migrate to Vietnam?
 Anything else i missed or should know? I&#x27;ve also got a dog, out here i take him on walks, shopping, to cafes with me, etc, is that acceptable there?

                              <span>Every post is just things that are bad everywhere and often worse in many other parts of the world - dirty bathrooms, unhelpful landlords, an education system that doesn&#x27;t prepare you well for the real world - congrats you just described every country on earth, but just add &quot;why is Vietnam like this&quot; at the end... 
 Can we get back to posting cool outings, beautiful scenery, awesome food shots, and other things that are unique to Vietnam and are huge parts of what make Vietnam such an amazing place? The negativity towards problems that exist all over is tiring.

                              <span>I’m an American who moved to Saigon last year, and I’ve noticed that while most places in D1 have Vietnamese names (for example Boulevard Norodom was renamed for Lê Duẩn), Alexandre de Rhodes and Pasteur streets still bear their colonial era names. Are there any other places in Saigon that kept their old names, and why did those particular streets keep their old names?

Most that I have searched are dentists that cannot speak English and they graduated from local universities. The handle English conversations with the assistance of dental assistant. Any good and qualified dentists that can do implants?

                              <span>Hi! So a little background is probably needed for this.
 I am currently living in Denmark as a sort of exchange student and recently went to a local Vietnamese place. I started speaking with the sweet lady who worked there and tried asking different things in Vietnamese. We got to speaking (it’s really funny cause our only common language is Danish, so neither of us were speaking our native tongue once we got past my very broken Vietnamese) and we had a wonderful conversation.
 At one point, after hearing my dogshit Vietnamese, but realizing I love Vietnamese food and people, she did the thing I’ve only ever seen before and invited me to her home. 
 My question is, how do you respond to this? I said thank you of course, but do people ever accept the invite? Refuse? Is it rude to go or not to go? I’m not sure if it’s one of those things people say but don’t expect a follow through on, or if it is something where they want you to come. I don’t mind going at all, but I also really don’t want to impose. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 
 Ps: lady gave me a bag of pears too and refused to let me pay. She was so nice 😭😭

                              <span>Few weeks ago, Bloomberg ran an article saying that VN is now a major game developing nation. Can you recommend me some games or game studios on Android please?
 The only game that I have and know from VN is a xiangqi chess game. I&#x27;ve only played board/chess and cognitive games, but open to try other kinds of game, just to see how good the game developing scene in VN is.
 Thanks.

                              <span>So basically near my house, there is this street food stall which I frequently visit after work to have dinner. They sell Phở and other kinds of noodle soup.
 But they also sell this dish. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the correct name for it in English, but it&#x27;s pork&#x27;s brain boiled in water and added with some herbs. It&#x27;s called &quot;Óc Trần&quot;
 So I came in and ordered a bowl of Phở. The owner nodded, signaling that he heard it. I suddenly felt the urge to eat that pork brain dish, I then spoke out loud to me, saying,
 &quot;Anh còn óc không vậy?&quot; Which is roughly translated to &quot;Do you have any brain left at all?&quot; 
 The owner looked very shell-shocked at me, looking very confused. I thought he didn&#x27;t heard me correctly, I spoke even louder, &quot;Anh có óc không ạ?&quot;, which is &quot;Do you have brain?&quot;
 The whole stall and everyone on the tables were looking at me confusingly, and the owner looked even more shell-shocked! I still then didn&#x27;t understand what was wrong, I told him that, &quot;Óc trần ạ!&quot;, which is &quot;Boiled brain!&quot;. He changed his facial expression immediately to smiling, lol
 Sitting down, I still didn&#x27;t firgure out why he and other people looking at me that weirdly. It took me a few minites to realize how horrible that could come across, lol! In vietnam, if we tell someone that they have no brain, or ask them if they have brain or not, it means that we are insulting them and telling them they are dumb and stupid! Lol!

                              <span>I moved to Vietnam a month ago for an internship. In this time i saw a few men that let one nail grow longer than the others. I think its usually the pinky finger? Now i wondered if that&#x27;s a thing, if there is a meaning behind this or of it was just an accident i saw a bunch, and then started to see more because i started to look for it.

                              <span>Like, it&#x27;s just suck. And here&#x27;s why:
  
Memorization: While memorization IS a necessary skill for real life, it&#x27;s one of the most useless one. There is loads of other skills an education system should focus on for helping students with later life. However, just look at the Vietnamese textbook. What did you see? IT&#x27;S JUST MEMORY! There is nearly no other skills. Critical thinking? Zero. Creativity? Zero. Heck, only logical thinking has some representation, and that representation is minuscule in my opnion. I can&#x27;t think of a reason why don&#x27;t they teach other skills rather than just memorization.
 Obsession over Grade: This is the worst problem by a long shot. Due to (let me check what it&#x27;s called...) confucianism, the Vietnamese people value education. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a good thing, but for some reasons, it has turned into an obsession over grade and score. And well, just google &quot;bệnh thành tích&quot; to see how bad it is. Tbh, I think it is not exactly the fault of the Ministry of Education, but it&#x27;s too popular to not mention.
 Underpaid teacher: Self-explanatory. This forced teachers to teach more in bonus class (idk how to translate học thêm, sorry) and create more stress to already stressed kid.
 Boring asf: Also self-explanatory
  
Tbf, they are trying to fix these problem, and while they are not even close to fix these, theres still some progress. Hopefully they can fix all of this in near future
 (sorry for any mistake)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen this SO many times. I rent a house, and it starts to fall apart, and they expect ME to foot the bill. Or, you make improvements on the house and they want to raise the rent because of the improvement. 
 Right now, the roof above one of my bathrooms is leaking and I need to figure that out and my landlord isn&#x27;t going to help me. I have a friend that installed ceilings in his house. When he moved out, he ripped them down and made a terrible mess for the owners to clean up. I&#x27;ll do the same if I have to.

                              <span>I&#x27;m personally half French half Thai, and me and my siblings all have black hair and eyes. I thought most eurasian people would have such features. But I know two different person being half French half Vietnamese and they both have green eyes. I wonder if it is common for Vietnamese mixed persons to get lights eyes colors ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never experienced theft firsthand before and this experience has been not so pleasant in my memory. At noon time on August 22, 2023, I parked my red Honda Wave motorbike across from Eddie&#x27;s Wok in Thao Dien. Specifically, it was a sidewalk with other parked motorbikes, so I figured it might be a parking spot, even though there were no guards. It was stupid of me to believe that surveillance cameras would deter any bike thieves. I stopped at Eddie&#x27;s for lunch and when I was done, I found my motorbike to be missing. I reported it to the authority of phường Thảo Điền and it was all that I could do. 
 I now realized that I was naive to park at a place with no security. I really liked that bike and I&#x27;ve had a lot of good memories with it. I also lost two helmets and a raincoat was on the bike. Like I said, I&#x27;ve never experienced theft before and I really hope that the police can get it back. But in the mean time, I&#x27;ve been blaming myself and the memory of the shocking realization is still coming back. What should I do?

 Is gluten free food a thing in Vietnam? If I ask for it will someone know what I mean or look at me like I have 2 heads?

                              <span>Hi guys!
 A group of friends and I booked a trip to Viet Nam on a whim because the flights happened to be quite cheap from Indonesia end of August.
 We will be landing in Da Lat which we were interested in because the city looks unique, and will be departing from Ho Chi Minh city. We&#x27;ll be there 28th Aug to 7th Sep. Currently the plan is to be in Da Lat for 3 nights in the beginning, then in Ho Chi Minh City from 3 Sep onwards. This leaves the 31st to 3rd on our schedule empty for potential things we can do. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do or places to go/stay on those middle 3 nights? Maybe somewhere off Da Lat and HCMC, or on the way between those two cities?
 For example we were potentially looking at checking Bao Loc out for something kinda off the beaten tourist path, but are wondering about how to get around within the city there. Is Grab readily available etc. 
 Second thing we were wondering about is how reliable the inter-city buses are. We could find schedules but can&#x27;t figure out how to book them online, so is it simple to go to the bus station and book tickets? How early in advance should we book them and do the tickets run out fast on the routes from Da Lat -&gt; HCMC? Also would you even recommend going by bus between cities for tourists with no command of the Vietnamese language save for Google Translate camera? We were thinking of going by bus for a more affordable experience and to sightsee/experience how traveling through the country by land is, but of course a plane ride between the two cities is still an option.
 Really excited to visit Viet Nam as I&#x27;ve never been there and I appreciate any help you guys can give! Thank you!

                              <span>Mình năm nay 19 tuổi, đang học tại đại học mà mình không tiện nói tên. Trước khi lên đại học mình đã mong muốn và nghĩ rằng khi lên đại học, tập thể lớp sẽ rất vui nhộn như cấp 2 hoặc cấp 3, thậm chí là hơn cả thế, nhưng mà mình đã vỡ mộng hoàn toàn sau 1 năm theo học cùng lớp. Số buổi lên lớp của trường mình không nhiều, chỉ có 3-4 buổi mỗi tuần. Lớp mình là một tập thể không đông, trước đó thì có 20 người nhưng sau đó vì nhiều người không theo được nên đã chọn đổi ngành hoặc trường nên cuối cùng lớp mình chỉ còn có 14 người. Ngỡ tưởng dân số ít thì mọi người sẽ mở lòng giao tiếp với nhau nhiều hơn nhưng kết cục vẫn đâu vào đó, ai cũng khiêm tốn và kiệm lời, chẳng có sự sôi nổi, chẳng cãi vã, chẳng tranh luận, lớp lặng im, đã vậy còn chia thành các nhóm nhỏ khác rồi chơi cùng nhau trong vòng đó (đa phần quen nhau từ trước), mình cũng có một nhóm nhưng hiện tại thì chỉ còn mình mình vì những người khác rời đi hết. Biết trước chuyện này xảy ra nên ban đầu mình có giao tiếp hay lại gần để trò chuyện cùng các nhóm khác, nhưng mà nỗ lực có vẻ không thành khi mình ăn trái bơ nhiều và các bạn có vẻ không muốn tiếp tục cuộc hội thoại. Không chỉ trên lớp mà thậm chí trên mạng xã hội, mỗi lớp đều sẽ có một nhóm zalo để chia sẻ thông tin cũng như trò chuyện, nhưng mà kì lạ là nhóm lớp chẳng ai nói cũng chẳng ai hỏi, vài tuần thì có tin nhắn thông báo sau đó lại chìm nghỉm, mình nói gì mình hỏi gì cũng đều nhận lại được đó là một đống bơ từ cả lớp, trong khi mọi tin nhắn khác mình đều thả tim hoặc rep lại để tạo sự tương tác 😢 biết là chẳng có gì đáng trách nhưng cảm giác quá đáng thật. Mọi người có giải pháp nào cho mình để có thể kết thân cùng lớp không ạ? Ai cũng bảo hãy tận hưởng đời sống sinh viên mà sao mình không thấy gì đáng tận hưởng hết á.

                              <span>I know this is a bad idea. But it was a miss on my end that I wasn&#x27;t able to check this holiday when I booked a flight. I was just excited to book since the tickets were on sale. 😂
 Anyway, fam and I will be travelling to Da Nang this Feb 8-13. Any tips on how to ensure we still enjoy the trip? Planning to stay longer in Hoi An since I heard most establishments are BAU during this time. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>What animals in Vietnam are not afraid of humans? In America, if I wanted to I could pick up a city pigeon or a goose in the park. Some squirrels will even run up to my feet in university, some people feed them. Is there any parallels in Vietnam, I know a woman who kidnapped a squirrel, but it was young and she let it go after a week.

                              <span>Suddenly feeling the urge to ask this question, because while the US is more well-known to be more open-minded about gender expression, I feel that the male beauty standard there is actually quite strict and harsh. 
 I only see the most buff, shredded, muscular guys being presented in American movies and series, and only them is positively presented. The &quot;nerds&quot; and the skinnier guys are often portrayed as a joke, a laughingstock. This might be a blindspot of mine, and I might be jumping to conclusion too early with not enough observation. But I feel the male beauty standard in the West, or at least the US, is very big, very jock-like, buff-y, brute, masculine-ish.
 And while Asia, or Vietnam, is said to be more conservative, but I actually feel like we allow men to be more things. The big, buffy with tan lines image is accepted. Also accepted is the slim, fair skin, quieter, smart, sweet and soft-spoken, &quot;thư sinh&quot; type. Nobody has to be big and shredded with 6 packs to be considered a man. Am I right about this?

                              <span>i am looking to do a 3 month trip between april, may and june 2024 in vietnam. however, i have no idea where in vietnam to go and want a physical copy guide to get a more general sense of what the different areas are like and hence what general area i would be most interested in visiting, rather than an in-depth description of what cafes and restaurants to visit in a certain part of Hanoi. 
 can anyone recommend a travel guide that would be most useful for this type of research?

 I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the look of the Honda Dream II while in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve seen it everywhere fron north to south.
 Google it back home (Spain) and I get lots of vietnamese results. Was this moto especifically marketed in Vietnam and/or SEA? 
 Was it marketed in Europe under a different name?
 Thanks a lot :)
