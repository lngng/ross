                              <span>Hello,
 For rides that are long and outside of the city, I plan to use a private car/limousine instead of a bus (I dont think Grab and Taxis are avaialble) . Wondering what the trusted ones are !]
 If it helps, I plan to go to areas outside of the cities like Phong Nha and drive to Da nang.

                              <span>Hey, going to ho chi Minh this summer (12june) for an internship (4weeks) &amp; for two weeks of travel up north.
 They&#x27;ve said I can do my internship whenever I want, so I can decide when I travel. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s best to travel in June 12-30 and then do my internship, or in July (after my internship)..or if there will be any difference at all 
 was hoping I&#x27;d be able to hike in sa pa and phong nha. I know it&#x27;s rainy season,, but I am not sure if this means absolutely no hiking or nature ever, or if it&#x27;ll just vary day by day ?
 :) I&#x27;m excited to live in HCMC
 I&#x27;m super keen to spend some time in jungles too--i wanted to do this tour, https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-ba-deep-jungle-expedition/ but it&#x27;s 2 grand ... Any tips ? If I find a tent and someone cool to come with me, ? 
 Would really appreciate Any advice/comments you have, and if you have any special places to recommend id be very very grateful :)
 Thanks

                              <span>There&#x27;s something about malls/supermarkets in Vietnam that makes me feel like it&#x27;s more interesting and luxurious. In the US they just feel mainstream and &quot;I go there just to buy stuff&quot; kind of feeling. In Vietnam going to a supermarket is like being on a fun trip. For example a trip to Coop Mart was a lot more fascinating than walking around in Walmart. Maybe because I was young and poor so memories were more fond?
 ** Ok so I&#x27;m probably wrong about the malls. But what about the supermarkets? Is it fair to compare Walmart, Target and Costco to Coop Mart and Lotte Mart?

 Does anyone know of where I could get a bonsai tree in Saigon? 
 I’ve seen sellers on the sides of the road in areas like D12, Đào Tiên, and a few others spots but they’re hit or miss on what they have or if the trees are real, so I want to see if anyone here knows where to snag a good deal on a bonsai tree.

                              <span>Hi r/VietNam, I have heard people getting their drone confiscated at Danang Intl. airport. I have alos heard people not getting a response from the office that is responsible for drone permits. I have a DJI mini drone and am wondering where I can apply for a permit (at least try to) and if I should be worried about getting my drone confiscated. I know there are other posts about this but i haven&#x27;t got a definitive answer yet. Thanks for any help.
 Edit 1: I should also add that I do not plan to fly in, or close to any city, police or goverment building.

                              <span>Does anyone know where I can get a dose of rabies immunoglobulin in Hanoi? 
 I just got bitten by a dog today in Sapa. I got the first dose of the Abhayrab vaccine immediately (about 1 hour) after being bit. But the hospital here didn’t have immunoglobulin. Planning to head back to Hanoi tomorrow to try and find it. 
 Thanks

Mình sợ xe to lắm, do mình nhiều lần đi trong tỉnh bị xe khách với container ép xíu rơi xuống ruộng rồi (đi trong sg thì chưa gặp khó khăn vì có tách làn container và xe máy rồi). Nên mình muốn hỏi đường nào đi an toàn và ít gặp xe to nhất. Mình nên đi khung giờ nào thì ít xe to nhất. Mình cũng không biết sửa xe, vậy trong trường hợp xe hư thì mình nên làm gì. Mọi người giải đáp giúp mình nha 😁.

I came here with a YouTuber who was doing a small meet and greet with some of his followers with the intention of scouting out new exotic fruits at markets and orchards and we ended up trying over 75 varieties of fruits, most of which I had never had before in the USA. 
 This was my first time ever leaving the USA and to be honest, I didn’t know too much about Vietnam before taking the trip. I was really just looking forward to leaving the USA and experiencing a new spot on the globe, and the opportunity to go to VN just landed in my lap. I have to say, I was blown away by your country.

Like an event, business strategy etc. The very next day you will wake up to see 10 other people trying to do the exact same thing as you!!! It’s like this everywhere. But I can’t help but think it’s a bit extreme here. 
 Has anyone else experienced this?

                              <span>Hey guys, I would like to share some Vietnamese learning resource. I&#x27;m heading to homeland in about a month so trying to learn as much as I can before I leave. I was studying using pimsleur for learning Portuguese which I have a review here. I was studying that for 6 months and I think it helped me in learning vietnamese and made it quite a breeze. Listening to the audio, while writing down everything really helps for my learning and it&#x27;s well paced. I recommend pimsleur for any viet kieus that never got around to learning vietnamese.

                              <span>I want to preface that I am not from Vietnam, but I am of Vietnamese descent (both parents were born and raised in Vietnam). Where I’m from there’s lots of people who are also of Vietnamese descent, but I’ve noticed that around 20-40% of these people are also mixed with Chinese. Is it the same in Vietnam? I know that China and Vietnam use to be on bad terms (might still be?) yet VietChinese people are so prevalent.

 2024 Tết there could be a chance I&#x27;m free to head back to Vietnam in February to celebrate tet with my family (currently waiting to see if i&#x27;m accepted into my masters program that starts this upcoming september)..
 Curious what the experience is like in Vietnam during Tết? To me it probably would be something cool and new since I never got to see it before.. but to my family over there they probably experienced it too many times already.
 Every Vietnam trip I stay in Hue and HCM city,

                              <span>When in Thailand I got full body massages once a week. No happy endings, and never had it on my list of things to try. I just wanted to relax my muscles from full days of walking, and only went to places that had signs saying &quot;no sex&quot;.
 Landed in Hanoi a few days ago and went for a full body Vietnamese massage at a parlor where the women were dressed up in everyday clothing. So I thought this massage was gonna be like in Thailand, and solely for muscle relaxation and recovery from walking.
 I turn on my back and massage was good, then all of a sudden I start to notice the lady spending a lot of time in my groin region. I thought i may have felt really tight there, so maybe she was working out some knots..
 I was wrong, I was getting aroused, and she knew as well. Then tells me she&#x27;ll give me a good massage and motions for a &quot;special&quot; type of massage..
 There was NO intentions of me getting one, and I thought I was just getting a regular massage as I always have in Thailand.
 Anyone else have this happen?? It was pretty funny looking back at it, and still no &quot;special massages&quot; since being in Asia.

 What are some recommended books, methods, roadmaps or any trick for teaching? And what do you think is the most challenging part of learning Vietnamese?
 I&#x27;d appreciate every help. Thank you very much.

                              <span>I work in healthcare in the US and don’t have any kids of my own. I have a big maternal instinct however. I’m looking to volunteer for a few weeks with kids somewhere in Vietnam, like an orphanage. I would like to help out just in nanny sorts of duties. I don’t speak the language, however. Does anyone have any leads I can follow?

                              <span>Hey everyone! I would just like to ask something. Basically, my girlfriend is Vietnamese and at the moment we are in a different country right now (different from my home country as well). What would be some sweet things that I can do for her, I mean in terms connected to Vietnam? Basically something thoughtful that would make her to remember about her country. Thank you so much in advance!

                              <span>I’m planning for a trip to Lao Cai (Sa Pa and Bac Ha to be exact) sometime between Christmas and the beginning of January. Would there be any festive activities going around that time? Foreigners, what did you enjoy if you’d been to Lao Cai that time of the year? TIA!

 Does this seem like the right mix, or should I reallocate my time at all? Thanks!!

                              <span>Staying in Hanoi and looking for a tour with transport included. Most online are 1 day tours that do all the main bits (along the river / cave / up the steps). Many of the 2 day tours do not seem much different... just wanted to ask if it is worth spending longer here or if a 12 hour tour is sufficient?

                              <span>My Viet boyfriend and I (South Korean girl) have dated for a year. We’re at the same age (2000 kids). We studied abroad at the same uni in Canada. Last year, my parents came to Canada to attend my convocation. I introduced him to my parents, and they&#x27;re really impressed with him bc of his family background, handsome face, height, education and graduation job (these things are very important in Korean culture), 
 Next month, he and I will travel to Vietnam for summer vacation and visit his parents in Hanoi. I wanna make them impressed just like he did on my mom and dad. 
 What can I do to impress his parents?Especially when I come to his family house, and we do not speak the same language. 
 Do old Viet people judge girls by their look, family background like Korean do? I’m quite confident but I don’t look like Viet girls.
 My Viet female friend say Hanoi parents are extremely conservative. Is that true?
 What gifts should I give to them? I have some high-end korean skincare products for his mom, but have no idea for his dad.
 Update: thank you guys for great suggestions. As I know from my Viet female friend, his parents are well off and live in a big mansion in Hanoi. That could mean they’re open minded like you guys commented. I’m confident in answering all questions regarding family background, I know rich Asian people care about these things. My dad also asked him about his dad’s job when we had dinner in Toronto. My boy has a brother who has a wife working as IELTS teacher. Both of them can speak English, so luckily I have more people to talk without translation and support me. So excited to come to 🇻🇳🇻🇳 for the first time

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;ll be visiting Vietnam in about a month. I&#x27;m allergic to mollusks (clams, mussels, oysters, snails) but not all shellfish. I am fine with fish, lobster, crab, and shrimp. I&#x27;m not deathly allergic - I just get a gastrointestinal reaction but that would ruin a day or two of the trip! What is the best way to make sure my food will not have mollusks in it? I&#x27;d like to have some seafood. What things should I avoid and what should I say to someone to ask if the dish has mollusks in it? Thank you

                              <span>Travelling to Vietnam this November and looking for reccomendations for a Halong Bay 2 day, 1 night cruise please!
 I&#x27;m looking for a cruise which covers the main highlights in Halong Bay, including Ti Top Island and any of the floating villages.
 Ideally the price of the cruise would include travel to and from Hanoi as that&#x27;s where we are staying.
 Budget is between £150-200.
 Thanks! 🛳️

 I was in Hanoi a couple of months ago and ended up in a hotpot restaurant. I ate something I still cannot identify. Can you please help?
 I am talking about the YELLOW balls in this picture:

 so as advice to all traveling to hcm airport, only book taxi from companies and issues receipt, but now a days vinasun and malinh counters or liason taxi handlers started to behave more like gangsters, that&#x27;s why i started using taxi companies before the exit, looks like im running out of options, except to book grab or gojek

A few folks I met along the way had warned me about Hanoi. I had bought some donuts for 50k. I did not have any small change so I gave her 500k and asked for 450k back. She pretend to gave me an extra donut and move away so I asked for my change. She brought out her purse and said this was what I gave her (50k). I had to wait for another order from another vendor and by the time I went back to her, she had already disappeared! Just be careful and use small changes especially with street vendors!

                              <span>In English, assuming you don’t know their rank (and 99% of people likely wouldn’t) you simply use ‘officer’. I’ve also learnt enough Vietnamese to know the pronouns system is a complete and utter pain in the backside. 
 I’ve been pulled over a few times by the CSGT and am wondering if there’s a polite way in Vietnamese to do the same thing.

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 Planning a trip with some friends in June from Australia. Will be mostly staying in Saigon with a stop at Dalat and then Nha Trang then back to saigon.
 We decided to opt in for the sleeper bus route but just wondering if these are best to be booked in vietnam themselves or can be done from a reputable online website. Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hello, will I be able to withdraw cash with a cash ATM card? I read online that the Vietnamese government has some kind of sanctions against chase and that ATMs will seize your Chase debit card if you try to use it.
 Why is this so complicated? Can someone tell me the best way to get some spending cash in Vietnam? Good ATMs to go to that won&#x27;t rip you off too much?

                              <span>I’ve been traveling in Vietnam for a a little over a week and was in Thailand for a month before that.
 This past week I started getting diarrhea. Not in the ill, going multiple times a day way. But every morning I wake up a bit earlier than usual with the urge to go. And my stool is like water.
 Normal appetite, no cramps, no nausea, nothing. I’m vegetarian, so haven’t eaten any weird meats.
 The first night it started was after I did a caving tour. We used our guide’s water filter straw but that was it. Also, seems a bit fast for it to be related to that? Either way, I don’t know. Just a thought. 
 Otherwise I feel fine! Great energy. It’s just that my usual daily bowel movement is watery diarrhea.
 Suggestions?

                              <span>Hi guys, Im from Australia going to Vietnam next month and will be staying with relatives so just working out how much to bring/carry per day.
 Was just wondering which note is best to have as in it won&#x27;t be too large for street vendors to provide change but not too small to give multiple notes to restaurants etc? The zeros are a bit daunting
 Also what are typical costs of things over there eg grocery, street food, etc ?
 Thanks in advanced

 I saw that there&#x27;s a seafood buffet in a hotel which is $55 usd, but is there somewhere that locals go?

Since they will pay me when the jobs are done, I want to know how to transfer money from Philippines to Vietnam. I don&#x27;t have Philippines bank accounts and am currently living in Vietnam.
 There is only one option I know is using PayPal but the fee it charges me really expensive.
 For those having some experiences, can you share with me the way how to deal with?
 Thanks in advanced.

Is it a bad idea since it’s the hottest part of the year? Any tips and recommendation for potential routes would be greatly appreciated.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad thing, i’m just a little confused and wondered if another part of Ha Long Bay is where backpackers tend to go?

                              <span>Hi r/Vietnam,
 I’m staying in HN for the next 2 months and want to connect with the Start Up and Digital Nomad community here. Do you have any recommendations where to meet people ? What platform do people here use to connect and network ? Where should I look for events or gatherings ? I’m thinking about visiting some co-working spaces, joining meetup.com events and search for FB-groups. I’m thankful for any info or tip.
 Have a great day people !

Currently looking for a hotel/homestay but I don&#x27;t know which area to choose. I want to be surrounded by street food. I want to be in the heart of the street food action. Which area should I stay in? Thanks guys.

                              <span>After my previous post here- https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/13lhuw3/pros_and_cons_of_trying_dog_meat_in_vietnam/ I&#x27;ve decided to try dog and cat as well during my trip to Vietnam.
 I grew up on a farm in the midwest of the US, and I love animals. I actually think cows and pigs are just as smart and loving, if not more, than dogs, so I realized that I don&#x27;t really have an issue eating dogs due to abuse because cows/pigs in the US are brutalized far more than dogs in vietnam (look up factory farming practices in the US if you don&#x27;t believe me, it is truly an abomination).
 However, I&#x27;d like to &quot;kill two birds with one stone&quot;, if you will. Can anyone recommend me a high quality restaurant (don&#x27;t want to eat some street dog/cat or something) that serves both dog and cat? I would like to try both, but I don&#x27;t want to go to two separate establishments to try.

                              <span>Does anyone know if I’m allowed to bring liquor from abroad in the 50 ml sample bottles(sealed)? So for the two litre allowance, can I bring forty sample bottles of 50ml? We run a boutique homestay and wanted to bring premium liquor such as Blue label. Will customs give me trouble?

                              <span>I&#x27;m Vietnamese. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of negative feelings toward the Japanese among Vietnamese people, but the vast majority of them are based on how people act today. Many Vietnamese, for example, believe that the Japanese look down on them.
 However, on Voz, I&#x27;ve seen some Vietnamese incorporate history into their viewpoint. Some people believe that modern Japanese people are &quot;disgusting&quot; because they are descended from bad people.
 I&#x27;m curious if any of the Vietnamese people here have similar thoughts. For example, should we be cautious around a Japanese person simply because they are Japanese?
 I don&#x27;t ask this question just because. I&#x27;m about to start working for a Japanese company in Vietnam, and I don&#x27;t want anything like this to get in my way.

                              <span>Hey all, thinking of purchasing a vehicle, and those mini hatchbacks you see all over seem to be what I&#x27;m looking for. Perfect for getting in and out of my small street and driveway. 
 The VinFast Fadil, after some initial research, seems like a solid option. It&#x27;s both cheaper in VN and seemingly has more features than the competitors like the Toyota Wigo, Honda Brio, or Chevrolet Spark...
 However, I haven&#x27;t been able to find any decent English reviews of the car online. Can anyone who has owned one share their experiences? Are they a reliable car? Worth the 380 million or so to purchase one?

                              <span>My partner and I would love to come to Vietnam from Scotland for our honeymoon. I know that some places are being hit with an unsustainable amount of tourism right now, and we would prefer to contribute to some ethical causes if possible. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions for some not-for-profit organisations that might benefit from our tourism / donations / contributions? 
 For example, when I visited Bolivia some years ago I joined a not-for-profit tour group that took us on hikes to see the mountains, and the money we spent was used to benefit the local communities. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone I’m a long time lurker but can’t find any proper advice on this. My partner and I are staying in Ninh Binh want to rent a motorbike to see Tam Coc while we’re here as I feel it would be a waste not to. We’re just super nervous about renting a motorbike/scooter. I’m used to mopeds a little and we rented one earlier in our trip on Langkawi in Malaysia. But Vietnam traffic is something else lol, I feel confident enough to do it but wondering what other people’s experiences driving Ninh Binh to Tam Coc is? Outside the town how safe are the roads? Thank u in advance and if there’s anything we should see while I’m Tam Coc any recommendations would be welcome!

                              <span>Despite growing up in the midwest of America, I am a VERY adventurous eater and have traveled to a few exotic places, always trying the local foods.
 There are a few things I will stay away from, mostly bugs/spiders/roaches, etc, but I&#x27;ve eaten crickets and scorpions.
 I am a bit torn because I researched that you can find dog in Vietnam and that it&#x27;s actually pretty common. I&#x27;m debating on whether or not I should try it. Is it safe to eat? Like are these dogs bred to be eaten or are they diseased street animals that are caught and cooked?
 By the way, while I love dogs, I find it somewhat hypocritical that people will turn a blind eye to the atrocious factory farming practices deployed on cows and pigs, while judging the shit out of people who eat dog. As someone who grew up on a farm, I can tell you that both cows and pigs are just as intelligent, if not more, than most dogs. Cows will actually get to know you and love you, just like a dog, so please let&#x27;s not judge people who eat dogs when America brutalizes and tortures cows.

                              <span>Hello all,
 My girlfriend is aVietnamese citizen in the US on a student Visa. 
 On a trip home from Vietnam today she lost her passport during a connecting flight. 
 Is there some way she can get a new passport in the US? She lives in Chicago so there are no embassies or consulates nearby. 
 If anyone has experienced this and can help it would be much appreciated.
 Thanks

                              <span>I’m from the US and my mom is from Long Xuyen. It’s been a dream of mine to see where she grew up. My honeymoon is in January, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to go to Vietnam especially with good weather conditions during that time of year. However, I haven’t traveled internationally in over a decade so I’m nervous for the language barrier and ideally I’d want to visit multiple cities but this seems complicated in Vietnam. I also want to see Da Nang’s beach. Is seeing Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and Long Xuyen possible in a two week trip? I’ve been told by people to “hire a driver” but Ho Chi Minh and Long Xuyen are 3 hours apart, so I’m not sure if this is doable. I was thinking of flying of Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh, but I’m not sure how that would be either. Any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I have a Vietnamese friend named Nghi. I always pronounced it at “knee” until one day she told me that’s technically not how it’s pronounced and it’s typically hard for English speakers to get the proper pronunciation. I don’t see her often but she’s visiting me this summer and I would love to be able to say her name properly. If there’s a video or audio clip of someone saying the name that would be even better. Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hi, Im a vietnamese who lived in canada for a little over 5 years and has fallen into the personal electric vehicle addiction, currently owning two electric skateboards and going to pick up an euc soon (electric unicycle). Started off as a commuting purpose but soon turned into a hobby/addiction cause of how fun I can get on these pevs especially freely going around the city.
 Id love to take my EUC back to Vietnam but arent too sure about the laws and regulation behind these things, id assume they would be on the same level as those electric moped that the high school kids used to ride on but i can be wrong. Tried doing some research on it but not a lot of results came up. I know these arent technically legal but are they like super restricted or is it like &quot;you are technically not supposed to ride them but I dont care enough&quot; kinda thing. Would love to hear what you have in mind.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, long story short, I had an opportunity to go to Hanoi yesterday and will be leaving in 2 days.
 I&#x27;m trying to research things about the country, including what to do and what NOT to do, but I was wondering if anyone could throw a few tips my way, mostly to help me avoid getting scammed.
 I have travelled to a few asian countries- Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and China (Major cities only). Is Vietnam/Hanoi similar to any of those places?
 I guess my questions would be (sorry for the ignorance, usually I research a place I go to for weeks, but I don&#x27;t really have time for this trip.
 1) Is street food safe to eat? Water at restaurants? Do you ask for &quot;no ice&quot; due to bacteria issues?
 2) What is the best way to get around? Uber? Taxi? etc
 3) Any recommendations on what to do?
 4) Shopping tips? I would like to buy some knives and sandals and cool collectables. I hear knives are very cheap and well made in Vietnam.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 My question is about obtaining my background check for Vietnam. When selecting the purpose of the check, am I supposed to select “for personal review” or “living abroad/visa requirement”? I’m using accurate biometrics, and the only advice I could find is for Korea, which may have different requirements than Vietnam. 
 I have seen that when teaching in Korea, they tell you to select personal review. However that leaves a notice on the paper that states “not valid for use abroad” or something along these terms. However the hagwons seem to accept it anyway, and I’m not sure if that’s the same as Vietnam. 
 Has anyone here used Accurate Biometrics before, and which option did you select before submitting your request? 
 In the second to last drop down box on the demographics page, did you select for personal review, or the “visa requirement/living abroad” option? I want to make sure I check the correct box during the process to ensure I get the proper results needed.

                              <span>I am currently travelling in this beautiful country. Mostly in the North but planning on travelling down South. While I have been enjoying my time here, I have Ibeen wondering if the extreme heat and heavy air pollution has been normal in the recent days/weeks. 
 Currently in Hue and from my googling it seems that it is one of the most polluted cities at the moment. Is this business as usual or do people here consider it unusually bad?
 Still, food is great, people are wonderful and life is good!

                              <span>So yesterday i met a couple of guys from my country and we drank beer and had a good time on the party street. Next thing i know is that im sitting on a random guys scooter on the way to his apartment, i dont remember his face, i dont remember him taking my phone at all. What i remember is just being very upset about losing my phone but still remained relatively calm. In a proper manner, i asked a guy in a green uniform who was nearby when it happend (i think) and it just felt like he was part of it all. 
 The guy has withdrawn more than $600 (the card was in the phonecase&quot;, do you think its possible to get this back because i am already on a tight budget... Maybe need to make police report for that and im probably leaving tomorrow. Whats even more scary is how he knew my pin-code. Something that sucks too is that all my pictures are gone. This was a big shit storm and it has completely ruined my mood and now i probably cant continue traveling as long as I planed.
 Has anyone been in this situation before? I would gladly take all tips from you guys.

                              <span>My girlfriend just got $140 stolen from our hotel in Vietnam. We checked literally everywhere that she would have put it. Gone! I reported it to reception, confronted the cleaning lady, they are trying to look at the cameras now, but say it&#x27;s stopped working. I said we are going to the police now for it. Feel real anxious and unsafe now!!! What do you reckon?

                              <span>I am considering traveling to Vietnam to see my friend. I am severely allergic to Tree Nuts (not peanuts) and shellfish (not fish or fish sauce). I want to know how safe I would be, if there are any specific restaurants or types of restaurants you can recommend in the HCMC area? My friend is Viet so she can translate for me, but I do want to be vert careful obviously. I am worried about the cross-contamination and ovsiouly nuts or shellfish being present in a dish I eat. Thank you so much for any advice you have.

                              <span>Hello everyone! Currently planning a trip to Vietnam for 6-7 days in mid June, and would appreciate advice/ opinions on my current (tentative) itinerary! I love temples, museums, and am ok with not seeing any beaches &amp; don’t mind ‘tourist traps’ :) 
 Day 1: Arrive in Da Nang + head to Hoi An 
 Day 2: Explore Hoi An 
 Day 3: Hoi An + head to Da Nang at night/ sleep 
 Day 4: Morning flight from Da Nang &gt; Hanoi + explore Hanoi
 Day 5: Day trip to Halong Bay 
 Day 6: Explore Hanoi 
 Day 7: Explore Hanoi + fly back 
 I omitted Hue just because of the distance from Da Nang &amp; really want to see the lanterns + tailor shops in Hoi An, but I am also wondering if this schedule is too packed. In between squeezing in two regions of Vietnam vs staying in Hanoi the entire trip (and maybe adding in additional day trips) / saving Hoi An + Hue for a later time, which would you all suggest? 
 Thank you :)

                              <span>Hello!
 My 2 friends and I are headed to Vietnam from October 9th to 18th. We are wanting to spend 2 nights out of the city hiking or at a beach town. We would prefer that the drive from the city to 2 night stay location is about 3 hours or so. Then, 3 days in the city indulging in food/drinks, day activities, etc. 
  
Should we go to Hanoi or HCMC?
 I did a little research and saw that it was a bit colder and slightly rainy. Kind of like winter. I&#x27;m curious about what locals say the weather is like there during the middle of October.
 For Hanoi and HCMC what are the best hikes/towns/beach areas to spend 2 nights at?
  
Any other recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thank you!

                              <span>Im currently in Vietnam on vacation. I love everything about it! But it&#x27;s been super hot, very similar to the climate where I&#x27;m originally from. I live on the coast so I&#x27;m constantly exposed to harsh sunlight. I&#x27;ve noticed that alot of Vietnamese women aren&#x27;t tanned at all, for example their hands and face are the same color and not different skin tones like i have. I&#x27;m pretty light skinned but just got super tanned cuz i was out today. Any tips on how yall avoid getting tanned?

                              <span>TLDR: i need recommendations for the best vietnamese learning/studying resources available for purchase IN Vietnam!!! 
 hello everyone! this is my first post here, but I’d really like to get some feedback on this as i just had this idea pop into my head this morning. 
 so my fiancé is vietnamese and he’s back in vietnam visiting family after having moved away about 13 years ago. he’s from saigon. 
 i’ve been trying to get him to teach me vietnamese but he hasn’t been very good at it 🤣 i’m very familiar with self studying languages as i’ve been studying mandarin for about 12 years now, so i’m more than willing to get a few resources to learn on my own and just ask him questions when i have any. 
 any and all recommendations would be greatly appreciated! specific book/show/movie/etc recommendations preferred since my fiancé doesn’t really know what to look for since he’s not familiar with modern learning resources available in Vietnam.

Have fallen in love with your country. for many reasons and no (happy ending massage is not one of them) I’ve toured VN and I think da nang is the easiest most welcoming area for a Canadian who only speaks English? My khe area. Any other suggestions? I am aware of the complications. I will be living in VN for 3 months at a time when the tourist visas are extended.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on vacation in Vietnam right now and a pretty big plant enthusiast. There are many different kind of banana plants and I especially like the one being grown here in Vietnam so I&#x27;d really like to take one home. I can&#x27;t get one like this in my home country so this is the only way. From what I know I have to carry a phytosanitary certificate for this. Now, I have a couple of questions:
 1.) what exactly is a banana plant called in vietnamese and in what kind of shop can I buy one? Most garden shops don&#x27;t sell those. They grow everywhere but I can&#x27;t just steal one, right?
 2.) for phytosanitary certificate I found this site. I&#x27;m at a hotel in Hanoi so I could just drive there. My main concerns are: Are 7 days enough time? Do I need a real adress in Vietnam? What would it cost?
 Thank you in advance &lt;3

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was planning to rent a motorbike and head up to the sand dunes. I intend to hire a quad bike or something when I&#x27;m there. 
 But I&#x27;ve seen this notice in my hotel. Is this true, should I be concerned? Or do you think this is the hotel trying to sell tours?
 I have a license to ride a motorcycle and have the right international license for Vietnam. Is this still illegal?
 Thanks. Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I have family that owns two large houses in Vietnam, one in Hue, about a 5 minute walk from Báo Quốc Temple and another in Quan Nam, 20 mins drive from Da Nang. They&#x27;re convinced that the Hue house is worth over $500k and the other house is worth nearly $200k USD. I&#x27;m not so convinced they&#x27;re worth that much but then again I lived in the U.S my whole life, so I honestly wouldn&#x27;t know. So my question is how much is a large 5 bedroom house with a store front on the lower level worth?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sourcing freelancer and I found that many businesses would like to work with Vietnam but there is no trade platform to connect Vietnamese factories to worldwide buyers. They can go to Alibaba but it&#x27;s full of traders on there. And Alibaba is expensive for small factories. Anyone that in e-commerce could give me an insight why there is no trading platform for Vietnamese factories?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Does anyone has experience with ILA and VUS I would definitely appreciate any previous experiences as my current advisor for the job is not responding back at all, and none of my colleagues can reach her either to further process me. I’m thinking I will go on their website and reapply, also apply to VUS. Any advice and experience stories is much appreciated.
 I really would like to know about the work cultures, salary differences (I’ve seen other posts and I believe they’re around the same) and how reliable both are in terms of getting people processed effectively without issues.

                              <span>I will be traveling with my family and then solo. My family is not into climbing. How is the climbing scene in Vietnam? I am debating if I should bring any gear like shoes and a harness or just rent them. Is it easy to meet other climbers or get good climbing guides? I am not looking to climb anything specific, just want to get out and climb in a different country.

 Went outside for a cigarette before booking a taxi to the local bus station, when a young local nearby comes over and asks if I want a taxi. He tells me hes a grab driver and flashes his phone at me with the app up. Normally I&#x27;d make my excuses and leave but it had been a long day travelling and I had a sleeper bus to catch to Ha Giang. 
 He beckons me to follow him and we walk past the taxi ranks to the car park. I assumed he was just parked up having a ciggy so dont think much of it. Theres a car half pulled into a bay that he walks upto and knocks on the window. Weird but I thought maybe hes passing the job onto his friend.
 He opens the door and I look inside to see two big guys s…</span>

We were staying near Binh Thanh market and there were a bunch of jewellery shops there. Strangely enough, a couple of them, I think those were gold &amp; diamond stores, did not allow us to enter and were very rude. In one such outlet (picture attached), the guard blocked our way, and just kept saying &quot;No&quot;. Not sure if they were just prejudiced against us (Indians) or was it something else. Racism is something I have never observed in oriental countries.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Canadian currently learning Vietnamese for fun, in hopes of visiting someday. 
 I am about 1/3rd the way through the Duolingo course on day 120. I obviously don&#x27;t know much, but im starting to be able to pull out and hear random peices of vocabulary if I watch the news or something. 
 Id like to start immersing myself in the music now, any and all suggestions will be listened too. ❤️ Ty kindly.
 Edit: skimmed and listened to most, đen vâu so far is my favourite. Thanks so much everyone.

                              <span>I need help with someone filling a report on a animal abuser and scammer in vietnam, this guy has killed over 20 otters and most likely sells them too. He abuses them and even gave one permanent brain damage. Hes even bragging online how much money he makes in a week but lies to his followers and begs for money everyday. He has a youtube of 691k followers, a store online, swimwear store, patreon, paypal and youtube money not to mention tictok. @tiutac is his name, if you can report him on youtube that would be great too. I would be willing to pay you and for your ride to the police station and if the police wont act i have cash i can pay, but i dont want to arrest him corruptly. I have evidence of all of his abuse and scams. He even tried to scam people out of their life savings 50k usd for a website that never existed.

                              <span>Just a friendly reminder to Americans teaching in Vietnam. Avoid Apax Leaders like the plague. I knew what I was getting into when I started but they are somehow worse than even I expected. Regardless most teachers have left the company and they are searching for American teachers specifically. On paper they offer a pretty good contract but they don’t fulfill any of those commitments. I know there’s probably a million other posts like this but I just wanted to bring it home again that Apax Leaders should be avoided altogether unless you enjoy working for free.

                              <span>I am currently in the city and am wondering what is there to do with 2 toddlers. We are currently staying in Time City and it’s been very convenient to not leave. 
 I know down in Ho Chi Minh has The Box Market and that looks interesting. Does HN have anything as interesting? Thanks

                              <span>I received a job offer to teach English with Athena education, based in Hanoi. My salary would be approximately 10mil VND per week. Is this a decent salary? Would I be able to save money and live comfortably with this much pay? It seems as though I will need to travel up to 10km throughout the city to different schools, is public transportation reliable enough to get to the schools in a punctual manner.
 I have never been to Vietnam or anywhere in Asia. Thanks!

                              <span>Basically, I&#x27;ve noticed that Vietnam&#x27;s road signs are similar to the road signs in other post-Soviet countries, or Russia. However, does anyone have any more details on this? I mean, this makes less sense than in, for instance, Azerbaijan, which was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, therefore was under Soviet control.
 Did, by any chance, Vietnam simply copy their signs from the Soviets/Russia, taking their obvious friendly relations into account?

                              <span>I don’t speak Vietnamese at all but have made a bunch of new friends while I am visiting. One friend tagged a photo of her and I with “2 ae đáng iu”. What does that mean? 
 I can’t get the exact translation in google translate but it says something along the lines of people in love. I don’t want her to get the wrong idea because we are not in a romantic relationship.

After a bit of a struggle, I shoved him away and he ran off. I&#x27;m Male, 27, and from the UK. Has this happened to anyone else? What&#x27;s the best way to report this?

                              <span>Hello, Redditor of Vietnamese. I am from India and wanted to know your thoughts regarding something. We Indians love Vietnam a lot. I know many people visit Vietnam for vacation or to take some time off, as hill stations in India have become increasingly expensive and overcrowded. I talked with a few friends, and they had such a great time there visiting and talking with you folks, so really, thank you for your hospitality
 I would love to know did you have people met any Indian tourists here and what were your general impressions of us.

                              <span>Hello there. Growing up I watched a vietnamese show with my parents on TV. I can&#x27;t seem to remember the show now and was hoping if any of yall know. All I remember is that it&#x27;s about a girl who works as a cook and herbalist for the emperor. At some point she loses her sense of taste, but continues to be an amazing cook. Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a drummer who knows a little guitar. I studied music in university but struggled with singing. I know my theory and can match pitch but struggle singing on my own. I&#x27;m looking for an instructor (if you speak English this will be easier, still working on my vietnamese). I can sing a c scale while playing it on guitar and and can fake it in d minor but that&#x27;s about it. If there are any instructors here I could use the help. I&#x27;m not trying to be an amazing singer but I would like to be able to sing backup for a rock/multiple subgenre band. If there are any vocal coaches, I want to improve my skills and am interested in your services. If there are any pros who can help I&#x27;m interested in your services. Thank you. If you offer vocal lessons please reach out. I live in Sài Gòn and can use all the help I can get. Message me if you are a teacher. Cảm ơn.

                              <span>Hi im currently stumped on what to do about this youtuber that has been scamming his viewers for years and has committed tons of animal abuse. Nobody has made a video about this guy and im really surprised because he has 600k subs, he only has about 10 comments a video because most people try to warn new viewers of his abuse. I have alot of evidence including where he visits and possibly his ID and address city, i also have pictures of his route to the mangroves he visits so i know the general area. He&#x27;s drowned an otter as punishment and gave it brain damage and it later died, he kept it locked in a small budgie cage where it couldn&#x27;t even turn around and would defecate and urinate all over itself. When he was bottle feeding it skim milk which you&#x27;re not supposed to do it bit off the plas…</span>

                              <span>Spending a lot of time in Vietnam right now and I&#x27;ve seen so many Korean tourists. Way more than other Asian tourists. So any reason for this? I know there&#x27;s direct flights to Da Nang from Korea but surely Korea is nice enough to just vacation at home instead? Is Vietnamese cuisine is incredibly popular with Koreans or is it the exchange rate? Are there a lot of Korean companies in Vietnam nowadays (meaning they aren&#x27;t actually tourists but they live &amp; work here)? Genuinely curious.

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I’ll be staying in Hanoi next week and was wondering if there are any hobby water polo teams around which I can join for training. Back in Germany I am part of our University team and I’d love to play/train/connect during my holidays. 
 Let me know if you there is a team I could contact! 
 Thank you.

                              <span>Khi xem các phim Hồng Kông, Trung Quốc cũ trên các kênh SCTV, mình thấy giọng lồng tiếng không giống với giọng diễn viên miền trong trên các phim Việt Nam chiếu cùng kênh.
 Mình thắc mắc liệu giọng lồng tiếng này có phải là một giọng được phát minh ra giống như giọng Mid-Atlantic trong phim Hollywood cũ không. Hay là cái giọng trong mấy phim Châu Tinh Trì là có thật?

                              <span>Every &quot;white&quot; tourist that I&#x27;ve seen appears to be British. I can tell because I&#x27;ll overhear them speaking in their accent, or they just look stereotypically British (lots of tattoos, women tend to be on the stockier side). Is Vietnam very popular place for British people or what?

                              <span>I have this annoying pet peeve when it comes to parking my motorbike, whether it is in front of a restaurant or in some motorbike parking that when I come back I always find my bike: 1) moved somewhere else and mashed between other motorbikes, 2) the dude is sitting on my motorbike and smoking a cigarette, 3) both 1 and 2. I’ve been living here for about 5 years now and it still bothers me til this day. If I frequent a place then I usually build a relationship with the guy and give him a little extra coffee money to leave my bike where it is and to not do the things I stated above so it works out. But, when it’s a new place that I barely go to I usually don’t have that luxury and I become quite annoyed by this experience every time. I have a little bit of OCD and care about the condition of my motorbike and would like to keep it in nice condition. It really bothers me that I spend a lot of time and money to keep it nice just for some guy who doesn’t give a fuck to erase all those efforts in a matter of 10 minutes and scratch it all up. I understand that I don’t deserve special treatment when there are other people besides me, but this standard of service shouldn’t be ok especially when it’s my personal property and I am parking to be a customer at the place. 
 If this sort of thing also bothers you, how do you deal with it? I find that most locals with old and beaten bikes do not care. But what if you have a nice modded bike or even a big bike that costs 150mil + vnd? Any suggestions or tips?

                              <span>Hi! I am returning to Vietnam this year (in a few weeks) and I’d like to find some stuff to do that’s a bit different to the typical tourist activities. I’ve booked two weeks in Ho Chi Minh City (located I. District 1) and will be hiring a motorbike to get around (not opposed to getting on a domestic flight though).
 I spent 1 month travelling around Vietnam last year and had an amazing time, I’ve always been curious around this country and the people and I was not disappointed! 
 I am a contemporary artist and work for a University of Fine Arts in Australia so I am really looking for creative things to partake in. There must be a network of musicians and artists in this wonderful city of millions!? When researching online for things to check out it seems like only the really obvious stuff comes up (I can’t help but wonder if it’s because I’m searching from within Australia). I want to see exhibitions by local, innovative artists, maybe undertake some workshops in craft traditions and music gigs by exciting Vietnamese bands! Where can I go or what venues offer this? (not interested in night clubs haha). Thanks for any suggestions ✌️🙏👍

 ​
 I dont care if its pirated websites either way changing my vpn to VN for Netflix seems it keeps logging me out of the account and unable to log back in so might as well use Pirated websites. Would Fmovies or soapdrama have them?

                              <span>I have been in Vietnam for a few months now and I have been staying with my grandma in Bình Dương . A week from now I will be moving to Da Nang. I have multiple long term plans of what I am trying to do here in Vietnam, so I will be staying in Da Nang indefinitely. I am looking for a place that I can volunteer in exchange of accommodation, whether it would be teaching kids English, taking care of the elderly, or tending to the victims of agent orange, v.v...
 Doing this will give me a chance to integrate and connect with the locals easier. This is what I did when I first moved to Thailand and also in Portugal. In the meantime during my volunteering, I would be exploring, trying to get familiar with the area and also attempting to find my own place. Will be truly grateful for anyone who has experience in volunteering in Da Nang and be willing to share and help me out with this.

Where is the best place in HCM to find this music on a night out? If you guys have raves with this music as well that would be cool. Looking to go out tonight. Cheers and thank you for your help in advance

                              <span>Hi there! I have just started my part-time Vietnamese classes in preparation for a job posting in Hanoi. My teacher recommends Duolingo for expanding my vocabulary outside of class, but friends have had mixed experiences with Duolingo for other languages. Do you agree that Duolingo is the best Vietnamese learning app or should I consider another?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello everybody !
 I&#x27;m from France and I visited Vietnam in october 2018. I loved your country so much, it must have been the best travel of my life. After that, I got interested in vietnamese culture, the food, the language, the music. I listened to popular vietnamese songs on Youtube. Not the oldschool, historically famous ones. More like the hits of the last few years.
 ​
 I remember listening to one song in particular and I just can&#x27;t find it anymore. It wasnt the best song or anything, but it bugs me because I can see the video clip in my head and it&#x27;s frustrating. Here is what I know about it : 
  
The main singer was a man 
 It was released before the end of 2019
 The clip is at night, in a big city. A man and a woman are having fun, getting drunk, playing pool. And there&#x27;s an underlying love story
 I think he&#x27;s hoping something happens betweem them 
 I think it was rap. But maybe not 100% rap ? 
  
I know it&#x27;s not much... But if it rings a bell to anyone, it would make my day and remind me great memories ! Thank you

                              <span>Hello, it’s been a few of days since I moved to HCMC, I put up in District 4 and was looking to buy some cigarettes. Asked around in the convenience stores and from the little bit we could communicate through google translate, all of them said they don’t sell cigarettes in the area. Will I get some at Circle K in District 1 or just from roadside sellers? (Haven’t gone beyond my area because work ends at dusk, and I did go out the first day after work but got spooked because got approached by different men twice asking where I am from and stuff so not stepping out in the evening anymore)

I thought i could feature a story of one person that experienced this. If any of you happen to know someone that would like to share their story, please let me know. Thanks for the help!

                              <span>We had heard to just pick up a SIM card at the airport when we landed in Ho Chi Minh. From our research we saw that Viettel was the best so we walked over to the Viettel stall to the far right of the airport when you get off and bought a SIM card. They put it in my phone and taped my old SIM to the card that came with the new sim like they do in every country when you do this. I had to ask for a sim removal tool (usually it comes with the new sim pack) and the lady dug up a paper clip (This was my first clue something was wrong) and taped that to the card as well. I’d been kinda distracted because of the full theater you have to go through with the passport pictures and then your picture and then they call in both and a live operator video chats you to make sure you’re real.

 I check majority of Fahasa bookstores when I pass them and the occasional stationery shop but I can&#x27;t seem to find this specific brand. Not available on Shopee, Lazada, etc. either ):
 I would love for any specific shop names if you know any, and any other suggestions as well! Ordering and shipping directly from the website is kinda my last resort.
 Thank you in advance! ((:

 Tôi đã thử yêu thêm vài người khác, nhưng tôi luôn trong trạng thái nghi ngờ họ. Thật tệ, tôi không muốn như vậy, đã 10 năm nhưng tôi k thể nào thoát ra luồng suy nghĩ trên được 🫠. 
 Thật sự cần lời khuyên.

                              <span>So me and my partner were walking in some park in HCMC and a guy appeared from nowhere and started pointing at my partner’s shoe. We didn’t understand what he meant so he came closer and took out a funny brush from his “shoe repair and maintenance box” and started quickly washing my bf’s shoes. We both said “No” about five times and soon there was another guy attacking my shoes. They basically took of our shoes from our feet - pretended to wash them with their super duper chemicals and glued an extra heel on my bf’s Birkenstock sandals (which of course came off after a few days and looks hilarious). After finishing their grand hard work of one minute they asked us 500.000 dongs from each of us (~40 euros in total). It’s not that I didn’t expect for them to ask money, I understood it from the very beginning but they were really good and quick in undressing us.. I gave them 500.000 (shouldn’t have) and they asked for another half. I literally showed them my wallet - I didn’t have that much. It is funny that they didn’t agree to take less than 500.000 - they were insisting on their price and I started finally showing my attitude, saying that we didn’t want their “service” in the first place and that we don’t have more money. So I told them let’s call the police. They didn’t like the idea and their hooligan leader took my bf’s shoe and threw it in the trash bin direction. We quickly vanished afterwards. So, our stupidity is not under a question mark - it was our first day in Vietnam, we were probably jetlagged and awed, and just fools. However, we indeed said “no” many many times and actually the next level would’ve been shouting, which we didn’t even consider and our politeness costed us 500000 dongs. My question is about the police - which side would’ve they taken? I assume this shoe business is illegal and we would’ve been right? But I saw so many people in forms in the city (I assume - policemen) - how come is their business still running?

 Anh la nguoi Viet Kieu! I plan to work remotely in Sai Gon for about five weeks this mid-August and spend time with my significant other. I want to understand if any modest to upscale furnished apartments in Sai Gon cater to individuals like myself. Previously, I stayed at Cherry Hotel and Apartment in Tan Binh last month for vacation. At the bare minimum, I need high-speed and a reliable Internet connection since I work in I.T., specifically software programming. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

                              <span>Hi there. 
 Looking for some advice on the above. Can be road transport and I&#x27;m not in a hurry. Cheapest option possible? 
 Thank you so much.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m planning to travel to Vietnam (29/F) landing in Ho Chi Minh City. I&#x27;m well travelled in Europe but it will be my first time in Asia. I will join a tour for most of my stay but was planning on arriving in advance to get over jet lag and relax a bit. Do you have any tips for my safety and to avoid scams? Where should I stay and what transport is best from the airport? I read about some taxi scams? I&#x27;d be happy to splurge a bit to be in a nice hotel with a swimming pool where I could meet other travellers perhaps and explore the area in advance of the tour (50-75 euro per night). Also, should I have predominantly cash in the local currency? Any generic advice would be appreciated as I&#x27;m getting nervous!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I’m going to Sapa in a few days time and I’m wondering if grab or uber operates in Sapa? I’ve been reading online that taxis there turn off their meters and charge unreasonable prices. If not, is there any easier way to travel around? I can’t rent a moto or a car to go around yet.

                              <span>For context, my partner and I live together with his parents, but we are not married. We also live in a European country. My partner has lived here since birth and his parents came here i think shortly after the war. They are both from northern Vietnam. I have only lived here for 4 years. I refer to them as bố and mẹ since I&#x27;m learning Vietnamese, and bố told me that since my partner and I are living together, it is the same as being married in Vietnam, and that it&#x27;s fine for me to call them bố and mẹ since its normal to call your in-laws mom and dad, and this is also common in the culture that I grew up in. The issue/thing that is confusing me is that while neither have an issue with me calling them that, bố always responds for himself as bố , while mẹ switches between mẹ and cô. I only use simple vietnamese at the moment, but an example would be:I: khi nào bố sẽ đi làm ? B: bố đi làm lúc (time)
 Mẹ would use the same or respond with cô. Is this a regional or cultural thing, or is this because there is no blood relation? I don&#x27;t think I have heard her use it with my partner or her daughter, but it oculd be that I missed it because I&#x27;m still learning the language. I also thought that it might be similar to how bạn, tôi is used as another exception pronoun. Do other non-vietnamese people also refer to their vietnamese in-laws in the same way?

                              <span>I would like to learn more about Vietnam’s politics. The way that the locals see it.
 However, I cannot just look it up online because what is posted about how the government works is not how it goes in real life. 
 For example this was on the official government site: The Constitution clearly indicates that the state power is in the hand of the people. The State is of the people, by the people and for the people.

I ended up making digital copies of them. 
 There are signatures on each them that I can’t make out. Does anyone have an idea of what region of VN could’ve been the inspiration for these pieces? They’re beautiful and I want to know more about them.

 My husbands and I will be travelling with our 3 year old and worried it might be unbearable for her since she’s never been to a country that hot before. Any advice of these 3 cities will be much appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am a person who lives in the USA. I visited Vietnam over the new year holiday and absolutely fell in love with the country. I visited my wife’s family in HCMC and now I have dreams of coming to live there too. I, of course, would try to find our own place to live as I would never want to burden my wife’s family.
 However, when telling my wife’s family that I want to move there they continuously tell us never to move there. When asked if they would ever move to the USA they always say no because it is boring, dangerous, and they love the life they have in Vietnam. I don’t understand why someone would tell me not to live somewhere if they would not leave that place at the first opportunity. They live a great life in Vietnam and my wife’s brother is always taking trips to other nearby countries and buying expensive things as a flight attendant. 
 I make a lot more money here in the USA, but with the rising cost of living and potential economic recession, I wish for a life that is much simpler. Am I wrong for wanting that? Am I wrong for thinking they might be hypocrites? Am I wrong for thinking I could have a much more comfortable life there? Please let me know.

                              <span>is this really a thing? from what people have told me. if your family fought for the south. the government can look up your records. if your family had anything to do with the south. they would punish your family for about 5 generations. for example, less opportunities among other things. Let&#x27;s say my grandparents fought for the south. I have less opportunities than people who fought for the north. it would be harder for me to get into universities regardless of my test scores. i will never get into politics or work for the government.

I&#x27;ve probably killed 30 so far but they keep on coming. Do you think my light is attracting them? I don&#x27;t want to turn the light off because they&#x27;re freaking me out. I don&#x27;t think I will be able to relax.

                              <span>Hi everyone, just spend my second day in HCMC and noticed many places we’ve been to don’t have prices on menus. When the bill comes it’s often strangely expensive. Don’t feel like I’ve been to overly touristy places but it seems odd to me, don’t imagine locals pay these prices? Granted it is my fault stopping in places with no prices advertised. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;m near done mapping out a trip to Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. I have a hostel for Ho Chi Minh but plan to just find places to stay as I go and stop. I’m getting a motorbike so these places that are for 1 day are just stop overs with maybe ¾ of the day for exploring, hence the odd day calculations…just want to be realistic.
 In total the trip is 29 days long but ultimately wondering what people’s opinions are at the times in these locations? Am I spending too much/too little time in places or prioritizing the wrong places? The only thing set in stone is Ha Long Bay, I’ll need to be there by the 26th day. My hostel in HCMC is also booked but was $12/night so is a wash if things change.
 The trip is pretty linear so things to an extent can be cut and put other places. Would love folks opinions cause most things I read say everywhere is amazing and I don’t have all the time haha!
 (3.75 days) Days 1 to 5 Ho Chi Minh City
 *I originally had 3 days is this too much time at 4 days? Worried Jet lag will put me out of commission for the day, but I arrive around noon my first day
 (1.75 days) Day 5 to 7 Phan Thiet/Mui Ne
 *Should I take a day here and give it to Dalat? Should I skip?
 (.75 days) Day 7 to 8 Dalat
 (1.75 days) Day 8 to 10 Nha Trong
 (.75 days) Days 10 to 11 Quy Nhon
 *Could go straight to Pleiku but have heard good things about Quy Nhon?
 (.75 days) Days 11 to 12 Pleiku
 (2.75 days) Days 12 to 15 Hoi An/Da Nang
 (1.75 days) Days 15 to 17 Hue
 (1.75 days) Days 17 to 19 Phong Nha
 *Wanted to do only 1 day but think if I wanna see the caves will need a whole extra day
 (.75 days) Days 19 to 20 Vinh or Thai Hoa
 *OR I am going to skip and take a bus from Dong Hoi to Ninh Binh saving a day
 (1.75 days) Days 20 to 22 Ninh Binh
 (3.75 days) Days 22 to 26 Hanoi
 (2.75 days) Days 26 to 28 Ha Long Bay *Already booked
 (1 day) Day 28-29 Stay Near Airport in Hanoi and Go Home

                              <span>So I was studying in an VUS English center. While in conversation with another classmate. He is joking me like hanging his hand like he’s pretend to grab a string. I dunno what he was doing and he slapped me hard (my head hurts afterwards). So guys, what do you guys think about this situation?

                              <span>Good evening everyone. Hoping this topic is ok to discuss here. I just found out that Vietnam has one of the most liberal laws on abortion. Would just like to ask if abortion procedure is available for tourist. I’m suspecting that I am currently pregnant (around week 2) and can’t afford to have this at the moment due to multiple personal problems. Thank you and sorry if i offend anyone here regarding this topic.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I want to make a music playlist or compilation for my parents of music they might have listened to in their youth. It&#x27;s both for them just for fun but also in case one of them develops dementia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. If you didn&#x27;t know, playing music from someone&#x27;s formative years can help them have clear and lucid moments if they have a cognitive degenerative disease. 
 Does anyone have specific artist suggestions and where to find them? I am in the US so I usually use Youtube or Spotify to search for music and I&#x27;m not aware of what services in VN would have music from that era. Anyway, when I have searched on google, I see a lot of articles about early rock and roll in Sai Gon. I don&#x27;t think my parents would have listened to that or gone to any of those clubs since they are from Central and rarely traveled to Sai Gon. 
 I believe it would be very meaningful to my parents so thank you in advance.

                              <span>are 3d graphics specialists and graphic designers in demand here? 
 I am a 3d generalist, mid, and thinking about moving to Vietnam and while I can continue working as a freelancer, having a local job would be very interesting and more comfortable in terms of visa. 
 I am capable of making character animations, garments, modeling and textures, can set up the environment and do common designer tasks from time to time (building a website (frontend), logo, banners).

                              <span>😥I lost 500k vnd at the gift shop. 
 I bought a total of 11 key chains and 3 magnets for 270k at the gift shop for family and friends. 
 It&#x27;s a cash only place and while counting my money, 2x100k, 2x10k and 1x500k instead of 50k, while I was checking my money but the old lady at the shop snatched the money. I just got back to the hotel after 4 hours of walking and exploring. 
 Any Vietnamese folks here think it&#x27;s even remotely possible to retrieve or forget and enjoy the rest of the trip here?
 TL;DR - Lost 500k vnd instead of 50k note because cashier lady rushed and snatched it before we could double check.

                              <span>Hey guys! 
 I am a Vietnamese international student studying Accounting (kế toán) in the United States and I was wondering what the job market is like for accountants in Vietnam? 
 Ive basically grown up here in the US, and I do not know if my accounting degree will benefit me in Vietnam. My main questions are: 
  
How is the job market for accountants? Are accountants in demand with the rapid economic growth Vietnam is having? 
 
What is the avg salary for accountants in Vietnam? 
 
Will a US degree of Accounting benefit my career in Vietnam, as I know Vietnam has different accounting procedures compared to Western procedures?

                              <span>My wife and I are headed to Hanoi (1st time since Covid) and we&#x27;re super stoked to check out the local spots to eat, both new and old. We&#x27;d love to hear your top suggestions as we always find good info from this community.
 The kind of food we like are from both local $ and mid-tier $$ (we&#x27;re not fancy people). Here is our favorite place in Saigon - if anyone knows a spot like this in Hanoi....please send the suggestion!

 Specifically, I heard there is a level / lesson 1 that costs ~$1,000 USD / ~24 million VND. I&#x27;m wondering how proficient one would be at English at the end of that? Also, I&#x27;m wondering how long it takes for someone to get through that course on average?
 Bonus question: how many levels are there in total for learning English? What is taught in those levels and how long does it take an average adult to complete them?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, one of friends loooves Vietnam, and has been learning the language for the past 6 years. He is now fluent in the spoken and written language (although he’s read a bunch of classic literature so some people tell him he speaks like he’s from the 1920s hahaha). He’s traveled in Vietnam for probably 1.5 years total. 
 The other night I was showing him this old book I found about social etiquette in the US in the early 1900s. It had very specific things like “how to write a letter of apology” or “how to help someone out of a carriage.“ As we were reading, he said, “I wish I could find a book like this about the nuances of Vietnamese culture!”
 I’ve looked around the internet, but because I cant speak Vietnamese, most of the books I find are travel books for people that don’t know anything about the country. I’d love suggestions about books written in Vietnamese about the “unspoken“ rules and nuances of Vietnamese culture.

I don&#x27;t have my prescription anymore, but I really do need to take care of my anxiety and OCD. Can I bring them to Vietnam without prescription? Would it get me in trouble and if so to what extent?

                              <span>Hi, I will be coming to Vietnam at the end of May. I was planning to do an overnight cruise in Ha Long Bay during my trip, however some of the threads have me a bit concerned. 
 A lot of posts in different forums have mentioned about the bay being extremely dirty with floating garbage in most places and smelling of diesel everywhere. Since a lot of these posts are from different years I want to know from someone who has been there recently if that is still the case? If so how badly does it affect the experience? I&#x27;m mostly interested in the views and maybe kayaking so please tell according to that. I also read some suggesting to opt for day cruise instead but I have my heart set on spending at least one night under the stars with scenic view on the cruise, are my expectations too much?
 Is it worth spending extra for better quality cruises? I don&#x27;t plan on splurging what the best 5 star cruises cost, so will probably look for a relatively cheap 5 star or a 4 star cruise. Are they considerably better than the budget/3 star cruises or if I&#x27;m not going for the top tier it makes no difference?
 Is Lan Ha Bay a better option? As long as the views are good I won&#x27;t mind a switch. If the views are not that good but the crowd is considerably less then I will even prefer it. I can compromise on activities a bit as well.
 Please let me know your thoughts.

                              <span>So far the only thing I&#x27;ve found is this place, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s legitimate since I can&#x27;t find evidence of that testing center anywhere besides that specific site.
 Maybe my google-fu is off today, but I&#x27;m struggling to find what I need. We&#x27;re just tourists who&#x27;ve been here a week and are here for a week and a half longer, so somewhere we can just walk in and take a test would be great, even if it means paying a bit more.
 So where can I get a full parasite test in Hanoi?

                              <span>Hey everybody,
 I’m a landscape architecture student at the university of life sciences in Warsaw. Currently me and a group of other students are starting work on a project of a small garden that belongs to the Museum of Asia and the Pacific. There are elements already present there that were built and funded by the Vietnamese community of Warsaw (the biggest being a mini version of the pagoda on one leg from Hanoi) that we will be designing around. I would like to ask you - what is one significant aspect/element of your culture that you would like to have represented in such a garden?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been living in Ho Chi Minh City for nearly a year. I&#x27;ve had an itchy mouth whenever I eat peanuts so I went for a test at a clinic, it came back that I&#x27;m allergic to peanuts (only low on the scale but I know it can get worse with exposure). They didn&#x27;t prescribe me an epipen but I want one for peace of mind. 
 Is this possible here? Do I need a prescription or can I go to a pharmacy and buy one? Do they even exist here?

 I&#x27;m looking for a place in Phu Quoc similar to Bui Vien (backpacker street) in Ho Chi Minh City.
 Is there a good street or place to drink with lots of bars and pubs?
 If someone have any information on this, please let me know! Thanks!

                              <span>The French believed that they could overwhelm the Vietnamese by air, as they had no anti aircraft capability. However the Viet Minh managed to move their artillery over the hills, dug tunnels in mountains, and effectively countered the French battery fire.
 Marked by heavy trench to trench combat, much like in WW1, howevet the Viet Minh&#x27;s anti aircraft artillery, ensured the French aircraft could not resupply the besieged garrison, and after 2 months it finally fell.

                              <span>I’ll go first:
  
How easy it is to organise service: getting wifi set up, a couch delivered, Grab food. Everything is so quick!
 
In my opinion, people are kinder in Vietnam. There’s something about the way people interact and occupy space which seems more collegial. 
 
The cost of living is so much less oppressive. I know it’s a privilege to be able to say that. 
 
 I’ve been here since 2015, living and working full-time. So, before anyone asks if I’m in expat honeymoon phase…nope.

                              <span>Last year, I visited Vietnam and got this great face wash in the store when I forgot to bring my own. I didn&#x27;t get to buy more before leaving, and now I want to buy a good amount and ship it to the U.S. However, all of the websites that I found selling the same face wash only ship within Vietnam. Does anyone know any way I can get it shipped to the U.S.? Alternatively, is there a similar face wash I can get in the U.S.? A lot of the U.S. brands are really bad for my skin.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure where to start with the type of phim but anything that has an interesting plot would be cool.
 And prefer that the phim is recent around 2017-2023..
 Thank you

                              <span>I was reading an article about the oscar winning actor Ke huy quan, who was part of an ethnic chinese minority community in vietnam. He lived in a mainly chinese area of saigon and fled the country with his family after the south lost. The article mentions that “most” of the people who left south vietnam in the 70s were of chinese origin as well. This was surprising to me as i always thought it was mainly people of viet descent and maybe only a few chinese (I only know what i was told since im 2nd gen and was born way after my grandparents left). But do you think this was likely true about boat people being mostly chinese? If so why would mainly chinese people have been the ones to leave vietnam after the end of the war?

                              <span>So as the subject says… I’m an oxycodone addict - and could use some advice… 
 I am tremendously embarrassed that I’ve gotten myself into this position, but long story short - I recently sold a business to a large multi-national corporation who has an office in Ho Chi Minh. I’ll be traveling to the office next week - but am concerned about the risks associated with traveling through customs with oxycodone pills… without them I’d be going through intense withdrawals, so I have to either do the trip and bring pills with me, or find an excuse to cancel the trip outright - which would have some pretty damaging outcomes (and could literally reduce my remaining earn-out from the acquisition by millions of dollars usd).
 I’m not looking for comments on getting clean or other judgements at this phase - I have my own plans for how I’m going to achieve that once the financial aspect of the sale and related earn-outs are completed…. But I do want to better understand the risks id be taking if I travel to VN and going through customs with oxy pills.
 Can someone help clarify what the laws are? Especially for USA foreigners traveling for work?
 To be clear - I don’t have a script and when I travel in the USA I just put them in a pill bottle for an old unrelated medication. Considering doing the same here - but haven’t travelled to VN before and I’m seeing conflicting details on the web about our drug laws and related punishments.
 Thanks for your help and non judgement!

I recently talked about it with my girlfriend and we both wondered of there is a story or believe behind it. Does anyone know more about it? We are not living in Vietnam so I am not sure if it is a regional thing or known in whole Vietnam.

 Hàn Mặc Tử is also a man who really likes making poems in the new style (he will never be someone like Xuân Diệu who is just a man that adopted the French&#x27;s poems and turned it into his own style). His early works before he got lyprosy were very similar to Xuân Diệu, the newest poets of the movement. After that though, his poems suddenly changes style to reflect on the suffering he had to endure, while maintaining his love for life around.
 It&#x27;s weird, but the way he used words that are just plain visceral, and sometimes is borderline insane (his style was the crazy one during the movement). There&#x27;s a certain level of sur…</span>

 Some of you guys may know about Pro Wrestling - an art with combination of stage techniques and wrestling together to entertain people. Or you will familiarize with the name WWE, home of many famous athletes like John Cena, Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, Dave Bautista,..etc. At Saigon there was a group of many young and talented guys with the love for pro wrestling call Vietnam Pro Wrestling (VPW for short). They have trained and organized many shows to Vietnam fans. Starting from a small dance studio with 30-50 people, wrestling on mat to nowaday performing on real wrestling ring, with attendance around 200-300 people per show.
 This June 3rd, they will organized their biggest event in the year called Ultimate Collision. Beside our Vietnamese wrestlers, we will have attendance from other wrestlers in Southeast Asia. So if you guy want to experience a burning hot and energetic Saturday night, maybe take your free time to attend their incoming show. More details on Vietnam Pro Wrestling facebook page.

 Vietnam has a marriage divorce rate at around 0.2 per 1000 people or around 5-10% of all vietnamese people will get divorced. Compared to the US were almost 50% of married people will get a divorce. That is about a 10x of the rate in US. Anyone has some light to shed on the reason why this is the case? Comment from article. 
  
Lowest Divorce Rate in the World Vietnam possesses the lowest divorce rate in the world, at 0.2 per 1,000 people. This is an impressive feat for a country with a population of over 97 million, as it indicates that couples in the region are more likely to stay together than those living elsewhere in the world. In addition to this, Vietnam has one of the highest marriage rates overall. The culture puts considerable emphasis on family and loyalty within relationships, which helps explain why divorce rates are so low. Furthermore, marriage is seen as a means of protection from poverty or any other form of financial instability as couples share costs and resources. Finally, societal norms and expectations play a major role; especially amongst older generations who frown upon divorce and may even threaten older married couples with social exclusion if they decide to end their marriages. All these factors combine to result in very low divorce rates in Vietnam compared to other countries around the world.

                              <span>I started watching some Vietnamese movies in order to practice Vietnamese and started to wonder about the type of content that can be seen in Vietnam.
 Does Vietnam allow certain amounts of gore, blood, or violence to be shown in TV shows or movies or is it really limited in what can be seen? Is nudity allowed in media or is it partially censored like in countries like Japan? Is porn illegal in the country or is it allowed?
 Sorry for the questions but I was just curious to know what directors and writers are dealing with when creating shows or films in the country.

                              <span>I have browsed on many Vietnamese forums, subreddits and even Youtube videos. Once or twice, I would see a Vietnamese netizen drop this word Tây Lông.
 Apparently this is a word used to ridicule Westerners in general, as it translates literally to “hairy Westerners”. I have seen very negative attitudes towards Westerners in communities such as r/trotruyenlinhtinh, where they seem to have a negative bias against Westerners.
 Personally I would never stoop down that low and use that word, regardless of the social situations, like even if a Western tourist was rude. But how is the word perceived by Vietnamese people? Should this word be considered rude and offensive?
 EDIT: Apologise, the subreddit name is r/trochuyenlinhtinh, instead of r/trotruyenlinhtinh, rookie mistake on my Vietnamese spelling part lol

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently residing in the US and just recently have some weird multiple toll free numbers calling me from the Vietnamese embassy in the US requesting some stuff that I wouldn&#x27;t even bother listening because I presumably though this was a scam. Then I got two missed calls from Viber, and that phone number links me to the Vietnamese embassy in the US when I search the Viber phone number on Google. Should I be worried? Is the multiple spam calling in different number normal behavior that I didn&#x27;t heard of?

                              <span>I think most people know that Vietnamese has influence from French due to Frances&#x27; history of colonization in Vietnam. But it was portguese missionaries who where the first Europeans that came to vietnam and latinize the classically written classical script of Vietnamese.
 So my question is, does anyone know more history about how the portuguese language influenced Vietnamese? I was learning brazilian portuguese independently and noticed some similarities with Vietnamese. For example the use of the ~ tilde accent mark, and the &quot;nh&quot; constant cluster sounding like &quot;y&quot;. I was able to find this article and a few comments on the Vietnamese alphabet Wikipedia.

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 Recently I am considering studying Data Analytics for a possible Data Analyst/Business Analyst job (heard they&#x27;re often strongly related), so I wanted to ask some questions about the market here in Vietnam or East Asia with a specific focus on foreigners, since I am one.
 Hope there is someone in this group currently doing these types of job here in Vietnam or in East Asia that can provide some insights.
 I have a Bachelor degree in Chinese studies, so not related, just recently completed an internship in my country&#x27;s chamber of commerce here in Vietnam.
 I would start from scratch and self-study online (I know it&#x27;s not easy but I did it before and got some certifications on Coursera, Udemy etc...).
 Questions:
 1) Is there a fundamental language barrier when it comes to the data in relationship to the country you are working in? More specifically, will the data be in the local language? / Do you need to have proficiency in the local language in order to find a job in the field?
 2) Is it sensible for a foreigner to search for those types of job or will a local professional always be preferred?
 3) Briefly, how would you describe your experience in this field here in Vietnam or East Asia as a foreigner? Positives, negatives, up, downs?
 4) Finally, do you have any tips or recommendations?
 Thought this may be useful for any foreigner wondering about their career in Asia.

                              <span>Hello- it&#x27;s my friends 25th today and we&#x27;ve been travelling together. I really would like her to have a nice day - especially since it&#x27;s a Friday too! Does anyone know anything fun that&#x27;s going on around the city we could go see/do...
 I am planning on taking her to get a manicure, go to a nice cafe for some coffee, maybe go out to Bui Vien street tonight (hopefully not too unsafe). 
 I&#x27;m thinking of whether there are any game cafes or anything else that&#x27;s activity based we could do today. Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>I live in a city is Massachusetts (USA) that has a large population of Vietnamese immigrants but I only ever see the South Vietnamese flag. Never the actual flag of Vietnam. Does Vietnam have a portion of its people that are still bitter of the unification or is it just something that is an American thing? I assume there is but Im not sure. Not sure if I phrased this question properly.

                              <span>I know reddit is not the best place for to ask for advice on life changing decisions, but I&#x27;m struggling to make a decision. I&#x27;ve booked a flight to Vietnam, which is less than 1 month away, but I&#x27;m on the verge of canceling the whole thing. 
 To give a bit of background, I&#x27;ve lived in the UK for almost half of my life. I left Vietnam during my high school years and have been working/studying here ever since. I have a good job, earning well above average wage and I&#x27;m happy with all aspects of my life here. 
 I go back to Vietnam once in a while and was surprised by how much things have changed. There definitely are a lot of opportunities there, especially when it comes to having your own start up firm, and potentially earn way more than if I continue as a salary worker in the UK after taking into account of the cost of living. That and the fact that my parents are getting old and I want to spend time with them, made me want to go back. 
 However, within the last 2 months, as I&#x27;ve been saying goodbye to everything and everyone I know here, I just feel a sense of sadness that I&#x27;m leaving my comfortable life and good career behind for something that might not work out. I feel like I might be making a big mistake. To make it worse, I&#x27;m almost certain now that my relationships with my parents are beyond repair, and we won&#x27;t get along no matter what. 
 My flight is just a few weeks away and I feel very much like just not going to the airport, and just telling my boss that I&#x27;m not leaving anymore and going back to the way it was before.
 I&#x27;m just posting it on here in the slim chance that someone might have been in the same boat and have some advice to offer.

 Something uniquely Hanoi or uniquely Vietnam. Plus points if its a conversation piece. Thanks everyone!

                              <span>I did the loop tour with Cheers hostel. On the 2nd night we stay in a small village near a waterfall in Du Gia. There were two small, cute dogs living at the homestay. I went out to smoke and one dog was chasing after me and gnawing on my leg in a playful manner, however I think he may have broke through the skin.
 I had 3 doses of rabies vaccine before travel. Should I go get 2 more?

I wonder if it&#x27;s okay when I go to Vietnamese places like Little Saigon and speak with my &quot;Hanoi&quot; accent normally there. I never been to the States before, tho, and I heard a few guys got threatened or discriminated by speaking those accent. Idk if they were just joking or sum tho.
 Moreover, how should I behave there? should I just be normal like in Vietnam or is there something I need to worry about? I&#x27;m sorry if my question triggered some of you guys. I know the history and have no hate towards &#x27;boat people&#x27; at all. It&#x27;s just i never been to The States so I really need this kind of information.
 Btw, thanks for helping me my fellow redditors, hope y&#x27;all have productive day 😁

Despite his modest means, Thực had a deep reverence for the role of food in Vietnamese culture and a compassionate heart that drove him to help those in need.
 One day, as he was preparing his banh bao for the day, he was visited by a strange, otherworldly presence. The entity introduced itself as Ong Tao, the kitchen god, and explained that it had been watching Thực&#x27;s selfless work and recognized his desire to help others through the power of food.
 In recognition of Thực&#x27;s compassion and dedication, Ong Tao bestowed upon him a great gift: the ability to be in multiple places at once, and a cart with a bottomless supply of banh bao. With this power, Thực could feed anyon…</span>

                              <span>Một ngày nóng nực như mọi ngày, cuộc sống vẫn cứ tiếp diễn y hệt vậy. Từ sau lần cuối xảy ra sự kiện đó, chúng ta đã quá quen thuộc với cái nóng và đã dần thích nghi với nó. Đã gần 300 năm kể từ khi những con quái vật từ trong mặt trời xuất hiện. Chúng ta đã chiến đấu và kết quả nhận được là sự diệt vong trên diện rộng do bão mặt trời từ những con quái vật gây ra. Trong một khu bảo an cuối cùng của nhân loại. Cương vội rít nhẹ điếu thuốc lá có thể xem là còn sót lại cuối cùng trên vũ trụ này. Vốn dĩ anh không hề thích thuốc lá, nhưng từ sau khi chứng kiến Dương, người bạn thân giàu sinh ra tử cùng mình lại biến mất một cách bí ẩn thì anh ta cũng đã thay đổi thói quen và tính cách. Ngày hôm nay cũng như mọi ngày Cương vẫn vậy. Tay cầm khẩu súng và leo lên trạm quan sát. Từ góc nhìn này anh có thể nhìn thấy toàn cảnh khu bảo an. Những đứa nhóc chạy chơi xung quanh những bãi cỏ bị cháy và những người lớn đang canh tác trên những cánh đồng khô héo, xa hơn có thể thấy những thành phố mà anh chỉ được nghe kể về thời kỳ mà con người vẫn còn làm chủ hành tinh này từ những người lớn tuổi. Bất giác anh như vô thức lau đi những giọt mồ hôi chen lẫn nước mắt khi nghĩ về nó. Rồi anh lại hướng mắt xa hơn về phía đó. Bất chợt anh thấy từ xa có vẻ có người đang đi về phía trại bảo an. Ngay lập tức anh ra hiệu cảnh báo để toàn trại vào trạng thái chiến đấu. Các hệ thống cảnh báo vang lên gầm rú như tiếng súng nổ. Các ụ súng và hệ thống tên lửa được kích hoạt, các chiến binh đều đã vào hệ thống công sự để phòng thủ. Bất ngờ Cương vội ra hiệu tắt hệ thống cảnh báo và phòng thủ vì hình như anh nhận ra điều gì đó... Hết tập 1... Mình mới tập viết truyện để giải sầu vì cuộc sống thực nó quá tiêu cực với mình. Ae xem nếu không thích thì cmt để mình gỡ nha, cảm ơn các bạn ! Vô Danh !!!

                              <span>Have you guys heard any stories from your parents about period 1975 - 1986 in Vietnam?
 The period of the “Subsidy Economy” (Bao cap) (1975-1986) has been known as a time of hardships, when mechanism for socio-economic management was inappropriate, causing privations in people’s material and spiritual life. Material life was poor due to a sluggish and inefficient production system, but the constraints also applied to people’s creative and spiritual endeavors.
 “Bao cap” was a period during which both the courage and intelligence of millions of people were suppressed and were anxious about liberation. It was a dramatic period, and a profound lesson about the law of social development.
 During this period, food, goods, and services were purchased with coupons or food stamps. Those with a position in government received more coupons and had access to special shops. For those without special status, they could expect to spend almost a day waiting in line to buy rice and other basic commodities. Everything was controlled by the government. Having a bicycle – even one that was ancient and on the verge of breakdown – was considered a luxury. If you were fortunate enough to own one, you&#x27;d be on a special list of bicycle owners allowed to buy parts (such as inner tubes, nuts, bolts, etc.).
 My parents met each other in an illiteracy eradication class. They also told me that when they finished secondary, people ran through backgrounds check (which side you supported during the war) and eventually my parents couldn’t go to high school. Can you guys share your family’s stories regarding this period?

                              <span>We rented motorbikes from Tigit Motorbikes to ride from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. The bikes were awesome. The staff provided us with excellent route options and prepared us for our long journey. The staff was very knowledgeable and the routes were incredible. The bikes were expertly maintained and had great rubber for our long journey. I would recommend using tigit for any length of bike rental, whether it&#x27;s for a day or a month. Be sure to go through their website if your having any questions regarding driving permits or route options. Thanks Tigit! https://www.tigitmotorbikes.com/

                              <span>Hello, me and my partner are planning two weeks in Vietnam in either September or early October. We&#x27;re coming from the UK and want to make the best use of our time. My current thinking is to stay in the North to avoid the bad weather in the centeral region. Would like to visit Hanoi, Ha Long, Sapa and maybe Ninh Binh or one other place. 
 Few questions: - I would love to visit Hue and Hoi An but are we right to avoid these in October? - Most two week sample itineraries cover the whole country , but is there enough to do in the North for two weeks? - Are there any other cities worth visiting in the North? - Would it be worth adding a destination outside of North Vietnam somewhere where the weather is ok e.g. South Vietnam, Cambodia etc?
 Thanks! ☺️

                              <span>Hey guys. I’m doing a motorbike trip south west of Hanoi which has been a real adventure and very eventful. The only problem I’ve had has been getting enough sleep😂. The Nha Nghi I was in on 30/4 was next to a Karaoke place which closed at 3am so no sleep till then (good for them it sounded like a great party.) I decided to find a Nha Nghi outside of town so it would be quiet and rural but a guy turns up outside at 5am and starts having a conversational chat with himself on a megaphone. Is this normal?

                              <span>Like the title says. I will be visiting Hanoi and staying there for about 10 days. What are some must do activities that you would suggest? 
 Thank you in advance. 
 P.S. Any “must not do” suggestion is also welcomed

                              <span>Before i go and buy Rosetta Stone I wanted to know what has worked for others in learning Vietnamese. I work with quite a few vietnamese so using the language wont be an issue. the initial learning and foundation of the language is what I want to get the best help with. I am a native Spanish speaker and fluent English speaker.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a pretty avid darts player and I would like to have a few rounds while in Vietnam. Anyone have any good suggestions of places that have a decent set up? Especially in Hanoi and Hoi An.
 I know from experience that alot of places that Google says has darts is unplayable..

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting ready to go to Vietnam in about 2 months and had a pre-travel consultation at my health clinic (in the US). The doctor highly recommended the Japanese encephalitis vaccine but said it&#x27;s 2 shots at $350 each in the US but it would be much cheaper if I just get it when I arrive. I&#x27;m flying into Hanoi first, but can&#x27;t seem to find any clinics in Hanoi that offer it. It looks like it&#x27;s pretty easy to get it in Bangkok....but before I switch up my plans and buy a ticket from Hanoi to Bangkok just for a shot, I figured it&#x27;d be wise to check on here and see if anyone can recommend a clinic in Hanoi that offers this vaccine. Thanks so much!

This course I&#x27;m studying called &#x27;Leadership&#x27; requires a leader who will provide me with specific feedback on my draft plan (i.e., Leadership development plan). If you&#x27;re a leader of a project/company, can you please help me out? I&#x27;d love to have your support.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard that recently some vietnamese people trying to travel or work abroad were stopped at the airport on departure for not having an exit clearance from the government. There exists similar rules for Filipinos working abroad when leaving the Philippines, a kind of archaic form of government control/corruption. Does any one have news or information on these new rules in Vietnam? Seems this is a sudden and recent change affecting many who are cought by surprise at the airport.

                              <span>It’s a very fun fact that I’ve heard from a Vietnamese person. Children in a past often said “hitler!” as a slang which means to end a friendship, this term mostly used as a joke despite many didn’t even know who Hitler was before. So do y’all know where did this come from, out of nowhere? Like a fact that people in countryside Vietnam usually names their dog after US presidents or officials involved in Vietnam War.

                              <span>I am German girl in my early 20s. I met this good-looking Vietnamese guy at university. He is international student from Hanoi. He speaks German well, so there is no language barrier between us. We hang out and really hit it off. We are at the same age, so we have many things in common. I showed signs of interest many times but he hasn’t asked me to be his girlfriend. I think I am quite pretty blonde, so he may find me attractive. Are Vietnamese guys shy to show their interest? Or they only want serious relationship with Vietnamese girls. Should I ask him if he wants to be my boyfriend? 
 Edit: we even had sex, but he keeps making me uncertain

                              <span>Bạn có biết không? 1/4 dân số trên thế giới đang gặp phải khủng hoảng nguồn nước. 
 Từ Ấn Độ qua Iran đến Botswana, có đến 17 quốc gia trên thế giới hiện đang chịu áp lực do thiếu nước rất cao. Những nước này đang sử dụng gần như tất cả lượng nước họ có, theo dữ liệu mới của Viện Tài nguyên Thế giới (World Resources Institute) công bố.
 Trong những năm gần đây, rất nhiều thành phố lớn cạn kiệt cả nguồn nước, như São Paulo ở Brazil; Chennai ở Ấn Độ và Cape Town ở Nam Phi. Năm 2018 vừa rồi đánh dấu một thứ gọi là Day Zero (nghĩa là ngày mà ngay cả những con đập cũng không còn một giọt nước). Ở Việt Nam chúng mình, bà con nông dân ở khu vực đồng bằng sông Cửu Long vừa phải chống chọi với hạn hán, vừa phải chịu đựng nước mặn xâm lấn vào sâu trong đất liền do biến đổi khí hậu gây nên.

                              <span>im a 2nd gen living in australia and i grew up being exposed to the memory of reunification day/black april in a very somber and sad way. my parents/grandparents would sometimes share some memories but they didn’t like to talk about it because i think it was still traumatizing. being born in the 2000s i never experienced it firsthand but it was always something that i was curious about and wanted to learn more about. what does april 30th mean to you? if you were a member of the diasporic vietnamese community how did/do you feel about this day? does it still hold strong emotions for you, whether or not you were there?

                              <span>Am travelling Vietnam this month- I&#x27;m a young South Asian woman (born and bred in Australia though) and I always feel like I get looked at but maybe I&#x27;m just overly self conscious about it so notice it more... But wondering if there are prejudices held. Sometimes I get compliments on my skin tone (I&#x27;m lighter skinned but even then I&#x27;m paranoid they&#x27;re secretly taking the piss out of my skin tone)... I feel anxious that the looks I get come from a place of racism/judgement, and sometimes feel like there&#x27;s a change in attitude when they hear me speak fluent English. Anyway- honesty is appreciated!

                              <span>I’m visiting hcmc for the first time and I’m just bewildered at seeing infants and toddlers on scooters. I may be a bit more concerned since I came here with my 2 yo. Has there every been like a car seat for scooters? In case anyone thinks going slower while mother holds on is any kind of protection like my wife told me. 8kg crashing at 25km/h exerts a mass force of almost 500kg. Don’t know many babies that would survive that kind of impact or know any moms who could hold onto 500kg. I understand there’s often no other way to travel in Vietnam but at least like a pod or something for the baby to TRY to escape a crash without death or permanent disfigurement.

                              <span>From the west we obviously have a reputation for drinking too much hard liquor and far too frequently. 
 But I enjoy a beer about as often as Vietnamese do. 
 That is, on special occasions or social gatherings. 
 My problem is how much beer. I like 1-2 decent quality beers and some good relaxed conversation.
 But I find over here my cup just keeps getting refilled. 4,5,6,7 beers later and the case is empty. It&#x27;s just too much for my stomach or bladder to handle to be honest. I didn&#x27;t even drink like that when I was a delinquent teenager. 
 People start getting obnoxious and getting me to say rude and inappropriate things in Vietnamese (which I don&#x27;t speak very well). And they try to make me say it over and over and over again because they&#x27;re totally wasted. 
 I miss that culture of the west where you can take part in the drinking circle and everyone just drinks as much as they feel like. No pressure to gulp down 5L each. 
 I honestly like the taste of Tiger. It&#x27;s a pretty good beer for a mass-produced brew. 
 But I&#x27;ve had to completely give up social drinking while I&#x27;m here. My body just can&#x27;t handle that much anymore. I&#x27;m only 27 but I take antidepressants. 
 I don&#x27;t like to drink alone and my wife doesn&#x27;t like beer. 
 So that&#x27;s my story. This Canadian is done drinking beer. I like the taste, hate the drunk. 
 Not meant to be derogatory at all. This is just me expressing myself. I understand every culture is different and I&#x27;ve taken part in the drinking circle once with every new group I meet just to build that trust with them. But from then on I just refuse. It never just stops at 1-2 beers. 
 Also, ice in warm beer? Cold out of the fridge man. Cold out of the fridge. Completely ruins the taste for me.

                              <span>Hi, 
 Just want to ask all the Vietnamese born abroad a quick question: 
  
Are you learning Vietnamese at the moment and what is your current level?
 What are some types of content that you think are missing on the Internet/in textbooks that you really want to know about in terms of the Vietnamese language?
 If you can already speak Vietnamese to some extent, what kind of content/materials do you think would really help you become fluent?

                              <span>I speak English originally but I would like to learn this language and visit Vietnam one day. Duolingo and the books I got are helping me understand grammar and how to read the language bit by bit, but I SUCK at speaking it, and I know I do. And I don&#x27;t know any native speakers personally anymore to help correct my pronunciation. I think I end up overthinking and trying to implement the tones but in doing this I just mess the whole word up lol.
 I&#x27;ve tried saying phrases and words really slow then gradually increasing speed til at a normal speaking cadence and this helps a bit but I was wondering if there was something more efficient. Also I feel like due to my natural voice being kind of deep/bassy and the sort of hard way I tend to pronounce things the naturally softer or more nuanced sounds are kind of harsher than the audio samples I&#x27;m hearing. I&#x27;m just really having a hard time with this because my voice is deep and somewhat monotone unless I&#x27;m excited about something so it&#x27;s hard to do the tones and when I do I feel like I&#x27;m over emphasizing them.
 It&#x27;s bad enough I tend to even stutter a bit more than usual in English too but I completely butcher this beautiful language almost every time it comes out of my mouth. And I wanna be able to speak to native speakers but not laughably 💀 I know most people are gracious and kind enough to just appreciate you even took the time but still why do it if not correctly?

                              <span>Hello, I am planning to visit Vietnam soon for my vacation. I am also interested in exploring the possibility of adding 360-degree videos of public street locations to Google Street View that are currently not available on Google Maps. 
 As of now, I have noticed that only major roads have been filmed and added to Google Street View. However, I am curious about the feasibility of capturing more street locations and making them accessible on Google Maps. I understand that it is important to respect privacy and comply with any laws or regulations regarding photography in public spaces. 
 Therefore, I am seeking information on the legal implications of such a project in Vietnam. Specifically, I am interested in knowing if there are any restrictions on filming in public spaces and if capturing 360-degree videos of public street locations is allowed. I would also like to ensure that the project complies with local laws and respects the privacy of individuals. 
 Thank you for any guidance or information you can provide on this matter!

                              <span>We&#x27;re debating foregoing Ha Long &amp; Bai Tu Long area in November because we&#x27;re reading/seeing so much about crowds and karaoke and the cruise/party isn&#x27;t our thing. We&#x27;d rather be more remote.
 We&#x27;ll be in Ninh Binh towards the end of our time and will have a couple of days we want to spend in the sun &amp; sand. Resort not necessary. The smaller - or homestay-like, the better.
 2 adults. November. Would appreciate your experience/advice.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m going to be moving to Hanoi soon and was looking for massage reccomendations. I am dealing with some injurys but have had great success with Active Release Technique (or ART). I was wondering if anyone can reccomend a massage type/parlor that does something similar to this. I know that I probably won&#x27;t be able to find an ART practicioner while in Hanoi so was wondering what the next best thing may be. For context ART basically involves hitting certain pressure points in soft tissue and manipulating the muscles around them through releases (i know just sounds a regular massage but it&#x27;s been much more effective than say Thai massages I&#x27;ve had in the past). If anyone has any ideas I&#x27;d really appreciate it, thanks!

                              <span>I decided to book a spontaneous trip to Hanoi and will land on September 15th. I&#x27;m super confused by all the conflicting information online about where to go/not to go due to the rainy season. 
 E.g. I&#x27;d love to do Ninh Bing (both Tam Coc and Trang An) but some websites say definitely don&#x27;t due to typhoons whilst others say it&#x27;ll be good cos it&#x27;s the low season. All i&#x27;ve got booked so far are 2 nights in Hanoi and have ~10 more days to plan. I&#x27;ll be flying out from HMC September 30. 
 Basically where should I definitely avoid?

                              <span>I am visiting my students in July 2023. I will be there for 2 weeks. Is there anything you would not travel there without? Id love any tips or hints. We will be around Ho Chi Minh.
 Also, would a Brita water filter bottle help with the water issue in an emergency? Thank You for any help you can provide. Thankies!

                              <span>Australian here, I visit Vietnam every few years as I have family living in Saigon. Everytime I visit Vietnam, I always experience really bad food poisoning. My last visit to Vietnam was about 5 years ago, and that time was probably the worst food poisoning I&#x27;ve ever experienced, absolute bed ridden for about a week. 
 Any tips on how to avoid food poisoning and what to watch out for? I will be travelling to Vietnam again in a few months time and I&#x27;m definitely going to avoid eating raw food, as I&#x27;m pretty sure I got food poisoning from eating raw fish at a japanese restaurant in Phan Thiet. Many thanks!

                              <span>Hey friends,
 My girlfriend and I are traveling through Vietnam since a week now, and we are enjoying it so much. You have a beautiful country and I’ve seldomly experienced such a degree of hospitality! 
 We arrived late this night in Hanoi and are now looking for activities to fill the upcoming days. If I’ve understood correctly, today is reunification day and tomorrow is workers day? Would there be any parades or festivities in the city, one could attend? 
 Thank you so much in advance and feel free to share anything, you think we could enjoy here.

                              <span>I met a Vietnamese girl and we are both Christians. Same faith. However her parents are both in the idea of that she should settle down with a Vietnamese guy. She haven’t told her parents about us yet. Just wondering if this is common , and has anyone encountered this before and what was your experience ?
 To give some context: I’m half Indian and a Malaysian, she is south Vietnamese.

                              <span>I have a job offer in Thu Dau Mot. There is not a ton of information about this town online, at least in English. I am a little worried about there not being much to do or being able to meet other English speakers and making friends. I am curious if anyone here has any insight. What is life like in Thu Dau Mot? Is there much to do for a foreigner? The only other post asking about TDM is a few years old and I was told the area has seen a lot of growth. Has anything changed?
 About me: I am a male, in my 30&#x27;s, from the USA, and single. I speak no Vietnamese, although I enjoy learning languages and will attempt to learn basics while living in Vietnam. I don&#x27;t drink or care too much about having access to crazy nightlife, although I like the option of being able to go out occasionally with people. I enjoy nature, riding my motorcycle around, and doing outdoorsy stuff.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I met my gf online a few years back and ever since then I would see her every ~8 months or so. Unfortunately, I recently found out my mom has cancer and I cancelled all my travel plans since I need to take care of my mom. Last year she tried to get a visa to visit me in California but her visa got denied. What&#x27;s the best way for her to come visit since I am unable to go anywhere for the time being? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, first time in Saigon, wanna get some reccomendations for a hotel 1-1.5mil VND a night for 2 nights, probably around Ben Thành market?
 Would like to go the war remnants museum, maybe the Opera house 
 So many options its a bit confusing. 
 Having a pool would be a plus
 Thanks in advance

 Also should I have it checked out since just in case there&#x27;s nothing really wrong with me I&#x27;d feel very awkward to visit a psychiatric for nothing

 Looking at buying in bau tram ward in long Khánh city. Where would be the best place to find available properties online?
 Not heading back across until November, so I’m trying to get a feel for the market. 
 Looks to be a few on Facebook, but I’m also concerned about the scams / fake ads. 
 Any direction would be great. 
 Cảm ơn

                              <span>Hi guys, I’m travelling to Vietnam in June with my sister and we would love to explore the Thuy Tien amusement park in Hue. Just wanted to know how safe is it for female travelers and how to go about it? Thank you!

                              <span>These inbred a-holes occasionally pull their table out in the open ,put it in the middle of the sidewalk and start to drunkenly cursing loudly for everyone to hear while drinking nonstop. These criminals from lower caste raise chickens and rooster for illegal cock fights and the roosters always crow at 2Am disrupting everyone else’s sleep .It’s sad that the local police favors these criminals since the dirty money get from orchestrating the cock fight pay the police well. Corrupted city that act a safe haven for criminals. What a sad country full of decadency

                              <span>For context, I’m an American who’s engaged to a Vietnamese woman and we are living in the US. I noticed pretty early on when she eats she tends to make quite a bit of noise and chews with her mouth open. This is something that kind of drives me insane but I’ve gotten used to it. When I met her parents I noticed her Dad made some interesting noises as well. I did gently tell her once for her own awareness that many Americans consider these things rude or slightly gross, but mostly because I didn’t want her to feel embarrassed if she didn’t know. With things like noodles or soup I can understand to a degree but sometimes it’s almost distracting. Is this just a cultural difference and do Vietnamese people have no problem with it?
 Edit: thank you to all those who provided their thoughts and aren’t so sensitive they somehow took this personally lmao, I appreciate it!

                              <span>Sorry I didn&#x27;t see much specific to Ha Long Bay or cruises in the sticky post. I&#x27;m planning on pulling the trigger tomorrow on one tomorrow. I have been doing some research over the week and I&#x27;m finding myself a little overwhelmed by the options. Anyone try these out? Things you liked or didn&#x27;t like? Was there anything you wished was available or anything that was you didn&#x27;t need or want? It seems like the activities are based on the boat you choose. This is our first time visiting the country and I&#x27;m thrilled for the new experience. Any input would be appreciated!

                              <span>Am looking to connect with exporters (shoes primarily, but also other goods/services) and business language/college-prep centers, for possible partnership/cooperation. 
 Any sugestions of contacts, websites or orgs (besides amcham) that might be helpful?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I live in South Dakota (Midwest US), and the people who own the nail salon I go to are Vietnamese. They just bought it a few months ago, and in that time they&#x27;ve sent me home with lots of different homemade dishes; bánh mì, bún thịt nướng chả giò, bún bò Huế, and bánh xèo for starters - all incredibly delicious. They don&#x27;t want me to pay for it, saying they&#x27;re just happy someone loves their food. I&#x27;ve increased my tip, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if etiquette called for something more.

                              <span>Hello all!
 I am an Irishman in Hue for the four months, and looking for a way to practice bass as I play in a band at home. So far I haven&#x27;t been able to find either an electric or an acoustic bass in Hue music shops, and I&#x27;m wondering if one of you lovely folks could point me in the right direction?
 Am I more likely to find a bass in a pawn shop? Or, if any of you are from Hue, do you have any musician friends who might have seen one for sale?
 Thanks very much!

                              <span>Anyone done ha Giang loop in July? Is it even a real possibility? Would love to do it but will be in Vietnam during rainy season. I have quite a bit of riding experience but don’t want to be overly risky.

                              <span>I saw this in some vietnamese text. But I&#x27;m not sure if &quot;yahh&quot; is more refering to the English &quot;yeah&quot;, in a informal and casual sense. Or is it a funny ironic english spelling of &quot;Dạ&quot; which the very polite interjection in Vietnamese. Or is there no relation?

                              <span>Anyone knows whether there are any atms with better/worse withdrawal fees using a wise card? Tried finding info on their site but couldn’t. I am wondering whether i should rather bring more cash and exchange or bring less and withdraw there from wise. Thank you!

 I&#x27;m looking for an English-speaking therapist who specializes in Depression, BPD, or cPTSD.
 My initial Google search doesn&#x27;t look so promising.

 Im visiting Vietnam in November and have always dreamed of laser eye surgery so I can ditch my glasses. Does anyone here have experience with a clinic in Ho chi minh city that performs it?

                              <span>Full context, I’m a tourist. 
 I’m just wondering what you think it would take to change mindsets about littering?
 Today I was sitting by a small river in Hoi An and there was a tea vendor who came over and tossed two beer cans and a styrofoam package into the water. Not even 7m from him other locals fishing. 
 And I just can’t help but wonder, does he not know that pollution kills potential income and food for his neighbors? Is it education that’s needed?
 Or is it something else?
 And I’m not judging here, I’m honestly curious about why littering is so common in some SE Asian countries. (I had a similar experience while trying to scoop up trash that kids were throwing into a river in Thailand. Which they thought was hilarious for me to do.)

                              <span>Sure the title sounds weird. We (Pirates of Tokyo Bay) are a Japan-based bilingual improv comedy group. In Japan our shows are done in English+Japanese... We will be performing in Hanoi next month (on May 13th at the Vietnam Improv Festival)....BUT in Hanoi we will be performing only in English... but for the purpose of this Reddit post, we want to try to be as bilingual (English + Vietnamese) as possible in our show. (We won&#x27;t use any/much Japanese in our show since the audience will be English/Vietnamese speakers in Hanoi).
 To help us best connect with the audiences in Vietnam, we are wondering if there are some simple phrases, slang, lingo, or even places, events, school/university, companies in Vietnam/Hanoi) we could learn and try to bring into our scenes.

                              <span>Hi, I’m studying in the US and is set to return to Vietnam this June. I wanted to see how dating is like in Vietnam, specifically Hanoi, before officially returning so I got on Bumble and let’s just say I am scarred for life.
 Every guys I have talked to kind of expressed that I was not good-looking to them. I am 5’2 (163 cm), which is said to be average height but most guys told me I would have a difficult time finding a partner in Vietnam bc that’s too tall. One guy said I looked like a random Tiktok man and another said I looked prudish when his goute was “modern women.” I asked what do modern women look like and he said “someone who is stylish and knows how to take care of herself.” He further said since I went to a Western university, I should have adopted their way of dressing up: more revealing clothes and heavy makeup. I told him that here in the US, it is not that common to see students dressing up and have a full-faced makeup every day. Then he kept asking for bikini and croptop pics. Though I don’t wear bikini, I like crop tops so I can send him some, but I declined bc I think it’s rude to ask for these photos because he wants “to have some motivation to tán me”.
 At first, I just want to find someone I can talk to but these interactions really crushed my confidence and made me hyper-aware of my looks. I wouldn’t say I’m ugly and I have never heard that from anyone else. In fact, a lot of people (both Vietnamese and American) called me cute or pretty. My clothes are not out of style at all. I just don’t like too revealing clothes and don’t like wasting time on heavy makeup. I guess the best word you can describe my style is classic Parisian (and occasionally basic hoodies + jeans). I am starting to doubt whether moving back home is a good idea as it feels like I would not fit in at all. 
 Maybe, I guess I just forgot how much Vietnamese cared about vanity.

                              <span>I’ve always found it interesting how despite Vietnam having an incredibly close relationship with nature whether that be with their treasured Buffalo’s, Whale worship (Cá Ông) or effective use of Guerrilla Warfare, that it’s currently the 2nd worst rated country when it comes to animal welfare, only beaten by China (https://theswiftest.com/animal-rights-index/). News of Animal Cruelty seems to be consistently coming out of Vietnam from dead whales washing up on shore in their droves without being investigated (https://globalvoices.org/2016/06/07/tons-of-fish-are-dying-mysteriously-in-vietnam-whales-too/amp/) to tiger/bear bile farms that operate despite prohibition (https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/news/hanoi-last-race-end-bear-bile-farming-vietnam-urgent-action-needed). This topic is interesting enough to me that I’ve been conceptualising a potential documentary on the subject and was wondering why people think it even got to this point? Globalisation? Influence from China? Simple lack of legislation or awareness? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with the topic.

My dumb reach are always Afternoon Dive (Afternoon Swim clone) from Montagne and City Rhythm Miami Tropical Confession (coconut, floral, seductive 😍)

                              <span>Sorry in advance, if this is the wrong subreddit to post this here, as I could not find any Vietnam History specific sub-reddit.
 Hi everyone!! I am Pranjal(Male from India). I am highly interested in urban history-seeing how urban spaces originate and grow. Hanoi was of particular interest to me as it possibly is the continuously inhabited oldest city in SEA(from time of Dongson Culture- Co Loa). 
 I have spent the past month charting out the history in Hanoi from Co Loa, Northern Domination, Thang Long, French Colonization, Socialist era and post Doi Moi era(till around 2018) going into as much detail as possible. I just landed in Hanoi yesterday and plan to be here for a week. As part of my (amateurish) research, wanted a perspective from a Hanoi local as well who has an interest/knowledge regarding Hanoi&#x27;s history(especially regarding the architectural history). In return for the help, more than happy to share my knowledge regarding history, bear any transportation/food costs, even cook some Indian food for you :) etc 
 Also if in case you have reference of some paid historical service/tour group which can give me an holistic overview of Hanoi from Co Loa to present( I couldn&#x27;t find any), that will be great as well. 
 Thanks in advance for the help :) 
 The sources that I have used so far-
 1. Hanoi: Biography of a City - William Stewart Logan
 2. Vietnamese Architecture - Le Phuoc
 3. Van Horen, B. (2005). City profile Hanoi. Cities, 22(2), 161–173.
 4. The new Hanoi: Opportunities and challenges for future urban development- Divya Leducqa, Helga-Jane Scarwellb
 5. The origins of Ancient Vietnam- Nam C. Kim

                              <span>Growing up in Thailand, i have a pretty good impression of Viets, alot of my online friends are Viets, and they&#x27;re pretty chill (and horny 😭😭😭)
 But i never asked them how they actually felt about Thailand (or any other SEA country that doesn&#x27;t border Vietnam) in general, since they just know us as a femboy country with good food and strong gaming culture
 How do you feel, as a Viet? I&#x27;d like to hear

                              <span>If you&#x27;re driving around, you can often see symbol like this written on the side of the truck&#x27;s doors. 
 https://i.imgur.com/00jQDgE.jpg
 Most often, these are written like a fraction, so: 850 kg / 5N. 
 As an engineer, I got used to units and my 1st thought was: kilogram (kg) per Newton (N) does not make any sense. They are both related via F &#x3D; ma, so why divide them? And it&#x27;s not like the division will yield &quot;a&quot; which is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. 
 Anyway, I found out today after speaking with a trucker: N means Người aka passenger 🤣 So it lists the max no. of passenger you are allowed in the truck.

 I was born with my right hand missing at the wrist, I can still hold a handle bar with it but obviously can&#x27;t accelerate or break. Currently living in Hanoi. Any info or advice greatly appreciated! Cheers

                              <span>How easy is it to hire an artist and in Ho Chi Minh? Do I go through recruitment agencies or fine arts universities? 
 How much would I need to pay them a month? 
 Also, how easy is it to find a ceramicist? 
 Are Vietnamese ceramicists able to work with porcelain clay or do they only work with white clay? 
 Thanks all.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am looking for a full set of polyhedral dice for Dungeons and Dragons (dnd). I noticed there&#x27;s a lot of stunning stone art in Vietnam and I&#x27;ve been looking for those kind of dice for a family member. It doesn&#x27;t have to be fancy jade/gems, but ideally solid stone.
 Thanks for your suggestions.

                              <span>I want to depict the culture correctly. The character himself is a young 21 year old male who is a second generation American, both his parents were also born in the United States and his grandparents are from Vietnam. Character-wise he is very much a happy-go-lucky person, always follows the rules, and is always looking on the bright side of situations and is looking for a career in culinary arts. (This is just a general character description I don&#x27;t want to get into a plot synopsis)

                              <span>I&#x27;m stood here queueing since before 8pm to get through the check-in, immigration, boarding pass check x 2 and also need to get to the gate. It&#x27;s 10pm on a tuesday and our flight is at 11.25pm, we got to the check in desk 10 mins after it opened to be met with a huge snaking queue.
 I know they were in my case internal flights, but Da Nang and Hanoi airports were an utter breeze in comparison.
 Why is everything so slow and inefficient at this airport? Is it always this terrible?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been travelling a few weeks here and I&#x27;ve seen in some squares, especially Hanoi and Sa Pa people playing some kind of badminton ball but heavier using the feet. It also makes sound. It looks very fun and I want to bring it to my country as I&#x27;ve never seen it but I&#x27;ve been looking around and couldn&#x27;t find it! Many thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>Hey everyone, me and my partner are travelling from the UK to Vietnam next week (for 14 days). We are taking over with us 30 million VND in cash and have recently seen we need to declare this as it&#x27;s over 15 million (conflicting information on Gov.uk website). How do we do this? Is it done when we arrive in Vietnam? On the plane? Before we go?? 
 Our airline (bamboo airways) unfortunately hasn&#x27;t been any help and their correspondence tells us to ask the UK Government. 
 Thankyou for any help!

                              <span>My GF and I are currently in HCMC, and are considering doing a tour of the Cu Chi tunnels. However, both of us are somewhat overweight (and quite tall as well) and we have heard the tunnels are a very tight fit.
 We are wondering if it is worth visiting, even though we probably can&#x27;t fit in much of the tunnels?

 And I also see that conscription Is a big part of the military, with male citizens joining the military for 2 years. But my question is, does the conscription system work for Vietnam ? It appear to me that Vietnam use the Soviet model for conscription. With field formations consisting of masses of infantryman, as a result of such a large number of soliders; the training, tactics, communication of those units are simplified. 
 And with most cases, when a person complete his 2 years tour, he goes home, meaning that anyone who replace him, need to be train again. Large amount of money are used to train and retrain unit…</span>

 I am a Swede with half Vietnamese blood. I have lived in Sweden since I was a child and sometimes return to Vietnam after getting married. About 2 years ago, also in April, I was stuck in Vietnam due to the outbreak of COVID. I was surprised to see that the media in Vietnam often publishes positive news about the local epidemic situation but spread the opposite news about other countries, especially the West and the US. I remember they said that American people have no food and students have to eat leftovers. When I asked my wife (100% Vietnamese and her family lives there), she said it&#x27;s normal with TV stations there. Then, when the nightmares of the epidemic passed and we returned to Sweden, we kept receiving calls from her family in Vietnam, asking if we were okay and hungry because television often broadcast news about the bad situation. like Europe is about to enter the stone age —a food crisis, a gas crisis, that sort of thing. And most recently, when we planned to join a tour, which included a visit to the West Coast of the US, there were calls from her family again, like, be careful of the shootings!
 But yesterday, when my wife showed me this statistic, I just... I wondered what was going on. After the wars, why do Vietnamese people have such warm affection for America?

                              <span>I&#x27;m still quite new to Saigon since my family moved here for work. I miss dating girls and I didn&#x27;t give it a try so far because I am still quite unfamiliar with customs here.
 I&#x27;m not really looking for a relationship right now more just having a good time with open minded people. You could say I&#x27;m looking to &quot;picking up girls&quot; and I&#x27;d love to hear some advice how people roll with this kinda thing here. Where would be the best locations and what is and isn&#x27;t generally accepted here when flirting or trying to get closer to someone.

                              <span>Hello people,
 I am going travelling around SE Asia for a couple of months but I am worried about travelling with my ADHD medication. I am unsure of the legality of Elvanse in Vietnam as it is an amphetamine based stimulant, so I was considering switching medication to Concerta (methylphenidate) and bringing in a 2 months supply with a doctors note.
 This is not ideal but it will keep me going. 
 I have tried calling the Vietnamese embassy but I am sent straight to an answer machine with no option to speak to a human and I have tried to book an appointment but they are jam packed until July 😬 
 If anyone could shed any light on the legality of both Elvanse and Concerta in Vietnam I would be incredibly grateful. First hand experience is great too but it would be amazing if someone had some solid legal advice with a link or something. Just to put my mind at ease 😎 
 Also, I’m sorry if this question isn’t permitted on this sub - just remove it.
 Thank you 😊

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I am curious to know what is your impression/thoughts of Vietnamese food when you see it through pictures, videos, etc. Do you like it, find it appealing or not?
 Therefore, I am conducting research for my graduation thesis with the topic &quot;The effect of Vietnamese food&#x27;s visual experiences on tourists&#x27; emotions and travel motivation&quot;. And I am collecting data through this survey https://forms.gle/D1ZrPZhjjDCTU2uZA so I really appreciate if you can spend only about 5 minutes to share your thoughts on the survey because I really need 30 responses more.
 Thank you so much in advance.
 I would really love to discuss Vietnamese food with you.

 Are there any agencies or companies similar to https://www.supportshepherd.com/ that could help us find and vet candidates for us to hire? They are based in the Philippines, but as I&#x27;m a VK, I would prefer to hire from Vietnam if possible. 
 Thank you!

Ngôi trường mình đang học là trường do bố mẹ mình lựa chọn ( kiểu trường nhà nước, phải thi công chức ) toàn lũ cocc, chắc suất vào ngành còn mình thì nản từ hồi mới vào trường rồi vì học xong ra trường thi đỗ thì cũng kiếm được 2-3 triệu/ tháng. Mình cũng thử đá sang các ngành khác nhưng cũng không khả quan hơn là bao. Mình biết mình còn trẻ và không sợ thất bại nhưng thất bại 2-3 lần khiến mình bị khủng hoảng vì mình không giỏi như bản thân và mng nghĩ. Mong mọi người cho mình lời khuyên với, mình cảm ơn nhiều ạ !!!
