                              <span>So, my gf is currently in vietnam and I&#x27;m in Cambodia. I was recently in vietnam on 15 day visa exemption, but now I want to work out the cheapest way to stay in VN for approx 3-4 months as a tourist.
 it&#x27;ll be Da Nang by the way.
 I assume flying in with e-visa is the first step, but what then? someone mentioned the cheapest way currently is to fly to BKK and back on e-visa again every 30 days - is this right??

                              <span>Does this actually have diazepam in it or is the packaging comparing it to diazepam? The only active ingredients listed are some sort of herbal remedies for sleep.

                              <span>Hi r/Vietnam
 I&#x27;m going to central Vietnam (Da Nang, Hoi an, Hue) in a couple days. 
 It&#x27;s gonna be a short trip. We&#x27;ll arrive on Monday evening and leave Saturday morning (so about 5.5 days in Vietnam?)
 So my question is, how much should I budget for this? I don&#x27;t have fancy tastes or require luxurious hotels.
 And also, what&#x27;s the best way to get my Dong?
 Its probably gonna be the most convenient to exchange my money at the airport but I&#x27;ve heard the rates aren&#x27;t so good...

                              <span>Hi everyone, we would like to move to Đà Nẵng-Vietnam from Germany and stay in Vietnam for a long period of time. 
 About our backgrounds: Me, vietnamese, i&#x27;ve been working in Germany as a nurse since 2018 My fiancé, german, currently working for an enery provider.
 It&#x27;d be helpful, if anyone could give us some insights. About what we should prepare, before we make the move. Maybe someone who has recently moved there. What should we pay attention to? How is life going on for you guys in Đà Nẵng or anywhere else in Việt Nam?
 About visa: should we first register our marriage in Germany, so my fiancé can get the 5 years visa?
 We want to prepare and inform ourself before the we make the big decision. We would be thankful for any tips or resources from you guys.
 Why i am a vietnamese and i still need to ask? Because i can&#x27;t possibly know everything, what my fiancé should prepare, etc ...if we should first get married in Germany, if it gives him any advantage about visa.

                              <span>I chat with an Indian. After a month we arranged to meet at a coffee shop.
 The first time we met, we talked normally, suddenly he asked me &quot;How much is my salary?&quot;. This is a question that makes me quite uncomfortable, there are many topics to ask but he chose to talk about salary first. Not to mention he has body odor, bad feet and smelly shoes which is quite annoying to me. He disrespected me in our first dating. I don&#x27;t need someone who is too handsome, I just need to dress neatly and cleanly
 After that meeting, he suggested we become lovers :))), of course I refused and just wanted to stay friends but he kept bothering me, so I blocked him and no more contact. 
 As a Vietnamese myself, I get annoyed when other people ask about my salary. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s normal to ask about salary in the first meeting for foreigners?

                              <span>I&#x27;m flying to Hanoi at the end of the month and will be travelling north to south over the course of 30 days. I&#x27;ve been researching itineraries online and on this subreddit but there&#x27;s a lot of information out there. It makes me feel a little overwhelmed and unprepared.
 I have some places in mind that I&#x27;d like to visit and have drawn up a rough timeline. I&#x27;m pretty flexible so your input and any useful information/advice would be much appreciated. I&#x27;ve opted for 3 nights in Hanoi as I arrive late evening. My timeline is as follows:
 Hanoi: 3 nights Sapa: 2 nights Ha Giang loop: 3 nights Halong bay: 2 nights Ninh Binh: 2 nights Vinh: 2 nights Hue: 2 nights Hoi An: 3 nights Nha Trang: 2 nights Dalat: 2 nights Mui Ne: 2 nights Ho Chi Minh: 3 nights Phu Quoc: 2 nights (Optional)
 Thank you, cam on!

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m not of Vietnamese descent, but a character in a story I&#x27;m working on is and I want to get this right!
 She is first-generation Vietnamese American, so she will go by an English (Christian) name throughout the story, but she still needs a Vietnamese given name and family name. 
 The English name I&#x27;d want to give to her is Trinity -- so &quot;Trinh&quot; would be perfect, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;d sound weird if used as a first name. Any other ideas? I&#x27;m not super committed to &quot;Trinity,&quot; but I&#x27;d like there to be some connection between her given name and English name.
 I also need a family name. I know &quot;Nguyen&quot; is the stereotypical one, but if you were reading a book with a Vietnamese main character, what other names would sound normal and natural to you?

                              <span>People will often use Google Translate to communicate with me because I don&#x27;t understand Vietnamese at all. 
 When they show me the translation (Vietnamese to English), I can understand what they mean, but when it&#x27;s my turn to type something, they often look confused when they see the translation provided by Google Translate. 
 It makes me wonder, is the app accurate when it comes to translating English into Vietnamese? It seems to be ok the other way around.

                              <span>Having just visited and being shocked at the state of repression by the government, political prisoners, corruption and just generally outraged at the state of the country, I have a question. Especially with what&#x27;s happening in Iran and other places around the world. 
 What would it actually take to create an uprising against the tyranny of the government and elites? And if that happened, what would likely occur? Would they be able to quash the rebellion if it was big enough?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I’m currently in Ho Chi Minh city, from where I’m planning to travel up to Hoi An eventually. I want to take a train up towards Mui Ne first. I booked one that arrives at the Binh Thuan station, which is a bit further away from Mui Ne. Does anyone know whether it is easy to get good reliable transportation between Mui Ne and that train station?

                              <span>I will be in Ho Chi Minh for a few days at the end of October and would like to make a trip to the Mekong Delta. I have looked at offers for day trips on various sites and they all say the same and very touristy. It seems like you are driven from shop to shop to buy coconut sweets, honey and chocolate and then see a show of people playing &quot;traditional&quot; music for you. Maybe I&#x27;m being too sceptical and it&#x27;s not a touristy mall after all, but maybe someone here has experience with this.
 Are there perhaps other providers who offer tours on less beaten paths? I am grateful for any tips.

                              <span>Hello y&#x27;all, I&#x27;m a female solo traveler planning to go to Vietnam (and also Cambodia) for a backpacking trip. I&#x27;m planning to visit the country south to north (mostly focusing on the north) , and I&#x27;d like to stay in Vietnam for 25 days (I&#x27;ll dedicate either 4-5 days to Cambodia, just checking out to the capital and Angkor Wat). Is that enough or too much time? My main interest are nature, and history. I don&#x27;t really care about hitting the beach, and partying is okay but not like a must. My itinerary is Ho chi Minh - flight to Hoi an - Hue - Phong Nha - Tom Coc (ninh binh) - Hanoi - cruise to Ha long Bay - Ha Giang Loop . Is there anything that i&#x27;m missing?
 I&#x27;m planning to be there at the end of February, March (i&#x27;ll definitely be in the north during march). Is that a good time to visit? Can I book everything once I&#x27;m already there such as accommodation/flights to have some extra flexibility, or is it high season and I&#x27;d probably book everything ahead to avoid shitty hostels and expensive flights?
 Should I bother going to Sapa or is it too cold/foggy in March, and not worth it?
 How is it safety wise? Are night buses safe, do they drop you in the middle of nowhere or you can ask them to drop you close to your accommodation? I&#x27;m not thrilled about potentially walking alone at night with a huge backpack. Can you as tourist (i&#x27;m a skinny white girl there is no way I&#x27;ll pass for a Vietnamese) walk safely at night alone ? Is taking taxis/tuk tuk alone at night safe (i&#x27;ve lived in south america, heard way too many horror stories)?
 Thanks for all the help :)

 First time solo traveler here planning a trip from Dec 22nd for 3 weeks. Already booked a flight to Hanoi and plan to travel N to S. 
 I&#x27;ve heard sapa is still worth it, but halong bay might not be due to the weather. Have also heard to limit Hoi An to 1-2 days. Any other recommendations would be appreciated greatly!

The eggs were cooked I believe with fish sauce but I can’t quite figure it out. The eggs were scrambled I think and ended up clumpy so you could grab a piece, add to your rice and enjoy. They served rice bowl, eggs in bowl, some kind of sprouts (any ideas here too?), and other bowls of food like tofu.
 Please help!

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I plan on living in Vietnam after graduating university. I was born in Germany and would finish university at approximately age 24. I am a vietnamese citizen despite being born in Germany. 
 So now I&#x27;d like to ask on how conscription would affect me, since I am also a pacifist.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Going on a long flight to Australia from Europe and stopping in Vietnam. The ticket I bought requires me to get bags in Vietnam from my Dubai flight and recheck them in (I believe this means I have to pass through customs) before I go on to my next journey to Australia. Does this mean I need to get an E-visa even though I wont even be exiting the airport?

Sapa (Trekking, Visiting Fanispan)
 Ha Giang (Motorbike tour)
 Ba be lake + Ban Gioc Waterfalls
  
Which one would be the best considering the time I have and for travelling solo? Can i fit in more than one place?
 I have to return to Hanoi to catch my flight on the 2nd.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I have been reading a lot about ethnic, mountainous groups in rural settings of Vietnam. I came across the Chut ethnic group located in eastern Laos and in Quang Binh province and I’ve have been trying to find information on their religious beliefs and specific cultural idiosyncrasies that separate them from or align them with other ethnic practices in Vietnam. I suppose I am more trying to find out more about their “religious” practices, primarily relating to death and funeral processions. I can’t find anything. 
 Do they practice a generally “animist” belief system pertaining to the afterlife, spirits, etc? I know commonly in animist belief structure, there is this idea of the wandering soul, in that unnatural or untimely or violent death can result in malevolent spirits that cause turmoil for those around. Is this pertinent among any of the 5 subgroups (ruc, May, etc) under the Chut umbrella? 
 Thanks for any input

 I find all of the info somewhat confusing. Seems like an e-Sim would be the way to go, since my iPhone is not unlocked. Can anyone please share their useful info/ experiences? Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hi everyone. American here; I live with my Vietnamese-American wife and my Vietnamese mother-in-law. I need some help. Sorry for the incomplete information, but my MIL&#x27;s English isn&#x27;t great and my Vietnamese is worse.
 Today, my MIL was telling me that she&#x27;s very concerned because she follows a guy (singer? monk?) on YouTube, who is famous for raising five orphans. This is the Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/thienambenbovutru9. Apparently the guy is in jail because he&#x27;s been accused of having sex with the kids, but he&#x27;s claiming innocence and asking people to sign a petition for him.
 Does anyone know about this? Is this some kind of famous case? And if so, how can my MIL sign the petition for him?
 Thanks for any help!

 And as part of the trip I want to mention an apartment in the area of ​​District 1.
 My only problem is calculating a budget for the trip.
 How much money do you think you need per month? For a good apartment.. and to eat every day in a restaurant?
 Because I understood that your country is very cheap.
 1500 dollars per month should be enough?
 sorry for the english
 I use automatic translation so it&#x27;s not that good

                              <span>Hi guys, I stayed in Vietnam for a couple months pre-covid (Hanoi, Da Nang, Cat Ba) and really miss it. I am planning to spend a couple years now and would like to keep my skills sharp. 
 I&#x27;m wondering what the process/opportunities are like for foreign English speaking software engineers? I don&#x27;t need anything fancy (although would be nice) just something that will keep me busy and meet new people. 
 Any advice or experience appreciated!

                              <span>Hello
 Flying to hanoi to attend a wedding at the end of the month. I will be with a group of other foreigners (10 of us from around the world)
 Have no idea what to expect, what the dress code will be or what we need to bring.
 So far we have been told the time and location of said wedding. Apparently there is a ceremony, I have been led to believe two monks will be there (what do the monks do?) that the bride and groom will then leave to take photos in a different location, then come back for the reception. 
 I’ve been told by a different friend who currently lives in Saigon that Vietnamese weddings aren’t too long, and there’s often karaoke involved. 
 Any information that will help my friends and I not be totally blindsided or make any cultural faux pas would be appreciated.

                              <span>We are visiting Vietnam in January for 1 week. We like to scuba dive. We also like to scenic landscapes with waterfalls or mountains and rivers. Is Hanoi better or Ho Chi Minh?
 Edit: Thanks for the excellent information guys! I think we are set on Hanoi, area because Scuba is less of a priority for us. Definitely more interested in dramatic landscapes. Really appreciate all the tips.
 Are the common scam tactics we should watch out for?
 Edit 2: After seeing comments about high chances of fog in Hanoi area we are unsure now. We are thinking central coast, as a happy medium in between both. I assume we have to fly there from either Hanoi or Saigon?

                              <span>Hello all, not sure if this is the proper thread to post these questions, but I figured I’d give it a try. I wanted to get some perspectives on the the animist religious structure in Vietnam, “The People’s Religion” - the belief structure and its history simply interest me and I’d like to learn more; that being said, there isn’t much info online so any input would be appreciated. Here’s a general outline of what I’d like to learn that:
 1) How did belief in good/bad spirits initially come to be from the beginning?
 2) How did the colonization Vietnam by the French, invasion by Japan and the split between North and south Vietnam during the communist era effect Animist beliefs?
 3) As with Buddhism and Catholicism for example, they produce cathedrals, sculptures, art and so on - tangible forms of their doctrines. Does Animism have any equivalent buildings, depictions, etc? 
 Just a guy here trying to learn. I’d appreciate any input.

                              <span>This seem to be a major problem in Vietnam. 
 I&#x27;ve never seen it on this scale anywhere else in the world apart from China.
 There are:
  
Overdevelopment by poorly run organisations who often do not finish their developments. They are left to rot as eyesores all over the country. Unfinished construction sides and rubbish everywhere. You can see this in Saigon, Hoi An, Dong Nai, Mui Ne, many places. And its too late to reverse it, the environment is already destroyed. They stay there to rot for a decade or more sometimes.
 Illegal developments, most likely with crooked local govt involvement. Example: https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/phu-quoc-to-raze-79-illegal-villas-4518959.html . And once again, the environment is totally destroyed already, cant get it back.
 Developments run by competent organisations, but way too much public land is granted to them. One example - Novaworld Phan Thiet was granted almost an entire 1km of public beach front land just for them. Likewise, big sections of Phu Quoc, Nha Trang, Quy Nhon and others have had the environment totally wiped out for all manner of empty resorts. Is this not outrageous?
  
I am interested to hear from Vietnamese especially. Are people upset and angry about stuff like this? Or do people not particularly care? Or do many people actually &#x27;like&#x27; it or prefer it?

                              <span>This is my frustrating and traumatizing experience as a traveller in HCMC.
 On 2 Oct 2022, I caught a peeping tom in the 3rd floor female toilet of Saigon Centre. I looked up in my cubicle (instinctively), saw that he dodged backwards. So I got dressed and started taking a video and slamming on his cubicle door.
 I cropped this video because I don&#x27;t know how to blur out his face. lol
 He exited the cubicle and acted like he entered the wrong toilet, but based on my video, his camera app was still on. I grabbed on to his wrist to prevent him from escaping and made him open his photo album AND SAW A COMPROMISING PHOTO HE TOOK OF ME IN THE TOILET. I made him delete the photo from his photo album AND recently deleted folder. I shouted at him so fiercely and angrily and berated him non-stop and…</span>

                              <span>Trước giờ mình rất tin tưởng và hài lòng với dịch vụ chăm sóc giày tại spa M, phí ở đây cũng không rẻ nhưng khi đôi giày giặt xong rất là hài lòng, mới như mua ở store về. Nhưng từ khi bên này chạy chương trình khuyến mãi thì xảy ra rất nhiều chuyện như: giày giặt cả tháng cũng chưa có, không hề gọi điện thoại báo, để khách đi đi lại lại nhiều lần, đôi khi nổi điên thì mới sắp xếp trả giày. Mà trả giày còn ẩm ướt mới tức.
 Một lần giặt đôi thể thao trắng (mới mang được 1 lần), giày giặt hơn cả tháng mới có, xong 2 ngày sau lấy ra thì giày mốc đen toàn bộ đôi giày. Mình mang lại thì nói xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại, hẹn mình 2 tuần sau quay lại trả giày. Khi nhận lại gì một số vết ố mốc đen giặt không ra, mình có hỏi thì nhận được câu trả lời “xin lỗi” là xong. Tức cầm giày về thế là bỏ luôn đôi giày.
 Hôm nay bị một cú quá đau, cách đây hơn 1 tháng mình có gửi giặt 3 đôi giày. Mình nhờ em mình ghé lấy giày dùm, em mình chỉ kiểm tra 1 đôi thì thấy đôi trắng bị mốc đen, cũng bài cũ xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại. Em mình cầm 2 đôi còn lại về mà ko kiểm. Tối mình đi làm về mở ra xem thì muốn chết đứng luôn ạ, toàn bộ da bị co cứng, teo lại và bị chết, đế lót cong veo,...mang ko còn vừa. Mình nhắn facebook không phản hồi. Là đôi mình rất thích kiếm mãi mới có, nên giữ rất cẩn thận, mỗi lần mang ai cũng khen đẹp. Lúc mang đến thì còn đẹp, nhận lại thì eo ôi không còn nhận ra hình hài của em nó...
 Thực sự quá tệ từ dịch vụ cho đến chất lượng :((

                              <span>I am just really curious that are there any decent size Youtubers that are living here in Vietnam? Not like travel youtubers that had been to the country or foreign youtubers making content exclusively Vietnamese if you know what I mean (like Phúc Mập is a good example). Youtubers like Quang Tran is a good example of what I mean, his content is not exclusively Vietnamese, like showcasing tourism, foods and culture. I see a lot of big foreign youtubers often prefer to live in Thailand, the Philippines and other East Asian countries but I don&#x27;t see a lot living in Vietnam.

Mình đang làm vị trí operation administrator tại 1 công ty Mỹ, công việc đang rất tốt và có cơ hội thăng tiến. Mình có tham gia tuyển TVHK (vi mình rất thích làm tvhk từ nhỏ) thì đã đậu, nhưng khi mình tìm hiểu hơn thì thấy hơi hoang mang ko biết có nên vào không. Vì phải đóng 1 số tiền khá lớn để training và với mức lương TVHK năm đầu tiền mình nghĩ bản thân sẽ gặp khó khăn rất nhiều, ngoài ra mình có nghe về vấn đề sắp chuyến bay nữa. Có ai đã hoặc đang làm TVHK ở đây có thể cho mình xin 1 chút ý kiến không ạ?? Mình cảm ơn nhiều.

 English Hi everyone, lets discuss about pho. Specifically how the name came about, is it named after the broth base or the noodle?
 Case in point: 1. If it’s named after the broth - let’s use egg noodles instead, is it still “pho”?
  
If it’s named after the noodle - let’s use hu tieu broth instead, is it still “pho”?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I was in 2018 and 2019 in VN (Hanoi, HCMC and a few other places) with my fiance and we are thinking about going back this December. We really liked the Old Quarter, the area around Hoan Kiem lake and the busy streets with the narrow houses.
 I was thinking about going to HCMC this time again and would like to know if there is a district or area where you can get this &quot;Hanoi feeling&quot;.
 Any help is highly appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I work in IT, 100% remote, so it&#x27;s technically possible for me to work from abroad instead of from home. I&#x27;ve considered going to Vietnam for 1mon to do so, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good fit culturally and logistically. Please share any experiences or insights.
 My main concerns are:
  
working time from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. - should I look for co-working spaces etc. or is it generally realistic to use the hotel WiFi? I don&#x27;t need a lot of bandwidth, but it should be stable.
 
I&#x27;m autistic and while sensory-wise bustling cities and dense traffic are totally fine, I struggle with judgemental/high conformity culture, expectations of haggling and worst, being viewed as a &quot;target&quot;. I have lived in China and Japan, which was okay since speaking the language mitigated most of the issues. Unfortunately, the reports about Vietnam I have read point towards exactly my issues being...well, an issue. What&#x27;s the real deal here?
 
 I have studied some Vietnamese and should be able to reach a low intermediate level by the time I go there, if that helps.

                              <span>I got married to a Viet girl recently and we argue about money a lot. I was born in Canada so my idea was that we would contribute equal percentage from our income for our shared expenses, and we handle the rest ourselves (to each their own money) - however she&#x27;s not happy with it. She thinks that since I make more, I should contribute more than her since I will have a lot more money left. Is this the norm for a Viet girl? House chores we share 50/50 (I&#x27;d often do more because I want to) and everything else is equal but she won&#x27;t budge about this part.
 Everyone is completely misunderstanding my point. We aren&#x27;t doing the 50/50 split. I pay over 70% of everything. What I suggested was we both put half of our income into a shared account from which we would pay for our expenses. The idea of each of us having separate money to handle for ourselves was from her. The point here is that she thinks I should put more than half my money and she less so, so that what&#x27;s left to each of us is more or less equal. She also wants to keep her job and not have children for at least another 7-8 years.

However, I lost the language when I was very young and can&#x27;t ask my father for help as I want it to be a surprise! I was hoping someone could help me with an accurate translation, it would mean the world. The phrase is simple but I don&#x27;t want to leave it to a translating program:
 &quot;Always remember who you are&quot;
 This phrase holds a deep personal meaning associated with my father and I. However, the exact wording or translation can be flexible depending on what translates the best. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

                              <span>When i order food at non-english speakers 90% it works out just fine. But sometimes it is just not possible to communicate whatever options there are using gestures. The thing is, i am an adventurous eater and genuinely don&#x27;t care what i get on my plate. The weirder the better. 
 So i&#x27;m looking for a phrase in vietnamese to express &quot;I like everything&quot; or &quot;it does not matter, there is no food i don&#x27;t like&quot;. Any help would be much appreciated :)

                              <span>At school I&#x27;m currently doing a unit on countries in the Francophonie, and first on the list is Vietnam. So from what we&#x27;ve discussed in class so far not a lot of people speak french, but it seems that it&#x27;s still used to some degree by the government, which seems odd to me. But more importantly my teacher believes that french in Vietnam is like the language of power, you learn it if you want to be a politician and are seen as a power seeker if you&#x27;re learning the language. This doesn&#x27;t seem right to me based off of the basic knowledge of Vietnamese history I have, so am I right, is she wrong?

                              <span>Hello! Not sure if this is a typical question, but I am an English teacher and I have a Vietnamese student who is still learning English. I was hoping someone could help me translate the two words below to help him during our lesson? Google translate won’t work for these, I think. 
 Will: the one that is someone’s last dying wish, not the verb 
 Work: as in ‘things will work out,’ not like a job or to work. If you could tell me how to say the sentence “we’ll find something that works” I’d also really appreciate that! 
 If anyone knows how to say these things in Vietnamese I’d be sooo grateful!

                              <span>Good morning from America! I was offered a position at a School called Aston, apparently an English teaching school for elementary kids. They&#x27;re in HCMC and Can Tho. My question is, how reputable is it, and is it viewed positively or negatively compared to RES? It gives me housing + 10m vnd + stipend so I&#x27;m really leaning into it.

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 I would like to get advice from you. I highly appreciate your polite comments and valuable advice. I&#x27;ve wanted to work as a freelance. I&#x27;m tired of working in the office with dramas and I&#x27;d like to be flexible so Freelance is my top choice. I&#x27;ve worked as an English teacher and content creator before. I am trying my best to learn more about digital marketing and photoshop for my future. 
 I created my Upwork account and tried my best to apply and get proposals but there was no result. I was upset a little bit. my parents are older and they often get sick so I&#x27;d like to push myself in working freelance. Should I still look for a job patiently or get some free work and then get a rate? 
 I can write English articles, create content on social media and get a good boost. Would you like to recommend me anything? I&#x27;m pleased to listen from you guys! Thanks in advance!
 Bonus: my house is noisy so I can&#x27;t teach English at home or work as n English tutor. And I&#x27;d like to manage social media than teaching kids.

                              <span>Hey I&#x27;m a german middle eastern girl and I really want to learn vietnamese in order to better communicate with my boyfriends mother. He is from Hanoi and I really want to learn vietnamese with the nothern accent but all apps seem to be in the southern accent, which is way different than what he speaks. I already learned a lot about his culture, and we often find a lot of similarities. He is very interested in mine and I want to show him how important he is to me as well! Thank you all🌸
 EDIT: I seemed to have open a big discussion 😭 I said/made this post because whenever I learn with my boyfriend, or try to practice myself I send him the things, thats when he tells me that they don&#x27;t say it that way/ use different words or that the pronounciation is more southerly than northern. I don&#x27;t ever want to offend anyone. I just want to be able to communicate with his mom!💗 thanks for the great advice!
