                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m looking for some advice regarding my 27 day trip to Vietnam in January. 
 I am thinking of doing the day 3 loop of Ha Giang in the first week of January at the beginning of my trip, but I&#x27;ve also heard it can be very cold and possibly snowing, as well as foggy. Would it still be worth it to make the trip during this time, or should I skip it?
 What kind of clothes should I bring if I do decide to make the trip? I want to make the most out of my trip while enjoying it, and as it would be one of my first stops on my trip, it could set the tone of the rest of my trip. 
 ​
 Really looking forward to this trip! Also, would love to hear any other off the beaten path suggestions of where to visit.

                              <span>First time going to Vietnam in couple of weeks and route is pretty much planned except I have 11 days to spend south of Da Nang. Any tips about places to visit and about travelling around would be helpful. Note that it would be great if I could fit some travelling with a motorcycle there. Thanks.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a month since i started studying business at a small vocational college (but i think i will switch to a safer option: logistics since i realized a 3 year business program is pretty shallow and too general plus im not very talented to surpass the average ). Well the experience isnt so great because of the age gap and the irritation caused by knuckleheads who are in here just to avoid military duty .But at least i stopped feeling lifeless like before somehow. Ive just got myself some small targets and plans, hooray. Btw im seeing someone from the school recently, isnt that sweet for a miserable peasant

                              <span>Looking for something that my dad and I (while in Vietnam) drive mainly, but ideally my mom (50s) can too. She already has an electric bike and doesn&#x27;t really use it much. The scooter cant be too heavy and should have decent storage. Something that looks like a vespa is what I have in mind, but I&#x27;m open to anything, both electric and gas recommendation. Much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi! I have been to Vietnam 5 times now but have yet to do the Ha Giang loop. I&#x27;d like to leave the USA in february to dodge part of the winter and go back to Viet to ride the loop. I remember that Hanoi was quite cold and rainy when I was there in January and I&#x27;d prefer to ride the loop when weather conditions are optimal. Is February too early to ride Ha Giang Loop? I can wait until early march if I must but going early february is preferred if conditions are similar. I am getting conflicting information as a I read articles about it. 
 Btw I am experienced with riding a motorbike in viet countryside and am aware of issues with trucks and busses. Im guessing that I wont have problems with riding Ha Giang. I was thinking of a Honda Wave semi-Auto. It was reliable last time I did a trip around Vietnam and Im not practiced on manuals. Like many others, I am not going to be riding this legally. Im aware of the risks but just like last time I went to Vietnam, I gotta do what I gotta do.

                              <span>For transferring fund from monthly investment from VN bank to outside VN, what is the best bank for non VN citizens?
 So far I know Citibank VN allows transfer. But there is a high fee of 165,000 vnd monthly if we don&#x27;t maintain 100 million vnd balance. Not sure if we can buy cds or saving to maintain this balance. Any other advice would greatly be appreciated.

                              <span>I review cars on YT/Instagram in Korea and have driven every Korean EV, would love to compare to Vinfast, Im still developing the channel but get up to 30k views on my reviews. In Korea they have https://motorstudio.hyundai.com/itg/ln/main.do?lang&#x3D;en You can go look at cars and even just book cars in advance to test drive without any sales intention at all. I have done this a lot in Korea
 Can I do this if I visit Vietnam?

The trip was extremely spontaneous as I booked my ticket on Sunday evening, and I applied for my visa Monday morning. It says it takes 3 days to process and tomorrow morning will mark day 2. Im concerned I won’t have it before my flight in a couple days, does anyone know a way to get an expedited Visa? Any advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi guys, my girlfriend and I are spending the next 4 months in Vietnam. We fly into HCM and plan on travelling the Deep South - Mekong Delta onto Phu Quoc.
 We have estimated on spending 20-30 days in this region and are wondering if this may be too long? We are also considering exploring the delta on motorbikes (is this worth while for the time spent there?).If so would anyone have experience or routes biking the delta/south. We mainly found 1/2 day trips online about the delta, and haven’t found much on longer self planned stays.
 As far the places entail (suggestions welcome!)
  
My Tho
 
Ben Tre
 
Tra Vinh
 
Vinh Long
 
Can Tho
 
Sa Dec
 
Cao Lanh
 
Long Xuyen
 
Chau Doc
 
Ha Tien
 
Phu Quoc
 
 Any advice would be hugely appreciated :)

                              <span>Here are some situation in which I regularly come across.
 I am in the lift, it arrives at my floor, the doors open, and people rush in before I could get out.
 Go for health check. Come early to avoid the crowd. The doors open, again everyone just rushes in and put their paper first. Then others come lift the pile of papers and put their under I hope that the person working there will flip the pile.
 Someone on a motorbike arrive at an intersection, wants to turn left,but there is traffic so can&#x27;t turn directly,so just start driving on the incoming traffic until they can final cross. Instead of waiting at the intersection.
 It is lunch time,some parents come to pick up their children, there aren&#x27;t many people, just 2 or 3 bikes. And still, they find the way to park right in front of the gate.

 The plan for a HSR line running across the country was authorized in 2021. Originally planned to be a 350kph/220mph-ish line, the 2022 version calls for a designed speed of 250kph/155mph and an operating speed of 180-225kph, or 111-140mph. The construction will take place from 2025 to 2041 in three phases, a nine-year reduction compared to the original plan. It will utilize electric multiple units as the rolling stock, with both passenger and freight versions running on double-track standard gauge (1435mm) rail, as opposed to the existing narrow gauge (1067mm). 
 The line will be 1508km/937mi long, consisting of ~70 stations. The annual estimated figures for passenger and freight is 163M and 65M metric tons, respectively, with 142 pairs of passenger and 128 pairs of freight train running daily. The first phase (2025-2031) will comprise of a 361km/224mi line connecting Thu Thiem (HCM City) to Nha Trang. Following this, a line from Hanoi to Da Nang will be constructed from 2031 to 2038. The final phase (2038-2041) will involve connecting Nha Trang and Da Nang. Roughly $61.7B will be spent, with the majority (63%) coming from land acquisitions and auctions. 22% will come from state-funded sources, with private funding expected to be about 15% of the total budget.

                              <span>Can someone explain to me as a foreigner the fake European towns that seem to be popping up around Vietnam. 
 It’s super impressive the sheer scale of these places however I’m struggling to see how they will be filled with shops, hotels and tourists?
 Who is the target market here?
 For example the Sun Group’s primavera village in Phu Quoc is id say 80% complete, what will the plans be? For tourists to live and stay in the town?
 Super intrigued by it all!

                              <span>So long story short I am a doctor at an internal ward in hospital (not an English speaking country). I have a Vietnamese patient that has a rather complicated, newly diagnosed disease. She understands basic things but I&#x27;d like her to have a better understanding of what are we treating here and what are the implications and perspective. I could use a google translator but given the circumstances I don&#x27;t want anything to be misinterpreted or lost in translation. Could anyone please help me with the translation? There are some medicine related words in the text but I tried to keep it understandable for the patient. I will PM you the text if you&#x27;re up for it. Thanks !
 EDIT: Thanks to u/huongv , I have the translation. Perfect !

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve tried looking for past post about good massage parlors and they seem to be outdated (~3 years ago)
 Since Vietnam is slowly reopening due to COVID, I&#x27;m wondering if there are any good massages around Hanoi. Especially near the Old Quarter and Ho Tay. For both locals and tourist (specially those that can speak English)
 My wife was raised and born in Hanoi for 20+ years and haven&#x27;t been back for 10 years. We don&#x27;t mind going to a massage parlor that only speaks Vietnamese since she can translate and my Vietnamese is at an elementary level for an American.

                              <span>Hi, I am travelling to Phu Quoc, Hanoi and Da nang/ Hoi An next week. All sorted on the places to go and things to do, but I really wanted suggestions about the food to eat and the places to eat it from 
 I know this is very wide and vague, but I want to try all the local dishes and really sample as much of the Vietnamese cuisine as I can because I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll come back to this beautiful country. 
 Any suggestions about the joints/ restaurants to check out would be appreciated, along with the regional dishes to try. I understand a lot of Vietnamese food is street food so if you guys even recommend the streets/ markets to go to in these cities to sample the local fare, would love that. 
 Specially looking to try as much coffee, noodles, rolls as I can!

 My bank&#x27;s fees are ridiculously high with 3% plus the base service fee of almost a million.
 Does anybody have any idea how to move money into Vietnam without giving parts of it to the financial leeches in the process?
 I&#x27;ve heard that gold sellers are offering good rates but I were wondering about their actual capacity limits.
 Could anyone share their expertise and experiences with me on the subject?

                              <span>Hello All
 I am new to reddit. I am a student studying illegal drug use globally. I am doing a side project focusing on Vietnam specifically, and noticed that there has been a lot of prescription medicines being seized by Vietnamese police. Why is this happening. I never remember this being an issue 3-4 years ago.

                              <span>Hi guys, I am currently travelling through Vietnam. 2 days ago while on Cat Ba island as I was biking, a dog came up to me and seemed friendly. He played around for a bit and ‘teethed’ (place his teeth on but not bite) my hand. He also lightly scratched me (left a mark for 5 minutes before disappearing). Does anyone know if there is rabies on Cat Ba Island? And also does anyone know if the situation I described is enough to transmit rabies? I’m currently heading to Ha Giang so will be away from any vaccination clinic. But it is now a massive worry, as I thought Rabies is evident with aggressive or erratic behaviour.

                              <span>Hi, As posted earlier in this sub, I am planning to visit Vietnam for a work related trip from the 16th of November. 
 But prior to that, I have been asked to prepare an assignment on Agriculture-based industries in Vietnam. I have gone through a few articles and videos on the internet, but it would have been really great if I could receive some insights and sources from locals there. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Recently visited Phu Quoc and my mates and I came about a metre from stepping on a snake.
 It was a very thin little guy, with a bright yellow head and a grey-green body. I can&#x27;t for the life of me find anything about them on the internet, but wanted to check and see if any locals knew what they were called?
 Has anyone seen these dudes around?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 After several years of living abroad and not dialoguing in Vietnamese, I&#x27;ve been looking to buy an authentic Vietnamese dictionary that is used and sold in Vietnam to refresh my language. What is the best way for me to find a store that ship to America in Vietnam? I&#x27;m open to paying someone with relatives living in Vietnam who could buy and ship the dictionary. I appreciate any suggestion and advice. Thank you in advance.
 Cordially,

 I&#x27;m visiting Vietnam and I will be there in the last week of November and the first week of December this year. I have heard about floods during the month of November but would they happen in December too? What are the chances? And which areas might be affected if there are floods in December (first week)?
 I have two options. 1. Visit Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue from 28th November to 2nd December OR 2. Visit Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue from 2nd December to 6th December
 Which would you suggest? 
 Appreciate your help a lot.
 Thanks a ton :)

 Thanks

 I&#x27;m traveling today to Phu Quock. I&#x27;ll be there for 4 or 5 days to chill but I want to spend some time to travel around island and see some stuff. Do you have any recommendations what I should see, where to go for food and best way to travel around island. Where is nice beach?
 Is motorbike best way to do it? And if so good place to rent a bike. Open to any ideas
 Cheers!

                              <span>I&#x27;m staying in Ho Chi Minh for a few months, flying from the U.S. I can&#x27;t find anyone to dog sit for 3 or more months. So I thought I&#x27;d fly my small dog with me in cargo, he&#x27;s a really easy going dog. I read the requirements, vaccines and health certificate, anything else? Has anyone done this that can share the experience? Is it easy to do or is it a hassle?

                              <span>I speculated an alternate lore (short) where North Vietnam instantly invaded (or special military campaign&quot; in Laos to weaken the Western-dominated &quot;American&quot; alliance influence in Southeast Asia. Had Pathet Laos toppled the corrupted Vientiane government either in 1963 or 1964, then South Vietnam faced a peril where the newly communist Laos government planned to infiltrate Central Vietnam (South Vietnam) to prevent largely American forces gained on foothold across Central Highlands.
 Another POD is both Vietnams divided at the 16th Parallel (leaving Da Nang and southern branch of Thu Bon River under North Vietnam side). It would create massive chaos in Laos where communist North Vietnam easily determined to aid Pathet Laos to &quot;liberate&quot; Vientiane around early 1964 or 1965 (or even before 1968 Tet Offensive) depending on American military moodiness. North Vietnamese General Giap would like to see the size of NVA forces to orchestrate the moderately launched assaults of several Laotian towns and villages near the Vietnam-Laos border.
 With Laos under a &quot;socialist&quot; Vietnamese client state (regardless if Vietnam divided in 17th Parallel as per OTL or alternatively divided at 16th parallel), South Vietnam could faced intensified harassment from largely local &quot;VC&quot; communist forces near the South Vietnam-Laos border and even near provincial capitals in Central Highlands. This would lead the American government to seek peace talks with North Vietnam and Soviet Union secretly in a third country. If successful peace talks in mid-1960s, American could be saved up to 30,000 American soldiers and even save largely funds to fight against poverty in the domestic U.S. I generalized a possibly no Nixon as President of U.S in 1969.
 Can you think about ideas that devastated South Vietnam?

                              <span>Hello, I will visit Vietnam for two weeks. I don&#x27;t have a fixed itinerary but I&#x27;ll start from HCMC and finish in Hanoi. I plan to stay mostly in hotels as I would like to have a nice relaxing holiday.
 In my previous trips, I have mostly stayed in hostels so it was easy to meet people. 
 As a solo traveler, where are good place to meet people? Both in big cities and smaller places, but especially in HCMC as this will be my first stop

                              <span>We have most of our Vietnam itinerary booked except the Northern Vietnam section. We will be flying up from Danang (staying in Hoi An for 4 nights). We have done HaLong Bay already so this time we are thinking about Lan Ha Bay. I think it makes sense to fly into Cat Bai Airport (HPH) and do a 3 day night night cruise. And then bus back to Hanoi. 
 Should we stay in Haiphong for a night before cruise?
 There are so many cruise options, does anyone have a preferred option? We are obviously going for the honeymoon vibe. 
 Some options we are seeing for cruise include:
 Ylang by Heritage Cruise Line
 Perla Dawn Sails
 V’Spirit Premier Cruise

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking into a day trip to the delta and tunnels and seeing some serious hit-and-miss reviews. Most negative reviews are stating that it&#x27;s basically a shake-down where you&#x27;re expected to buy things and tip everyone at every stop. It&#x27;s an 11 hour trip and I&#x27;m on the fence as that&#x27;s a full day I could spend exploring Saigon.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently travelling Vietnam &amp; my skin has gone to shit because I&#x27;ve been neglecting it. Could anybody tell me a good place to get good, legitimate products? I already have sunscreen so I&#x27;m mainly just looking for a cleanser, moisturizer + maybe some chemical exfoliators. I&#x27;m willing to spend $$ if it&#x27;s worth it. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello friends,
 I will shortly be traveling to VN for the first time. I read a lot about taxis scamming you with prices. Also when renting bikes / scooters there are people with vests charging fake fees when in fact a free parking spot is just down the road. I read to just ignore them but I‘m easily „intimidated“ as I don‘t want to get in trouble especially in a foreign country plus I’m traveling with children. How do I best deal with these situations?

                              <span>Heading to Hoi An tomorrow for 3 nights and would be interested in getting a tailored suit. How exactly does it work and can it be shipped internationally as I am backpacking around SE Asia and wouldn&#x27;t have space for a suit.
 Any recommendations for a tailor that could get me a good suit for between 200-300 euro (or is this an unrealistic price range?) My girlfriend would be looking at getting a dress aswell but wouldn&#x27;t be dropping as much money on that.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right group for it, but I am going to give it a shot anyway. My girlfriend and I are going to thailand in November/December. We start in Bangkok, and will later on move up to Chiang Mai. In between, however, we will do a 4 day city trip to Hanoi. We are not looking for anything in particular, but would like to know if there are any (boutique) hotels in Hanoi that you really recommend / stand out. Our budget is around 1.700.000 VND. We are open for anything. Thanks all!

                              <span>So I got my passport stolen, so I got a exit stamp on my emergency passport which only permits me to go home.
 However, I’ve now got a new passport sent from home with no stamps on it.
 Do you think I should get an exit stamp put on my new passport. Or I’ll be okay just to enter Cambodia showing my emergency passport with an exit stamp and my new passport with no stamps?.

I can&#x27;t find anything about it on Reddit and the tour guide I&#x27;ve booked a couple things through said it&#x27;s a little crappy in terms of its tours and whatnot. Im still interested - honestly the lack of info piques my interest just having been to the insanely crowded halong bay. 
 Anybody been and have recommendations? I&#x27;m solo travelling and all the bookings through the ba be website require you to book for 2+ and are quite expensive.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an American living in Saigon (for over 3 years now) and my wife is Vietnamese, born and raised in central VN.
 Lately we talked about moving out of Vietnam to somewhere more permanent. I love Southeast Asia and want to stay, but Saigon has ridiculous real estate pricing and interest rates on house loans. Also, crazy pricing for international schools, crazy traffic etc. So I&#x27;ve done some research and see many foreigners who moved to Malaysia and they seem to really love it. KL/Penang seem very developed with good public transportation, great real estate pricing even for luxury places, good mortgage rates, good tax situation for digital nomads, and international schools are cheap. Overall it seems like a clear upgrade over many aspects of Saigon (don&#x27;t hate me for saying this, I honestly don&#x27;t know, just read online).
 For some reason though my wife is not down with this idea. She doesn&#x27;t like Malaysia and the culture there. I&#x27;m wondering what other Vietnamese people think of Malaysia and Malaysian culture? If you ever visited or lived there, what did you find hard to adjust to? What did you like or not like? 
 I&#x27;d love to hear your opinions!

                              <span>In the current debate surrounding Affirmative Action, many people evoke &quot;the poor Vietnamese who are uneducated and therefore need affirmative action&quot;. First off, most schools don&#x27;t consider the difference between South East Asians and East Asians. Secondly, statistics paint a different picture. Look at this table from Pew Research:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/pik9p1w0h0y91.png?width&#x3D;1694&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;87eee2b83401f3d4349b212c79251d00db52dc14
 As you can see, Vietnamese born abroad, that is, the refugees, have low educational attainment. But for the generation that was born here, educational attainment is higher than whites. This, of course, contradicts the liberal narrative that Asians are doing better because of higher socio-economic status. Yes, they are correct -- many Vietnamese came to the US poor and without much education. But their children perform better than white Americans.
 The same story is told with income:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/pocewmi4h0y91.png?width&#x3D;1646&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;4830d089be09f22dccae7fe3c065106b16ddc751
 So, pro-affirmative action advocates, stop using the Vietnamese as your token Asian minority to disguise your Asian racism. If you dig into the data, you might not like what you see.

                              <span>Because to the southwest they have hooker bars with &quot;bar fines&quot; in Cambodia, while in Vientiane, Laos, there are a hyperabundance of Vietnamese girls rocking the massage plus plus venues (because it&#x27;s apparently illegal for mixed race sexual relationships). Surely there are low-key strip clubs/girly-bars available under the radar, but why is Vietnam so conservative in this domain? Also, plenty of clubs in Mongolia (UB) and even majority-muslim Indonesia. 
 After living here for almost 4 years it&#x27;s a little disappointing to not have ready access to a girly-bar, but I of course don&#x27;t know why. What do you think Reddit?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been reading about different tribes around the world. Long ago (10-15 years?) I came across something online that said Vietnam has 52 tribes, and that most are in north Vietnam. That seems like A LOT for such a small place. I can google and find stuff on my own but I&#x27;m asking just in case someone might know some great material that I can read. It can be in Vietnamese. I can use Google Translate to translate the text. Thank you!
 I love this food YT channel based in Vietnam for going to visit the tribes around the world. This one is in Vietnam but I didn&#x27;t catch which tribe it is. https://youtu.be/81aLMRK1ris
 These are all the tribes around the world that they visited. Reminded me of Anthony Bourdain who visited unknown places. https://www.youtube.com/c/BestEverFoodReviewShow/search?query&#x3D;tribe

                              <span>Is it possible to open a bank account on a 30 day?
 Have been hired by a company and will have to do a visa run in the next couple of weeks. The problem is I’m running low on funds and kind of need to be paid before doing visa run etc.
 Is it possible? Or do I have to wait until I obtain work permit?

                              <span>Hello, I little background about me: I’m half Vietnamese and half white with family back in Vietnam. I’m visiting for the first time in nearly five years next year and I want to work on my Vietnamese. I learned a small amount from my mom growing up (she worked long hours and did not have much free time) but I otherwise grew up isolated from other Vietnamese people. I’ve tried a few app/services and I’m currently using Duolingo. I am aware, however, of how specific the Hue dialect is, and I’m worried that I’m learning bad habits and potentially making myself even more unintelligible to my relatives. Does anyone know of any services that specifically teach the Hue dialect? Or any tips for someone using Duolingo (which I believe is the northern dialect) and trying to apply what they’d learn to the Hue dialect? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’m cutting my hair this Saturday at a Vietnamese shop. I’m a Vietnamese speaker but my vocabulary on hairstyles is limited.

 Thank you!

                              <span>Last week while I was travelling through Vietnam, I was going to fly from Hanoi to Hue and had a flight at 8PM. However, Vietjet decided to change my flight for 10AM of the same day. First of all, I had never seen any airline bring forward a flight before. Secondly, they refused to refund me the entire amount, and the only solution offered was a &quot;creditshell&quot;, which is a credit I can use for future flights with them. Now that I&#x27;m back from vacations and can afford to lose some time with this, I wanted to ask if anyone had any success obtaining a full refund from them for a similar situation, or if this is a lost cause and I should just forget about the 70$ I paid. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>This post is quite targeted but I will write it in English anyway. As a French student in Hanoi for 6 months to study or more, with eventually an paid/unpaid internship, what type of health insurance should it take? I heard about CFE, but do I need another insurance (or mutuelle) on top of that? What health care tips have you? For example, my welcoming school asks me for a proof of total cover for covid-19 treatment.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t get enough of the stuff (the vietnamese beef jerky), is there a magical place somewhere in this country that is the Bò Khô capitol? 
 Or any good places to buy it between Da Nang and Hanoi? At the markets i usually find very sugary beef jerky, and in the supermarkets its crazy expensive (and i would much rather support a family!). Any place where i can &quot;buy it at the source&quot;? In Da Nang right now if that helps.

 Has this happened to anyone before? How was it? What did you do?

 ​
 Tôi là một người dùng mạng di động của nhà Mobifone Hơn 12 năm nhưng lại không thể tin được mình bị ép buộc, chèn áp vào các khoản hợp đông trói buộc kinh khủng này.
 ​
 Ngày trước khi còn dùng gói cước HD70 thì nhà mạng bảo do tốc độ 3G yếu nên không hòa mạng không được. Sau đó nhân viên đề nghị tôi và gia đình sử dụng gói 120k tháng. Hứa hẹn 4G / ngày gọi điện nội mạng miễn phí. Đăng ký 6 tháng
 ​
 Thì ok tôi đăng ký được vì đối với tôi việc quan trọng là hòa mạng tốt.
 ​
 Nhưng Không Ngờ. Tôi đã bị gắng theo một bản hợp đồng trói buộc thiếu tính minh bạch!

 Khi mà đến tại Trung Tâm Mạng Viễn Thông Mobifone Hậu Giang các nhân viên ở đây kêu tôi ký chổ này chổ kia và chỉ nói là ký đồng ý hoa mạng gói 120/ 6 …</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m planning a trip to Hoi An soon and I&#x27;d love to know the answers to these questions:
  
Do the markets accept cashless/card payments?
 What do they sell at the markets besides souvenirs like bags and things?
 Are there any tourist apps/technologies that help you get around and give you information on the city?
 How&#x27;s the wifi access when touring around?
 Is the area mostly full of tourists, especially in the markets? Or do locals also frequent those?
  
(Reposting this because I accidentally confused Hoi An with Hanoi)
 Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>Hey, me and 4 of my friends are visiting Vietnam soon and are planning to travel from north to south over the course of 2 weeks. We have planned some of the trip, but we’re not sure if we want to go to Nha Trang or Phan Thiet/Mui Ne. We want to stay 3-4 days in one of those areas.
 Any thoughts?? Pros/Cons as to where to go? The trip is in the beginning of december, and temperature will be considered aswell.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey Vietnam, an outsider here. As leaders of both China and Vietnam met recently and in the west the general opinion on the ccp government is pretty bad, now I know that Vietnam has worked to have good relations with both the us and china but It got me thinking what the average Vietnamese here think about China and the ccp?
 Idk if these kinds of posts are allowed but I guess you can remove it if it breaks any rules.
 Thanks

                              <span>I’m a Vietnam born and raised millennial. Now I’ve read a lot of writings where it is pointed out that MSG/bột ngọt aversion is originated from a 1968 racist research in USA. For me that explains why the western world is on the err side when it comes to MSG. 
 Still I don’t really know why a lot of Vietnamese, my parents, people of their age, my age, and younger (Gen Z) is still very skeptical with MSG. They:
  
 Makes an effort to avoid eateries/restaurants that they perceive to be using too much MSG
  Claims that they’re nauseous or having headaches when consuming too much or any MSG at all
  Avoid using MSG in their cooking
  
I do find 2-3 to be quite funny because Vietnamese are still using a lot of stock powder/bột nêm which is basically flavored MSG. 
 Is there any knowledge for where this MSG aversion in Vietnam originates? Is it because of the 1968 study that carries to Vietnam during the war and persists thereafter? Do you experience 1 and 2 yourself? I do want to listen to you guys.
 Do you think MSG induced sickness is placebo effect?

                              <span>I see this used a lot in text and I’m not sure how it’s suppose to be used. For example, I said “né câu hỏi ă” and was corrected to using à instead. 
 If it matters, I’m a native speaker but moved to America at 7 years old. I can speak pretty well but my reading and writing skills are weaker.

                              <span>Sorry if the question is not clear, not sure how to formulate that ahah.
 So, I&#x27;m half vietnamese but I don&#x27;t live in Vietnam. Their is a conflict in my vietnamese family about an apartment in Vietnam.
 My grandmother own an apartment and let my aunt/her daughter live in this apartment, free of charge. It was supposed to be only for a few years, but well... After a long time (more than 30 years), my grandmother wanted her daughter to leave the apartment, but her daughter claim that the apartment is now her&#x27;s because my grandmother didn&#x27;t reclaim her ownership for a long time.
 My grandmother has the legal document but she has never consulted any official since she got the apartment (so a long time ago).
 I just want to know what is true and how land ownership work in Vietnam. I think my aunt is just lying so that she can keep living in the apartment, but as I don&#x27;t speak vietnamese it&#x27;s hard to find informations.
 Not sure if I should post it here ahah, so sorry if not and for any of my mistakes !

                              <span>Hey all, Currently traveling in Vietnam, at the moment I am in Nha Trang getting my scuba certificate. It&#x27;s super lovely and the people are really nice, some of the cutest super lovely people I&#x27;ve met. But I can&#x27;t walk down the street without people on their scooters stopping asking me for a ride, people selling glasses, chips, paintings, bracelets, necklaces, tours and private car tours. I get people have to make a living. Which is totally understandable. It&#x27;s probably more a culture shock to me than anything. I can&#x27;t walk down the beach without being asked by people every 40 meters I walk if I want to buy their things and knickknacks. It&#x27;s gotten to a point where I&#x27;m starting to feel rude to these people.
 But they also can&#x27;t take no for an answer and are really really pushy and persistent. What are some ways to get your message across that I don&#x27;t want to buy without being super rude or guilt tripped into buying? Thanks everyone.

                              <span>Both my parents are Vietnamese. They immigrated to the United States in the 80s. I was born in the U.S. and a U.S. citizen. I don’t have much information on my father since he’s passed and I have no contact with that side of my family. My mother is half Vietnamese. Her father was a (U.S.?) soldier during the Vietnam war. She was raised in an orphanage and has no paperwork like a birth certificate and she does not know where she was born. She says she might still have Hộ khẩu somewhere. 
 I should probably talk to a lawyer but do you think I might have a shot at applying for a Vietnamese passport?

                              <span>Saw this buffet in a Youtube video and it looked spectacular.
 In the video they mentioned it only costs 70$ (which for the items offered there sounds like a very good price) but when I checked online I couldn&#x27;t find any detailes about the price.
 Can anyone share their experience eating there and perhaps confirm if the price is about right?

                              <span>Xin chào! I have recently started to learn Vietnamese as my girlfriend&#x27;s parents are from Buôn Ma Thuột. I would love to speak with them in their native language to make them feel comfortable. 
 From what I hear, their dialect doesn&#x27;t sound like Southern at all, more like Hue dialect but I am not sure. For those that have been to the Central Highlands region, do you know what dialect they speak? Would learning Southern Vietnamese be enough to converse with them or should I learn their specific dialect?

 I am a videographer and world traveller from Canada currently visiting Cat Ba. While traveling through Vietnam I am making a video about my trip and I am personally very interested in the fishing traditions of the Vietnamese. When traveling I really value meeting with locals and properly experiencing the places I visit rather than going through the regular tourist route.
 I’m posting to see if there is anyone in the Cat Ba/ Local bay areas that would be willing to show me and my film partner the local experience for a few days. I would love to learn about traditions, see how people in the area have lived, meet families, and fish! It would be amazing to have someone who can translate as I love to interact with local people but am limited by only speaking English.
 The person would need to be okay with being on camera and would definitely get some beautiful photos of them on the adventure!
 Edit: when I say local guide, I do not necessarily mean a tour guide. I am looking more for a local who is interested in making some new friends and wants to show off and educate about the Vietnamese culture

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 27m American . I&#x27;m taking my first trip abroad. In preparation I decided to learn Vietnamese.
 My teacher 35f Vietnamese has been teaching me for 6 months and I have to admit I was flirting w her. I genuinely like her wit. 
 We have been talking about me coming to visit and she has offered to pay for my ticket from Hà Nội to Đà Nẵng as well as the room while I&#x27;m there. It&#x27;s seems to good to be true. She is just so nice and pretty. In my home country this is beyond abnormal.
 What should I be skeptical about and how do I protect myself from potential dangers?

                              <span>Fake sneakers are really popular in Vietnam. You can find them in Ecommerce site, around the street, in the market, or even in a shop. Lots of people say that t is a great choice to buy fake sneakers, since the fake sneakers quality have been nearly original, they are same produce item and process.
 What&#x27;s your opinion on this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a flight from Chiang Mai to Vietnam tomorrow but I can&#x27;t see where to buy extra baggage weight? Apparently online check-in isn&#x27;t a thing for international flights on their website and I have to go through the agency I Booked through.
 Is it possible to buy the extra weight when I check in at the airport? If so how much will this cost. I can buy it through my agent but they want $40 whereas I&#x27;ve seen lots of people pay less than that.

                              <span>Basically the title. This is my first time getting a visa at my local embassy, I have been getting visa on arrival since I started travelling to Vietnam. But this time the visa attached to the passport didn&#x27;t have the red stamp on it, but it had the signature and all the other information. So my question is, is this gonna be fine? Will this be stamped when I arrive? This is my first time doing this method so I&#x27;m being really worried about it and I can&#x27;t find any information about it online. If this is dumb question I apologize but I really don&#x27;t know how this method works so yeah, I kinda need some help here to be at ease.
 I appreciate anyone who could answer, and I apologize in advance if this is a really dumbass question.

                              <span>Just want to ask because I am not sure if it&#x27;s just me. Basically in Vietnam I have been using Duolingo without having to pay but still receive benefits like unlimited hearts, no ad and free &quot;purple&quot; test.
 While I was in Canada, there&#x27;s heart limit and it costs 100 gems to do the test but as soon as I returned to Vietnam, it switches back to Vietnamese policy. I did change my Google Play account to Canadian to install a few apps there (I cannot change it back within this year).
 Yesterday I realized all the limitation is applied on my app as if it&#x27;s Canadian and they offer me to try the Super thing with CAD currency. I am wondering if it&#x27;s just somehow use Google Play account as location now or is it the new policy in Vietnam? If no one else is affected by it, it&#x27;s worth an email to their support I guess.

I know this will make things difficult so is there any common meals that rarely contain these ingredients? Any other advise on this subject is appreciated.

                              <span>So I plan on traveling from HN all the way to Phu Quoc, and back to HN.
 I intend to travel alone, by car.
 Has anyone here had experience driving like this? What should I prepare in advance? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Chào mọi người, sắp tới mình dự định kết hôn ở tuổi 24 sau từng mấy năm tính góp 1 thân 1 mình, thì mình cũng đã đủ kinh phí cho đám tiệc các kiểu, nên cũng k cần vay mượn ai cả vì đó là kinh phí của bản thân mình. Mình có thể xin những lời khuyên của các đàn anh đi trước và các bạn kiểu nên lựa chọn mặt hàng kinh doanh nào không ạ, vì mình biết chắc mình chỉ có một thân một mình không ai hỗ trợ nên cơ hội của mình cần phải cẩn thận không là gục luôn 🥲 mình có định hướng là sẽ mở 1 shop bán phụ kiện 420 ở tại gia vì mình cảm thấy có thể phát triển được vì tại địa phương nơi mình sinh sống chưa có mặt hàng này nhưng cũng đang đắng đo lắm, nên mình cần tham khảo thêm ý kiến của các anh các bạn để có thêm định hướng và những kế hoạch duy trì cho kinh tế cá nhân để nuôi gia đình mình ạ 🥰 cảm ơn các bác đã đọc

                              <span>I’m traveling to Hanoi next month and I’d love to pick up some bespoke men’s dress shoes and/or a leather jacket. Is Hanoi known for leatherwork at all? When I search I see a lot of recommendations for leatherwork in Hoi An, but unfortunately I won’t have time to go down there. Any recommendations for shoe makers in Hanoi or should I not bother?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know much about Vietnam when it comes to Vietnamese culture, social rules, family etc, we want to get engaged soon and she always talks about having 3 children and such what is crazy for me as a Brazilian considering people here have a single child or nothing, I like her but I&#x27;m pretty much scared out with this thing, because I know Vietnam is a traditional country and people are too serious when it comes to posterity, at some extent I don&#x27;t want her to be attached to someone who is not very up to have many children as I.
 Btw, I love Asia, the martial arts, I like how Vietnam is a country of resistance and fight against the imperialism, I&#x27;m totally fine with Vietnam, but still scared, I know more about China, which is a country I&#x27;ve been there before and I know the culture, however I can&#x27;t read Chinese, same with the Vietnamese language it scares me out, I&#x27;m also scared of her family, you know I own tattoos which is not a big deal in the west but I know Asians are afraid of it, Btw I&#x27;m totally lost about this situation. 
 I&#x27;m a substitute PE teacher and she works at a pizzeria but she is studying gastronomy, also I have no clue about where to grow our children, Brazil, Vietnam or Europe, because I wish we could stay in Brazil as I love beaches, surf and such, but if we are going to have children we should go to the best place to grow them, also idk exactly what he parents think about this idea. I&#x27;m 24 she is 22, we have a long term relationship.
 Thanks.

                              <span>We have 3 nights/4 days to spend in Hanoi/Northern Vietnam. We would love to see the Vietnamese countryside north of Hanoi, but not really sure the best way to travel/places to go/how to get around. We will be starting off in Hanoi.
 We had thought of doing the Ha Giang loop, but we do not have motorcycle experience and worried it would be quite dangerous. We would like to visit Cao Bang, but again not sure of the best way to travel there.
 Any recommendations for how we can experience this part of the world would be really appreciated!

                              <span>Hiya,
 I&#x27;m visiting Vietnam for a couple of weeks and want to do something that&#x27;s not touristy &amp; extreme, fun, &amp; unique to southeast Asia, like the long-tail riverboat racing in this video.
 Is there any boat racing like this around Ho Chi Minh city?
 Or are there any other special suggestions? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi All,
 Not sure how the Halloween atmosphere is here in Vietnam, but there are probably some amongst us that are thrill seekers. Whether that could be abandoned buildings, ghost sightings, etc.
 Please list any places around HCMC down below.

                              <span>I have a very old aged Vietnamese flag used by my father since before I was born (I use the word aged because it&#x27;s old, not the flag of previous government, it&#x27;s the red flag with a yellow star).
 I got a new one and wanted to retire the old one but iirc it&#x27;s &quot;illegal&quot; to just burn it or throw it in the trash. Is it true? And how do you respectfully dispose it?
 I know about the American and Canadian flags but I think Vietnamese flag has a different process.

                              <span>In Vietnam recently, there have been a number of establishments and places that call themselves &quot;spa shoes&quot;. They are a place that provides shoe cleaning services, shoe repair, etc. As far as I know, the cost is quite expensive and Vietnamese people are willing to spend a few hundred thousand dong or even a few million just to make something for shoes. I don&#x27;t know to you guys from other countries, do you guys do this? In my opinion, they are really too expensive and wasteful, why spend hundreds of thousands of dong just to wash a pair of shoes when you can do it yourself at home. Do people give too much importance to footwear when it is just an object to protect the feet. It&#x27;s an honor for me to be able to hear your thoughts on this matter.

Looking for anything like physical activities, cafe places, good food places to eat, arcades or generally cool places to hangout at or to see e.g. I can speak (but not rlly read or write) vietnamese if that matters! Look forward to suggestions as I am trying to do a bucket list! Thank you very much!

                              <span>Xin chào các bạn!
 I&#x27;m coming back in November and I&#x27;m looking for a rental scooter place which includes insurance for a period of 1month in TP HCM.
 Would you have any recommendations? 
 Also, any budget estimation I should count with?
 A friend I have on place found one for 120k/day and I wanted to have multiple opinions before saying yes. 
 Cảm ơn !

                              <span>Hey guys , anyone have any unique suggestions for things to do in Saigon?
 Went to the cat cafe, did dining in the dark, and archery.
 Looking for other activities along those lines. Googling &quot;things to do&quot; just comes up with the usual tours and the such.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning to visit Saigon or possibly the cities near the middle of Vietnam and I&#x27;m making a food list to bookmark. Since I&#x27;ve never been to either of these cities, I&#x27;d like to know what people recommend. Please list your top 3s please, I would love to hear them.
 --------------------
 ​
 A fun little thing I do every city I visit is make list of the top 3 things I ate. When I think of a top 3 place, it&#x27;s the items/restaurants that I enjoyed eating the most. 
 In case people were curious, here&#x27;s a couple of top 3 food lists I made in other cities around the world.
 Taipei: 1) Lin Dong Fang beef noodle soup 2) New Mala Hotpot 3) Tian Jin Flaky scallion pancake
 Tokyo: 1) Ichiran Ramen! 2) Kobe Beef Teppanyaki HAKUSHU 3) Pablo Mini Cheesetarts

                              <span>Anyone have any idea as to why there are what I presume military jets flying low level over my house here in Long Bien, Hanoi? Have lived here over 10 years and never seen this before. Just saw a flight of four helicopters in formation heading towards Northwest. Military exercises?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got to pick up a friend at Noi Bai Airport but was wondering if there&#x27;s any short term motorbike parking where I can walk into the terminal to meet with them or do I just need to go to one of the overnight lots. I know the overnight lots aren&#x27;t too expensive, but if I&#x27;m just going to park for an hour or so, I&#x27;d rather not pay for the whole day.

                              <span>Sorry for my ignorance if this is a stupid question.
 My girlfriend has food allergies and we are going to Vietnam. Is buying premade food (sandwiches etc) at grocery shops a possibility to keep her safe from accidentally eating food she&#x27;s allergic to in restaurants? Do the grocery shops list ingredients on their food?
 Thanks for any replies

                              <span>I’m going for a Cave trip in January with Oxalis. They recommended non-Goretex boots for drainage, or insoles for their basic Canvas boots.
 Not sure which boots should I get as most hiking boots in MEC (Canada) offers goretex. Should I just get insoles?

He loves playing with his small sister but would like to have more friends who speak English or German. We live in Binh Thanh, Vinhomes Central Park. Do you have any suggestion for a playgroup or similar thimgs? Thank you! Edit: Sorry, I made a typo, i should have said &quot;...more friends who speak Vietnamese, English or German&quot;

 I have moved to HCMC and I need to rent a 125cc fully automatic scooter long-term.
 Can you recommend a good place to rent it ? Cheap with modern scooters would be awesome.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi all,
 Myself, my wife and a group of 3 others are wanting to do the Ha Giang loop.
 We’ve been using moped for the last 4 months throughout SE Asia and I have experience with semi-automatics.
 We did the hai van pass a couple of days ago nil issues.
 We’re unsure whether our experience is enough for the loop, as we’ve spoken to people who have done it but they were with easy riders and haven’t ridden a motorcycle before.
 I’d be doubling my wife, that’s been our standard way to drive the last 4 months.
 Is this a risky endeavour and are we better off going with easy riders?

 Was playing with a league/team in Ha Noi before moving to DN. 
 Haven&#x27;t seen much info about this on FB. 
 If anyone is down to play I do have a ball but no cones or flags 🤙
 Edit: American Flag Football 🏈:)

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 Firstly I love Vietnam! I have been here so many times and every time I have loved it here! 
 Also, I must confess I have a soft spot for the West Lake and Hanoi in general. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking to settle here.
 Obviously I would need a job in Hanoi if I plan to stay here. My primary focus is to work as a Graphic Designer but honestly I&#x27;m open to work in any other area as long as it&#x27;s legal and gets me a work permit to stay in Hanoi longer. 
 Can anyone guide me with regards to this? Thank you. 
 A bit about me:
 I&#x27;m currently in Sa Pa for a holiday and will be back in Hanoi tomorrow. I&#x27;m an Indian citizen. I have my bachelor&#x27;s degree in information technology and have some work experience in software testing. Currently working as a freelance graphic designer (remotely for a Canadian ad agency)

                              <span>Hey all! Xin chào! I’m currently on my 3rd one month visa to Vietnam and I love this country so so much that I’m wanting to make it my home base as I travel the world. Between the people, the scenery, the food, culture and vibrancy it is just completely in a league of its own. 
 So fucking gorgeous. My question is - I’ve had 3 one month visas issues already (only one in my current passport? If that makes a difference) in the past 4 years. Next year I would be hoping to get a 3 month visa and obviously more again as I come back. Is there a limit to how many times I can leave and return before immigration start asking questions? 
 My current visa expires on the 6th November, I would like to go to South Korea for Halloween and come back but then I’d be on my 4th visa since 2018. Is it wiser to finish my time here and limit the amount of re-entries to this gorgeous country? Or am I overthinking!!?? 
 Thank you! Cảm ơn!

                              <span>Hello,
 A friend and I are traveling to Vietnam for a month in December. We are renting motorbikes from Tigit and plan on first traveling north and doing the Ha Giang loop, then traveling south along the country towards HCMC. The Honda Winner is 200 dollars less from Tigit and I have read that they are more common and easier to have repaired. I have also read that the XR is comfortable and it seems like it would be better adapted for rough terrain. We are both well experienced with riding motorcycles; however, it is our first time in Vietnam and I understand how different it is. Taking the price difference into account, does anyone have any advice on which bike we should rent? 
 Thank you

                              <span>Hello, I am visiting Vietnam for tourism for two weeks and I am very excited about it! I am not sure on what is the best way to manage money while I will be there. I live in UK so I mostly use British pounds and I pay with card in most places. 
 From what I read, I should have cash because in many places only cash is accepted. What is the best way to manage money as a tourist? I was thinking about the following:
 1)bring cash (USD, would GBP be accepted at a decent rate ?) and then exchange it for the Dong once I am there
 2)bring only a minimum amount in USD just to have money if needed and then withdraw money in local currency from an ATM. Are there ATMs often? Do they charge huge fees? 
 I will backpack most of the trip so I would prefer to withdraw only a small amount of money at the time, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable to have the money of two weeks of travel on me.

                              <span>I booked a domestic flight in early Jan, and decided to check up on it to see if everything is OK. 
 The itinerary they sent me originally had the correct time of 11.45. After entering my booking confirmation and name, it shows 06.40!!! 
 Is it just because I&#x27;m checking this up too early or is this common practice for Vietjet to make sudden changes?

                              <span>Basically they only do the tours if there are more people and it comes to be way cheaper. The hike looks amazing and we‘d look to stay overnight for either camping or hotel (birdwatching at sunrise)! We‘re a brother and sister from Austria/UK and are very easygoing!

I can&#x27;t read vietnamese so I can&#x27;t tell what the signs and banners say. They also always seem to have plain clothes police standing in front of them.

 Thank you so much in advance 💕

                              <span>The drives we plan to send contains film footage (totally SFW). We just need to send in case we can’t upload the file to their system.
 I usually heard about not being able to receive electronic items due to Customs. But I don’t know about sending.

                              <span>I am making chanh muoi and had a question about the process. How necessary is it that the water be warm or hot when you first pour into the jar? I put the water in cold and it&#x27;s been sitting for about a day now. I&#x27;m hoping this will mean that I will just have to ferment for a longer period of time and nothing more? I&#x27;m just hoping I won&#x27;t have to restart the whole process, the container I&#x27;m using is plastic so I don&#x27;t want to subject it to a bunch of heat

                              <span>When you order a grab to the airport they may purposely take you to the wrong place. Then a taxi driver will explain that you are at wrong place and ask for a high price to go to correct place.
 My story: I told my initial grab driver i was at wrong place and after a few times of telling him it was wrong. He drove me to correct place reluctantly. I even tipped him.. I asked a security at correct place if it was in fact correct as i was second guessing myself. He was apparently working with them and told me to go ask someone at back. There were just more more grab drivers there. I was confused but i also didn’t want to be late. At this point I wasn’t aware of the scam and thought it was just a misunderstanding.
 New grab driver asked to pay to go to the initial wrong place saying it was the correct after i told him where i was going. Asks for stupid price once we arrived too. Thats when i detected a scam. But it was too late. Arrive there and thats when the taxi driver attempted to ‘help me’ (scam me) and drop off at correct place. And he will ask for money in us dollars. 
 Overall the scam wasn’t much in my currency. But i was so angry at the situation that i left the taxi without paying and told him to F off. This proved to work as he barely even chased. Probably because the security working inside the airport werent involved in the scam like the outside security was.
 My advice: act angry and dont back down. It worked for me as i was legitimately pretty angry at how they were fucking with me and risking missing my flight and losing a lot of actual $

I&#x27;m looking to understand more about the Vietnamese attitude towards sex (of any orientation) during this period. If you were living in the country at the time and would be happy to talk with me about your experiences, please let me know! Many thanks!

                              <span>So I heard you probably want to avoid traveling Vietnam during Tet, from what I read online Tet will take place from the 22nd-29th of Jan 2023, is this correct?
 If this is correct, will everything be back to normal already at February 1st? Or should I wait a little longer?
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>I am hoping to finally visit Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand to complete a trip I had originally planned in March 2020. I am vaccinated and boosted so entry requirements are fine, but what restrictions exist inside? Where do you have to wear masks? 
 What happens if I end up with Covid but without any symptoms beyond a common cold? Of course, I would stay in my hotel but would I be forced to go to some government location?
 Have many places closed permanently because of the harsh economic conditions? Any chance that borders will close again if there&#x27;s a new wave of infections or is the vaccine trusted enough?

 I’ve been wondering what songs would’ve sounded like in the ‘40s-‘50s before the French left, I was thinking of Pham Duy for example. Most 1950s songs I find are actually ‘70-‘90s covers.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently backpacking in Vietnam and am having a bit of a lady health issue. Either a yeast infection or some other similar sort of health infection! Sorry as I know this is a bit TMI, but I am wondering what to do/if any expats or locals in Vietnam have experience getting medication for this? I have used boric acid suppositories at home and they work great, so I&#x27;m specifically wondering if anyone has any knowledge if these are sold in Vietnam. 
 I&#x27;m currently in HCM, so I should have a lot of options I&#x27;m guessing, but so far have not had any luck.
 Any advice is appreciated!!!

 The final will be in Phu Quoc in January!

                              <span>Is there any sort of goth scene in Vietnam? Dive bars with live rock music or nightclubs that play spooky dance music? Underground shows?
 I&#x27;m particularly interested in Da Nang&#x27;s scene, since that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m living.
 So far, music wise all I&#x27;ve been able to find are the bands GoLim and Thoai 004. And pop punk stuff like 7uppercuts. What am I missing out on?

Sau đó ai cũng mệt mỏi, mình ko vượt qua được tổn thương và người đó cũng mệt mỏi với sự oán trách của mình. Sau đó vẫn chủ động muốn hàn gắn để sửa sai. Tuy nhiên sau khi mình đồng ý cho thêm cơ hội thì lại im lặng với mình. Bây giờ mình nên im luôn hay hỏi thẳng bạn ấy đang muốn gì hả mọi người.

                              <span>Hey folks, I move in two weeks to Saigon for 1 month before I move over to Da Nang. (Need to do some paperwork in Ho Chi Minh, so I decided to give the city a try and stay there for the whole month)
 I am an international Expat, who works online.
 My question now is, which area do you guys recommend? I don&#x27;t need a crazy party scene arround me with many drunken tourist party people but I would appreciate to have access to gyms, nice local restaurants/street food, nice areas to go for a walk(best would be in some kind of an old town environment for the walk), modern apartment to live in(price does not really matter but don&#x27;t need a super fancy place).
 My girlfriends sister lives on the eastern part of district 2 - very close to district 9. So we thought about staying close to her place(lake view city) 
 Is this considered as a nice area and are there things to do? I think it&#x27;s a little far from the actual city center but maybe there are enough things to do.
 Thanks in advance for your opinions
 Cheers ✌🏻

 Like thrift shops, cool bars, vinyl record stores, etc.

 I(26M) have a CELTA certificate, a degree in Hospitality and Food Technology(hated hospitality for the lack of salary and the fact its basically manual labour) and now I am about to finish my Master in Computer Science(love problem solving and banging my head against shitty code that wont debug itself). And I plan on coming to HCMC as a teacher in Nov,2022.
 I have been following the jobs (Tech and Teaching) a lot since the past 2 years and it seems like the usual pay ranges from 400k/hr for English Centres to 700k/hr for Universities. Usually teachers manage about 80-100 hours a month which roughly averages to 40-50 million per month for inexeperienced ones(with the right credentials) or with certain correct skin tones (without…</span>

                              <span>Here goes nothing so no need to be judgmental/cynical/sarcastic because might delete later. Pretty much as the title says. Writing this after few failed attempts at dating.
 33M, US, educated, good career, healthy, decent looking, average body (6&#x27;1), pretty much everything normal. If anything, I don&#x27;t go out much and have high standards. I tried dating locally but nothing worked and seems like the dating scene is getting smaller as I get older. I had a long term relationship with Vietnamese girl in the past that didn&#x27;t work out, but I still think of her today as the one that got away(just fond memories). Also, have many close VN friends and I love the culture, hence this post. I tried dating apps, change location and talked to few girls from HCMC. I even traveled there to meet but felt like they weren&#x27;t sincere and not genuine.
 I read somewhere here that it&#x27;s more trustworthy if friends/colleagues make introductions but all of my friends are older and dont know any single ladies. So, anyone want to be my matchmaker? (obviously after knowing me)

                              <span>Hello,
 I land in Vietnam at 07:35 on Friday the 16th of December and depart at 20:55.
 I&#x27;m looking for an 10ish hour tour - Pick up at 08:30 returning to the airport for 19:00. There is me and my mother. I&#x27;d like to find someone who can take us on a tour of the city; see the key sites, someone who is willing to accompany us and our bags (secure parking will be a necessity) for the day.
 Pick up and drop off at the airport is a must. We&#x27;re not married to anything in particular in terms of what we see, we&#x27;d like a local expert to tell us what we shouldn&#x27;t miss as people with 10 hours to explore the city!
 Happy to pay (comparatively well compared to tour companies) for the right person who can put together an itinerary for us.
 Can anyone recommend someone? or volunteer themselves?

                              <span>Hello reddit,
 Me and my friends want to visit Vietnam in a couple of months. We were thinking of buying motorbikes in the north, and riding from Hanoi to Saigon. 
 The only thing is, my two friends don&#x27;t have a driving license (no car, scooter, or motor) and have none or barely any driving experience, not even in the European country I&#x27;m from.
 I do have a driving license for a car and a scooter for some years (not for a motorbike) and would consider myself an experienced/good driver, but even I am quite hesitant about riding a motorbike in Vietnam. The odds for two (if i count myself in three) totally inexperienced motorcycle drivers to get into any kind of accident when riding in Vietnam for a month seem higher than acceptable to me.
 On top of that I&#x27;m worried about my friends, I don&#x27;t want to see them in a serious accident in Vietnam, far away from home and without any insurance. 
 They just shrugg it off and say it&#x27;ll be alright and tell me I shouldn&#x27;t worry about it. They don&#x27;t seem to understand the risks. 
 Are my concerns justified? I know it&#x27;s almost impossible to go to Vietnam and not ride a motorbike, but I want them to at least understand the dangers and risks.

                              <span>I know funk and city-pop aren&#x27;t that popular in Vietnam. Many songs aren&#x27;t very funky, and have very structured and rigid melodies.
 The closest I&#x27;ve found is Berlin by Khoi Vu, Fever and Gap May by Wren Evans, and Het Thoi by Ngot. Even then, most of these are pop or other genres.
 ​
 When I search up Vietnamese funk, I can only find songs that don&#x27;t sound funky. 
 Here are some examples of city-pop or funk songs I&#x27;m looking for:
 Flyday Chinatown
 Funky Dealer

                              <span>Hey all. 
 Visiting Vietnam in the next few months and after some recommendations or personal experiences from people on here.
 Mostly like being away from overly touristy places, prefer chill places, meeting local people and getting stuck into the local food culture. Language barrier isn&#x27;t a problem. 
 Is the far Northwest a good place to head off on a motorbike trip, Lao Cai and that whole area Son La etc etc apart from Sapa? Possibly instead of Ha Giang and the more frequented areas. 
 Anyone got any experience in Hai Phong, Dong Hoi, Hue? Or just any other recommendations in general from the far north to the center (visa too short for entire country) 
 Thanks alot appreciate any responses :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m Vietnamese (f22) using WhatsApp and there&#x27;re many accounts with no +234 keeping pm me. It seems that they&#x27;re all men and they try to get to know my basic imformation like my name, hometown, years old, or family. Some time they speak Vietnamese. They said they had my phone number by accident and wished us to be friend together. I wonder is that rude? Are they all foreigner? And what is the truth? I would be grateful with anyone could explain what happened with me.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m travelling to Vietnam next week from the UK and I&#x27;m trying to find out what the exchange rate is when taking money out an ATM. Here in England I get 25k Dong &#x3D; pound (from tescowhich is the best rate I can find). Do you get a more accurate exchange rate inside Vietnam from an ATM? it&#x27;s current about 28k to the pound. Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently living in the United States, and am looking to relocate to live in Vietnam for a couple of years to be closer to family. However, I am a difficult time looking for potential jobs in Vietnam as a Vietnamese American. I don&#x27;t expect to be making as much as I am in the US but looking something comparable. Thanks!
  
Are there high paying jobs for expat in Vietnam? (100k+ USD) 
 What&#x27;s the best way to search for jobs as an expat?

                              <span>I was born in Vietnam but have lived overseas for most of my life. Been trying to get back to my roots and understand the culture better by consuming more Vietnamese modern media.
 There&#x27;s a game show I watch called 2 Ngày 1 Đêm. Originally I enjoyed the show enough, but over the last few episodes, the show&#x27;s use of live animals just doesn&#x27;t sit quite right with me.
 First it was a game to capture duck. Then another game where they toss a whole bunch of mini crabs around to find special ones with numbers stuck to them. But the worst one was in the final episode where they were pulling this poor baby pig around, not with a proper pet harness, but just a piece of rope, then the poor thing got picked up and run around whilst screaming in distress. The sounds of his scream honestly stresses me out.
 Having grown up in Vietnam, I know we still have a long way to go in terms of animal rights, but I did not expect to see animal abuse on national television. Honestly I wonder what other people would think when seeing this on Vietnamese TV. This particular show originates from Korea. The Korean show has hundreds of episodes and animal abuse was never in any of them. How is it that the Vietnamese show cannot produce even 20 episodes without involving distressed live animals, do the producers lack creativity that badly? 😔

 Anyone remembers her? Really miss her songs and emotional voice when she hits the high note.
 According to this website: Dalena, she has not been appearing any big show since 2007 in Asia 55.
 Does anyone know what she is doing? She is still singing?

                              <span>Hi All! This is my first post here.
 I am going to be in Vietnam for a month, starting November 2. I am going to be based in HCMC, but I will be free to move around the country. I have received my fourth dose of COIVD vaccine, and am happy to mask up and to practise social distancing in my home country of Canada, but I am curious to know what people in Vietnam are currently doing regarding COVID protocols. In my part of Canada, it seems many people are now throwing caution to the winds re: COVID. Is the same happening in Vietnam?

 I wanted to ask if there is any public edition (including text version) of Cards Against Humanity card board game: https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/ in Vietnamese?
 Anyone can download template and add their own text, so I was just wondering if anyone tried to create VN version of this game, thanks.

                              <span>Last time I visited VN was during Tet in 2020, and even though it shut down Hanoi for a day (really weird to walk around the old quarter and it was dead) it was a very cool experience to see the festivities and everything going on in Saigon to celebrate.
 This time we&#x27;ll be landing on Christmas day in Hanoi (late at night of course), and we will in Saigon for International New Years eve and day. What should we expect?, are there celebrations?, are day trips still happening? (cu chi tunnels tour type things).
 TIA and looking forward to coming back!!

                              <span>Hi all! My friend and I are visiting Hanoi and HCM some time early to mid December. We understand HCM’s a more comfortable coolish warm weather. For Hanoi, we’ve been reading up and watching videos but we are still quite confused about the weather and is unsure of what to prepare in terms of wear because we’ve read and seen people wearing anything from shorts to padded jackets… 😂
 We understand that the weather can be quite volatile and thus layering is key, but we’d just like to get some sense of what the weather is like in both cities, and whether Hanoi especially requires anything even remotely close to a padded jacket? 
 For context, we come from a tropical climate within SEA! 
 Many thanks! :)

                              <span>While riding all over Vietnam from South to North I would always come across a wedding party, in rural areas, there would be a big tent on the side of the road that would extend out onto one lane of the road. The first time I saw this caught me by surprise as I rode past and suddenly got hit with sonic waves and my ear drums felt like they were about to explode. I almost go blown off my bike. I came across 3 weddings that day so I knew what I was in for. But I have always wondered, why do the have speakers at a wedding reception the Size of a house that are turned up to 100% with 100 guests inside drinking like there is no tomorrow. I&#x27;m sure they are all yelling. Mot Hai Ba Yooooooo.... Is there a reason behind having the big ass sound system that triggers the earthquake richter scale monitors all over Vn.

                              <span>It&#x27;s rather frustrating that some self proclaimed vietnamese &quot;singer&quot; on YouTube have to rip off a song Like literally not edit to make the slightest difference but just copy and paste it https://youtu.be/4NRXx6U8ABQ Here is the original &quot;blinding lights&quot; The copy and pasted one https://youtu.be/4tYuIU7pLmI So hilarious that they still put it up and anyone who comments about it being a ripped off gets their comment deleted This is one of the many cases

                              <span>I&#x27;m in Vietnam for the first time, with my partner.
 We are in Hoi An currently.
 I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not really enjoying it today.
 It&#x27;s way too muggy and hot, the river and city is dirty as hell.
 And there&#x27;s so many scammers and people trying to hustle you.
 There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much to do, and everywhere we have eaten (trying all the top rated places) has been dissapointing.
 What is there to do here really? Drink warm beer, inhale pollution and look at a dirty river? Am I missing something? 
 Anyone have any suggestions please.
 Edit. People asking why I didn&#x27;t plan this properly, this was a last minute change of plans as Japan still didn&#x27;t ease restrictions when we made the switch (they eased restrictions literally 2 days after we changed flights and bookings)

                              <span>My baby boy puppy just died today and we had him cremated. I was wondering what is acceptable in regards to vietnamese views in regards to this subject. 
 Is it ok to keep the ashes in your home? Would buddhist temples bless the remains?
 I asked my mom and sisters but they said they usually dont talk about things like this at the temple or not really sure. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>My boyfriend just spent a month out there in and around HCMC and he really wanted to bring home one of the green grab jackets, but never came across anyone that had one he could buy - he found the helmets but not the jacket :(
 Does anyone know how I could track one down to buy and have sent to the US? I&#x27;d love to surprise him with it
 (If anyone is visiting and can get their hands on one to bring back to the US and ship to me let me know!)

                              <span>It all started when my young brother were in hospital and I visit my young bro with my mom in an old, overcrowded kid hospital near Tan Mai province. After that, my young bro were out of hospital and go home with us, and that’s how problems begins to show up. My mom and dad are the one that hit first, got more coughing and loosing voice (only my dad) and that’s somehow hits me and the entire family with symptoms like fever, headache, muscle pain, eye pain, coughing and puke. Not only my family, even the teachers that I have known in Bien Hoa City were got Covid or got sick. I just don’t know what diseases that caused my whole family to be sick but things were started to get dire when the cases were spreading wild in HCM city. I just don’t know if I got some health to study and doing exam tomorrow but I’m thinking that it’s getting worst.

                              <span>Can anyone suggest how come Francisco de Pina was never granted Honorary citizen of Vietnam?
 After all, coming up with a modern alphabet for a language is no walk in the park.
 Although, Vietnam doesn&#x27;t usually make foreigners citizen of Vietnam, there has been instances where Foreigners have been granted Citizenship:
 https://vietnamnet.vn/en/the-first-foreigner-granted-vietnamese-citizenship-E66920.html
 Or title of &#x27;honorary citizen of vietnam&#x27;:
 https://vovworld.vn/en-US/news/alexandre-yersin-awarded-posthumous-title-of-honorary-citizen-of-vietnam-272608.vov
 Or &#x27;The honorary Citizen of the Capital City&#x27;:
 https://vovworld.vn/en-US/news/former-vietnamrussia-friendship-organization-president-hanoi-is-always-in-my-heart-277455.vov
 Seems odd that Francisco de Pina hasn&#x27;t been awarded any of these.

                              <span>Hi :)
 I&#x27;ll be visiting Vietnam in November. We are planning on travelling from HCMC to Phnom Penh and visiting the Mekong Delta. However I can&#x27;t find any info about 3 or 4 day tours starting in HCMC and ending in Cambodia, that are not luxury cruises which cost 1000+ $ per person. Do you know any websites where I can book those tours? Or do you have any other tips to plan my trip in Mekong Delta?
 Thanks very much! :)

 First of all, I am fully aware of the fact that some East Asian countries like South Korea, Japan have unwritten strict dress codes and it is generally not acceptable for women to wear very short jeans shorts that reveal your legs too much. Its also not accepted if your buttcheeks are visible. As far as I know, women dress very modestly in South Korea and Japan(even during hot summers) to practice modesty.

                              <span>My company is thinking about sending me to Vietnam a few times a year for a project, and rather than bringing my US Verizon number, it was recommended that I get a prepaid Vietnam SIM (such as Viettel, Vietnamobile, etc), keep topping up regularly to keep the number active (so I don&#x27;t have to buy a new one everytime). I&#x27;ve done this successfully when I was stationed in Singapore. 
 Question is, is it possible to have a Viettel (or other VN carriers) SIM registered and shipped overseas (so that I have it prior to my trip), as well as international roaming activated (just so I can receive SMS while overseas)? 
 Thx!

                              <span>Hello--- I&#x27;m a Việt Kiều and I&#x27;ve been researching folk religion partially for a story I want to write. I came across an article (offroadvietnam.com/vietnam-info/customs-and-rites/funerals) about burials that mentioned this: 
 &quot;Sometimes, coffins are temporarily buried in the gardens to discourage thieves from robbing the valuables inside. In the case of young virgin girls, the burial place is often nearby the home so that it can be watched. Some rural people believe that the head of a virgin girl is very valuable and may be conserved and turned into the most powerful and omnipotent talisman through special ceremonies. Persons who have the talisman are believed to be omnipotent and invulnerable.&quot; 
 I found that really intriguing but couldn&#x27;t find anything else referencing that belief online. Has anyone heard of this, or anything related? And are there any keywords that might help me research further? I&#x27;m also curious what they mean by &#x27;rural people&#x27; here...
 Cảm ơn!

 It could be anything from just feeling like it, to having someone recommend it to them or want to see the view, etc... Any answers are greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi everyone! So my husband and I want to travel to Vietnam the next summer but the visa process is very stressful and we are unsure what websites to trust. We are Omani passport holders currently in Canada and we were wondering if Go Viet Travel is a legit website. Has anyone used it before? Also what other websites do you recommend? We are not eligible for an e-visa and the embassy near us says they&#x27;re having some technical issues with online applications, so I&#x27;d appreciate any help. Thank you all!

                              <span>I work at an international school and school from another country will be visiting us for a long weekend. I need to find 3 days worth of activities to fill their time. This could be in Hanoi, or within a few hours.
 I also need to find restaurants that could accommodate a group this large without too much trouble. Most of my favorites could not handle that capacity all at once.
 I would really appreciate your recommendations! Thanks so much.

                              <span>Are there any reputable Vietnamese language schools for English speakers in Vietnam? 
 I live in the United States, but I want to plan a 6 month trip to Vietnam to learn the language and explore the country. My parents are Vietnamese, but I don&#x27;t know how to read, write, or speak Vietnamese. I can understand the Southern dialect about 60% of the time.

                              <span>Hi all! Finally decided to take a vacation for a few days and booked a 6 day trip to Hanoi. I have been to Ho Chi Minh and I really enjoyed it, and friends of mine have told me Hanoi is even better! So I am thrilled to visit but also don&#x27;t know what I should be seeing, eating, experiencing...
 I love culture, good food, good coffee, walking around and sightseeing, an occasional good cocktail, and enjoy the special, unique things that every city has to offer. I will be staying in Old Town, if that helps, but I don&#x27;t mind booking a taxi or any other type of transportation. A friend even recommended I visit Laos from there, for a day or two, which I&#x27;m open to doing.
 Any recommendations are very much appreciated.

 That said, I&#x27;ve now another, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s more of a necessity than an opportunity, to relocate back again indefinitely, but out of the corporate world, 100% on my own.
 Visa and housing are all taken care of, so no issues there. But I&#x27;m more interested in the small things that people had found useful when keeping a significant presence and residence in the US but coming to vn indefinitely.
 Mainly how to effectively bank? Id like to leave all assets in the us with US banks and brokerages and just move funds to vn as needed. I generate my income in USD outside of vn and anticipate keeping it like that. But no doubt will need to bring in large amount of cash to settle down. 
 Which banks work better than others for those with foreign US assets? What credit cards are most efficient/effective?
 Most other aspects are square, but as I said I was living in a financial bubble I didn&#x27;t need to worry about.
 Advice?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have some mesterolone which is a weak steroid used to help alleviate the symptoms of low testosterone. It&#x27;s just a tablet so not injectables or anything. However, I don&#x27;t have a prescription. Will the Vietnamese customs be bothered about me taking in a couple weeks supply? What will happen if they find them? I&#x27;ve heard about extremely strict punishments for taking certain drugs in but it seems that is only for drugs of abuse. I don&#x27;t want to risk ending up in prison!
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am a second-generation viet kieu born in Belgium
 My parents fled Vietnam and settled in Belgium where I was born.
 They both lost their vietnamese citizenship from what I know and are now belgian citizens.
 For my part, I was born and lived in Belgium until recently.
 I speak vietnamese good enough to live in Vietnam on my own and have a vietnamese name.
 ​
 I recently decided to move to Vietnam to live here.
 I am under a 5-year visa exemption and still work remotely for a Belgian company (no work visa then).
 I am considering my options to obtain vietnamese citizenship to settle here for good in the future.
 The dual citizenship is possible from what I know.
 ​
 From what I could find, the easiest way would be to ask one of my parent to regain its vietnamese citizenship first so I can apply as the child of a vietnamese citizen.
 Is there any other solution?
 It is not that they are not willing to do it but since it is my personal decision, I do not want to force them to take the decision to regain citizenship for me.
 Thanks for reading me.

                              <span>Hi! I’m visiting Vietnam looking for a place to bring a gift back from Vietnam for a female family friend. The two cities I’ll be visiting next are Saigon &amp; Nha Trang. This friend is very well off and doesn’t really like tacky items or fakes (knockoffs for name brands). Her style is more classy (eg. pearl jewelry). She doesn’t care about brand names either, so it doesn’t matter about the price.
 I’m trying to find something locally made that’s of decent quality and not tacky - a shawl / scarf, jewelry, etc. that can fit in a suitcase. Any suggestions of stores and / or items? I was initially thinking an ao dai, but I heard these are better when tailored to a person. 
 Thank you for the help :)

 I&#x27;m new to VN, just bought scooter on FB but I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;s stolen? Didn&#x27;t even occur to me -- I feel so horrible &amp; guilty. I took blue crd from seller...yes ik I should&#x27;ve checked it first, but I&#x27;m naive I guess -- so it&#x27;s got the VNese owner&#x27;s info on it. Wht should I do? If I report it, will the bike return to originl owner? If I keep it, will I get in big trouble? I did shell out good money, just weighing out every option. Thx for reply

                              <span>Hey guys! We’re travelling from Phong Nha to Ninh Binh tomorrow by motorbike, but find the drive a bit too far. So, was wondering what would be a good place to stop in between?
 We were thinking of Vinh, but aren’t too sure about it. 
 Are there different places, maybe a bit off the beaten path, halfway from Phong Nha to Ninh Binh maybe? Or would you recommend just to stay in Vinh?

 Hello, I’m taking a bus from Vientiane to Hanoi. I booked a bus that got canceled that entered at cau treo border checkpoint. When I applied for my e visa I put cau treo on there. The new bus enters at Nam Phao checkpoint. Will this be an issue? Thanks.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a Vans style vietnamese sneakers brand. &quot;Designed in Saigon, made in Vietnam&quot;. It&#x27;s dirt cheap, with basic sneakers costing 20USD only !
 ​
 And... They do have big sizes for westerners. I wear 45,5 EU and 45EU was fine, they have up to 46EU with every sizes available in the store I went !
 ​
 Quality wise it&#x27;s better than Vans, the sole is much better.
 I found this by surprise down the street is HCMC, they have several stores there. I highly recommend you checking out. Will definitely buy more pairs to bring back in Europe also.
 ​
 ​
 I don&#x27;t have any affiliation with them but I found that it&#x27;s so cool to buy local brands here, and didn&#x27;t saw any post here or in other expat&#x27; communities talking about this brand, so thought it was worth sharing with you.

 If you know other nice vietnamese brands worth checking out it would be nice if you can share it in the comment section.

                              <span>Not a Karen post! I just wonder if anyone else noticed something similar. 
 I’ve traveled between HCM and Hanoi a lot this summer and have never had any problems with the food, however yesterday was awful at multiple places. I wonder if there is some airport-wide issue that’s happened recently or if yesterday was just a lot of bad luck. 
 Many VN airports have a Lucky Star Cafe and I usually get a sandwich from there. They have the sandwiches on display in a window and you pick one, they take it out and heat it, and hand it over. At Hanoi airport yesterday, I looked at one cafe and all the meat looked super dried out, as if it had been sitting at room temp for hours, or even more than a day. All the meat on all the sandwiches looked like that. I decided to try another location of Lucky Star — same thing: dry, discolored looking meat. I decided to order Burger King instead because it was right next to me and because at least that food is cooked when you order it. 
 The BK fried chicken sandwich was utter shite! It looked like it had been fried at too high of a temperature for not a long time. It looked like a burned brick on the outside and the inside was cold mush. I had to spit it out as soon as I took a bite and I just left. I didn’t even want to try anything else. I am aware I should not have high quality expectations for fast food but it should at least be edible. 
 I got a bottle of water from a third Lucky Star location and all the sandwiches there looked the same as the first two. I just decided not to try anything else at the airport. 
 I know this could be a huge coincidence, but maybe there is a wider issue? Is there some electricity issue fucking with the food equipment? Has there been so little traffic that they haven’t moved their products? This is the only time I’ve had bad food at the airport so it just seemed weird that four different places had food issues. What do you think?

 Some context: We worked for a fishing company together. Him and I would basically fly off a boat and pass off coordinates to the boat we were on whenever we saw large schools of tuna fish. This was basically daily for a year. But he speaks very limited English, good Chinese, and native Vietnamese. I speak vocational Chinese, zero Vietnamese, and native English. Nonetheless, we got along great. We trusted each other enough to venture thousands of miles away from land and 40 miles away from our boat in a small aircraft. When we got back I would relax and he would continue to work his ass off because I am from privilege and he is not. He has a 3 year contract away from his family. I have a 1 year contract.…</span>

                              <span>Hypothetically if I worked for a custom clothing business in the US and wanted to go to Vietnam and help establish a direct supply of clothing to my US business, is this a thing? Are there conventions to meet with distributors? Google keeps showing me consultants but I’d like to be on the ground and involved.
 Anybody have any Vietnam business experience they’d like to share? 
 Sorry if this is a dumb question.

 Thinking about either doing the Hang Va Expedition or Wild Tu Lan Cave Explorer. Any suggestions on which might be better/best and why? I&#x27;m in shape and have lots of hiking experience so expedition length shouldn&#x27;t be a huge issue. TIA &amp; cheers!

                              <span>Beware! This is being discuss among schools in Viet as a get rich quick scam. Friend of mine just lost life savings. Does anyone know anything more about this scam? Looking for more info to pass to the police. Thank you!!
 Hãy coi chừng! Điều này đang được các trường ở Việt Nam bàn tán như một trò lừa đảo làm giàu nhanh chóng. Người bạn của tôi vừa mất tiền tiết kiệm. Có ai biết thêm bất cứ điều gì về lừa đảo này? Tìm kiếm thêm thông tin để chuyển cho cảnh sát. Cảm ơn bạn!!

                              <span>So I only noticed this while living abroad. I don&#x27;t think I have ever known any Vietnamese that are scared of spiders. Sure there are people who are afraid of cockroaches, roaches or even bugs, but I tried to ask all my friends, even ladies, nobody is afraid of spiders.
 But when I was abroad, so many people are scared of them, to the point of yelling, including men (sorry I don&#x27;t mean to judge, I myself hate other bugs too). Of course there are some who will take care of the problem, but when I was there, I was the go-to person to take care of relocating them (I hate killing them because I like that they eat bugs but my wife wants me to kill them all the time 😂)
 So... is it true that generally we Vietnamese are not afraid of spiders? Why?

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m learning Vietnamese because I&#x27;m going there to study in January. I use duolingo to learn vocabulary and else but I also need practice, and I can&#x27;t find any text for beginner or content with subtitles. I found BL but they don&#x27;t have subtitles, and Vietnamese is hard to grasp at the beginning, without any writen support. Do you know where I could find some content with subtitles ? There is nothing on Netflix too.

                              <span>Hi there, I am trying to purchase some item on Shopee Vietnam and would like to have the item delivered to the hotel that i will staying at once i arrive in Hanoi next friday morning. However, i noted that I am required to have a Vietnam phone number for verification before i can do any purchasing.
 Is there any way I can make a purchase without the Vietnam phone number? 
 Item I&#x27;m buying is an simple Ao Dai for guy as I will be having a Vietnam Theme party on the night that I arrive in Hanoi and thought of wearing the Ao Dai as costume. Not sure how common such shops are in Hanoi and the price range of male Ao Dai being sold around the area. Hence decided to shop via Shopee.
 Anyone can help?

                              <span>I’m getting married next year and I want to get some custom ao dai made in Vietnam for myself and wedding party which are affordable and not hundreds of dollars like the US. Based on my past experiences, it seems like the only way to get the best deals is by having relatives order and ship it to you. I’m just wondering if there are any shops in Vietnam that work with overseas brides and how the shipping works. Again, with past experiences, I’m afraid that my packages will get intercepted.

I have a phone that supports esim but all the esim apps and resellers offer lackluster esim plans or they&#x27;re overpriced compared to what I see are available once on the ground in Vietnam. 
 Does anyone know where I can buy a reasonably priced esim? I tried looking for a way to buy directly from Viettel but I couldn&#x27;t figure it out.
 Thanks for any insights or help.

 Then I came across the FULRO group which in French stands for &quot;Front unifié de lutte des races opprimées&quot; or in English &quot;United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races&quot;. From what I have read about FULRO is that they are considered to be a collation of other political ethnic minorities groups, most of them were Chams Hindus and Muslims, Montagnards Christians, and Buddhist Khmer Krom. FULRO was response during the Vietnam War (1964 when America decide to but more military aid to South Vietnam) where the minority&#x27;s groups were feared that both Communist North and Capitalist South gover…</span>

                              <span>My significant other is the daughter of Vietnamese parents that moved to Japan as refugees. The problem is: even though she was born and raised in Japan, Japan does not recognize her as a citizen. The only way for her to receive citizenship in Japan is to work for 3+ years as an office lady and pay the government X amount of taxes. 
 We aren&#x27;t doing that, and recently I received a job in VN.
 Because she doesn&#x27;t have a passport or citizenship anywhere in the world, her visa status will likely be a little difficult to navigate (she has a special visa that allows her to visit Vietnam for 6 month periods but requires her to return to Japan). 
 Has anyone here been in a similar situation? 
 She knows that she won&#x27;t apply for Japanese citizenship (and has little desire to now). So, how difficult would it be for her to apply for Vietnamese citizenship? 
 She speaks Vietnamese fluently and has a Vietnamese name, if that makes a difference.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Can anyone recommend how I spend 2 weeks from South to North. There are way too many cool locations. I will be remote working for 1 week. I don&#x27;t really want to use trains much. The VIP bus I don&#x27;t mind and flying I&#x27;m cool with.
 So far thinking 
 2 days in HCMC ??? 7 days in Hanoi to see Halong Bay and try and do 1 trip to somewhere cool in the north
 I guess there&#x27;s a gap after HCMC but any help would be great thank you.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I booked some internal flights in Vietnam via GoToGate, where they asked me to put &quot;First and Middle Name&quot; in one field, and Last Name in another field.
 I put in the names as instructed, but now when trying to check my booking via VietJet Air&#x27;s website when it requested &quot;Middle and Given Name,&quot; I was only able to actually check my booking after flipping it around as &quot;First and Middle Name,&quot; and the VietJet Air website now lists the name as &quot;LAST NAME FIRST NAME MIDDLE NAME.&quot;
 The issue is I&#x27;ve booked these tickets on the behalf of others, who are Vietnamese citizens, and the names on their passports of course list it as &quot;Last Name Middle Name First Name&quot;, which is different from what&#x27;s on their tickets. Granted, the GoToGate e-ticket also instructs everyone to print the document out where it also has their name printed as LAST NAME/FIRST NAME MIDDLE NAME to bring with them to the airport. Does anyone know/have experience with this if this will cause any issues when receiving their boarding pass at the airport and boarding the plane?

 What sort of digital payment wallet is the most widely accepted?
 Also, is there a platform to convert USD over to VND, or is this something I would really need to go to a bank for? 
 Thanks for any pointers you might have!

 Is riding from Hanoi to Sa Pa then doing the Ha Giang loop then to Cao Bang then back to Hanoi a good decision, or will it be a problem for some reason?
 How many CCs bike can i hire at most with just a car license
 How much roughly will it cost to rent a motorbike for 2 weeks?
 I have some experience riding a motorbike btw
 Also, if you have any other tips regarding riding in north vietnam, please feel free to share :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Halongbaytours.com aka Blue Dragon tours is a scammy tour agency. I booked a tour with the understanding that I can cancel before 30 days and get a full refund. Something came up and I requested cancellation. They have basically ghosted me and didn’t refund my deposit. Luckily I can dispute with my credit card company.
 Companies like these give all Vietnamese tour operators a bad name. I’m surprised that they don’t realize the Internet will amplify bad business practices. They will lose more future business than its worth a small deposit in the grand scheme of things.
 For anyone who book tours, please find a local tour operator on Facebook instead of using any online website Unless it’s a legit International site. Don’t pay any deposit, only pay when you get there.

                              <span>&#x27;Sup guys, so today my flight is departing to Hanoi. I am looking forward to it like crazy. There was one bad thing however today, as I couldn&#x27;t find my driver license anywhere. Which baffles me because I always have it on me in the same card holder. But yeah it&#x27;s gone and that is a real bummer because I was looking forward to renting a scooter or motor to drive around the area. I found a travel blog on the internet however saying that to rent a 50cc scooter you don&#x27;t necesarilly need to show/have a license. The last time I rented one of those in Indonesia it was able to go up to 80 km/hour so that is fine for my needs. So I wanted to check here. Do you have an idea if it is possible to do this without a license? (Just to be clear btw, I do have a license and a lot of experience driving, I just don&#x27;t have the license itself on me while traveling because I didnt have time to get a new card today. )

                              <span>I’ll (20M) be visiting Vietnam for the first time in January with my GF (20F). We are from the US. We’ll be flying into HCMC, where we’ll stay for around a month and then go to Hanoi. I am musician and I write, record and produce my own music. I mainly play Rock and Roll/Indie, but love all types of music. I’ll be bringing a few microphones and equipment to record music, I am trying to gain experience in working with other musicians and making new connections, so if you have a project or a group, I’d love to record it. I’d also love to just talk about music too! I am not sure what the music scene looks like in Vietnam, so any insight into what kind of music and where I can find local music would be helpful. Thanks!

                              <span>My husband and I just finished up three wonderful weeks in Vietnam, I already can&#x27;t wait to go back. However, something weird happened to us while we were in Hanoi, twice two different men tried to grab at my husband&#x27;s shoes. My husband kicked at their hands and they tried to grab his shoes multiple times while muttering something we couldn&#x27;t understand. We managed to get away both times, but I was wondering what would have happened if they had managed to actually get a hold of his shoes? My husband thought they were trying to glue something to his shoe and then have him pay to get it off. Any idea what was going on?

There is a typhoon coming tomorrow and we are wondering where should we go because the weather looks bad in the south as well. We did Hanoi and Halong Bay already, we were wondering if Sapa was worth the trip, and otherwise if you have some recommandations for us ?
 Thank you very much !

                              <span>I live in the US. I&#x27;ve met a wonderful Vietnamese woman this year. I am formally visiting her in December. We want to do a K1 visa, marry in the states, but have the ceremony in Vietnam. From what I&#x27;ve been reading so far, it seems getting a K1 will take a long time. Has anyone gone through a situation similar to this that could give me some suggestions?

They didn&#x27;t understand what I said and was like what.. and told me I need to say &quot;vị&quot; and &quot;mùi&quot; is only for nước hoa. I know &quot;mùi&quot; means scent/smell but I swear I heard it being used when talking about flavors before like &quot;bánh kem mùi gì ngon&quot; or &quot;thôi ăn múi sầu riêng đi&quot; It could be I&#x27;m mixing up my Vietnamese and remembering it wrong. Or it&#x27;s a region thing, something nguoi nam say. Does any ng nam use the word &quot;mùi&quot; for flavor?

                              <span>We have a flight going to Da Nang today and was planning on staying for a few days before heading to HCMC. Should we go to Da Nang? Or head directly to HCMC? We&#x27;re a bit worried about the storm. Our Airbnb is close to the Hilton.

                              <span>You probably know, poking dogs is inherently a risky sport, but this game still has an irresistible attraction to Vietnamese people.
 And for those who don&#x27;t know - please dont try it. This sport requires lots of luck and special skills.
 Especially if you don&#x27;t want to tear your shoes, tear your clothes &#x3D;))) Dogs can bite your shoes even when you are at home, let alone when going out and poke the neighbor&#x27;s dog, right? Haha.
 And if your shoes are bitten and torn, you can bring them to a shoe care store near you to have them sewn.

 I was recently accepted for a very well paid internship in Can Tho! I&#x27;m excited for it, however I wanted to ask what is there to do on free time around the area? Friends from HCMC told me it&#x27;s kinda a sleepy town and there isn&#x27;t much to do. Also general advice on best sim for international calling to USA? Sorry if this is an often repeated question but I would appreciate the help!

                              <span>I&#x27;m an English 27 y/o female living in London. I have a 1st class Fine Art degree and currently studying a PGCE in secondary art and design (post graduate that qualifies me to teach full British GCSE art and design curriculum and A-level). I have teaching experience in art and geography. I recently started a beginners Vietnamese course with SOAS. 
 I was preparing to move to Vietnam to teach English and COVID hit, which pressed me to study my post grad and become an art teacher.
 I want to live the rest of my 20s and onwards in a beautiful exciting country, to immerse myself in a new culture, learn a new language, to grow and truly live. I want to really take some time to move to a country to study to make my best attempt at learning the language, meeting new people and also to rent a studio to have the time to develop my art practice. 
 Here in UK I&#x27;m seasonally depressed 6 months of the year, overworked to afford to get by and uninspired and to be honest I&#x27;ve always felt this way about life here. 
 The reason I chose to study to become an art teacher is in some desperate hope that I might be able to utilise these skills and find work in an international school abroad as a British curriculum art teacher or gain a residency visa back to Australia (closer to Vietnam at least). Don&#x27;t get me wrong I do love working with young people.
 Working as an art teacher in London is something like £35k a year. But honestly I&#x27;d take a sickening pay cut to move and have more time to truly live. International schools in vn seem few and far between that need art teachers. I would obviously very much love to keep progressing with my art related career, as it&#x27;s my specialism and love but I would consider teaching English if It means I have more time off and have enough money to work on my art and take Vietnamese lessons. 
 Thoughts anyone? What kinds of jobs/hours/pay What do you think my prospects will look like if I move to Vietnam. 🇻🇳🍵

                              <span>As the title says, what is the best officially recognized Vietnamese language course that is available in Hanoi?
 a bit of backstory: In 2020 I decided to change careers and return to university. I am doing it all online through a university that is outside of Vietnam. 2021 I got an online job that allowed me to get through covid times. My employment contract there ends at the end of January 2023.
 Having worked from home for the last two years, my Vietnamese skills have diminished a lot, and they weren&#x27;t that good to begin with. 
 I have a year until my university degree is finished and I then plan to reenter the workforce, but until then, I have two options: return to my extremely expensive home country where I will need to finish my studies and work at the same time, due to cost of living OR continue my online studies here while also studying Vietnamese.
 My online studies are in a field that I am already quite knowledgeable in, so I am kind of bored to be honest. And on top of that, I have a lot of free time. So I would much prefer to stay here and study Vietnamese and live off of the savings for a year before returning to work.
 The last point to add, my fiancée (also a foreign national) and I are getting married, so I could return once that paperwork is finished but her countries government makes that of Vietnam look like a well oiled machine, so I don&#x27;t want to rely on that. 
 TLDR: I have a year off and would prefer to stay in Vietnam to study than go home to my home country. What are the best options?

I&#x27;ll be paid the same amount as I would in western countries for my role that would be right below that of the expat country manager&#x27;s. What websites should I be looking at before I negotiate my compensation package?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has experience getting a licence to legally drive / ride a scooter in Vietnam?I&#x27;m headed over to Da Nang later this year, planning to stay for some months by doing border runs with tourist e-visas. Thinking that it&#x27;ll be fun to ride over there and explore around the city and surrounding areas. Also get the impression VN has pretty intense traffic accident rates, so I&#x27;m keen to get insurance that covers this in case I get caught out - need to be driving legally to be covered though. I&#x27;m a New Zealander who is licensed to drive legally in my own country, but I guess I need to upgrade this somehow to ride over there. Do any foreigners have experience getting licensing to ride legally in Vietnam?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I&#x27;m currently in HCMC (from the US) and my Mac refuses to charge. When plugged in, it stays at its current percentage but won&#x27;t go any higher. It also feels very staticky so I&#x27;m keeping it unplugged for the time being. Is there anything a can buy so I can charge my laptop? I&#x27;ll be in Vietnam for the rest of the month. Also if anyone knows a specific place to buy what I need would be appreciated too. I&#x27;m in D1 if it helps. I&#x27;ve attached a picture of the outlet at my Airbnb. 
 Thanks!
 Update: I left my MacBook on plugged in while I was away and it continued to charge even though it says not charging. I believe the issue is the charger so I&#x27;ll try to buy a new one tomorrow. Thanks everyone!!

 Hello, 
 My name is ____, and I am a student at New York University. I am applying for an academic fellowship that emphasizes work in human rights and volunteerism. I have chosen your organization, VAVA because I am passionate about environmental activism and combatting the detrimental effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam. 
 I only require your written consent in an email to reference your organization in my application. 
 Thank you for taking the time to read my email. 
 Enjoy your day,

                              <span>I arrived in HCM a week ago, and will be here for a year. I’ve been getting stuck into the awesome food here, from all sorts of places.
 I ended up getting pretty ill last night, so much so i spent the night on drip due to dehydration. Turns out a triple whammy of e-colo, salmonella and cholera were the culprits!
 I cant quite pin down what might have cause it, as I say, ive been indulging. But any food/drink stuff you’d advise to stay away from to avoid this in the future? Im not drinking tap water, but aside from that havnt avoided anything yet. Cheers!

                              <span>I see so much about tourism numbers in the Vietnamese news and then one line at the bottom will say that the country now allows people from 80 countries get an e-visa. But it&#x27;s never made clear that this a massive downgrade from before when far more countries could get their visa letter online.
 How do you feel about this? Do you care that you&#x27;re shutting out over half the world&#x27;s countries, for what is ostensibly, no reason?

                              <span>How come celebrities don&#x27;t come to Vietnam to perform? I&#x27;m talking about Western artists/Kpop idols. I know a few years back Blackpink performed in Hanoi, but they&#x27;re not coming back for their new world tour. I&#x27;m just using them as an example because I have not seen any big name artist come to Vietnam recently ... why is that? 
 I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a covid thing, but other Southeast Asian countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines) have a lot of big artists performing there so maybe it&#x27;s not that. 
 Is it a popularity thing? Just curious because I love attending concerts and it&#x27;s just sad I won&#x27;t be able to hear live music from my favorite artists when I spend my time in Vietnam.

                              <span>I got scratched by a dog in Hanoi, Vietnam. Seemed to be a puppy (or a miniature breed), since it was playful. It ran up to me and tried jumping on my legs, then ran away. Not aggressive. It was sitting by a store and looked healthy &amp; clean, but had no collar on it.
 The scratch didn’t visually bleed and I don’t see broken skin, but it left a white line (like when you scratch your own arm with your nail). The dog also licked my leg (no visible open wounds, but I had shaved that morning so you never know).
 Do I need to get post exposure rabies shots, or am I being paranoid? Sorry in advance if this is incredibly stupid. I lived a part of my childhood in India, where rabies is a big deal.

                              <span>I 27m American am going to fly to Hanoi in November. I have never taken an international flight before I know I have to get a visa has it been easy to get one on site recently? 
 What should I know about finding a good place to stay and rest my head. How do I know what are the bad areas of town?
 I have a friend 35f VNese who wants me to visit w her. Is there anything I should know that could be a legal issue? Vì du: in Muslim countries a man and a woman if not married or family can’t have a hotel room together. 
 What is the to do in Há nội and what is there to do in Vinh. I like to eat VNese food because I have a few Viet kiểu friends who introduced me to like bun rieu and bun Bo hue. I’m creative sometimes and I love nature.
 Any and all feedback is appreciated.

                              <span>Srs help needed for Central Vietnam Trip.
 In Short, I am arriving in Vietnam (Central &amp; North) for 18-21days. I am coming in to DN first.
 However, I just noticed that it is the rainy season &amp; i didn&#x27;t expect Hoi An/DN/Hue to be flooded that badly. As you can see my past post history, others have mentioned that the flood generally come and go quickly and 99% of the cities/ tourist spot are still accessible.
 After seeing the news on DN/Hue ytd and today, I am even more worried and really need some advice here from the viet community. (I have done my research online and reddits alrdy to prevent overposting, but i really need some assurance and guidance. Hope my post doesnt get removed).
 ​
 Q1) How true is it that the flood doesnt impact 99% of the cities and tourist spot are generally accessible?
 Q2) If it rains heavily, How long does the flood takes to recede so that I can travel off?
 Usually, Are the railway trains station still accessible during floods?
 Q3) Even tho, it is hard to predict the likelyhood of floods, &amp; I can still visit the 7-14days weather forecast. But if the city (DN/Hoi An/ Hue) has already flooded before, and the typhoon/storm heads somewhere else, are they still prone to flooding?
 Q4) Aside from weather forecast, what can i search on to warn myself of upcoming flood?
 Q4) Are the northern Vietnam safe from flooding? So i can change my plans?
 ​
 This is my first 20+ days trip to vietnam, and i really didn&#x27;t foresee this coming. Appreciate many help

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am visiting Vietnam next month and was wondering if I should book Vietjet flights. They are quite inexpensive as compared to others. How has your experience with them been? The official Vietjet website looks somewhat funny to me and I want to be sure that it&#x27;s a reliable airline. If there is some problem with the flight on their end (delay/loss of baggage/cancellation of flight/whatever else), will travel insurance take care of it?
 Would appreciate advice/suggestions/narration of your own experiences with the airline.
 Thanks a ton!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am planning a short trip to Tokyo (from Noi Bai) and I was wondering which airline was recommended. 
 I have heard/read very negative stories about Vietjet so I was thinking of going with a different carrier like Hahn, but I think that they are operated by Vietjet anyway? 
 I&#x27;m seeing options with Vietnam airlines also but they have layovers in SGN, I would prefer a direct flight. 
 Any opinions? Is Vietjet really that bad?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 My GF and me are currently in Da Nang. At least where we are staying Da Nang ist flooded.
 Tomorrow morning we have a flight to Hanoi at 8:30.
 In the evening we hope to catch our flight back to Germany at around 18:30.
 Are here any people from Da Nang that can tell me how high our chances for our flight to Hanoi to take off?
 Thanks in advance, you guys really helped us with our travel. We really enjoyed our first trip to vietnam.

                              <span>Đồ biểu sau thể hiện các giai đoạn ba loại chữ viết chính của tiếng Việt được sử dụng. Theo các dữ kiện lịch sử thì:
 • Chữ Hán được cho là bắt đầu được sử dụng ở Việt Nam khi Thái Thú Sĩ Nhiếp dạy thi thư cho người Việt vào khoảng năm 200.
 • Chữ Nôm có văn tự sớm nhất từ thời nhà Lý, xuất hiện đầu tiên trên các chuông chùa từ năm 1076.
 Cả chữ Hán và chữ Nôm đều không còn được sử dụng rộng rãi từ sau kỳ thi Hội cuối cùng ở Việt Nam năm 1919.
 • Chữ Latin được chính thức sử dụng trong các công văn ở Việt Nam theo nghị định do Phó Đề đốc Marie Gustave Hector Ohier ký từ năm 1869.
 Có thể thấy, chữ Latin là loại chữ viết còn khá trẻ của tiếng Việt.
 Các bạn nghĩ sao về các loại chữ viết của tiếng Việt?

                              <span>I just recently accepted an offer to work in Hanoi, and will move there next year from California with my wife and kid. We don&#x27;t have much stuff, but we feel so strongly about the toys of my kid which in total can go up to 200 lbs (~100 kg). I wonder if anyone who has sent such a large amount of stuff to Vietnam could give me some tips ? I did research on the Internet but there are so many companies and there aren&#x27;t a lot of reviews. Thanks.

                              <span>I have been using a MacBook Air for 8 years (before that Windows), and now it would die soon, so I am thinking of what’s next.
 I mostly use for office purposes: email, word, excel, research on web and posting on a Wordpress website, a bit of resizing pictures or joining videos, but not much.
 I like touch screen Windows but it sounds like Mac is more durable and more smooth? I have an iPhone so it’s convenient to use with Mac but it’s just a 6s I got for free. What I don’t like about recent Mac is the USB port.
 So what do you guys use? MacBook/Windows/Linux and how’s your experience? Anyone use surface? Anyone use iPad with keyboard instead of a laptop?

                              <span>Hey all,
 I recently came back from a 4 month trip in Vietnam where I cruised along with hotels and airbnbs. Yes it got slightly out of hand and my budget grew.
 I work remotely and I’ve decided to try living in Vietnam longer term. I have a 5 year visa and I need to exit the country every 6 months which is fine because visit family and friends back home. 
  
 I am figuring out the right visa for me… Even though I can stay in the country for 6 months on a tourist visa. But I’m confused? 
  
I want to rent a high rise serviced apartment with 2 rooms close to the center. Is US$600 per month enough? 
 I don’t plan to party and drink (as much as I did last trip) and I’m more focused on really understanding the motherland. I want it to be more meaningful and I create real, lasting friendships. 
 So I plan to budget US$500-800 for spending money for everything I need per month.
 I’m extremely interested in investing and entrepreneurship here in Vietnam. So I’d like to start a business here. 
 I leave in December again. I’m getting travel insurance etc. visa, passport and everything renewed. 
 Any tips are welcome! Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, spending two weeks in South Vietnam in December and from my research I&#x27;ve only found recommendations mostly for North Vietnam. Not much on the South. Flying into ho chi, does anyone have some heavily recommended places to go?
 Looking to do two places, a week in each unless it&#x27;s worth doing more splits.
 Mainly after beaches, attractions and good food, bars and restaurants also appreciated

                              <span>Hey guys! I hope you are doing well.
 So early next year I am going to visit Vietnam, but I only have 7 days do explore the country. I know, 7 days is nothing in a country such as this.
 I am going to start in Ho Chi Minh, for the first 2 days, then I was thinking of taking an overnight train/bus to start making my way up to Hanoi. 
 Other than Ho Chi Minh, I would like to visit Halong Bay, or Ninh Binh, or maybe both. Then I would like to go up to the Mount Fansipan (highest point), then obviously visit Hanoi too.
 Is this doable? Do you guys have any recommendations for me?
 Thank you so much!
 All the best.

                              <span>I am with a charity that helps newly arriving refugees. One of the things we do is provide 2 weeks of groceries to help tide them over till benefits and jobs kick in. Sometimes our volunteers provide the groceries. Sometimes people give us money and we do a grocery pickup for the case worker. 
 Will you help me create a list of basics that they may want in their kitchen? Keep in mind that the food is limited in Walmart - for example, I can&#x27;t get rice noodles most of the time, so food that can be substituted is important. They will have nothing in their kitchens and we can&#x27;t provide everything so knowing what foods are more common/used more is better than having a big variety of things. Meats, grains, produce spices, condiments, etc.

                              <span>My parents decided to support my backpacking trip here in their own way, they gave me 100 dollars with one condition: &quot;spend it on something unique that you would never ever spend your own money on&quot;
 Souvenirs, hotels, food, vehicle, experiences, anything goes! A good story for the grandkids later.
 This is a lot of money for me, so by no means do i mean to waste 100 dollars on shots or something. What would you do given the same condition?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve followed a few posts in this sub but i can&#x27;t find an official government site saying that the covid travel insurance is no longer required. 
 I initially didn&#x27;t really plan to go vietnam but im thinking maybe visiting for a couple of days.
 Any idea?

 I&#x27;ve read the translated lyrics, and it&#x27;s such a fun and happy tune/music. 
 Are there any other similar Vnmese music?
 Thanks, cam on rat nhieu~

                              <span>I see many myths perpetuated both here and in daily life. This happens with all languages (see endless arguments on YouTube about Tamil/Sanskrit/Chinese being &#x27;the oldest language&#x27;, a nonsensical notion).
 Some typical myths:
 - Vietnamese grammar is &#x27;backwards&#x27; compared to English/other language of choice (or just difficult in general)
 - Vietnamese has many words/syllables/etc. with different meanings (making it difficult)
 - The Vietnamese writing system is difficult and &#x27;needs&#x27; to be reformed
 Just off the top of my head, I have seen and heard these three very recently. If I sat down and thought/researched I could list many more.
 The problem is that none of these claims mean anything in isolation. Many words with different meanings---compared to what language? Difficult writing system---compared to what other writing systems? And where&#x27;s the evidence? There is never or very rarely any evidence or standards of comparison given. As a linguist I could go into detail on these issues, but I&#x27;d rather see what other people have to say first.
 Now flame me and tell me why I&#x27;m wrong.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ll be in Hanoi in early November and am planning to do a day-trip to Halong Bay. Was wondering if anyone had recommendations on any day cruises? Thanks! :)

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m back in Vietnam for a few months as a break and to attend my cousins wedding in late November. I was born in Vietnam but left at a very young age and a dual citizen of both countries. I&#x27;ve made the stupid mistake of applying for an ID which means now that my name is in the system and they&#x27;ve just called me up for a health checkup tomorrow for conscription in 2023 as I&#x27;m 23yo and the age of conscription is until you&#x27;re 27 (as I&#x27;ve recently found out).
 Has anyone been through this before? Is there any way to get out of this since I&#x27;m a dual citizen or would I have to leave the country ASAP, I did enter on my Vietnamese Passport. My mum is convinced if they conscript me I&#x27;ll lose my Australian citizenship.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate some advice or if anyone could recommend me a good lawyer in Hanoi regarding this matter, thank you.

                              <span>Hello all! 
 Anyone knows what are the requirements for an American citizen and a Vietnamese citizen to get married and apply for the Vietnam 5-year visa exemption certificate? 
 Especially, any income or jobs requirements if we want to live in Vietnam for around 5 years? I assume the Vietnamese spouse has to earn a certain amount of income to sponsor the American spouse. 
 Any advices and personal experiences are greatly appreciate! Just wanna get a general idea of what we will need to deal with :)

                              <span>Would love to know what are thoughts from different age groups of Vietnam locals about developing advanced economy, despite all the problems mentioned in different industry articles.
 My core part at work is a radical shift in commerce / production &amp; supply chains with innovating incentives for companies, employees and end customers / consumers that adopts to clean tech driven supply chains; be it food, healthcare, renewables, electronics, FMCG, sales through new B2B, B2C channels, services, EVs etc.
 I personally love the creative designs from Vietnam that uses natural biofibers (bamboo, hyacinth etc.) &amp; overall designs. They are at par with details from Japanese, Chinese, Thailand&#x27;s creative arts - a mix of tradition, nature &amp; modern.
 I also got surprised by recent developments &amp; announcements by Vingroup EV making in US for US customers. &amp; at the same time, I wonder why MSMEs (Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises) of Vietnam are not gearing up faster at global stage. 
 For example, I never see them at industrial trade shows of the West (US, EU) or even at the East (digital or physical attendance), even though products are pretty good &amp; innovative. Lets say Amazon SEA summit in Singapore, there are zero Vietnamese companies / MSMEs.
 Few of them are on Alibaba, but finding other MSMEs is hard as Alibaba is not that connected with new development outside of China, and the restrictions etc. makes it more complicated. 
 Also, few good points from my research are repeated in this article: on Vietnam + ASEAN region since most of our suppliers at work are looking at ASEAN countries for shifting their production from China.

She&#x27;s telling me that the delivery guy can&#x27;t just drop it off at her house if they can&#x27;t get in contact with her. She said they usually call the recipient to pick it up and if they don&#x27;t respond, they cant deliver the package?? The site didn&#x27;t let me put a phone number in so idk how tf thats gonna work lol 
 If they can&#x27;t contact the recipient do they just take it back to the post office and she would have to pick it up herself?

I do not plan to have a checked bag for this particular domestic flight and just travel with a carry-on. But, I have quite a bit of toiletries items that exceed the US TSA liquid rule. Do the Vietnam domestic flight have a rule on liquid in carry-on? Many thanks!

                              <span>Okay, so I’m learning about Vietnam for my French class right now and we’re discussing the “Boat People” or the refugees who fled the country after the end of the war in ‘75. So this to me seems a bit sketchy (I identify as between socialist and ML). Who were the people that fled, just former bureaucrats for the south and sympathizers, or just your average Joe. What were the education centres? Disguised prisons or actual places where people learned about socialism? Overall, is it justified in calling Vietnam authoritarian post war and were the people justly fleeing the nation, or was it just propaganda and actual crimes of those who fled that caused the exodus

 Is it best to stay in the Ha Long center, or is the islands better?

I know revolt has tracking on it, but I’d still like a reliable place. Is it as simple as finding a post office on Google maps and using that as an address?
