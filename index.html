                              <span>I&#x27;m planning to go to Vietnam in December and was wondering if its worth doing the Ha Giang loop late December. I am from Canada but still would like the trip to be enjoyable so not sure if it&#x27;s worth checking out at that time. 
 Has anyone here done it in December?

 What options are there to obtain a birth certificate from the authorities in HCMC?

The dates on the package are fine, but the juice smells and tastes really bad. Is it possible to return it to the store? I don&#x27;t have a receipt and bought it at a corner store.

                              <span>So I was born and raised in vietnam and lived there for 11 years until I moved to US. When I was there I didn’t mind the heat as much but I noticed my relative sweating bucket when they came back to visit. Now that I lived in US for majority of my life and finally decide to come back, I figured I’m gonna struggle from the heat, so what can I do about it? 
 Also what is the best place in vietnam with the best weather? One of my destination is Hoi An for a wedding but I’m open to suggestion for more places as I haven’t really planned the trip out yet.

                              <span>I live on the 18th floor, yet all kind of bugs keep appearing at my house. Flies visit me the most, and they are always as big as a bee. I tried closing the windows, but it seems that they&#x27;ve already laid eggs in my house. Recently, I&#x27;ve found more and more little flies and other weird bugs near the kitchen and the trash can. How to get rid of them once and for all? Traps and poison are also good, but I think some of the insects have evolved, the cockroaches wouldn&#x27;t fall for the classic Japanese capsule poison anymore help

 In my country, we have two very popular games called &quot;thumb war&quot; and another one called &quot;rock, paper, scissors.&quot; These games are easy to play and don&#x27;t require any materials, and they are so much fun. I was wondering if people in Vietnam are familiar with these two fun games, and how common they are. If not, what are some other popular games people in Vietnam like to play? I am looking forward to learning more about some exciting and fun Vietnamese games that are very popular

 A lot of Vietnamese (here on Reddit) hate Vietnamese Americans because we are anti-communist and accuse us as traitors. While Vietnamese Americans accuse Vietnamese in Vietnam as brainwash idiots.
 However, if we lived in each other shoes, we would probably do the same thing that each side accuses each other off doing. 
 If you lived through the war and saw your people murder and torture by the communist government regardless if you are from Northern or Southern Vietnam, you would not be pro-communist. Similarity, if all you learned in school was the Vietnam War (American War) from the perspective of the winner (North Vietnam), then your view will be in favor of the current regime. 
 Our views, experiences, attitudes, behaviors are shaped base on the context of our lives and those of our families. 
 But one thing that we can agree on is that we want Vietnam to become a develop country.

 I am trying to figure out whether Bằng Tốt Nghiệp Trung Học Phổ Thông (which I understand to mean secondary school certificate of graduation) would qualify someone for admission to universities in other countries, like the US or Canada. In other words, is Bằng Tốt Nghiệp Trung Học Phổ Thông equivalent to a high school diploma? Or do students from Vietnam have to do a gap year before they can attend university abroad? I&#x27;m getting vague/conflicting info when searching it.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Heading to Vietnam next month and looking to do an all day/overnight cruise experience. The options are overwhelming and most posts in this sub were outdated so looking for refreshed recommendations on what cruise line or location is preferable. Thanks so much in advance!

                              <span>Help, the Vietnamese Embassy in Canada is on Covid-19 hours and available for mail ins only. Meaning I cannot reach anybody by phone or email. Have been trying in fact since the summer.
 Now however they have received my documents as of yesterday, but have not charged my bank yet for their legalization and translation fees.
 Would really like some confirmation on cost and expected processing times until I have the documents in my possession again.
 Planning to visit VN this December beginning on the 19th, but prices for airfare are only going up.
 Need some information so I can continue planning my trip.
 Anyone know how to reach someone at the Vietnam Embassy here in Canada?

                              <span>Chào các bạn!
 I am a 21yo &amp; half vietnamese, half european (french &amp; italian). I both have vietnamese and european features (&amp; nationalities). I principally lived in France, and I did not learn vietnamese when I was younger, I knew a little from previous trips. I am currently Việt Nam for 3 months by myself (it&#x27;s been more than 2 months now) and I am speaking a lot better, can hold conversation. Somehow, most of the people here see me as a foreigner. When I approach them (bằng tiếng việt) they stare at me &amp; hit me with the &quot;tây ạ?&quot; and ask me why I can speak vietnamese. I have to explain myself pretty much every time to anyone speaking to me, &amp; also not to have the tourist prices haha. Also every time I go to the countryside, everyone stares at me like &amp; talk about me like I don&#x27;t understand them lol.
 ​
 It hurts me as I always considered myself vietnamese, as I lived with my việt kiều mom most of my life and growing up w vietnamese culture, I feel very vietnamese to put it simple haha. It starts to make me feel a bit sad, &amp; even sometimes I feel wrong not to look viet enough &amp; don&#x27;t feel like I belong to this community. Everybody in France can tell I am asian from my features, but here I am a foreigner to them.
 ​
 Do you have any tips on how to approach this situation? Does anybody have been through the same experience? I think it would make me feel better to know that I am not alone in this. 
 ​
 Cảm ơn mngười! :)

They drove like they were in Formula 1. I still can&#x27;t belive all bus driver drive that fast in road with so many curves and no good sight in front of them (even during the night) Help me to understand :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m staying for 3 months, originally rented a place already. When I arrived, everything was not as advertised and/or broken and the landlord hangs up on me. I need to find a new place to stay soon.
 I am looking for a place with 2 rooms, already furnished, kitchen, wifi, and a/c. 
 I see that the posts here usually say to look on facebook but can someone recommend me some groups? 
 As for district, probably 5,8,10? but I am open to other districts as well.
 Has anyone rented a place similar to what I am looking for? What does it usually cost? Please give me an idea of what to expect in cost to rent!
 I&#x27;ve asked around and see that a lot of places only allow you to rent if you plan to stay for 6 + months. I would rather have it month by month since I don&#x27;t want to run into the same issue I am having now with my current place.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Because Vinfast is popular in Vietnam with the Vinfast Fadil being one of the best sellers in the past three years, do you think Vinfast would be popular towards Vietnamese Americans, given the fact there are many Vietnamese Americans who are anti-communist (like many of my mother&#x27;s relatives who live in the US)?
 Also, I am curious if Vietnamese Americans are willing to buy a Vinfast or would they choose another car (like a Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Volvo, Porsche, VW, Polestar, GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, etc)? For me, even though I was born in Vietnam and currently live in the US (my parents still live in Vietnam however), I am not thinking of getting a Vinfast as there are many EVs which offer better value for the money, in my opinion (like Hyundai Ioniq 5, where there is a better brand cachet).

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I am friend with a girl who was born in Vietnam. She came in Europe when she was very very young and she doesn&#x27;t know nothing of Vietnamese language. Her name is &quot;Thai Ha&quot;. We searched the meaning of her name but without any result.
 Is it a popular name in Vietnam? What does it mean?

                              <span>I am traveling to Vietnam and looking to connect with native wood carvers. I’d also love to carve some spoons out of local “green” wood. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

                              <span>I did a DNA test a couple of years ago and it surprisingly showed 22% Vietnamese. I have no known connection to the country and have never visited. Is it mental I find myself wanting to read about Vietnam? Just would like to know if you guys think 22% is an insignificant amount?

                              <span>Hello. For years I&#x27;ve been using a Garmin 66i for my hiking across Europe and North America. I recently started travelling to Vietnam for work, spending weeks at a time there (4 trips this year already, 82 days in country total - just since August). I brought my 66i and I&#x27;ve been doing hikes with some of the locals on the weekends. It&#x27;s been amazing. However, I&#x27;ve come to find that my Garmin has almost no detail about any of the areas I hike in. No trails, no contour, no roads. Many times it is blank. It&#x27;s fine for tracking where I go, should I need to find my way out, but it&#x27;s a pain to try and plan or navigate some of our hikes when I can&#x27;t really see what is out there.
 I checked Garmin&#x27;s website and there&#x27;s no maps to purchase. There seems to be third parties selling SE-Asia maps but I can&#x27;t really get a read on how trustworthy they are.
 Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations? I&#x27;m heading back out in a few weeks for a 6 week trip, one week of which we&#x27;ll be going deep into the woods in northern Vietnam for 4 nights 5 days hiking and exploring caves. I&#x27;d like to have my garmin properly giving me information.

                              <span>Hey guys! 
 We&#x27;re visiting Vietnam during the second week of December. We&#x27;ll be going directly to Tuan Chau harbour from the Airport. We are five of us and prefer to have a taxi ? Any idea where we can book it from and how much it would cost ? The cruise company is charging us 180 USD for one time transfer which seems quite excessive
 Can you&#x27;ll recommend any options ?

                              <span>I’m 24 and grew up having my parents and relatives speak to me in Vietnamese but I would always respond in English. I would say I know very elementary statements but don’t know much about the grammar or past/future tenses. So assume I know little to no Vietnamese to begin with. And now I’m visiting Vietnam at the end of the year and want to be able to carry small conversations with relatives, restaurant/store workers, etc. does anyone have any tips on learning basic conversational vocabulary and pronunciation?

                              <span>Hi there! My name is Michael.I&#x27;m a certified English teacher from the United States. I have an English language club!
 I&#x27;m looking for people who want to practice conversational English by talking about interesting topics and hanging out with people from all over the world in a small online group for FREE.
 📷 We meet via Zoom(or Gather : a Metaverse platform) for 1 hour and consists of 3 different rounds
 📷 Each round has different topics and discussion questions
 📷 Each round, the groups are randomly mixed, so you will have a chance to talk to different people every time
 📷 This isn&#x27;t just about practicing English, but also about listening to different opinions and learning about different cultures in safe space
 📷 Over 16 years old
 📷 Minimum level : lower intermediate
 P.S We are running this gathering with volunteer native English speakers and people from all around the world. So participation is free.
 Please DM me &quot;english practice&quot;, if you are interested!

                              <span>Hi, had a guide take me and my partner on a private tour to the tunnels and to the Mekong. It was a full day private tour from HCM. 
 I don’t want to cause any offence and want to tip him and the driver. (I’m on the way back now) 
 Is for example 500000 Dong the right amount / too much / too little? 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi, I am planning to visit Vietnam soon, and it occurred to me that New Years Eve is approaching soon, and I was wondering if this is a good time to visit Vietnam.
 I am interested in meeting local people, not so much interested in simply partying and getting plastered with other expats/tourists. Are the local people of Vietnam keen on hanging out for NYE celebrations? Or is the lunar new year more popular of a holiday in VN?
 Also, what are some good ways to meet people and learn about the people and culture in VN? From what I&#x27;ve read, if you look like a foreigner (I am 190cm white guy from America lol) people will talk to you if they see you eating by yourself and are generally quite friendly. Is this true? I&#x27;d love to meet people and feel warm and welcome, unlike when I went to Australia and it felt almost the same as America--super lonely and hard to meet people.

Youtube channel or Seinfeld/Friends etc where I know all the words and Acts, English so it&#x27;s 2nd nature for me when I hear it in a foreign language and can interpret it in my head.
 Currently using some apps to learn too but it&#x27;s more enjoyable to watch a show and learn the language

 My English is not so good, so this topic is Vietnamese. If you are a foreinger, you can use the translation tool. Moreover, it might be a controversial topics about religion, so you can skip this topic. Thanh you a lot for reading my confession.

 Thực sự thì các ông có khó chịu khi thấy người thân, bạn bè thân thiết hay thậm chí là người yêu mình tin và theo đạo không?
 Cái gì cũng có mặt tốt và mặt xấu, và thường thì xã hội hay lan truyền và phát tán mặt xấu nhiều đến mức mặt tốt bị lu mờ. Bố tôi cũng biết rõ cái gì cũng có tốt và xấu, nhưng điều đó lại không thay đổi được thành kiến của ông đối với tôn giáo, nhất là đạo Phật.

                              <span>Dear all, 
 I have lived and worked in Vietnam for the last 5 years. But recently I have been denied entry to Vietnam and I don&#x27;t know why. I left Vietnam to get a TRC which requires foreigners to leave Vietnam and come back on a business visa in order to obtain a TRC. However I have been denied by Hanoi immigration due to a &#x27;immigration violation&#x27;. 
 I still do not know exactly what the problem is and how to fix it! I am more than happy to pay a fine. I have tried many times to call and email Hanoi immigration but still no reply. I even visited Vietnam embassy in Thailand and London but they couldn&#x27;t help. 
 Is there anyone that can help me or give me a contact with someone that works in VN immigration so I can speak to them directly and fix this problem. 
 I have wasted a lot of money and time on agents who take my money under many promises but then do not help at all!
 I am a British citizen and currently living in London. I appreciate any help and kind of desperate as I have all my clothes, my jobs, my apartment, everything still in Saigon :( 
 Thank you all

I want to get a suit and I hear Ho Chi Minh is the place to do it, As I fly out of Ho Chi Minh on the 6th of December, I figure my best shot is to get fitted and order it as soon as I arrive tomorrow.
 Can anyone give me any tips or recommendations on places to get it done?! Would be very helpful.

 What is a good area to stay?
 Which app is best for taxis? In Thailand I use Bolt and In Driver, can I use those?
 I&#x27;m interested in doing some shopping at local markets for clothes etc. . Any recommendations?
 I appreciate any tips you all have. Thank you!

 Moving to Saigon in February and want to carry on kickboxing or start muay thai etc.
 All of the gyms I have found online, the prices are pretty crazy. I understand I&#x27;ll probably find inflated prices but to pay 200 - 300 dollars a month is quite a shock haha.
 Does anyone have any recommendations of mma/ muay Thai/ kickboxing gyms that are not expat traps?
 Again, Im not expecting to pay local prices.
 Any help is appreciated 🙏

                              <span>I usually fly to Vietnam between June and August, so I always knew what to pack in terms of clothing. This time I’m flying in February and now I’m not really sure how to prepare because my cousins said that it’ll be really really cold but on the internet they said it’ll be alright. Should I pack some additional hoodies?
 I’ll be in Hanoi/ Ha long the whole month

                              <span>Hi Everyone!
 I’m off to Vietnam for 5 weeks in December
 I’m looking for some recommendations for gyms to train in. I enjoy powerlifting so would like to squat, deadlift and bench whilst I’m out there
 I’m travelling to the following locations:
 Hanoi Ninh Bing Hoi An Nha Trang Ho Chi Minh
 Thanks!

 ​
 Have I been scammed ? And even if I have been scammed, are my postcards going to arrive at their destination ? Thank you in advance for your answers ! https://ibb.co/grHDSFW

I grew up with my white parent and rarely see my Vietnamese family due to distance so my Vietnamese is essentially nonexistent. I believe my family is from southern Vietnam since I know there are dialects and stuff. Where should I start?

 What are best alternatives to Amazon in Vietnam? I&#x27;ve heard of Lazada and Shopee but not used either.
 I have a couple items I need such as a 3D printer and fish pond filter that are hard to find in shops
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I’m dating a Vietnamese girl and her grandfather just passed away. He has been ill for some time and doctors have even said he didn’t have much time, so it’s not really a surprise. Still, it’s obviously quite devastating to her and I’m trying to help her out somehow.
 I’m looking for ways to comfort and/or help her somehow. Maybe there’s something Vietnamese I can say. Any help would be appreciated.

 I’m looking for a new language to learn and it would be great to interact with them.
 Also, besides Vietnamese and English, is Chinese the next most spoken in Saigon? Or is there a different language I should learn instead of Mandarin/Cantonese?
 Thanks I’m advance!

                              <span>My (VN) wife and I (67yo American) will spend two days in Ha Giang soon. We want to rent a motorbike for two days to drive around, but not do the full loop. We live in Vietnam. I normally drive an electric motorbike and don&#x27;t have a motorbike license. I have a TRC. I&#x27;ve learned that one of the leading motorbike rental shops (QT Motorbikes) will rent a motorbike to me, but they require that I leave my passport with them. I don&#x27;t like doing that. (Also, I might need my passport at a hotel or if the police stop us.) I&#x27;m looking for recommendations for a motorbike rental in Ha Giang that will rent a semi-automatic bike to me for two days without requiring my passport as a deposit. Thanks
 Edit: Would welcome hotel recommendations in Ha Giang and places to see within a few hours&#x27; motorbike ride, too.

                              <span>Hey! I&#x27;m from England, I&#x27;m 19. 
 My university has offered a trip to Vietnam for a month because our university collaborates with a university (BUV) in Vietnam, Hanoi and I need to do some volunteering work and such.
 Expenses such as Flights and accommodation are covered which is nice and is why I took the offer. I have never been outside of Europe and have no real idea what to expect. 
 I&#x27;m eager to have this new experience and see a completely different culture and hopefully meet some nice people :)
 What should I expect? And any tips?
 Thank you :)

 Found this discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/xezgk1/whats_your_opinion_on_vietnams_education_system/

                              <span>My wife and I have tickets to be in Saigon from January 23 to February 1. Since that week is Tết, we heard it may be a bad time to go because a majority of the city will be closed due to the Holiday week ( similar to the US and Christmas Day).
 Does anyone know for sure what it’s like during the week of Tết? My wife and I were just hoping to enjoy some of the local scene such as (and especially) eating at all the street foods, local markets, some sight seeing, etc.
 Thank you!

 One of my favorite places for live music, a variety of food and beer was the Benthanh Street Food Market.
 What are similar venues to this that are still open?

Basically I know someone who is visiting and enjoys reading about the history, ideally I&#x27;d find a book they can read as they travel to give them context on each place they go to, especially about the wartime.

                              <span>Tried to find some data online and struggled to find what I was looking for. Perhaps because the resource may be in Vietnamese?
 I’m curious about the wealth distribution by age in Vietnam. Been in Vietnam for a few weeks now. I’ve noticed a lot of people in their late 20s/30s wear nicer/designer clothes and tend to have fancier bikes than those older than 40. Although, I also know people that are younger may tend to care about these visual indicators of wealth more.
 Vietnam is a rapidly modernizing country, so I’d assume people born in the late 80s/90s have had better career opportunity? Curious about people’s perspective here. Assuming that the fallouts of the wars with America and China took some time to economically recover from.

                              <span>First time I booked them. Actually booked AA but the carrier was JAL. I thought JAL had a decent reputation.
 Other than some super efficient and sweet stewardesses this was not a good experience. 
  
Tried to upgrade to an emergency aisle seat for 100$. At first the very nice Caucasian worker said ok. But after checking with the Japanese JAL rep they said no. Only Japanese citizens can book it. Huh????? Can you imagine if AA said only Americans can book certain seats?
 
Inflight entertainment really blew. The movie selection was like a scarce selection of movies one might find at a rummage sale. They did have one James Bond movie. I ended up watching that and Shawshank Redemption for the umpteenth time. The hardware interface had such lag you never knew if a button press actually worked. Had to restart a few times. I know it&#x27;s a lot to ask but nowadays a selection of podcasts is pretty common. Also, and this is in general, why can&#x27;t airlines offer live newsfeeds? JAL had a day old BBC International segment and one Japanese language news segment.
 
I sat economy. The seat was particularly torturous even for economy. It was hard and small. I spent the last 6 hours of the flight rotating my position trying to find new unused parts of my ass that would give me ten minutes of relief. I&#x27;m a medium size guy.
 
The food was typical airline food in this case limited to Japanese cuisine That was ok by me but I thought I&#x27;d mention it. I had two legs on this flight: BOS to NRT (14 hrs) and NRT to SGN,( 6 hrs).Both flights had the exact same menu. I just skipped meal service completely on the second flight. 
 
 Maybe my experience was a one-off. Anyone want to share?
 Thanks.

 I am learning Việt and I believe watching series (with subtitles for now) could help a lot. I would prefer Spy x Family as the first one but if there are other alternatives I would be fine with them too. Cảm ơn!

                              <span>My dad is in Vietnam. I want to buy him one of those nice massage chairs for Christmas. And I saw some of these online stores where you can buy stuff in Vietnam and they will ship it to the address.
 Site like: https://www.ubuy.vn/en/brand/massage-chair
 or Alibaba.com
 Does anyone have any experience buying Massage chairs from these sites?

                              <span>So I just had this sweet cake. I was told that it was Vietnamese, it was kinda sweet, not too sweet. I think it isn&#x27;t made out of rice, maybe beans. It has somethings on it that looked like hay. Can someone help me out? Tried to search for it but found article of kid choking on hay.

 Spoke to my bank and it would be at least a week to get a replacement ATM card. 
 My bank said that I could go to a bank in Vietnam and provide my account information and they would be able to withdraw cash from my account.
 Has anyone done this in HCMC and what banks would you recommend/avoid?

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 I am currently visiting Vietnam and really enjoy the country, culture and cuisine! Therefore I want to buy some nice chopsticks as a souvenir for home that reminds me of this country whenever I try to replicate one of the delicious dishes.
 But so far I could only find some on the night markets and they don&#x27;t look good or of good quality to be honest. I am looking for a nice design, wooden and local/handmade would be a nice addition. Currently I am in Hanoi and will be leaving soon. Googeling brought me to these of Hanoi Desing Center ( http://hanoidesigncentre.com/product/570-wooden-chopsticks-m17). But unfortunately the shop doesn&#x27;t seem to exist anymore, I checked the location and they don&#x27;t reply on Facebook.
 Do you know any stories where I can get something like this? I would really like to find some nice ones. Thank you!

                              <span>I know there are is inheritance law that theoretically allowes spouse certain rights. But does anyone know in practicality what happens to your property, home, car, ect, as a foreigner when a Vietnamese spouse dies.
 Ive occasionally heard different stories about the spouse inheriting or having to sell to get the value and even the local family being awarded the property. But I never heard in practicality what happens in this situation. 
 Or what is best to do before hand to simplify the inheritance procedure.

                              <span>Foreigner here. So someone in VN wants to transfer me some fund from their VN bank to my VN bank account. Does anyone knows if VN bank allows me to withdraw from VN dong and convert to U.S. dollars? Any paperwork I have to show such as where the source of the money?
 ​
 I will be bringing these U.S. dollars oversea by cash physically. I am aware we have to report more than 5000 dollars at the custom at VN airport. It will be more than 5000 dollars. I heard something about 30 percent tax on the amount carried that are declared?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m going to Vietnam for the first time next week and I&#x27;m wondering if anybody knows any specific places I can exchange USD for Dong in district 3? I&#x27;ve read that jewellery stores give you the best rate but does anybody have any specific spots in D3 so I don&#x27;t have to travel too far with my cash? 
 Also I plan on getting a VN sim, if I call around to some stores to ask what their exchange rate is would they understand English? I don&#x27;t know any Vietnamese outside of random food menu items lol

                              <span>So i&#x27;m moving to Vietnam in a couple weeks to teach English for the first time. I want to live in District 3 or Binh Tanh but the language centres I&#x27;ve been offered are all around a 20 minute drive from these places. So it looks like ima have to rent/buy a motorbike/scooter. I currently don&#x27;t have a license but I&#x27;ve read you can ride a 50cc scooter without one. How easy/doable would it be to rent a 50cc motorbike for a 40 minute round-trip each day?
 After I&#x27;ve settled in a little, I&#x27;ll probably work on getting a license.
 In the meantime, does anyone know of any other ways to get about the city that wouldn&#x27;t be as expensive as getting a taxi every day?
 Cheers

                              <span>I heard someone recommended Vietnam discovery esim. Is this a viable option compare to obtaining a sim at the airport?
 I’m spending 30 days in Vietnam and don’t really mind the cost as such but I want something that will work the entire duration, not something that will work 1 day and shit bricks the following. If you got a sim at the airport, which kiosk did you go to? 
 I went back in April and had no issues with grabbing a random kiosk seller sim but seem like a lot of people are reporting issues of reliable sim at the airport lately.

                              <span>Hey guys, so I’m visiting Ho Chi Minh for a couple of days this weekend as part of a longer Vietnam trip, thinking of checking out Saigon skate shop to get a board and was wondering if there are any skaters here who know a good place to skate near the centre? 
 I googled Ho Chi Minh skate park and there seems to be one but it’s pretty far away apparently! So just wondering if there’s any closer street spot that won’t bother people too much. Cheers!

                              <span>Hello, I’m an American on a business trip to Vietnam. Even though I have only been here for a week. I don’t want to leave. I feel a deep sense of peace here that I don’t feel in my country.
 I love American, don’t get me wrong. I feel as if people in Vietnam are more genuine and kind. I don’t think I’ve smiled as often at home. 
 I’m sure this is coming from a place of privilege. But I have a deep feeling of belonging here. I’m sure I will be back for business. But I wish I could stay.

                              <span>Just wanted another opinion on this as I want to be safe.
 Me and my partner are interested in doing the Ha Giang loop in a few days. My partner has been driving all over southeast Asia with me on the back for the past several months with no issues. However, we&#x27;ve only ever driven an automatic and we&#x27;re a bit nervous as I saw a couple posts on here that said a semi automatic or manual was needed to do the loop. We messaged the scooter rental we rented from before when we did the Hai Van pass to ask them about the loop and they told us it was safe to do the loop on a 125cc automatic scooter with two people on it. We wanted something a bit bigger if we could do it on an automatic but they don&#x27;t have anything over 125cc.
 Just wondering from people who have done it recently, especially with all the construction I&#x27;ve read about, if they felt that would be adequate. If not, maybe we might get a lesson on the semi automatic when we get to Ha Giang and see how comfortable we feel on it before deciding what to do? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>My wife is Vietnamese and lives in Da Nang. She wants a platform to sell her products and has been considering opening a market stall in Hoi An (night market). Does anyone know how difficult this is or if it’s even possible? I don’t think it’s as simple as turning up with a stall? I imagine if it’s “first come first served” the locals would not be very happy about you beating them to it. I would think there’s some regulation and rent to be paid though? 
 She is looking into it but was hoping someone here might know something about it!

                              <span>Can you think of a Vietnamese book so good, that it makes you glad you speak Vietnamese and are able to read it? 
 Can be popular or not, translated to other languages or not. 
 many thanks!

                              <span>Hi. First time going to Vietnam in a few days. I have heard people saying that a lot of beds in Vietnam are really hard, is this true? I have a pretty sensitive back so just wondering if the hotels&#x27; beds will be the same as beds in people&#x27;s houses? If so, is it likely that I can find hotels with softer beds for foreigners or be able to check what kind of beds each hotel has before I book?

 The Ha Giang Loop is an iconic ride through Northern Vietnam. Stunning mountain passes, delicious food, and chilly weather are certainly the highlights of the trip. 
 It&#x27;s absolutely on the tourist circuit, however. Be prepared to pass swarms of tourists, both domestic and foreign, on small scooters. Nearly every guest house in the towns you stop at will be full and, most likely, will have a party going on. 
 Overall, an excellent ride that I&#x27;d highly recommend.

                              <span>This is a long shot but…I remember hearing a Vietnamese version of the song by Andy Lau-Lian Xi (Practice). I believe it was two females and one male singing. Haven’t heard it in almost 20 years and wondering if anyone knows where I can find this? Song

                              <span>Not sure if this is the place for this. But I’m doing a solo trip to Vietnam for 3 weeks in December (9th to 29th). If anyone else is in a similar position and wants to meet up, let me know. I’m not a creep, just a normal woman in her early 30s, and thought it might be cool to meet some fellow redditors!

                              <span>I need some recommendations of fome coffee equipment. I currently own a Timemore C2 grinder, Aeropress go, Hario french press, some phin filter &amp; a cheap shopee scale (but the timer couldn&#x27;t work anymore). I am listing them so you can have a good gauge of my budget vs quality.
 I am thinking of getting a gooseneck kettle, a new scale &amp; V60. 
 1) Gooseneck Kettle: I am not sure if I should get a temp controlled one at this point. But I want a small one. Not those 1L and above. Looking at Hario or time more
 2) V60: Plastic, ceramic vs copper?
 3) Just get a cheap one from amazon? Is it worth to get so expensive. whats the diff?
 What brands and model should I be looking at?

                              <span>A female dress up as her friend&#x27;s dad and interrogate and slightly harass (a lot harass) the boyfriend (who has glasses). In the beginning, she was eating a sandwich. By the end, the mustache fell off her face, and funnily she takes the mustache and stick it between her brows like a unibrow and also onto his face. At one point, to show masculinity she pulls her pants up all gungho and declared &#x27;I AM MAN!&#x27; in English. The boyfriend was so nervous that he was trembling so much to the point that he shook off the couch and fell onto the floor. She was later revealed to be female.

                              <span>So I saw this (love) song maybe a few years back and can&#x27;t find it. The singer or the person it was focusing on is a female with red hair, actual blood-red or rose-red hair. The world is about to end with astroids or meteors hitting Earth. The female goes about her day while everything is in chaos around. At one point she was at the gas station getting gas and at a store getting groceries while everyone around her is panicking. By the end of the music video, she is eating a (romantic) dinner with someone (maybe not human) while a meteor is about to hit the earth.

                              <span>I’m a 25 year old male from Ireland. I’m looking at moving to VietNam, probably Ho Chi Minh city but I’m open to other options.
 One concern is dating, how does dating in VietNam differ to western societies?
 Is dating a foreigner seen as taboo or is it acceptable?
 Is there anything I should be conscious of?

 I have a 30-minute tech presentation which needs to be translated for 500 people in real-time. 
 You don&#x27;t have to know tech. The jargon will remain same in any language.

 Một người bạn cùng quê tôi tên là Ben đã qua đời vào sáng ngày 5/11 tại Quận 8, TP.HCM. Gia đình anh ấy đang vô cùng hoang mang và em gái anh ấy - Amanda đang cố hết sức để tìm ra sự thật anh ấy đã gặp phải chuyện gì. Tôi đăng bài này thay mặt cô ấy.
 Mọi người nói Ben đã rơi từ tầng 3 của một tòa nhà ở Quận 8 sau khi đi chơi đêm về nhà vào khoảng 5 giờ sáng. Chủ tòa nhà và công an khu vực vẫn chưa cung cấp thêm thông tin gì cho Amanda. Cô ấy thậm chí còn không có địa chỉ chính xác của toà nhà và căn hộ đó.
 Quê của Ben ở đảo Portland nằm ở phía Tây Nam Vư…</span>

Yesterday I was waiting for bus &quot;route 152&quot; at (Route 152 (backward) First Station Sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất .. Bến Thành — Khu dân cur Trung Son Pickup for every 12-18 minutes). I was waiting for over 1 hour and I see the bus &quot;152&quot; passed me 4 times and never stopped to pick me up. I&#x27;m confused how to use the app because I&#x27;m following the directions the app tells me. Should I walk to the other bus stop further down the road? Please help!
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all, I am American, learning Vietnamese for a couple months now. This weekend I was at a temple and as we were leaving I went to grab my shoes from the shelf but an older lady was in front so I said “xin lỗi bà...” She turned around and said some things I did not understand, but from her tone I’m pretty sure they weren’t very happy. 
 Did I insult her?? Is there something different I should have said?? Not sure if this is the right place for this question but everyone here is very nice so figured I’d give it a shot. 
 Cảm ơn các bạn!

                              <span>I’m going to Saigon for a short work trip soon and I was just wondering if mobile wallets such as Alipay, WeChat Pay, and GrabPay are now widely accepted in the city? What’s the most popular e-wallet in VN right now and can foreigners sign-up to avail the service? Planning to use a mobile wallet (either GrabPay or Alipay) mainly for paying goods in malls and restaurants just to get by for less than 3 days in the city and I feel like I don’t necessarily need to withdraw cold, hard cash in DONG since I’ll be staying in my hotel anyway working most of the time.

                              <span>Chào mọi người!! Recently on TikTok, you see a lot of people talk about their travels overseas and eating the same, if not more, but still losing weight. Or vice versa, with exchange/international students, moving to the States and gaining so much weight. I’m wondering if the same could be said about Vietnam about the food quality, I know there’s a lot of processed food in every country but Vietnam is high on the list of countries with the healthiest diets! Does anyone have similar experiences with weight fluctuations while traveling between Vietnam and the States? I’m moving there soon and I’m really curious!

 I have a query regarding a travel route from Ho Chi Minh City to Krong Siem Reap. My preference is towards traveling by road as I have been told it&#x27;s very economical compared to the flight. Along with that, I wish to know how comfortable that journey is and would you recommend it to someone who is traveling there for the first time.
 Looking forward for your helpful and insightful responses. I surely believe that I will have many more queries and I have utmost faith in the fact that most of them will be solved through this subreddit.

It would have been published sometime between May and August 1972 and features a Soldier standing on top of a tank on the cover. The magazine cover format is similar to this :https://nhacxua.vn/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chinh-luan.jpg 
 It features a family member of mine so I would happily pay a high price for a good quality scan of this cover or even more for the magazine itself or both. I&#x27;m not sure where to start, but wanted to reach out on Reddit in case anyone might know or even have this copy of the magazine. Thanks!

                              <span>I am active on a sub that avoid Chinese products. Often the alternatives are made in Vietnam which I am happy to support the local. However a few people say Vietnamese made products are no better, usually citing (without sources) that Vietnam uses low-wage workers as well.
 Now unfortunately I am quite unaware of the living condition of Vietnamese workers. Would you say Vietnamese workers are generally better? I know it&#x27;s not the best job but would you say it&#x27;s good enough? Sometimes there&#x27;s even absurd claim like slavery worker but I do not believe it happens in Vietnam (at least legally/endorsed). Would you say Vietnamese made products are more ethical? How would you respond to the above criticism?

                              <span>Hi friends,
 I&#x27;m planning a trip next year to Vietnam. I would love to do the entire country (North: ha Giang Loop, Sapa, Halong Bay, Hanoi,...) (Central: Hue, Hoi An, phone Nha ke Bang nationale park,...) (South: Ho Chi Minh) With all the different season I was wondering what is a good month/time to do them all? Ive read march/april is ok if doing them all. 
 What do you guys recommend?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all, my parents were born in Vietnam in the 1930s/40s and we came to the USA as refugees (my dad served in the south Vietnamese army). We&#x27;re all American (naturalized) citizens now and I don&#x27;t think we have our Vietnamese citizenships (my parents currently live in Vietnam and they had to get a visa to do so). I&#x27;m handling some (American) paperwork for my parents and unfortunately they&#x27;ve requested a copy of my parents&#x27; birth certificates which we don&#x27;t have. What would be the easiest way of getting this?
 From looking around online it sounds like my parents would have to get one from a Vietnamese embassy/consulate but it&#x27;s a weird situation because they&#x27;re not Vietnamese citizens anymore. My parents have US passports for reference.

I really found amazing how Hanoi has a lot of physical and consistent activities for the youngsters. It made me wish we have something as lively as this in my country. So yeah, I want to play basketball or tennis too! But I&#x27;m afraid if the tennants are allowed to use them too? Also, I&#x27;m still learning Vietnamese but still not ready for small talks, so yeah. But if there&#x27;s anyone I can meet and get to know, then also plays b…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Coming April I wanna take a motorbike and travel through Vietnam for about 3 weeks. I have my European motorcycle license, so I&#x27;m fairly confident on the bike.
 I&#x27;ve always wanted to do a tour between Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, mainly riding through the mainland. However, after doing some research I get a lot of sources saying the north of Hanoi is the place to be.
 On one hand I&#x27;d love to get as much a vibe of Vietnam as possible, which seems the Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi would provide best. On the other hands, if the best sites are in the north, then I can totally be convinced to go there.
 Is there anyone who could give me some advice on this?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi all, apologies for using English and the google translation below. 
 ​
 I LOVE FOOD!!! One of the most exciting parts of coming to Vietnam for me is learning about the culture and food that Vietnamese people are so beautifully famous for. 
 ​
 My problem(?) is that I have had gastric sleeve surgery so I can&#x27;t eat much. Generally in Australia, my husband and I order one meal to share, but if I want something he can&#x27;t eat or doesn&#x27;t like, I will order my own meal and take the leftovers home to reheat later. That&#x27;s going to be a little hard when I&#x27;m trying to eat as many different type of Vietnamese food as possible.
 ​
 Would it be offensive or &quot;bad&quot; for me to order a whole meal for myself and leave a lot of leftovers? I&#x27;d love for us to order 2 different Pho&#x27;s and get to experience both but would it be a bad thing if we didn&#x27;t eat it all? 
 Any tips on how to explain/apologise for my limited eating capacity will be well received!!!! PLEASE!

 TÔI YÊU THỰC PHẨM!!! Một trong những phần thú vị nhất khi đến Việt Nam đối với tôi là tìm hiểu về văn hóa và ẩm thực mà người Việt Nam vốn nổi tiếng xinh đẹp.
 ​
 Vấn đề của tôi (?) là tôi đã phẫu thuật dạ dày nên tôi không thể ăn nhiều. Thông thường ở Úc, vợ chồng tôi gọi một suất ăn để chia nhau, nhưng nếu tôi muốn món gì mà anh ấy không ăn được hoặc không thích, tôi sẽ gọi suất ăn của mình và mang phần thừa về nhà hâm nóng lại sau. Điều đó sẽ hơi khó khăn khi tôi cố gắng ăn càng nhiều loại thức ăn Việt Nam càng tốt.

 Gọi nguyên một suất ăn cho mình mà để lại nhiều thức ăn thừa thì có phản cảm hay “xấu” không? Tôi rất muốn chúng ta gọi 2 phở khác nhau và được trải nghiệm cả hai nhưng không ăn hết có phải là một điều tồi tệ không?
 Mọi lời khuyên về cách giải thích/xin lỗi về khả năng ăn uống hạn chế của tôi sẽ được đón nhận!!!! LÀM ƠN!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m currently travelling through SEA and running low on my Antidepressants.
 Now I wanted to ask if Sertralin is OTC in Vietnam so that I can get it in any pharmacy or if I need to see a doctor. I will be back in my Homecountry soon so I will only need a small package of the Pills.
 Glad if anyone has experience with the topic and can help me.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’ve been in Vietnam the past month (&amp; loved it btw, I fell in love after visiting Ninh Binh) - 2 weeks in Hanoi &amp; the last 2 in Da Nang. 
 Everywhere I go, people constantly stare at me &amp; when I do go into shops, I’ve been told I look Vietnamese. This happens when I speak english to them. I say thank you when I hear them, cause tbh Vietnamese women are beautiful &amp; also didn’t know what to say in response. 
 Honestly, I’m not sure if I’m thinking too much into it but just wanted to know what it means? 
 I’m not Vietnamese (obviously lolol), just a traveler from another SEA country.
 Edit to add: I’m a female &amp; motorcyclists stare at me while driving past. not sure if they’re just being creeps

                              <span>Arrived at SGN yesterday and went to the taxi rank. We&#x27;ve been following the advice of only using Mai Linh / Vinasun or just walking, but a man at the rank queue guided us to a Saigon Tourist taxi at the queue. I thought he was the official taxi rank guide, but looking back obviously he was a partner / part of this particular taxi company.
 Taxi driver was chatty and had fairly good English, asking us about our home country.
 First issue was the exit toll - didn&#x27;t realise there was one - he said we had to pay it, pointing to a sign on his sun visor. I asked how much and he wouldn&#x27;t properly say, then as I looked in my wallet he reached over and grabbed it, went through the notes saying there were lots of big ones, and pulled one out. I really thought it was a 100k bill (but can&#x27;t be sure) …</span>

                              <span>As per my username I want to cave dive, but I’m so far struggling to find an option to get trained and do this in Vietnam. My usual dive sites Phu Quoc and Nha Trang don’t seem to have any caves to the best of my knowledge and no dive shop I’ve checked offers either cavern or cave training. 
 Has anyone got any ideas? I’m kind of stumped and even when I’ve asked in Vietnamese language scuba groups nobody seems to know.

The metro has been delayed forever, not started on the new airport and recently the infamous Saigon One Tower that is incomplete stopped construction because one guy behind the management got arrested.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I plan to visit Vietnam, Da Nang around the end of January, 2023. I&#x27;m little bit concerned about Typhoons as in my home country we do not have anything relatively extreme. I read on news that Da Nang experienced Typhoon Noru - saw the videos, images and heard that there was an evacuation in thousands, so got scared a bit and thinking - maybe just go back to EU and sip beers there without worrying too much, haha. 
 I do plan to stay there for a month or two as DN. Anyone who have been there and can give any pro-tips about that place, please let me know down below. 
 Cheers

 What are some good spots or activities to meet other tourists/backpackers/expat/etc?
 I saw a pub crawl and a couch surfing event but they are both on Saturday and I can&#x27;t find anything on meetup.

                              <span>My partner and I (Europeans) are traveling through VN while working remote. We did some research and asked our friends about their experiences and recommendations on this country.
 One couple in particular was very enthousiast about Da Nang. Said they could live there. Also, we read Da Nang is #3 hot spots in SeA. Based on these findings and recommendations, we booked ourself a good amount of time here.
 After spending 5 days in HCMC - which we really enjoyed - the experiences here in Da Nang didn’t really meet our expectations. We’re staying in the beach area, went to the city center, did Hai Van Pass &amp; Ba Na Hills.
 We’re very curious about the history of this city. It feels like there’s put a lot of money into it years ago, but not very well maintained. Also they’re still building A LOT, while other properties seem unfinished.
 Is this city build to be Asias Dubai/Barcelona/Rio/Miami (since it has a beach)?
 We’re also looking for recommendations on what to do/see/eat here :)

 What does this mean and are there any colours not to wear?
 For example can my husband wear a smart business suit and double cuff shirt? What do I wear?
 Thank you

                              <span>Do you spray from front or back?
 Use the other hand to clean butthole as well or does the gun itself is sufficient? How do you know? 
 How do you dry yourself off? Toilet paper of course but what if there&#x27;s no TP? 
 Do you flush first then use gun or flush after?
 How do you deal with water splashes on toilet seat?
 Tricks/tips from your master of this subject is greatly appreciated!
 Edit: I&#x27;ve never use it before in the US and I&#x27;ve been here couple weeks. Sure it&#x27;s not rocket science to use it, just interest on how people optimize the use of it. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a preferred method for a guy vs girl. 
 For me as a guy,since my junk, I lean forward and spray from the back. I tried spray only and use TP to check, sometimes it&#x27;s clean and sometimes not. So I&#x27;ve use my left hand then with TP ready, wipe dry. This is where if you had a sink on top of the tank like some Japan toilet, you can wash your hands while sitting.

 Have been here a couple weeks and been eating local cuisine; it’s delicious but I find that it doesn’t really agree with me. I’ll spare the details but let’s just say I have an upset stomach.
 What do you make that’s similar to back home and where do you purchase it?
 I plan to continue eating local occasionally, but on a daily basis I need something similar to what we have back home.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone. I might be moving to Vietnam soon and was wondering how widely available linseed oil is. I use it a lot as a dietary supplement to help with my omega 3 to 6 ratios, and was wondering if it is easy to get there, and if anyone knew how much it cost. I would appreciate if anyone can help me with that info.

                              <span>I went to some random emperor tomb earlier today and found a few dragonfruits laying there, I was starving so I took one. I also oppened the biscuit pack and tried one, it was very good and now I want to buy it to eat the full pack (it tastes like the Scottish fudges). I had no money so I gave a prayer to the emperor. Is it considered as a blasphemy or is it okay for alive people to consume the gifts made for the dead? If not, what happens to the goods when the limit passes?

                              <span>So my father and I are currently in Vietnam on a UK passport. Prior to entering and during our trip I have read lots of different information regarding Visas and extensions, border runs etc. 
 Here is my experience.
 So before arrival I had purchased a 30 day e visa from the official government website and printed this out. (90 day visa are not available). 
 We flew from Bangkok to Hanoi. At the airport in Bangkok the check in desk didn&#x27;t ask to see proof of visa and I was told we would be permited 15 days as standard. Upon arrival into Hanoi immigration didn&#x27;t ask for my visa yet stamped our passports for 30 days. Maybe they could see on their system we had purchased an e visa?
 We rented motorbikes and during our 30 day road trip we attempted to cross the land border into Laos and Cambod…</span>

                              <span>Tình hình là mình mới transfer qua Úc được gần 6 tháng. Lúc đầu nhận phòng có 2 đứa người Úc, 1 đứa UK, 1 Kenya, 1 Mỹ, 1 Chinese. Sau một thời gian nói chuyện với tụi nó thì rút ra kết luận là kĩ năng nghe nói của mình quá kém T^T, nhất là khi nói chuyện với đứa UK và Úc. Không chỉ accent khác mà cách tụi nó đặt câu cũng khác quắc. Thí dụ khi gặp nhau UK hay hỏi &quot;Have you done much today?&quot; Lúc đầu mình nghe hổng ra cứ phải nghệt mặt ra hỏi lại, giờ nghe quen thì chỉ cần nó nói much là bắt bài được liền &#x3D;)) nhưng vẫn là nghe được 50% của nó thôi không nghe ra được hết. Mình để ý cách tụi nó đặt câu hỏi và trả lời, và với cách mình được học cũng khác nữa, nhiều khi mình hỏi mà tụi nó không hiểu, nên thành ra ông gà bà vịt :))) để luyện tập thêm thì bên cạnh nói nhiều với tụi nó thì mình cũng coi show, program và để ý các nhân vật đối thoại rồi nhại theo, chứ cũng không biết còn cách nào khác không. Đặc biệt là nhiều khi muốn join conversation của tụi nó mà ko được cứ thấy vấp váp kiểu gì. Nói được 1 2 câu là ngưng nhảy số rồi. Mình muốn hỏi các bạn đã luyện kĩ năng nghe nói như nào vậy? Mình có tìm hiểu thì biết phải luyện theo intonation, schwa, diction. Các bạn luyện theo những phương pháp này thấy ổn hông? speaking của mình lúc trước cũng ko tệ lắm, 7.0 nhưng thấy cũng còn loay hoay quá. Hoan nghênh mọi ý kiến đóng góp. Any advice would help! Thanks all.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m interested in getting a better understanding of Vietnamese humor. What are some of your favorite funny shows or movies in Vietnamese? Preferably ones with English subtitles (but I know that&#x27;s probably much rarer), as I am still learning Vietnamese and am not very good. The only movie on Netflix they had was Dreamy Eyes (Mất Biếc) which was a pretty good love story, but not a comedy.
 In no way am I making an assumption based on the tiny sample size of the shows available on Netflix, but is comedy less popular in Vietnam as a form of entertainment? I&#x27;ve also tried searching online other places besides Netflix and don&#x27;t find much stuff about Vietnamese comedy. So what are some of your favorites you could recommend?

 Also does anyone have any recommendations of where to watch the world cup in Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An, Da Lat and Ho Chi Minh? Thank you

                              <span>I really enjoyed my time in your country for 3weeks. See my previous post. I enjoyed your food a lot especially Coffee!! I want to be back to travel badly again.
 I bought 1.2kg of coffee beans to experiment egg coffee, coconut, ice coffee, salted coffee and all kinds. 
 Any tips for this?? And is there a difference between aluminum and stainless steel phin? I bought the cheap 20-40,000 VND aluminum ones from the robusta coffee beans shop and it really doesn’t fit well. Hence, once I reach home, I bought the stainless steel one for about 80,000 VND and shipped it to my country.
 I was in a cafe and heard a song I really like but couldn’t capture the song name in time. When I reached home, I randomly searched for top Vietnam song and found “Sai gon Dau long qua”.
 What does it mean?

 I&#x27;ve been looking for a pair of eyeglass frames that were discontinued in the US, and for some reason, they&#x27;re readily available in Vietnam. I&#x27;d like to order them from one of the websites where I found them, but I need a parcel forwarding service with shopping assistance. Does such a thing exist in Vietnam?

                              <span>I’m (27m American ) going to Da Nang in 4 days it wasn’t initially on my radar but now I’m going to visit a friend (35f VNese ) what would be some nice activities for us to do? We are both kind of home bodies and like the cafe scene. I like book stores as well but just wanting to expand the horizon of what we do maybe something outdoors or historical. Advise is appreciated thank you in advance.

                              <span>I went on a trip to Da Nang and saw a lot of workers grinding concrete and working with dust using no dust mask or respirator. At first I though, well maybe people can&#x27;t afford the respiratory, but a dust mask would still be useful for concrete dust and affordable. One could even wash and reuse them.
 Concrete dust is a pretty hazardous material to breath in. Perhaps there is less education on that? As I didn&#x27;t actually know myself the first time I used it.
 Then of course the traffic is pretty aggressive and I understand the collision rate is rather high.
 So it just seems like safety isn&#x27;t a top concern. Which is a shame because life is precious, IMO.

                              <span>So, I’ve been living in Vietnam for almost 9 months. I’ve been to all of the major spots, HCMC, Hanoi, Dalat, Da Nang, Ninh Binh, Tam Ky, Hue, Nha Trang. I’m not into touristy destinations. Solo traveler, looking for hidden gems of Vietnam. I recently went to Con Dao and loved it. Looking for something lesser known and off the beaten path. Not looking for a party atmosphere. Any recommendations off the beaten path? Cheap is good too. The least westerners the better. No offense.

                              <span>From Timo website:&quot;From 5th July 2019, foreign nationals are no longer eligible for Goal Save Accounts as stated in Circular no. 48/2018/TT-NHNN. For Term Deposit Accounts, foreigners with a valid document proving residential status in Vietnam with at least 6 months validity will be eligible to open Term Deposit Accounts with a Term NOT greater than the remaining of its validity. Existing Term Deposits opened before 5th July 2019 will be continued until its maturity.&quot;
 ​
 I tried opening an VN checking account at Timo hangout on person,but was told I needed 12 months visa. I tried opening SHB bank saving account but was told that saving is only for VN citizen. Can anyone explains or make clear if it is possible for forienger who have 5 year visa exemption to have a saving account that earn interest?

                              <span>Hey guys!
 I am currently studying International Business in Asia course at Homeschool Rotterdam and I have a current project in which I need to determine consumer profiles in the Vietnamese fruit market. Thus, I am required to investigate this matter through field research.
 However, I don&#x27;t know anyone in Vietnam and was wondering if you could help me fill out a survey that I need to have filled in by at least 100 Vietnamese people.
 The survey consists of 30 questions and it should not take longer than 10 minutes to complete. All data received will be used for study purposes only and will be kept strictly confidential. Furthermore, you will remain anonymous without having to enlist your name, email address, or other personal information.
 Would it be okay to post the link here on reddit, or would I get flagged for potential scam / fraud?

Such as, people go out in the wood and making stuffs with very primitive skillset. And then because the initial videos were so successful, a bunch of fake videos prop up.

                              <span>Hi. Just returned from Vietnam. My itinerary was roughly 4 days in tp HCM, 10 days up North in various places, then another 7 days back in HCM.
 I found that Hanoi was really active. Full of tourists, full of fun things happening. And most importantly, hotel accommodation was reasonably priced. Managed to get a good sized room with a balcony, at a good hotel, for around 650.000 in Hoàn Kiếm area, not five minutes walk from the lake. 
 By comparison, on my second stay in Saigon, best I could get was a passable room in a really cramped hotel with paper thin walls, for about 1000.000/n. I did scour Agoda and Booking.com for better deals, but there weren&#x27;t many to be found. 
 And this despite there being very few tourists there (for some reason). That being the case, you&#x27;d think supply would exceed demand, and you&#x27;d get hotels dropping their prices in order to compete. 
 Another example: In my first 4 day stint in Saigon, I got a nice room with a balcony, in a nice but slightly run down hotel on Để Thám, for around 835.000. I would have booked them for my second stay too, but for some reason, they decided to double the price after I left. 
 I&#x27;m not whining. Just really puzzled by the economics of this.

 If anyone has done this loop, please share where you slept throughout it as i’m still wondering where to choose
 Thanks!

                              <span>Do you know anyone or has personal experience with anyone who illegally emigrated to another country in the last 15 - 20 years? No, I am not talking about people who fled as refugees. I am talking about people who intentionally overstay (permanently) their (tourist or student) visa in a foreign country.
 I have a relative who is considering this and work as a nail technician (in my opinion very bad route) and I would like to hear real stories or experience of people who have done it before.
 My main concerns and what I have told my relative are:
  
It&#x27;s illegal and you are breaking the law (duh)
 You will have to pay a huge up front fee for this illegal service ($100k USD).
 You won&#x27;t be able to work legally. Working illegally means terrible working condition and pay. It might take 7 - 10 years just to repay the fee + interests.
 You won&#x27;t have life in these 7 - 10 years since you are trying to save every penny.
 You won&#x27;t be able to return to Vietnam any time soon since you don&#x27;t have legal documents.
  
Also, what is the best way to report this illegal activity to the authority (Vietnam or foreign country) without implicating my relative (financially or criminally)?

                              <span>Hi Folks
 I have spent around 30 mins searching the sub however what i have found it is pre-covid therefore out of date.
 I am looking for a Vietnam Solidarity Tours- aka supporting the Vietnamese people based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty - pro socialism / Communism - and no outside interference from other nations or religions.
 The tour focus in Hanoi and on the Vietnamese war from their side - not the outside world or USA and if possible to meet and show solidarity for the Vietnamese Society/people.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m planning on crossing over to see the Pathet Lao caves in Vieng Xai in Laos from Hanoi and was wondering if anyone has suggestions on the best way to do this. 
 Best I&#x27;ve seen so far on the internet is taking a minibus from Thanh Hoa to Sam Neua which is near Vieng Xai but curious if anyone has either 1) a better suggestion of getting near there from Hanoi directly since otherwise I would not visit Thanh Hoa or 2) something a bit more comfortable, since the bus from Thanh Hoa seems to be a cramped minivan with passengers shoved in with all sorts of produce/local goods and overall an uncomfortable ride compared to the great coach busses in Vietnam. Thank you!

                              <span>In short, I just came back from my 20days Vietnam and bought back 300gx4 coffee beans from different shops.
 I refused to buy phin from those streets stall fearing they might not be authentic. So, I purchased 2 phin from 2 different shops that I bought beans from. Both same size, Aluminum , but cost 40,000 &amp; 20,000 VND. But both brands are trungyen. I am okay cause both are super cheap hence I. Didn’t think. Much. 
 When I reach home, I couldn’t fit the filter press into the chamber covering the grounds properly and found out that the ones I bought are too cheap to be authentic.
 I just wanna ask the Vietnamese here which are the actual? Is there an actual one? Is it made of stainless steel? Or there is nothing wrong with my aluminum cheap phin and it’s meant to be like that and all I have to do is to just sand paper it down ?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am visiting Hanoi and was curious about a few things. I wondered if I could ask .. (apologies if any of these questions seem ignorant, I do not mean them to be).
  
I see there are people, usually men in different uniforms .. there are the green which is military I think, but also yellow and then a darker green which seems to be older men? What are the different uniforms?
 
Are the water puppets perceived as very touristy, or is it something Vietnamese people see / enjoy also? Is it a true tradition? The crowd was almost entirely Western so I wasn&#x27;t sure.
 
When police drive through the streets saying things on the loudspeaker, what are they saying? People seem to move their mopeds but I wasn&#x27;t sure.
 
Is there any significance to the sunflower seeds people eat, or is it just a nice snack at the bar / restaurant?
 
How are tourists perceived in Hanoi? Do people (generally) have any anti-American or anti-Western sentiment? If so, is it generational?
 
What are the attitudes of young Vietnamese people to the military? I know there is conscription but also it is relatively easy to get out of (?). Is military service considered a good or useful thing generally?
 
Are the schools inside the city e.g. Old or French Quarter for rich people or are they local schools for everyone in the area?
 
What might locals think about visitors&#x27; attempts to cross the road? Are tourists a nuisance on the streets?
 
 Apologies if any weird questions, just things I was curious about wandering around.

                              <span>From the time of 1990s to 2000s, I have heard a lot about stories of young students who studied hard to earn the title Trạng Nguyên in the old days of Ancient Vietnam.
 This title have made it way to exert a strong influence in Vietnamese schools from when I was young, where talented kids in our classes will be refered as Trạng Nguyên nhí (little Trạng Nguyên, which reflects their talent at a young age) . 
 Though people no longer have these tests to make people becoming Trạng Nguyên anymore, I still really like how prestigious the title is, as it proves your talent and achievement as a scholar. It also brings a sense of nostalgia about the traditional culture of Vietnam as well.
 What are your opinions about the Trạng Nguyên culture of ancient Vietnam? Feel free to let me know in both English or Vietnamese!

                              <span>So it seems a lot of parents in Vietnam sleep in the same room or bed as their children, even into teenage and adulthood. This is a foreign concept to me and I&#x27;m wondering how people keep their sex life alive? Is it a lot of ninja sex while the child is asleep? Have lots of people caught their parents having sex?

                              <span>Me and my partner are traveling through Vietnam rn and went to the War Remnants Museum this week. I learned about Agent Orange and it has been worried me sick since then. I just can’t shake off the feeling that I’m being exposed to the dioxin. Even though it’s 50yrs ago, it’s not like dioxin has an expiration date.
 If it’s still in the soil, how does it NOT affect the (tap) water, fruits, plants and animals? For example: if tap water comes from rain, the rain first goes through the infected soil and is pretty much untreated (doesn’t really smell like chlorine). People here also say it’s safe to drink boiled tap water and I guess they make pho’s and coffee with it. But how about heavy metals like lead?
 We’re flying to Danang today and just the feeling of walking around that airport where that stuff was at 50yrs ago stresses me out.
 Am I overthinking it or is my stress legit?
 I feel so bad for the locals that this happened.

Experiencing culture (special events, traditions, temples, local food)
 Pretty nature (beaches, mountains, forests)
 Fun/interesting experiences (for example animal parks, outdoor spas, museums, diving, walking/exploring, cooking class, kayaking, cultural festivals, night markets)
 Food (especially Asian and seafood)
 Chilling
 &quot;Special&quot; charming places that aren&#x27;t completely overtaken by tourists
  
(Extra info if relevant: We will fly from Frankfurt Germany. Budget-wise we imagine spending about 3k Eur every month including food, but that&#x27;s really flexible. We&#x27;ll be taking 1 week&#x27;s holiday each month and WFH for the rest of the time wherever we are, but only for 5-6 hours a day.)
 I also want to ask: Does it make the most sense to fly in and out of Thailand?
 Thanks a lot in advance.

 Nice to meet you here. I just got my visa approved by the government and I would fly to Vietnam next week. Does anyone know if I can withdraw money from the ATM with my revolut card? I would really appreciate a honest answer. Thank you!

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m of Vietnamese descent. My family does not really talk about or embrace that culture and a lot of them are actually very racist against Asians. Is there any way I can get more in touch with my culture in subtle ways so they don&#x27;t get upset? Or are there any places i can look to find cultural advice? 
 Cảm ơn tất cả! _^

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been asked where I&#x27;m from by Vietnamese people and when I say I&#x27;m English I&#x27;ve had at least 5 people (men and women) respond with lovely jubbly! How do they know about this relatively niche and somewhat uncommon British phrase? My guess is that the TV show &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; was aired in Vietnam in the past, the phrase is used on that show.
 Help me solve this perplexing occurrence, thank you

                              <span>We applied for E-Visa on the 10.11.2022 at 9:35 in the morning and had a flight from Bali to Vietnam Ho Chi Min City on Monday 14.11.2022. We arrived at 18:30 and our E-Visa was still in Process. We had to enter using our German Passport which granted us a stay for 14 Days. We now have to leave vietnam on the 28.11.2022.
 We already have a flight from hanoi to chiang Mai on the 05.12.2022, so we would overstay for 7 Days. 
 Now we dont know what to do. Should we do a visa run? Should we try to extend our visa? -&gt; we already went to a Immigration office in which they told us we cant extend our visa so we have to pay a fine at the airport for our overstay in Hanoi on the 05.12.2022. Or should we just book a new flight out of vietnam before the 28.11… 
 I hope you guys can help us out.
 Cheers :)

                              <span>Hey all,
 For my visit to Vietnam, I am looking for beachfront resorts (or homes if resorts are not available) in places close to cities with airports (apart from Da Nang). The dates are between 26th November and 6th December. Budget can be up to 75 USD (or 1850000 VND) per night but the lower, the better. Quiet, serene places with good food options are preferred.
 I checked AirBnBs, booking.com, other such sites and didn&#x27;t find many options. If any of you know have stayed at places like this or know of them, please drop a comment here. Would appreciate it a lot :)
 Thanks

                              <span>My girlfriend and I are coming to Vietnam in 2 weeks, we are playing with the idea of buying a cheap motorcycle and traveling up through Cambodia, across Thailand and down to Phuket. I have done this before in India, but never south east Asia. Can anyone foresee any potential obstacles we may face doing this? 
 Thanks,

                              <span>I have been in Vietnam for business all week. I am enjoying the country very much but have not really done much besides work related events. This coming Friday is my only day to get out and experience some touristy things in the city before I leave. I enjoy historical sites, architecture, botanical gardens, et cetera. Not interested in partying. If you had one day to explore, where would you go? Any input is greatly appreciated!

I have some ideas on what to visit but I have not planned anything in details, the only thing that I know is that I would like to explore nice hiking places and do outdoor activities. I should spend some time both in South Vietnam and the north. 
 Is it easy to find decent outdoor clothes? Here in Europe, there are shops like Decathlon that sell decent clothes at a decent price for outdoor activities. What are the similar shops in HCMC? Does it make sense to buy the clothes that I need there rather than bring a lot of clothes with me?

                              <span>On some of the website it says, it&#x27;s on 7th of December and other sites says it&#x27;s on the 8th of December? So it&#x27;s kind of confusing. I will be leaving on the 8th of December so I hope I can still experience this festival!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I just joined this subreddit to ask a question I&#x27;ve been thinking about. I work in a bar, and a few gentlemen from Vietnam came to visit my city for business. All of them ordered coffe and sat down. Each and every one dipped their cigarettes into the coffe before smoking it, the filter I mean. So my question is, is this a cultural thing in Vietnam? I tried asking them but we couldn&#x27;t understand each other well. Do any of you know the answer to this?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am an American man planning to move to Vietnam to teach English. I&#x27;m almost finished with my TEFL course and plan to visit Vietnam soon after. I&#x27;m so excited and have so many questions, but first, I want to ask about this topic which I have seen come up quite often when doing my research about Vietnam.
 Somebody posted an article here a few days ago about culture shocks when traveling to Vietnam, and one of the first things on the list mentioned that it&#x27;s common to see men publicly physically assault their wives.
 I have been doing a lot of research about Vietnam, and while I love almost every other aspect about it, this topic has arisen so many times that I feel the need to ask you people who live there and have been there before. So many articles mention that you will see men hit their wives and as long as you don&#x27;t interfere, you will be fine, etc. This really concerns me because of some instances of seeing this in my childhood that really bothered me, so I am really worried about seeing this in Vietnam.
 How common is it really? I plan to travel to the major cities like Hanoi and HCMC. Is it actually a super common thing to hear and see domestic violence? It really makes me anxious thinking about having to see and hear this and not be able to help. 
 I guess I get triggered when I hear or see domestic violence and am wondering if it&#x27;s something that I am likely to be forced to witness on a regular basis in Vietnam.

                              <span>Hi all. I’m an American living in Vietnam and I need to open a bank account at a new bank because my international banking with my U.S. credit union is a nightmare. Looking for recommendations on for an international bank that makes international wire transfers from Vietnam easy, has relatively low fees, and can be set up abroad.

 Does anyone know how to get 1 year visa and the cost in Vietnam? What about the temporary residence permit , where do I apply and the fees associated with it?
 Note: Not planning to work in VN yet. Any suggestions would be appreciated 👍

                              <span>This is the first time we have encountered a situation like this in our lives. So far, there has been no precedent for intentionally deceptive mishaps in the Vietnamese banking system, and the notion that &quot;the bank is the safest place&quot; has become inherently ingrained in the minds of ordinary citizens. Because of that belief, we are now in danger of losing all of our assets, which we have worked for years to acquire. Furthermore, by posting too few warning signs and withholding information about these bonds, people like us were unaware of things that should have been legally displayed to us.

                              <span>Nguyễn Thị Thanh Nhã, hay còn gọi là Céline Nhã Nguyễn, đã trở thành người phụ nữ Việt Nam đầu tiên chinh phục đỉnh Everest.
 Vào tháng 1 năm nay, cô đã chinh phục thành công khối núi Vinson, đứng ở độ cao 4.892 mét, là đỉnh núi cao nhất ở Nam Cực. Thật khó khăn cho cô khi vừa leo dốc trong thời tiết khắc nghiệt vừa mang theo một gói 70 lít.
 Nhã và nhóm leo núi của cô ấy quay trở lại Everest Base Camp ngay khi lên đến đỉnh.
 Theo danh sách mới nhất của The Himalayan Database, tính đến tháng 12/2021, mới chỉ có 3 người đàn ông Việt Nam chinh phục đỉnh Everest thành công.

                              <span>I hold a passport from a country that has a Visa exemption for a set amount of days. I&#x27;m wondering what other requirements I need to get for a trip to Vietnam. Any COVID requirements as of Nov 2023? How about health insurance and travel insurance? And is it true I need to book through a travel agency to get &quot;invited&quot;? I saw a YT video that said I would need to...which would suck since I already booked a ticket and BNB.
 Will be flying in May 2023 and staying in Hanoi :&gt;

                              <span>After doing northern vietnam i’m looking to go down all the way to the south, and i’m wondering how to travel between these places. 
 From Ninh Binh to Hue by car is 11 hours, so i’m guessing maybe taking a plane would be best, or sleeper bus. There probably isn’t an airport in Ninh Binh so I might have to go back to Hanoi if flying is the best option.
 Hue to Nha Trang is also 11 hours by car, so maybe plane or sleeper bus again. I was considering doing the Hi Van Pass maybe from hue to Da Nang, if it would be easier to get from Da Nang to Nha Trang.
 Nha Trang to Phan Thiet by car is 4 hours, so idk about that one.
 HCMC to Phan Thiet is also 4 hours.
 If anyone has done a similar route before, please share how you traveled between these places and any other tips
 Also, if you have any other recommendations for places near the ones I have mentioned, or if you recommend skipping a city feel free to share:)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! I remember having this lime iced tea everywhere in Vietnam we went to eat. It was very floral, citrusy and refreshing. I want to try to make it at home but can&#x27;t find a decent recipe online. I bought the ingredients in the pics plus lotus and jasmine tea in Vietnam to try to make it at home. Any recipes you can share?

                              <span>I’m traveling to Northern Vietnam and touring Hanoi, Hoi An, Monkey/Marble Mountain and Halong Bay. Locals, what are some book recommendations that I need to read before I go? I’m not looking for a travel book. Anything that is historical and gives me a good sense of the complex history. Historical fiction and/or or nonfiction. Thanks!

                              <span>I inquired with a tattoo parlor (IG saigonink_studio) through FB and got quoted $1100 USD for this piece. Is this the normal price for a piece like this in Saigon? If not, what are the usual prices for something like this? Thanks!

                              <span>I have been here three times now, and Vietnam always holds an incredibly special place in my heart. The food, the art, the culture, and the seemingly endless ebb and flow of motorbikes in and around the major cities. What always sticks out the most is the absolute tenacity of Vietnams people. They are &quot;get it done&quot; type people, which I have the utmost respect for. Vietnam has some of the most stunning landscapes you can witness from the northern Ha Giang mountains to southern mighty Mekong. Partnered by ever changing food dishes curated by the different distinct cultures. This place is somewhere I long to call home one day. Thank you for everything, and until next time.

                              <span>Hello there. As a young Vietnamese, I generally just don&#x27;t care about what language they&#x27;re singing. I believe that artists should convey their music in any way in which they feel the most comfortable. But the idea of having Vietnamese artists that mostly sing in English or have an English stage name is so frowned upon in Vietnam and many would be called &quot;sính ngoại&quot; or &quot;anglocentric&quot;. I&#x27;m curious and would love to hear more about your opinions on this topic.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to cycle around, starting in Hanoi and looping around the north back to Hanoi. What are the cons of this besides the obvious ones like getting caught in the rain? 
 I&#x27;ll be staying two months so I think it&#x27;s doable but I&#x27;m not sure of the terrain and things.

 Thanks for any information!

 I was suppose to do a 21days trip but decided to cut short to 19days because I was really tired traveling. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my post covid trip.
 • 5days in DN/Hoi an. • Hai van pass to Hue. I love it. • 1.5days hue. • 2.5days Ninh Binh &amp; I love it. • 2days Hanoi. Crowded and busy but pho was great. • 3days Sapa. Hike up Fansipan was the best choice. Family dinner was simply great • 2D1N Ha Giang Loop was the best. • 2days back to Hanoi to rest. (Could have done Cat Ba island, or hai phong, or squeeze in Phong Nha, but right now, I am so really tired. I need to go home right now))))
 Thank u still guys :)))

                              <span>Hey all, I’m planning on visiting South East Asia for a couple of months in Feb/Mar as I’m taking a sabbatical from work. Vietnam is top of my list. I’m looking for a real escape with some chilled time to heal physically, mentally and spiritually. I’ve had a tough few years for various reasons, one of them being my health. I have a problem digesting food due to an issue with my pancreas. Thus I need to eat mainly low fat, healthy food.
 Here comes my questions:- 1. Vietnamese food seems super healthy, and especially so in North Vietnam, where I read the diet is more simple. Would you agree? Cooking with too much oil is a killer for me, deep fried is a definite no and I generally avoid red meat.
  
I will have to bring medication with me (enzymes) as I need these when I eat. Has anyone been able to bring a prescription from abroad and use it in Vietnam? I live in Netherlands, Europe btw. I’d like to be organized with this in case I want to stay on longer. I have 6 months off from January.
 
I’d like to do some kind of agri tourism while there, perhaps where food is grown and to be a part of this. I’d love to learn more about growing grains and plants, and it would be nice to involve with a community.
 
Staying fit is super important to me, so I’d love to join a gym over there for a month, is this easy? My gut is telling me Hanoi is a good place for me to be for a while. Also I love to bike, is it common to cycle around Vietnam?
 
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>Hi, I was wondering what were the current traffic stop bribe rates for say:
  
Driving a motorbike without a license
 Breaking simple traffic rules (crossing a solid line etc)
 Running a red light
  
I&#x27;m guessing it would probably run from 200K for 2, 400K for 3 and maybe 1 million for 1, would that be about correct?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Can foreigners with small/moderate amount of fund buy VN index fund? If so, which brokerage has the lowest fees and which index fund has the lowest expense ratio?
 On related note, is it wise to put fund into cds or savings to get interest?
 Are stocks gain or interest gained from cds/savings taxed?

 My child has a diagnosis in two different countries and a prescription written here in Việt Nam for a non-amphetamine (concerta) medication. I&#x27;ve called numerous pharmacies and hospitals in Da Nang and HCMC but have had no luck so far.

                              <span>I am always fascinated about South East Asian countries specially Vietnam. I would like to visit Your country in coming 6 months. I would like to know as much as possible about Vietnam through books, movies, blogs, vlogs, documentaries etc... I would like like to learn how local people love there, how is their daily life, what are their challenges, what their comfort food. Which songs make them dance when they listen to it. What are their offbeat destinations which no youtuber shows. What do young Vietnamese people think about their countries growth, economy &amp; job opportunities... I hope you get my point what I am trying to learn. Please suggest me anything that you would like to share. Also, if anyone is interested to talk/chat become online friends then, it would be great as well. Thanks.

                              <span>Hello! Two Americans here - first trip to Vietnam in February for two weeks!
 We’ve been on other trips to SE Asia - Thailand 2X, Malaysia, Singapore.
 We’ll spend 4 nights in Hanoi, 3 nights in Cam Ranh, and 5 nights in HCMC (last night is to depart, so really 4). 
 My question is - what is something that could be surprising or different from other places in Asia we’ve been? Any general tips specific to Vietnam? 
 If you have any Old Quarter Hanoi or District 1 HCMC street food we should get - would love to hear that too! 
 SO excited to finally be able to do this trip - we put it on hold for a long time with the pandemic!

                              <span>First time traveling to Vietnam! I am going to meet a girl I&#x27;ve been talking to for 3 years now. I do alot of gardening and canning/preserving and would like to bring some home canned goods to give to her family. 
 I was wondering if I can put several mason jars wrapped in bubble wrap in my checked luggage. The jars are 2 sizes, 1 qt and 1 pint. The contents of the jars are; pepper relish, pear relish, jelly, hot sauce, salsa, tomato sauce, BBQ sauce, pickles. 
 I found this site, but it&#x27;s really confusing and I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s where i need to be looking because it&#x27;s a US document.

                              <span>Does anyone have any recommendations for a service (iOS app) that allows you to subscribe to a Vietnamese number that can send and receive SMS? I am not a fan of the SIM swapping as it&#x27;s disruptive to 99% of what I need to do when here (work).
 In prior countries, I&#x27;ve used Burner, Hushed, or Flyp as phone services that allow me to subscribe monthly (or annually) to have a dedicated local number. I can send and receive SMS messages with locals through the app.
 When I connect with people here and give out my number (American) if they&#x27;re iOS it is fine since we can iMessage. But most are not iOS therefore they are hesitant to text (or some can&#x27;t) because of the international number.
 I know there are alternative apps like WhatsApp and such. I use Signal only, as I don&#x27;t like WhatsApp, however some of the people I connect with aren&#x27;t going to do Signal (not tech savvy, not interested in it, etc..).
 I&#x27;m fine paying for the service. Our VOIP provider for work doesn&#x27;t offer any Vietnamese VOIP numbers, just a company assigned SIM, so I was hoping to find an alternative. I welcome any input.

 But if I enter the details of my booking I get the message &quot;Sorry, we are only able to support Thai currency booking at the moment.&quot;
 What does that even mean and how can I access my booking?
 Interesting observation: If I replace the last letter of my reservation number with something else the site responds with &quot;There is no flight information match, please re-check input value&quot;
 That means with the correct number they found my booking. 
 Any ideas?
 Thanks

I walked up to the ticket booth at the entrance to the gardens, and upon seeing me, a man in line, maybe 50 or 60 years old, grabbed me by the side and pointed to his friend (around the same age) to take a photo. This isn&#x27;t uncommon while traveling, many people ask for photos because I&#x27;m a foreigner with bright blonde hair. I posed smiling in the photo as his friend snapped the pic, and then his friend wanted one too, so I took a selfie with him. Besides these two men, maybe 3-4 women around the same age were with them. As his friend moved back into the group, the first man hugged me from behind, pulling me in close to his body, and tried to force h…</span>

He was fined and lost his job IIRC, but I haven&#x27;t heard anything since then. Is he still in the country?

                              <span>I can only seem to find outdated posts on what people prefer. My partner and I are visiting Vietnam and staying in one place for a month (Slow traveling, need a mini-vacation from switching up places so often). We&#x27;re not super crazy about the idea of being in a city and want to stay on the outskirts (near a beach would be ideal) of a city. We are deciding between Hanoi and Hoi An and would love some advice on things like cost, food (we&#x27;re vegetarian), and overall advice. 
 Since it&#x27;s a month, we want to be near a city/civilization. If you have any other beautiful natural places that are relaxation friendly in Vietnam, I&#x27;d be more than happy to hear ideas! We also will be there for December and would love a swim hole if the waves are too choppy in the ocean.

                              <span>Hello - I&#x27;m planning a 13 day trip to Vietnam in December. I have the first and end part of the trip more or less as I&#x27;d like, but struggling to decide on the in between bit.
 Questions:
  
Are we allowing enough time in each of the locations?
 Is 4-5 days in Hoi / Hue too much? I&#x27;m conscious of the weather at this time of year, and the fact it&#x27;s Christmas. We ideally don&#x27;t want to be flying on 24th or 25th Dec and would like to stay in a nice place on those days.
 What are the obvious things we&#x27;ve missed off?

                              <span>Hi all, does anyone have any recommendations for how I should go about trekking to the summit of Fancipan in Sapa with a guide? 
 I would like to do the hike over 2 days, camping half way and reaching the summit early in the morning the second day. I can see there are a lot of companies offering the tour but I’m not sure how to pick one. I would strongly prefer to use a tour company which is local to the region / pays local guides fairly.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m looking for some advice regarding my 27 day trip to Vietnam in January. 
 I am thinking of doing the day 3 loop of Ha Giang in the first week of January at the beginning of my trip, but I&#x27;ve also heard it can be very cold and possibly snowing, as well as foggy. Would it still be worth it to make the trip during this time, or should I skip it?
 What kind of clothes should I bring if I do decide to make the trip? I want to make the most out of my trip while enjoying it, and as it would be one of my first stops on my trip, it could set the tone of the rest of my trip. 
 ​
 Really looking forward to this trip! Also, would love to hear any other off the beaten path suggestions of where to visit.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a month since i started studying business at a small vocational college (but i think i will switch to a safer option: logistics since i realized a 3 year business program is pretty shallow and too general plus im not very talented to surpass the average ). Well the experience isnt so great because of the age gap and the irritation caused by knuckleheads who are in here just to avoid military duty .But at least i stopped feeling lifeless like before somehow. Ive just got myself some small targets and plans, hooray. Btw im seeing someone from the school recently, isnt that sweet for a miserable peasant

                              <span>Looking for something that my dad and I (while in Vietnam) drive mainly, but ideally my mom (50s) can too. She already has an electric bike and doesn&#x27;t really use it much. The scooter cant be too heavy and should have decent storage. Something that looks like a vespa is what I have in mind, but I&#x27;m open to anything, both electric and gas recommendation. Much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi! I have been to Vietnam 5 times now but have yet to do the Ha Giang loop. I&#x27;d like to leave the USA in february to dodge part of the winter and go back to Viet to ride the loop. I remember that Hanoi was quite cold and rainy when I was there in January and I&#x27;d prefer to ride the loop when weather conditions are optimal. Is February too early to ride Ha Giang Loop? I can wait until early march if I must but going early february is preferred if conditions are similar. I am getting conflicting information as a I read articles about it. 
 Btw I am experienced with riding a motorbike in viet countryside and am aware of issues with trucks and busses. Im guessing that I wont have problems with riding Ha Giang. I was thinking of a Honda Wave semi-Auto. It was reliable last time I did a trip around Vietnam and Im not practiced on manuals. Like many others, I am not going to be riding this legally. Im aware of the risks but just like last time I went to Vietnam, I gotta do what I gotta do.

                              <span>For transferring fund from monthly investment from VN bank to outside VN, what is the best bank for non VN citizens?
 So far I know Citibank VN allows transfer. But there is a high fee of 165,000 vnd monthly if we don&#x27;t maintain 100 million vnd balance. Not sure if we can buy cds or saving to maintain this balance. Any other advice would greatly be appreciated.

In Korea they have https://motorstudio.hyundai.com/itg/ln/main.do?lang&#x3D;en You can go look at cars and even just book cars in advance to test drive without any sales intention at all. I have done this a lot in Korea
 Can I do this if I visit Vietnam?

                              <span>I’m flying from Seoul to Hanoi on Friday at 6:25am. The trip was extremely spontaneous as I booked my ticket on Sunday evening, and I applied for my visa Monday morning. It says it takes 3 days to process and tomorrow morning will mark day 2. Im concerned I won’t have it before my flight in a couple days, does anyone know a way to get an expedited Visa? Any advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello all, would be visiting during Dec when World Cup is ongoing. Are there any popular or great bars to catch football there? Any places that&#x27;s popular with the locals is even better, would love to experience Hanoi&#x27;s ambience!

                              <span>Hi guys, my girlfriend and I are spending the next 4 months in Vietnam. We fly into HCM and plan on travelling the Deep South - Mekong Delta onto Phu Quoc.
 We have estimated on spending 20-30 days in this region and are wondering if this may be too long? We are also considering exploring the delta on motorbikes (is this worth while for the time spent there?).If so would anyone have experience or routes biking the delta/south. We mainly found 1/2 day trips online about the delta, and haven’t found much on longer self planned stays.
 As far the places entail (suggestions welcome!)
  
My Tho
 
Ben Tre
 
Tra Vinh
 
Vinh Long
 
Can Tho
 
Sa Dec
 
Cao Lanh
 
Long Xuyen
 
Chau Doc
 
Ha Tien
 
Phu Quoc
 
 Any advice would be hugely appreciated :)

                              <span>Here are some situation in which I regularly come across.
 I am in the lift, it arrives at my floor, the doors open, and people rush in before I could get out.
 Go for health check. Come early to avoid the crowd. The doors open, again everyone just rushes in and put their paper first. Then others come lift the pile of papers and put their under I hope that the person working there will flip the pile.
 Someone on a motorbike arrive at an intersection, wants to turn left,but there is traffic so can&#x27;t turn directly,so just start driving on the incoming traffic until they can final cross. Instead of waiting at the intersection.
 It is lunch time,some parents come to pick up their children, there aren&#x27;t many people, just 2 or 3 bikes. And still, they find the way to park right in front of the gate.

 The plan for a HSR line running across the country was authorized in 2021. Originally planned to be a 350kph/220mph-ish line, the 2022 version calls for a designed speed of 250kph/155mph and an operating speed of 180-225kph, or 111-140mph. The construction will take place from 2025 to 2041 in three phases, a nine-year reduction compared to the original plan. It will utilize electric multiple units as the rolling stock, with both passenger and freight versions running on double-track standard gauge (1435mm) rail, as opposed to the existing narrow gauge (1067mm). 
 The line will be 1508km/937mi long, consisting of ~70 stations. The annual estimated figures for passenger and freight is 163M and 65M metric tons, respectively, with 142 pairs of passenger and 128 pairs of freight train running daily. The first phase (2025-2031) will comprise of a 361km/224mi line connecting Thu Thiem (HCM City) to Nha Trang. Following this, a line from Hanoi to Da Nang will be constructed from 2031 to 2038. The final phase (2038-2041) will involve connecting Nha Trang and Da Nang. Roughly $61.7B will be spent, with the majority (63%) coming from land acquisitions and auctions. 22% will come from state-funded sources, with private funding expected to be about 15% of the total budget.

                              <span>Does anyone knows how much it cost to see the original document of a last will for a property in district 1 of Saigon? How much does it cost to get a copy of it? As a foreigner, is there someone who will service in English or is it Vietnamese only? I am pretty new to this and any advice is appreciated.

                              <span>Can someone explain to me as a foreigner the fake European towns that seem to be popping up around Vietnam. 
 It’s super impressive the sheer scale of these places however I’m struggling to see how they will be filled with shops, hotels and tourists?
 Who is the target market here?
 For example the Sun Group’s primavera village in Phu Quoc is id say 80% complete, what will the plans be? For tourists to live and stay in the town?
 Super intrigued by it all!

                              <span>So long story short I am a doctor at an internal ward in hospital (not an English speaking country). I have a Vietnamese patient that has a rather complicated, newly diagnosed disease. She understands basic things but I&#x27;d like her to have a better understanding of what are we treating here and what are the implications and perspective. I could use a google translator but given the circumstances I don&#x27;t want anything to be misinterpreted or lost in translation. Could anyone please help me with the translation? There are some medicine related words in the text but I tried to keep it understandable for the patient. I will PM you the text if you&#x27;re up for it. Thanks !
 EDIT: Thanks to u/huongv , I have the translation. Perfect !

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve tried looking for past post about good massage parlors and they seem to be outdated (~3 years ago)
 Since Vietnam is slowly reopening due to COVID, I&#x27;m wondering if there are any good massages around Hanoi. Especially near the Old Quarter and Ho Tay. For both locals and tourist (specially those that can speak English)
 My wife was raised and born in Hanoi for 20+ years and haven&#x27;t been back for 10 years. We don&#x27;t mind going to a massage parlor that only speaks Vietnamese since she can translate and my Vietnamese is at an elementary level for an American.

                              <span>Hi, I am travelling to Phu Quoc, Hanoi and Da nang/ Hoi An next week. All sorted on the places to go and things to do, but I really wanted suggestions about the food to eat and the places to eat it from 
 I know this is very wide and vague, but I want to try all the local dishes and really sample as much of the Vietnamese cuisine as I can because I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll come back to this beautiful country. 
 Any suggestions about the joints/ restaurants to check out would be appreciated, along with the regional dishes to try. I understand a lot of Vietnamese food is street food so if you guys even recommend the streets/ markets to go to in these cities to sample the local fare, would love that. 
 Specially looking to try as much coffee, noodles, rolls as I can!

 My bank&#x27;s fees are ridiculously high with 3% plus the base service fee of almost a million.
 Does anybody have any idea how to move money into Vietnam without giving parts of it to the financial leeches in the process?
 I&#x27;ve heard that gold sellers are offering good rates but I were wondering about their actual capacity limits.
 Could anyone share their expertise and experiences with me on the subject?

                              <span>Hello All
 I am new to reddit. I am a student studying illegal drug use globally. I am doing a side project focusing on Vietnam specifically, and noticed that there has been a lot of prescription medicines being seized by Vietnamese police. Why is this happening. I never remember this being an issue 3-4 years ago.

                              <span>Hi guys, I am currently travelling through Vietnam. 2 days ago while on Cat Ba island as I was biking, a dog came up to me and seemed friendly. He played around for a bit and ‘teethed’ (place his teeth on but not bite) my hand. He also lightly scratched me (left a mark for 5 minutes before disappearing). Does anyone know if there is rabies on Cat Ba Island? And also does anyone know if the situation I described is enough to transmit rabies? I’m currently heading to Ha Giang so will be away from any vaccination clinic. But it is now a massive worry, as I thought Rabies is evident with aggressive or erratic behaviour.

                              <span>Hi, As posted earlier in this sub, I am planning to visit Vietnam for a work related trip from the 16th of November. 
 But prior to that, I have been asked to prepare an assignment on Agriculture-based industries in Vietnam. I have gone through a few articles and videos on the internet, but it would have been really great if I could receive some insights and sources from locals there. 
 Thanks in advance.

 I had a long discussion about usage of &quot;em&quot; with a Vnmese girl and I felt that there seems to be some inconsistencies between what she said and what I had learnt so far.
 Perhaps there are some nuances of the Vnmese language / grammar that I am missing, so I just want to check with Vietnamese speakers here... cam on rat nhieu
 For context, I&#x27;m the older guy here.
 For so many months, I have addressed the girl as,
 - Hey/morning/goodnight em
 - em ngu ngon / em ngu ngon nha
 - Her name + em
 And there were no complaints from her. Sometimes it even seemed that she liked it.
 Then suddenly a couple days ago, she asked me not to call her &quot;em&quot;, as she feels that it&#x27;s impolite.
 She explained that addressing Vnmese people is a complex matter and that I have been using it the wrong way …</span>

 The page is in Vietnamese, so I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s where they ship.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Recently visited Phu Quoc and my mates and I came about a metre from stepping on a snake.
 It was a very thin little guy, with a bright yellow head and a grey-green body. I can&#x27;t for the life of me find anything about them on the internet, but wanted to check and see if any locals knew what they were called?
 Has anyone seen these dudes around?

 After several years of living abroad and not dialoguing in Vietnamese, I&#x27;ve been looking to buy an authentic Vietnamese dictionary that is used and sold in Vietnam to refresh my language. What is the best way for me to find a store that ship to America in Vietnam? I&#x27;m open to paying someone with relatives living in Vietnam who could buy and ship the dictionary. I appreciate any suggestion and advice. Thank you in advance.
 Cordially,

 I&#x27;m visiting Vietnam and I will be there in the last week of November and the first week of December this year. I have heard about floods during the month of November but would they happen in December too? What are the chances? And which areas might be affected if there are floods in December (first week)?
 I have two options. 1. Visit Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue from 28th November to 2nd December OR 2. Visit Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue from 2nd December to 6th December
 Which would you suggest? 
 Appreciate your help a lot.
 Thanks a ton :)

 I&#x27;m traveling today to Phu Quock. I&#x27;ll be there for 4 or 5 days to chill but I want to spend some time to travel around island and see some stuff. Do you have any recommendations what I should see, where to go for food and best way to travel around island. Where is nice beach?
 Is motorbike best way to do it? And if so good place to rent a bike. Open to any ideas
 Cheers!

So I thought I&#x27;d fly my small dog with me in cargo, he&#x27;s a really easy going dog. I read the requirements, vaccines and health certificate, anything else? Has anyone done this that can share the experience? Is it easy to do or is it a hassle?

                              <span>I speculated an alternate lore (short) where North Vietnam instantly invaded (or special military campaign&quot; in Laos to weaken the Western-dominated &quot;American&quot; alliance influence in Southeast Asia. Had Pathet Laos toppled the corrupted Vientiane government either in 1963 or 1964, then South Vietnam faced a peril where the newly communist Laos government planned to infiltrate Central Vietnam (South Vietnam) to prevent largely American forces gained on foothold across Central Highlands.
 Another POD is both Vietnams divided at the 16th Parallel (leaving Da Nang and southern branch of Thu Bon River under North Vietnam side). It would create massive chaos in Laos where communist North Vietnam easily determined to aid Pathet Laos to &quot;liberate&quot; Vientiane around early 1964 or 1965 (or even before 1968 Tet Offensive) depending on American military moodiness. North Vietnamese General Giap would like to see the size of NVA forces to orchestrate the moderately launched assaults of several Laotian towns and villages near the Vietnam-Laos border.
 With Laos under a &quot;socialist&quot; Vietnamese client state (regardless if Vietnam divided in 17th Parallel as per OTL or alternatively divided at 16th parallel), South Vietnam could faced intensified harassment from largely local &quot;VC&quot; communist forces near the South Vietnam-Laos border and even near provincial capitals in Central Highlands. This would lead the American government to seek peace talks with North Vietnam and Soviet Union secretly in a third country. If successful peace talks in mid-1960s, American could be saved up to 30,000 American soldiers and even save largely funds to fight against poverty in the domestic U.S. I generalized a possibly no Nixon as President of U.S in 1969.
 Can you think about ideas that devastated South Vietnam?

                              <span>Hello, I will visit Vietnam for two weeks. I don&#x27;t have a fixed itinerary but I&#x27;ll start from HCMC and finish in Hanoi. I plan to stay mostly in hotels as I would like to have a nice relaxing holiday.
 In my previous trips, I have mostly stayed in hostels so it was easy to meet people. 
 As a solo traveler, where are good place to meet people? Both in big cities and smaller places, but especially in HCMC as this will be my first stop

                              <span>We have most of our Vietnam itinerary booked except the Northern Vietnam section. We will be flying up from Danang (staying in Hoi An for 4 nights). We have done HaLong Bay already so this time we are thinking about Lan Ha Bay. I think it makes sense to fly into Cat Bai Airport (HPH) and do a 3 day night night cruise. And then bus back to Hanoi. 
 Should we stay in Haiphong for a night before cruise?
 There are so many cruise options, does anyone have a preferred option? We are obviously going for the honeymoon vibe. 
 Some options we are seeing for cruise include:
 Ylang by Heritage Cruise Line
 Perla Dawn Sails
 V’Spirit Premier Cruise

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking into a day trip to the delta and tunnels and seeing some serious hit-and-miss reviews. Most negative reviews are stating that it&#x27;s basically a shake-down where you&#x27;re expected to buy things and tip everyone at every stop. It&#x27;s an 11 hour trip and I&#x27;m on the fence as that&#x27;s a full day I could spend exploring Saigon.

                              <span>Hello friends,
 I will shortly be traveling to VN for the first time. I read a lot about taxis scamming you with prices. Also when renting bikes / scooters there are people with vests charging fake fees when in fact a free parking spot is just down the road. I read to just ignore them but I‘m easily „intimidated“ as I don‘t want to get in trouble especially in a foreign country plus I’m traveling with children. How do I best deal with these situations?

                              <span>Heading to Hoi An tomorrow for 3 nights and would be interested in getting a tailored suit. How exactly does it work and can it be shipped internationally as I am backpacking around SE Asia and wouldn&#x27;t have space for a suit.
 Any recommendations for a tailor that could get me a good suit for between 200-300 euro (or is this an unrealistic price range?) My girlfriend would be looking at getting a dress aswell but wouldn&#x27;t be dropping as much money on that.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right group for it, but I am going to give it a shot anyway. My girlfriend and I are going to thailand in November/December. We start in Bangkok, and will later on move up to Chiang Mai. In between, however, we will do a 4 day city trip to Hanoi. We are not looking for anything in particular, but would like to know if there are any (boutique) hotels in Hanoi that you really recommend / stand out. Our budget is around 1.700.000 VND. We are open for anything. Thanks all!

                              <span>So I got my passport stolen, so I got a exit stamp on my emergency passport which only permits me to go home.
 However, I’ve now got a new passport sent from home with no stamps on it.
 Do you think I should get an exit stamp put on my new passport. Or I’ll be okay just to enter Cambodia showing my emergency passport with an exit stamp and my new passport with no stamps?.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently on a Viet trip and was wanting to go to ba be. I can&#x27;t find anything about it on Reddit and the tour guide I&#x27;ve booked a couple things through said it&#x27;s a little crappy in terms of its tours and whatnot. Im still interested - honestly the lack of info piques my interest just having been to the insanely crowded halong bay. 
 Anybody been and have recommendations? I&#x27;m solo travelling and all the bookings through the ba be website require you to book for 2+ and are quite expensive.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an American living in Saigon (for over 3 years now) and my wife is Vietnamese, born and raised in central VN.
 Lately we talked about moving out of Vietnam to somewhere more permanent. I love Southeast Asia and want to stay, but Saigon has ridiculous real estate pricing and interest rates on house loans. Also, crazy pricing for international schools, crazy traffic etc. So I&#x27;ve done some research and see many foreigners who moved to Malaysia and they seem to really love it. KL/Penang seem very developed with good public transportation, great real estate pricing even for luxury places, good mortgage rates, good tax situation for digital nomads, and international schools are cheap. Overall it seems like a clear upgrade over many aspects of Saigon (don&#x27;t hate me for saying this, I honestly don&#x27;t know, just read online).
 For some reason though my wife is not down with this idea. She doesn&#x27;t like Malaysia and the culture there. I&#x27;m wondering what other Vietnamese people think of Malaysia and Malaysian culture? If you ever visited or lived there, what did you find hard to adjust to? What did you like or not like? 
 I&#x27;d love to hear your opinions!

                              <span>In the current debate surrounding Affirmative Action, many people evoke &quot;the poor Vietnamese who are uneducated and therefore need affirmative action&quot;. First off, most schools don&#x27;t consider the difference between South East Asians and East Asians. Secondly, statistics paint a different picture. Look at this table from Pew Research:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/pik9p1w0h0y91.png?width&#x3D;1694&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;87eee2b83401f3d4349b212c79251d00db52dc14
 As you can see, Vietnamese born abroad, that is, the refugees, have low educational attainment. But for the generation that was born here, educational attainment is higher than whites. This, of course, contradicts the liberal narrative that Asians are doing better because of higher socio-economic status. Yes, they are correct -- many Vietnamese came to the US poor and without much education. But their children perform better than white Americans.
 The same story is told with income:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/pocewmi4h0y91.png?width&#x3D;1646&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;4830d089be09f22dccae7fe3c065106b16ddc751
 So, pro-affirmative action advocates, stop using the Vietnamese as your token Asian minority to disguise your Asian racism. If you dig into the data, you might not like what you see.

                              <span>Because to the southwest they have hooker bars with &quot;bar fines&quot; in Cambodia, while in Vientiane, Laos, there are a hyperabundance of Vietnamese girls rocking the massage plus plus venues (because it&#x27;s apparently illegal for mixed race sexual relationships). Surely there are low-key strip clubs/girly-bars available under the radar, but why is Vietnam so conservative in this domain? Also, plenty of clubs in Mongolia (UB) and even majority-muslim Indonesia. 
 After living here for almost 4 years it&#x27;s a little disappointing to not have ready access to a girly-bar, but I of course don&#x27;t know why. What do you think Reddit?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been reading about different tribes around the world. Long ago (10-15 years?) I came across something online that said Vietnam has 52 tribes, and that most are in north Vietnam. That seems like A LOT for such a small place. I can google and find stuff on my own but I&#x27;m asking just in case someone might know some great material that I can read. It can be in Vietnamese. I can use Google Translate to translate the text. Thank you!
 I love this food YT channel based in Vietnam for going to visit the tribes around the world. This one is in Vietnam but I didn&#x27;t catch which tribe it is. https://youtu.be/81aLMRK1ris
 These are all the tribes around the world that they visited. Reminded me of Anthony Bourdain who visited unknown places. https://www.youtube.com/c/BestEverFoodReviewShow/search?query&#x3D;tribe

 Have been hired by a company and will have to do a visa run in the next couple of weeks. The problem is I’m running low on funds and kind of need to be paid before doing visa run etc.
 Is it possible? Or do I have to wait until I obtain work permit?

                              <span>Hello, I little background about me: I’m half Vietnamese and half white with family back in Vietnam. I’m visiting for the first time in nearly five years next year and I want to work on my Vietnamese. I learned a small amount from my mom growing up (she worked long hours and did not have much free time) but I otherwise grew up isolated from other Vietnamese people. I’ve tried a few app/services and I’m currently using Duolingo. I am aware, however, of how specific the Hue dialect is, and I’m worried that I’m learning bad habits and potentially making myself even more unintelligible to my relatives. Does anyone know of any services that specifically teach the Hue dialect? Or any tips for someone using Duolingo (which I believe is the northern dialect) and trying to apply what they’d learn to the Hue dialect? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Last week while I was travelling through Vietnam, I was going to fly from Hanoi to Hue and had a flight at 8PM. However, Vietjet decided to change my flight for 10AM of the same day. First of all, I had never seen any airline bring forward a flight before. Secondly, they refused to refund me the entire amount, and the only solution offered was a &quot;creditshell&quot;, which is a credit I can use for future flights with them. Now that I&#x27;m back from vacations and can afford to lose some time with this, I wanted to ask if anyone had any success obtaining a full refund from them for a similar situation, or if this is a lost cause and I should just forget about the 70$ I paid. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>This post is quite targeted but I will write it in English anyway. As a French student in Hanoi for 6 months to study or more, with eventually an paid/unpaid internship, what type of health insurance should it take? I heard about CFE, but do I need another insurance (or mutuelle) on top of that? What health care tips have you? For example, my welcoming school asks me for a proof of total cover for covid-19 treatment.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t get enough of the stuff (the vietnamese beef jerky), is there a magical place somewhere in this country that is the Bò Khô capitol? 
 Or any good places to buy it between Da Nang and Hanoi? At the markets i usually find very sugary beef jerky, and in the supermarkets its crazy expensive (and i would much rather support a family!). Any place where i can &quot;buy it at the source&quot;? In Da Nang right now if that helps.

I received am email that I need to pay for tax and fee (approx. 1.9m vnd) because they were &quot;gifts&quot; from outside Vietnam. I keep on responding to their email clarifying that it&#x27;s only shirts and a comforter and not gifts. 
 Has this happened to anyone before? How was it? What did you do?

 Ngày trước khi còn dùng gói cước HD70 thì nhà mạng bảo do tốc độ 3G yếu nên không hòa mạng không được. Sau đó nhân viên đề nghị tôi và gia đình sử dụng gói 120k tháng. Hứa hẹn 4G / ngày gọi điện nội mạng miễn phí. Đăng ký 6 tháng

 Thì ok tôi đăng ký được vì đối với tôi việc quan trọng là hòa mạng tốt.

 Nhưng Không Ngờ. Tôi đã bị gắng theo một bản hợp đồng trói buộc thiếu tính minh bạch!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m planning a trip to Hoi An soon and I&#x27;d love to know the answers to these questions:
  
Do the markets accept cashless/card payments?
 What do they sell at the markets besides souvenirs like bags and things?
 Are there any tourist apps/technologies that help you get around and give you information on the city?
 How&#x27;s the wifi access when touring around?
 Is the area mostly full of tourists, especially in the markets? Or do locals also frequent those?
  
(Reposting this because I accidentally confused Hoi An with Hanoi)
 Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>Hi my parents want to watch this years World Cup but they want it aired by the Vietnamese channels of VTV so they can understand better (they don’t speak English). Does anyone know where I can buy the service or how is it done? I can’t read in Vietnamese so it’s hard to navigate the site. TIA

                              <span>Hey, me and 4 of my friends are visiting Vietnam soon and are planning to travel from north to south over the course of 2 weeks. We have planned some of the trip, but we’re not sure if we want to go to Nha Trang or Phan Thiet/Mui Ne. We want to stay 3-4 days in one of those areas.
 Any thoughts?? Pros/Cons as to where to go? The trip is in the beginning of december, and temperature will be considered aswell.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey Vietnam, an outsider here. As leaders of both China and Vietnam met recently and in the west the general opinion on the ccp government is pretty bad, now I know that Vietnam has worked to have good relations with both the us and china but It got me thinking what the average Vietnamese here think about China and the ccp?
 Idk if these kinds of posts are allowed but I guess you can remove it if it breaks any rules.
 Thanks
