 Curious if any NBA fan out there knows a good spot/sports bar to catch some games? I&#x27;ll be in Saigon for a few weeks in Feb/Mar next year. Most games should be around 7/8am in Vietnam so I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;s too early for a lot of these places. TYIA

 Do you know of any service who would offer a tour as pillion rider/easy rider to do the Hai Van Pass as a round trip starting from da nang to hue and back. 
 Is it possible to do such route in 1 day?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be going on the Ha Giang Loop in December! Although I have not planned which agency or hostel I will be doing it with, I will definitely do it when I visit Vietnam in December!
 My question is, as amazing as it looks. There is one death road which does get me quite nervous. Its usually on day 2/3 which is just a narrow road with no gate and your basically at a cliff edge.
 My question is, are there any hostels which allow you to walk up this specific route? It&#x27;s only a couple hundred meters but instead of being on a easy rider I would rather have much peace of mind walking up the route.
 Please let me know and any recommendations you may have! Thanks!

                              <span>So I have been extremely lucky to become friends with a Vietnamese guy I work with. He has my wife and I over for food and karaoke multiple times a year with his whole family. We want to return the favor and have them over our house for dinner. I’m looking for suggestions on what American dishes I should make and which dishes I should stay away from? I’ve thought about trying my hand at some Vietnamese dishes but don’t want to insult them by possibly not making them right or whatever. I was thinking possibly going seafood route? Maybe some kind of seafood boil? Grilled fish? Maybe a pasta with clams? Or possibly smoking some beef ribs? I appreciate any input and suggestions. Thanks.

                              <span>Im traveling to Vietnam next month with my pregnant wife and daughter of 1 y.o. We&#x27;ll be staying in Saigon for 9 days and Phu Quoc for 3 days. Today we got our travel consult and vaccinations for our trip and the doctor said that they do not recommend traveling there in first trimester of her pregnancy, mainly because of the risks regarding the Zika virus. Does anyone know if Zika is still active in Vietnam and if so how many cases are there? And how worried/careful should we be? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>So this is something I’ve wanted to ask for a while. I am from Nepal but grew up in the US. Nepal had a lesser known People’s Revolution in 90s and 2010s. Currently I believe there are 3 major parties; “Maobadi” (far left, militant), Communist Party of Nepal (left), and Congress (center left). However I think a lot of younger Nepali people are starting to lose faith in leftist ideology. I am 24 now, and I feel like more and more I am shifting more towards the left politically, socially, and morally. But since you’ve guys had one of the largest revolutionary movements in history. What do YOU guys feel about it, is what I want to know. To be honest I don’t even know much about the politics of Vietnam and it’s society. So any input is valuable. Hope the mods allow this post.

                              <span>Hi. Viet Kieu looking to get a Vietnamese citizenship, lawyer quoted $7500 USD for doing the paperwork. Is that a rip offf? Does anyone know of any other lawyers in Saigon that can do it for cheaper? Asking for a friend.
 I have heard of other Viet Kieus paying agency to get their citizenship (passport, then CMND) ranging from $300 to $3000 USD.
 Edit: Some people are saying it&#x27;s EASIER to do it while in Canada but why is it? Seems counter-intuitive, wouldn&#x27;t it take longer because they want to see physical papers and that has to be sent from across the pond or no?

                              <span>So for the context, there are too many cases involving food safety and the last case of food poisoning sent more than a hundred people into hospital. I remember the case of pate Minh Chay that caused death was also overlooked and they only fined $755. Why so many cases of food poisoning and they keep doing it? If this is not addressed probably, food poisoning will continue to rise even worse like the Banh Mi Phuong case. What do you think about this?

                              <span>Hello, travelled to Vietnam 5-6 years ago (still my favorite destination ever) and eat Bahn mì multiple times a day! They almost always had an option to add a sort of cream cheese, but i have never seen it since in any Bahn mì outside Vietnam and i cant rly find it when searching for it. Is it a common ingredient and what kind is it exactly ? i suspect that its not traditional, but it was an option and so gooood!

                              <span>Hey everyone, this November, my girlfriend and I are traveling to Vietnam, and we hope to get some travel tips from you for our destinations there. So, if you&#x27;ve been to these places before, please let us know what you liked and didn&#x27;t liked.
 First, we plan to spend a few days in Hanoi and then visit HaLong Bay from there. After that, we&#x27;ll head to SaPa for 1-3 days. Then, we intend to continue our journey to Hoi An and wrap up our trip in Ho-Chi-Minh City. In total, we plan to spend 18 days in Vietnam. Should we change our destinations? Is there anything important we&#x27;re missing? We appreciate every single response!
 Best regards! 🙋‍♂️

                              <span>For a tropical country with quite a few uses for coconut, the coconut palm/fruit makes surprisingly few appearances in folklore that I am aware of. Sọ Dừa is the only well-known story (to my knowledge) where there is a strongish allusion to coconuts. 
 Are there any origin stories for the coconut in Vietnamese folklore? I know that for example, many Polynesian cultures have stories about a giant eel who is beheaded and the first coconut palm grows from its head, explaining why coconuts look sort of like a face when you dehusk them.
 Or other folktales where coconuts/coconut palms play a significant role.
 Also, I&#x27;ve heard that coconuts with flesh/water that didn&#x27;t develop properly are said to have been &quot;eaten by the moon &quot;(bị trăng ăn). I can&#x27;t find any allusions to any other crops being eaten by the moon. Is there any specific mythology about why the moon eats coconuts?

                              <span>I’m not joking. Serious question: do you guys give 70-90% of your income to your wife on monthly basis?
 I lived in Korea and Japan for 6 years and get married with a Korean woman speaking Vietnamese excellently. I often have conversations with Japanese and Korean male co workers and business partners. I swear they rarely do this. 
 Since my wife and I settled down in Hanoi, she has hung out and done yoga with some Vietnamese women in the neighborhood. Then, she went home and dropped hints by telling stories like:
 “Our neighbor A’s husband sends her 90% of his monthly income, so she can manage finance of the family for him, buy what they need and do saving. He only keeps 15 mil for his personal use.”
 I know she will never directly ask me to do that. My wife is typical modern independent Korean woman having good income as professional Vietnamese-Korean translator. I keep my own money and she keeps her own money. We have a common bank account to which both of us send money for family expenses. My annual income &#x3D; 5x her income, so I contribute much more. She is the person who came up with this idea, I totally agreed. She bought 70% of stuffs in our house.
 Yesterday, I saw a video on TikTok. That guy says his salary is automatically sent to his wife bank account by his company, and his wife would give enough amount of money for his living. I viewed the comments to his video, and it seems many people do this. I guess they were joking (not sure), but his video really raised my curiosity to ask this question. I am asking the same question on a Facebook group. Let’s see how many of us actually do this hehe. 
 We are young family (30 husband and 28 wife). We may have the first kid next year, so a solid financial plan is a must.

                              <span>I can’t seem to find a “one way” cruise. 
 Also please critique my plan for cat ba plan. Open to suggestions
 My current plan is:
 November 5 Leave Hanoi for Cat Ba -Take Bus(cat ba express) to Cat Ba, speed boat included 7:45 to 11:30 $14 USD -Check in Hotel -Trung Trang Caves -Hospital Cave? -Hang out around Cat Ba -Rent bikes, scooters to explore island -This seems to be an activity driven island, biking, climbing, etc.
 November 6 Cat Ba
 Serenity Premium Cruise -It&#x27;s more of LAN Ha Bay on the East Side of Cat Ba but they say it&#x27;s more green and less crowded/polluted -This will depart from Cat Ba around 7:30 AM -Ends around 3:15 -$35 USD! -https://halongserenitycruises.com/ details/
 Hang out in Cat Ba for the night
 Latest flight from Haiphong to Da Nang is at 5:55pm. I don&#x27;t think we can get to Haiphong in time to catch that so we have to stay the night.

                              <span>We are looking for something that is all inclusive and offers relaxation. We have never expierenced a vacation together yet. Its been a lot of loss the past few years. From me losing my taste buds from covid after being a chef for 30 years has been hard and harder recently losing my father. (at first i was like maybe this is too much to share then i realize besides my wife i have zero family) im retired who is going to judge. We have been married 8 years. She is my everything, she has had a very hard upbringing through foster care and so much worse. I want to show her what its like to have something specifically made for her and have her pampered like she should of been when she was growing up. So if there is any hidden gems of people to see, places to stay, or heck even realitors to talk to... even sites to go to or person to person talk ideas..... Sincerely, Hoping this helps.....

The base of this soup is some sort of slime, also wondering what that is? It consists of shredded chicken, mushrooms, two quali eggs(?), mushrooms and this slime(?).

                              <span>Price wise Vietjet and AirAsia are comparable whereas Vietnam airline is more expensive.
 I hear vietjet is stingy with AC and prone to long delays. AirAsia flights times aren’t as desirable and they fly into DMK airport instead of BKK (not sure if that’s good or bad). I hear Vietnam airlines is regarded highly but their flights cost more. 
 I’m happy to pay a bit more for a better experience but the flight duration is 2 hours at max so not sure if it makes much difference? 
 Anyone have any strong opinions to share about any of those three airlines?

(The minimum requirement is 6 months.) She hasn’t entered Vietnam yet. Is there a way she can enter where this won’t be an issue? Maybe by bus? Or is there another way to fix this problem?

 Does anyone in the group, particularly experienced ESL teachers, have experience in getting an original textbook/curriculum licensed and published? Is it possible to do it in Vietnam? 
 I have designed a series of IELTS Writing Task 2 textbooks that I’d like to publish (I’d also consider self-publishing, not too familiar with the best method)
 *if it helps to know, I possess a bachelors in English language from a top UK university, a Level IV TESOL and 5 years of IELTS teaching experience. 
 TIA!

                              <span>For those who didn&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a mini truck/tractor-like vehicle used for transporting materials for construction. Folks living in modern city areas might have the privilege of not having to witness or experience this atrocity.
 Man, screw this damned of an ancient, older than dino-fossil, out-dated, dirty vehicle that pumps out zillion tons of harmful smokes, from black to blue in color, to the atmosphere for every meter it goes.
 I live in a suburban area where construction of houses is frequent, and this damned vehicle goes rampant on the street, crossing my house once every 3-5 minutes for hours straight, that&#x27;s how crazy and obnoxious it is. My biggest problem is not its noise, but the amount of godawful enormous smoke emissions it produces.
 Ever travel on a road when you&#x27;re riding a bicycle BEHIND this monster ? Yeah dude, have fun inhaling ALL that smoke this vehicle constantly pumps out of itself all the way until you reach your destination. This thing should absolutely be banned for harmful effects to environment and people alike.
 That&#x27;s it. Thanks for coming to my TEDx talk

                              <span>I arrived in Da Nang a few days ago and on Tinder basically all the girls I have matched with keep inviting me for drinks at the “bar” they work at. It seems like this is a scam or a ripoff at best. Does anyone have firsthand experience going to one of these places? If I go what can I expect? A semi-decent time or is it just something I should absolutely avoid like the plague?

                              <span>Much of the developed world is expected to have an impending population crisis due to very low fertility rates. Although Vietnam&#x27;s fertility rate is below replacement level as well, it is still much higher than that of China/Japan/Korea/Taiwan/HK. There seems to have been a lot of economic growth and potential, but I don&#x27;t know much about geopolitics and economics.

                              <span>Hey Guys, I&#x27;ll be Visiting Vietnam in December, and booked a flight from Bamboo Airways for Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh. When i Booked, The website was set as Vietnam English (Locationa and Language) and I made the transaction in VND through an International Card. But when I&#x27;m checking the same flight through Trip.com or Global USD Mode of the Website, The prices are doubled. Did i just got a sweet deal or made a huge mistake? Will it be a problem if a foreigner has a ticket booked from the Website in VND? Please Help if you have some information regarding this. 
 Chào các bạn, tháng 12 mình sẽ về thăm Việt Nam và đặt vé máy bay Bamboo Airways đi Phú Quốc đi Hồ Chí Minh. Khi tôi đặt chỗ, trang web được đặt là tiếng Việt (Vị trí và ngôn ngữ) và tôi đã thực hiện giao dịch bằng VNĐ thông qua Thẻ quốc tế. Nhưng khi tôi kiểm tra cùng một chuyến bay thông qua Trip.com hoặc Chế độ USD toàn cầu của Trang web, Giá sẽ tăng gấp đôi. Tôi vừa có được một thỏa thuận ngọt ngào hay đã phạm một sai lầm lớn? Sẽ có vấn đề gì nếu người nước ngoài đặt vé từ Trang web bằng VNĐ? Xin hãy giúp đỡ nếu bạn có một số thông tin liên quan đến điều này.

Tôi chả biết là điều này đúng không nhưng tôi ước rằng sẽ được gặp em một lần nữa.

                              <span>Is there any stigma against them here? I know a woman, 28, who has photos of herself with her younger sister. Considering their 19 year age gap though, I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if the younger sister is her daughter. It&#x27;s the way she holds her that makes me consider this. 
 I wonder if she disguises her daughter as a younger sister just to avoid potential stigma.

 Sorry forgot to mention, no pho in the name please. Kinda of played out 🤷‍♂️. Something simple but would represent Vietnam.

                              <span>Looking for a beautiful place in nature to spend a few weeks relaxing. And exploring. 
 I like the sound of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park. Would prefer somewhere that’s calming, friendly locals and good nature to explore by bike. 
 Any specific suggestions for both places, and lodgings, would be really appreciated. 
 Thanks

                              <span>So I’m an American traveling and got here in Da Nang. It’s Saturday night here in Da Nang. I used one of the Sacombank’s ATM and it ate my card. I called the number on the ATM and told my situation. He says I need to call my own bank and get a confirmation letter saying that it’s my card and take that letter to a Sacombank’s branch here on Monday. So I called my own bank (Citibank) and they tell me that they can only provide a Reference Letter with my account number (not the Debit Card number) and it will take a week to get that letter or they can expedite a card and send it by Tuesday. The issue is, I leave here Tuesday morning to Hanoi. That card is my only card for cash and what not. What the hell do I do?

                              <span>Went to saigon just to watch HTL vietnamese concert. I just want to see her live and check on the concern scene.
 What I observed : 
 The concert venue looks like an old gymnasium with pipes on the way inside the concert grounds which is unsafe since someone can trip over. 
 But the stage and production value of the concert was superb. The stage has mulple large LED display panel, smoke effects and fire effects. There are orchestra situated in the back of large display panel. There is 3 or 4 different drones on the whole duration of the concert. And multiple cameras all over the place. 
 The songs performed was on her album hoang and link and the encore song is an unreleased song together with the artist in Gieo Que. 
 Most of the audience are singing along with the songs and they coordinatedly changing the color of their light sticks in the color of the LED display. 
 I really enjoyed the arrangement of the songs in the last 5 songs since it has a live rock band feel specially with the drummers performance. 
 About HTL performance though was underwhelming. Her voice feels to me is lipsynced (or maybe overprocessed?). There is no interaction with the audience and feels that it is a performance video and not a concert. I dont know if this a vietnamese thing since most of the concert i gone to has a least interaction to the fans / audience. 
 Overall i enjoyed the concert despite some flaws.

                              <span>Hi. I will be in Hanoi for 9 days next month and I am contemplating if I should go to Da Nang for 2-3 days or just stay in Hanoi all throughout.Is it worth it? Should I take a sleeper train or sleeper bus? Or will that take too much time? Is it better to get Airbnb or a beachside hotel?I initially wanted to go to Sa Pa but I checked the November temperatures in Sa Pa and I don&#x27;t think I can deal with the cold. I am from a tropical country.

                              <span>Just wondering. I mean in the US, we have Marilyn Monroe, and for guys we have something like Tom Cruise. In China, we have Fan BingBing who&#x27;s considered as a beauty goddess and countless male beauty icons. But for Vietnam, I&#x27;m struggling to think of a name
 Who&#x27;s the equivalent of them for Vietnam?

                              <span>My wife and I are having problem in financial management with child care expenses.
 We gave birth our daughter here. We spent a lot of money on her entertainment, health care, education… I hadn’t noticed much until I realized we spent over 50 million vnd on our daughter last month. I think it is quite much for me (i am bread winner). I ask this question to see how people spend money on raising kids in Vietnam and get some insightful suggestions. I need to reduce expenses (around 30-40mil is perfect) but still give our daughter the best things.
 Kindergarten Tuition: 15 mil
 Babysitter: 8 mil
 Child food and supplements: 12 mil 
 Child care product: 2 mil
 Clothes: 2 mil (she’s growing fast)
 Sport and entertainment: 3 mil
 Language education (English and Belarusian): 10 mil. My wife wants the daughter to speak mom’s language well. I can’t say no. I teach her Vietnamese with 0vnd. 
 Edit: please ignore my username, my wife just joked me :))

                              <span>We are going to Vietnam in January and had wanted to go to Sa Pa. I don’t mind the cold but with the fog we might not see anything. We are all over 75 and I read it could be muddy on the trek. My travel guy said not to worry because we can have our guide call a cab if it becomes difficult. Can anyone share their experiences on touring Sa Pa in January?

                              <span>Does anyone know why mussles aren&#x27;t prevelant in vietnamese cuisine? Or if there is a localised are where they are?
 From my understanding and experience, they are eaten in thailand, China, Malaysia etc but seem to be missing in vietnamese cusine. I know they have started to be farmed recently and I assume they must grow as they grow pretty much everywhere. Consequently most places I have had mussels here, even at good places, tend to be overcooked.

                              <span>Just like the title says, it&#x27;s a joke. And not even a funny one. And here&#x27;s my unhinged rant about it.
 Since the implementation of &quot;simulated situations&quot; test, the Vietnamese driving test has stooped to an absolute clusterfuck of bureaucratic mire, created by senile buffoons who I guaran-goddamn-tee you don&#x27;t have the slightest clue what&#x27;s it like to be behind the wheel.
 Here&#x27;s the premise: you&#x27;re given a medley of 10 clips, ranging from 40-50 seconds in length, showing situations that can happen on the road (the majority of them are half-baked 3D scenarios - how realistic). You have to press spacebar when you see a potentially dangerous action. There&#x27;s a set time limit in which you have to mash the button, and you&#x27;ll be graded anywhere from 0-5 depending on when you do it.
 Already this sounds like a horrible idea, knowing that there&#x27;s heavy implication that your intuition can fuck right off and this is strictly a memorize-and-answer kind of test. You can see the sitch and press spacebar ZERO POINT ONE SECOND EARLY and it will be a wrong answer.
 WHO THE FUCK IN THEIR RIGHT MIND THINKS IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO FORCE FEED THIS SORT OF HORSESHIT INTO PEOPLE&#x27;S HEADS AND CALL IT A &quot;TEST&quot;???
 Apparently the Ministry of Traffic and Transports, with their infinite fucking wisdom, alongside whoever ratify the change, do.
 And the tragedy is, it&#x27;s unlikely that this will be revoked, so anyone (including me) who thinks of getting a driver&#x27;s license now can either suck it up or go fuck themselves.

I&#x27;m doing a small research as part of my class where I have to interview tourists in the city about a topic. Can anyone currently in Nha Trang spare some times (just a few minutes) for me to interview you online? Please note that I have to record our talk, so please consider that. Thank you.

 There seems to be many to choose from, so we&#x27;re looking for recommendations of people/company you&#x27;ve had great experiences with. The majority of the group are older and enjoys history, bonus if the drivers can provide some insight on local history.
 Thanks!

                              <span>My bf has just rented a property in D1 and the apartment is great, it&#x27;s just there&#x27;s really bad mold on ceiling and it&#x27;s really smells after it rains heavily. Unsure if I can deal with, or I&#x27;m being paranoid. Do people live with these kind if problems in Vietnam? - am I being ridiculous to say I need to move out. Just worried it will get worse or atm is dangerous. We&#x27;ve just moved here aswell and planning to stay for 2 years. Any help or advice would be appreciated as I am anxious mess always so I never know if I&#x27;m over thinking...

                              <span>So, am going soon on a tourist visa, from UK. Wondered how and if I found work, how I could go about the visa process for working while there? I have a degree, TEFL, many years of teaching experience. Just don&#x27;t think I will be able to organise all the required paperwork before I leave in 4 weeks. Any advice? Thanks for reading.

I just recently got my Canadian citizenship and passport. If I am to fly back to Vietnam, would that cause an issue? I will be flying in and out of Vietnam with my Vietnamese passport.

 I am originally from Vietnam, have lived in US for years and want to move back to VN. I&#x27;ve been told after 1 year of living in Vietnam I can adopt domestically, but curious to know if anyone has done this?

My grandma ate american food around the same time and got so sick she was hospitalized and now can only eat white rice and meat. Did anyone else or your parents/grandparents experience this? I’m wondering if it’s less common now that american food franchises are popping up in vietnam.

                              <span>I think I can count at least 4 or 5 times (over of being randomly splashed with muddy water between the cracks of sidewalk tile squares. My guess is it’s the tiles that are sitting at an angle? 
 It’s funny but also not so funny sometimes. Considering walking in the road more haha. 
 Anyone else experience this? How many mines have you set off so far?

                              <span>So, I have only been here for 2 days. Call me crazy, but I feel like this is one of the nicest beach cities or beach/city that I have ever been to. I&#x27;ve lived in many places
  
Siargao Island, PH
 La Union Beach, PH
 Baler Beach, PH
 Cebu City, PH
 Bali, ID
 Jogja / Jogja Beaches, ID
 Hua Hin, TH (just 2 months)
  
Philippines used to be my home until I lost my job/home/friends during COVID. It was extremely painful for me and I never found a foot in Indonesia after the borders opened up. Being here in Da Nang is the first time since 3 years ago when I lost my home/everything that I get a sense of home and comfort even though I really can&#x27;t speak the language aside from a few phrases and tones are driving me crazy lol.
 It&#x27;s really nice here in Da Nang. Vietnamese people are kinder than I expected (people here say a lot of negative things about VN people), the beach is much cleaner than I expected as well. I just came from the beach and feel so refreshed. I love this city after just two days. It&#x27;s a wonderful setup that allows you to walk so easily north to south and hop into random coffee shops. I wish I could make this place my home. Although probably unlikely unless I move to HCM for a job but yea, this place is so great.
 The only thing that&#x27;s terrifying AF is how crazy you people drive here LOL!

                              <span>Hello.
 I went to the Dan Sihn market today. Great experience and saw a lot of war memorabilia, but I checked online and one article claimed up to 99% of the stuff was fake and most of the authentic things were bought a long time ago. This seems like an absurd number, so perhaps people here know this better than me; how much of the stuff sold there is real? Would you buy anything there?
 Thanks in advance. Having a great time in this wonderful nation!

                              <span>All my life I was taught to be polite and respectful to older people. But some older people are so rude but then if you say something back you’re hỗn láo bad guy
  
Scenario 1: at Tan Son Nhat, in TSA line, this lady was extremely close to me. Every time I moved up, she inched up directly next to me. So I said “Cô, làm ơn đứng xa xa một chút giùm.” She stopped standing close to me and didn’t say anything but then started whispering about me to her husband saying “Con nhỏ mất dạy.” Like wtf did I do 😭 
 
scenario 2: getting off the plane. I was removing my suitcase from the overhead compartment. You know viet aunties do that nudge thing if they need to get by or they’ll tap you and say move. Well this lady started to shove me aggressively. There was nowhere for me to move since the people in the row above me were in the aisle. The first one, two times I let it go, even the third. Then she kept doing it getting more aggressive each time. This is where I admit I was being really rude back. I turned to her and said “cái gì vậy.” She stopped shoving me and looked at me with full on rage in her eyes like this 😡. Like ma’am, you’re the one shoving me 😭 
 
 I used to always yield to older people but now I’m starting to talk back to them because they can’t demand respect without being polite to others first

                              <span>In fact my baby is still in my body. My husband and I will probably meet him in December.
 Since I moved to Vietnam with my husband, many family relatives, friends of husband, co workers of parents in law have come to visit me and my unborn baby.
 They gave us many things like baby clothes, toys, nutritional food, baby care products,…. The new thing to me is that there is always an envelop of money attached in these gifts. It is often from 1 million to 5 million vnd. The old uncle of my husband even gifted me and baby 1000usd. It is quite strange to me. I feel shy when receiving easy money from people like this. Then, I behaved unnaturally when receiving the gifts from them.
 My husband family even say they may come back after baby is born.
 Why did they do that if they had already gifted us expensive tangible things?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been solo traveling within Japan, even though it&#x27;s not my home country. I work here and have grown fond of exploring its diverse landscapes and culture. Now, with my birthday approaching, I&#x27;m considering a trip to Vietnam. Initially, I was thinking of Hanoi, but a Vietnamese friend suggested Hoi An in central Vietnam.
 Choosing between the two cities is a bit challenging. I usually start with major cities before exploring smaller ones, which leans towards Hanoi. However, the idea of a more relaxed, less touristy experience in Hoi An is appealing.
 I have six days and five nights, factoring in day trips to nearby places and wanting to immerse myself in local life, so I can&#x27;t visit both cities at the same time. I&#x27;m seeking advice from fellow travelers and locals on which city to begin with. I enjoy sketching buildings and nature, and exploring cafes, so finding the right backdrop for these activities is important.

                              <span>This may be a silly question. Is it possible to buy a good bicycle helmet in Hanoi? I&#x27;m assuming it is and there would be plenty of options but the bike tour group we are on asks that we bring them from home. Really don&#x27;t want to carry one around for two weeks before the cycling part of our trip.

                              <span>Just wondering, has anyone bought replica watch from him and his shop before? If so, how good is the quality ? I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s getting all his watches from the same chinese factory that all the other chinese seller are getting from. I&#x27;m heading back to VN in a few months, debating if I should buy from him or other well known rep sellers online. Thanks if you have any info.

                              <span>Im trying to learn vietnamese (i learned french earlier) and feel like so much of it has some french origin. Nearly every “basic” word i learned that has an everyday usage (nha ga, ca phe, va li, sa bong, pho mai) comes from some french word. Are the loanwords mostly found in simple everyday words or also more complex words/phrases (politics, emotions, technical terms, etc) as well?
 If it was possible to make an estimation, approximately how much of the vietnamese language is derived from french?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I just booked my honeymoon in Vietnam for Nov. 24-December 8th. Would love any suggestions on the itinerary below:
 November 24-26th: Hanoi November 27th: Bai Tu Long Cruise (2 day/ 1 night) November 28th: Hanoi (to rest after the cruise &amp; leave for Sa Pa early the next day) November 29th-December 2nd: Sa Pa December 2nd-6th: Hoi An/ An Bang Beach December 7th: last night in Hanoi before we fly out 
 I just had a few questions: 1. Firstly, I read that it’s the very end of the rainy season in Hoi A during early December. Do you think it’s still worth going and risking the rain, or would it be better to choose somewhere else? We want at least one relaxing beach time and also really wanted to see Hoi An. I also read it can be beautiful around Christmas. Is it worth it? Worried about being rained out the whole time but hoping if it’s at the end it might be okay. 2. Is Bai Tu Long bay as beautiful as Halong Bay? Worth it to book Bai Tu Long instead? 3. We’re planning on booking the EcoSapa limousine buses to/from Sapa and Hanoi. Are these a good choice?
 Any other recs/thoughts would be greatly appreciated (especially for a honeymoon vibe)! Thanks so much in advance ❤️

                              <span>This album is a fusion of traditional Vietnamese folk culture with contemporary music styles, incorporating themes and stories inspired by Vietnamese literature. The album showcases accents from all three regions, and it even includes a song reminiscent of &#x27;nhac do.&#x27; I&#x27;ve been listening to it on repeat since YouTube recommended the live showcase to me. What are your thoughts on this?
 I don&#x27;t often listen to Vpop, and I feel like I&#x27;ve been missing out on a lot by only focusing on K-pop for years. Which other artists and their releases do you recommend? I particularly enjoy Truc Nhan and Trung Quan, especially singers who perform well live.

 It came with chicken and veges like onions and tomatoes etc. that you can cook yourself, along with the best &quot;lemony salty&quot; sauce ever (bottom right corner in red bowl). 
 Thank you in advance for any suggestions 😃

                              <span>Are gay spas legal in Vietnam? Last week I went to a gay spa in HCM. I deadass thought it was gay friendly spa with cute masseurs, but nope... all customers were naked and they performed unholy acts in middle of the spa. No masseur and security in sight.
 While in the US this kind of establishment is regulaged by laws, and Paris, Berlin are more laxed with dresscode. But this spa was filled with naked men of all ages flinging their chuối and 2 quả chôm chôm. are these places legal to operate in Vietnam? Any raider by police?

                              <span>Just got off the phone with a relative in Vietnam who is trying to force her 23 year old daughter to move back in with her after she has created a life for herself in Toronto Canada.
 The daughter has become tremendously successful by every metric (has her own e-commerce business, active social life, makes 6 figures) but her mom keeps trying to guilt about how she could die any minute (either from poor health or suicide) and that it’s her “duty” to live with her mom.
 This is the same woman that forced her then 18 year old daughter to sleep in the same bed with her every night to prevent her from masturbating. When I ask my other relatives what they think they actually side with the mom and say the most important thing in life is being near family and this idea of “independence” and “adventure” is pointless and irresponsible. Lol
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Hello everyone in Vietnam!
 I&#x27;m planning a trip to Southeast Asia this January and need some advice. I&#x27;ve got an itinerary from Hue to Siem Reap via Da Nang and Hoi An, but I&#x27;ve hit a roadblock trying to find a convenient way to get to Siem Reap from these places. It seems like a direct flight isn&#x27;t an option, and the layovers could take up to 12 hours.
 Could anyone here help me out by suggesting a more efficient route or sharing any local insights? I&#x27;d really appreciate your input!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, I’m single m (31yo) Vietnamese but grew up in Germany. I’m interested in what fixed costs you have monthly. I have heard that in Vietnam what rent and food is very low. For me, for example, the two items already make up 40-45% of my income. (Berlin - top location / 3 rooms / 81qm)
 What else comes up are: Insurance, communication, mobility, loan repayments, etc. In the end, I&#x27;m left with about 10% of my net income per month to save, so not much either. You don&#x27;t get rich that way. How does it look in Vietnam?

I personally like Vietnamese people very much and they have their own unique character which I found very cool. I wanted to know how the Vietnamese community outside Vietnam lives like if they have good or bad experiences or do they live their life in a traditional way or in a Western way. Let me know in the comments!

 What would a foreigner expect to be paid in Vietnam working in tech?
 I&#x27;m aware there can be a big divide between what companies pay locals vs foreigners (such as pilots). I&#x27;m wondering if this is the same in the tech world, I have a Vietnamese partner and would like to move there at some point - but looking at the job adverts on indeed etc. and the salaries are tiny in comparison to where I am now (UK). Obviously the living cost in Vietnam is equally a lot less than UK but even so getting a nice apartment in Hanoi or Saigon could be comparative to some UK house prices.
 I&#x27;m a network engineer btw.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if I saw this correctly, but it appears that in noodleshops (or other small mom and pop viet food shops) there is a bowl or basket of cups. And if you want tea, you take your own cup and fill it up.
 But recently I noticed people use the cup and then place them directly back into the bowl. It doesnt appear as though the shop washed them before the next customer grabbed it and used it.
 And ive noticed this at multiple shops now. Is this a thing in vietnam?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 98-er graduated University since 2020. As you guess it: Covid (2020) - Lockdown (2021) - Economic recession (2022-now). 
 Me and my friends at around the same age have been seriously struggling to find decent jobs since the beginning of 2023. I thought I was lucky to find a job at a tech company with an &quot;ok&quot; salary (1000usd gross). Turned out the company is exploitative and management is extremely toxic and abusive. So back to the grind to find a job for the last couple of months. 
 Why are companies trying to tell us Gen Zs as unstable and indecisive in our careers when in reality, we&#x27;re (or most friends I know) just trying so hard to find a DECENT job where we can stick around for stability without being exploited to the point of mentally suffering to get by?
 Some recruiters even told me that my salary expectation was too high :) My expectation is 20-25M net/month?? Mind you, I have 4 years of experience, fluent at English and graduated from a top university in Aus. I know it largely depends on the job, industries... but it&#x27;s affected my self-esteem somewhat. 
 If you&#x27;re a young native Vnese are you going through the same thing?
 If not, please teach me how to sniff out the bad companies and find ones that pay you you&#x27;re worth?? Open to discuss further
 Edit: I live in HCM, the most expensive city in this country so my expected salary is just enough for me to pay rent, groceries, have very fundamental household needs fulfilled and left with around 2-3mil extra to save. I dont think its too much to ask..

                              <span>I moved to Vietnam this year about six months ago. Almost right on cue, I started to have stomach problems, mainly in the form of diarrhea. Curiously, aside from two particularly awful days, it rarely manifests as outright food poisoning where it affects me the whole day. Rather I&#x27;ll get &quot;you have 30 seconds to comply&quot; situations. Cafe sua especially has a tendency to cause this roughly 1/4 of the time, so I just avoid it now.
 If I cook at home or eat more expensive foreign cuisine like Korean or Japanese food, the problem alleviates and my bowels actually become normal. However, if I go out to eat Vietnamese food (even at busy restaurants with high turnover) or drink cafe coffee (including even some supposedly safe looking coffee shops like Cafe Amazon), it&#x27;s only a matter of time before things rear their ugly head again. Most of the time, I&#x27;ll be fine, but I feel like a bout or two of diarrhea (but not out and out food poisoning, I never throw up or feel nauseous) every two weeks isn&#x27;t normal. It feels like a shame to not feel comfortable eating the local food due to these issues. 
 I have never had these issues before, and the timing from my arrival here (as well as its alleviation when i switch to home cooking only) is quite conspicuous. From what I hear, travelers diarrhea is supposed to resolve within a few weeks, not six months. Has anyone else experienced these issues? Is my stomach just not built for here?

                              <span>Since I came back I have been overwhelmed with how much people talk about money, about rich and poor as if those are the only things that matter. Everybody wants to know how much you make, all the news and social posts are money-related subjects. when i lived in Manhattan, money comes up in convos very often but here in Vietnam, all the jokes, all the memes, all the articles, conversations with friends family or random grab drivers are about money and materials. Been back here for two years and still experiencing this culture shock. I do feel like an alien sometimes. Anybody have advice to overcome this culture shock?

                              <span>Recently there was a video of a teacher bullying a student. The reason is because that student didn&#x27;t buy desserts from the bakery the teacher told her to buy. And then later the headmaster of that school wants to punish the student who upload the video. They are trying to cover their wrong doing and warn others not to publish the evidence to save the school&#x27;s face. 
 Vụ này ở VN mấy ngày nay nổi rầm rầm chắc ai cũng biết. Vấn đề là mình cảm thấy những vụ liên quan đến bạo lực học đường, dù là do giáo viên hay học sinh bắt nạt lẫn nhau, đều bị nhà trường hoặc cố giấu nhẹm hoặc là lờ đi không hề nhắc đến, có vụ nữ sinh tự tử do bị bắt nạt quá đà mà nhà trường biết nhưng cố tình ép nữ sinh đi học để bị bắt nạt tiếp, trong khi đó không hề đứng ra xử lý gì việc bắt nạt. 
 Cái này rõ ràng ai sống ở VN đều biết là để giữ điểm thành tích, thanh danh cho nhà trường. 
 Nghĩ ai còn đang đi học với ai có con cái còn đi học sẽ thấy thế nào, hoặc là bị bắt nạt rồi đến mức phải chuyển trường, thành vết sẹo tâm lý, trong khi đó không ai bênh vực cả. Nếu ko có những clip bằng chứng như vậy ai sẽ biết đến vụ việc bị bắt nạt? Mà giờ còn phạt cả những ai dám nói, dám đưa clip lên nữa.
 Các bạn nghĩ sao về vụ này?

 ​
 I would like to see if people have any recommendations with the following information
  
A cruise recommendation that doesn&#x27;t have all families and couples
 Any insight or clear justification for us to choose a cruise from either either Ha Long Bay or Cat Ba
  
Thanks in advanced!

                              <span>Hi all! I’m moving to Ho Chi Minh in November (long term) and I’d like some suggestions on cellphone plans and sims that offer either unlimited data or a decent amount of data, as well as calls and texts. I’ve heard about Viettel and Vinaphone but I can’t find the actual process of setting up a sim that isn’t a tourist sim. Any help would be appreciated 🙏 thank you!

                              <span>Hello, I am a foreigner working remote in Vietnam. I have a partial citizenship due to me being Vietnamese. 
 I heard there was opportunities to make some extra side money by helping with student assignments or something along those lines.
 So I was wondering if anyone knew about that or any other possible ways to earn extra money while I’m here.
 Side note: can’t speak Vietnamese , only understand it for the most part. Full English speaking, degree in business and economics. Doing salesforce admin work remotely.

 Planning to explore Vietnam in early December. Will Ninh Binh and Ha Long be good to visit before 10th of December? In terms of the clarity of views and overall weather in general.
 Thanks in advance. :)

                              <span>Here I will answer how to get the vat refund. When you buy any item in Vietnam. Costly items like electronics, phone, camera etx. The shop needs to fill up the customs declaration form. It will mention your passport details. Entry exit date, expiry date etc. You can claim the vat refund only if you are on a tourist visa, exiting the country. At the airport, you need to go to the customs office. At Hanoi airportz it&#x27;s little tricky. The security, police don&#x27;t understand English. I asked 4 people. They could not answer. Information desk could not explain me even after I showed the translator. Eventually I found out the customs office. 
 I presented the customs declaration form to the officer. He took 2-3 minutes to verify it and forwarded to a clerk of MSB bank who was sitting at the next counter. She asked me to sign couple of forms. Then provided me 85% of the total vat. She paid me in cash USD. Entire process took 10 minutes. That&#x27;s all.

                              <span>I just got a new job that requires 1hr commute each way on a motorbike during peak hours, and on terrible roads. I&#x27;m considering buying a new motorbike that is:
  
Comfortable on long ride and bumpy road
 It doesn&#x27;t have to be super fast, but it needs to have good acceleration from dead stop because that would make life easier when I&#x27;m stuck in traffic jam
 Decent storage space because I need to keep a spare helmet + my bag and other stuff
 Is not too short. I was considering Leads but as a 6&#x27;0 guy, my legs are bent too much riding a Leads
 Not too expensive like SH

                              <span>For reference, I was born in the US. My dad born in Vietnam but lives in the US. 
 I was texting my dad and he kept referring Buddha as a god. I personally don&#x27;t practice any religions. But from what I read, there isn&#x27;t a god in buddism? That got me thinking, is it practiced differently in Vietnam than in the US?
 He was texting me that whether or I was born with one arm, wheel chair bound, or gay, that he still loves me because I was Buddha god gift to him?
 Edit. Sorry did not mean to god gift. His exact words were &quot;god give ba boy or girl or gay ba love all&quot;.

                              <span>Sorry if this kind of question has already been asked. I’ve lived in Vietnam for 7 years and tried my fair share of dishes.. some of my favorites being bún riêu, chả cá, bún chả, cơm sườn, cơm rang dưa bò, and pho cuốn. I used to write about food and honestly if it’s a popular dish I’ve probably tried it! 
 Im curious to try some more niche dishes - things you don’t see every day. Perhaps specialities from remote areas. Something like cơm hến in Huế, for example. 
 Let me know some of your gems 💎 thanks.

                              <span>I (F) am travelling to Vietnam next week with my Boyfriend (super excited about this, fingers crossed) 
 I&#x27;ll be staying in Danang for the first few days and have a day trip planned to Hoi A on a weekday. My plan is to use Grab for a cab ride back to Danang at night. I&#x27;m seeking advice on the optimal departure time from Hoi An at night, wondering when Grab taxi services typically stop operating in the area.
 The intent is to maximise night time at Hoi An because I have heard the city is very charming at night but I can’t stay in Hoi an and have to come back to Danang at night.
 Additionally, I&#x27;d like to know if traveling at night in this route is considered safe?

                              <span>I notice ibuprofen and tylenol are more expensive here then USA. Is there a cheaper alternative? I use for general pain such as headaches or body aches.

 Edit 1: Absolutely overwhelmed by not just the openness but also the support for each other in this thread. Such an eye-opener for me personally. Loving the spirit everyone!!!
 Edit 2: I especially love the openness to share how much we make here! For some reason, I was taught that talking about salary is sensitive and whatnot but why we need to hide it right!!! It only benefits employers if we hide it 😆

                              <span>So, I was job hunting, and this company (they claimed they&#x27;re Vissan which is a decently big Food product company in Vietnam) contacted me. They sent an email for a physical interview that is set for this weekend, in the meanwhile they did this &quot;online prequalification&quot; that has to go through Telegram.
 The first part of this bullcrap is an MBTI test(?) that contains only like 5 questions. Am I that out of touched to the HR world that MBTI is a standard thing now?
 The second part is the relatively well-known scam that has been floating around recently, which is inputting data and get money from a lottery platform, all in the guys of &quot;making extra revenue&quot;. First they sent me 150k to add to the platform, so I played along for a bit, got 330k in return. They seems to be impressed that they started telling me about the 4 tiers of data entry, which basically is an ever increasing amount of money in return for a (supposedly) even higher amount. Of course that first run was a trial period, the 2nd run will be a 40-60 shares of profit for the company. And on top of it, the lowest tier they put up is 600k, which is just above the amount that I just earned, which means I have to pour money out of my own pocket for them.
 Here&#x27;s where I cut things off. This is too many red flags with screaming horns in my head. No fucking way a company would take money from their applicants. The funniest thing is that they even have the audacity to breath out that sentence I screenshotted above. I guess taking 330k from them is not much but it still filled my pettiness with something close to pride.
 So tl;dr: I have an encounter with a scam group that masquerading as a legit company. Took some money from them instead.

                              <span>Hi, I have food-related question here: are beef or pork intestines popular dishes in Vietnam?
 I have plan to come to vietnam second time. i want to cook some korean food for bf extended family. My favorite one is Gopchang (grilled pork and beef intestines)
 I asked bf, but he said it’s not popular. I guess he just wants me to persuade me to cook another dishes, because he can not eat intestines 😚😙😗
 If you guys eat intestines, what is your favorite type of cooking? In Korea, we often do barbecue (grill). Are there any Korean dishes, which Vietnamese people love? I’m willing to learn and cook for them
 Last time, I asked “how to impress viet parents” in this sub. Your suggestions helped me a lot, and I was successful. Thank you 🙏 🙏

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m traveling to VN soon and wanted to get my friend who loves self-care a gift from the states. Are there any brands or products that are sought after or hard to find in VN that I could get here in the states?
 Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!
 edit: preferably something not Dior or Chanel( because I know she has a bunch), would something like Hourglass, Glossier, or Kosas work? She&#x27;s in her late 20s.

                              <span>Greetings all. I bought some of this grape candy to try and was surprised to find a very hard kernel inside. My kids chomped right down into it, assuming it was a hard candy intentionally placed at the center of this soft jelly-like candy. I just had a crown placed so no way I’m biting something this hard, haha!
 Any idea what the kernel is? I tried to take a picture of it (2nd photo). Many thanks in advance!

                              <span>This goes back by about five generations at least but does anyone else have stories of relatives who were sent to Reunion Island due to French slaver trade or know more about the history of that place and era around 1600-1700?
 I&#x27;m not interested in raising animosities but would like to learn more about the era and see if others are searching or have their own family stories from the era as there&#x27;s word from a grandparent&#x27;s grandparent that some relatives were captured and sent there. 
 Are there any Vietnamese memorials, communities in Reunion Island or organizations dedicated to those who were stolen as a result?

                              <span>Hi,
 My name’s Dom and I’m part of an all asian theater collective based in Montreal! 
 We are travelling to Vietnam to do research for our next show. We will be in Hanoi from October 24 to 29 and Saigon from 29 to the 2!
 I was wondering if you guys had any theater plays or concerts we could go to while we are there!
 I’ve looked at the productions at the Saigon Opera House but, we’re looking for something a bit more contemporary/avant-garde if that’s possible! 
 Anyways, if you have any artistic recommandations (contemporary danse shows, art museums, alternative music, great coffee shops, librairies,etc..) or are an artist in Vietnam, it would be amazing to connect! 
 Thanks!

                              <span>This question might be silly but I’m just curious. I’m watching Young Sheldon (the series is set in Medford, Texas in the 80s-90s btw), and Sheldon has a Vietnamese friend named Tam. His mom always packs dimsum for him, to the point he’s sick of it.
 Dimsum is generally a Chinese food. I know we have dimsum here too but it’s still thought of as a Chinese food, or đồ Hoa.
 So my question is, do Vietnamese Americans have dim sum for lunch that often too? Or is it just another case of filmmakers/showrunners mixing up Asian people and following stereotypes?
 Again, this is just me contemplating about things in life. No big deal either way. So let me know your perspective. Thank you.

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 Im coming to Vietnam, to Ho Chi Minh 11th October, and I&#x27;m really confused. We have 11 days available and we returning to the same airport. My question is: What to do there? :) I had a lot of work before holiday and I couldn&#x27;t prepare for this. Im starting now :) 
 I was wondering about rental motorbike, but im not sure cause im going with my girlfriend and we have 2 big backpacks. What do you think guys?
 And im looking for something special, im not big fan of architecture, rather we prefer local experience and nature. I don&#x27;t like the crowds too, but I know that&#x27;s normal in big cities and popular attractions. 
 ​
 In short - can you give us some hidden gems? And what do you think about rental 2 bikes ( My GF is driver too) and traveling from Ho Chi Minh to Hoi An. Or maybe we should take a plane and rent bikes there? And last but not least - weather. Im a little nervous when I see a forecast.

                              <span>Hi guys, I currently want to learn more about Vietnamese history especially about the Dynasties and fashion back then. But I don&#x27;t know where to start or to get actual sources from, would be helpful if anyone recommend where to learn starting from the beginning, either in Tiếng Việt or English is fine. Cảm ơn

                              <span>As per title, recently those type of questions pop up rather frequently in this sub to the point I find it unreasonable. 
 The more of those questions pop up and the more I read into it, the less I see it is related to the Vietnamese country/ the culture/ the people.
 It might only have to do with that particular, very specific family/ relationship/ situation being in question. Regardless the whole nation is called into question for some behavior.
 You guys do know that Vietnam is a country of over 100m population, with polarized income and living conditions, plus having worldwide diasporas (in North America, Australia, European continent, African continent, East Asia, the Middle East) so finding an average Nguyen is nigh impossible, right???
 Instead of asking “Why my Vietnamese relative treat me like shit?” or “Why Vietnamese male drink coffee all morning and doesn’t go to work?” People can rephrase it such as “why my relative treat me like shit?” - does the fact that they are Vietnamese or Vietnamese immigrants play any roles in the question?

My dad has 13 other siblings most of which live in America as well, and for whatever reason it’s like every week they pick and choose whether to treat me, my mom, and my dad like shit or not. it’s like a sick ranking! it’s horrible. especially after my dad died and they barely cared, he died in a horrible car accident too, and yet we barely get any phone calls, much less any sympathy at all from them. it’s been 10 months now that he’s gone and yet they always gossip, body-shame, manipulative, clout-chase, and make me and my mom feel horrible! and we didn’t even do anything… my mom is vietnamese too and she’s the sweetest person ever. just, why? why are they so mean? is it because they are vietnamese? or jealous? what’s going on? i always feel like i’m doing something wrong, like i’m actually too pu**y, but heck am i gonna say to them, i don’t like ur 30 LV bags?

                              <span>I’m a woman born in Europe and my parents are Vietnamese.
 My father teaches me that it’s a woman’s job to take care of the household and the kids. Meanwhile he expects me to do a master’s degree and work full time as well. He teaches me things like: - It’s fine for men to have a high body count before marriage but girls should keep themselves pure - It’s a woman’s job to do the cooking, cleaning, etc. (including things like having to cut my husband’s finger and toe nails) - I shouldn’t do a doctor’s degree because men are deterred from women with higher education - It’s justified if my husband cheats if I don’t provide him with a warm meal and children
 My mother works full time as well but he feels entitled to everything she does for him. If there’s no food or the food is too salty for example, he starts to shout and says “without me, you would be living in the streets.”
 Is that normal for our Vietnamese culture? I’ve never seen him grateful for how we support him.

                              <span>Hello! As the title already states, which city is the best to visit in December?
 My best friend and I haven&#x27;t seen each other for years (we live in different countries now) and we&#x27;re thinking of travelling and reuniting in Vietnam. 
 We both would like to indulge ourselves in Vietnam&#x27;s food and culture. We both enjoy long walks, have some drinks, and trying out some things new! (something more &quot;local&quot; and maybe not too touristy haha)
 Any recommendations and suggestions are highly appreciated. Thank you! :)

                              <span>I will be backpacking through Vietnam and Cambodia in November and am looking for what kind of shoes I should bring. Looking at a lot of reddit posts I&#x27;ll probably bring some sandals (maybe Columbia Breaksiders?) for light walks and water activities but I will also go to Sa Pa and other places where I would like to hike. Since the weather won&#x27;t be as hot as in the summer, do you guys think some light hiking boots would be a good idea as a second pair and if so do you have any suggestions (I looked at the Merrell Nova 3 Mid for example)? I like hiking shoes that go over your ankles to prevent injuries on rugged terrain.
 Thank you guys in advance!

                              <span>Hey all,
 Not super interested in doing a cruise but a traveller in passing mentioned Cat Ba does fishing boat tours. Haven’t been able to find much information online about them, do they exist and what do they involve in finding out about them? Also any other general Cat Ba recommendations are welcome!

                              <span>Hoping this messages helps other travelers - if you’re from the US and are trying to use your Wise card it’s not supported here. Cambodia too
 After reading that it’s not uncommon for foreign bank cards to not work at some ATMs, I laced up my walking shoes and tried literally 17 ATMs, all unsuccessfully. I always tried 2 mil, I tried adding money to my USD wallet, I tried walking to the CitiBank atm, nothing. Eventually I went to the Wise website to see if something was locked with my card and I stumbled on a support page that listed countries that US accounts won’t work in. 
 I have a card from my US bank so I’ll probably just take the fee on the chin or consider using the Western Union app to send myself some money in the morning.

                              <span>I am vietnamese living in Canada for 6 years. I had a Canadian gf, and she’ll become my fiancé soon this year.
 I have a plan to come back to my country and work there for a long time. I asked my gf, and she agreed to relocate with me. We’ll move to vn in February next year. I am happy she’s willing to follow me. But I’m worried that she may struggle to adapt to living and workenvironment in Vietnam.
 As a foreigner living vn, what were your difficulties in living and working? Esp female foreigners (female and male may have different concerns). How did you overcome them?
 What can I do to help her go through tough time? She doesn’t need to worry about money, living place. We only care how she can get a good job, have positive experience and avoid being culture shocked or anxious
 She wants to learn the language. Can you suggest any language centers or tutors teaching foreigners Vietnamese?
 Any Vietnamese or foreigner having the same situation here, can you share your experience? I appreciate all your suggestions!!!!
 You may wonder why I don’t stay in Canada. I actually got PR of Canada. I am working for an American firm. The company is building a new factory in a north province of vietnam. I was chosen to work as one of managers in that factory, because I can speak the language. I will work in my home country like “expat” 😂😂. This is also a good chance for me to make a big chunk of money.😁

I want to move back, probably HCMC, but also worry if I can’t find a decent jobs to continue paying bills and rent. Have any of you been in my situation? TIA

 Any usual pitfalls/quirks about landlords and realtors? Should something be explicitly checked for and settled at the contract stage? Are large deposits and commissions common?
 Any info from your experience would be of a great help :)
 I will be most likely settling in District 7, since thats where my office will be, and hearing that its a lot more spacious, green and unconjested compared to the center districts.

                              <span>Hi! I’m strongly considering working remotely in Asia since my employer does not mind global relocation. 
 A few stops on this hypothetical trip will be Philippines, Japan and Vietnam.
 Never been to Asia, no clue what to expect. 
 Are there many digital nomads working abroad in this fashion? Are foreigners generally well regarded?
 Where are some common or recommended areas to do something like this?
 Forgive my ignorance, thought I’d post here to get some general feedback.

 Trước đó 1-2 tháng mình đã đem laptop đi vệ sinh, dán keo ở tiệm người quen của ông cậu.
 Tụ dưng 2 ngày nay Quạt laptop Dell 7730 của mình lại kêu không ngừng nghỉ , dù chả có tác vụ nặng nào ngoài lướt Chrome như thường lệ, trước đây trừ khi dùng Ai, Ps mới kêu to.
 ** Trước đây lướt Chrome quạt có kêu nhưng ko liên tục 2 ngày ạ.Hình 1 là ảnh mình chụp dc khi bật máy tính, dựa vào từ khóa &quot;manufactoring&quot; đi tra GG thì có kết quả hình 2 ạ, câu cuối cùng của nó làm mình rén quá.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always wondered why the Viets always drive in different lanes at the same exact speed in highways and express ways (including big fucking trucks staying in all the lanes, super frustrating but never mind), and after watching this video I realize it&#x27;s a bigger problem that it&#x27;s affecting many other countries, even the US
 Since I&#x27;m from the EU, I had no idea how it worked elsewhere, but it&#x27;s just common sense in the EU to not stay constantly in the left lane unless I&#x27;m passing someone else. I believe in some countries you can get even fined if you occupy the left lane for no reason 
 Do you believe a culture of left lane for passing only can be adopted here? Or is it too late now to create such culture? (talking about the highways reserved for cars only, not the normal roads)

                              <span>Hi everyone! Australian here who will be travelling for the first time to Vietnam for one week. I love Vietnamese food (Banh Mi, soups and salads) and excited to try authentic fare as well as experience the culture. Some of my questions and concerns needing answers from travelers who have been there: -Visa. I believe visitors will need a visa to enter. Could anyone share the link to apply for the visa application? Can it be an online application, how much and how long to get the visa. -Money to get around. Are credit cards accepted or only cash? -Wifi access. Would getting a local SIM to access the internet be the best way? Do the Vietnamese telcos offer inexpensive prepaid SIMs and roughly how much? -Must sees and do&#x27;s in Ho Chi Minh. Recommended places of interest to see and unique experiences would be great. -Souvenirs. What&#x27;s good to bring home from Vietnam? I would appreciate your practical tips and suggestions. Thanks in advance.

The communities are strong and supportive. The people are kind, welcoming, and patient. There is one thing that drives me crazy though. I routinely find the process of asking a question and receiving a response from Vietnamese people to be painful. The same goes for politely declining invitations. I say no politely time after time after time and it doesn&#x27;t seem like anyone hears me unless I get animated, frustrated, exasperated, or leave. The same goes for answering questions.

                              <span>Hello, 
 As the title says, I got an offer from ILA for Can Tho! On the surface, things sound pretty decent, especially since they offer a housing allowance. 
 My pay according to the contract (before taxes) is 473,000 VND an hour (20 teaching hours a week), on top of a housing allowance of 7,000,000 VND per month. It&#x27;s a standard 12-month contract. 
 My main priorities are to learn how to be a good teacher, save as much as I can, and try to avoid stress as much as possible. That being said, I want to make sure ILA is a good fit for me. I don&#x27;t mind the region I&#x27;m staying in (Can Tho) since I doubt I&#x27;m gonna leave my apartment much... for me, the priority is just learning a local culture and saving money. 
 Does anyone have any experiences with ILA that they&#x27;d be willing to share? I understand that avoiding stress is impossible as a teacher, but I just want to make sure that they&#x27;ve got a good support system in place. The last thing I want is to be overworked or overwhelmed with stuff that they didn&#x27;t mention in the interview or the contract... only to realize I could&#x27;ve had that same experience here, in the states. 
 Long story shrot, this is the only offer I think I&#x27;ll be getting from Vietnam... and I&#x27;m stuck between taking it and just giving up and sticking to living in the states. I don&#x27;t want to go overseas and get burned out on teaching since I&#x27;m gonna be doing that for a living... 
 Please let me know, thank you.

                              <span>For my fellow expats and everyone&#x27;s safety, last week I didn&#x27;t have enough cash on hand so i had to use my credit card at a lounge here in HCMC however, i woke up this morning and found out i was charged a ridiculous amount by the same place. (which i didn&#x27;t make). To be honest i think they got a hold of my credit card information and now i have to dispute this. I just thought i&#x27;d share this so please be careful and aware everybody. 
 It&#x27;s in D1 , and the credit card dispute team can&#x27;t help me right now at the moment because of the time zone differences so I&#x27;ll have to wait until night time to settle this . 
 This really sucks, but i would share this because I wouldn&#x27;t want anybody to deal with a situation like this, especially overseas.

 6 women, including 4 Vietnamese, were rescued by French police in the back of a refrigerated truck after sending a text message asking for help.
 French police announced that they stopped a refrigerated truck on September 27 on the E15 highway near Drace, north of Lyon and discovered 6 women, including 4 Vietnamese and two Iraqis, in the cramped trunk full of bananas. BBC reported on September 28.
 Laetitia Francart, prosecutor of the Villefranche-sur-Saone region, north of the city of Lyon, eastern France, said the group of women got into the back of a truck with Irish license plates hoping to reach Britain or Ireland.
 However, this vehicle only carries goods to Dunkirk, France and then hea…</span>

They usually watch reruns when it is on and always laugh and enjoy it, but when I ask them about actually going to see it live they seem indifferent.
 Are older Vietnamese parents actually into PBN and secretly would love to go? Or do they not really care for the program all too much?

                              <span>Like seriously, today I walked into a post in this sub. And it reeks with colonial mentality. This has been a serious issue I have with my fellow Vietnamese in a long time. So, I would like to hear your opinions about it today.
 I would like to start with my first experience with this issue. After I finished with my university, I got hired into a Vietnamese branch of a Japanese self-driving car start up. Things were fine back then except for one thing. My CEO. He was a total Japanese-supremacy guy (He is Vietnamese, btw). One day, me and my senior had to work overtime to fix some issues that the our Japanese colleagues made. It was a mismanagement problem, so while we were okay with working overtime to fix it, we thought it would be more productive to raise this problem in the next meeting…</span>

 Xin chào mọi người, post này tôi sẽ nói tiếng Việt.
 Gần đây… không hẳn là thời gian gần đây nữa mà là hơn 8 tháng rồi… đã xảy ra một vụ án thương tâm tại Chung cư Centana ở thủ đức. Nạn nhân ở đây là người phụ nữ Phan Thị Mỹ Hằng.
 Thoạt đầu tưởng rằng chỉ là trò bịp bợm của ai đó trên mạng nhưng hóa ra không phải. Khi thấy điểm bất ngờ nên tôi đã nghiên cứu qua thử thì thấy có rất nhiều điểm đáng để nói trong vụ án lần này.
 Trước khi tới tình tiết phân tích chuyên sâu, nếu ai đã đọc quyển sách Đêm trường tăm tối của Tử Kim Trần thì sẽ thấy sự giống y hệt xã hội chúng ta đang sống hiện tại. Càng đọc, càng thấy sự na ná và tôi mong nếu bạn đang đọc đến dòng này, thì hãy đọc tiếp vì bạn sẽ cảm thấy bất ngờ.
 Vụ án kể về hơn một chục năm trước, tại…</span>

                              <span>Specifically my cat. She is a 6kg (~12lb) American Short Hair, fully vaccinated. Please let me know the necessary documents and procurers for bringing cats into Vietnam through Noi Bai International Airport. 
 It would also be greatly appreciated if yall can give me some recommendations on airlines that will be allowing pets. I&#x27;m coming from Canada and it looks like I will be transferring through an intermediate airport. Last time I checked Taiwan doesn&#x27;t allow live animals in so Eva Air is cancelled out. 
 Thanks a lot.

                              <span>Hello! Asking for a friend...
 What are the realistic job opportunities in HCMC and/or Hanoi for someone who speaks neither English nor Vietnamese? More specifically, for someone who speaks Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese (has Italian and Brazilian citizenship), and who has work experience in programming, IT, and graphic design, and also has &quot;uncertified&quot; skills in construction and furniture building? 
 I know that being a Digital Nomad or working remotely for a European country are obvious answers, but I&#x27;m wondering about on-the-ground, potentially Visa-sponsored gigs? I do not yet live in Vietnam, so when I search on my Dell from the USA, even if I search in Spanish (my second language), my results are highly skewed and unhelpful.
 If anyone has links, knows of good recruiting companies, or anything, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it! Equally, if the answer is that my friend would be SOL, thank you for the frankness 😅

                              <span>I just got to Da Nang. I took a Grab to my hotel, but didnt realize the Grab wanted me to pay in cash. I eventually found an ATM and paid the guy 100,000 instead of 57,000 (which is still cheap by US terms i think).
 How much cash should I keep on hand? In case a place Im at does not accept cards. Also, how do I find an ATM?

                              <span>I just don&#x27;t know, I just find Chinese music and lyric much more lyrical, meaningful and impactful. I&#x27;m just attracted to it more, the lyric, the melody, the words. 
 I do not support and could not stand China&#x27;s conservative politic and misogynistic attitude. I hate them to the core, but I just really really love the art side of its culture, its music and its architecture. I&#x27;m just much more drawn to them and find them more attractive. It&#x27;s just that, you know, China has been our life-long &quot;enemy&quot;, I feel like it&#x27;s wrong of me to like things from them

                              <span>There seems to be a lot of regional variation. I think the standard rule (if there is such a thing), is to use the same address (anh, chi, em) based on one&#x27;s own sibling&#x27;s age. But what about if the husband or wife of your sibling is younger than you? In most traditions, you still follow the &quot;standard rules&quot;, but I&#x27;ve met people who address the younger (in age) sibling-in-law as &quot;chu, cau, co, di&quot;, as though they were addressing them in place of their children. What tradition do you follow, dear Redditors?

                              <span>I will be traveling to HCMC in December. I have a bunch of medications. Gabapentin, muscle relaxers, beta blockers, Ubrelvy for migraines, epi-pen and benedyl for food allergies, and Aleve and Tylenol. I wanted to make sure that bringing in medications like these are safe? I also have a cream that contains Ketamine but I would assume a med like this would cause problems. Any advice would be appreciated thank you so much.

                              <span>I have a brother. My dad mentioned him once when I was young, didn’t bring him up for years, then finally told me about him again and confirmed it wasn’t a fever dream. 
 My brother would be in his mid to late thirties. My dad was half white and was kicked out of the hospital by my brother’s grandma. He wasn’t allowed to see his son after that. My dad eventually made it to America but has always missed my brother. My grandma did not know of my brother because he was born out of wedlock. I accidentally let it slip. 
 I’m contemplating doing a DNA test and potentially finding him. I want to do an American one as well since my grandpa (my dads father) was a lieutenant during the war. Though, I do want to meet my brother the most. To let him know my dad didn’t willingly abandon him. Have them meet. Help my grandma meet her first grandchild as she always thought I was the first. 
 If anyone has any insight, that’ll be extremely helpful. Thank you.
 Edit: when I ask, “do people in Vietnam do these tests” it’s because I’m asking if it’s commonplace and if it’s as popular in other countries. I want to see if there is any percentage of a chance it’ll work.

                              <span>In your opinion, other than the An Thuong area, what is a desirable neighorhood(s) in Danang for locals?
 An Nhon (near Korea town) seems pretty nice. Also the area near the Foreign Language University.
 But i have a hunch that I havnt really found the desirable, nice Danang neighborhood yet. Any tips where I can look?

 We love to drink and eat good food. She is very interested in renting a moped, but I can’t seem to find a tour where a guide takes us around and we drive them ourselves. Something unique would be awesome!!

                              <span>Firstly, let me preface this by saying I adore Vietnam, the culture, the strong will and tenacity of the people in the face of adversity, the dynamism, the air of progress, and the fascinating history, museums and sites. 
 That said, I have one major point of complaint: the state of infrastructure - in particular - transport infrastructure - in the country, is totally unacceptable. 
 Now I know Vietnam is still a relatively poor country, and is still significantly behind the likes of Thailand or Malaysia in economic development (although it is progressing rapidly). But even for a country at its income level (real per capita GDP of $15k), it’s still not good enough. And fixing it will be crucial if Vietnam is to have sustainable long run economic success and capitalise on current investment…</span>

 Also, what vaccines and over the counter medications are recommended? 
 Thank you in advance! I can’t wait.

                              <span>2 weeks ago, I posted a post about my concern as I didn’t wrote enough words in the writing, and I assumed I would just get only 5 in that part. However, I just got the result this morning. Guess what, I got 6 with an overall score of 7. It took me 2 months to reach this score, and I’m so f cheerful about it. Anyway, i just want to spread my happiness.

                              <span>Idk if this is the right place to post here. I feel like Zalo’s the most popular messaging app in Vietnam so maybe the story would make sense to some here, to some extent. 
 For context: I broke up with my ex over 3 years ago and we haven’t talked ever since. It was a peaceful, face-to-face breakup. When we were together she made an IG for me bc I didn’t use IG (she only posted fluffy lovey dovey stuff of us there, I didn’t have access to it). I have been together with my current gf for almost 2 years. 
 For the main story, I was using my gf’s phone and while on her app switcher screen, I saw she was browsing my ex-made instagram account on Zalo browser. I got startled and immediately went to the Zalo app to see how she came across it. 
 Apparently “I” was the one who sent it to her on Zal…</span>

                              <span>Once a week or so I try to make a habit of giving a little money to a beggar. I just want to check that in giving it to the people that need it the most. Are lotto ticket sellers basically verified as poor and are given those tickets by the government to sell? They only get a commission per ticket so it&#x27;s better for them if I just give them the cash and let them keep the ticket?
 I&#x27;ve also been told to avoid giving money to women carrying drugged babies and children selling stuff, particularly around Bui Vien they are owned by mafia and don&#x27;t get to keep the money themselves/ aren&#x27;t allowed go to school.
 Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong with anything as I&#x27;m only going off what I&#x27;m told.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My recently purchased Galaxy S23 on the US Verizon network won&#x27;t unlock automatically for another month. Verizon refuses to do it before then. I want to use a local sim when I arrive on Friday but would need to get the phone unlocked. 
 I&#x27;ll be staying in D1 on PNL. Any recommendations for some place that can network-unlock my phone for me?
 Thanks everyone!
 Edit: I would like a local phone number so I can use Grab.

Any suggestions? I’d prefer someplace a little quieter and no need to live near other foreigners. I’m learning Vietnamese and enjoy getting to know neighbors/the neighborhood.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m a pretty experienced motorbike driver, but before wandering to this side of the world, I did not ask for my international driving permit. I do have valid national driving license for motorcycles of all cc, but legally that is worthless in Vietnam.
 My question is simple: how risky is it if I try to do the Ha Chiang Loop on my own, without an IDP? Are there mandatory checks somewhere? Are they somehow skippable?
 I understand that this is at all NOT recommended, but desperate times call for desperate means. And driving experience is not an issue, really.
 I&#x27;m eager to hear your experience, but I guess it&#x27;s more valuable if you didn&#x27;t take a big group tour. I&#x27;d really prefer doing this on my own.
 Cheers and happy travels!

                              <span>For context, due to multiple issues( weak health, financial burden, etc) I decided to take break for a year and today was the first day I started going to college. However, after a whole day of studying I felt drained? And I have a feeling that applying to college was a huge mistake or something. I&#x27;m think about withdrawing my college tuition fees if this keeps going on in the future.
 I applied to the Diplomatic Acedamy of Vietnam(DAV) by the way. Was it because I took a break for so long that I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to being lazy all day? Or was it something else? DAV is famous for having cut-throat competitive environment so maybe that&#x27;s why? I felt totally intimidated by the environment. Maybe it was a huge mistake applying here. Deep down I have always had the desire to run away from society and become a hermit or a beggar so that I can get this mental turmoil off my head.
 I know some of you might think that I am being childish or immature but really, it got so bad that I quitted everything for a whole year and stayed at home doing nothing but house chores and walking around the neighborhood. Honestly I don&#x27;t know what the fuck is wrong with me anymore. I am thinking of using my remaining savings to... run away somewhere before... committing suicide.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m looking to travel to Vietnam for a 2 week vacation starting in the middle of November. I will be travelling solo, Male 38.
 I like a mix of things when travelling, the most important being: Local food and culture, nightlife (bars), local sporting events, beaches, cultural history, and potentially bringing my golf clubs. I&#x27;ve been looking at staying in Hanoi for a week and then heading to Ha Long Bay.
 I&#x27;ve also been reading about starting in HCMC and making my way up through Da Nang/Hoi An. I&#x27;m not huge into spending days travelling, so was wonder if people have input on HCMC and surrounding areas vs Hanio and surrounding?

                              <span>I came across a post on Facebook about this guy beating his dogs. There is video evidence attached to the post. 
 A rescue team went there and they were told by the owner that they&#x27;ll do as they please with their dogs. 
 Can anyone offer some advice? Or does anyone know someone that can help? 😢

 Anyone know of a company in Da Lat from whom we can rent three motorbike/scooters - something like an Air Blade - and return them somewhere in HCMC? 1 week rental.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Just got to Hanoi from America and I am so impressed with how everyone drives. There don’t appear to be any rules, not sure why an effort was even made to paint lanes, and traffic lights are simply a suggestion. In spite of all of this, everyone seems to navigate the roads in a chaotic harmony. After the initial terror of crossing a street, my wife has embraced the chaos and now takes joy in pointing out the motorbike with six kegs on it or the man somehow carrying an entire workshop on his back. 
 Vietnam is amazing.

                              <span>Or are you not allowed to?
 Last week my dad got hospitalized due to suspision of streptococcus suis contraction. Still to today they havent (or dont) tell him if he actually has it or not or what he actually has regardless of his repeated inquiries and their repeated blood tests.
 Same story early this year, at a different hospital. My mom got a &quot;heart situation&quot; and we called for an ambulance. On the way to the hospital the ER people said it was a myocardial infarction (heart attack). However, the doctorS (stress on plural cause multiple of them reviewed her case and i saw it) said they &quot;dont think&quot; that&#x27;s the case. They suspect it to be a heart failure, &quot;maybe&quot; caused by either hypotension or hypoglycemia. Thats about everything they ever said during an entire week she was there.
 Well, here I am half a year later and still have no clue what actually happened to my mother and how i could prevent it from happening again. Cause they dont tell me or her or my dad. They just said dont worry rest well blah blah. They dont even give us the medical record, just a prescription paper in which it said thats the illness were &quot;related to coronary artery disease and other types of diabetes&quot;.
 So why cant you tell us whats wrong with us? You cant or you&#x27;re not allowed to? Is it a personal thing or a professional thing? Is it a public vs private hospital thing? Or you cant be bothered to talk to us cause you&#x27;re too busy?
 PS: please people in the comments, im really concerned about my parents and them keep being kept in the dark. Im not trying to be smart or condescending or presumptious. If you live in HCMC and know a hospital with high quality transparant service, do tell me.
 Tldr: my parents have been hospitalized on 2 seperate occasions and nobody ever told them what they actually have.

                              <span>Would it be comparable to the Keiretsus of Japan or the Chaebols of Korea in terms of how much influence it has over Vietnamese economy, politics and society? Or is it something more?
 Similarly, is working for VinGroup viewed as prestigious? And finally, are foreigners viewed differently if they are working for VinGroup as opposed to more generic foreigner jobs like being an English teacher or passport bro?

                              <span>When listening to recordings of vietnamese leaders like Nguyễn Phú Trọng, Phạm Minh Chính, Nguyễn Cao Kỳ (went south after 1954) along with older northerners (think those &gt;65 years old), I find that their pronunciation is much less exaggerated than northerners today (youth-mid 40s). The modern northern dialect (Hà Nội standard) sounds very throaty and dense than what the boomers sound like. What exactly happened?

                              <span>Planning to visit Hanoi this December and then going for a bike ride through Ha Giang loop. I&#x27;m guessing it will be quite cold at the time so I wanted to know if there&#x27;s some place in Hanoi where I can rent/buy-sell warm clothes and other gear?
 Just that I didn&#x27;t want to pack these things while coming and increase my luggage resulting in paying extra airline charges. I would be in your debt if there&#x27;s some suggestion on this.
 So basically, I want to buy a jacket in Vietnam, use it and then sell it back in Vietnam itself.
 Had added this as a comment in the pinned thread but didn&#x27;t get any reply so posting.

                              <span>Hello, so i am having my first solo travel in November.
 At the moment I scheduled 25 days in Vietnam. However from viewing different itineraries and youtube videos I was kina turned off by south Vietnam.
 My main priorities are breathtaking nature and sporty/extreme activities, like ziplines, surfing, diving.
 I don&#x27;t care for big cities ,cultural tours, partying and craftsmentship workshops (which i heared there are a lot of in Hoi-an). Originally I was planning to go with my girlfriend, and these activities are fun as a couple, but I just don&#x27;t think I will enjoy them as a solo traveler.
 I have read that north Vietnam&#x27;s nature is amazing and compared to it South Vietnam is underwhelming and has more of the content that i am less inclined towards.
 Therefore I am considering the option of doing about 2 weeks in North Vietnam, focusing on the Loop, The caves, Sapa etc, and then transfering for a short diving/surfing vacation in the phillipins(which excites me but I was originally fine to give up to travel with my ex-gf) . I thought about Thailand as well but i had been there a few years ago. I might be able to add a few days to a week to my trip for that.
 I would love to hear about if someone thinks the plan is feasible / change my mind regarding south Vietnam/ present another option (Cambodia?)
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi everyone, I will be traveling to Vietnam in November and I will mostly stay in the North of Vietnam (Ha Giang, Sapa, Ha Long Bay, Ninh Binh) where the weather will be nice. I love outdoor stuff like hiking and trekking and therefore I would love to visit Phong Nha Ke Bang national park (it looks absolutely stunning!) and do an overnight trekking tour there. However, it seems that the national park is located in central Vietnam where November is part of the raining season. As a result Oxalis is not offering a lot of tours but I found another organization (Jungle Boss) that is offering several tours, even in caves. 
 I’ve been trying to find out how bad it really is in November based on the experiences of other travelers and information on websites, but I’m getting lots of contradictory results. Is it a 100% chance of rain every day and should I be expecting rain all day long? Or should I expect some short (but intense) showers every day and is there also chance to see some sun? 
 Also, when I look up temperatures most websites mention temperatures between 66°F (19°C) to 75°F (24°C), however, on other websites I read that it can get unbearably cold during the night. It’s very confusing as I would not describe 20 degrees Celsius as unbearably cold. 
 I know it would be best to come back to Vietnam for the central part another time, but I don’t think I’ll be back in Vietnam soon as there are so many other places on my travel bucket list as well. And I also know that the weather can’t be predicted but it would be great to hear at least some real experiences from other travelers in November. Not just in Ke Bang national park but experiences from central Vietnam in general will be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all, I am planning a trip to Vietnam + Cambodia for 2 weeks second half of April. Hanoi (w/ Halong Bay + Ninh Binh), Siem Reap + Angkor Wat, and Hoi An. 
 How does the burning season (in N Thailand/Chiang Mai and other parts of SEA) affect Vietnam and Cambodia? I was seeing some pictures of Halong Bay from this past April and it looks super hazy, the skies aren’t blue, which got me wondering. I would like to have good visibility especially for the traveling and cruise and our time in Ninh Binh and Angkor Wat especially. Would love any feedback or thoughts or even a better time to go (I haven’t booked flights yet). Was thinking about pushing it to May but May looks so hot!
 Thank you!!!

                              <span>Being westernized from the States all my life and being Vietnamese American, I have been traveling and living in Ho Chi Minh City for the past 10 plus years. As a local who takes out friends often from different parts of the World, I got tired of telling them to avoid Ben Thanh market and lots of those tourist trap places that bloggers fall for. So after taking out numerous friends out and their friends of friends. I decided to share my experiences and best places in Youtube. I also wanted to capture how the life of a local is living here in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City).

                              <span>I’ve submitted a couple of these and an email with no response.
 I submitted my e-visa application on September 15th, still waiting for it to come back. It still says it’s “processing” My wife and son got theirs back like 5 days ago. We’re in Thailand waiting to go to Vietnam, we’re just about to pull the plug on the trip. It’s weird and a pretty dumb, imo that you can’t submit these as a family so they are processed together.

                              <span>Hi folks, I am looking for a summer English immersion program (for 2024) for a 14 year old nephew, preferably in HCMC. 
 Does anyone have any experience attending any such school for the summer, or any programs of the sort. 
 I see there are some options for international schools with camps and activity components, like AIS and ISHCMC.
 Just wanted to ask the community in the event there were other local programs not showing up on search results that folks can recommend or can share their personal experience of having gone through.

This move would occur 6 days after check-in. He offered us a day&#x27;s price of the condotel rental to compensate. We obliged, and they offered to help us transport our luggage from the old unit to the next unit if we weren&#x27;t available to move it. We agreed as we had arrangements for a tour on the moving day which meant we would not be present for the transfer.

                              <span>Something I&#x27;ve noticed is sharing is HUGE in Vietnamese culture. At first I didn&#x27;t realize why every time I had tortilla chips in the back of the shop, they would always get eaten by the end of the business day. Nobody would ask me to eat my snacks/dinners/etc. This never bugged me but it did always cross my mind when I would go to take my food home and there was no food left! It now appears to me, having been to a recent work banquet, where my co-workers grabbed several smaller bowls and placed different variations of their pho and egg noodles for me to taste. And it doesn&#x27;t stop there, they always offer me to try new things. From desserts with potato to different variations of noodles. I&#x27;m happy to be here, what can I do to express my gratitude?

                              <span>Recently, I traveled to Vietnam and only went to Hue/Hoi An/Da nang. 
 They are all very good cities in central Vietnam. My favorite is Da nang! When you go to Hue, you can see the ancient Hue Imperial City and the famous Temple. You can walk by the river during the day and go to nearby bars to drink and listen to songs at night. It is a very pleasant life.
 The day and night in Hoi An Ancient Town are particularly attractive. Walk around the ancient town during the day, go to a nearby coffee shop for a cup of coffee and some cake. You can also go to the riverside at night, and both sides are very beautiful! There are many famous restaurants nearby! My favorite coffee shop is Mia Coffee. Their cakes are very delicious and the coffee is also great. It should be reminded that Hoi An&#x27;s consumption is higher than that of Hue and even in Da nang, which may be due to tourist cities! What you get with the same money is not worth it! But this is the reason why it is a tourist city. It should be noted that there are some stores that do not indicate the price, and the boss may overpay tourists!
 I mainly went to Monkey Mountain and the Pink Church in Da nang, as well as the Cham Sculpture Museum. If you are interested in Cham culture, you can go and have a look! Very good! You can also go to the holy places of Meishan, which are some historical relics of Hinduism. The night in Da nang is beautiful! There are many lively bars where you can go for a drink. However, I ended up spending time at the Hilton Hotel in Da nang. During the day, I also went to the beach for a drink, ate some snacks, and lay on the beach chair to read. It was very comfortably. The executive lounge of the Hilton Hotel is also very good! You can eat very delicious food at 6 p.m.! There are also bartenders to drink! The staff is great!

                              <span>Sorry for another rant. Almost everyday I have some a**hole behind me with their high beam on. These motorists do not seem to understand that its super glaring and it will literally blind the person in front when they look into the side mirror. They have it on default. Is there a way to solve this peacefully?

                              <span>I just saw the news about a house collapsing in Saigon and I went down a rabbit hole of houses collapsing when the house next to it starts their construction. Just wondering, is the quality of houses good here? what&#x27;s the reason? is it the skills of the construction worker? old houses in general? Can anyone in construction tell me the process? Do you guys do third party auditing?

                              <span>These things happen occasionally and for me it really depends on the circumstance, like whether or not I am in a rush for something.
 What do you guys think? How would you feel about this? Would love to hear your thoughts!

                              <span>I’m struggling to choose. The former is obviously much cheaper and I’m struggling to understand how they do both properly in one day for the latter as they’re both quite far away from Saigon and each other. 
 I’m really into history if that’s relevant and seeing the tunnels is a must.

                              <span>I went to sun world park in da nang last night. I was standing by a roller coaster taking a picture when I noticed something flying past me and I tried to block it out of my way but cannot recall if I touched it or if it touched me. Later on I saw small things flying in the air that looked like bats but not 100% sure if these were bats as they were pretty small. The locals didn’t seem concerned around them at all. Should I get the vaccine. I checked my skin and didn’t notice any scratches or bites and do not recall actually touching it.

                              <span>Hi, I am planning to move to Vietnam for 3 months starting November. I am in my 30s and US citizen.
 Any recommendations where I should stay?
 I like beaches but don’t want a boring or very touristic neighborhood. Somewhere where I can go to gym, cafes, socialize, work a bit and then go to the beach maybe 20-30 minutes away from home.
 I do not mind a warm rain but I don’t want to end up in the most rainy location. I read that rainy season starts in some areas in November.
 Not a party person but I would prefer an active neighborhood where I can meet new people. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I’ve been following this sub for a little while, and seen a few comments before basically saying “bald white men in their 30s are the worst”. I happen to fall into that category perfectly, and I was considering planning a 2 week trip to go sightseeing next year.
 Is the attitude hostile at all, or will people generally be welcoming while I travel? I’ve never been to Vietnam before, so will be good to know what to expect.

 I&#x27;ll be honest that I&#x27;m not sure what much of it was, but I do know that it contained: shrimp, rice noodles, pork belly, and chilli stuffed with mackerel, something crunchy yet chewy, and also two other types of seafood I can&#x27;t identify. 
 I also have no idea what anything in the other bowls are, but they tasted very refreshing - especially with this lovely green bowl of sauce they bought over shortly after.
 I highly recommend!

                              <span>Disclaimer: I genuinely love kids. I don&#x27;t mean to offend anyone by judging the children, but I&#x27;d like to hear your opinion.
 I usually visit certain coffee shops on the weekends to find new inspiration and refresh my mind. I tend to be more creative in such places. Lately, I&#x27;ve been frequenting The Coffee House due to its spacious and comfortable ambiance for working. However, I&#x27;ve encountered some issues with families that bring their children, typically around 3 to 5 years old. These kids never sit still, always yelling and running around without much supervision from their parents. Moreover, the parents in these families tend to speak loudly, trying to overcome the noise created by their children, and sometimes they reprimand their children when they glance at the kids attempting to break something. This results in a significant amount of chaos, which can be quite anxious. It feels more like a kindergarten than a place for adults.
 I want to emphasize once again that I&#x27;m not passing judgment on the children or their parents. However, from my perspective, it appears that the awareness of some individuals nowadays is somewhat lacking, and this could potentially have a negative impact on their children&#x27;s behavior and attitudes (It is actually occurring now)
 Peace.

                              <span>Perhaps anyone can suggest the right way to deal with requests on cancelling bike rides, like Grab, Gojek, etc? 
 I experience these requests repeatedly &quot;cancel, help me&quot;, while the app might say &quot;you will wait for drivers longer now, because you cancel the rides&quot;. Plus any bonus applied to the ride might not be applied the second time.

I know for a fact that the 1pm singer is very talented, and does her best in front of large audiences. 
 I&#x27;d like to encourage all good and groovy people to attend for fun and support of all the song artists that will be attending. 
 Plus, I&#x27;d like to offer ₫100k to the first 10 people to get a selfie with the 1pm dinner after her performance. Just DM me with the pic, and if it&#x27;s her, then I&#x27;ll write the money over.
 Cheers!

                              <span>Is it me or does the alcohol to GDP in Vietnam makes no sense. In HCMC, there cocktails for for 250k (11usd) which is almost the same as prices in the states and as for bottle service it’s about 4.5 mill per bottle ($200usd) I’m wondering how can the locals afford this when their average monthly salary 8-10 mill. Ive been to another 3rd country like colombia which makes total sense $40 usd to $100 a bottle but It makes no sense especially in Saigon. Can someone explain to me?

                              <span>Is getting invited to meet a girl that matched with you on a dating app and her friend who supposedly also likes you normal? Or is it a scam?
 What about girls who will only meet if you go the the bar/club they suggest?
 Can&#x27;t seem to find a girl who just wants to go out on a regular date.

                              <span>A few times now I have been offered to drink beer with older Vietnamese men (&amp; Filipino but doesn’t matter for this post).
 Does this happen to anyone else often? How do you handle it? 
 The first time, I said sure (with family members of my partner). It turned into a multiple hour feast and drink till you pass out on the karaoke mic. The only strange part was no common language the entire time. 
 For this, is why I usually try to turn this opportunity down even though i feel so bad for doing so. I’m all for being invited to have some food, but drinking gets crazy with the Vietnamese haha.

AFAIK this is just a rehearsal as they&#x27;re still fixing the stage area, but damn I&#x27;ve never seen this area crowded like this. Feels like I was in Hoan Kiem.

                              <span>In the 1980s, when Vietnamese Boat People successfully crossed the border, they flooded refugee camps in Southeast Asia. Ms. Ann An Phuong Nguyen (formerly known as Ann Cusack), a teacher in Australia, was just 20 years old at the time. She followed her conscience, leaving her hometown, family and prosperous life. to go to refugee camps to help Vietnamese refugees who have just escaped the country. During 7 consecutive years of volunteer service, she took care of many refugee children and taught English in refugee camps in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. During VHM&#x27;s Gala program on Sunday, September 17, 2023, the Vietnamese Heritage Museum (VHM) was honored to present Ms. Ann Cusack with the VHM Humanitarian Award, as a special way to respectfully acknowledge her love. Her personal love was demonstrated by her tireless and dedicated service to many Boat People during her years of service in Southeast Asian refugee camps.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been visiting Vietnam for a while and I&#x27;ve noticed that on a lot of places, from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh, a lot of people actually live where they work. I&#x27;m not talking about the small family business though - I&#x27;ve seen that in good hotels, restaurants, etc. I&#x27;ve seen workers working during the day and then going to sleep on the business&#x27; basement or on the building&#x27;s last floor. I&#x27;ve accidentally even gone to the basement of some of these hotels and seen someone living there with a kitchen everything.
 Is this common practice? If yes, why? And is it legal?

                              <span>I’ve noticed that lots of Vietnamese American content that shows up on my feed tends to be of a shallower substance. It’s mostly food and comedy about stereotypes, which isn’t inherently bad but…sometimes it leaves me craving more depth.
 I’ve been lucky enough to learn how to play the đàn nguyệt and be exposed to different styles of traditional Vietnamese music. My favorite by far is nhạc cung đình Huế and ca Huế. I’ll never get over how Lưu thủy kim tiền flows or the swaying of Nữ sinh đồng Khánh (I know this is more recent) set to the accompaniment of traditional instruments.
 I really like profiles like this one and it’d be nice to be more exposed to creators that highlight more diverse perspectives on our culture.

                              <span>I am flying to Vietnam from the Philippines in December. It will be a congress sponsored by an international organization. The international organization has ties with governments within Southeast Asia, and I will be officially representing the Philippines.
 However, I also plan to take advantage of the opportunity to experience Vietnamese culture, including the communist/socialist culture.
 Is it permitted to openly display communist/socialist culture in Vietnam? By communist/socialist culture, I mean an overt display of icons connected to communism. For example, am I allowed to wear the military cap with a red star? Am I allowed to pose with Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s monument with my left fist raised?

                              <span>I told my mother that I&#x27;m gay, but ever since I was born I have longed to become a father, nurturing and protecting a child. But instead of going the traditional route of marrying heterosexual, or partnering with a lesbian couple, I wanna do the better thing of adopting a child. 
 Heck, even if I&#x27;m heterosexual I would still choose to adopt a child. There&#x27;s a lot of children needing a home, if you want a child just adopt them, why create for yourself the trouble of having to deal with weddings, the wife&#x27;s family side and stuff. Beside, you have the time to connect to a kid before deciding you could bond with it or not
 But my mother, told me that I&#x27;m crazy and a non blood-related child could never be loyal to me, and always leave me in the end. I told her that I want to father a child not to have someone to take care of me, but to have the feeling that If I were to pass away, I have done something right with my life. I don&#x27;t know how to explain this, but it&#x27;s like I will live my whole life accumulating money, knowledge and experiences, and it would feel like it&#x27;ll be all for nothing if I won&#x27;t spend all of those things on helping and nurturing someone else. It would feel like my all of those things is wasted somehow
 What do your parents and Vietnamese people around think about child adoption? What do you yourself think about it?

                              <span>Me and my gf are at the same age, around 23. She graduated college, i&#x27;m still studying for 2 more years, she wanted to start a family at least by the age of 25. I know i&#x27;m not good enough to take responsible for such a huge commitment ( i&#x27;m not grown up enough ), not at least until i can provide for myself. We had a lot of arguments that i should accept the fact that she might leave me as she wants the best thing for her. Since then, she changed, the way she loved, the way she talked, everything must be exactly what she wants so she can trust that i&#x27;m good enough to be the one for her. Not until a lot of pressures i&#x27;ve been through recently, even when she is one of the biggest pressure feel, now i cant take it anymore, just want to kill myself sometimes. Not even mentioned of the things she wanted me to become when she won&#x27;t accept me for who i am. I cried so much i start losing sleep, losing hairs,... However, she still cares for me, make me feel comfortable and she points out the best in me.
 What should i do when breaking up with my gf is the best thing for both of us but we love each other so much, i know it, i&#x27;m just too selfish to admit that to let her go...

                              <span>I am from the US and visiting my girlfriend who is a local in Vietnam. I am staying at an airbnb. I had read some things about if we are not married that she could not stay with me. But then read it really isn&#x27;t the law anymore, and as long as she is registered, it will not be a problem. I just wanted to confirm this. I asked her but she said she hadn&#x27;t heard of the law (which is making me think if a local hasn&#x27;t it really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal). Any advice would help.

                              <span>So I only got to spend a week there, and I did a lot of typical tourist activities. I&#x27;m American, but I actually went on vacation visiting from China back in 2019. I had been living in Beijing for a year. Beijing is a tier 1 Chinese city, but the vibe is... depressing. People generally look unhappy and stoic, similar to Soviet style culture I suppose. Chinese are inoffensive in customer service, but just... cold. When I landed in Hanoi, which is supposedly the conservative part of Vietnam, the difference was night and day. Interactions with hotel workers, restaurant workers etc was warm and welcoming. English was spoken widely, which again is total opposite of Beijing. What struck me the most was the energy. You could &quot;feel&quot; the progress in the air, like it was an up place where the best is yet to come. I heard China had a similar vibe in the early 2000s. Contrast with China now tho, which by 2019 had already apexed and was showing clear signs of decline. I stayed at a Hilton in the center of Hanoi and it was buzzing with business travelers. Clearly it&#x27;s a growing hub of activity. I also did a junk boat trip in ha long bay, and the guy on the boat was talking about how better life has gotten in just the last 5 years. From the warm locals, to the food (tho I&#x27;ll be honest Hanoi food wasn&#x27;t that great, but the street food was fun and cheap... heard HCM is the place to go for food), the vibe in the air, Vietnam stole my heart and I can&#x27;t wait to return. I&#x27;ve been to well over a dozen countries and lived in 4 continents. I would absolutely love to spend a year or two in Vietnam as it rapidly transforms and grows it&#x27;s presence on the global stage. I wish you all success, I know life isn&#x27;t easy for all, but as someone who&#x27;s &quot;been around the block&quot;, Vietnam is special. Keep doing what you do.

                              <span>Hello, I would like to gather tips on how to be an effective philanthropist in Vietnam. I am an American Việt Kiều. I would prefer to make philantropic decisions based on data and measurable impact. 
 I’ve heard anecdotal information about issues such as pollution, human trafficking, mental illness, etc. What I hope to do is identify where to prioritize my efforts in order to efficiently contribute toward a cause.
 Thank you.
 Ý định của tôi là tạo ra tác động về một vấn đề xã hội. Ai có thể cho lời khuyên về cách tình nguyện và đóng góp hiệu quả không? tôi là việt kiều mỹ. Tôi muốn đưa ra quyết định dựa trên dữ liệu nếu được. Cám ơn.

 I read online that Red-shanked doucs can be seen on the Son Tra peninsula. Is it only place where I can see them or is there some better place? On the Son Tra peninsula, do I need to take tour guide or can I just walk/drive around. Are there some good spots or hiking trails where to watch them?
 I couldn&#x27;t find much information regarding Gibbons. I know about the gibbon treks in Cat Tien but I read mixed reviews about it. Is there some better place where to see them?(preferably in central/ south Vietnam)
 Thank you.

 I bought a simcard (viettel) at the airport like a week ago and received a lot of messages which I ignored because I can’t read vietnamese.
 However this simcard doesn’t work anymore. I went to a smartphone store but they couldn’t help me out.
 Can someone tell me how to proceed in this case?

 This is more of a question of curiosity but could anyone tell me how popular dim sum dishes you&#x27;d typically order are pronounced/spelled in Vietnamese? Thank you!

                              <span>I am an American and do not speak Vietnamese. I am trying to learn as many useful words and phrases as I can before January but it is a very complicated language! My husband and I want to spend a month in Vietnam but are unsure in which city. Hanoi, Da Nang and HCMC all seem like they would be lovely and great places to visit but I am very worried about being able to communicate. Do many people in these cities speak english? Will people be offended by my having to use google translate? Is it possible to travel to the country and manage without speaking Vietnamese ?
 I greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thank you.

                              <span>Basically I work in a restaurant in Hanoi, whenever a customer take a seat, I&#x27;ll ask them how many people they go with, is it one or two
 I noticed a thing that with middle age customers, like 40 years old and above, when they answered &quot;Một&quot;, a lot of them always aspirated the T, like how you say the sound T in English IPA with a burst of air. Like &quot;Một-tuh&quot; 
 Which is weird because as also a Vietnamese, also living in the North, next to Hanoi only 10km, I personally have rarely ever heard any one pronounced words that way. If I say &quot;Một&quot;, I don&#x27;t aspirate the T, only stop it and hold the T behind my front teeth. It doesn&#x27;t come out ever with a burst of air.
 The only person I could recall also talking like that is a coworker of mine whom I used to work with a long time ago. I forgot where he came from but just not a Hanoian and also came from the North, and he always pronounce T in words like that, aspirating with a burst of air. &quot;Biết rồi&quot;, for example, it&#x27;s like &quot;Biết-tuh rồi&quot;
 Is this common way of pronouncing words with T?

Planning to visit all major touristy places. I’m not coming through any tour package, so I wanted to know how difficult it’ll be to find transport between the cities as a tourist.

 Hi everyone, today I&#x27;m going to Prague and I know that there is many Vietnamese people in Czech Republic but I don&#x27;t know how to order in a restaurant. Is it like in the food stall in street in Vietnam? like just say hai Bún bò or maybe you have to follow the local way to do? If so, I don&#x27;t really know how to do in Vietnamese. Also if you happen to know a good Vietnamese restaurant in Prague, let me know :)

                              <span>During the Nanban Trade era between 16th-17th century Japan had a great interest in trading with some Southeast Asian locations due to the Ming attitude toward the sea (the Wokou pirate was a huge issue back then) and the bad relationship between Japan and China during this period.
 However, I checked on the wikipedia and found out Japanese merchants tend to arrive to Dang Trong more than Dang Ngoai for trading even though Japanese merchant ships during this period could extend really far and wide within the Southeast Asian region.
 Was there any major factors behind this?

                              <span>I know a Vietnamese citizen who dropped out of school after grade 5 due to family poverty. They are now an adult and want to get a college degree to unlock more job opportunities. What are their options? Is a High School diploma required for university in Vietnam? Will they need to go back and complete every grade after 5 before they are eligible for university, or is there an equivalent to GEDs in America where they can test out of it? What resources are available for a person in this situation?
 How much time and money should they expect this process to require if they decide to pursue it?

The neighbor never complained to the (foreign) dog owner, just sneakily murdered it. I&#x27;m very confused by this behaviour as I&#x27;ve never heard of it happening in my country except maybe gangsters threatening someone. Can anyone explain the thought process of someone who would do this to their neighbours?

                              <span>Hi,
 Does anyone know how late the ferries run going FROM Cat Ba Island TO Hai Phong? I can only find information going the other way. Or is there a way to get from cat ba island to hai phong in the evening? around 7-8 pm? Can I hire a private boat to bring me in the ferry?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m 22 y.o. game developer from Russia 👋.
 When the war between Russia and Ukraine started, I had to move out. As a remote worker I lived in different countries, but Vietnam is my favourite so I live here already about a year (by visa runs). 
 I really like this country, but my Vietnamese is pretty poor, since I know only about few hundred simple words and phrases. Basic verbs, pronouns, nouns, numbers e.t.c. I planning to stay in Vietnam at least until the end of the war on my homeland. So should I go study Vietnamese courses or something like that? Or it&#x27;s not worth trying since I don&#x27;t work here, and still don&#x27;t have any at least a bit close Vietnamese friends? 
 Maybe it&#x27;s enough just to continue learning passively?

We’d also love to visit unique and vintage shops that sells random displays, decor or accessories. Hoping to get recommendations or any leads here. Thank you!

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I hope everyone is having amazing day so far. So long story short, me and my family with a 2 year old daughter will be visiting Vietnam in October. 
 We thought about the idea of going from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh city and visiting other cities on the cost. I’ve read a lot that it’s not recommended to rent a car and drive without a driver since the roads are dangerous. That said, I would like to know if everyone has done any similar trip with a car,buss or a train( couldn’t find this option). 
 We are thinking to spend around 2 weeks going this route hence why the car idea would be the best without a driver. 
 I would highly appreciate anyone experiences and or any tips how to travel to get the most out of the country.
 Moreover, I’m a professional driver/racer and been driving in a very dangerous places before. Thanks everyone!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 19 year old tourist from The Netherlands, in Vietnam. I&#x27;m here on a 30-day tourist visa that ends on October 5th.
 I have been struggling with mental health issues. I quit my marketing job back home and wanted a break to travel, so I booked flights to Vietnam to be here for roughly a month. I arrived in Hanoi on the 6th of this month, and I&#x27;m still here.
 I&#x27;m enjoying your country. I&#x27;m considering to stay, if it is possible.
 Is it?
 I would want/need to get a job. My talent is marketing (specifically English/Dutch content and SEO), and I speak English fluently, my accent however is bad.
 Besides that, I would of course need the needed documentation, like a work visa. I would need housing as well.
 Is this idea feasible or should I stop thinking about it? I just need some honest feedback from someone who knows how this kind of stuff works. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I will be travelling through Vietnam soon, it will be my second time. 
 I have never driven a motorcycle before, and first time just took grab moto taxis. This time though I am with my girlfriend and so would maybe be interested in using a bike, sometimes, instead of taking separate trips or cars. 
 When in HCMC, we have walking distance all we need, and I would not want to use a bike here anyway. 
 But in a place like Da Lat, or maybe Đà Nẵng, or Huế, I wonder if all things considered it would be a good idea. 
  
I do not want any problems with the police, so I am wondering worst case scenario what is the biggest issue we could have, a fine? Or worse? How likely is a stop anyway, I have been in Asia a lot and always see foreigners riding bikes, some with helmets (as we would) and some without (foolish) and never seen anyone have an issue. But I have heard online of issues. 
 How safe would it even be? I will avoid one hundred percent HCMC/Hanoi, but in quieter places will it be better?
 Realistically how hard is it to drive the bikes? I have ridden quads before, and also bicycles (I’d that’s relevant) 
  
It’s just likely that renting a bike in places like da làt to go see some more far away places would be ideal and cost effective. 
 If it is not a good idea though, we will just have to figure out another plan.

                              <span>It’s not just mimicking the ‘terrible’ accent which annoys me, it’s how they make every aspect of their content around that and it’s supposed to be comedic because it’s ‘relatable’? It’s shared traumatic experience? And what, saying things in a broken accent is supposed to automatically be funny? I used to enjoy some of those skits, but geez for how long are they gonna use the same shtick? Do you have any other jokes to offer other than “Du Maaaaa”?

                              <span>Saw a similar post the other day.
 I’ve been living in the US for 15 years after moving from Vietnam in my teenage years. I thought I assimilated myself pretty well: high school athlete, joined a frat in college, got a mid level management job and just recently got married to my college sweetheart. 
 Everything seems to be going well on paper but living in the suburb in a huge metropolis really starts to take a toll on me: the cost of living is insane, our combined income is well into the upper middle class in our area but it barely feels enough. Walking around downtown seeing all these people living in their high rise apartments and having boats right on the shore makes me feel tiny and insignificant. It’s humbling to put it lightly.
 Similar to most Vietnamese who studied abroad like me,…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m teaching in public schools. It&#x27;s a nightmare. They are so uninterested. They have no respect. Their behavior is truly shocking. 
 I give the rules, like a stuck record before every class. I write them each time on the board. I&#x27;ve been nice, tried to reason with them. I&#x27;ve been a completed troll. I&#x27;ve enforced punishments, like making them stand for the duration of the lesson (now we have been told we are not to punish in anyway as learning English is just an &#x27;extra&#x27; class, not important).
 I&#x27;ve explained that their behavior is unacceptable, and when someone is speaking you listen. Especially a teacher. Right after explaining they turn right around to the person behind them, and start talking or playing Uno.
 Then there is the fighting in class. Last week two boys had a full on punch up in the classroom over who got the answer right. 
 The other day I walked into a classroom, and a boy looked at me and said &#x27;what the fuck is this?&#x27; 
 It&#x27;s a fight from beginning to end. How do you cope?

                              <span>When the Soviet Invade Afghanistan, what was Vietnam reaction, and what news did Vietnam hear from the Soviet Afghan war.
 I hear this a lot how that Soviet Afghan War is the Soviet version of the Amercian Vietnam War. Would you say it a good comparison. While the outcomes are super different because one country (Vietnam) is now stable and very good economy, while the other (Afghanistan) is now being ruled by a radical religion group that terrorize its own citizens. 
 However, both countries commit the worst war crimes in though wars, which cause a lot of political backlashed from the international community and their allies:
 USA in Vietnam: Phoenix Program, Tiger Force, Agent Orange, My Lai massacre, Thạnh Mỹ massacre, Thủy Bồ incident, Rape during the Vietnam War, Incident on Hill 192, Sơn Thắng massacre, Operation Speedy Express, Côn Đảo Prison, Phú Quốc Prison, List of bombing campaigns of the Vietnam War, 1963 South Vietnamese coup d&#x27;état, Gulf of Tonkin incident Lie, Operation Barrel Roll, 1970 Cambodian coup d&#x27;état,
 Causalities: 1,326,494–3,447,494 dead (some sources even claim 5 million people died) 
 Soviet Union: Tajbeg Palace assault, Laghman massacre, Padkhwab-e Shana massacre, Baraki Barak massacre, Kulchabat, Bala Karz and Mushkizi massacre, Kunduz massacre, 1980 student protests in Kabul, Rauzdi massacre, 3 Hoot uprising, Report Soviet troops raped Afghan women, 4 SOVIET DESERTERS TELL OF CRUEL AFGHANISTAN WAR, Chemical Warfare (Moscow&#x27;s Poison War), agriculture destruction (The War In Afghanistan: Soviet Strategy and The State of the Resistance), KHAD, 
 Here a very good video: How The Afghans Defeated The Soviet Union
 Causalities: 562,000–2,000,000 killed (Some sources even claim up to 3 million) 
 with 5 million externally displaced and 2 million internally displaced which make around that Approximately 6.5% to 11.5% of Afghanistan lose it population to the soviets.

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/16nsoca/an_unorthodox_request_thoughtsadvice_on_finding_a/">

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for Vietnamese-speaking local guide (English NOT required) I speak Vietnamese semi-fluently and can 100% understand Vietnamese when spoken with a southern accent (I struggle a bit more with Northern and Hue accents but can probably manage. I can read very poorly but could get by if it was a life or death situation). What would be a good way to find a local guide who can dedicate 2-4 weeks to showing me around the entire country? 
 I feel this would be a good opportunity for a recent grad who wants to practice English (with someone who is fluent in both English and Vietnamese) and to go on a free vacation (with modest base pay ~$500USD for one month and basic essentials like food, lodging, etc.) covered. I would also prefer it if they are a woman (because I am female and would feel more comfortable with another woman) who knows how to drive a car/motorbike and who has experience traveling in VN. Am I being unreasonable/ too demanding?
 If it isn&#x27;t clear, I am asking here because I feel most of the options I see are group tours geared towards tourists who have 0 understanding of Vietnamese language and culture and rely purely on English-speaking guides and tours. I don&#x27;t really want to do these tours because they seem waay overpriced and limit what you can see or do based on availability of English-speakers. They also seem to cater to a western audience and I am not interested in that.

                              <span>I&#x27;m 26yo, and I recently visited Vietnam for the 2nd year in a row and this time for 4 months (3 visa runs). I&#x27;m now back in my home country and I&#x27;m really interested in living in Vietnam long term. I&#x27;ve looked at the visa options and job opportunities and I don&#x27;t have a degree so the visa option I&#x27;m most interested in is the Investor Visa, invest 130k usd into an existing business in Vietnam or I can open a franchise like 7/11, GS25, Family Mart etc. I would not have to run it but it would be an Absentee Owner business, which I&#x27;ve read is very common in Vietnam and then I could get a 1 year Investor visa which can be renewed 5 times (5 years). It would be something for 2-3 years from now, so I can increase my income potential to be able to have the capital to be a foreign investor.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving there after the next Tet holiday. Until then I have to save some money. 
 I don&#x27;t have any college degree, probably just making some minimum wage. The only reason I wanna move is because I&#x27;m gay and the gay community is much larger there. I feel like I belong there instead of Hanoi where I&#x27;m living right now because of that
 But I have no specialized skill, with little money, which district is cheaper to live in Saigon?

                              <span>I have been working in Vietnam for 4 years. And I always find it baffling how I am treated by Vietnamese employers, am I the only one? 1. Many don’t like face to face confrontation or honest conversations… 2. Many never tell the truth, but always go around in circles to lie and you have to decipher what is true and what isn’t. 3. Never straightforward and honest. 4. Always the last person to find out anything even when it’s been planned for weeks, you will get told on the day or the day before or not Al all.

 I’ve had all sorts of drinks and ice from nice cafes and restaurants to bars and random off street hawkers with no major issue so far. 
 Do I have a reason to feel smug about having a strong stomach or have I just been lucky?

                              <span>So i work for a VNese company remotely, all was fine until a Hanoi-an guy joined the team.
 That guy has such bossy attitude and acts like the manager, he is younger but act like he is more experienced and like my all years of experience is nothing.
 We had a Hanoi-an lady work with us too, seemed not friendly or helpful at all. I thought maybe its a female thing.
 Lately i have noticed Hanoians have some major issue with southern and expats. He has the mindset hanoi team is far better , i mean fuck you bro, i taught you soo much as mentor and you act like this.
 I am even an year older than him, i always thought VN respect elders
 I told the guy to F-off, as an expat remote female employee i was very shocked and hurt by his behavior.
 Strange jealousy or acting like no one is better than him.
 So are Northern very cold towards expats? Its my bad luck, i met the wrong one 😔 😭

                              <span>Just generally wondering as a foreigner if it’s common across most Vietnamese.
 I started a small food business just recently and even as a foreigner of Chinese descent (not buddhist or taoist though), I feel some Vietnamese people seem to take superstitions quite seriously, some of which is trying to say if something “unlucky” happens, it is a good sign for something lucky to come.
 Some examples: 1. Hitting the table or something metallic hardly - will bring in customers 2. Accidentally breaking glass - good sign for attracting customers 3. Raining on opening day (especially if it’s right after you done opening day prayers) - business will flourish
 What are some others you have heard?

                              <span>I got into a scuffle the other day with a guard demanding 20k VND tip for supposedly &quot;guarding&quot; my car.
 Just a quick run through, I parked my car in front of an abandoned empty lot on a quiet Sunday morning and had this guard running from the opposite street (not even opposite, more like a few shops down from directly opposite my car), trying to squeeze in a &quot;service&quot; of opening my car door for me. This same dude then demanded 20K VND as &quot;tip&quot; or &quot;fee&quot; for helping me guard my car. I of course said no because I didn&#x27;t think he deserved it or that he actually owned that spot. He then proceeded to knock heavily on my window and shouted &quot;I watched your car for you, so the fee is 20k!&quot; - Translated by my Vietnamese girlfriend.
 Keep in mind that I&#x27;m not a fan of tipping , and if I must, I believe a tip should be reserved for those who actually deserve it, not a random guy sitting by the corner of the street insisting that he did me a service, like I can&#x27;t open my own car door. Do you guys think this expectation has been terribly manifested by the tipping culture from overseas, and has now deemed as appropriate? or am I just a bad person? Also, not sure why bikes aren&#x27;t subjected to tips but only cars? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all!
 I’m an American currently on a long term travel adventure and I’ve been bouncing all around Europe for a couple of months. I’m planning to head to Vietnam for the first time in a few weeks and I’m looking for a place where I can chill out for a while and truly get to know the culture and people.
 My research has pointed me at Hoi An, but I know it’s quite touristy. That’s ok, as long as I can see some culture as well.
 Some thoughts about what I’m looking for:
  
Smaller city or town is preferred. I’ve been in the massive cities in Europe and I’m ready for a slower pace for a while.
 I speak absolutely no Vietnamese. I have no qualms about using google translate, but I want to visit a place where that wouldn’t be viewed as a negative thing. In other words, someplace tourist friendly, even if it isn’t touristy.
 I tend to love seeing museums and historical sites when I travel, so someplace where at least some of that is available.
 I’m not a digital nomad, but decent internet so I can keep in touch with family and friends would be nice.
 Near a beach, even for day trips would be cool, but in no way a requirement.
  
Any suggestions? Is someplace like Hoi An/Da Nang my best option?
 I appreciate any help or tips!

                              <span>I am of Vietnamese origin but I have been living abroad in Europe. I am currently in Vietnam for three weeks visiting my relatives. 
 The richer part of my family living in Vietnam really wants me to move back to Vietnam and tries to find all ways possible to persuade me, one of the being the rapid improvement of life and presence of many money-making opportunities thanks to the growing economy. 
 It is true that in the last year or two I have ocassionally seen and heard some news about Vietnam&#x27;s rapid development and its increasing direct foreign investment from other countries. The successful relatives really talk nice about the local life and how much better it is from Europe. They have showed me some of the nice places for richer people (I guess only really expensive for locals but affordable for foreigners). 
 Visiting Vietnam I have also seen myself that there has been improvement in Vietnamese infrastructure and services for example. However, I cannot really judge the real situation based on a three-week holiday, neither can I fully rely on my relative&#x27;s point of view since they don&#x27;t have the full knowledge of Europe either and their opinions might be biased.
 I need to have an objective perspective to compare it since I am biased too. How does a real life look like in Vietnam for a (upper) middle class? How would you rate your curent situation, would you move abroad if you could? How good are the international opportunities? As local, what are the things you like and dislike about the Vietnam compared to other countries?

 According to one of my cousins who has went through middle and highschool though, it is said that they fight… alot. Is this true? and just how brutal are these fights? Like is it just one on one wrestling or full blown gang brawls? I want numbers so I’ll just put a poll up

                              <span>Xin chào! I apologize that I&#x27;m not fluent in Vietnamese, so this post will mainly be in English.
 My mother was born and raised in Vietnam, but immigrated to the US and had me there.
 Today we saw a praying mantis, and my mother talked about how when she grew up in Vietnam, the older people in her town would chew betel nut and put the paste on praying mantises. She mentioned the reasoning behind this practice as that the older people think the praying mantis likes it too.
 This was very surprising and confusing for me, and I tried searching in Google (in English) about this custom. I can find plenty of sources about betel nut chewing in Vietnam, but nothing in particular about putting the paste on praying mantises.
 I don&#x27;t think my mother was joking when she mentioned this, but I just want to hear some verification from other Vietnamese people about this custom. For additional context, she grew up in Phan Rang in Ninh Thuận.

                              <span>I’ve lived in Hanoi for over a year now, I’m going back to England for Christmas this time. I’d like to surprise my loved ones with gifts from Vietnam, what gifts would you recommend? It would be best if they are easily portable, good value and quality, targeted at either gender. Also, the whole point is that the gifts will be authentic and can only be found in Asia. 
 I’ve always struggled to think of Christmas gifts that are different and surprising. I know sometimes it’s best to just buy the more expensive option and call it a day. But I think this year I would like to give out multiple smaller gifts to bring a variety. I’ve got a few ideas but I’m wondering what other people would think of too. Thanks for all the help :))

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m currently exploring the possibility of manufacturing silicone/tpe based products, and I was wondering if any of you might have some insights or recommendations. I want to emphasize that I&#x27;m looking for legitimate manufacturers.
 Here are some specific details about what I&#x27;m looking for:
  
Tooling: We plan to supply our own tooling, so manufacturers who can work with provided molds and specifications would be ideal. However, we&#x27;re also open to exploring the costs of having tooling made in Vietnam if it makes economic sense.
 Manufacturing Location: While we&#x27;re open to manufacturers outside Vietnam, we&#x27;re particularly interested in understanding the manufacturing landscape within Vietnam itself. If you have knowledge about manufacturers in Vietnam or can recommend any reputable companies, please share your insights.
 Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Our initial requirement is a minimum order quantity of 400 units. If you know of manufacturers that can accommodate this quantity or provide competitive pricing at this scale, we&#x27;d greatly appreciate your suggestions.
 Packaging: We plan to handle the packaging ourselves, so manufacturers who can provide the product without packaging would be preferred.
  
Please keep in mind that this inquiry is for legitimate purposes, and I&#x27;m looking for advice on how to approach this inquiry in a responsible manner.
 Feel free to reply here or send me a private message if you prefer to share information privately. I can also explicitly share images of our products as well. I will also be asking you to provide examples of your work.
 Thank you in advance!
 Best.

Can I safely park it on the side of small street between buildings with locked steering and U lock on back wheel for few hours during the day? Just I don&#x27;t want it to get stolen and my VN gf claims that they will steal it 100% (I don&#x27;t trust her VN knowledge, so I&#x27;m asking here😉)

                              <span>I am an average tourist who knew little about vietnam. Coming from a family of die hard communist supporters in India. Read a lot about vietnam war. In fact , its a big reason why I am in Vietnam now. I know life during vacation is different than the actual daily life. But here in this country, I coul relate myself to the people. It&#x27;s not an alien country where everything looks so different. Here I see problems in daily life. I see 5 yr old little girls selling something on the bui vien street. This is heartbreaking. But that&#x27;s the truth. I saw crazy traffic and pollution. Couple of accidents in HCM. Well, feels like India to me. The war museum was absolutely wonderful, shocking, terrifying.

                              <span>This is probably controversial but f it. I’m (31F) solo traveling throughout Vietnam now. First I went to see family in HCM, then I began my solo journey to Hoi An and Da Nang. No issues in either place. but I’ve been in Hanoi since Saturday and walking around I’m noticing a lot of harassment from south Asian tourists . Yesterday I was in Ha Long Bay at the beach and this guy started taking photos of me. Then he came up to me and asked if he could take photos with me, I said no. Another tourist came banging on my hotel door last night on the cruise which scared the crap out of me. I told him to go away. Today I’m back in Hanoi just walking around in the old quarter and a group of them started to stare at me like I was prey. I quickly grabbed my dinner and went back to my hotel.
 I have no issues with south Asians, I have a lot of South Asian friends in the states and also work with them. They are the kindest people. They do not act like this. I just never experienced harassment from like this and it’s kind of bummer it’s happening IN Vietnam. I’m terrified to go out alone now and will probably being taking Grab everywhere for the duration of my stay even if it’s less than 10 minutes away

                              <span>I was born and raised in Vietnam, moved to the states when I was 13. I’m now in my late 20s and have a full time remote job with good pay/benefits. I went back to vietnam about a week ago to attend my cousins weddings and have had so much fun. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m on vacation but I’ve seen Vietnamese people way more relax and not uptight like Americans. Breakfast and cafe in the morning will thousands of options, my cousin here in Vietnam is a freelance video editor and he works whenever and wherever he wants, around noon all the vendors close for a nap time, and at night eat out (again with thousands of options).
 Meanwhile, I work 9-5 in the states with 30mins lunch time but sometimes I eat at my desk. After work, I have to go to the grocery stores or the gym and sometimes too tired to even cook. Weekends I have to do chores and again grocery. It just feels like time is shorter in the states.
 Everything is getting more expensive in the states so my 75k a year salary doesn’t seem much. My fiancé is a teacher so her job is pretty demanding too. 
 I just feel like people in Vietnam just have more what we call ‘freedom’ the U.S has been advertising. I’ve been considering moving back to vietnam for the past few days if I can work remote and my fiancé can teach English but my parents have properties in the states and they have sacrificed so much so I can have the “best” life in America…just some thoughts
 Edit: just to clarify since some people are triggered because I use the word “freedom” what I meant is it just seem that the lifestyle and work style in Vietnam is more relax compared to America but I do understand that I’m here on vacation so people take off work to hang with me

But when I do get given a ticket, It often has &#x27;tay&#x27; written on it. I realised that means westerner, but what&#x27;s all the fuss about? Why am I not treated the same as the locals?

                              <span>Was opening time and initially someone wouldn&#x27;t let me in I showed them the time and so collegue let me in reluctantly.
 Then I walked around the corner and there was about 30 staff lined up on opposite sides of aisle.
 Then I had to walk through them.
 Then they all clapped and bowed
 Does this happen every morning ? Is it an opening morning thing ?

                              <span>My family is Vietnamese, but both my grandparents and parents grew up in France or New Zealand. I was born and grew up in New Zealand. I’ve been to Vietnam before, and even though I can speak to my family, no one in Vietnam could really understand me and kinda mocked me, haha. I want to travel solo to Vietnam but am concerned about making friends. 1. I don’t speak Vietnamese, so it might be hard to make Vietnamese friends. 2. I don’t look like a foreigner, so it might be hard to make foreigner friends. So I’m just looking for tips and advice on meeting people both local and foreigner. TIA

                              <span>I looked online and the only source I could find on the topic was from Quora. They mentioned that the offers are from Grab’s allotted budget for promotions and therefore Grab drivers receive the same amount regardless of discounts applied.
 However, when I booked a Grab ride with the discount, the driver mentioned that he didn’t realize it was a discounted ride and now he’ll receive less than he initially expected. He said that discounted rides means he gets paid less.
 So, how do payments work for discounted rides? I was under the assumption of the first scenario which was why I used offers in the first place.

                              <span>I&#x27;m living in Hanoi, owning a 50cc Cub. I notice that Halong is only 150km away from me, and it&#x27;s possible to drive there my own. I want to take a short trip to relieve some stress
 But my friends told me that it&#x27;s illegal to use such a weak-engine bike to use on highways, that by law 50cc bikes are not allowed on them. And I&#x27;m pretty sure in order to get to Ha Long, I have to be one some highways. Is it illegal to use them on highways? 
 Or is it even possible to go that far with them, since my bike allows only to drive 50 km/h max. It might take long, and my bike might break down if driven at the maximum limit speed for long hours

                              <span>Hey all! I&#x27;m new to this subreddit so pardon me for not knowing how to approach this subject but.. my 19 year old cousin has been alone in Vietnam for a little over a year now. Her final parent, my aunt died a little over a year ago. She&#x27;s a native citizen from Vietnam. I was wondering if my family has any options of bringing her over to the US to live with us? If this is possible I was hoping someone might know the process and the steps required as she is family and we don&#x27;t want her by herself in Vietnam.

                              <span>So! It&#x27;s officially been one month since I moved to Vietnam from America. So far, I&#x27;m really liking the country- even though I know I have plenty of room to grow and get to know it better. Given this, I wanted to ask some more trivial questions and provide some general comments as an adjusting newcomer.
  
Are measuring cups in cooking not a thing here? None of the stores I&#x27;ve found that have kitchen appliances carry them- even the more specialized ones at Aeon Mall.
 Having witnessed the car-clogged streets of Manhattan, I find the constant flow of motorbikes pretty refreshing (even if I&#x27;m terrified to ride one in Ho Chi Minh City).
 I&#x27;ve visited a few Buddhist temples and seen some shrines around, and they often have food in them like apples, kumquats, etc. Is this food for anyone, or does it serve a specific purpose? I don&#x27;t want to take when I&#x27;m not supposed to. EDIT: Answered! I will not take that food.
 I&#x27;m still bemused by how frequently I see Lotso Bear. He seems to be pretty popular independent of Toy Story, and I&#x27;m not quite sure why.
 I hear that avoiding eye contact is generally used when Vietnamese people are frustrated, since they want to avoid direct confrontation. I&#x27;ve always struggled with eye contact (I&#x27;m on the autism spectrum), so would Vietnamese people read that as a sign of anger or hostility?
  
God knows, I have plenty more thoughts, but I&#x27;ve worked through a lot of those with some of my friends. Thank you in advance for your input. I&#x27;m happy to be here.

                              <span>Im currently in Hanoi with my vietnamese GF. Were from Germany and are here for 5 days before we leave for South Korea, then Japan and after that to Saigon.
 My gf wants to go to Phu Quoc as she really wants to be at a nice beach whereas i want to go to Bangkok as the weather is way too hot and humid for me to enjoy it in Phu Quoc and i would stay mostly inside in Bangkok. Also i heard from alot of friends and people living in Vietnam that Phu Quoc will be 50% rain at the time we would go there (16th Oct). Also i think the remaining time we have would be too long for a trip to phu quoc (1 Week).
 What would you guys recommend? Is there maybe a nice beach not too far from Bangkok?
 Thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>Mình có một anh bạn trai kém tuổi. Tụi mình yêu nhau đã được 1 năm, thời gian yêu nhau mình biết ảnh không có kinh tế nên hỗ trợ ảnh rất nhiều. Cụ thể là tiền thuê nhà, chi phí sinh hoạt, ăn uống hàng ngày mình đều lo cho ảnh mỗi ngày kể từ khi yêu nhau. Ảnh thì đi xin việc ở đâu cũng bị từ chối do có hình xăm nên tính ra từ khi mới yêu ảnh mới đi làm khoảng 3 tháng (không liền nhau). Thời gian còn lại lúc nào cũng kè kè bên mình. Mình luôn động viên ảnh và chỉ yêu cầu ảnh hỗ trợ mình làm 1 vài việc chân tay. Ảnh có cơ thể khá yếu nên hay kêu mệt mỏi với mình, nhiều lúc ốm mình cũng đưa ảnh đi viện để truyền và mua thuốc cho ảnh. Thật sự với mình như vậy là mình quá cảm thông cho ảnh rồi. Nhưng cho đến hôm trước mình như tức nước vỡ bờ. Ảnh mới kiếm được 1 công việc phục vụ 5 tiếng 1 ngày thì tối ảnh tan ca qua đón mình. Đó là ngày thứ 3 anh đi làm. Như mọi hôm mình đưa anh qua cửa hàng tiện lợi mua mì và nước cho ảnh hồi sức. Sau đó bọn mình có chơi game 1 lúc rồi lại về nhà mình ăn cơm và xem phim, sau đó mình cũng gọi nước sinh tố về cho anh bồi bổ. Ăn xong mình chỉ nhờ ảnh rửa bát, lúc mình bảo thì ảnh không nói gì với mình mà cứ lẳng lặng đi làm. Nhưng lúc rửa bát thì ảnh bắt đầu khó chịu với mình và nói mình không biết thông cảm cho anh đi làm cả ngày mệt và tụi mình cãi nhau. Ảnh nói từ nay ảnh không qua ăn cơm là được nhưng suốt 1 năm qua ngày nào ảnh cũng qua ăn. Mình biết tiền không phải thước đo nhưng để làm ra tiền thì mình cũng phải mất công sức và trí tuệ nên với mình đó là tấm lòng của mình. Như vậy là mình chưa thông cảm cho ảnh phải không?

                              <span>I had a fun conversation with a Vietnamese friend regarding Vietnamese swears. We gone through most of everything. But they kept teasing me about this one word that they refuse to tell me for months, no matter how much I begged.
 They told me it’s so bad they will never teach it to me. It’s apparently a really old slang and you need to be local local to know, hard to find on Google as well, It’s just as bad if not worse than N-word with hard r. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY’RE REFERRING TO?
 Update: It&#x27;s an old slang for natives, it&#x27;s used for females specifically. &quot;Lẹo cái&quot; seems to be the closest one but it&#x27;s not complete. It&#x27;s a banned word on google, my friend&#x27;s only seen one text that had it written but it&#x27;s been banned since. And that this generation might not know it.

                              <span>I want to find a Vietnamese song I listen to during my childhood. If you could even point me towards the artist that would be really helpful. I listen to this song back in like 2009 so this song was either created in 2009 or even before. But in the song there was like 3 guy(don’t know if they were brothers or friends) but they were flirting with this one girl. I guess it’s kind of like a love song but more gear towards a younger audience. I remember in the music video the artist rode a bike 😂. Finally the 3 guys made a lot of songs together. Don’t know if they were individual artist working together or they were an actual music group that only made music together. Also it was a pretty common/popular group I believe.

I’m then planning to rent one there and drive up to Hanoi during 10 days. I know there are companies who do one-way rental for the Hai Van Pass but are there any that do the same until Hanoi?

 Can someone explain what these studios include? Or do I️ need to hire makeup, bring clothes, and everything else separately?
 Any advice is welcome!

I’m 20 so I’m not sure how common it is for people in Vietnam to start dating but I’m from Europe so I’m busy studying etc.

                              <span>Hello, I was watching a soccer game this evening, and I noticed something concerning. The commentator, who is also a host for this streaming service, had around 250k people watching live. In the chat section, a user named &quot;Bắn Hoả Tiễn&quot; said something inappropriate, and in response, the commentator displayed the message &quot;Bắn Hoả Tiễn is a dog&quot; on the screen for all 250k viewers to see. I&#x27;m wondering why some individuals still resort to comparing others to dogs as a means of humiliating those they dislike?

                              <span>Why would my Vn sister-in-law do this?
 And her behaviour is really pissing me off.
 SIL asked if I wanted Ca Phe Sua Da?
 &quot;Good idea&quot;.
 She buys 2 x Ca Phe Sua Da&#x27;s. 1 for me. 1 for her. 
 I did not offer to pay. She has good job by Vn standards. Maybe that was a mistake on my side?
 But be aware I am the main banker whenever any family get-togethers occur. I pay. And they ignore me. Situation normal.
 So it felt an improvement when member of family actually thinking about me!
 I liked my Ca Phe Sua Da so much I decide to buy another one.
 I ask my SIL if she would like another Ca Phe Sua Da?
 &quot;No&quot;.
 So I order 2 more Ca Phe Sua Da&#x27;s. 1 for me and 1 for BF of SIL. ( I&#x27;m thinking of others am I not? He had no idea).
 I ask my SIL how much did the Ca Phe Sua Da man charge?
 &quot;VND15k each. So VND30k&quot;.
 I give the guy VND30k. 
 This is where I was caught by surprise.......
 The Ca Phe Sua Da man obviously thought I had given him too much and went to put his hand in his pocket trying to say ( my Viet ain&#x27;t so hot) VND25k.
 I was surprised because SIL had been very clear I would need pay VND30k.
 The amount of money is not the issue.
 What is the issue is SIL then speaks to the guy in Tieng Viet and tells him &quot; Just take the VND30k. No need for change&quot;.
 She did not look at me. In fact she was looking away from me and the guy and at her mobile as if I would not hear and would not understand.
 He took his hand out of his pocket and tried to thank somebody and was not too sure who to look at; me or SIL. 
 So he kept his VND30k. 
 And why not! It was a very good Ca Phe Sua Da!
 The question I have is why SIL felt it necessary for foreign BIL to pay more than she did?
 Members of family frequently try to stiff me - i get the feeling they think I&#x27;m stoopid because I&#x27;m a foreigner and do not speak Tieng Viet and must therefore pay for them AND pay more.
 Hardly the behaviour of a loving family.
 What is driving this behaviour?

                              <span>I told this story once in r/Vozforum but they deleted it for no reason,
 My relationship with my mother is getting worse and worse everyday. She&#x27;s demanding that I give her half of my salary, my salary is only 6 mil. She said that she&#x27;s getting old and sick and as a child I have to give her my money,
 I refused, telling her at this age I need money for my goal and personal growth. And she kept guilt-tripping me telling she will get old and sick, I&#x27;m so fed up I told her that
 &quot;You kept telling me that you&#x27;re getting old and sick, but ever since the day you came back, what has you done for my health? Has you saved at least one penny in case my health would go bad?&quot;
 I should&#x27;ve moved out earlier, it&#x27;s just a part of me naively thinking that she and I could mend it back

                              <span>I&#x27;m living in Hanoi, having grown up in Bac Ninh. I heard that most people use &quot;Mày&quot;, and &quot;Tao&quot; to refer to their friends and themselves to their friends, as it&#x27;s an sign of being intimate and close and comfortable enough with them
 I personally don&#x27;t like those two pronouns and don&#x27;t use them much often, I think it could come out quite harsh some times, there&#x27;s a reason most people don&#x27;t use it with strangers. But there&#x27;re people in the North assume it&#x27;s the default way to call people no matter how close or distant you are, and I hate them so much, it sounds so rude if you and I aren&#x27;t that close
 With my best friends and friends, I use their personal names/tôi or tao if extremely close. Ông/Tôi and Personal names/Personal names. 
 The rare cases I use &quot;Mày&quot; and &quot;Tao&quot; with my friends are when I&#x27;m trying to make a comedy skit or purpousfully acting theatrically with them.

Tuy nhiên sau 2 năm và hiện tại khi mình và cô ấy đang lớp 12 và cô ấy nói không còn cảm xúc với mình nữa và dần cảm thấy chán mình , mình nhắn thì cô ấy chỉ vào rep ngắn rồi lại mất tiêu rồi một lúc lại vào rep , mình hẹn gặp nhau thì cô ấy bảo bận nhưng mình cảm giác cô ấy không cố gắng gặp mình nữa . Mình không nghĩ là 2 năm cố gắng mà bây giờ cô ấy lại trở nên vậy , có cách nào giải quyết khiến kí ức hồi xưa trở về khiến cả 2 trân trọng nhau hơn không ạ?

                              <span>My 3rd time making phở gà. The top bowl has bean sprouts, jalapeños, lime, and green onions. I didn’t have a serving bowl large enough for all my noodles and broth so I just filled the red bowl up twice. I’m happy with how it tasted but trying to make the portions right is hard for me with the amount of broth/noodles for just 1 person. Anyway thanks for this dish Vietnam. Warm regards from Arizona, USA!

 Let me start by saying that I am asking this question to gain knowledge and understanding and not to attract trolls or to troll. (Although this kind of topic will inevitably do that) I am a foreigner who has lived in Viet Nam for around 4 years and currently work as an English teacher at a language center.
 I have noticed that SOME of my teenage students seem to celebrate and venerate the Nazi regime and Hitler himself, with some of them showing me Nazi salutes in what I assume is &quot;humor&quot;, one student has played the Nazi anthem on his phone (I didn&#x27;t know what it was until he told me) and placed his hand on his heart, and some of my students have told me that they look up to him and have proudly told me things like &quot;I&#x27;m the biggest racist&quot;.

We&#x27;ve been in Bali for a week and last night we arrived in Da Nang (EDIT: sorry, we&#x27;re actually in Hoi An, we flew into Da Nang! Arrived very late, so I wasn&#x27;t sure!) and we&#x27;re here until Saturday. Haven&#x27;t had time to make too many plans yet.
 We love history, architecture, FOOD and wonderful people. 
 We don&#x27;t have a car, so will get taxis etc.
 Please help us make an itinerary.
 Thank you 💞

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I will be traveling to vietnam in march for 20 days. I want to prepare my itinerary in advance which means booking transportation. Which website is the best and most legit to book tickets (mostly train) and also allows to chose which berths i would like? Also; how much in advance should i book them? Any recommendation on where to rent a bike in da nang and ninh binh? Are peony cruises worth the price for an overnight &quot;cruise&quot;? 
 Thank you

                              <span>Me and my wife are planning a 10 day trip to Vietnam in the first 2 weeks on November 2023. We will be starting from Hanoi and then flying back from Ho Chi Minh.
 I have been reading inconclusive information about visiting Hoi An in November. Can anyone advise whether it would be wise to avoid visiting Hoi An during November or is it OK?
 Am so excited about this trip!

                              <span>Well, I was learning to drive a bike last year. Generally speaking, I was able to use it. But there was a strong fear that I could kill someone. And that fear paralysed me ultimately, so I have never driven outside parkings :)))) That’s why, generally speaking, I can’t use a bike. Plz recommend the instructor who knows how to work it out and can do that (and teach driving skills for sure :). 
 Humor (much humor) is a great tool that helped me, for example, overcome the same thing in surfing.
 Thanks.
 P.S. I have relevant driver license :D

                              <span>Hi Vietnamese,
 I am a Thai girl who is interested in living in Vietnam.
 The main reason is that I love Vpop and want to learn more about Vietnamese culture. I am obsessed with some big names: Son Tun Mtp, Low G, Quang Hung masterD, Amee, Tlinh, Hoang Thuy Linh,….
 Do you know Vpop is becoming more popular in Thailand? A Vietnamese guy introduced these songs to me ☺️
 There’re many reasons I want to explore Vietnam. Youth is too short to settle down.😎
 I know there is a big difference between north and south parts. My friend says HCM’s vibe is similar to Bangkok, so I choose Hanoi. I want something different. My friend will be in Hanoi soon, so he may help me a lot. And I have at least one person to hang out with
 My main concern is job hunting in Vietnam. I want to work in person with local people, so I can make friends.
 I am living in Montreal, Canada now. I studied abroad here and got a full time job, so I have work experience
 I have a degree in graphics design and diploma in photography. 
 How’s graphics design and photography industries in Vietnam? Any chance for me to get a job at a big studios or simply work as freelancer. I want to work for a professional one. I may send portfolio to potential employers.
 My other option is teaching. I took IELTS exam 2 months ago. My overall band is 7.5. Not bad, but not good enough to be English teacher.
 I have c2 in French and have lived in French speaking environment for a long time. I am thai, but my ancestors are Chinese and British, and I can speak some mandarin. I am thinking about being a French or Thai teacher.
 Do many local people want to learn French or Thai?
 Any suggestions to adapt environment in positive way, job hunting, housing and socializing?
 How do vietnamese think about Thai in general, esp female? I know some stereotypes exist
 I accidentally found this forum while googling “work in Vietnam”. Really want to get some insightful information from you guys.

                              <span>my parents were part of the boat refugees in ‘75 and i believe they both renounced their citizenship in order to get US naturalization. i was born in wisconsin but i would like to live in VN at some point and learn more about the language and culture. the us allows dual citizenship but i don’t know if the vn government does, nor if it would even be possible for me since my parents no longer are vn citizens. does anyone know if it’s possible in such cases to get citizenship (maybe after living or working there on a visa or something) or if it’s basically impossible?

 So I&#x27;ve recently been looking up vietnamese Internet cultures and memes and whatnot and I found this video titled &quot;vinacon bị gank&quot; and I wondering if anyone could translate or give some context as to what happens in the video? And maybe give some recommendation of chill vietnamese content creators.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been wondering about this for a while now...it&#x27;s late 2023, covid will never be totally gone but much of the world has gotten vaccinated and moved on as the severity of the virus has decreased. 
 I don&#x27;t see too many folks on the streets masking these days, but for some reason it seems really common in high schools - I teach IELTS in high schools in Hanoi, and am surprised that sometimes up to half of my students are still masking. I wonder what the reason is - are they really doing it for health protocol? I can&#x27;t imagine teenagers are particularly worried about getting sick at this point right? Do their parents make them? My theory is that a lot of young people wear them because it helps self-conscious teens feel &quot;covered&quot; and secured a little bit. 
 I&#x27;m not an anti-masker, these guys can do what they want - just curious why it seems so much more prevalent than in other countries (to be clear, I&#x27;m talking about students in a classroom wearing it year-long, not wearing it on the road or because they&#x27;re sick.)

                              <span>So I admit that this probably annoys me more than most people but in Vietnam even when I travel by day I am in a sleeper bus.
 It&#x27;s kinda uncomfortable for me to do this. I like to sit up straight and look at the view outside. I don&#x27;t want to lie down during the day.
 Maybe I am going wrong by booking the bus through the hostel? Should i go to the local bus station instead and find a sitting bus?
 Edit: I&#x27;m an idiot and actually found out how to put the seat up now so this improves my mood dramatically lol

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m just beginning to develop my idea of tote bags (felt, canvas, structured and also casual shopping bags) after I got compliments and inquiries on where I got a special tote bag when I visited Vietnam this year.
 I wanted to do some market research to figure out what kind of designs appeal to the public - generally, Vietnamese-Americans and Vietnamese-Canadians but also anyone interested in a small fashion startup with a Vietnamese twist on it.
 Please let me know what sayings on the products would you be interested in most so I can focus on that design first.

                              <span>I have a friend who cannot eat garlic, but I&#x27;d like to him to be able to experience certain Vietnamese dishes that requires Nuoc Cham to make it taste good (Banh Hoi for example). First thing that comes to mind is shallot + scallions, but I don&#x27;t know how much the absence of garlic is going to change the Nuoc Cham flavor.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Like title says, looking to send a small (3-4 kg) package of clothes/souvenirs/… to EU, more specifically to Brussels, Belgium. 
 Any recommendations which service to use? I would hope to surely keep it below 2.000.000 VND, the duration of the shipping does not matter.
 UPS, FedEx seem to be very expensive, VN Post seems to be unreliable at times… 
 Not sure what to use. Any experiences: I’d love to hear them. TIA

I spend a lot in the country currently I live, how would you say Vietnam life is like? Are most foreigners there to save money and live very cheap or is the quality of life really good?

                              <span>My wifes family thinks that it is very risky to walk alone through less populated areas close to Hanoi, say 10km south of the inner city between those smalls villages. 
 They say the risk is that you get knocked out and then sold to the chinese(??) is that an actual risk? Are there real risks? Is it more or less dangerous as a foreigner?
 I&#x27;m asking because I like to take long walks through nature. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello kind folks! My partner and I are in Hanoi, planning to leave for Sapa soon. There&#x27;s tons of packages at the hostel advertising trekking and homestay packages for $150 Canadian and they include accommodation, food, and sleeper bus to and from Sapa to Hanoi.
 The only problem is every single one I&#x27;ve seen advertised has 12km+ daily hikes. As much as I&#x27;d love to do this, I have a bad hip from past surgery and I think my max would be 5km a day. I don&#x27;t wanna slow the groups down with my frequent rests or end up in a pain crisis in front of others.
 Has anyone heard of some good packages with less hiking for the old and sore travellers like me? Perhaps slow or partial hikes, or rides to villages 😅
 Or should we just buy our own bus to Sapa, find a hostel, and do our own day tours? Any advice? 
 Thank you!!

                              <span>Hi there,
 My friend and I are looking for the best vegetarian restaurant in Hanoi. Non-Vietnamese, a bit fancy one. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Tôi là Tèo ( biệt danh thôi 😂 ) năm nay 22 tuổi. Cách đây 3 năm, tôi có 1 mối tình khá đẹp cho đến khi tôi bị cắm sừng và rồi tôi đã trả thù người yêu cũ khiến gia đình cô ta tan vỡ. Tôi sẽ gọi nyc là H. Tôi từng rất yêu và trân trọng H ngay cả khi tôi biết bản thân mình bị phản bộ, tôi cũng chỉ chấp nhận trong im lặng. Nhưng đáp lại sự tôn trọng cuối cùng đó cô ta lại lấy tôi ra để làm trò tiêu khiển bên tên khốn kia. Rồi sau vài lần nói chuyện không thể kết thúc tôi đã gửi những bằng chứng về việc bố H ngoại tình cho mẹ H và mẹ cô ta làm ầm lên rồi li hôn. Chưa cảm thấy thỏa mãn, tôi lại khiến bố cô ta bị bắt vì tội tổ chức đánh bạc và phải ngồi tù 4 năm. Sau 1 năm chia tay, tôi nghe được tin từ vài người bạn chung của 2 đứa về việc cuộc sống cô ta khá tồi tệ khi mà bố đang phải thụ án, mẹ nuôi 2 đứa em và cô ta thì cũng khá tệ. Tôi đã không cảm thấy bất kì điều gì khi tôi nghe những điều đó. 
 Đây là câu chuyện thật của bản thân mình nhưng chỉ là vắn tắt, nếu mọi người muốn nghe đầy đủ &quot;từ tình yêu ngọt ngào đến sự trả thù không hề thương xót&quot; hãy cmt cho mình biết.

Now i got a mail saying the 2nd flight from hanoi to osaka is rescheduled to a time before my first flight reaches hanoi. Both vietjet and gotogate arent helping me with this. Also the original flight isnt cancelled. I checked the schedule for that day and it is still running. What can i do in this situation? Will vietjet rebook me on a valid flight?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just moved to Hanoi for a month or 2. After I basically settled down all my things, I&#x27;m starting to explore the city&#x27;s places. I&#x27;ve tried going on walking streets in Ho Guom, and it&#x27;s not really my thing, plus I&#x27;m just going alone, so that just feels awkward. Can you guys suggest some places for me to go, and maybe make some new friends? Any suggestion is appreciated, thank you.

                              <span>Yesterday, I took my first Ielts exam, and it wasn’t going well, I mean I did prepare for it but it was quite hard. In the writing test, I completely rushed in time. The first task is about 4 pie charts, which took me 25 minutes to finish. The second one is “Some people think that good health is very important to every person, so medical service should not be run by profit-making companies. Do the advantages of private health care outweigh the disadvantages?” I was stunned after reading it, but I still tried my best to complete the essay. When it was done, I counted the words and found out that I wrote just only 200 words, while the task requires to write at least 250 words. But I didn’t have time to add more or look over it, I had to handle it because time was up. I feel really bad now. I think I will only get 5 in writing and my parents will kill me, as I just threw their money out the window.

                              <span>My new Vietnamese girlfriend calls me &quot;Bo&quot;. I know that it means daddy/father. We are both in our 30&#x27;s and she is only 2 years younger than me. She said this is common in Vietnam. Is it really common? If so, why? Any other meaning to it?
 EDIT: She is 100% Vietnamese and born and raised in HCMC. I asked her what Bo means and she said &quot;daddy/father&quot;. She often sends me this text: Dạ bố.

                              <span>I will travel to Da Nang soon. And I want to buy some medicine while traveling to Vietnam because I heard that the price of medicine in Vietnam is cheaper. 
 The medicine I want to buy is diabetes medicine. I want to buy Metformin and Dapagliflozin. 
 Can I get Mounjaro or Ozempic, an injection-type diabetes treatment other than oral medicine, at a pharmacy without a prescription? 
 How much does it usually cost?

                              <span>I am going to Vietnam for a month, travelling around the country. I am very excited and lokking forward to it! However, I have read that people (some?) eat dog/cat. I live in a culture where dogs/cats are pets, and I have a cat myself. I know and agree that there is not a moral difference between eating cat and for instance pig or cow, but being a cat owner (and vegetarian) I know it would be very difficult to see dog/cat meat consumption. I therefore want to avoid seeing it or being reminded of it as much as I can.
 I do not know how widespread it is, so I was hoping you could tell me if there are certain areas in Vietnam, places or situations I should avoid when travelling to avoid seeing it? Does anyone have any tips for a sensitive soul?

 in addition, are these products generally affordable (for an american tourist)? i ask because asian beauty products are usually pretty marked up over here.
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello,
 My group is arriving in SGN and we are hoping to book a bus to Can Tho. Problem is, I was hoping we can get a bus that pick us up directly from the airport and also drop us off at a specific spot - would that be possible? 
 I&#x27;m looking on 12go but the pick up spot are all bus stations that are an hour walk from the airport. Please suggest any website or company, and any other advice. Thank you!

                              <span>Vietnamese lived in America here. I moved to the US 10 years ago and are on track to become a mental health therapist. It’s a job I really enjoyed as it let me help people but I spontaneously remember about Vietnam and want to ask some questions about my home town. Since my old friend group drifted away and those I’m still in contact with also moved to other countries. Would anyone mind tell me how the field of Mental Health is doing in Vietnam? Any progress for on it? Do you guys still face a lot of issues?

 19 and soon-to-be 20 yr old vnmese. Got sent to Canada since 14th and I hated myself ever since. 
 So back in grade 8th or 2017 my mom was rambling about studying abroad or relocating abroad, ofc me being a stupid 8th grade kid knew nothing. Fast forward to grade 9th and she just randomly said &quot;oh yea ur going abroad next year&quot;, again being a dumb 9th grader who knows nothing more than video games i was happy that i get to be away from my parents. It wasnt really my choice and i had no control over me going abroad but as a dumb kid i found that was to be extremely exciting. 
 Well throughout the years from grade 10th highschool to even 2nd year college I suffered from many states of depression. Language barrier wasnt really a …</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone. As a newcomer to Hanoi I have recently discovered that Taxis are impossible to get when its raining and I have been unable to get to work this morning. Can someone please explain to me, like I am a child, how to use the bus service in Hanoi? What i&#x27;m looking for are things like: Do I need to wave at the bus driver to stop or do they stop at every bus stop? Is there a button to press to tell the bus driver that I am getting off? Is every one way ticket the same price or does the price change depending on distance? Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I speak no Vietnamese other than hello and thank you.

 Em cảm ơn ạ.

                              <span>Strange question. I&#x27;ve been to VN four times. Have a foodie friend traveling through Asia who wanted to visit for a few days and asked me for recommendations. They will be working remote every day but will need to give some live presentations so a strong reliable wifi signal is important. 
 On the flip side, I wanted to recommend a place where they could also walk to local places for food. Originally I wanted to recommend Hoi An for the experience, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust the wifi enough (at least not at the bandwidth they&#x27;d need). Maybe Da Nang but the hotels that I&#x27;d assume would have the best wifi are not near areas that are very walkable and are very touristy. They could visit Hoi An for a half day trip though. Then I was thinking Nha Trang - I remember staying near the water in a modern hotel and could walk down narrow streets to some hidden gems though it was pretty touristy. That was pre-pandemic, maybe they got pushed out...not sure.
 Open to other suggestions (and I&#x27;ll probably add them to my own itinerary next trip)!

                              <span>A friend and I are flying into Hanoi early December! We have 10 days. We like adventure days but also a beach day would be nice. What mini trips should we take given the time of year?! Considering Ha Long, Nign Bihn, Sa Pa, and a flight to Da Nang/Hoi An.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ll be travelling solo through Cambodia and Vietnam. I was wondering if there are any group tours that operate day tours that I could join and socialise with other travellers.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I will stay for work in Vietnam (Northside of Ho-Chi-Minh-City),. I decided to add vacation after the business trip and stay a week in Vietnam.
 I never have been in an Asia country. Do you have any recommendations around Ho-Chi-Minh-City like jungle, beach and sightseeing? Which district is a good one for tourists?
 Is it easy to move by train or bus to my destinations or is it better to get a taxi/Uber (what will they charge)?!

 Also, other than statistics, has height increased dramatically since Vietnam has started to grow economically? To a level where it is noticeable? 
 This is for part of an economic growth study for school! Thanks!

                              <span>So, this morning I woke up and saw the news about how the concert tickets is so poorly sold is all over the place. Almost every entertainment Facebook pages, from big to small, is running this news. 
 What seems questionable to me is they&#x27;re trying to confuse people between &quot;not selling&quot; and &quot;not sold out&quot;. I assume a concert ticket not sold out after 3 days is pretty normal, but it seems they&#x27;re making it looks like not a sinlge ticket is sold and it&#x27;s the worst show ever. 
 As I don&#x27;t really care much about Vbiz, what exactly happened? Is she really that bad or just she provoked some hidden big media company?

                              <span>I&#x27;m Vietnamese and planning to go under some courses to become a tour guide. It&#x27;s the most suitable career path I could think of right now for myself, for my future. 
 I&#x27;m currently living in Hanoi, which I think is quite convenient, because I feel that tourism is our strength and is quite developed here. I mean, we have the Old Quarters and Ha Long Bay and other fascinating and breath-taking places in all the provinces close and nearby Hanoi. I&#x27;ve always thought that I&#x27;m in the best place in Vietnam if I want to persue tourism as a career path.
 But my heart and soul all lie in Sai Gon. I love Saigon and the fact it&#x27;s more gay-friendly. I&#x27;m gay and have no friends in Hanoi, I mean I do have but in Saigon I have more of my people. I want to join them, be with them, and support each other. Unlike here in Hanoi, all alone. The only thing stopping me from having moved to Saigon a long time ago is the fact that I still think Hanoi is better for persuing Tourism. I&#x27;m currently not on any career path, and I&#x27;m 23 now, It&#x27;s my career, not my social life, that I should pay attention to.
 But I love Saigon, I just don&#x27;t know how the whole tourism is for Saigon. Do I have much chances to grow with tourism, as much as I think I have in Hanoi?

                              <span>The entire reason why he lived the way he did was because he wanted to be humble and plain. He dressed, ate, and lived like an average farmer, he treated everyone as an equal and he also wanted to be treated as an equal by us as well. So why are we treating him like he&#x27;s the God Emperor from 40k. For example, we preserve his corpse in something that is almost like a temple. And yet teachers, parents and practically everyone that i talk to compares him to a god. I&#x27;m not hating on him, I appreciate his efforts in freeing this country. But I&#x27;m confused on why we are treating in the exact opposite way that he wanted to be treated.

                              <span>American here.
 When visiting to my local barnes and noble recently it was obvious from first glance that a lot of media from Asia is popular. My bookstore shelves are stocked to the brim with Japanese, Korean, even Chinese comics and light novels, figurines, the works. Korean and Japanese pop stars fill the music section, easily holding their own against big western pop stars like Gaga and Bieber.
 But aside from some novels in the young adult section of my bookstore written by Vietnamese Americans, or the usual biographies in the history section discussing the war. There&#x27;s not a lot of pop culture made by Vietnamese that&#x27;s popular in the western market as other asian countries. Not a lot of fantasy or horror novels, not a lot of manga, not even the odd pop star. 
 You&#x27;d think with how much has changed in US-Vietnam relations since the war we&#x27;d be seeing more Vietnamese pop culture get exported over here. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Why is that?
 And it&#x27;s not like Americans are biased against Vietnamese culture because of the war or years of action movies. Far from it. Vietnamese Food is very popular in places like Los Angeles and Toronto, but vietnamese pop culture seems to have fallen completely by the wayside.
 So I&#x27;m here to ask for theories on why Vietnamese media isn&#x27;t as big of a thing in the west as the other nations cultures. And also to ask for recommendations on vietnamese books, movies, tv, manga etc. that I might be interested in?

 This is my first post on Reddit community. I’m a fourth year student in university of science and I am also a software engineer but my salary is not good. Yeah I don’t have a lot of money to subcribe lessons to learn the English. My idea is that I will post a story every day. Hopefully you can help me to improve my English.
 Many thanks, Luan.

I visited Vietnam in early September this year and visited Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Da Nang. I will introduce to you some vegetarian dishes that I find strange and delicious for longtime vegetarians like me when traveling:
 1. Veganterian Pho 
 Pho
 Pho is a famous dish in Vietnam and I was quite surprised that this dish has a vegetarian version. I found Pho Chay Nhu restaurant, I will put the Google Map link here: https://goo.gl/maps/u1g84gj5PxVoZ5rS9 so you can easily find it. The restaurant is highly rated on Google, so I stopped by. This vegetarian Pho dish is very frugal because the broth is made entirely from vegetables. The toppings of this dish include tofu, mushrooms, …</span>

                              <span>So i just finished the talking with her family and results were this : I got the call at 7am my time and first i had to ask her if she set me up and her answer was this : Yes I did, i already knew that you were going to marry me i just speed up the process because i don&#x27;t want to waste more time. She jokingly said that i needed to grow a pair of balls. Back with the talk with her parents their idea we agreed that we are going to get married on paper in home country because she will get my passport. So she will be coming next month so we can do the formalities. I would love to do it in a church but thats just not possible. Second talking point was where are we going to live. I told them about my plans but i was immediately shut down. They told me that it&#x27;s better to live the first 2 3 years of the childs life near them, the reasoning here is they want to be involved in the upbringing a little bit and because it&#x27;s their first grandchild. After that they dropped the bomb that they want us to move to Singapore after those 2 3 years. Reasoning for this are plenty but I&#x27;ll list some important ones : they are opening some offices there and they need someone to manage it and my wife is the candidate, better opportunity and it&#x27;s not far away from home. I didn&#x27;t expected this but I call them after i had some time thinking about it. Third was their question of when i will be moving. Told them that if she comes in a month I&#x27;ll need about 4 months to move. Because it takes some time to move your life. Fourth was the naming. Told them that she and me have an agreement that&#x27;s if it&#x27;s boy I&#x27;m naming it and if it&#x27;s a girl she is naming it. My reason here is make continues male and female continues female.

                              <span>I have to go on a business trip to Vietnam with my team of five employees. The Vietnamese company has asked us for a $1,000 &quot;introduction fee,&quot; which appears to be a form of bribery. I&#x27;m concerned and wondering if this is common practice in Vietnam. Should I comply and give them the fee? 
 I have previous experience doing business with Chinese companies, and fortunately, I didn&#x27;t encounter such situations. This is the first time I&#x27;ve come across this issue during my business endeavours. 
 I want to hear your advice. What should I do? Should I give them the fee?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I was reading and it said one of the allowed people is “weak muscles” which I assume means elderly and woman.
  
Who is allowed to use pepper spray? The law only allows certain objects to be equipped with supporting tools, including pepper spray. Accordingly, in Clause 1, Article 55 of the Law on Management and Use of Weapons, Explosives and Support Tools 2017 stipulates that subjects equipped with combat gears include:
  
 
National Army;
 
Militia and self-defense;
 
Coast Guard;
 
Police;
 
Weak muscles;

 Any insight?

 I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re fake? Are there any real hostels in Sa Pa anyone can recommend?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I’m going on a trip in the next few weeks to Indonesia for a month to dive and then heading to Vietnam for a month to travel (planning north to south) I don’t really want to carry my dive gear around with me for the whole month. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on shipping my luggage home or if it would be cheaper to rent a locker in Hanoi and leave it there while I go down south and then fly back up to Hanoi from Ho Chi Minh and fly home from Hanoi? Online it says that shipping a suitcase from Hanoi to the US would be like $400, does that sound about right? Thank you for your help!! :)

 Has anyone here ever heard of the travel/social network Hahalolo? They appear to be planning on merging with a stock company in the United States and was wondering if I should invest!

                              <span>We are traveling to Hanoi on Thursday but couldn’t get any VND without preordering it before last weekend. We read in a few posts that you can exchange it in gold shops, however in most posts they were only talking about USD. Does anyone have experience with exchanging less popular currencies like the SEK? I (from a euro country with a bank account in euros) can withdraw from an ATM without any fees, my partner however would have to pay rather high fees so we are trying to avoid that (he cannot simply transfer to me, it is a really complicated process for him to transfer within Europe with his bank). So we were thinking of simply bringing some Swedish Leonor and exchanging it in Vietnam.
 Edit: my autocorrect changed kronor in the title to Ironie, that wasn’t my intention 😂. It seems however that I cannot edit the title anymore

                              <span>Hoping to ride the Ha Giang Loop with my wife and friend over Christmas. I have been researching the documentation needed and the results are nebulous. I have an American drivers license with motorcycle endorsement M1. So does my wife. My friend only has a drivers license, no motorcycle endorsement.
 This is what is states on: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Vietnam.html
 Because the United States is not a party to the Convention on Road Traffic, international driving permits and U.S. drivers’ licenses are not valid in Vietnam. Foreigners renting vehicles risk fines, prosecution, and/or imprisonment for driving without a Vietnamese license endorsed for the appropriate vehicle. If you wish to drive in Vietnam, contact the Provincial Public Transportation Service of the Vietnamese Department of Communications and Transport to obtain a Vietnamese driver’s license. Note that you may be required to take a medical examination as part of the driver license application process. 
 Can I get away with a International Driving Permit on the Ha Gaing Loop while remaining legal?
 Otherwise, what do I need to get? I would like to avoid bribing government officials.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Vietnamese myself, but I&#x27;m always scared shitless whenever I go out on the streets and saw parents let their kids sit in the front and drive with high speed. 
 It&#x27;s getting close to Mid-autumn festival now, so more and more parents takes their childrens out to have fun and buy them toys. I live near Hàng Mã street and I saw all kind of parents letting their kids standing up in the seat holding toys and latterns, it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re telling their children to have some practice before some circus show. It&#x27;s even scarier sometimes when I saw them carelessly speed up to pass some red lights 
 Childrens that young, if gotten in an accident and hit their head, certainly it&#x27;s going to be fatal, but it&#x27;s actually very rare to see any kids with helmets on

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know about y&#x27;all, I absolutely am annoyed with this kind of disturbance. There is clearly zero necessity for such loud noises for a motorbike to function normally. Those people are narcissistic, egoistic, uneducated individuals who think what they&#x27;re doing is cool, and they&#x27;re purposely doing it to grab other people&#x27;s attention (lack of attention much?). They also ride with super fast speed in sub-urban areas too, which is dangerous for the public&#x27;s safety where many children or elders are on the streets. Most of them are gangster-wannabe guys in their 20s or early 30s. It seems like authorities don&#x27;t do anything to seriously put an end to this, unless in popular, large streets.

                              <span>As the title suggest, why is there so few media and general public awareness about Vietnam&#x27;s intervention during the Khmer Rouge genocidal regime? I will admit I am not a history honor student, but I do remember that there was barely anything about this in the (Vietnamese) history text book. I know the political situation at the time was extremely complex, with all the communist allies infighting, fallout from the end of the Vietnam war and general fear of the Soviets at the time. But the fact that Vietnam pushed all the way to the capital of Cambodia to overthrow one of the most brutal regime in human history, all the while facing pressure not only from the Pro-Chinese countries, but also from the Western Democratic world, is one hell of a tale. Why is it so often forgotten? Link of you want to read about it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War.

 Then there’s this one where OP admits to being from China
 There’s this one also
 Then there’s this as well
 I noticed that a lot of them are trying to discredit Vietnam. It seems like a lot of Chinese see the alliance between the US and Vietnam as a threat

                              <span>Hi, my name is Xueru and I&#x27;m from China, but I&#x27;m not ethnically Chinese. My parents are from Taiwan and Vietnam. I have a different name when I live in Vietnam, which is Khanh Huyen. The story I am sharing here happened in 2018, when I first visited Vietnam. I don&#x27;t know how to say it in a way that you guys can understand, but in order to use Reddit, we have to use a VPN, and we nicknamed it &quot;Vietnamese Pho Noodle&quot;. And that&#x27;s right, the reason I wanted to come to Vietnam was because I wanted to try pho.
 After arriving in Hanoi, it was already late, so we decided to leave the sightseeing for the next morning. The next morning, my parents went to do the paperwork for me because we also intend to live in Vietnam. So my mom gave me &quot;500,000 VND&quot; (It was around 150 yuan) to go out and eat wha…</span>

                              <span>She is 23 me also. 
 The story goes like this, for our 4th anniversary we went to Thailand and one night we both got really drunk really drunk and she told me it&#x27;s OK to finish inside. As a monkey i got really excited and did it without thinking of the consequences. Month and half later i get a call with a positive test. I literally froze and the only thing i can think about is getting my shit together. I would like to point out that i don&#x27;t have a look on this situation as my life is over it&#x27;s just a natural progression of life that may happened a little earlier. She told me that she hasn&#x27;t told her parents yet because she wanted to tell me first. We had a serious talk about further progression and when will I move. After the call I immediately talked with my parents because it&#x27;s a serious shift in my life dynamic and because i need to prepare the funds for the move. The mindset of our parents was already pushing us to get married so we don&#x27;t have to worry about family disapproval. The only problem here is the sudden switch in our lives. 
 So i have a couple of questions: What&#x27;s the price of land in Hanoi? Planning on building a house Dual citizenship is it possible for all countries? Asking for the kid Is 5 years maximum for visa exemption? How much will I be paying in taxes? 
 If you have some questions for me ask me in the comment

 We&#x27;ve been in Da Nang half a day now and every single driver has asked us whether they can drive us back to the hotel and offer to hang around wherever we are so that we can use them over Grab.
 Is this expected or some sort of scam? Every time we say Grab has been perfect for us and I&#x27;ve never waited for more than 2 minutes so it&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t trust them but rather I don&#x27;t want to waste their time waiting around for us.
 Writing this as I sit in a Grab whilst the driver is trying to tell us what our plans are coming back tonight on Google Translate.

                              <span>I (24M) am currently in a relationship with my girlfriend (23F). We&#x27;re planning to get married in about 2-3 years once our financial situations improve. Recently, I was chatting with my dad about life in general, and the topic of having kids came up. Personally, I&#x27;m not too concerned about having children. I know I could be a great dad, but I&#x27;d also be perfectly fine without kids. My girlfriend has also hinted that she doesn&#x27;t want children, and I didn&#x27;t push the conversation further because either outcome is okay with me.
 When I shared this with my dad, he didn&#x27;t react well. In fact, he called both of us crazy and said we weren&#x27;t in our right minds. No matter how much I tried to explain our decision, he kept insisting that I&#x27;d change my mind eventually. This really upset me because he wasn&#x27;t respecting our choice and was trying to influence it.
 I can already see this topic coming up again in the future, and I don&#x27;t know how to get through to him. I understand that he&#x27;s getting older and wants grandchildren, which makes it tough because I know how much it would hurt him not to have his own. My older brother is also uncertain about his stance on kids. Any advice on how to handle this?

                              <span>Hi people,
 I&#x27;m Vietnamese Canadian and I have a sweet viet gf. She&#x27;s little older than me, but calls me &quot;em.&quot; often. She rarely or never calls me &quot;anh.&quot; I think it&#x27;s weird but I&#x27;m use to it now...
 I call her &quot;em&quot; or &quot;đai ca&quot; in Vietnamese. Or &quot;baby&quot; or &quot;boo.&quot; in English. 
 Is there a word to call your gf or wife if little older than you? She&#x27;s 3 years older than me, but I love her dearly as there is no age difference.

                              <span>My trip in Vietnam ends today, I was here for 13 days- Saigon, Danang, Hoi an, Phong Nha, Ninh bin, Hanoi
 The experiences that I take back home are something I’ll cherish for life. I have to be honest, I knew very little about the history of vietnam- but as I met people and visited war museum I learned so much. You guys are absolutely amazing, such hardworking, humble, helpful &amp; ambitious people. I am so inspired by you! 🇻🇳
 Special shoutout to all the women in Vietnam, you gave me food at 2AM, helped me with directions &amp; assisted me in heavy rains when my scooter broke down.
 Cảm ơn!

                              <span>Hello,
 We are 2 adults visiting Vietnam this December. We both are foodies and always love to try local cuisine.
 What are some of the local favorite places that we should not miss? We mostly prefer street food or small restaurants but can also visit upscale ones if it is worth it. We also like to try vegetarian food so please recommend if you know any good local vegetarian restaurants. 
 I know that this is a subjective question. But I am trying to see what kind of suggestions I get so I can make the best decision and cover some good spots within the few days we are in Hanoi. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello, my partner and I are planning to deliver our baby in Vietnam. We have dual citizenships for both the USA and Vietnam and are planning for the baby to keep both citizenship as well.
 Has anyone done CRBA? How was the experience? Due date is around Christmas. We&#x27;re planning to come back to the US mid March. Would it be enough time for the CRBA to process and issue a newborn passport?
 TIA

                              <span>I gave money to my Vietnamese wife to buy and invested a land property in Vietnam as foreigners are not allowed to buy land property. The pink book is in my wife&#x27;s name. When she was registering the land for the pink book, they require my consent and signature to complete the purchase. I neeeded a translator to translate the document and signed the form. That was for purchase and my question is if my wife sells the property - Does she need my consent as well to sell the land property?

There were a group of young guys breakdancing there. One of them was a young vietnamese man with a blach t-shirt and brown pants. He was really handsome and danced really nice. I was wondering if anyone here could help me find him, I would like to ask him out on a date.

                              <span>I am little freaked out before the travel. It&#x27;s a solo trip. So much to plan. So many places to see. Language barrier. 
 Please give me some tips. I am worried not to get into scam. Worried of falling sick alone in the country. The bana hills look too much crowded to me. Shall I skip it ? What is there to see except the bridge? Between hoi An and danang, where should I book hotel ? Also, is it a good idea to get a bus /train from Saigon to da nang or better to book flight ?

                              <span>Hi, I’m (F21) Vietnamese American and just got back from traveling to Vietnam for a week. I stayed in one hotel the whole trip and ended up getting along really well with the staff. We were all similar age, and I was so happy to become friends with some locals. 
 Yesterday, before I left and checked out of my hotel room, the staff asked if they could take a picture with me to keep as a memory. Since I was in a rush, I forgot to ask them for their contact info/social media and if they could send the picture to me. Now I’m really really regretting it and am sad I won’t be able stay in touch with them or remember their faces in the future…
 Do you think there is any way to reach out to the staff? Should I contact the hotel? Or would that be weird and I should just let it be?

                              <span>Will be traveling to Vietnam soon and part of my trip involves going from HCMC to Can Tho (one way). I&#x27;m hoping to hire a taxi. I looked into grab and it&#x27;s showing about 2000000 dong one way, which is cheaper than what my hotel is quoting me. Can I really just hire a grab for this trip? 
 I know there are cheaper ways (sleeper bus, moped) but I would prefer taxi and possibly making one stop along the way.

                              <span>We thoroughly enjoyed the natural beauty, but unfortunately, the city proved to be a tourist hotspot with limited attractions. The locals were notably less friendly compared to our previous experiences in Vietnam. Additionally, it was disheartening to witness young children, aged 3 to 5, selling souvenirs to tourists on the streets. Would not recommend!

                              <span>My husband and I are pretty convinced we don&#x27;t want kids and vasectomies where we&#x27;re from costs a limb so I was wondering if it could be cheaper in Vietnam. 
 Any info or estimates would be very appreciated 👏

                              <span>Hello everyone I am planning on a 3 night, 4 day guided self driving tour around the ha giang loop. I am wondering where travellers put their backpacks? Since the tour stops off at multiple hostels/home stays, do we have to carry our 50-70L backpacks with us on the bikes? 
 Also any recommendation of a hostel to book it with would be greatly appreciated, I am currently leaning towards centra backpackers Hano
 Many thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been close to this vietnamese woman. I&#x27;m 30 she&#x27;s 31. She&#x27;s in a term contract in my laboratory for 1 year. I am an introvert, so does she, and both of us have been single forever. I talk way less than her, and she always talk nonstop with me but not with others. Initially she seems couldn&#x27;t fit in with my other lab members because language barrier, so I tried to setup a trip with international students in our lab to make her comfortable. We ended up going to a lot of trips, but lately it was just only the both of us and mostly it was her idea. 
 We got busier and ended up often having dinner together. From then on I had a crush on her and one day I confess. I was rejected because she want to focus on work and family first, but also because we won&#x27;t be able to meet for that long and she doesn&#x27;t want to have a heartbreak from breakup. Strangely, we became even closer than before. Now only a few weeks before she go back to her old lab in another country, she wants me to spend the last day with her and wants to stay together with me and share a room. I am also from SEA, and I don&#x27;t think this is quite normal, as in sharing a room but not a couple. But she said it is normal in vietnam. Is this true? If you&#x27;re also a woman, I would like to know what do you think of this.
 Edit: Thank you for the replies. I tried to reply, but because this is a new account, the bot wouldn&#x27;t let me unless allowed by the actual mods. I don&#x27;t want to inconvenience the mods each time I want to reply. I am not sure about using my main account. But still, thank you.

                              <span>so i&#x27;m a hs student, việt kiều, but i went to live with family in saigon in the summer. since then we&#x27;ve been considering my transferring to an international school there, but it would only be for my final year of hs. we found one that parallels my current education seemingly perfectly; it has the program i&#x27;m in and provides the same diploma and even (supposedly) has the same standards as my current school board. nothing has been worked out or confirmed yet but i just had a few questions. 
 if anyone has been to or heard about both international schools in saigon and hs in north america, how do they compare in terms of education standards? would it be a difficult switch? what is the general student demographic - are there a lot of việt kiều or foreigners? what&#x27;s the student social life/culture like?
 edit: the specific school in mind is CIS (Canadian International School) but at this point we&#x27;ll still consider other options.

                              <span>Today was super busy and there was surprisingly a lot of people joining to draw (at least more than last week i think). This time I get to sit in a garden and it was twice more comfortable to draw than last week in which I had to sit next to a trash can and a sewer.
