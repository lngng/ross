                              <span>Hi, I have food-related question here: are beef or pork intestines popular dishes in Vietnam?
 I have plan to come to vietnam second time. i want to cook some korean food for bf extended family. My favorite one is Gopchang (grilled pork and beef intestines)
 I asked bf, but he said it’s not popular. I guess he just wants me to persuade me to cook another dishes, because he can not eat intestines 😚😙😗
 If you guys eat intestines, what is your favorite type of cooking? In Korea, we often do barbecue (grill). Are there any Korean dishes, which Vietnamese people love? I’m willing to learn and cook for them
 Last time, I asked “how to impress viet parents” in this sub. Your suggestions helped me a lot, and I was successful. Thank you 🙏 🙏

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m traveling to VN soon and wanted to get my friend who loves self-care a gift from the states. Are there any brands or products that are sought after or hard to find in VN that I could get here in the states?
 Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!
 edit: preferably something not Dior or Chanel( because I know she has a bunch), would something like Hourglass, Glossier, or Kosas work? She&#x27;s in her late 20s.

                              <span>Greetings all. I bought some of this grape candy to try and was surprised to find a very hard kernel inside. My kids chomped right down into it, assuming it was a hard candy intentionally placed at the center of this soft jelly-like candy. I just had a crown placed so no way I’m biting something this hard, haha!
 Any idea what the kernel is? I tried to take a picture of it (2nd photo). Many thanks in advance!

                              <span>This goes back by about five generations at least but does anyone else have stories of relatives who were sent to Reunion Island due to French slaver trade or know more about the history of that place and era around 1600-1700?
 I&#x27;m not interested in raising animosities but would like to learn more about the era and see if others are searching or have their own family stories from the era as there&#x27;s word from a grandparent&#x27;s grandparent that some relatives were captured and sent there. 
 Are there any Vietnamese memorials, communities in Reunion Island or organizations dedicated to those who were stolen as a result?

                              <span>Hi,
 My name’s Dom and I’m part of an all asian theater collective based in Montreal! 
 We are travelling to Vietnam to do research for our next show. We will be in Hanoi from October 24 to 29 and Saigon from 29 to the 2!
 I was wondering if you guys had any theater plays or concerts we could go to while we are there!
 I’ve looked at the productions at the Saigon Opera House but, we’re looking for something a bit more contemporary/avant-garde if that’s possible! 
 Anyways, if you have any artistic recommandations (contemporary danse shows, art museums, alternative music, great coffee shops, librairies,etc..) or are an artist in Vietnam, it would be amazing to connect! 
 Thanks!

                              <span>This question might be silly but I’m just curious. I’m watching Young Sheldon (the series is set in Medford, Texas in the 80s-90s btw), and Sheldon has a Vietnamese friend named Tam. His mom always packs dimsum for him, to the point he’s sick of it.
 Dimsum is generally a Chinese food. I know we have dimsum here too but it’s still thought of as a Chinese food, or đồ Hoa.
 So my question is, do Vietnamese Americans have dim sum for lunch that often too? Or is it just another case of filmmakers/showrunners mixing up Asian people and following stereotypes?
 Again, this is just me contemplating about things in life. No big deal either way. So let me know your perspective. Thank you.

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 Im coming to Vietnam, to Ho Chi Minh 11th October, and I&#x27;m really confused. We have 11 days available and we returning to the same airport. My question is: What to do there? :) I had a lot of work before holiday and I couldn&#x27;t prepare for this. Im starting now :) 
 I was wondering about rental motorbike, but im not sure cause im going with my girlfriend and we have 2 big backpacks. What do you think guys?
 And im looking for something special, im not big fan of architecture, rather we prefer local experience and nature. I don&#x27;t like the crowds too, but I know that&#x27;s normal in big cities and popular attractions. 
 ​
 In short - can you give us some hidden gems? And what do you think about rental 2 bikes ( My GF is driver too) and traveling from Ho Chi Minh to Hoi An. Or maybe we should take a plane and rent bikes there? And last but not least - weather. Im a little nervous when I see a forecast.

But I don&#x27;t know where to start or to get actual sources from, would be helpful if anyone recommend where to learn starting from the beginning, either in Tiếng Việt or English is fine. Cảm ơn

                              <span>As per title, recently those type of questions pop up rather frequently in this sub to the point I find it unreasonable. 
 The more of those questions pop up and the more I read into it, the less I see it is related to the Vietnamese country/ the culture/ the people.
 It might only have to do with that particular, very specific family/ relationship/ situation being in question. Regardless the whole nation is called into question for some behavior.
 You guys do know that Vietnam is a country of over 100m population, with polarized income and living conditions, plus having worldwide diasporas (in North America, Australia, European continent, African continent, East Asia, the Middle East) so finding an average Nguyen is nigh impossible, right???
 Instead of asking “Why my Vietnamese relative treat me like shit?” or “Why Vietnamese male drink coffee all morning and doesn’t go to work?” People can rephrase it such as “why my relative treat me like shit?” - does the fact that they are Vietnamese or Vietnamese immigrants play any roles in the question?

                              <span>Apologies if you are tired of recent threads with similar titles, but I am curious what perspectives Vietnamese people here can offer about my country and people. I have met many Việt kiều (越僑) over the years.

                              <span>long story short, i’m a 19 year old girl studying in America. My dad has 13 other siblings most of which live in America as well, and for whatever reason it’s like every week they pick and choose whether to treat me, my mom, and my dad like shit or not. it’s like a sick ranking! it’s horrible. especially after my dad died and they barely cared, he died in a horrible car accident too, and yet we barely get any phone calls, much less any sympathy at all from them. it’s been 10 months now that he’s gone and yet they always gossip, body-shame, manipulative, clout-chase, and make me and my mom feel horrible! and we didn’t even do anything… my mom is vietnamese too and she’s the sweetest person ever. just, why? why are they so mean? is it because they are vietnamese? or jealous? what’s going on? i always feel like i’m doing something wrong, like i’m actually too pu**y, but heck am i gonna say to them, i don’t like ur 30 LV bags?

                              <span>Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m half Vietnamese, and I was not raised by my Vietnamese side. I&#x27;m the oldest of 6 kids my father had. Initially, my father didn&#x27;t want any part of me when my mother got pregnant because I was an accident. He impregnated my mom when he was 25, and she was 15. Before I was born, he tried to persuade my mom to have an abortion. I met him for the first time at the age of 5 and then reconnected with the family at the age of 12. My stepmom is mostly the reason why I wasn&#x27;t around, as my father lied to her and never disclosed my existence until my mom basically gave him an ultimatum to accept me as his son. If he didn&#x27;t, she would take him to court for child support, which she did, and he paid until I turned 18. My stepmom is also the reason I re-entered the family …</span>

                              <span>I’m a woman born in Europe and my parents are Vietnamese.
 My father teaches me that it’s a woman’s job to take care of the household and the kids. Meanwhile he expects me to do a master’s degree and work full time as well. He teaches me things like: - It’s fine for men to have a high body count before marriage but girls should keep themselves pure - It’s a woman’s job to do the cooking, cleaning, etc. (including things like having to cut my husband’s finger and toe nails) - I shouldn’t do a doctor’s degree because men are deterred from women with higher education - It’s justified if my husband cheats if I don’t provide him with a warm meal and children
 My mother works full time as well but he feels entitled to everything she does for him. If there’s no food or the food is too salty for example, he starts to shout and says “without me, you would be living in the streets.”
 Is that normal for our Vietnamese culture? I’ve never seen him grateful for how we support him.

                              <span>Hello! As the title already states, which city is the best to visit in December?
 My best friend and I haven&#x27;t seen each other for years (we live in different countries now) and we&#x27;re thinking of travelling and reuniting in Vietnam. 
 We both would like to indulge ourselves in Vietnam&#x27;s food and culture. We both enjoy long walks, have some drinks, and trying out some things new! (something more &quot;local&quot; and maybe not too touristy haha)
 Any recommendations and suggestions are highly appreciated. Thank you! :)

                              <span>I will be backpacking through Vietnam and Cambodia in November and am looking for what kind of shoes I should bring. Looking at a lot of reddit posts I&#x27;ll probably bring some sandals (maybe Columbia Breaksiders?) for light walks and water activities but I will also go to Sa Pa and other places where I would like to hike. Since the weather won&#x27;t be as hot as in the summer, do you guys think some light hiking boots would be a good idea as a second pair and if so do you have any suggestions (I looked at the Merrell Nova 3 Mid for example)? I like hiking shoes that go over your ankles to prevent injuries on rugged terrain.
 Thank you guys in advance!

 Not super interested in doing a cruise but a traveller in passing mentioned Cat Ba does fishing boat tours. Haven’t been able to find much information online about them, do they exist and what do they involve in finding out about them? Also any other general Cat Ba recommendations are welcome!

                              <span>Hoping this messages helps other travelers - if you’re from the US and are trying to use your Wise card it’s not supported here. Cambodia too
 After reading that it’s not uncommon for foreign bank cards to not work at some ATMs, I laced up my walking shoes and tried literally 17 ATMs, all unsuccessfully. I always tried 2 mil, I tried adding money to my USD wallet, I tried walking to the CitiBank atm, nothing. Eventually I went to the Wise website to see if something was locked with my card and I stumbled on a support page that listed countries that US accounts won’t work in. 
 I have a card from my US bank so I’ll probably just take the fee on the chin or consider using the Western Union app to send myself some money in the morning.

                              <span>I am vietnamese living in Canada for 6 years. I had a Canadian gf, and she’ll become my fiancé soon this year.
 I have a plan to come back to my country and work there for a long time. I asked my gf, and she agreed to relocate with me. We’ll move to vn in February next year. I am happy she’s willing to follow me. But I’m worried that she may struggle to adapt to living and workenvironment in Vietnam.
 As a foreigner living vn, what were your difficulties in living and working? Esp female foreigners (female and male may have different concerns). How did you overcome them?
 What can I do to help her go through tough time? She doesn’t need to worry about money, living place. We only care how she can get a good job, have positive experience and avoid being culture shocked or anxious
 She wants to learn the language. Can you suggest any language centers or tutors teaching foreigners Vietnamese?
 Any Vietnamese or foreigner having the same situation here, can you share your experience? I appreciate all your suggestions!!!!
 You may wonder why I don’t stay in Canada. I actually got PR of Canada. I am working for an American firm. The company is building a new factory in a north province of vietnam. I was chosen to work as one of managers in that factory, because I can speak the language. I will work in my home country like “expat” 😂😂. This is also a good chance for me to make a big chunk of money.😁

 Any usual pitfalls/quirks about landlords and realtors? Should something be explicitly checked for and settled at the contract stage? Are large deposits and commissions common?
 Any info from your experience would be of a great help :)
 I will be most likely settling in District 7, since thats where my office will be, and hearing that its a lot more spacious, green and unconjested compared to the center districts.

                              <span>Hi! I’m strongly considering working remotely in Asia since my employer does not mind global relocation. 
 A few stops on this hypothetical trip will be Philippines, Japan and Vietnam.
 Never been to Asia, no clue what to expect. 
 Are there many digital nomads working abroad in this fashion? Are foreigners generally well regarded?
 Where are some common or recommended areas to do something like this?
 Forgive my ignorance, thought I’d post here to get some general feedback.

 Trước đó 1-2 tháng mình đã đem laptop đi vệ sinh, dán keo ở tiệm người quen của ông cậu.

 ** Trước đây lướt Chrome quạt có kêu nhưng ko liên tục 2 ngày ạ.Hình 1 là ảnh mình chụp dc khi bật máy tính, dựa vào từ khóa &quot;manufactoring&quot; đi tra GG thì có kết quả hình 2 ạ, câu cuối cùng của nó làm mình rén quá.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always wondered why the Viets always drive in different lanes at the same exact speed in highways and express ways (including big fucking trucks staying in all the lanes, super frustrating but never mind), and after watching this video I realize it&#x27;s a bigger problem that it&#x27;s affecting many other countries, even the US
 Since I&#x27;m from the EU, I had no idea how it worked elsewhere, but it&#x27;s just common sense in the EU to not stay constantly in the left lane unless I&#x27;m passing someone else. I believe in some countries you can get even fined if you occupy the left lane for no reason 
 Do you believe a culture of left lane for passing only can be adopted here? Or is it too late now to create such culture? (talking about the highways reserved for cars only, not the normal roads)

                              <span>Hi everyone! Australian here who will be travelling for the first time to Vietnam for one week. I love Vietnamese food (Banh Mi, soups and salads) and excited to try authentic fare as well as experience the culture. Some of my questions and concerns needing answers from travelers who have been there: -Visa. I believe visitors will need a visa to enter. Could anyone share the link to apply for the visa application? Can it be an online application, how much and how long to get the visa. -Money to get around. Are credit cards accepted or only cash? -Wifi access. Would getting a local SIM to access the internet be the best way? Do the Vietnamese telcos offer inexpensive prepaid SIMs and roughly how much? -Must sees and do&#x27;s in Ho Chi Minh. Recommended places of interest to see and unique experiences would be great. -Souvenirs. What&#x27;s good to bring home from Vietnam? I would appreciate your practical tips and suggestions. Thanks in advance.

The communities are strong and supportive. The people are kind, welcoming, and patient. There is one thing that drives me crazy though. I routinely find the process of asking a question and receiving a response from Vietnamese people to be painful. The same goes for politely declining invitations. I say no politely time after time after time and it doesn&#x27;t seem like anyone hears me unless I get animated, frustrated, exasperated, or leave. The same goes for answering questions. They SAY something in response, but they don&#x27;t answer, they often just change the subject, reiterate their previous statement without answering my question , or mov…</span>

                              <span>Hello, 
 As the title says, I got an offer from ILA for Can Tho! On the surface, things sound pretty decent, especially since they offer a housing allowance. 
 My pay according to the contract (before taxes) is 473,000 VND an hour (20 teaching hours a week), on top of a housing allowance of 7,000,000 VND per month. It&#x27;s a standard 12-month contract. 
 My main priorities are to learn how to be a good teacher, save as much as I can, and try to avoid stress as much as possible. That being said, I want to make sure ILA is a good fit for me. I don&#x27;t mind the region I&#x27;m staying in (Can Tho) since I doubt I&#x27;m gonna leave my apartment much... for me, the priority is just learning a local culture and saving money. 
 Does anyone have any experiences with ILA that they&#x27;d be willing to share? I understand that avoiding stress is impossible as a teacher, but I just want to make sure that they&#x27;ve got a good support system in place. The last thing I want is to be overworked or overwhelmed with stuff that they didn&#x27;t mention in the interview or the contract... only to realize I could&#x27;ve had that same experience here, in the states. 
 Long story shrot, this is the only offer I think I&#x27;ll be getting from Vietnam... and I&#x27;m stuck between taking it and just giving up and sticking to living in the states. I don&#x27;t want to go overseas and get burned out on teaching since I&#x27;m gonna be doing that for a living... 
 Please let me know, thank you.

                              <span>For my fellow expats and everyone&#x27;s safety, last week I didn&#x27;t have enough cash on hand so i had to use my credit card at a lounge here in HCMC however, i woke up this morning and found out i was charged a ridiculous amount by the same place. (which i didn&#x27;t make). To be honest i think they got a hold of my credit card information and now i have to dispute this. I just thought i&#x27;d share this so please be careful and aware everybody. 
 It&#x27;s in D1 , and the credit card dispute team can&#x27;t help me right now at the moment because of the time zone differences so I&#x27;ll have to wait until night time to settle this . 
 This really sucks, but i would share this because I wouldn&#x27;t want anybody to deal with a situation like this, especially overseas.

 6 women, including 4 Vietnamese, were rescued by French police in the back of a refrigerated truck after sending a text message asking for help.
 French police announced that they stopped a refrigerated truck on September 27 on the E15 highway near Drace, north of Lyon and discovered 6 women, including 4 Vietnamese and two Iraqis, in the cramped trunk full of bananas. BBC reported on September 28.
 Laetitia Francart, prosecutor of the Villefranche-sur-Saone region, north of the city of Lyon, eastern France, said the group of women got into the back of a truck with Irish license plates hoping to reach Britain or Ireland.

They usually watch reruns when it is on and always laugh and enjoy it, but when I ask them about actually going to see it live they seem indifferent.
 Are older Vietnamese parents actually into PBN and secretly would love to go? Or do they not really care for the program all too much?

 I would like to start with my first experience with this issue. After I finished with my university, I got hired into a Vietnamese branch of a Japanese self-driving car start up. Things were fine back then except for one thing. My CEO. He was a total Japanese-supremacy guy (He is Vietnamese, btw).

                              <span>Specifically my cat. She is a 6kg (~12lb) American Short Hair, fully vaccinated. Please let me know the necessary documents and procurers for bringing cats into Vietnam through Noi Bai International Airport. 
 It would also be greatly appreciated if yall can give me some recommendations on airlines that will be allowing pets. I&#x27;m coming from Canada and it looks like I will be transferring through an intermediate airport. Last time I checked Taiwan doesn&#x27;t allow live animals in so Eva Air is cancelled out. 
 Thanks a lot.

                              <span>Hello! Asking for a friend...
 What are the realistic job opportunities in HCMC and/or Hanoi for someone who speaks neither English nor Vietnamese? More specifically, for someone who speaks Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese (has Italian and Brazilian citizenship), and who has work experience in programming, IT, and graphic design, and also has &quot;uncertified&quot; skills in construction and furniture building? 
 I know that being a Digital Nomad or working remotely for a European country are obvious answers, but I&#x27;m wondering about on-the-ground, potentially Visa-sponsored gigs? I do not yet live in Vietnam, so when I search on my Dell from the USA, even if I search in Spanish (my second language), my results are highly skewed and unhelpful.
 If anyone has links, knows of good recruiting companies, or anything, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it! Equally, if the answer is that my friend would be SOL, thank you for the frankness 😅

                              <span>I just got to Da Nang. I took a Grab to my hotel, but didnt realize the Grab wanted me to pay in cash. I eventually found an ATM and paid the guy 100,000 instead of 57,000 (which is still cheap by US terms i think).
 How much cash should I keep on hand? In case a place Im at does not accept cards. Also, how do I find an ATM?

                              <span>I just don&#x27;t know, I just find Chinese music and lyric much more lyrical, meaningful and impactful. I&#x27;m just attracted to it more, the lyric, the melody, the words. 
 I do not support and could not stand China&#x27;s conservative politic and misogynistic attitude. I hate them to the core, but I just really really love the art side of its culture, its music and its architecture. I&#x27;m just much more drawn to them and find them more attractive. It&#x27;s just that, you know, China has been our life-long &quot;enemy&quot;, I feel like it&#x27;s wrong of me to like things from them

                              <span>There seems to be a lot of regional variation. I think the standard rule (if there is such a thing), is to use the same address (anh, chi, em) based on one&#x27;s own sibling&#x27;s age. But what about if the husband or wife of your sibling is younger than you? In most traditions, you still follow the &quot;standard rules&quot;, but I&#x27;ve met people who address the younger (in age) sibling-in-law as &quot;chu, cau, co, di&quot;, as though they were addressing them in place of their children. What tradition do you follow, dear Redditors?

Gabapentin, muscle relaxers, beta blockers, Ubrelvy for migraines, epi-pen and benedyl for food allergies, and Aleve and Tylenol. I wanted to make sure that bringing in medications like these are safe? I also have a cream that contains Ketamine but I would assume a med like this would cause problems.

                              <span>Where do I find? 
 I’m looking for a female chef/home cook, from southern vietnam who can help preparing 3 meals a day, and can help with other kitchen chores for a working family (Vietnamese wife, husband, no children) 
 This opportunity is based in Dubai, so visa, flights, good salary, private room etc is provided 
 How do I find someone remotely? Any suggestions? 
 I have tried Facebook groups but no luck.

                              <span>I have a brother. My dad mentioned him once when I was young, didn’t bring him up for years, then finally told me about him again and confirmed it wasn’t a fever dream. 
 My brother would be in his mid to late thirties. My dad was half white and was kicked out of the hospital by my brother’s grandma. He wasn’t allowed to see his son after that. My dad eventually made it to America but has always missed my brother. My grandma did not know of my brother because he was born out of wedlock. I accidentally let it slip. 
 I’m contemplating doing a DNA test and potentially finding him. I want to do an American one as well since my grandpa (my dads father) was a lieutenant during the war. Though, I do want to meet my brother the most. To let him know my dad didn’t willingly abandon him. Have them meet. Help my grandma meet her first grandchild as she always thought I was the first. 
 If anyone has any insight, that’ll be extremely helpful. Thank you.
 Edit: when I ask, “do people in Vietnam do these tests” it’s because I’m asking if it’s commonplace and if it’s as popular in other countries. I want to see if there is any percentage of a chance it’ll work.

                              <span>In your opinion, other than the An Thuong area, what is a desirable neighorhood(s) in Danang for locals?
 An Nhon (near Korea town) seems pretty nice. Also the area near the Foreign Language University.
 But i have a hunch that I havnt really found the desirable, nice Danang neighborhood yet. Any tips where I can look?

 We love to drink and eat good food. She is very interested in renting a moped, but I can’t seem to find a tour where a guide takes us around and we drive them ourselves. Something unique would be awesome!!

                              <span>Firstly, let me preface this by saying I adore Vietnam, the culture, the strong will and tenacity of the people in the face of adversity, the dynamism, the air of progress, and the fascinating history, museums and sites. 
 That said, I have one major point of complaint: the state of infrastructure - in particular - transport infrastructure - in the country, is totally unacceptable. 
 Now I know Vietnam is still a relatively poor country, and is still significantly behind the likes of Thailand or Malaysia in economic development (although it is progressing rapidly). But even for a country at its income level (real per capita GDP of $15k), it’s still not good enough. And fixing it will be crucial if Vietnam is to have sustainable long run economic success and capitalise on current investment…</span>

I’m looking for any tips regarding travel, airports, day-to-day life, do’s and don’ts, etc. This is my first experience traveling overseas. 
 Also, what vaccines and over the counter medications are recommended? 
 Thank you in advance! I can’t wait.

However, I just got the result this morning. Guess what, I got 6 with an overall score of 7. It took me 2 months to reach this score, and I’m so f cheerful about it. Anyway, i just want to spread my happiness.

                              <span>Idk if this is the right place to post here. I feel like Zalo’s the most popular messaging app in Vietnam so maybe the story would make sense to some here, to some extent. 
 For context: I broke up with my ex over 3 years ago and we haven’t talked ever since. It was a peaceful, face-to-face breakup. When we were together she made an IG for me bc I didn’t use IG (she only posted fluffy lovey dovey stuff of us there, I didn’t have access to it). I have been together with my current gf for almost 2 years. 
 For the main story, I was using my gf’s phone and while on her app switcher screen, I saw she was browsing my ex-made instagram account on Zalo browser. I got startled and immediately went to the Zalo app to see how she came across it. 
 Apparently “I” was the one who sent it to her on Zal…</span>

                              <span>Once a week or so I try to make a habit of giving a little money to a beggar. I just want to check that in giving it to the people that need it the most. Are lotto ticket sellers basically verified as poor and are given those tickets by the government to sell? They only get a commission per ticket so it&#x27;s better for them if I just give them the cash and let them keep the ticket?
 I&#x27;ve also been told to avoid giving money to women carrying drugged babies and children selling stuff, particularly around Bui Vien they are owned by mafia and don&#x27;t get to keep the money themselves/ aren&#x27;t allowed go to school.
 Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong with anything as I&#x27;m only going off what I&#x27;m told.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My recently purchased Galaxy S23 on the US Verizon network won&#x27;t unlock automatically for another month. Verizon refuses to do it before then. I want to use a local sim when I arrive on Friday but would need to get the phone unlocked. 
 I&#x27;ll be staying in D1 on PNL. Any recommendations for some place that can network-unlock my phone for me?
 Thanks everyone!
 Edit: I would like a local phone number so I can use Grab.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m a pretty experienced motorbike driver, but before wandering to this side of the world, I did not ask for my international driving permit. I do have valid national driving license for motorcycles of all cc, but legally that is worthless in Vietnam.
 My question is simple: how risky is it if I try to do the Ha Chiang Loop on my own, without an IDP? Are there mandatory checks somewhere? Are they somehow skippable?
 I understand that this is at all NOT recommended, but desperate times call for desperate means. And driving experience is not an issue, really.
 I&#x27;m eager to hear your experience, but I guess it&#x27;s more valuable if you didn&#x27;t take a big group tour. I&#x27;d really prefer doing this on my own.
 Cheers and happy travels!

                              <span>For context, due to multiple issues( weak health, financial burden, etc) I decided to take break for a year and today was the first day I started going to college. However, after a whole day of studying I felt drained? And I have a feeling that applying to college was a huge mistake or something. I&#x27;m think about withdrawing my college tuition fees if this keeps going on in the future.
 I applied to the Diplomatic Acedamy of Vietnam(DAV) by the way. Was it because I took a break for so long that I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to being lazy all day? Or was it something else? DAV is famous for having cut-throat competitive environment so maybe that&#x27;s why? I felt totally intimidated by the environment. Maybe it was a huge mistake applying here. Deep down I have always had the desire to run away from society and become a hermit or a beggar so that I can get this mental turmoil off my head.
 I know some of you might think that I am being childish or immature but really, it got so bad that I quitted everything for a whole year and stayed at home doing nothing but house chores and walking around the neighborhood. Honestly I don&#x27;t know what the fuck is wrong with me anymore. I am thinking of using my remaining savings to... run away somewhere before... committing suicide.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m looking to travel to Vietnam for a 2 week vacation starting in the middle of November. I will be travelling solo, Male 38.
 I like a mix of things when travelling, the most important being: Local food and culture, nightlife (bars), local sporting events, beaches, cultural history, and potentially bringing my golf clubs. I&#x27;ve been looking at staying in Hanoi for a week and then heading to Ha Long Bay.
 I&#x27;ve also been reading about starting in HCMC and making my way up through Da Nang/Hoi An. I&#x27;m not huge into spending days travelling, so was wonder if people have input on HCMC and surrounding areas vs Hanio and surrounding?

 A rescue team went there and they were told by the owner that they&#x27;ll do as they please with their dogs. 
 Can anyone offer some advice? Or does anyone know someone that can help? 😢

 Anyone know of a company in Da Lat from whom we can rent three motorbike/scooters - something like an Air Blade - and return them somewhere in HCMC? 1 week rental.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Just got to Hanoi from America and I am so impressed with how everyone drives. There don’t appear to be any rules, not sure why an effort was even made to paint lanes, and traffic lights are simply a suggestion. In spite of all of this, everyone seems to navigate the roads in a chaotic harmony. After the initial terror of crossing a street, my wife has embraced the chaos and now takes joy in pointing out the motorbike with six kegs on it or the man somehow carrying an entire workshop on his back. 
 Vietnam is amazing.

                              <span>Or are you not allowed to?
 Last week my dad got hospitalized due to suspision of streptococcus suis contraction. Still to today they havent (or dont) tell him if he actually has it or not or what he actually has regardless of his repeated inquiries and their repeated blood tests.
 Same story early this year, at a different hospital. My mom got a &quot;heart situation&quot; and we called for an ambulance. On the way to the hospital the ER people said it was a myocardial infarction (heart attack). However, the doctorS (stress on plural cause multiple of them reviewed her case and i saw it) said they &quot;dont think&quot; that&#x27;s the case. They suspect it to be a heart failure, &quot;maybe&quot; caused by either hypotension or hypoglycemia. Thats about everything they ever said during an entire week she was there.
 Well, here I am half a year later and still have no clue what actually happened to my mother and how i could prevent it from happening again. Cause they dont tell me or her or my dad. They just said dont worry rest well blah blah. They dont even give us the medical record, just a prescription paper in which it said thats the illness were &quot;related to coronary artery disease and other types of diabetes&quot;.
 So why cant you tell us whats wrong with us? You cant or you&#x27;re not allowed to? Is it a personal thing or a professional thing? Is it a public vs private hospital thing? Or you cant be bothered to talk to us cause you&#x27;re too busy?
 PS: please people in the comments, im really concerned about my parents and them keep being kept in the dark. Im not trying to be smart or condescending or presumptious. If you live in HCMC and know a hospital with high quality transparant service, do tell me.
 Tldr: my parents have been hospitalized on 2 seperate occasions and nobody ever told them what they actually have.

                              <span>Would it be comparable to the Keiretsus of Japan or the Chaebols of Korea in terms of how much influence it has over Vietnamese economy, politics and society? Or is it something more?
 Similarly, is working for VinGroup viewed as prestigious? And finally, are foreigners viewed differently if they are working for VinGroup as opposed to more generic foreigner jobs like being an English teacher or passport bro?

                              <span>When listening to recordings of vietnamese leaders like Nguyễn Phú Trọng, Phạm Minh Chính, Nguyễn Cao Kỳ (went south after 1954) along with older northerners (think those &gt;65 years old), I find that their pronunciation is much less exaggerated than northerners today (youth-mid 40s). The modern northern dialect (Hà Nội standard) sounds very throaty and dense than what the boomers sound like. What exactly happened?

                              <span>Planning to visit Hanoi this December and then going for a bike ride through Ha Giang loop. I&#x27;m guessing it will be quite cold at the time so I wanted to know if there&#x27;s some place in Hanoi where I can rent/buy-sell warm clothes and other gear?
 Just that I didn&#x27;t want to pack these things while coming and increase my luggage resulting in paying extra airline charges. I would be in your debt if there&#x27;s some suggestion on this.
 So basically, I want to buy a jacket in Vietnam, use it and then sell it back in Vietnam itself.
 Had added this as a comment in the pinned thread but didn&#x27;t get any reply so posting.

                              <span>Hello, so i am having my first solo travel in November.
 At the moment I scheduled 25 days in Vietnam. However from viewing different itineraries and youtube videos I was kina turned off by south Vietnam.
 My main priorities are breathtaking nature and sporty/extreme activities, like ziplines, surfing, diving.
 I don&#x27;t care for big cities ,cultural tours, partying and craftsmentship workshops (which i heared there are a lot of in Hoi-an). Originally I was planning to go with my girlfriend, and these activities are fun as a couple, but I just don&#x27;t think I will enjoy them as a solo traveler.
 I have read that north Vietnam&#x27;s nature is amazing and compared to it South Vietnam is underwhelming and has more of the content that i am less inclined towards.
 Therefore I am considering the option of doing about 2 weeks in North Vietnam, focusing on the Loop, The caves, Sapa etc, and then transfering for a short diving/surfing vacation in the phillipins(which excites me but I was originally fine to give up to travel with my ex-gf) . I thought about Thailand as well but i had been there a few years ago. I might be able to add a few days to a week to my trip for that.
 I would love to hear about if someone thinks the plan is feasible / change my mind regarding south Vietnam/ present another option (Cambodia?)
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi everyone, I will be traveling to Vietnam in November and I will mostly stay in the North of Vietnam (Ha Giang, Sapa, Ha Long Bay, Ninh Binh) where the weather will be nice. I love outdoor stuff like hiking and trekking and therefore I would love to visit Phong Nha Ke Bang national park (it looks absolutely stunning!) and do an overnight trekking tour there. However, it seems that the national park is located in central Vietnam where November is part of the raining season. As a result Oxalis is not offering a lot of tours but I found another organization (Jungle Boss) that is offering several tours, even in caves. 
 I’ve been trying to find out how bad it really is in November based on the experiences of other travelers and information on websites, but I’m getting lots of contradictory results. Is it a 100% chance of rain every day and should I be expecting rain all day long? Or should I expect some short (but intense) showers every day and is there also chance to see some sun? 
 Also, when I look up temperatures most websites mention temperatures between 66°F (19°C) to 75°F (24°C), however, on other websites I read that it can get unbearably cold during the night. It’s very confusing as I would not describe 20 degrees Celsius as unbearably cold. 
 I know it would be best to come back to Vietnam for the central part another time, but I don’t think I’ll be back in Vietnam soon as there are so many other places on my travel bucket list as well. And I also know that the weather can’t be predicted but it would be great to hear at least some real experiences from other travelers in November. Not just in Ke Bang national park but experiences from central Vietnam in general will be appreciated.
 (My native language is not English, sorry for any misspelling)

                              <span>Hi all, I am planning a trip to Vietnam + Cambodia for 2 weeks second half of April. Hanoi (w/ Halong Bay + Ninh Binh), Siem Reap + Angkor Wat, and Hoi An. 
 How does the burning season (in N Thailand/Chiang Mai and other parts of SEA) affect Vietnam and Cambodia? I was seeing some pictures of Halong Bay from this past April and it looks super hazy, the skies aren’t blue, which got me wondering. I would like to have good visibility especially for the traveling and cruise and our time in Ninh Binh and Angkor Wat especially. Would love any feedback or thoughts or even a better time to go (I haven’t booked flights yet). Was thinking about pushing it to May but May looks so hot!
 Thank you!!!

As a local who takes out friends often from different parts of the World, I got tired of telling them to avoid Ben Thanh market and lots of those tourist trap places that bloggers fall for. So after taking out numerous friends out and their friends of friends. I decided to share my experiences and best places in Youtube. I also wanted to capture how the life of a local is living here in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City).

                              <span>I’ve submitted a couple of these and an email with no response.
 I submitted my e-visa application on September 15th, still waiting for it to come back. It still says it’s “processing” My wife and son got theirs back like 5 days ago. We’re in Thailand waiting to go to Vietnam, we’re just about to pull the plug on the trip. It’s weird and a pretty dumb, imo that you can’t submit these as a family so they are processed together.

                              <span>Hi folks, I am looking for a summer English immersion program (for 2024) for a 14 year old nephew, preferably in HCMC. 
 Does anyone have any experience attending any such school for the summer, or any programs of the sort. 
 I see there are some options for international schools with camps and activity components, like AIS and ISHCMC.
 Just wanted to ask the community in the event there were other local programs not showing up on search results that folks can recommend or can share their personal experience of having gone through.

This move would occur 6 days after check-in. He offered us a day&#x27;s price of the condotel rental to compensate. We obliged, and they offered to help us transport our luggage from the old unit to the next unit if we weren&#x27;t available to move it. We agreed as we had arrangements for a tour on the moving day which meant we would not be present for the transfer.

                              <span>Something I&#x27;ve noticed is sharing is HUGE in Vietnamese culture. At first I didn&#x27;t realize why every time I had tortilla chips in the back of the shop, they would always get eaten by the end of the business day. Nobody would ask me to eat my snacks/dinners/etc. This never bugged me but it did always cross my mind when I would go to take my food home and there was no food left! It now appears to me, having been to a recent work banquet, where my co-workers grabbed several smaller bowls and placed different variations of their pho and egg noodles for me to taste. And it doesn&#x27;t stop there, they always offer me to try new things. From desserts with potato to different variations of noodles. I&#x27;m happy to be here, what can I do to express my gratitude?

                              <span>Recently, I traveled to Vietnam and only went to Hue/Hoi An/Da nang. 
 They are all very good cities in central Vietnam. My favorite is Da nang! When you go to Hue, you can see the ancient Hue Imperial City and the famous Temple. You can walk by the river during the day and go to nearby bars to drink and listen to songs at night. It is a very pleasant life.
 The day and night in Hoi An Ancient Town are particularly attractive. Walk around the ancient town during the day, go to a nearby coffee shop for a cup of coffee and some cake. You can also go to the riverside at night, and both sides are very beautiful! There are many famous restaurants nearby! My favorite coffee shop is Mia Coffee. Their cakes are very delicious and the coffee is also great. It should be reminded that Hoi An&#x27;s consumption is higher than that of Hue and even in Da nang, which may be due to tourist cities! What you get with the same money is not worth it! But this is the reason why it is a tourist city. It should be noted that there are some stores that do not indicate the price, and the boss may overpay tourists!
 I mainly went to Monkey Mountain and the Pink Church in Da nang, as well as the Cham Sculpture Museum. If you are interested in Cham culture, you can go and have a look! Very good! You can also go to the holy places of Meishan, which are some historical relics of Hinduism. The night in Da nang is beautiful! There are many lively bars where you can go for a drink. However, I ended up spending time at the Hilton Hotel in Da nang. During the day, I also went to the beach for a drink, ate some snacks, and lay on the beach chair to read. It was very comfortably. The executive lounge of the Hilton Hotel is also very good! You can eat very delicious food at 6 p.m.! There are also bartenders to drink! The staff is great!

                              <span>Sorry for another rant. Almost everyday I have some a**hole behind me with their high beam on. These motorists do not seem to understand that its super glaring and it will literally blind the person in front when they look into the side mirror. They have it on default. Is there a way to solve this peacefully?

                              <span>I just saw the news about a house collapsing in Saigon and I went down a rabbit hole of houses collapsing when the house next to it starts their construction. Just wondering, is the quality of houses good here? what&#x27;s the reason? is it the skills of the construction worker? old houses in general? Can anyone in construction tell me the process? Do you guys do third party auditing?

                              <span>I’m struggling to choose. The former is obviously much cheaper and I’m struggling to understand how they do both properly in one day for the latter as they’re both quite far away from Saigon and each other. 
 I’m really into history if that’s relevant and seeing the tunnels is a must.

I was standing by a roller coaster taking a picture when I noticed something flying past me and I tried to block it out of my way but cannot recall if I touched it or if it touched me. Later on I saw small things flying in the air that looked like bats but not 100% sure if these were bats as they were pretty small. The locals didn’t seem concerned around them at all. Should I get the vaccine. I checked my skin and didn’t notice any scratches or bites and do not recall actually touching it.

                              <span>Hi, I am planning to move to Vietnam for 3 months starting November. I am in my 30s and US citizen.
 Any recommendations where I should stay?
 I like beaches but don’t want a boring or very touristic neighborhood. Somewhere where I can go to gym, cafes, socialize, work a bit and then go to the beach maybe 20-30 minutes away from home.
 I do not mind a warm rain but I don’t want to end up in the most rainy location. I read that rainy season starts in some areas in November.
 Not a party person but I would prefer an active neighborhood where I can meet new people. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I’ve been following this sub for a little while, and seen a few comments before basically saying “bald white men in their 30s are the worst”. I happen to fall into that category perfectly, and I was considering planning a 2 week trip to go sightseeing next year.
 Is the attitude hostile at all, or will people generally be welcoming while I travel? I’ve never been to Vietnam before, so will be good to know what to expect.

 I&#x27;ll be honest that I&#x27;m not sure what much of it was, but I do know that it contained: shrimp, rice noodles, pork belly, and chilli stuffed with mackerel, something crunchy yet chewy, and also two other types of seafood I can&#x27;t identify. 
 I also have no idea what anything in the other bowls are, but they tasted very refreshing - especially with this lovely green bowl of sauce they bought over shortly after.
 I highly recommend!

                              <span>Disclaimer: I genuinely love kids. I don&#x27;t mean to offend anyone by judging the children, but I&#x27;d like to hear your opinion.
 I usually visit certain coffee shops on the weekends to find new inspiration and refresh my mind. I tend to be more creative in such places. Lately, I&#x27;ve been frequenting The Coffee House due to its spacious and comfortable ambiance for working. However, I&#x27;ve encountered some issues with families that bring their children, typically around 3 to 5 years old. These kids never sit still, always yelling and running around without much supervision from their parents. Moreover, the parents in these families tend to speak loudly, trying to overcome the noise created by their children, and sometimes they reprimand their children when they glance at the kids attempting to break something. This results in a significant amount of chaos, which can be quite anxious. It feels more like a kindergarten than a place for adults.
 I want to emphasize once again that I&#x27;m not passing judgment on the children or their parents. However, from my perspective, it appears that the awareness of some individuals nowadays is somewhat lacking, and this could potentially have a negative impact on their children&#x27;s behavior and attitudes (It is actually occurring now)

                              <span>Perhaps anyone can suggest the right way to deal with requests on cancelling bike rides, like Grab, Gojek, etc? 
 I experience these requests repeatedly &quot;cancel, help me&quot;, while the app might say &quot;you will wait for drivers longer now, because you cancel the rides&quot;. Plus any bonus applied to the ride might not be applied the second time.

                              <span>Hey HCMC adventurers, there&#x27;s a casting call going on today at the clay Acoustic Bar at 6E Ngô Thời Nhiệm, Võ Thị Sáu, Quận 3, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh 72407. I know for a fact that the 1pm singer is very talented, and does her best in front of large audiences. 
 I&#x27;d like to encourage all good and groovy people to attend for fun and support of all the song artists that will be attending. 
 Plus, I&#x27;d like to offer ₫100k to the first 10 people to get a selfie with the 1pm dinner after her performance. Just DM me with the pic, and if it&#x27;s her, then I&#x27;ll write the money over.
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hello, My family and I have Iphone 14s and 15s unlocked. It does not have a sim card slot, it uses Esim. How do I go about getting a phone number that uses esim and buying data plans in Vietnam? and do I have to recharge it daily to use the data/make calls? thanks.

                              <span>I went to Vietnam over the summer and came back to the States craving the mì cay (spicy ramen) they served in my hometown. However, I cannot find the brand in the States, so I&#x27;m looking for some alternatives in the States if anyone knows any. Appreciate it.

                              <span>Is it me or does the alcohol to GDP in Vietnam makes no sense. In HCMC, there cocktails for for 250k (11usd) which is almost the same as prices in the states and as for bottle service it’s about 4.5 mill per bottle ($200usd) I’m wondering how can the locals afford this when their average monthly salary 8-10 mill. Ive been to another 3rd country like colombia which makes total sense $40 usd to $100 a bottle but It makes no sense especially in Saigon. Can someone explain to me?

 What about girls who will only meet if you go the the bar/club they suggest?
 Can&#x27;t seem to find a girl who just wants to go out on a regular date.

                              <span>A few times now I have been offered to drink beer with older Vietnamese men (&amp; Filipino but doesn’t matter for this post).
 Does this happen to anyone else often? How do you handle it? 
 The first time, I said sure (with family members of my partner). It turned into a multiple hour feast and drink till you pass out on the karaoke mic. The only strange part was no common language the entire time. 
 For this, is why I usually try to turn this opportunity down even though i feel so bad for doing so. I’m all for being invited to have some food, but drinking gets crazy with the Vietnamese haha.

                              <span>In the 1980s, when Vietnamese Boat People successfully crossed the border, they flooded refugee camps in Southeast Asia. Ms. Ann An Phuong Nguyen (formerly known as Ann Cusack), a teacher in Australia, was just 20 years old at the time. She followed her conscience, leaving her hometown, family and prosperous life. to go to refugee camps to help Vietnamese refugees who have just escaped the country. During 7 consecutive years of volunteer service, she took care of many refugee children and taught English in refugee camps in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. During VHM&#x27;s Gala program on Sunday, September 17, 2023, the Vietnamese Heritage Museum (VHM) was honored to present Ms. Ann Cusack with the VHM Humanitarian Award, as a special way to respectfully acknowledge her love. Her personal love was demonstrated by her tireless and dedicated service to many Boat People during her years of service in Southeast Asian refugee camps.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been visiting Vietnam for a while and I&#x27;ve noticed that on a lot of places, from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh, a lot of people actually live where they work. I&#x27;m not talking about the small family business though - I&#x27;ve seen that in good hotels, restaurants, etc. I&#x27;ve seen workers working during the day and then going to sleep on the business&#x27; basement or on the building&#x27;s last floor. I&#x27;ve accidentally even gone to the basement of some of these hotels and seen someone living there with a kitchen everything.
 Is this common practice? If yes, why? And is it legal?

                              <span>I’ve noticed that lots of Vietnamese American content that shows up on my feed tends to be of a shallower substance. It’s mostly food and comedy about stereotypes, which isn’t inherently bad but…sometimes it leaves me craving more depth.
 I’ve been lucky enough to learn how to play the đàn nguyệt and be exposed to different styles of traditional Vietnamese music. My favorite by far is nhạc cung đình Huế and ca Huế. I’ll never get over how Lưu thủy kim tiền flows or the swaying of Nữ sinh đồng Khánh (I know this is more recent) set to the accompaniment of traditional instruments.
 I really like profiles like this one and it’d be nice to be more exposed to creators that highlight more diverse perspectives on our culture.

                              <span>I am flying to Vietnam from the Philippines in December. It will be a congress sponsored by an international organization. The international organization has ties with governments within Southeast Asia, and I will be officially representing the Philippines.
 However, I also plan to take advantage of the opportunity to experience Vietnamese culture, including the communist/socialist culture.
 Is it permitted to openly display communist/socialist culture in Vietnam? By communist/socialist culture, I mean an overt display of icons connected to communism. For example, am I allowed to wear the military cap with a red star? Am I allowed to pose with Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s monument with my left fist raised?

                              <span>I told my mother that I&#x27;m gay, but ever since I was born I have longed to become a father, nurturing and protecting a child. But instead of going the traditional route of marrying heterosexual, or partnering with a lesbian couple, I wanna do the better thing of adopting a child. 
 Heck, even if I&#x27;m heterosexual I would still choose to adopt a child. There&#x27;s a lot of children needing a home, if you want a child just adopt them, why create for yourself the trouble of having to deal with weddings, the wife&#x27;s family side and stuff. Beside, you have the time to connect to a kid before deciding you could bond with it or not
 But my mother, told me that I&#x27;m crazy and a non blood-related child could never be loyal to me, and always leave me in the end. I told her that I want to father a child not to have someone to take care of me, but to have the feeling that If I were to pass away, I have done something right with my life. I don&#x27;t know how to explain this, but it&#x27;s like I will live my whole life accumulating money, knowledge and experiences, and it would feel like it&#x27;ll be all for nothing if I won&#x27;t spend all of those things on helping and nurturing someone else. It would feel like my all of those things is wasted somehow
 What do your parents and Vietnamese people around think about child adoption? What do you yourself think about it?

                              <span>Me and my gf are at the same age, around 23. She graduated college, i&#x27;m still studying for 2 more years, she wanted to start a family at least by the age of 25. I know i&#x27;m not good enough to take responsible for such a huge commitment ( i&#x27;m not grown up enough ), not at least until i can provide for myself. We had a lot of arguments that i should accept the fact that she might leave me as she wants the best thing for her. Since then, she changed, the way she loved, the way she talked, everything must be exactly what she wants so she can trust that i&#x27;m good enough to be the one for her. Not until a lot of pressures i&#x27;ve been through recently, even when she is one of the biggest pressure feel, now i cant take it anymore, just want to kill myself sometimes. Not even mentioned of the things she wanted me to become when she won&#x27;t accept me for who i am. I cried so much i start losing sleep, losing hairs,... However, she still cares for me, make me feel comfortable and she points out the best in me.
 What should i do when breaking up with my gf is the best thing for both of us but we love each other so much, i know it, i&#x27;m just too selfish to admit that to let her go...

                              <span>I am from the US and visiting my girlfriend who is a local in Vietnam. I am staying at an airbnb. I had read some things about if we are not married that she could not stay with me. But then read it really isn&#x27;t the law anymore, and as long as she is registered, it will not be a problem. I just wanted to confirm this. I asked her but she said she hadn&#x27;t heard of the law (which is making me think if a local hasn&#x27;t it really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal). Any advice would help.

                              <span>So I only got to spend a week there, and I did a lot of typical tourist activities. I&#x27;m American, but I actually went on vacation visiting from China back in 2019. I had been living in Beijing for a year. Beijing is a tier 1 Chinese city, but the vibe is... depressing. People generally look unhappy and stoic, similar to Soviet style culture I suppose. Chinese are inoffensive in customer service, but just... cold. When I landed in Hanoi, which is supposedly the conservative part of Vietnam, the difference was night and day. Interactions with hotel workers, restaurant workers etc was warm and welcoming. English was spoken widely, which again is total opposite of Beijing. What struck me the most was the energy. You could &quot;feel&quot; the progress in the air, like it was an up place where the best is yet to come. I heard China had a similar vibe in the early 2000s. Contrast with China now tho, which by 2019 had already apexed and was showing clear signs of decline. I stayed at a Hilton in the center of Hanoi and it was buzzing with business travelers. Clearly it&#x27;s a growing hub of activity. I also did a junk boat trip in ha long bay, and the guy on the boat was talking about how better life has gotten in just the last 5 years. From the warm locals, to the food (tho I&#x27;ll be honest Hanoi food wasn&#x27;t that great, but the street food was fun and cheap... heard HCM is the place to go for food), the vibe in the air, Vietnam stole my heart and I can&#x27;t wait to return. I&#x27;ve been to well over a dozen countries and lived in 4 continents. I would absolutely love to spend a year or two in Vietnam as it rapidly transforms and grows it&#x27;s presence on the global stage. I wish you all success, I know life isn&#x27;t easy for all, but as someone who&#x27;s &quot;been around the block&quot;, Vietnam is special. Keep doing what you do.

                              <span>Hello, I would like to gather tips on how to be an effective philanthropist in Vietnam. I am an American Việt Kiều. I would prefer to make philantropic decisions based on data and measurable impact. 
 I’ve heard anecdotal information about issues such as pollution, human trafficking, mental illness, etc. What I hope to do is identify where to prioritize my efforts in order to efficiently contribute toward a cause.
 Thank you.
 Ý định của tôi là tạo ra tác động về một vấn đề xã hội. Ai có thể cho lời khuyên về cách tình nguyện và đóng góp hiệu quả không? tôi là việt kiều mỹ. Tôi muốn đưa ra quyết định dựa trên dữ liệu nếu được. Cám ơn.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m coming to Vietnam in a few weeks and I would really love to see Red-shanked doucs and Gibbons.
 I read online that Red-shanked doucs can be seen on the Son Tra peninsula. Is it only place where I can see them or is there some better place? On the Son Tra peninsula, do I need to take tour guide or can I just walk/drive around. Are there some good spots or hiking trails where to watch them?
 I couldn&#x27;t find much information regarding Gibbons. I know about the gibbon treks in Cat Tien but I read mixed reviews about it. Is there some better place where to see them?(preferably in central/ south Vietnam)
 Thank you.

 I bought a simcard (viettel) at the airport like a week ago and received a lot of messages which I ignored because I can’t read vietnamese.
 However this simcard doesn’t work anymore. I went to a smartphone store but they couldn’t help me out.
 Can someone tell me how to proceed in this case?

                              <span>I am an American and do not speak Vietnamese. I am trying to learn as many useful words and phrases as I can before January but it is a very complicated language! My husband and I want to spend a month in Vietnam but are unsure in which city. Hanoi, Da Nang and HCMC all seem like they would be lovely and great places to visit but I am very worried about being able to communicate. Do many people in these cities speak english? Will people be offended by my having to use google translate? Is it possible to travel to the country and manage without speaking Vietnamese ?
 I greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thank you.

                              <span>Basically I work in a restaurant in Hanoi, whenever a customer take a seat, I&#x27;ll ask them how many people they go with, is it one or two
 I noticed a thing that with middle age customers, like 40 years old and above, when they answered &quot;Một&quot;, a lot of them always aspirated the T, like how you say the sound T in English IPA with a burst of air. Like &quot;Một-tuh&quot; 
 Which is weird because as also a Vietnamese, also living in the North, next to Hanoi only 10km, I personally have rarely ever heard any one pronounced words that way. If I say &quot;Một&quot;, I don&#x27;t aspirate the T, only stop it and hold the T behind my front teeth. It doesn&#x27;t come out ever with a burst of air.
 The only person I could recall also talking like that is a coworker of mine whom I used to work with a long time ago. I forgot where he came from but just not a Hanoian and also came from the North, and he always pronounce T in words like that, aspirating with a burst of air. &quot;Biết rồi&quot;, for example, it&#x27;s like &quot;Biết-tuh rồi&quot;
 Is this common way of pronouncing words with T?

                              <span>I am planning to visit Vietnam during the last week of November and the places I plan to visit are Hanoi, Ha long bay, Da nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and few more. Planning to visit all major touristy places. I’m not coming through any tour package, so I wanted to know how difficult it’ll be to find transport between the cities as a tourist. And also which is the subset of both cheap and relatively fast means of transport to travel in veitnam ?

 Hi everyone, today I&#x27;m going to Prague and I know that there is many Vietnamese people in Czech Republic but I don&#x27;t know how to order in a restaurant. Is it like in the food stall in street in Vietnam? like just say hai Bún bò or maybe you have to follow the local way to do? If so, I don&#x27;t really know how to do in Vietnamese. Also if you happen to know a good Vietnamese restaurant in Prague, let me know :)

                              <span>During the Nanban Trade era between 16th-17th century Japan had a great interest in trading with some Southeast Asian locations due to the Ming attitude toward the sea (the Wokou pirate was a huge issue back then) and the bad relationship between Japan and China during this period.
 However, I checked on the wikipedia and found out Japanese merchants tend to arrive to Dang Trong more than Dang Ngoai for trading even though Japanese merchant ships during this period could extend really far and wide within the Southeast Asian region.
 Was there any major factors behind this?

                              <span>I know a Vietnamese citizen who dropped out of school after grade 5 due to family poverty. They are now an adult and want to get a college degree to unlock more job opportunities. What are their options? Is a High School diploma required for university in Vietnam? Will they need to go back and complete every grade after 5 before they are eligible for university, or is there an equivalent to GEDs in America where they can test out of it? What resources are available for a person in this situation?
 How much time and money should they expect this process to require if they decide to pursue it?

                              <span>The dog owner always cleaned up it&#x27;s mess when walking, the dog didn&#x27;t bark a lot. The neighbor never complained to the (foreign) dog owner, just sneakily murdered it. I&#x27;m very confused by this behaviour as I&#x27;ve never heard of it happening in my country except maybe gangsters threatening someone. Can anyone explain the thought process of someone who would do this to their neighbours?

 Does anyone know how late the ferries run going FROM Cat Ba Island TO Hai Phong? I can only find information going the other way. Or is there a way to get from cat ba island to hai phong in the evening? around 7-8 pm? Can I hire a private boat to bring me in the ferry?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m 22 y.o. game developer from Russia 👋.
 When the war between Russia and Ukraine started, I had to move out. As a remote worker I lived in different countries, but Vietnam is my favourite so I live here already about a year (by visa runs). 
 I really like this country, but my Vietnamese is pretty poor, since I know only about few hundred simple words and phrases. Basic verbs, pronouns, nouns, numbers e.t.c. I planning to stay in Vietnam at least until the end of the war on my homeland. So should I go study Vietnamese courses or something like that? Or it&#x27;s not worth trying since I don&#x27;t work here, and still don&#x27;t have any at least a bit close Vietnamese friends? 
 Maybe it&#x27;s enough just to continue learning passively?

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I hope everyone is having amazing day so far. So long story short, me and my family with a 2 year old daughter will be visiting Vietnam in October. 
 We thought about the idea of going from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh city and visiting other cities on the cost. I’ve read a lot that it’s not recommended to rent a car and drive without a driver since the roads are dangerous. That said, I would like to know if everyone has done any similar trip with a car,buss or a train( couldn’t find this option). 
 We are thinking to spend around 2 weeks going this route hence why the car idea would be the best without a driver. 
 I would highly appreciate anyone experiences and or any tips how to travel to get the most out of the country.
 Moreover, I’m a professional driver/racer and been driving in a very dangerous places before. Thanks everyone!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 19 year old tourist from The Netherlands, in Vietnam. I&#x27;m here on a 30-day tourist visa that ends on October 5th.
 I have been struggling with mental health issues. I quit my marketing job back home and wanted a break to travel, so I booked flights to Vietnam to be here for roughly a month. I arrived in Hanoi on the 6th of this month, and I&#x27;m still here.
 I&#x27;m enjoying your country. I&#x27;m considering to stay, if it is possible.
 Is it?
 I would want/need to get a job. My talent is marketing (specifically English/Dutch content and SEO), and I speak English fluently, my accent however is bad.
 Besides that, I would of course need the needed documentation, like a work visa. I would need housing as well.
 Is this idea feasible or should I stop thinking about it? I just need some honest feedback from someone who knows how this kind of stuff works. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I will be travelling through Vietnam soon, it will be my second time. 
 I have never driven a motorcycle before, and first time just took grab moto taxis. This time though I am with my girlfriend and so would maybe be interested in using a bike, sometimes, instead of taking separate trips or cars. 
 When in HCMC, we have walking distance all we need, and I would not want to use a bike here anyway. 
 But in a place like Da Lat, or maybe Đà Nẵng, or Huế, I wonder if all things considered it would be a good idea. 
  
I do not want any problems with the police, so I am wondering worst case scenario what is the biggest issue we could have, a fine? Or worse? How likely is a stop anyway, I have been in Asia a lot and always see foreigners riding bikes, some with helmets (as we would) and some without (foolish) and never seen anyone have an issue. But I have heard online of issues. 
 How safe would it even be? I will avoid one hundred percent HCMC/Hanoi, but in quieter places will it be better?
 Realistically how hard is it to drive the bikes? I have ridden quads before, and also bicycles (I’d that’s relevant) 
  
It’s just likely that renting a bike in places like da làt to go see some more far away places would be ideal and cost effective. 
 If it is not a good idea though, we will just have to figure out another plan.

                              <span>It’s not just mimicking the ‘terrible’ accent which annoys me, it’s how they make every aspect of their content around that and it’s supposed to be comedic because it’s ‘relatable’? It’s shared traumatic experience? And what, saying things in a broken accent is supposed to automatically be funny? I used to enjoy some of those skits, but geez for how long are they gonna use the same shtick? Do you have any other jokes to offer other than “Du Maaaaa”?

                              <span>Saw a similar post the other day.
 I’ve been living in the US for 15 years after moving from Vietnam in my teenage years. I thought I assimilated myself pretty well: high school athlete, joined a frat in college, got a mid level management job and just recently got married to my college sweetheart. 
 Everything seems to be going well on paper but living in the suburb in a huge metropolis really starts to take a toll on me: the cost of living is insane, our combined income is well into the upper middle class in our area but it barely feels enough. Walking around downtown seeing all these people living in their high rise apartments and having boats right on the shore makes me feel tiny and insignificant. It’s humbling to put it lightly.
 Similar to most Vietnamese who studied abroad like me,…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m teaching in public schools. It&#x27;s a nightmare. They are so uninterested. They have no respect. Their behavior is truly shocking. 
 I give the rules, like a stuck record before every class. I write them each time on the board. I&#x27;ve been nice, tried to reason with them. I&#x27;ve been a completed troll. I&#x27;ve enforced punishments, like making them stand for the duration of the lesson (now we have been told we are not to punish in anyway as learning English is just an &#x27;extra&#x27; class, not important).
 I&#x27;ve explained that their behavior is unacceptable, and when someone is speaking you listen. Especially a teacher. Right after explaining they turn right around to the person behind them, and start talking or playing Uno.
 Then there is the fighting in class. Last week two boys had a full on punch up in the classroom over who got the answer right. 
 The other day I walked into a classroom, and a boy looked at me and said &#x27;what the fuck is this?&#x27; 
 It&#x27;s a fight from beginning to end. How do you cope?

                              <span>When the Soviet Invade Afghanistan, what was Vietnam reaction, and what news did Vietnam hear from the Soviet Afghan war.
 I hear this a lot how that Soviet Afghan War is the Soviet version of the Amercian Vietnam War. Would you say it a good comparison. While the outcomes are super different because one country (Vietnam) is now stable and very good economy, while the other (Afghanistan) is now being ruled by a radical religion group that terrorize its own citizens. 
 However, both countries commit the worst war crimes in though wars, which cause a lot of political backlashed from the international community and their allies:
 USA in Vietnam: Phoenix Program, Tiger Force, Agent Orange, My Lai massacre, Thạnh Mỹ massacre, Thủy Bồ incident, Rape during the Vietnam War, Incident on Hill 192, Sơn Thắng massacre, Operation Speedy Express, Côn Đảo Prison, Phú Quốc Prison, List of bombing campaigns of the Vietnam War, 1963 South Vietnamese coup d&#x27;état, Gulf of Tonkin incident Lie, Operation Barrel Roll, 1970 Cambodian coup d&#x27;état,
 Causalities: 1,326,494–3,447,494 dead (some sources even claim 5 million people died) 
 Soviet Union: Tajbeg Palace assault, Laghman massacre, Padkhwab-e Shana massacre, Baraki Barak massacre, Kulchabat, Bala Karz and Mushkizi massacre, Kunduz massacre, 1980 student protests in Kabul, Rauzdi massacre, 3 Hoot uprising, Report Soviet troops raped Afghan women, 4 SOVIET DESERTERS TELL OF CRUEL AFGHANISTAN WAR, Chemical Warfare (Moscow&#x27;s Poison War), agriculture destruction (The War In Afghanistan: Soviet Strategy and The State of the Resistance), KHAD, 
 Here a very good video: How The Afghans Defeated The Soviet Union
 Causalities: 562,000–2,000,000 killed (Some sources even claim up to 3 million) 
 with 5 million externally displaced and 2 million internally displaced which make around that Approximately 6.5% to 11.5% of Afghanistan lose it population to the soviets.

                              <span>I will be in Danang in two weeks. I had a couple of things planned, such as seeing the marble mountains and doing stuff at Ba Na Hills. I am concerned about the rain however. Is the rain on and off? Or does it just downpour nonstop?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for Vietnamese-speaking local guide (English NOT required) I speak Vietnamese semi-fluently and can 100% understand Vietnamese when spoken with a southern accent (I struggle a bit more with Northern and Hue accents but can probably manage. I can read very poorly but could get by if it was a life or death situation). What would be a good way to find a local guide who can dedicate 2-4 weeks to showing me around the entire country? 
 I feel this would be a good opportunity for a recent grad who wants to practice English (with someone who is fluent in both English and Vietnamese) and to go on a free vacation (with modest base pay ~$500USD for one month and basic essentials like food, lodging, etc.) covered. I would also prefer it if they are a woman (because I am female and would feel more comfortable with another woman) who knows how to drive a car/motorbike and who has experience traveling in VN. Am I being unreasonable/ too demanding?
 If it isn&#x27;t clear, I am asking here because I feel most of the options I see are group tours geared towards tourists who have 0 understanding of Vietnamese language and culture and rely purely on English-speaking guides and tours. I don&#x27;t really want to do these tours because they seem waay overpriced and limit what you can see or do based on availability of English-speakers. They also seem to cater to a western audience and I am not interested in that.

                              <span>I&#x27;m 26yo, and I recently visited Vietnam for the 2nd year in a row and this time for 4 months (3 visa runs). I&#x27;m now back in my home country and I&#x27;m really interested in living in Vietnam long term. I&#x27;ve looked at the visa options and job opportunities and I don&#x27;t have a degree so the visa option I&#x27;m most interested in is the Investor Visa, invest 130k usd into an existing business in Vietnam or I can open a franchise like 7/11, GS25, Family Mart etc. I would not have to run it but it would be an Absentee Owner business, which I&#x27;ve read is very common in Vietnam and then I could get a 1 year Investor visa which can be renewed 5 times (5 years). It would be something for 2-3 years from now, so I can increase my income potential to be able to have the capital to be a foreign investor.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving there after the next Tet holiday. Until then I have to save some money. 
 I don&#x27;t have any college degree, probably just making some minimum wage. The only reason I wanna move is because I&#x27;m gay and the gay community is much larger there. I feel like I belong there instead of Hanoi where I&#x27;m living right now because of that
 But I have no specialized skill, with little money, which district is cheaper to live in Saigon?

                              <span>I have been working in Vietnam for 4 years. And I always find it baffling how I am treated by Vietnamese employers, am I the only one? 1. Many don’t like face to face confrontation or honest conversations… 2. Many never tell the truth, but always go around in circles to lie and you have to decipher what is true and what isn’t. 3. Never straightforward and honest. 4. Always the last person to find out anything even when it’s been planned for weeks, you will get told on the day or the day before or not Al all.

                              <span>Just overheard an older lady send back ice because she couldn’t get a clear answer if it was made with filtered water or not and it got me curious if using filtered is standardised these days, even for small street stalls. 
 I’ve had all sorts of drinks and ice from nice cafes and restaurants to bars and random off street hawkers with no major issue so far. 
 Do I have a reason to feel smug about having a strong stomach or have I just been lucky?

                              <span>So i work for a VNese company remotely, all was fine until a Hanoi-an guy joined the team.
 That guy has such bossy attitude and acts like the manager, he is younger but act like he is more experienced and like my all years of experience is nothing.
 We had a Hanoi-an lady work with us too, seemed not friendly or helpful at all. I thought maybe its a female thing.
 Lately i have noticed Hanoians have some major issue with southern and expats. He has the mindset hanoi team is far better , i mean fuck you bro, i taught you soo much as mentor and you act like this.
 I am even an year older than him, i always thought VN respect elders
 I told the guy to F-off, as an expat remote female employee i was very shocked and hurt by his behavior.
 Strange jealousy or acting like no one is better than him.
 So are Northern very cold towards expats? Its my bad luck, i met the wrong one 😔 😭

                              <span>Just generally wondering as a foreigner if it’s common across most Vietnamese.
 I started a small food business just recently and even as a foreigner of Chinese descent (not buddhist or taoist though), I feel some Vietnamese people seem to take superstitions quite seriously, some of which is trying to say if something “unlucky” happens, it is a good sign for something lucky to come.
 Some examples: 1. Hitting the table or something metallic hardly - will bring in customers 2. Accidentally breaking glass - good sign for attracting customers 3. Raining on opening day (especially if it’s right after you done opening day prayers) - business will flourish
 What are some others you have heard?

                              <span>I got into a scuffle the other day with a guard demanding 20k VND tip for supposedly &quot;guarding&quot; my car.
 Just a quick run through, I parked my car in front of an abandoned empty lot on a quiet Sunday morning and had this guard running from the opposite street (not even opposite, more like a few shops down from directly opposite my car), trying to squeeze in a &quot;service&quot; of opening my car door for me. This same dude then demanded 20K VND as &quot;tip&quot; or &quot;fee&quot; for helping me guard my car. I of course said no because I didn&#x27;t think he deserved it or that he actually owned that spot. He then proceeded to knock heavily on my window and shouted &quot;I watched your car for you, so the fee is 20k!&quot; - Translated by my Vietnamese girlfriend.
 Keep in mind that I&#x27;m not a fan of tipping , and if I must, I believe a tip should be reserved for those who actually deserve it, not a random guy sitting by the corner of the street insisting that he did me a service, like I can&#x27;t open my own car door. Do you guys think this expectation has been terribly manifested by the tipping culture from overseas, and has now deemed as appropriate? or am I just a bad person? Also, not sure why bikes aren&#x27;t subjected to tips but only cars? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all!
 I’m an American currently on a long term travel adventure and I’ve been bouncing all around Europe for a couple of months. I’m planning to head to Vietnam for the first time in a few weeks and I’m looking for a place where I can chill out for a while and truly get to know the culture and people.
 My research has pointed me at Hoi An, but I know it’s quite touristy. That’s ok, as long as I can see some culture as well.
 Some thoughts about what I’m looking for:
  
Smaller city or town is preferred. I’ve been in the massive cities in Europe and I’m ready for a slower pace for a while.
 I speak absolutely no Vietnamese. I have no qualms about using google translate, but I want to visit a place where that wouldn’t be viewed as a negative thing. In other words, someplace tourist friendly, even if it isn’t touristy.
 I tend to love seeing museums and historical sites when I travel, so someplace where at least some of that is available.
 I’m not a digital nomad, but decent internet so I can keep in touch with family and friends would be nice.
 Near a beach, even for day trips would be cool, but in no way a requirement.
  
Any suggestions? Is someplace like Hoi An/Da Nang my best option?
 I appreciate any help or tips!

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;m from India and I&#x27;m visiting Vietnam this Nov (so excited!!!). And I&#x27;m gonna meet a few locals there that I know. 
 I want to gift them something. Currently, thinking of handcraft items that are locally made in India. But would love to know what Vietnam people like... And any suggestions? 
 The people I&#x27;m gonna meet are 30+, mostly females and a few males. 
 Thanks to advance 🙏

                              <span>I am of Vietnamese origin but I have been living abroad in Europe. I am currently in Vietnam for three weeks visiting my relatives. 
 The richer part of my family living in Vietnam really wants me to move back to Vietnam and tries to find all ways possible to persuade me, one of the being the rapid improvement of life and presence of many money-making opportunities thanks to the growing economy. 
 It is true that in the last year or two I have ocassionally seen and heard some news about Vietnam&#x27;s rapid development and its increasing direct foreign investment from other countries. The successful relatives really talk nice about the local life and how much better it is from Europe. They have showed me some of the nice places for richer people (I guess only really expensive for locals but affordable for foreigners). 
 Visiting Vietnam I have also seen myself that there has been improvement in Vietnamese infrastructure and services for example. However, I cannot really judge the real situation based on a three-week holiday, neither can I fully rely on my relative&#x27;s point of view since they don&#x27;t have the full knowledge of Europe either and their opinions might be biased.
 I need to have an objective perspective to compare it since I am biased too. How does a real life look like in Vietnam for a (upper) middle class? How would you rate your curent situation, would you move abroad if you could? How good are the international opportunities? As local, what are the things you like and dislike about the Vietnam compared to other countries?

                              <span>I’ve been studying overseas in Canada for more than seven years now so I have no clue what it’s like back in Vietnam’s school culture. 
 According to one of my cousins who has went through middle and highschool though, it is said that they fight… alot. Is this true? and just how brutal are these fights? Like is it just one on one wrestling or full blown gang brawls? I want numbers so I’ll just put a poll up

                              <span>Xin chào! I apologize that I&#x27;m not fluent in Vietnamese, so this post will mainly be in English.
 My mother was born and raised in Vietnam, but immigrated to the US and had me there.
 Today we saw a praying mantis, and my mother talked about how when she grew up in Vietnam, the older people in her town would chew betel nut and put the paste on praying mantises. She mentioned the reasoning behind this practice as that the older people think the praying mantis likes it too.
 This was very surprising and confusing for me, and I tried searching in Google (in English) about this custom. I can find plenty of sources about betel nut chewing in Vietnam, but nothing in particular about putting the paste on praying mantises.
 I don&#x27;t think my mother was joking when she mentioned this, but I just want to hear some verification from other Vietnamese people about this custom. For additional context, she grew up in Phan Rang in Ninh Thuận.

                              <span>I’ve lived in Hanoi for over a year now, I’m going back to England for Christmas this time. I’d like to surprise my loved ones with gifts from Vietnam, what gifts would you recommend? It would be best if they are easily portable, good value and quality, targeted at either gender. Also, the whole point is that the gifts will be authentic and can only be found in Asia. 
 I’ve always struggled to think of Christmas gifts that are different and surprising. I know sometimes it’s best to just buy the more expensive option and call it a day. But I think this year I would like to give out multiple smaller gifts to bring a variety. I’ve got a few ideas but I’m wondering what other people would think of too. Thanks for all the help :))

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m currently exploring the possibility of manufacturing silicone/tpe based products, and I was wondering if any of you might have some insights or recommendations. I want to emphasize that I&#x27;m looking for legitimate manufacturers.
 Here are some specific details about what I&#x27;m looking for:
  
Tooling: We plan to supply our own tooling, so manufacturers who can work with provided molds and specifications would be ideal. However, we&#x27;re also open to exploring the costs of having tooling made in Vietnam if it makes economic sense.
 Manufacturing Location: While we&#x27;re open to manufacturers outside Vietnam, we&#x27;re particularly interested in understanding the manufacturing landscape within Vietnam itself. If you have knowledge about manufacturers in Vietnam or can recommend any reputable companies, please share your insights.
 Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Our initial requirement is a minimum order quantity of 400 units. If you know of manufacturers that can accommodate this quantity or provide competitive pricing at this scale, we&#x27;d greatly appreciate your suggestions.
 Packaging: We plan to handle the packaging ourselves, so manufacturers who can provide the product without packaging would be preferred.
  
Please keep in mind that this inquiry is for legitimate purposes, and I&#x27;m looking for advice on how to approach this inquiry in a responsible manner.
 Feel free to reply here or send me a private message if you prefer to share information privately. I can also explicitly share images of our products as well. I will also be asking you to provide examples of your work.
 Thank you in advance!
 Best.

Can I safely park it on the side of small street between buildings with locked steering and U lock on back wheel for few hours during the day? Just I don&#x27;t want it to get stolen and my VN gf claims that they will steal it 100% (I don&#x27;t trust her VN knowledge, so I&#x27;m asking here😉)

In fact , its a big reason why I am in Vietnam now. I know life during vacation is different than the actual daily life. But here in this country, I coul relate myself to the people. It&#x27;s not an alien country where everything looks so different. Here I see problems in daily life. I see 5 yr old little girls selling something on the bui vien street. This is heartbreaking. But that&#x27;s the truth. I saw crazy traffic and pollution. Couple of accidents in HCM. Well, feels like India to me. The war museum was absolutely wonderful, shocking, terrifying. Spent around 4 hrs in the museum. Multiple times just cried seeing the photos of agent orange. Agai…</span>

                              <span>This is probably controversial but f it. I’m (31F) solo traveling throughout Vietnam now. First I went to see family in HCM, then I began my solo journey to Hoi An and Da Nang. No issues in either place. but I’ve been in Hanoi since Saturday and walking around I’m noticing a lot of harassment from south Asian tourists . Yesterday I was in Ha Long Bay at the beach and this guy started taking photos of me. Then he came up to me and asked if he could take photos with me, I said no. Another tourist came banging on my hotel door last night on the cruise which scared the crap out of me. I told him to go away. Today I’m back in Hanoi just walking around in the old quarter and a group of them started to stare at me like I was prey. I quickly grabbed my dinner and went back to my hotel.
 I have no issues with south Asians, I have a lot of South Asian friends in the states and also work with them. They are the kindest people. They do not act like this. I just never experienced harassment from like this and it’s kind of bummer it’s happening IN Vietnam. I’m terrified to go out alone now and will probably being taking Grab everywhere for the duration of my stay even if it’s less than 10 minutes away

                              <span>I was born and raised in Vietnam, moved to the states when I was 13. I’m now in my late 20s and have a full time remote job with good pay/benefits. I went back to vietnam about a week ago to attend my cousins weddings and have had so much fun. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m on vacation but I’ve seen Vietnamese people way more relax and not uptight like Americans. Breakfast and cafe in the morning will thousands of options, my cousin here in Vietnam is a freelance video editor and he works whenever and wherever he wants, around noon all the vendors close for a nap time, and at night eat out (again with thousands of options).
 Meanwhile, I work 9-5 in the states with 30mins lunch time but sometimes I eat at my desk. After work, I have to go to the grocery stores or the gym and sometimes too tired to even cook. Weekends I have to do chores and again grocery. It just feels like time is shorter in the states.
 Everything is getting more expensive in the states so my 75k a year salary doesn’t seem much. My fiancé is a teacher so her job is pretty demanding too. 
 I just feel like people in Vietnam just have more what we call ‘freedom’ the U.S has been advertising. I’ve been considering moving back to vietnam for the past few days if I can work remote and my fiancé can teach English but my parents have properties in the states and they have sacrificed so much so I can have the “best” life in America…just some thoughts
 Edit: just to clarify since some people are triggered because I use the word “freedom” what I meant is it just seem that the lifestyle and work style in Vietnam is more relax compared to America but I do understand that I’m here on vacation so people take off work to hang with me

 Then I walked around the corner and there was about 30 staff lined up on opposite sides of aisle.
 Then I had to walk through them.
 Then they all clapped and bowed
 Does this happen every morning ? Is it an opening morning thing ?

                              <span>My family is Vietnamese, but both my grandparents and parents grew up in France or New Zealand. I was born and grew up in New Zealand. I’ve been to Vietnam before, and even though I can speak to my family, no one in Vietnam could really understand me and kinda mocked me, haha. I want to travel solo to Vietnam but am concerned about making friends. 1. I don’t speak Vietnamese, so it might be hard to make Vietnamese friends. 2. I don’t look like a foreigner, so it might be hard to make foreigner friends. So I’m just looking for tips and advice on meeting people both local and foreigner. TIA

                              <span>I looked online and the only source I could find on the topic was from Quora. They mentioned that the offers are from Grab’s allotted budget for promotions and therefore Grab drivers receive the same amount regardless of discounts applied.
 However, when I booked a Grab ride with the discount, the driver mentioned that he didn’t realize it was a discounted ride and now he’ll receive less than he initially expected. He said that discounted rides means he gets paid less.
 So, how do payments work for discounted rides? I was under the assumption of the first scenario which was why I used offers in the first place.

 But my friends told me that it&#x27;s illegal to use such a weak-engine bike to use on highways, that by law 50cc bikes are not allowed on them. And I&#x27;m pretty sure in order to get to Ha Long, I have to be one some highways. Is it illegal to use them on highways? 
 Or is it even possible to go that far with them, since my bike allows only to drive 50 km/h max. It might take long, and my bike might break down if driven at the maximum limit speed for long hours

I&#x27;m new to this subreddit so pardon me for not knowing how to approach this subject but.. my 19 year old cousin has been alone in Vietnam for a little over a year now. Her final parent, my aunt died a little over a year ago. She&#x27;s a native citizen from Vietnam. I was wondering if my family has any options of bringing her over to the US to live with us? If this is possible I was hoping someone might know the process and the steps required as she is family and we don&#x27;t want her by herself in Vietnam.

                              <span>So! It&#x27;s officially been one month since I moved to Vietnam from America. So far, I&#x27;m really liking the country- even though I know I have plenty of room to grow and get to know it better. Given this, I wanted to ask some more trivial questions and provide some general comments as an adjusting newcomer.
  
Are measuring cups in cooking not a thing here? None of the stores I&#x27;ve found that have kitchen appliances carry them- even the more specialized ones at Aeon Mall.
 Having witnessed the car-clogged streets of Manhattan, I find the constant flow of motorbikes pretty refreshing (even if I&#x27;m terrified to ride one in Ho Chi Minh City).
 I&#x27;ve visited a few Buddhist temples and seen some shrines around, and they often have food in them like apples, kumquats, etc. Is this food for anyone, or does it serve a specific purpose? I don&#x27;t want to take when I&#x27;m not supposed to. EDIT: Answered! I will not take that food.
 I&#x27;m still bemused by how frequently I see Lotso Bear. He seems to be pretty popular independent of Toy Story, and I&#x27;m not quite sure why.
 I hear that avoiding eye contact is generally used when Vietnamese people are frustrated, since they want to avoid direct confrontation. I&#x27;ve always struggled with eye contact (I&#x27;m on the autism spectrum), so would Vietnamese people read that as a sign of anger or hostility?
  
God knows, I have plenty more thoughts, but I&#x27;ve worked through a lot of those with some of my friends. Thank you in advance for your input. I&#x27;m happy to be here.

                              <span>Im currently in Hanoi with my vietnamese GF. Were from Germany and are here for 5 days before we leave for South Korea, then Japan and after that to Saigon.
 My gf wants to go to Phu Quoc as she really wants to be at a nice beach whereas i want to go to Bangkok as the weather is way too hot and humid for me to enjoy it in Phu Quoc and i would stay mostly inside in Bangkok. Also i heard from alot of friends and people living in Vietnam that Phu Quoc will be 50% rain at the time we would go there (16th Oct). Also i think the remaining time we have would be too long for a trip to phu quoc (1 Week).
 What would you guys recommend? Is there maybe a nice beach not too far from Bangkok?
 Thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>Mình có một anh bạn trai kém tuổi. Tụi mình yêu nhau đã được 1 năm, thời gian yêu nhau mình biết ảnh không có kinh tế nên hỗ trợ ảnh rất nhiều. Cụ thể là tiền thuê nhà, chi phí sinh hoạt, ăn uống hàng ngày mình đều lo cho ảnh mỗi ngày kể từ khi yêu nhau. Ảnh thì đi xin việc ở đâu cũng bị từ chối do có hình xăm nên tính ra từ khi mới yêu ảnh mới đi làm khoảng 3 tháng (không liền nhau). Thời gian còn lại lúc nào cũng kè kè bên mình. Mình luôn động viên ảnh và chỉ yêu cầu ảnh hỗ trợ mình làm 1 vài việc chân tay. Ảnh có cơ thể khá yếu nên hay kêu mệt mỏi với mình, nhiều lúc ốm mình cũng đưa ảnh đi viện để truyền và mua thuốc cho ảnh. Thật sự với mình như vậy là mình quá cảm thông cho ảnh rồi. Nhưng cho đến hôm trước mình như tức nước vỡ bờ. Ảnh mới kiếm được 1 công việc phục vụ 5 tiếng 1 ngày thì tối ảnh tan ca qua đón mình. Đó là ngày thứ 3 anh đi làm. Như mọi hôm mình đưa anh qua cửa hàng tiện lợi mua mì và nước cho ảnh hồi sức. Sau đó bọn mình có chơi game 1 lúc rồi lại về nhà mình ăn cơm và xem phim, sau đó mình cũng gọi nước sinh tố về cho anh bồi bổ. Ăn xong mình chỉ nhờ ảnh rửa bát, lúc mình bảo thì ảnh không nói gì với mình mà cứ lẳng lặng đi làm. Nhưng lúc rửa bát thì ảnh bắt đầu khó chịu với mình và nói mình không biết thông cảm cho anh đi làm cả ngày mệt và tụi mình cãi nhau. Ảnh nói từ nay ảnh không qua ăn cơm là được nhưng suốt 1 năm qua ngày nào ảnh cũng qua ăn. Mình biết tiền không phải thước đo nhưng để làm ra tiền thì mình cũng phải mất công sức và trí tuệ nên với mình đó là tấm lòng của mình. Như vậy là mình chưa thông cảm cho ảnh phải không?

I&#x27;m on the asexual spectrum and basically never even been in a relationship and when I do date it&#x27;s usually other guys so I never know what to say and I don&#x27;t wanna just go pê đê 😂 also where I am from it&#x27;s completely normal to not be married at 30 most young people don&#x27;t even wanna get married at 40 these days. I tried to tell this Vietnamese lady I don&#x27;t want to get married and she gave me the weirdest look 😂 what&#x27;s a good reply to this kind of questions that won&#x27;t make everyone uncomfortable?

                              <span>I had a fun conversation with a Vietnamese friend regarding Vietnamese swears. We gone through most of everything. But they kept teasing me about this one word that they refuse to tell me for months, no matter how much I begged.
 They told me it’s so bad they will never teach it to me. It’s apparently a really old slang and you need to be local local to know, hard to find on Google as well, It’s just as bad if not worse than N-word with hard r. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY’RE REFERRING TO?
 Update: It&#x27;s an old slang for natives, it&#x27;s used for females specifically. &quot;Lẹo cái&quot; seems to be the closest one but it&#x27;s not complete. It&#x27;s a banned word on google, my friend&#x27;s only seen one text that had it written but it&#x27;s been banned since. And that this generation might not know it.

                              <span>I want to find a Vietnamese song I listen to during my childhood. If you could even point me towards the artist that would be really helpful. I listen to this song back in like 2009 so this song was either created in 2009 or even before. But in the song there was like 3 guy(don’t know if they were brothers or friends) but they were flirting with this one girl. I guess it’s kind of like a love song but more gear towards a younger audience. I remember in the music video the artist rode a bike 😂. Finally the 3 guys made a lot of songs together. Don’t know if they were individual artist working together or they were an actual music group that only made music together. Also it was a pretty common/popular group I believe.

                              <span>I thought about renting a bike in Ho Chi Minh and driving to Hanoi but I only have 3 weeks in Vietnam so instead I’ll get a sleeper train to Da Nang. I’m then planning to rent one there and drive up to Hanoi during 10 days. I know there are companies who do one-way rental for the Hai Van Pass but are there any that do the same until Hanoi?

 Can someone explain what these studios include? Or do I️ need to hire makeup, bring clothes, and everything else separately?
 Any advice is welcome!

I’m 20 so I’m not sure how common it is for people in Vietnam to start dating but I’m from Europe so I’m busy studying etc.

                              <span>Hello, I was watching a soccer game this evening, and I noticed something concerning. The commentator, who is also a host for this streaming service, had around 250k people watching live. In the chat section, a user named &quot;Bắn Hoả Tiễn&quot; said something inappropriate, and in response, the commentator displayed the message &quot;Bắn Hoả Tiễn is a dog&quot; on the screen for all 250k viewers to see. I&#x27;m wondering why some individuals still resort to comparing others to dogs as a means of humiliating those they dislike?

                              <span>Why would my Vn sister-in-law do this?
 And her behaviour is really pissing me off.
 SIL asked if I wanted Ca Phe Sua Da?
 &quot;Good idea&quot;.
 She buys 2 x Ca Phe Sua Da&#x27;s. 1 for me. 1 for her. 
 I did not offer to pay. She has good job by Vn standards. Maybe that was a mistake on my side?
 But be aware I am the main banker whenever any family get-togethers occur. I pay. And they ignore me. Situation normal.
 So it felt an improvement when member of family actually thinking about me!
 I liked my Ca Phe Sua Da so much I decide to buy another one.
 I ask my SIL if she would like another Ca Phe Sua Da?
 &quot;No&quot;.
 So I order 2 more Ca Phe Sua Da&#x27;s. 1 for me and 1 for BF of SIL. ( I&#x27;m thinking of others am I not? He had no idea).
 I ask my SIL how much did the Ca Phe Sua Da man charge?
 &quot;VND15k each. So VND30k&quot;.
 I give the guy VND30k. 
 This is where I was caught by surprise.......
 The Ca Phe Sua Da man obviously thought I had given him too much and went to put his hand in his pocket trying to say ( my Viet ain&#x27;t so hot) VND25k.
 I was surprised because SIL had been very clear I would need pay VND30k.
 The amount of money is not the issue.
 What is the issue is SIL then speaks to the guy in Tieng Viet and tells him &quot; Just take the VND30k. No need for change&quot;.
 She did not look at me. In fact she was looking away from me and the guy and at her mobile as if I would not hear and would not understand.
 He took his hand out of his pocket and tried to thank somebody and was not too sure who to look at; me or SIL. 
 So he kept his VND30k. 
 And why not! It was a very good Ca Phe Sua Da!
 The question I have is why SIL felt it necessary for foreign BIL to pay more than she did?
 Members of family frequently try to stiff me - i get the feeling they think I&#x27;m stoopid because I&#x27;m a foreigner and do not speak Tieng Viet and must therefore pay for them AND pay more.
 Hardly the behaviour of a loving family.
 What is driving this behaviour?

                              <span>I told this story once in r/Vozforum but they deleted it for no reason,
 My relationship with my mother is getting worse and worse everyday. She&#x27;s demanding that I give her half of my salary, my salary is only 6 mil. She said that she&#x27;s getting old and sick and as a child I have to give her my money,
 I refused, telling her at this age I need money for my goal and personal growth. And she kept guilt-tripping me telling she will get old and sick, I&#x27;m so fed up I told her that
 &quot;You kept telling me that you&#x27;re getting old and sick, but ever since the day you came back, what has you done for my health? Has you saved at least one penny in case my health would go bad?&quot;
 I should&#x27;ve moved out earlier, it&#x27;s just a part of me naively thinking that she and I could mend it back

                              <span>I&#x27;m living in Hanoi, having grown up in Bac Ninh. I heard that most people use &quot;Mày&quot;, and &quot;Tao&quot; to refer to their friends and themselves to their friends, as it&#x27;s an sign of being intimate and close and comfortable enough with them
 I personally don&#x27;t like those two pronouns and don&#x27;t use them much often, I think it could come out quite harsh some times, there&#x27;s a reason most people don&#x27;t use it with strangers. But there&#x27;re people in the North assume it&#x27;s the default way to call people no matter how close or distant you are, and I hate them so much, it sounds so rude if you and I aren&#x27;t that close
 With my best friends and friends, I use their personal names/tôi or tao if extremely close. Ông/Tôi and Personal names/Personal names. 
 The rare cases I use &quot;Mày&quot; and &quot;Tao&quot; with my friends are when I&#x27;m trying to make a comedy skit or purpousfully acting theatrically with them.

Mình không nghĩ là 2 năm cố gắng mà bây giờ cô ấy lại trở nên vậy , có cách nào giải quyết khiến kí ức hồi xưa trở về khiến cả 2 trân trọng nhau hơn không ạ?

I didn’t have a serving bowl large enough for all my noodles and broth so I just filled the red bowl up twice. I’m happy with how it tasted but trying to make the portions right is hard for me with the amount of broth/noodles for just 1 person. Anyway thanks for this dish Vietnam.

 Let me start by saying that I am asking this question to gain knowledge and understanding and not to attract trolls or to troll. (Although this kind of topic will inevitably do that) I am a foreigner who has lived in Viet Nam for around 4 years and currently work as an English teacher at a language center.
 I have noticed that SOME of my teenage students seem to celebrate and venerate the Nazi regime and Hitler himself, with some of them showing me Nazi salutes in what I assume is &quot;humor&quot;, one student has played the Nazi anthem on his phone (I didn&#x27;t know what it was until he told me) and placed his hand on his heart, and some of my students have told me that they look up to him and have proudly told me things like &quot;I&#x27;m the biggest racist&quot;.

                              <span>Me and my husband are on our honeymoon. We&#x27;ve been in Bali for a week and last night we arrived in Da Nang (EDIT: sorry, we&#x27;re actually in Hoi An, we flew into Da Nang! Arrived very late, so I wasn&#x27;t sure!) and we&#x27;re here until Saturday. Haven&#x27;t had time to make too many plans yet.
 We love history, architecture, FOOD and wonderful people. 
 We don&#x27;t have a car, so will get taxis etc.
 Please help us make an itinerary.
 Thank you 💞

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I will be traveling to vietnam in march for 20 days. I want to prepare my itinerary in advance which means booking transportation. Which website is the best and most legit to book tickets (mostly train) and also allows to chose which berths i would like? Also; how much in advance should i book them? Any recommendation on where to rent a bike in da nang and ninh binh? Are peony cruises worth the price for an overnight &quot;cruise&quot;? 
 Thank you

 I have been reading inconclusive information about visiting Hoi An in November. Can anyone advise whether it would be wise to avoid visiting Hoi An during November or is it OK?
 Am so excited about this trip!

                              <span>Well, I was learning to drive a bike last year. Generally speaking, I was able to use it. But there was a strong fear that I could kill someone. And that fear paralysed me ultimately, so I have never driven outside parkings :)))) That’s why, generally speaking, I can’t use a bike. Plz recommend the instructor who knows how to work it out and can do that (and teach driving skills for sure :). 
 Humor (much humor) is a great tool that helped me, for example, overcome the same thing in surfing.
 Thanks.
 P.S. I have relevant driver license :D

                              <span>Hi Vietnamese,
 I am a Thai girl who is interested in living in Vietnam.
 The main reason is that I love Vpop and want to learn more about Vietnamese culture. I am obsessed with some big names: Son Tun Mtp, Low G, Quang Hung masterD, Amee, Tlinh, Hoang Thuy Linh,….
 Do you know Vpop is becoming more popular in Thailand? A Vietnamese guy introduced these songs to me ☺️
 There’re many reasons I want to explore Vietnam. Youth is too short to settle down.😎
 I know there is a big difference between north and south parts. My friend says HCM’s vibe is similar to Bangkok, so I choose Hanoi. I want something different. My friend will be in Hanoi soon, so he may help me a lot. And I have at least one person to hang out with
 My main concern is job hunting in Vietnam. I want to work in person with local people, so I can make friends.
 I am living in Montreal, Canada now. I studied abroad here and got a full time job, so I have work experience
 I have a degree in graphics design and diploma in photography. 
 How’s graphics design and photography industries in Vietnam? Any chance for me to get a job at a big studios or simply work as freelancer. I want to work for a professional one. I may send portfolio to potential employers.
 My other option is teaching. I took IELTS exam 2 months ago. My overall band is 7.5. Not bad, but not good enough to be English teacher.
 I have c2 in French and have lived in French speaking environment for a long time. I am thai, but my ancestors are Chinese and British, and I can speak some mandarin. I am thinking about being a French or Thai teacher.
 Do many local people want to learn French or Thai?
 Any suggestions to adapt environment in positive way, job hunting, housing and socializing?
 How do vietnamese think about Thai in general, esp female? I know some stereotypes exist
 I accidentally found this forum while googling “work in Vietnam”. Really want to get some insightful information from you guys.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been wondering about this for a while now...it&#x27;s late 2023, covid will never be totally gone but much of the world has gotten vaccinated and moved on as the severity of the virus has decreased. 
 I don&#x27;t see too many folks on the streets masking these days, but for some reason it seems really common in high schools - I teach IELTS in high schools in Hanoi, and am surprised that sometimes up to half of my students are still masking. I wonder what the reason is - are they really doing it for health protocol? I can&#x27;t imagine teenagers are particularly worried about getting sick at this point right? Do their parents make them? My theory is that a lot of young people wear them because it helps self-conscious teens feel &quot;covered&quot; and secured a little bit. 
 I&#x27;m not an anti-masker, these guys can do what they want - just curious why it seems so much more prevalent than in other countries (to be clear, I&#x27;m talking about students in a classroom wearing it year-long, not wearing it on the road or because they&#x27;re sick.)

                              <span>So I admit that this probably annoys me more than most people but in Vietnam even when I travel by day I am in a sleeper bus.
 It&#x27;s kinda uncomfortable for me to do this. I like to sit up straight and look at the view outside. I don&#x27;t want to lie down during the day.
 Maybe I am going wrong by booking the bus through the hostel? Should i go to the local bus station instead and find a sitting bus?
 Edit: I&#x27;m an idiot and actually found out how to put the seat up now so this improves my mood dramatically lol

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m just beginning to develop my idea of tote bags (felt, canvas, structured and also casual shopping bags) after I got compliments and inquiries on where I got a special tote bag when I visited Vietnam this year.
 I wanted to do some market research to figure out what kind of designs appeal to the public - generally, Vietnamese-Americans and Vietnamese-Canadians but also anyone interested in a small fashion startup with a Vietnamese twist on it.
 Please let me know what sayings on the products would you be interested in most so I can focus on that design first.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Like title says, looking to send a small (3-4 kg) package of clothes/souvenirs/… to EU, more specifically to Brussels, Belgium. 
 Any recommendations which service to use? I would hope to surely keep it below 2.000.000 VND, the duration of the shipping does not matter.
 UPS, FedEx seem to be very expensive, VN Post seems to be unreliable at times… 
 Not sure what to use. Any experiences: I’d love to hear them. TIA

I spend a lot in the country currently I live, how would you say Vietnam life is like? Are most foreigners there to save money and live very cheap or is the quality of life really good?

                              <span>My wifes family thinks that it is very risky to walk alone through less populated areas close to Hanoi, say 10km south of the inner city between those smalls villages. 
 They say the risk is that you get knocked out and then sold to the chinese(??) is that an actual risk? Are there real risks? Is it more or less dangerous as a foreigner?
 I&#x27;m asking because I like to take long walks through nature. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello kind folks! My partner and I are in Hanoi, planning to leave for Sapa soon. There&#x27;s tons of packages at the hostel advertising trekking and homestay packages for $150 Canadian and they include accommodation, food, and sleeper bus to and from Sapa to Hanoi.
 The only problem is every single one I&#x27;ve seen advertised has 12km+ daily hikes. As much as I&#x27;d love to do this, I have a bad hip from past surgery and I think my max would be 5km a day. I don&#x27;t wanna slow the groups down with my frequent rests or end up in a pain crisis in front of others.
 Has anyone heard of some good packages with less hiking for the old and sore travellers like me? Perhaps slow or partial hikes, or rides to villages 😅
 Or should we just buy our own bus to Sapa, find a hostel, and do our own day tours? Any advice? 
 Thank you!!

 My friend and I are looking for the best vegetarian restaurant in Hanoi. Non-Vietnamese, a bit fancy one. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Tôi là Tèo ( biệt danh thôi 😂 ) năm nay 22 tuổi. Cách đây 3 năm, tôi có 1 mối tình khá đẹp cho đến khi tôi bị cắm sừng và rồi tôi đã trả thù người yêu cũ khiến gia đình cô ta tan vỡ. Tôi sẽ gọi nyc là H. Tôi từng rất yêu và trân trọng H ngay cả khi tôi biết bản thân mình bị phản bộ, tôi cũng chỉ chấp nhận trong im lặng. Nhưng đáp lại sự tôn trọng cuối cùng đó cô ta lại lấy tôi ra để làm trò tiêu khiển bên tên khốn kia. Rồi sau vài lần nói chuyện không thể kết thúc tôi đã gửi những bằng chứng về việc bố H ngoại tình cho mẹ H và mẹ cô ta làm ầm lên rồi li hôn. Chưa cảm thấy thỏa mãn, tôi lại khiến bố cô ta bị bắt vì tội tổ chức đánh bạc và phải ngồi tù 4 năm. Sau 1 năm chia tay, tôi nghe được tin từ vài người bạn chung của 2 đứa về việc cuộc sống cô ta khá tồi tệ khi mà bố đang phải thụ án, mẹ nuôi 2 đứa em và cô ta thì cũng khá tệ. Tôi đã không cảm thấy bất kì điều gì khi tôi nghe những điều đó. 
 Đây là câu chuyện thật của bản thân mình nhưng chỉ là vắn tắt, nếu mọi người muốn nghe đầy đủ &quot;từ tình yêu ngọt ngào đến sự trả thù không hề thương xót&quot; hãy cmt cho mình biết.

Now i got a mail saying the 2nd flight from hanoi to osaka is rescheduled to a time before my first flight reaches hanoi. Both vietjet and gotogate arent helping me with this. Also the original flight isnt cancelled. I checked the schedule for that day and it is still running. What can i do in this situation? Will vietjet rebook me on a valid flight?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just moved to Hanoi for a month or 2. After I basically settled down all my things, I&#x27;m starting to explore the city&#x27;s places. I&#x27;ve tried going on walking streets in Ho Guom, and it&#x27;s not really my thing, plus I&#x27;m just going alone, so that just feels awkward. Can you guys suggest some places for me to go, and maybe make some new friends? Any suggestion is appreciated, thank you.

                              <span>Yesterday, I took my first Ielts exam, and it wasn’t going well, I mean I did prepare for it but it was quite hard. In the writing test, I completely rushed in time. The first task is about 4 pie charts, which took me 25 minutes to finish. The second one is “Some people think that good health is very important to every person, so medical service should not be run by profit-making companies. Do the advantages of private health care outweigh the disadvantages?” I was stunned after reading it, but I still tried my best to complete the essay. When it was done, I counted the words and found out that I wrote just only 200 words, while the task requires to write at least 250 words. But I didn’t have time to add more or look over it, I had to handle it because time was up. I feel really bad now. I think I will only get 5 in writing and my parents will kill me, as I just threw their money out the window.

                              <span>My new Vietnamese girlfriend calls me &quot;Bo&quot;. I know that it means daddy/father. We are both in our 30&#x27;s and she is only 2 years younger than me. She said this is common in Vietnam. Is it really common? If so, why? Any other meaning to it?
 EDIT: She is 100% Vietnamese and born and raised in HCMC. I asked her what Bo means and she said &quot;daddy/father&quot;. She often sends me this text: Dạ bố.

                              <span>I will travel to Da Nang soon. And I want to buy some medicine while traveling to Vietnam because I heard that the price of medicine in Vietnam is cheaper. 
 The medicine I want to buy is diabetes medicine. I want to buy Metformin and Dapagliflozin. 
 Can I get Mounjaro or Ozempic, an injection-type diabetes treatment other than oral medicine, at a pharmacy without a prescription? 
 How much does it usually cost?

                              <span>I am going to Vietnam for a month, travelling around the country. I am very excited and lokking forward to it! However, I have read that people (some?) eat dog/cat. I live in a culture where dogs/cats are pets, and I have a cat myself. I know and agree that there is not a moral difference between eating cat and for instance pig or cow, but being a cat owner (and vegetarian) I know it would be very difficult to see dog/cat meat consumption. I therefore want to avoid seeing it or being reminded of it as much as I can.
 I do not know how widespread it is, so I was hoping you could tell me if there are certain areas in Vietnam, places or situations I should avoid when travelling to avoid seeing it? Does anyone have any tips for a sensitive soul?

 in addition, are these products generally affordable (for an american tourist)? i ask because asian beauty products are usually pretty marked up over here.
 thanks in advance!

Because the tour groups are all full for tomorrow. And weekend will be crowded. So I want to avoid the crowd. Also, is the public bus AC - air conditioner ? Else I will just sweat n die in the heat. Thanks.

 My group is arriving in SGN and we are hoping to book a bus to Can Tho. Problem is, I was hoping we can get a bus that pick us up directly from the airport and also drop us off at a specific spot - would that be possible? 
 I&#x27;m looking on 12go but the pick up spot are all bus stations that are an hour walk from the airport. Please suggest any website or company, and any other advice. Thank you!

                              <span>Vietnamese lived in America here. I moved to the US 10 years ago and are on track to become a mental health therapist. It’s a job I really enjoyed as it let me help people but I spontaneously remember about Vietnam and want to ask some questions about my home town. Since my old friend group drifted away and those I’m still in contact with also moved to other countries. Would anyone mind tell me how the field of Mental Health is doing in Vietnam? Any progress for on it? Do you guys still face a lot of issues?

 19 and soon-to-be 20 yr old vnmese. Got sent to Canada since 14th and I hated myself ever since. 
 So back in grade 8th or 2017 my mom was rambling about studying abroad or relocating abroad, ofc me being a stupid 8th grade kid knew nothing. Fast forward to grade 9th and she just randomly said &quot;oh yea ur going abroad next year&quot;, again being a dumb 9th grader who knows nothing more than video games i was happy that i get to be away from my parents. It wasnt really my choice and i had no control over me going abroad but as a dumb kid i found that was to be extremely exciting. 
 Well throughout the years from grade 10th highschool to even 2nd year college I suffered from many states of depression. Language barrier wasnt really a …</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone. As a newcomer to Hanoi I have recently discovered that Taxis are impossible to get when its raining and I have been unable to get to work this morning. Can someone please explain to me, like I am a child, how to use the bus service in Hanoi? What i&#x27;m looking for are things like: Do I need to wave at the bus driver to stop or do they stop at every bus stop? Is there a button to press to tell the bus driver that I am getting off? Is every one way ticket the same price or does the price change depending on distance? Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I speak no Vietnamese other than hello and thank you.

 Em cảm ơn ạ.

                              <span>Strange question. I&#x27;ve been to VN four times. Have a foodie friend traveling through Asia who wanted to visit for a few days and asked me for recommendations. They will be working remote every day but will need to give some live presentations so a strong reliable wifi signal is important. 
 On the flip side, I wanted to recommend a place where they could also walk to local places for food. Originally I wanted to recommend Hoi An for the experience, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust the wifi enough (at least not at the bandwidth they&#x27;d need). Maybe Da Nang but the hotels that I&#x27;d assume would have the best wifi are not near areas that are very walkable and are very touristy. They could visit Hoi An for a half day trip though. Then I was thinking Nha Trang - I remember staying near the water in a modern hotel and could walk down narrow streets to some hidden gems though it was pretty touristy. That was pre-pandemic, maybe they got pushed out...not sure.
 Open to other suggestions (and I&#x27;ll probably add them to my own itinerary next trip)!

                              <span>Usually a Python function passes its results back using a return statement. The problem is that sometimes it can&#x27;t, so you need to figure out a different way to return those results.  This happens, most often, when someone else&#x27;s library&#x27;s interface is in the way, and you can&#x27;t change</span>

 I never have been in an Asia country. Do you have any recommendations around Ho-Chi-Minh-City like jungle, beach and sightseeing? Which district is a good one for tourists?
 Is it easy to move by train or bus to my destinations or is it better to get a taxi/Uber (what will they charge)?!

 Also, other than statistics, has height increased dramatically since Vietnam has started to grow economically? To a level where it is noticeable? 
 This is for part of an economic growth study for school! Thanks!

 Em mình hồi còn nhỏ bị bệnh nặng, tâm lý mong manh, nên gia đình chưa bao giờ áp lực việc học hay áp lực em mình phải giỏi bất cứ thứ gì, ngoại trừ gia đình có đầu tư cho nó học tiếng anh để tốt cho nó nhưng mà thân là chị cả, mình thấy ngán ngẩm mọi người ạ! Nó không chịu học tiếng anh mặc dù mỗi tháng gia đình chi trên 10tr cho nó đi học IELTS, mỗi lần đi học về không thấy nó ôn bài hay luyện tiếng anh gì cả dù band IELTS nó dưới 5.0. Gia đình đầu tư mà mình thấy đổ sông đổ bỏ m*, 10tr mỗi tháng đâu có phải là ít ỏi?!

                              <span>So, this morning I woke up and saw the news about how the concert tickets is so poorly sold is all over the place. Almost every entertainment Facebook pages, from big to small, is running this news. 
 What seems questionable to me is they&#x27;re trying to confuse people between &quot;not selling&quot; and &quot;not sold out&quot;. I assume a concert ticket not sold out after 3 days is pretty normal, but it seems they&#x27;re making it looks like not a sinlge ticket is sold and it&#x27;s the worst show ever. 
 As I don&#x27;t really care much about Vbiz, what exactly happened? Is she really that bad or just she provoked some hidden big media company?

                              <span>I&#x27;m Vietnamese and planning to go under some courses to become a tour guide. It&#x27;s the most suitable career path I could think of right now for myself, for my future. 
 I&#x27;m currently living in Hanoi, which I think is quite convenient, because I feel that tourism is our strength and is quite developed here. I mean, we have the Old Quarters and Ha Long Bay and other fascinating and breath-taking places in all the provinces close and nearby Hanoi. I&#x27;ve always thought that I&#x27;m in the best place in Vietnam if I want to persue tourism as a career path.
 But my heart and soul all lie in Sai Gon. I love Saigon and the fact it&#x27;s more gay-friendly. I&#x27;m gay and have no friends in Hanoi, I mean I do have but in Saigon I have more of my people. I want to join them, be with them, and support each other. Unlike here in Hanoi, all alone. The only thing stopping me from having moved to Saigon a long time ago is the fact that I still think Hanoi is better for persuing Tourism. I&#x27;m currently not on any career path, and I&#x27;m 23 now, It&#x27;s my career, not my social life, that I should pay attention to.
 But I love Saigon, I just don&#x27;t know how the whole tourism is for Saigon. Do I have much chances to grow with tourism, as much as I think I have in Hanoi?

                              <span>The entire reason why he lived the way he did was because he wanted to be humble and plain. He dressed, ate, and lived like an average farmer, he treated everyone as an equal and he also wanted to be treated as an equal by us as well. So why are we treating him like he&#x27;s the God Emperor from 40k. For example, we preserve his corpse in something that is almost like a temple. And yet teachers, parents and practically everyone that i talk to compares him to a god. I&#x27;m not hating on him, I appreciate his efforts in freeing this country. But I&#x27;m confused on why we are treating in the exact opposite way that he wanted to be treated.

                              <span>American here.
 When visiting to my local barnes and noble recently it was obvious from first glance that a lot of media from Asia is popular. My bookstore shelves are stocked to the brim with Japanese, Korean, even Chinese comics and light novels, figurines, the works. Korean and Japanese pop stars fill the music section, easily holding their own against big western pop stars like Gaga and Bieber.
 But aside from some novels in the young adult section of my bookstore written by Vietnamese Americans, or the usual biographies in the history section discussing the war. There&#x27;s not a lot of pop culture made by Vietnamese that&#x27;s popular in the western market as other asian countries. Not a lot of fantasy or horror novels, not a lot of manga, not even the odd pop star. 
 You&#x27;d think with how much has changed in US-Vietnam relations since the war we&#x27;d be seeing more Vietnamese pop culture get exported over here. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Why is that?
 And it&#x27;s not like Americans are biased against Vietnamese culture because of the war or years of action movies. Far from it. Vietnamese Food is very popular in places like Los Angeles and Toronto, but vietnamese pop culture seems to have fallen completely by the wayside.
 So I&#x27;m here to ask for theories on why Vietnamese media isn&#x27;t as big of a thing in the west as the other nations cultures. And also to ask for recommendations on vietnamese books, movies, tv, manga etc. that I might be interested in?

 This is my first post on Reddit community. I’m a fourth year student in university of science and I am also a software engineer but my salary is not good. Yeah I don’t have a lot of money to subcribe lessons to learn the English. My idea is that I will post a story every day. Hopefully you can help me to improve my English.
 Many thanks, Luan.

                              <span>I have been a vegetarian for many years and always enjoy learning about new vegetarian dishes through travel. I visited Vietnam in early September this year and visited Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Da Nang. I will introduce to you some vegetarian dishes that I find strange and delicious for longtime vegetarians like me when traveling:
 1. Veganterian Pho 
 Pho
 Pho is a famous dish in Vietnam and I was quite surprised that this dish has a vegetarian version. I found Pho Chay Nhu restaurant, I will put the Google Map link here: https://goo.gl/maps/u1g84gj5PxVoZ5rS9 so you can easily find it. The restaurant is highly rated on Google, so I stopped by. This vegetarian Pho dish is very frugal because the broth is made entirely from vegetables. The toppings of this dish include tofu, mushrooms, …</span>

                              <span>So i just finished the talking with her family and results were this : I got the call at 7am my time and first i had to ask her if she set me up and her answer was this : Yes I did, i already knew that you were going to marry me i just speed up the process because i don&#x27;t want to waste more time. She jokingly said that i needed to grow a pair of balls. Back with the talk with her parents their idea we agreed that we are going to get married on paper in home country because she will get my passport. So she will be coming next month so we can do the formalities. I would love to do it in a church but thats just not possible. Second talking point was where are we going to live. I told them about my plans but i was immediately shut down. They told me that it&#x27;s better to live the first 2 3 years of the childs life near them, the reasoning here is they want to be involved in the upbringing a little bit and because it&#x27;s their first grandchild. After that they dropped the bomb that they want us to move to Singapore after those 2 3 years. Reasoning for this are plenty but I&#x27;ll list some important ones : they are opening some offices there and they need someone to manage it and my wife is the candidate, better opportunity and it&#x27;s not far away from home. I didn&#x27;t expected this but I call them after i had some time thinking about it. Third was their question of when i will be moving. Told them that if she comes in a month I&#x27;ll need about 4 months to move. Because it takes some time to move your life. Fourth was the naming. Told them that she and me have an agreement that&#x27;s if it&#x27;s boy I&#x27;m naming it and if it&#x27;s a girl she is naming it. My reason here is make continues male and female continues female.

                              <span>I have to go on a business trip to Vietnam with my team of five employees. The Vietnamese company has asked us for a $1,000 &quot;introduction fee,&quot; which appears to be a form of bribery. I&#x27;m concerned and wondering if this is common practice in Vietnam. Should I comply and give them the fee? 
 I have previous experience doing business with Chinese companies, and fortunately, I didn&#x27;t encounter such situations. This is the first time I&#x27;ve come across this issue during my business endeavours. 
 I want to hear your advice. What should I do? Should I give them the fee?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I was reading and it said one of the allowed people is “weak muscles” which I assume means elderly and woman.
  
Who is allowed to use pepper spray? The law only allows certain objects to be equipped with supporting tools, including pepper spray. Accordingly, in Clause 1, Article 55 of the Law on Management and Use of Weapons, Explosives and Support Tools 2017 stipulates that subjects equipped with combat gears include:
  
 
National Army;
 
Militia and self-defense;
 
Coast Guard;
 
Police;
 
Weak muscles;

 Any insight?

 I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re fake? Are there any real hostels in Sa Pa anyone can recommend?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I’m going on a trip in the next few weeks to Indonesia for a month to dive and then heading to Vietnam for a month to travel (planning north to south) I don’t really want to carry my dive gear around with me for the whole month. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on shipping my luggage home or if it would be cheaper to rent a locker in Hanoi and leave it there while I go down south and then fly back up to Hanoi from Ho Chi Minh and fly home from Hanoi? Online it says that shipping a suitcase from Hanoi to the US would be like $400, does that sound about right? Thank you for your help!! :)

 Has anyone here ever heard of the travel/social network Hahalolo? They appear to be planning on merging with a stock company in the United States and was wondering if I should invest!

                              <span>We are traveling to Hanoi on Thursday but couldn’t get any VND without preordering it before last weekend. We read in a few posts that you can exchange it in gold shops, however in most posts they were only talking about USD. Does anyone have experience with exchanging less popular currencies like the SEK? I (from a euro country with a bank account in euros) can withdraw from an ATM without any fees, my partner however would have to pay rather high fees so we are trying to avoid that (he cannot simply transfer to me, it is a really complicated process for him to transfer within Europe with his bank). So we were thinking of simply bringing some Swedish Leonor and exchanging it in Vietnam.
 Edit: my autocorrect changed kronor in the title to Ironie, that wasn’t my intention 😂. It seems however that I cannot edit the title anymore

                              <span>Hoping to ride the Ha Giang Loop with my wife and friend over Christmas. I have been researching the documentation needed and the results are nebulous. I have an American drivers license with motorcycle endorsement M1. So does my wife. My friend only has a drivers license, no motorcycle endorsement.
 This is what is states on: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Vietnam.html
 Because the United States is not a party to the Convention on Road Traffic, international driving permits and U.S. drivers’ licenses are not valid in Vietnam. Foreigners renting vehicles risk fines, prosecution, and/or imprisonment for driving without a Vietnamese license endorsed for the appropriate vehicle. If you wish to drive in Vietnam, contact the Provincial Public Transportation Service of the Vietnamese Department of Communications and Transport to obtain a Vietnamese driver’s license. Note that you may be required to take a medical examination as part of the driver license application process. 
 Can I get away with a International Driving Permit on the Ha Gaing Loop while remaining legal?
 Otherwise, what do I need to get? I would like to avoid bribing government officials.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Vietnamese myself, but I&#x27;m always scared shitless whenever I go out on the streets and saw parents let their kids sit in the front and drive with high speed. 
 It&#x27;s getting close to Mid-autumn festival now, so more and more parents takes their childrens out to have fun and buy them toys. I live near Hàng Mã street and I saw all kind of parents letting their kids standing up in the seat holding toys and latterns, it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re telling their children to have some practice before some circus show. It&#x27;s even scarier sometimes when I saw them carelessly speed up to pass some red lights 
 Childrens that young, if gotten in an accident and hit their head, certainly it&#x27;s going to be fatal, but it&#x27;s actually very rare to see any kids with helmets on

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know about y&#x27;all, I absolutely am annoyed with this kind of disturbance. There is clearly zero necessity for such loud noises for a motorbike to function normally. Those people are narcissistic, egoistic, uneducated individuals who think what they&#x27;re doing is cool, and they&#x27;re purposely doing it to grab other people&#x27;s attention (lack of attention much?). They also ride with super fast speed in sub-urban areas too, which is dangerous for the public&#x27;s safety where many children or elders are on the streets. Most of them are gangster-wannabe guys in their 20s or early 30s. It seems like authorities don&#x27;t do anything to seriously put an end to this, unless in popular, large streets.

                              <span>As the title suggest, why is there so few media and general public awareness about Vietnam&#x27;s intervention during the Khmer Rouge genocidal regime? I will admit I am not a history honor student, but I do remember that there was barely anything about this in the (Vietnamese) history text book. I know the political situation at the time was extremely complex, with all the communist allies infighting, fallout from the end of the Vietnam war and general fear of the Soviets at the time. But the fact that Vietnam pushed all the way to the capital of Cambodia to overthrow one of the most brutal regime in human history, all the while facing pressure not only from the Pro-Chinese countries, but also from the Western Democratic world, is one hell of a tale. Why is it so often forgotten? Link of you want to read about it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War.

 There’s this one also

 I noticed that a lot of them are trying to discredit Vietnam. It seems like a lot of Chinese see the alliance between the US and Vietnam as a threat

                              <span>Hi, my name is Xueru and I&#x27;m from China, but I&#x27;m not ethnically Chinese. My parents are from Taiwan and Vietnam. I have a different name when I live in Vietnam, which is Khanh Huyen. The story I am sharing here happened in 2018, when I first visited Vietnam. I don&#x27;t know how to say it in a way that you guys can understand, but in order to use Reddit, we have to use a VPN, and we nicknamed it &quot;Vietnamese Pho Noodle&quot;. And that&#x27;s right, the reason I wanted to come to Vietnam was because I wanted to try pho.
 After arriving in Hanoi, it was already late, so we decided to leave the sightseeing for the next morning. The next morning, my parents went to do the paperwork for me because we also intend to live in Vietnam. So my mom gave me &quot;500,000 VND&quot; (It was around 150 yuan) to go out and eat wha…</span>

                              <span>She is 23 me also. 
 The story goes like this, for our 4th anniversary we went to Thailand and one night we both got really drunk really drunk and she told me it&#x27;s OK to finish inside. As a monkey i got really excited and did it without thinking of the consequences. Month and half later i get a call with a positive test. I literally froze and the only thing i can think about is getting my shit together. I would like to point out that i don&#x27;t have a look on this situation as my life is over it&#x27;s just a natural progression of life that may happened a little earlier. She told me that she hasn&#x27;t told her parents yet because she wanted to tell me first. We had a serious talk about further progression and when will I move. After the call I immediately talked with my parents because it&#x27;s a serious shift in my life dynamic and because i need to prepare the funds for the move. The mindset of our parents was already pushing us to get married so we don&#x27;t have to worry about family disapproval. The only problem here is the sudden switch in our lives. 
 So i have a couple of questions: What&#x27;s the price of land in Hanoi? Planning on building a house Dual citizenship is it possible for all countries? Asking for the kid Is 5 years maximum for visa exemption? How much will I be paying in taxes? 
 If you have some questions for me ask me in the comment

                              <span>We spent 2 nights in HCMC and not once did a driver try and offer to be our personal driver and exchange contact details.
 We&#x27;ve been in Da Nang half a day now and every single driver has asked us whether they can drive us back to the hotel and offer to hang around wherever we are so that we can use them over Grab.
 Is this expected or some sort of scam? Every time we say Grab has been perfect for us and I&#x27;ve never waited for more than 2 minutes so it&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t trust them but rather I don&#x27;t want to waste their time waiting around for us.
 Writing this as I sit in a Grab whilst the driver is trying to tell us what our plans are coming back tonight on Google Translate.

                              <span>I (24M) am currently in a relationship with my girlfriend (23F). We&#x27;re planning to get married in about 2-3 years once our financial situations improve. Recently, I was chatting with my dad about life in general, and the topic of having kids came up. Personally, I&#x27;m not too concerned about having children. I know I could be a great dad, but I&#x27;d also be perfectly fine without kids. My girlfriend has also hinted that she doesn&#x27;t want children, and I didn&#x27;t push the conversation further because either outcome is okay with me.
 When I shared this with my dad, he didn&#x27;t react well. In fact, he called both of us crazy and said we weren&#x27;t in our right minds. No matter how much I tried to explain our decision, he kept insisting that I&#x27;d change my mind eventually. This really upset me because he wasn&#x27;t respecting our choice and was trying to influence it.
 I can already see this topic coming up again in the future, and I don&#x27;t know how to get through to him. I understand that he&#x27;s getting older and wants grandchildren, which makes it tough because I know how much it would hurt him not to have his own. My older brother is also uncertain about his stance on kids. Any advice on how to handle this?

                              <span>Hi people,
 I&#x27;m Vietnamese Canadian and I have a sweet viet gf. She&#x27;s little older than me, but calls me &quot;em.&quot; often. She rarely or never calls me &quot;anh.&quot; I think it&#x27;s weird but I&#x27;m use to it now...
 I call her &quot;em&quot; or &quot;đai ca&quot; in Vietnamese. Or &quot;baby&quot; or &quot;boo.&quot; in English. 
 Is there a word to call your gf or wife if little older than you? She&#x27;s 3 years older than me, but I love her dearly as there is no age difference.

                              <span>My trip in Vietnam ends today, I was here for 13 days- Saigon, Danang, Hoi an, Phong Nha, Ninh bin, Hanoi
 The experiences that I take back home are something I’ll cherish for life. I have to be honest, I knew very little about the history of vietnam- but as I met people and visited war museum I learned so much. You guys are absolutely amazing, such hardworking, humble, helpful &amp; ambitious people. I am so inspired by you! 🇻🇳
 Special shoutout to all the women in Vietnam, you gave me food at 2AM, helped me with directions &amp; assisted me in heavy rains when my scooter broke down.
 Cảm ơn!

                              <span>Hello,
 We are 2 adults visiting Vietnam this December. We both are foodies and always love to try local cuisine.
 What are some of the local favorite places that we should not miss? We mostly prefer street food or small restaurants but can also visit upscale ones if it is worth it. We also like to try vegetarian food so please recommend if you know any good local vegetarian restaurants. 
 I know that this is a subjective question. But I am trying to see what kind of suggestions I get so I can make the best decision and cover some good spots within the few days we are in Hanoi. 
 Thanks.

 Has anyone done CRBA? How was the experience? Due date is around Christmas. We&#x27;re planning to come back to the US mid March. Would it be enough time for the CRBA to process and issue a newborn passport?
 TIA

The pink book is in my wife&#x27;s name. When she was registering the land for the pink book, they require my consent and signature to complete the purchase. I neeeded a translator to translate the document and signed the form. That was for purchase and my question is if my wife sells the property - Does she need my consent as well to sell the land property?

                              <span>This might be a shot in the dark, but today I was in Ho Chi Minh City and I went to Bao tàng Thânh phô Hô Chi Minh at around 22:00h. There were a group of young guys breakdancing there. One of them was a young vietnamese man with a blach t-shirt and brown pants. He was really handsome and danced really nice. I was wondering if anyone here could help me find him, I would like to ask him out on a date.

 Please give me some tips. I am worried not to get into scam. Worried of falling sick alone in the country. The bana hills look too much crowded to me. Shall I skip it ? What is there to see except the bridge? Between hoi An and danang, where should I book hotel ? Also, is it a good idea to get a bus /train from Saigon to da nang or better to book flight ?

                              <span>Hi, I’m (F21) Vietnamese American and just got back from traveling to Vietnam for a week. I stayed in one hotel the whole trip and ended up getting along really well with the staff. We were all similar age, and I was so happy to become friends with some locals. 
 Yesterday, before I left and checked out of my hotel room, the staff asked if they could take a picture with me to keep as a memory. Since I was in a rush, I forgot to ask them for their contact info/social media and if they could send the picture to me. Now I’m really really regretting it and am sad I won’t be able stay in touch with them or remember their faces in the future…
 Do you think there is any way to reach out to the staff? Should I contact the hotel? Or would that be weird and I should just let it be?

                              <span>Will be traveling to Vietnam soon and part of my trip involves going from HCMC to Can Tho (one way). I&#x27;m hoping to hire a taxi. I looked into grab and it&#x27;s showing about 2000000 dong one way, which is cheaper than what my hotel is quoting me. Can I really just hire a grab for this trip? 
 I know there are cheaper ways (sleeper bus, moped) but I would prefer taxi and possibly making one stop along the way.

                              <span>We thoroughly enjoyed the natural beauty, but unfortunately, the city proved to be a tourist hotspot with limited attractions. The locals were notably less friendly compared to our previous experiences in Vietnam. Additionally, it was disheartening to witness young children, aged 3 to 5, selling souvenirs to tourists on the streets. Would not recommend!

                              <span>There are many Python packages we use to solve our coding problems daily. Take, for instance, the library &quot;Beautiful Soup,&quot; – it doesn&#x27;t come with Python by default and needs to be installed separately.  Many projects rely on libraries and other dependencies, and installing each one can be tedious</span>

 I&#x27;d like to be able to properly say her name correctly but I am having difficultly figuring it out on my own.
 Her name is Xuan. Any tips on how to say this from an English speaking perspective?

                              <span>Hello everyone I am planning on a 3 night, 4 day guided self driving tour around the ha giang loop. I am wondering where travellers put their backpacks? Since the tour stops off at multiple hostels/home stays, do we have to carry our 50-70L backpacks with us on the bikes? 
 Also any recommendation of a hostel to book it with would be greatly appreciated, I am currently leaning towards centra backpackers Hano
 Many thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been close to this vietnamese woman. I&#x27;m 30 she&#x27;s 31. She&#x27;s in a term contract in my laboratory for 1 year. I am an introvert, so does she, and both of us have been single forever. I talk way less than her, and she always talk nonstop with me but not with others. Initially she seems couldn&#x27;t fit in with my other lab members because language barrier, so I tried to setup a trip with international students in our lab to make her comfortable. We ended up going to a lot of trips, but lately it was just only the both of us and mostly it was her idea. 
 We got busier and ended up often having dinner together. From then on I had a crush on her and one day I confess. I was rejected because she want to focus on work and family first, but also because we won&#x27;t be able to meet for that long and she doesn&#x27;t want to have a heartbreak from breakup. Strangely, we became even closer than before. Now only a few weeks before she go back to her old lab in another country, she wants me to spend the last day with her and wants to stay together with me and share a room. I am also from SEA, and I don&#x27;t think this is quite normal, as in sharing a room but not a couple. But she said it is normal in vietnam. Is this true? If you&#x27;re also a woman, I would like to know what do you think of this.
 Edit: Thank you for the replies. I tried to reply, but because this is a new account, the bot wouldn&#x27;t let me unless allowed by the actual mods. I don&#x27;t want to inconvenience the mods each time I want to reply. I am not sure about using my main account. But still, thank you.

                              <span>If I buy a 5mg Diazepam from the pharmacy in Hanoi (no prescription), throw it in my carry-on, then fly to Tokyo for my connecting flight and take it there, am I breaking any Japanese law on psychotropics? I am so confused while reading their website

                              <span>so i&#x27;m a hs student, việt kiều, but i went to live with family in saigon in the summer. since then we&#x27;ve been considering my transferring to an international school there, but it would only be for my final year of hs. we found one that parallels my current education seemingly perfectly; it has the program i&#x27;m in and provides the same diploma and even (supposedly) has the same standards as my current school board. nothing has been worked out or confirmed yet but i just had a few questions. 
 if anyone has been to or heard about both international schools in saigon and hs in north america, how do they compare in terms of education standards? would it be a difficult switch? what is the general student demographic - are there a lot of việt kiều or foreigners? what&#x27;s the student social life/culture like?
 edit: the specific school in mind is CIS (Canadian International School) but at this point we&#x27;ll still consider other options.

                              <span>Today was super busy and there was surprisingly a lot of people joining to draw (at least more than last week i think). This time I get to sit in a garden and it was twice more comfortable to draw than last week in which I had to sit next to a trash can and a sewer.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to know from the locals of VN if you believe pet owners are vaccinating their pets. Such as, are owners more educated about the seriousness of rabies and are spending the money and taking the extra precautions to protect themselves from rabies and strangers from possible harm of rabies infections from their pets? Is vaccinating something you hear being discussed by friends, family or neighbors?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Our family is traveling to Viet Nam at the end of December &amp; we’re wondering for a place to stay for a month. Since we have a baby and ,so looking more like a house or apartment which has 2-3 rooms. Our budget is around $300-400 in Saigon,preferably in Dist 1,3,5 or 6 as we have a relatives nearby those districts. What are your recommendations? Does airbnb work in VN? What are your experiences? TIA.

                              <span>Hey all, I’ll be travelling to Vietnam Sept 20-Oct 19. Haven’t been to Vietnam for 20+yrs.
 I plan to do touristy things and travel all over Vietnam from South-Central-North amongst other fun things.
 I plan to be in Hoi An for the Lantern festival and Da Nang in the end of September to early October; Hanoi-HaLong-NinhBinh around mid October. Otherwise, I’ll be situated in HCM D1.
 How bad is the rainy season? Will the rainy season be so bad that I end up being indoors majority of the travels? 
 Any advice or travel tips are much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, I’m 29F from Philippines and I am seeing this 30M Vietnamese for quite some time now. We are both professional and worked in the same industry. We are getting to know each other and our relationship is good so far. I’ve been to Vietnam few times already and also tried to stay for few weeks. I really like the food and the people, btw :) and he also visited my country. But the only problem is he cannot see the relationship to progress or lead to marriage because I’m from a different country, culture differences and he is thinking how will his family reacts to our relationship etc. Well, on my end there will be no issues as I think Filipino families are more open to this kind of setup. 
 I know for sure that I don’t want to get married, (in near future at least) but of course we also respect and don’t want to waste each other’s time. I do like him and willing to make this relationship to work.
 I just want to ask some insights about this kind or relationship, is it not common or hard to accept in Vietnam? Should I give up? 
 I really appreciate your time reading this. Please be kind in the comment section :)

                              <span>My husband and I have lived here for almost five years and regularly eat street food, so have pretty strong stomachs. However, sometimes we are bested by bad banh mi or xoi. When it (occasionally) strikes I just want loperamide or a similar drug so we can get on with our teaching. But the pharmacists always give me this? What is it actually? 
 I have basic Vietnamese, like ordering food or instructing kids what to do, but no idea when it comes to medical stuff.

                              <span>I currently drive and own a 2003 Honda Future, it was a gift from someone who had a spare bike and after looking on Facebook marketplace out of curiosity I&#x27;m surprised on how much it&#x27;s currently worth.
 For just a few million Vnd more you can get the same style bike (Semi auto underbone) whether it&#x27;s a Honda Wave or Yamaha Sirius.
 Are the Facebook sellers being greedy or is it to do with the &quot;retro&quot; look?

                              <span>In the last hour today I feel I lived in a real life miracle. I was passenger on a motorbike, wife was driving, I dropped my wallet that was in my pants pocket. All my Id are in there, bank cards, the card key for the apartments we are living in. So we try the impossible, going back and forth, looking for my wallet dropped in the street. Phan Xich Long street is crowded, can’t drive back in the same lane, everything seems desperate and futile. We end up driving back till the barber shop I just been before losing the wallet. They went trough a lot of effort helping us, showing us security camera footage of the last hour to check if by any chance I dropped my wallet there. Seem there is nothing more we can do. Suddenly my wife receive a phone call. It was one guy working as security in the street. Thanks to the house card key he found in the wallet he was able to trace back the phone number of my wife. He even makes sure to my wife to show up with me, to avoid a possible landlord to retrieve easy money. Such a thoughtful move. There was my wallet, money untouched. I gave him all I had in the wallet, 2 million dong, and he right away split equally with his partner. I’m happy that this small luck ended up in the hands people in the security, among all others.
 I know how much I was lucky, but still nobody can talk me out of thinking that this could have happen only in this Country. Kudos to all the good people of Vietnam. 🫰

 I (European 35 M) live in Vietnam and work for a Vietnamese company in Vietnam. My company pays tax on my income. However I invest with a European broker in ETF&#x27;s. This is not taxed in Europe because I dont live there. I thought I also dont have to pay tax in Vietnam, but I&#x27;m not sure?

                              <span>I am an amateur bowler, and Bowling is not a popular sport in Vietnam. The funding for Bowling is garbage compared to other sports, and it is why professional bowlers have a hard time locating a good bowling alley for leagues in Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Personally, a good bowling alley must be facilitated with professional-grade equipment (pin setters, scoring system, standard size lanes, balls,...) along with good food/beverage services while being affordable for the young folks. Granted, there may be dozens of bowling alleys popping up on Google, but many of them either lack the qualities mentioned above OR they are closed... permanently. 
 In the past year, I have been to many bowling alleys, and I have come up with a curated list of the goats. I have also ranked them, with the top one being…</span>

                              <span>As I stated in an earlier post I am traveling the country with a good friend of mine, we have had a great time so for, even though there were some things to figure out at first. Now after 2 weeks living with his family we are traveling to the south, he told me to travel ahead so he could visit yet another family. This way he won&#x27;t get bored with my touristy stuff and I dont have to sit around all day not being able to talk to the family.
 When we were with his family we made two trips in total, 1 to sapa and one to Ha Long Bay, both times the Hotel tried to rip us off not wanting to give us the rooms we specifically booked or telling us to cancel our reservation to &quot;check in earlier and get a cheaper price&quot; we never took the offerm. In Person he could talk to the people in vietnamese and would solve the matter easily in a short time. But now I am alone and the scamming and persistencefrom drivers, sellers and hotel stuff only got worse. Today the hotel refused me to let me check in early even though we have agrees on it online and they have said that it would be no problem. Now when I wanted to check in they told me I could only check in if I cancelled the reservation or I would have to wait 2 hours more. I decided to just straight up wait, to not risk being overcharged without an receip showing the confirmed price from booking.com (many people warn you that that would happen if you cancel the reservation )
 This is my first travel alone/with a friend outside of my own country (Germany) and I don&#x27;t know what to do, it is really frustrating. Am I being overprotectiv ? Any tips on how to deal with this better would be much appreciated

                              <span>As the title suggests. But on a side note, I found in central and northern Vietnam the beef is much more tender than in the south. But generally still tough compared to other countries.

                              <span>Help! Aussie Husband and I are currently in HCM before flying to Hoi An (yeah I know we fly into Da Nang). Been to one bar, Chin Chin so far. Fabulous place but omg the music is too loud (can’t hear my husband speak loud because Britney is louder than loud). Is there a gay bar/venue/pub that’s not ear splitting loud and us older Australian gays would be able to sit, drink, talk? Thanks 🙏

                              <span>Hey fellow travelers!
 I am travelling to Veitnam with my GF from 1-9 Oct. Landing in Hanoi and going back home from via Phu Quoc.
 So my Plan is: 1. 4 Days in Hanoi Ha long and Ninh Binh 2. Maybe Hoi an and danang 3. And last 2-3 Days in Phu quoc
 What I am actually confused about is whether my gf and I should go to Hoi an or not as it is monsoon season with risk of flooding. Also our iternary is too tight ;(
 So I wanted your advice on whether we should do Hoi an or visit some place else considering the weather conditions.
 It is our first time in Vietnam so we want to make sure to experience the best.
 Please help 😓 , I am pretty confused about how to do this.

                              <span>Hi I’m planning on visiting Vietnam next year and was just wondering how much I could possibly see in 2 weeks, which order would make this the most efficient, and what time of year would be best.
 I’d love to visit 
 Visit Halong Bay, Cat Ba Island, cave in Phong Nha National Park, War museum, Ban Gioc Waterfall, Golden Hands Bridge, And the Ha Giang Loop
 Is there anything else you would consider a “must see” or anything that’s not really worth it ?

                              <span>Hi all, I will be on vacation to Hanoi soon, and I am wondering how the weather is like there. I know it is quite warm, seen from weather forecast. What do people usually wear in such weather? 
 Also, what is the average price of food in Hanoi? What are some things I should look out for (food poisoning, for example)? 
 Thank you

                              <span>Hello! My friend and I are traveling to Vietnam in January for 14 days. We are very torn on what cities to travel too and want to able too explore as much as we can. We also are doing research on the country before we go, but any tips would be very appreciated. We have some cities in mind but would like to get opinions from people who have actually been to Vietnam!

                              <span>As a gay man myself, everyone, every person I know no matter gay or straight both tell me that one day I should move out of here to Saigon, and it&#x27;s better for me there. 
 I&#x27;ve heard of this so much in my life that I considered it to be true. So I decided to visit Saigon once and twice, and I do believe they&#x27;re right. I can&#x27;t speak for the every Saigonese, I know that even for the most progressive cities, there would be people who have problems with gay people. 
 But I saw much much much more gay couples walking on the street compared to here in Hanoi. At the last firework show at the countdown thing for lunar new year, I could witness at least 6 gay couples within my eye view, some holding hand and some even had their heads on the other&#x27;s shoulder, and honestly nobody really gave a shit. …</span>

 Just wanted to post here to express how much I fucking adore this place, and random observations i have made. There are some issues and I&#x27;ll post about problems as well, but I really like Vietnam a lot.
 I&#x27;m not just some backpacker. I really did my homework on this place before coming here. It has allowed me to integrate here way faster than most people. In the space of a few days I bought a motor bike and started renting an apartment.
 I&#x27;m an English teacher (obvious I guess) and my salary is higher than many locals so I guess that clouds my perceptions of this place a little bit.
 Everything here is so much cheaper than back home. The west is stagnating and many millennials are financially fucked. Out here its possible to actually hustle ahead rather…</span>

I also think that our music has always been more towards ballads and slower songs, so I don&#x27;t know Hoàng Thùy Linh would be a suitable representative

                              <span>Hey first time traveling to Vietnam and all I can say is that it’s been a blast loving the food but I want to go explore the nightlife side. It would be a shame to explore on my own so was hopefully looking for people I could join. I’m ok if it’s just us two or if I can join your group. Leaving some information about me just so I don’t come off as a stranger.
 I’m 23 male from the Philippines currently working in global banking and finance. A personal goal I have over the next few years is to explore asia and I’ll be going to Singapore next year to watch Taylor Swift. Im responsible when I drink and can look after myself as well

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never been in a romantic relationship with anyone in my entire life and I fail to see how this might change in the long run. I personally don&#x27;t think I would be suitable for any kind of romantic relationship and the mere thought of being forced into / being a part of one makes me feel hopeless and sick. Marriage is obviously out of the question. Having kids also seems to me to be an enormous and exhaustive investment and I would not want to force any potential child to live in this increasingly difficult society without having, you know, their consent.
 However, it&#x27;s all too common that people from the older generation here tend to think that my position on marriage is simply insane and my parents are no exception. They did not stress much about the fact that I&#x27;ve never cared to have a partner (they think I&#x27;m the hot shit and millions of people would die to be wedded to me, which is objectively not the case). But now that I almost finish university and still make no move whatsoever, they constantly bring this topic up and push me to go out into the world and look for someone who would marry me and have my kid. It was kinda heartbreaking to see how badly they want to have grandchildren so I fucked up by telling them that I would marry really late, like at my 40s so that they would stop pestering me about that in the near future (and also once I&#x27;m 40s I could tell them that I&#x27;m too old for marriage). They got mildly frustrated and forced me to marry 5 years from now, for many reasons.
 People who choose to stay single, what should I do? Because I told them that I would marry late, they now think that marriage is still on the table and all they need to do is to force me to marry way sooner than I&#x27;d like. What can I say to them so that they would accept the fact that they would not have grandchildren and that their son would not marry, (and that they and I might get side-eye from relatives because of this decision)?
 I would really appreciate your responses!

                              <span>I, from the North, had a chance to visit Saigon for a month. Everyone I knew told me to be careful with my belonging when I&#x27;m there, especially with me having to be extra careful because I&#x27;m careless and always walk around using my phone.
 First day in Saigon, I took a bus, and forgot my wallet with all my cash and all kinds of identification papers on there. I was so scared, I couldn&#x27;t do anything without them, I couldn&#x27;t even go back home if I wanted to without those papers. I remembered the number of the bus, the number on them showed the route they took, but couldn&#x27;t remember the exact plate numbers of the specific one I got on. There were many different busses numbered the same. 
 I thought it was the end for me. Turned out 1 and a half hour later, I found it sitting still, untouched and intact in the same bus seat I was sitting in, despite being a very crowed day with lots of people in and out of busses. During my time in Saigon, I all walked around the streets with my eyes glued to the phone, because habits. So far, nobody has tried to grab it from me. Maybe the rumors that Saigon is full of petty crime thefts is largely exaggerated?
 But hey, this could simply fall in the case of &quot;this-has-never-happened-to-me-so-it-must-not-be-true&quot; fallacy people often use. Maybe because I&#x27;m a dude?

                              <span>My partner and I are planning on visiting Vietnam around March / April next year and am having a bit of difficulty nailing down a trip that doesn&#x27;t seem too packed! We&#x27;re in our early 30&#x27;s and like a bit of a mix of adventure (more myself) and relaxation (beach time).
 We&#x27;re travelling from Australia and there aren&#x27;t any direct flights to Hanoi so we&#x27;ll be flying in and out of HCMC.
 Below is a planned schedule but something (maybe multi destinations) have to go unless we can pull superhuman strength. We&#x27;re locked into 17 nights and can&#x27;t do any longer unfortunately. Would love to hear your recommendations about what you might consider leaving off, and where to possibly spend a bit more time.
 Day 1 – Fly into Saigon. Arrive late so just stay somewhere near the airport.
 Day 2-3 - Fly to Hanoi. Spend 2 nights staying in Old Quarter, visit some sights, food tour etc.
 Day 4 - Spend morning in Hanoi before getting an afternoon bus / limousine to Ha Giang so we can see the views on the way (or should we just get a later bus and spend a few more hours in Hanoi?)
 Day 5-6 - 2 night Ha Giang Loop tour
 Day 7 - Finish Ha Giang Loop and arrive back in Hanoi late
 Day 8 - Do an overnight cruise in La Han Bay
 Day 9-10 - Head to Ninh Binh (Tam Coc) for 2 nights
 Day 11 - Spend day exploring Ninh Binh before getting overnight train to Dong Hoi
 Day 12-13 - Get bus from Dong Hoi to Phong Nha, explore caves and do a single day tour with Oxalis / Jungle Boss
 Day 14 - Get DMZ bus to Hue
 Day 15-17 - Motorcycle ride from Hue to Hoi An via Hai Van Pass, spend 3 nights in Hoi An relaxing / beach time
 Day 18 - Flight from Danang to HCMC before flying out late that night
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I am looking into getting my Vietnamese Passport and am wondering if there is anyone out there similar to me and is familiar with the process.
 I was adopted from Vietnam in 1997, shortly after became a U.S. Citizen with US Passport, etc. My adoptive parents have my original Vietnamese birth certificate and papers, since I was born in Vietnam.
 Is it a tough process to get a Vietnamese Passport? From what I read it seems like as long as I have the correct Vietnamese Paperwork it should just be a submission and waiting period. I would like to have both my US and Vietnamese Passports. Any help is much appreciated!

                              <span>attened an event where we did the national anthem (official one). And I placed my right hand over chest as I was singing it. One dude told me that only Americans do that? Which is weird, since I know it&#x27;s optional to place one&#x27;s hand over chest while doing the anthem, and it means pledging allegiance to the flag but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s exclusive for Americans. Just out of curiosity, just pop the question to see if anybody&#x27;s done the same.

                              <span>Hopefully on the correct subreddit, but my friend and I are about to book flight tickets and the flight back home will be quite early in the morning (8am). I saw people saying it is recommended to arrive 2–3 hours earlier just in case, and we are fine with that however, this means that we would need to be taking the grab from our Airbnb to the airport probably at 4/5am in the morning. 
 My question is, is it safe to take a grab car this early in the morning? We would be in Ho Chi Minh! We just want to have some confirmation that it is indeed safe, as we are both quite young and have never really travelled before. Thank you! :-)

                              <span>Danang has been a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the big city life but I just walked past an empty street, full of vendors with cartfull of nicely presented, but untouched, foods and it made me feel all kinds of ways. I bought a coconut off a lady at a drinks stall just cause she seemed really sad sitting there alone and I felt a little choked up thinking about how much she might have sold tonight in the muggy heat. 
 I get that it’s off season now but it really feels like this town lives off of tourism as I don’t see a lot of locals dining out and I might be projecting but a lot of the businesses seem to be struggling. 
 I just feel very sad seeing all these restaurants with flashy signs sitting empty and potentially even guilty when I make eye contact with the employees inside as I catch glimmers of hope in their eyes that I might come in and dine. 
 I’m recovering from a tummy bug and taking precautions as to not eat at empty places and there are so many coconuts I can buy from a place to support the local businesses. 
 It’s really lovely here though and the people have been so kind. Other than being slightly hotter, it hasn’t even been as rainy as in HCMC so I wish more people would come and visit this lovely place.

                              <span>Hi, had a job interview and everything was ok but when I mentioned I was Muslim i got told That it would be hard because their customers aren’t comfortable with that. I understand stereotypes exist and people in different regions of the world give more credit to them than other parts of the world. Do people in Vietnam in generally have a thing against Muslims ? No judgment, people can think what they like I just want to know because I’ve never come across this in Vietnam before (although I wasn’t that shocked, I wanted to know if there’s any truth to it) .
 Edit: the second question she asked me was about religion after the usual tell me about yourself. Looking back I should have asked if it’s relevant but I didn’t think it would be a problem. Seeing Vietnam’s views on religion I totally understand but she mentioned Muslims and her clients not liking the idea of it.

                              <span>I just got a new SIM card and when I put it in, the top of my phone said 3G and had 4 bars but would still not connect to the internet. I’m not sure if I did something wrong when installing it or if I need to activate something or maybe it’s just not a good connection? Any advice anyone has would be super appreciated!

                              <span>Me (24) and he(24). We have been in a relationship for 2 years now and I moved to live with him. And I realize he has redflag. He always hit himself by banging his head) when I said I want to break up or When I don’t want to talk to him. Most of the time he bit himself I saw it all. And I feel like he is threatening me. Especially, he makes more money than me. I always heard he said that: &quot;I think some people make little money because they were lazy in school, blabla&quot;. Also, he always talks &quot;I want to have a million dollar, so I need to save more money,.. &quot;I feel it&#x27;s good and I know he can gain to it. But I feel very tired when I listen to this thing every day. I also feel we didn&#x27;t match in this relationship. What should I do?. I am afraid of a day when I want to break up with him, he will do something silly

 Yeah, this is a sweep generalization. But we Vietnamese tend to be alot more appreciative of sex and nudity related subjects in foreign art, but when Vietnamese do it, the first reaction from us tend to be throwing stone calling it \&quot;violation of traditional morality\&quot; (vi phạm thuần phong mỹ tục), \&quot;cheap fanservice bait\&quot;,etc...
 An example: “Ghệ iu dấu của e” by tlinh caused controversy among Vietnamese audience, and that song is kiddy compared to Doja Cat’s music, and Doja Cat’s works are widely consumed by Vietnamese with zero controversy.
 This encompasses all kinds of art mediums including music, photography, cinema, literature,etc...As someone who works in art/creative industry. Sex and nudity aren&#x27;t simply &quot;vulgar subjects to satisfy cheap horniness&quot;, sex is a great part of the…</span>

                              <span>BT mình đã khá khó chịu r mà như trường hợp mới gặp sáng nay đúng là lộn hết cả ruột khi gặp 2 bạn nữ mất hơn 10p để thanh toán bằng chuyển khoản, bắt cả hàng chục người đằng sau đứng chờ, trong đấy có mình có nhiều người khác rất vội đổ xăng để đi làm. 2 bạn rõ biết ăn mặc chải chuốt mà sao ý thức kém thế, trả tiền xong còn mất thêm tgian mở yên xe, lấy túi xách bỏ đt vào, bỏ túi xách vào cốp đóng lại nữa mới chịu rời khỏi chỗ đổ xăng, thậm chí người đằng sau nhắc còn hất cằm thách thức nữa.
 Trả tiền mặt chỉ mất tầm 15-30s, trong khi chuyển khoản hay momo để trả tiền xăng nhanh nhất cũng mất 1, 2p để người bán lấy máy, nhập số tiền r sinh mã để các bạn quét, đợi thanh toán xong và trả kết quả về máy. Còn lâu hơn nhiều nếu như 2 bạn trên còn mò tìm nhập mã giảm giá, tìm điểm phát wifi 4G, etc. Thử tưởng tượng giờ cao điểm chỉ cần 2, 3 bạn như thế thì những người đằng sau mất bao nhiêu thời gian? 1 cái tiện nhỏ của các bạn có thể làm mất bao thời gian và tiền bạc của nhiều người khác.

 None of them have ever had jobs and it’s even seen as “pointless” because apparently there’s an amazing office job waiting at the end of the rainbow.
 It really strikes me as odd as a Vina that grew up Canada. Does your average Vietnamese actually have THAT MUCH faith in the school system that it will teach a person everything they need to know?

I&#x27;ll be traveling in Northern Vietnam and I&#x27;m wondering how common cashews and pistachios (including cashew oil) is in the cuisine? And, if it&#x27;s common, any tips on particular dishes to avoid?
 I&#x27;m deathly allergic to cashews and pistachios but I can eat peanuts, almonds, walnuts, and pecans -- though I don&#x27;t always trust folks to make that distinction.

                              <span>Hello! Anyone based in Da Nang that can give me some tips or warnings when looking for apartment? I&#x27;ll be staying in Da Nang for 3 months starting on October and I booked a hotel on my first week while I find a long term apartment rental. 
 My budget is only 2-3mil and I saw that most of rentals in Facebook groups are way out of my budget. What&#x27;s the usual monthly range for a decent apartment for 1 person? 
 I&#x27;m looking for a place in the An Thuong area since that&#x27;s where our co working is at. 
 Any tips/advice for me?

                              <span>One of my favorite places to get coffee was the one right by my granny&#x27;s home, an old lady would sell beverages to the local construction workers there, and her coffee would be around 20000 VND. I had been drinking her Ca Phe Sua Da for years, and I loved it so much I would buy one almost every single day. Unfortunately, she closed the place indefinitely around a month ago, and I have tried many places since.
 The one thing I noticed was I would find the street coffees drastically better than the ones sold in those fancy cafeteria places with ACs and Jazz music playing 24/7. The street Ca Phe Sua Da are sweet, rich, just bitter enough, and their temperature is perfect - not too hot, not too cold. 
 It is extremely hard to match the flavor with the one I had been drinking for all these years though. Some places make it too bitter with little sweetness, some make it taste like a milkshake. The &quot;closest&quot; one which I kind of enjoy comes from, you guest it, the nice middle-aged lady not too far away from my grandma&#x27;s home. 
 Is there a secret to those street coffees? I want to remake it myself, all those years drinking her coffee and now she closed it, it kinda hurt a little bit :&gt;

                              <span>Vietnam non-expert here, thanks in advance for your patience and replies.
 My question is about both politics and economics.
 Vietnam is considered to be more open than China, in terms of investment as well as censorship.
 However, China also had a period where it was considered much more open than it is today.
 Many people describe Vietnam as being very similar to China, only delayed by 20 years or so. On the other side, some people say that there is a qualitative difference between the two countries, due to the different &quot;tone&quot; under which Vietnam was founded - Ho Chi Minh being a world traveler, having Democratic hopes for Vietnam, appreciating Western Democracy, etc. Those people also say that power is a bit less centralized in Vietnam&#x27;s system.
 However, without institutions in place …</span>

                              <span>I’ve been close to this one vietnamese girl ( elder than me around 30’s) . I am really into her and i travelled to HCM just to see her. She works in malaysia and travel back everymonth. We are close sweet and everything but yet she just remains as friends because of her job. But I don’t get the fact that she cares differently and we argue alot when i do small mistakes. She acts like a small baby around me when we are together but texts like so boringly when on the phone. It’s my first time being with a Vietnamese girl so im still actually learning her culture. Anybody could give any advice?

                              <span>I hate these yellow ugly looking death trap buses of Bao Yen especially line 60A. Both drivers and bus boys have no manners. Always late (1 HOUR wait has become a norm this past 2 weeks) and drive the buses like it&#x27;s a motorbike. On top of that, most have broken ACs or doors won&#x27;t close completely. You can&#x27;t track the buses accurately. Unfortunately VinBuses don&#x27;t pass by Ciputra in Hanoi. I&#x27;d pay 20k for a premium bus experience. 
 Fucking Bao Yen.

                              <span>I went to a public pool with my nephew yesterday, it was very crowded. And at the kid&#x27;s pool area, I could notice that it&#x27;s much harder for me to find a kid being in shape than to find a kid who&#x27;s not. Almost every little kids I saw carried a big belly with them. There&#x27;re so many adults who are overweights too.
 I know that one public pool with max of 100 people isn&#x27;t exactly great of a sample size to draw conclusion for millions of Vietnamese. But it does raise some concern, because in my experience, Vietnamese parents don&#x27;t really care much about diets, calories and nutrions. They all thought the fatter the kids, the better, and subsequently trying to feed them as much as possible. And if they aren&#x27;t gaining in size and being underweigh, it&#x27;s not their &quot;growing up times&quot; yet. Fast foods aren&#x27;t really that popular, I think, so we can&#x27;t blame it on them
 I was 173cm, 45kg for most of my childhood, throughout my earlier years, my parents and relatives has kept telling I&#x27;m not at my &quot;time&quot; yet, and kept taking me to doctors and they weirdly said the same, not &quot;my time&quot; yet. Turned out at 22 years old, I was still that skinny. It&#x27;s not until I decided to eat like hell and learn nutrions did I gained 10kg in 2-3 months. They complmented me saying I&#x27;m finally &quot;at my time&quot;, no I just ate like crazy.

                              <span>I was going through the luggage scanner and I got pulled over by the lady for no reason. My luggage just had my clothes and random shampoo and body care stuff for my family. My Vietnamese is pretty good but not good enough to understand what she was trying to pull me over for. I remember my uncle saying something like if they give me a hard time just give them $20. I literally gave her $20 and she’s like no it’s $50. And to shove it discreetly in the drawer for her. I didn’t carry that much cash with me and was planning to withdraw some from the ATM. And I didn’t like how that lady was threatening me so I called my aunt. My aunt told me to ask her for the citation receipt and she said she was trying to help me but we can do it the “hard way” and I have to pay $200 wtf. My aunt wanted to speak to her and she told me to hang up and refused to talk to my aunt and told me I’m a grown adult to take care of it myself. Luckily my aunt knew someone in the airport and he spoke to them and they let me go without paying anything. I wasn’t annoyed they do shady stuff like that, I was annoyed how she spoke to me!
 Edit - I’d also like to point out that scanner lady is a complete moron because she asked for my passport and didn’t flip to the right page with all my info. She pretended to be all official demanding my documentations.

I knew immediately when I wanted treatment that I would never get it from any big or small general hospital. I found one that specialized in mental health and was able to get &quot;what I need&quot;. Which means pills and an affirmation that I have what I suspect I have, nothing more. Still, that was better than other people&#x27;s stories. One person shared that they were publicly mocked by the doctor in the mental health department of Bạch Mai for their suicidal tendency. My God, what the fk!
 Horribly, I told my parents, who were not equipped to handle this, so they reacted &quot;unhelpfully&quot;.

                              <span>As a Vietnamese, I notice this. And it not that long ago, just from our grandfather gerenation, France, US, Japan, China. But in our daily like we don&#x27;t hold grudges or actively say hateful thing toward the nation and it people from the invaders day. Like in our daily life we still talk about them with no hate feeling and very neutral. Except for China, China still actively messing with us and have not give up. Even though, our economy is greatly effect, reply on China we aware of them.
 That my perspective as Vietnamese live our daily life. So what other nation is like, because it seems like China still hate Japan, media about Japan and protry Japan as bad where china kick their ass still very popular til today. From Japan media, it seem like Japan still effects by some contract with the US but from some Japanese movie it seem like also protray Japan have their sin. And worst of all is racist thing in America, black still hate white af and still think they are oppressed today. This remind me how different that is in Vietnam, because we also have minority. If you live in some era where you can still see some local people living among us, they look actually very different than the usual Vietnam people, some also have really dark skin and different hair, if you look in too school system there are also advance thing you can get if you are &quot;Dan toc thieu so&quot; (Wait a minutes, we too have black people). And if you take a look at history, we totally invaded them local, But we are never have racism or hear of them, Now they are one of us. We hate no one, except 36, which is by their own reputation so...

I read that tourists cannot leave the country if they have over 300g of gold without getting permission from the State Bank. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has gone through this experience with gold, or other precious metals like silver?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen several people asking about how to send money from the U.S. or Canada to Vietnam, so I thought I should put together this tutorial.
 And I can&#x27;t believe that not enough folks are taking advantage of the promotion Remitly is running.
  
Pay zero fees on your first transfer. Get $20 off your first transfer when you send $100 or more.
  
The math: Send $100 from the U.S. to a Vietnamese bank account, cash pickup location, or home delivery, and it will only cost you $80. Remitly will cover the other $20. Oh, and there is no fee!
 So here we go...
 Step 1: Click here to sign up for a Remitly account (click the green &quot;Send Now&quot; button).
 Step 2: Enter your email address and password.

 I know this is an odd route, going against the tide of people trying to into U.S. residency. 
 I just have a couple of questions 
 Are there institutions that accept foreign medical students for residency? 
 How much is the tuition? 
 Are residents paid if so around how much? 
 What is the typical length of resid…</span>

 Scary silence. Cheerful Darkness. Sans Chaos ..... HCMC, Vietnam
 Even the most chaotic corner of the city , where I&#x27;m holed up in my my current Chaos Haven, slowly slips into scary silence , as the hour hand moves farther and farther from 12. 
 Standing on the balcony I feel what Edvard Munch may have, before The Scream. Scary Silence . Cheerful Darkness

                              <span>Hi 
 Me and my 10 year old son are planning to travel to Vietnam for Christmas holiday. We plan to fly to Hanoi (4 days) . Then we have 10 more days. We were planning to visit Ha long and stay there on rest of the days but I realised december is chilly. Then I accept to pay for another flight to Ho chi Min city to be closer to the beaches but I read here about Vung Tau, water is brownish and full of garbage. 
 I checked some list of beaches but some beaches can be more suitable for surfers. I want to avoid them. There is never a clear info which beach is suitable for which purpose
 Do you have any idea where can we go for swimming for a week from Hanoi or Ho Chi Min city easily?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I am from central EU and I am looking for a new place to live in for few years.
 Is it hard to get visa in Vietnam, is Vietnam safe to live in, what is the average cost of living in medium populated city?

                              <span>Just after I booked via Booking.com (flexible rate, which I guaranteed with my credit card details) I got a message via Booking and received the following information, among others:
 PAYMENT TERMS: Since reservations via Booking.com are not yet PAID, so the payment must be PAID in Full in ADVANCE before the travel date. Basing on real past customers&#x27; experience and due to the busy and tight schedule and limitation of internet / 3gb connection in Halong bay to guarantee a smoothly trip we require the customer to make the payment completely in advance to avoid these common issues/ problems which will affect seriously your precious time with us such as: Unsuccessful payment due to the internet connection. Being stressful and confused about the payment method after the trip. Problem with customer own credit card (Invalid card, insufficient funds) Since credit card charging is no longer our payment method, we will send you the Invoice via Secured Online Payment Link: Just complete your payment by using VISA/ MASTER and JVC card (2.8 % bank charges)
 And, after asking something:
 “The card info that you provide on booking is just to ensure booking, It doesn&#x27;t charge any amount. Guests will pay via a Government secured link, and we guarantee that you just pay One time for the trip, Never Double charge Do you have whatsapp to contact you better?“
 Is this common practice of handling a payment and I am too sceptical? It sounds a bit suspicious to me and I have booked a few other hotels for this trip but have not received such a payment method / request.
 Appreciate your help!!

                              <span>This comes from my experience taking care of my sister. She tried to commit suicide by overdosing on paracetamol, and she was obviously rushed to the hospital. The hospital was Bach Mai Hospital, which I heard was one of the best hospitals in the country. It made me more shocked when, even in the best hospital, I heard a lot of people and even one of the doctors talk about how suicidal people should not be allowed to receive treatment. &quot;Because they want to die anyway.&quot; they say. It was infuriating because my sister could also hear them. She even commented about it, saying she agreed. She wasn&#x27;t in her right mind, and it makes me so upset that people could say such a thing in front of a patient. I know Vietnam still wasn&#x27;t very knowledgeable about mental health, but it wasn&#x27;t even about that. It&#x27;s about a person&#x27;s life; even if they want to take their own life, you are not to treat them differently. It&#x27;s sickening.

                              <span>Hey!
 I’ve been in Vietnam for about two months now and I’m currently sat having a coffee on the Walking Street. One of the buildings across the road started throwing what looks like money and rice off the roof and everyone started yelling and scrambling to grab the notes. There’s now a crowd (with people running up the street to join) and it looks like they are handing out money.
 I was just wondering if anyone could explain what’s happening?
 Thanks :)
 Edit: this is in HCMC as I realised I didn’t add that before. The building is a guest house but the ground floor is covered in yellow flowers and flags so may be a religious site

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to add that things are rarely black and white, and parents rarely abuse their children for their own pleasures.
 Most parents genuinely love their children and family. And you can see that they themselves are victims of toxic parenting and they themselves suffer from the mental trauma that they don&#x27;t know. We can try to convince them that their way of parenting is wrong but with generations upon generations of trauma and &quot;tradition brainwashing&quot; (so to speak), coupled with the lack of Vietnamese language resources, it&#x27;s really hard for them to realize that the traditional way of parenting is damaging to the mental health of their children.
 So it&#x27;s up to us the younger generations who are equipped with better knowledge to break the cycle, be more understanding to our children at the same time try to fix our own mental trauma so that we don&#x27;t fall into the old ways.

 Kind greetings from Ireland.
 I am an Irish American man in my mid twenties. I am currently considering relocating to Vietnam in early 2024 for a minimum of 1 year. I am considering teaching either or both PE (physical education) and English. Currently I have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Exercise science and I am shortly die to complete my masters in strength and conditioning. I also have TEFL 120hrs certificate. 
 I don&#x27;t have any specific question, I am more just looking for advice and insight to what life could potentially be like for me.

                              <span>Hi guys. 
 I’m a huge history fan, and I have studied Vietnamese history for many years.
 Soon I idol be visiting Vietnam for the second time, and I would love to know where I can go to buy antiques in Vietnam. I’m not interested in replicas. Especially war replicas. I will be in many different cities. I have heard there are certain “if you know where to go” places you can get some nice antiques, so I would love to know where to look.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at traveling to Northern VietNam (Hanoi) in December. For some context, I live in Canada, will be traveling solo, and am looking at going through a couple weeks. 
  
After doing some research, it seems that one of the biggest challenges is getting around VietNam. Alot of posts say the best way to get around is by motorcycle, however I don&#x27;t have a motorcycle license nor do I know how to ride a motorcycle. With motorcycle out of the picture, what is the next best way to get around?
 One thing I&#x27;ve found from traveling to other places is you save $$$ when you book tours through the street vendors and not through the airline/travel agency. Are there street vendors in VietNam that you can walk up to and book a tour right then and there, or is it better to book them beforehand? I&#x27;ve seen a few websites selling travel excursions in VietNam.
 Almost all the excursions to Ha Long Bay I&#x27;ve found include an overnight cruise. Being December (one of the worst months for rough seas) and someone who gets sea sick easily, is it possible to go on a boat for a few hours and head back to Hanoi on the same day? Or is it better to spend the night somewhere around Ha Long Bay?
 What would be a good way to get to Sa Pa? Google says it&#x27;s ~5 hours by car and ~7 hours by train. Similar to Ha Long Bay, is it recommended/possible to stay in Sa Pa overnight?
 Any other recommendations?

                              <span>Me and my Gf are visiting Vietnam in November. I myself really want to do the Ha giang loop but gf is very hesitant. I have a little to none motorcycle experience but she has not (we skate and cycle tho so we&#x27;re pretty agile, also plan on maybe practice a bit on a motorcylce there and see how comfortable we are). Is it do-able or really as bad as they say? My way of thinking is just that if the road gets tricky we&#x27;ll just slow down take our time and watch out, or even do part by foot. If it&#x27;s just not possible to do it on a motorbike, can you do it by car or (part) on foot, is it still worth it then?

                              <span>i only know how to speak VN in the context of interacting with my family members. so with my aunts/uncles, i say “cháu” for myself, with parents/grandparents i say “con”, with my older cousins i say my name or “em.” i didn’t grow up in an area with lots of vn restaurants or shops so i never learned how to properly communicate with a stranger who isn’t related to me. anwyay i went to paris this weekend and found a vietnamese pho restaurant, i don’t speak french, the shopowners were happy to be able to speak vn but the problem is i just didn’t know how to talk about myself or them and thus construct basic sentences even though it’s my first language… so they’d ask like “khu gần đây đẹp quá?” i wanted to say “[i] think so too” or “what do [you] do for a living” but i wasn’t sure what word was appropriate if you aren’t sure how are you supposed to address someone and call yourself?

                              <span>Apparently Uber drivers can’t see where the rider’s going until they accept the ride and I wonder if this is the case for Grab too? 
 I’m asking as I want to travel from Da nang to Hoi an and I worry it might leave the driver “stranded” if he doesn’t find a customer on his way back. It’ll cost roughly 350k dong for the 40min-1hr trip (one way) and it’d make me feel somewhat better if I knew the driver has a choice in his choosing of rides

                              <span>As title says my daughter is starting a trip in SEA in HCMC and is arriving at midnight. I&#x27;ve travelled extensively through SEA but that was over 20 years ago and I am a male. Should she be concerned of being overwhelmed trying to figure out how to find her Grab ride and everything coming at her before getting her bearings ? What can I get her to do to make it easier and safer if anything?
 Thanks, from concerned Dad.

                              <span>And by that I mean the dish you can order everyday (from almost any restaurant) and it will be fresh and full of flavor?
 So far the dishes that seem to do this for me are
  
Bun cha
 Banh Mi
 Sometimes Pho or Bun Bo Hue
  
I know I&#x27;m missing out on some classic dishes that are always delicous. Please help! I live in Saigon btw. 
 I also like beef salad. But when I get chicken salad the chicken is so hard to chew it&#x27;s not working for me.

                              <span>I’m looking to sell a Diamond ring. My mom suggested I sell it when I go back to Vietnam vs selling while I’m in the the US. She says I’ll get more money that way. I’m a little nervous about getting ripped off because its very obvious I’m a foreigner. Would I even get more money? Also if I wanted to buy a jewelry while I’m there, how often do you get sold fakes? I know nothing about jewelry and I feel like I could easily get dupped. Maybe I’m just too suspicious but she seems to think I’d get more of my moneys worth in Vietnam.

                              <span>I am hoping to travel to Vietnam mid to late February. I know tet is on the 10th so I’m wondering what traveling will be like in the week or so after that? I have read that Tet occurs for 9 days but have also seen that it could be longer so am hoping to get some insight on it. Will tours and resturaunts still be operating or will things still be pretty shut down? Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi. I am travelling to Vietnam for 1 month in october. I have had all the vaccines my government says are essential, but there are some that are up to yourself to determine if you need them. These are the vaccines for rabies, japanese encephalitus and malaria. I tried asking in travel forums, but they say &quot;ask your doctor&quot;, which I obviously already have, but it is up to me to determine these three on my own.
 What do you think is necessary? I am travelling throughout the country, National Parks, trekking in the northern region, but mostly tourist places.

                              <span>Once a guy tried to sell me some boxing classes. I said i have a certain weight goal in mind. He said its impossible because i have kids, which i dont, he just assumes that base on my age.
 Today i went to a spa for a free facial treatment, the girl of course tried to sell me the package. By the end she said after the treatment you gonna look so beautiful im gonna introduce someone to you. Like i cant get a guy by myself or i need to change anything about myself to get a guy. I talked to another girl earlier i said im not sure i want to have kids, she said im so short sided.
 They are sales people, they need to focus on the product, not people personal life. There are zillion reasons why someone is where they are. If you dont know dont just make assumptions. I know the culture is nosy but assumption is not the answer.

                              <span>Most men I&#x27;ve met and talked to disapproved of them, saying that they&#x27;re way too effeminate. 
 Do most Vietnamese men hold the same opinion? I mean, Vietnam, or any Asian country for that matter, is heavily affected by Korea entertainment industry. Korea, in itself, is a kingdom and trend-setter in terms of entertainment and beauty, it&#x27;s no doubt we are somewhat influenced by them. Most of our hairstyles, or fashion styles, right now follows what&#x27;s trendy in Korea, which would affect what Vietnamese choose to wear and what clothes are produced and promoted for men fashion. 
 I&#x27;ve heard Vietnamese men complaining complaining endlessly on Facebook too, wondering why women likes such girly boys. But I think if they don&#x27;t have any appeal at all to women, they won&#x27;t be that successful and loved. Maybe what men thinks women find attractive is drastically different than what women actually find attractive.
 For me, as a gay men and somewhat masculine, I find half of them very pleasing to the eyes, very &quot;pretty&quot;, the other half too effeminate for my taste. They are &quot;beautiful&quot;, but not &quot;hot.&quot; But it depends on which idol though, some has a perfect blend of masculinity and feminity, of handsomeness and gracefulness that makes them hotter than any 6-packs Western bros.
 Do Vietnamese men like the image of male K-pop idols?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never understood people&#x27;s obsession with having a son, a male heir. My father, for example, abandoned his previous wives because they couldn&#x27;t bring him a son. It was not until my mother, and not until having 5 daughters prior to having me, did he have a son.
 But sadly, that son, which is me, is gay. Don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s ironic? The way my father was obsessed with having a son, and he turned out to be gay? I guess it&#x27;s his karma. Never mind, he abandoned my mother too and he has never existed to me in my mind.
 It&#x27;s just that a family in my neighborhood, who are really poor, they have three young daughters already and they&#x27;re still pushing for another one in hope it&#x27;s a boy. Watching the mother with a big belly and three daughters already barely having enough to eat and study pains my heart. 
 Why the obsession with having to have a boy? Um, he could be gay, you know? He could be a transgender. He could die young? He could be a drug addict and a failure, in which case you must have 3 or 4 sons in case then?

                              <span>In the midst of crazy public holiday traffic last night I jumped out of a Grab when I could not knowing my phone slipped from me while doing so, and by the time I realised and ran back he was gone. As a solo traveller it was daunting to think what I should do and what I couldn&#x27;t do without my phone. Trying not to panic, I went to the nearby security guard of a mall. He understood the gist of what I said and took me to the mall information desk. Now, I assumed in the crowded noisy and busy place they would just wave me away and say go to the police station or something. But they jumped into action, got my details and number (thank f*** I had my Vietnam phone number written down seperately on hand), took my photo and messaged security to go over CCTV to try to get the car plate number, let me use their phone to see if I could get any Grab details from my email, and kept calling my phone when they could. 
 The CCTV couldn&#x27;t get a plate number. I feared the driver wouldn&#x27;t hear my phone or would just keep it, but eventually the driver answers. He had finished for the day but would drive back, although it would take time with all the traffic. I expected he would want a compensation for time and fuel and honesty, but when he eventually arrived he refused the cash in my hand. I made him accept a bag of those holiday moon cake things the mall was selling as a thank you, and I also went back and bought a couple for the information desk ladies afterwards. 
 This is a simple faith in humanity restored post because I feared the worst and was touched by how much they cared, especially at such a busy working time for them, for some tourist. Caring for others makes a difference.

                              <span>We are in Da Nang for a few months and just outside the city there’s a good beach spot along the highway just past the Lady Buddha. There is a man there who charges you to park your scooter on the shoulder of the highway. Is this normal? Seems strange we are paying a random guy (no uniform or signage anywhere) to park on the side of a public road. Appreciate any help!

                              <span>Even in the US, comedy shows of Ali Wong often recognize the superiority of Chinese and denigrate the Vietnamese as &#x27;jungle people&#x27;. I hear this term a lot. Even from Chinese kids who grew up or were born in the US. In fact, I actually hear a lot more disgusting racial slurs directed at Vietnamese by Chinese than just &#x27;jungle people&#x27;.
 Chinese ain&#x27;t that tall and their scrawny looking military appears extremely funny versus the US. So why the hate? Explain.

                              <span>I just ordered on the website since there was a sale going on for the product i wanted.
 It seems to have a bad reputation since i have seen a lot of people online saying that they lost their product or that the carrier says it is just updating tracking and there being fake or poor quality products on the website, most of them i see from mostly old comments and posts from 3-5 years ago, usually with not much proof than just words, can anyone reassure me on this?

                              <span>Im sure this is often posted on here but during my travels of Vietnam with my partner next February we are debating doing a Ha Long Bay cruise?
 They seem expensive so trying to figure out if it’s worth it. Lots of research I’ve done so far highlights the trash and the fact it’s a massive tourist trap.
 What do people think? We are English, I’ve travelled a lot and her not so much. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I will be arriving in your beautiful country tomorrow as the last stop on a business trip. I will fly out again Thursday morning. Unfortunately I&#x27;ll be working most days, and probably taken out to dinner in the evening. Is there anything I can/should buy and have shipped to the hotel, that would be guaranteed to arrive by Wednesday to make sure I get it before leaving? Anything from candies, to souvenirs, gifts for my wife, etc. Ideally links would be great too! I&#x27;ll be in Saigon if that makes any difference. 
 Thanks so much in advance!
