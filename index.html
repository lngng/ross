                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m planning to travel to Vietnam during december 2023 - january 2024 for a three weeks period.
 During my travel, I want to explore the Mekong Delta region and cities such as Can Tho, Chau Doc, Long Xuyen, Ca Mau and Ha Tien during a three weeks period.
 I wonder if it&#x27;s doable on a 50cc scooter (like a honda chaly or a similar scooter) or if it&#x27;s preferable to do it on a bike. (I do a lot of bike and bikepacking in France so I&#x27;m pretty ok with that).
 I didn&#x27;t have any driver licence so I can&#x27;t rent a powerful motorbike, and I don&#x27;t want to have any issues with the local police
 I&#x27;m also planning to stay in &quot;homestay&quot; like; guesthouses; etc
 So I had a few questions:
 -Can I find a long-term (3 weeks) for a 50cc scooter in Ho Chi Minh City or maybe buy one ? I wonder what&#x27;s the best solution.
 -Did the road/dirt road are practicable on a 50cc scooter or a bike ?
 -Did you have any advice about the project ?
 I already look on internet, but I can&#x27;t find so much infos on the Mekong Delta and backpacking it.
 Thanks all for your answers !
 Cheers

                              <span>I will be traveling to Vietnam and I&#x27;m prescribed Xanax (classified as a psychotropic in Vietnam). Did some research and realized it&#x27;s a controlled substance there (but not illegal?). Is it safe to bring my Xanax into the country as long as it&#x27;s in the original pharmacy container and I have a letter from my doctor? / do they even care about checking medications?
 The trip could be a disaster if it is confiscated from me! haha

                              <span>Hi. My sisters and I are going to Vietnam for the first time since we left 30 years ago. We were too little to remember our birthplace. I’m excited and nervous since our Vietnamese is at best to get our orders right at restaurants. I could use any helps or suggestions. So far, we have looked into inclusive tour package that will take us from HCM to Hanoi and all the cities in between. What are the best gifts to bring to Vietnam from America? What to avoid or to watch out for in Vietnam? I appreciate as many suggestions as possible. BTW, also my first time flying outside of America. Thank you.

                              <span>Hey all, 
 I’m traveling to Vietnam in late November for about 11 days total. I’ll be spending 5 days in Hanoi and 6 days in HCMC. I’ve been to both cities previously, as well as Da Nang &amp; Hue. So I’ve basically seen most of the touristy stuff there (including Ha Long Bay) and have decided to skip central VietNam entirely this time around.
 I’m thinking of making a side trip to Sapa while up north and potentially Da Lat or the Mekong delta while in HCMC. 
 Is two days in Sapa enough time to see most things there or should I add an extra day? Is Da Lat worth checking out for two days or so? How about the Mekong delta? I know both cities are pretty touristy and I can live with that. I just want to check out new places and get out of the hustle of the big cities. 
 Since I’ve done Hanoi and HCMC, I just plan on chilling, eating while there so my days spent in the smaller cities is flexible. 
 Also, I know the weather is hot/humid year round, but should I expect rain during this time of year?
 Thanks for any suggestions or recommendations!

 We will be taking a train from Hanoi to Ninh Binh, we booked a sleeper cabin with 6 people. The seats we booked turned out to top berths. So, question - during the day time, how does it work with seating? Can we use the lower berth to sit?

                              <span>I am a Thai has learned Vietnamese for not long but I’m learning a lot of Vietnamese vocabulary quickly.
 It takes an average of 1100 hours for an English speaker to become fluent in Vietnamese but how many hours does it require a Thai user.
 The average Thai speaker knows cursory English, meaning that they know how the Latin alphabet works.
 I posted this here because I couldn’t post on r/learnvietnamese.

                              <span>I’m adopted and recently reconnected with my birth family. My boyfriend and I are staying with my birth mother right now. we had plans to leave at the end of this week. 
 A couple of days ago we were put on the spot and invited to a wedding, of who I now know is my birth mothers half sisters daughter(I found out the relation a couple days ago). We were planning on leaving before but they really wanted us to come so we said we could stay till the wedding. The bride wants us to be part of the wedding party (bridesmaid/groomsmen). I had only met her once before this. It’s very kind of them to invite us. I’ve read other things on Reddit about wedding gift giving and if you’re family or friends.
 We weren’t expecting this event at all. 
 What should we expect and how much money should we give as a gift?

                              <span>Hi there, Planning a trip from Thailand to Vietnam, Da Nang. As an avid diver, I would like to hear your experiences. What is the water temperature around this time of the year, how murky is the water really, and is it generally enjoyable? I am worried after the perfect conditions that Thai waters offer it won’t be as pleasant there.

                              <span>I studied abroad in America for four years. I completed my bachelor&#x27;s degree in Marketing and Data Analytics in 2021, and I got a job in the US in 2022. I was on STEM OPT, and my employer was willing to sponsor my H1-B visa. 
 Things were looking up for a bit, and I thought I could settle in America. However, my health worsened in September 2022, and I was constantly sick every month. I got a serious case of vertigo that made me spend a day in the ER in August. And then, a month later I got diagnosed with H Pylori, a nasty stomach virus that could cause severe heartburn. In December 2022, I got Covid after attending happy hour with my coworkers. I had to deal with all of these along with anxiety and depression. In March 2023, I decided to quit my job and move back to Vietnam because I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I didn&#x27;t even apply for the STEM extension or participate in the H1-B lottery. 
 I moved to Saigon after coming back to Vietnam (I&#x27;m from Hanoi), but I still feel like a loser for coming back to Vietnam. When I set out to study in America, my goal was to get a job and a green card and then I would choose where to live. However, things didn&#x27;t go as planned, and I am completely lost. I am scared of getting back into the corporate world because of what happened to me. I&#x27;m scared that my health will be in jeopardy again. I&#x27;m still looking and applying for jobs right now, but deep down I wish no one would hire me so that I could rest for a bit more. 
 Now I&#x27;m completely lost because the goal that I had been working towards for 5+ years was squashed, and now I have no goals or directions. If anyone could just slap me out of this confusing stage of life, please do.

                              <span>Hey guys! Just wondering if I did something wrong 4 weeks ago. I&#x27;m still pondering about it till this day. We moved in a hotel in the tourist area for a month and almost every night at this outside Huda bar there was a white puppy sitting on a folding chair. He had a leash and tip jar next to him and I would always go up and pet him (I asked if I could pet him every time). And I fell in love with the little guy. So one day I went to the pet store near by and bought some puppy sized toys to give to him. When I saw the puppy again a few days later I patted him and gave him a rope toy to play with and we tugged it and all that cute stuff. I left him with the toy and saw the puppy about a week later without it. I never saw him since then. Is it bad here to gift a dog a toy? I had no bad intent or anything I just wanted to treat him. :(

 Do you know about &#x27;pod chill&#x27; in Vietnam? I thought it was a regular vape given to me by someone, and after inhaling it 8-9 times, I collapsed. What is this? Is it synthetic weed? 
 I&#x27;m really worried 
 Are there people around who do this a lot(8-9times)? 
 I&#x27;m very concerned about possible brain damage.

                              <span>I’m living and working for a cave adventure company in Phong Nha, Quang Binh. It used to be a very popular place for adventurer lovers before the covid. But things have changed a lot after that. Feel like it’s not as hot as it was. Have you been in Phong Nha? Any thoughts about how to have more people know about this beautiful place?

                              <span>I live in VN as foreigner. I know that vietnamese love karaoke and it&#x27;s fine. Until they crank up the volume to absolutely outrageous level.
 I live in a very good place and very nice city, but unfortunately to me there are few villas nearby where drunk viet people like to sing karaoke almost every day up until midnight. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I understand they want to have fun. I understand they are drunk and don&#x27;t care about other people.
 What I don&#x27;t understand is why no one is doing anything about it? 20 drunk people affect thousands citizens who live nearby. Everyone is happy about noise? Can&#x27;t believe it.
 Now the main part: there are four 5* star hotels near these villas. Classy, expensive, with good cars around it, etc et etc. Why management is doing nothing about drunkards in villas? It is so easy to call police. It is so easy to give them some money so they patrol this area a little more often. Submit complains, escalate problems to police superiors, even bribe if needed, etc etc. But why nothing? I live here for 6 months and problem doesn&#x27;t go away. 
 I have so many questions.
 Hotel customers don&#x27;t complain even when karaoke blasts at midnight? Hotel management doesnt care about anyone? Police doesnt care about 5* star hotels?
 Maybe vietnamese customers dont care about noise even if they rich because they are used to karaoke from their childhood. But what about foreign customers who live in 5* hotels? They don&#x27;t complain too? I can hardly believe foreigners love this noise while they pay big sums of money for fancy hotel.
 Can some explain me this mystery?

                              <span>Hi everyone. My husband and I are spending 1 week in Vietnam in November. Our airfare and hotel are booked. Wondering how much we should bring for food/ activities? Would $500 USD suffice for the both of us, for 1 week? Staying in Hanoi, da nang and hoi an. 
 Thank you!

I have zero reasons to visit let alone meet people I have never heard off and never talked. They are talking like they are forcing me too and it will not happen. 
 I do not know what ulterior motives they have for doing this and I do not want to be dragged around everywhere meeting relatives that I didn&#x27;t even know existed. It looks like a beautiful place and all these family members sound really nice. 
 Food does sound good though.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Sooo, I am a 26yo art student, viet born in western europe and would love to explore some contemporary art spaces and the creative wave that’s been happening and just learn about the people and the culture.
 The thing is that I visited last summer, the first time in 15 years and was with family most of the time. This was a beautiful experience but also, I was super annoyed with how paranoid my family was about me doing stuff alone. I always needed someone of my family to be there with me or someone they knew to escort me around for the most simple things like getting a juice around the corner. 
 The main thing they’re scared off is me being sold, kidnapped or deceived and drugged, because I’m recognizable as a Viet Kieu and am female. Sometimes I get mistaken for being fully foreigner, like Thai or Indonesian, cause I don’t look like the typical Viet when it comes to my style or my accent, or whatever reason they say I don’t look like a typical viet. (fam also say I’m too ‘hiện’ lol)
 The thing is, I just want to explore places, meet likeminded creatives and enjoy my culture outside of the family. But is it true that I’m not safe doing things on my own? Can I really not take Grab’s without the chance of being kidnapped? Can I really trust no one?
 My family be saying crazy stuff like ‘dont go on dates cause if you reject him, he’ll drug you’ or ‘white people have it easier in VN than Viet Kieu’ 🤡
 Anyway, thoughts? I just wanna explore new spaces and hang out with new people but how my family puts it; I’m in danger as a female not viet-born person doing things on my own.

                              <span>Hi all! I will be visiting your country in January 2024. I&#x27;m currently booking places to stay and I can&#x27;t seem to figure out any good places to visit between Hanoi and Hue. I&#x27;ve come across Dong Hoi, is this city worth visiting? Are there other cities/towns between the two aforementioned cities? Should I just take on overnight train or bus to Hue instead? 
 Thanks so much for your advice:)

                              <span>Looking for a food tour basically, want to experience some different food and drink. I have seen a few bigger companies that host this idea but is there another option?

                              <span>I have a little over 3 days left in Vietnam. I’m in Da Nang at the moment and am considering going up to Ba Na Hills. I plan to spend the other days exploring Hoi An, so trying to figure out what’s the best way to spend the other day. 
 Is it worth it?
 Generally I’m not a fan of those tourist trap kind of places, but the views from up there look incredible. It is also pretty damn expensive though.

                              <span>Let us know why in the comments. This is not a race based question, so please note this carefully when answering. We are talking about behaviours in Vietnam, for example: bad manners, noise, arrogance, rudeness, lack of respect, crime, cheapness, drugs abuse, physical fights, etc.... The poll only allows 6 choices so I added the ones frequently mentioned in this group lately. If you feel I have missed an important one place it in the comments. This is only meant as a point of discussion and not to antagonize any specific group of people. Please by civil in the discussion.

                              <span>I know the VCP is less authoritarian than the CCP and more socially progressive. However, I&#x27;m not too sure on the other metrics. Is it overall more effective at managing the country, the economy, and infrastructure? Does it receive more support from the Vietnamese population than the CCP does from the Chinese population. Is the VCP more corrupt than the CCP or less?

                              <span>Hey, so i began a master degree in international business and they offer me to learn a asian language for 1 year and go there for 6 month to have vietnamese course. I choose vietnam because japan, china and korea don&#x27;t interested me. And i think southest asia is my favorite part of asia (even if i only did 2-3 countries in asia). But now i realize it&#x27;s kind of a big choice i&#x27;ve made and begin to question that choice as i don&#x27;t know if i really want to work there and if it&#x27;s worthy. Is there any foreigner learning Vietnamese with no origin ? And how do you think vietnam will evolve in the futur ?

I own a small tech firm in Korea and since its a bit of a trend in Korea to outsource parts of development to Vietnam, I thought I&#x27;d spend my time in between touring and meeting future family and gorging myself with food to test the waters myself and arranged some meetings with some businesses here. 
 Not all the meetings I&#x27;ve had were with Korean people running shop here in Vietnam, but the meetings I&#x27;ve had with Koreans here have not been good to say the least.

 i understand that there are always good and bad people, especially in dating apps. but, if you&#x27;re here for a beautiful girl that is willing to go with you to an alcoholic place on first date within 5 seconds of talking on the app, you deserve it.
 please, for the safety of yourself, try to find the red flags. sometimes they&#x27;re very obvious, unless you&#x27;re thinking with your reproductive organ.

                              <span>I have 2 family members ( cousins ) that I loan money to a few years ago. 1k usd each, first cousin was for her start up business and the other was another 1k usd to take her mom to the doctor/big hospital in SG... Which she never took her, &quot; she got better &quot;. I haven&#x27;t talked to the 1st cousin with the start up business over a year, but I do have her FB. The second cousin agreed she would pay me back this Tet when I visit VN. She usually call and ask how I&#x27;m doing and such but after the loan and I found out she didnt take her mom to the hospital , she kinda went MIA. I do have proof and receipt when I transfer the money. 
 Would it be rude of me if I just call them up out of nowhere to remind them that still owe me money? or should I just wait until I see them when I land and ask for it? 
 anybody has experiences of getting your money back from family members, let me know lol.

 The problem I have is that I found out she is quite close with a colleague there and I think it may be more than just close... I have tried to translate the texts that I have but I just don&#x27;t understand Vietnamese (especially with abbreviations and slang!) on top of that, I don&#x27;t know how male-female friendships are supposed to be in Viet Nam, can anyone help me?

                              <span>Hello everyone! My husband and I are visiting Vietnam this upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. We are planning a trip with my parents who live in Vietnam for 5 days during the 2 weeks before the holiday. My parents want to go from Quang Binh to Hoi An in 5 days. They want to visit Phong Nha Cave, Paradise Cave, Hoi An, Da Nang, and Hue. The plan is that we will land in Da Nang and travel with them immediately.
  
We will not use a tour agency so I am a little afraid of how many destinations they want to go to within such a small timeframe. Definitely, we will use public transportation to commute and that takes a lot of time to commute already. 
 The current itinerary: Quang Binh (1 day), Hue (1 day), Da Nang (1-2 day), and Hoi An (1 day)
 I hate jet lag and I want to take it slow to adjust to the local time when I first land. 
 We would like to enjoy the trip rather than move through each location super fast. We are considering tailoring in Hoi An for our wedding and it seems to not be doable with this iterary.
 I heard Hoi An is super crowded and 2 out of 5 days we plan to travel are weekends. 
 We love our parents but at the same time, we really want to visit Da Nang-Hoi An without rushing it.
  
Do you think this is a good idea? How can we commute between places if this trip is doable?
 I am gearing towards traveling to Ha Noi (3 days) and Halong Bay (cruise-2 days) so that we can experience the Northern vibe of the Tet holiday and enjoy more time on the trip.

Some pieces were really light in colour and some really dark.

                              <span>Hi yall, I&#x27;m a Mormon currently residing in Hanoi. I have always been rather ecumenical, and find beauty in all faith traditions, Christian or otherwise. Attending services of other religions is something I greatly enjoy, and it helped greatly with my spiritual growth. Any recommendations for interesting churches worth a visit? I prefer Christian services, but recommendations for places of worship of other faiths are also welcome. Thank you.

                              <span>Có ai ở đây gặp tình trạng như mình chưa ? Mình dùng redmi note 11 pro plus 5g. Máy mình bị lỗi âm lượng, ấn giảm 1 nấc thì tăng hết cỡ, nó có ghi lại báo cáo lỗi, đây là lần 2. Lần đầu thì nó báo lỗi xong mình khởi động lại máy, dùng như bình thường. Lần này thì nó lại đưa về main menu. Mình tìm hiểu mới biết nó là xóa dữ liệu đưa máy về trạng thái mới tinh. Mình mới tá hỏa ra nhưng k còn cách nào khác nữa. Mình có khởi động lại 4 lần thành công nhưng máy về trạng thái mới tinh, và có thêm logo &quot;safe mode &quot;. Mình làm theo các bước khởi động như trên mạng nhưng đều như vậy. Đến lần 5 thì thành công đưa máy về trạng thái mới hoàn toàn, k còn logo. Nhưng khi mình nhập gmail thì có tên gợi ý tài khoản gmail trên bàn phím, mặc dù mình chưa từng gõ tên tài khoản đó sau khi khởi động. Mình muốn hỏi là có cách nào để khôi phục lại hết các dữ liệu trong máy không ? Ảnh, video, tài liệu, tài khoản ?

                              <span>Hey I am male and I am looking for a good massage place with male masseurs in Ho Chi Minh.
 Preferably I am looking for full body massages or body scrubs. I’ve been to Vietnam already and been to the Miu Miu spa and liked the massage there but it was a female masseur and I didn’t feel so comfortable with that. I’ve also been to the Tarzan spa but that was more like a hidden brothel and the „massage“ was really bad. Definitely not looking for a happy ending thing. Looking for a proper massage!
 Price range should be around 500k. Would appreciate any serious tips maybe someone knows a good place.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Helloo I am doing research on the avocado sector in Vietnam. Does anybody have some reliable sources about the history of the avocado industry in Vietnam or information about the (current) avocado production chain or any information at all about the avocado cultivation, the marketing behind it, human/workers rights, sustainable cultivation etc.
 Anything is welcome and helpful!
 I do this for a report for my minor in International Development Management, I do know how to search for sources, but I have done this for other projects as well and Reddit always surprises me with very helpful sources and information🤗
 I you are someone or know someone who works with or in the Vietnamese avocado chain who is willing to partake in an interview also please let me know! 
 Thanks in advance!

(Highly likely won’t have it but not afraid to ask) I’m on my 3 rd month in VN and miss American holiday like this since it’s been a rough year and like to celebrate those close to me.

Only 30 minutes after we had left we see new photos on their Google Maps, the photos she took of us and also screenshots from a security camera! 
 Why do people do this? And is this a common thing?

                              <span>The title says pretty much everything. I am a foreigner that opened a company in Vietnam. I hired an external company to help me out with accountancy/payroll. But they are an absolute disaster. The first accountant they assigned was a delinquent that made illegal movements in my bank account. And in the past 6 months I have had 6 different accountants assigned to me. All of them are late in filing the paperwork, I have to constantly chase them, and they hardly reply to emails.
 So does anyone know where to find a good accountant that can help with accountancy and payroll? If not in this forum, somewhere else? I am relatively new in Vietnam and I am not sure where else to look. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I’m looking for secluded, beautiful beaches with preferably little to no trash. I’ve been before, but it’s been years and I didn’t explore the whole island. 
 If such beaches don’t exist on PQ anymore, how’s Côn Đảo? TIA

                              <span>are there a lot of teochew people in vietnam? my family is second generation in vietnam. with both of my grandparents being born in vietnam and my mom born in vietnam as well. my family is pretty vietnamese but our roots are teochew people of china. i was born in america but pretty much identify as being vietnamese american. it’s kind of hard to identify that i’m chinese bc i don’t really know much about chinese culture other than some things about being teochew. anyone else relate to this struggle? like i feel fake by saying i’m vietnamese bc i’m technically chinese. yet my second language is vietnamese where i am fluent. and when i say i’m chinese i feel like most people immediately think mandarin or canto which i cannot relate to at all. makes me sad to see my teochew lineage slipping away. my dad is also teochew but cambodian born. my grandma on my dad side speaks teochew but i’m not as close to her and she also identifies a lot with khmer culture.

                              <span>I went to Vietnam in June for a few weeks with my wife and daughter. We went to Ho Chi Minh City, Que Nhon, and Dalat. We decided to buy insurance from Berkshire Hathaway Travel protection. We chose the coverage that only covered medical emergencies. The price was less than 100$. Mid way through our trip my daughter became very sick fever ect. She had a bacteria infection which landed her in the hospital for anti-biotics when over the counter did not do the trick. We stayed at Vinmec got receipts for everything and ended up staying in the hospital for 7 days. The cost for everything came out to around 3,000. Vinmec gave us all receipts in English and Vietnamese. I opened a case with Berkshire while on Vietnam and they said I had a year to send all docs. When we got home I sent all receipts and charges from my credit card they also asked for bank statements and after 25 days I received a check for the full amount. They covered the hospital stay, medicine, emergency room visit too. It was my first experience with Berkshire but will use them in the future. I recommended this to my friend that also went recently and she also has to take her daughter to the hospital it wasn&#x27;t expensive but it sounds like it was covered her bill was only 300$

 I still find most of Indian tourists to be lovely and polite when it comes to walking around the city or passing through people taking pictures.
 Majority of the east Asian guys have this condescending attitude like they own the place.
 Japanese excluding.
 Love from a southeast asian guy.
 Would love to be in tours with more Indian Families and Solo back packers.

The past few weeks, I&#x27;ve had &quot;people&quot; add me saying that they knew me and claiming we have met before. I googled the picture of the first person from Việt Nam and the search came up with a Korean celebrity. The second person added me and sent me a message and I blocked them immediately. Is this something common on Zalo? My partner thinks the app has been compromised and that our info might be compromised as well. I was wondering if it was something common and that we are just beginning to experience it later than sooner. Should we just continue on blocking them? Has this happened to any of you using Zalo?

The country is, honestly speaking, nothing sort of magical yet incredibly flawed. Really love it from a visitor’s perspective thou. These are some of the photos I took using a film camera between 2018 and 2019.

                              <span>I’m a tourist who’s going to visit Hanoi in a week or so. Looking for various options for the Ha long bay day cruise. First of all, should I take a 1N2D cruise or a day cruise. Second of all, which cruise should I take and where should I look for it ?, and most importantly what’s the difference between route 1 and route 2 ?

                              <span>Hello I am looking for friends to help me practice Vietnamese. I know a little but not much. I have been learning on Duolingo for maybe a year. But my skill is still not good. I would like to message some Vietnamese. I visited Ho Chi Minh City last year and I didn’t know much. It would be cool to learn more. My girlfriend is from Vietnam and I want to surprise her with my progress.

                              <span>Sorry for long post as it may help bring awareness. I want to share a dating experience I had in HCMC with a scammer on badoo that I met in person who’s trying to blackmail.
 I got a message from a badoo account “BlueSky” from a “girl” who claimed that they are single mom looking for relationship and works as sales manager at a BMW showroom. When I asked her Zalo, she said she will share only after meeting. I said let’s meet in person for coffee next day, I noticed she kept asking to send the meeting address almost every hour but I said I’ll send next day before the meeting time.
 Eventually I texted her the cafe address and was waiting. She said she’s lost and trying to find the cafe, I video called her several times but she declined. So I felt maybe it’s a prank and left the cafe.

                              <span>Hi! I (27F) am going to Vietnam from Dec 13th - Jan 2nd with two friends (27F, 26M). We are super excited :) 
 After exploring the country for a while, we would like to enjoy the beach and the sun before returning to -15°C and snow in Norway. After the beach we will go to HCM for NYE. 
 We have looked at Phu Quoc, but I am reading a lot about construction and trash here on Reddit. We don&#x27;t have the budget to stay at a super fancy resort, but could pay to stay at the beach during the day. It seems like the island fits our preference in terms of weather, but I would love your opinion on the island in December in general. 
 Con Dao also seems interesting, if anyone has some input. 
 We are looking for: beach, sun, chilling (but also some activites). 
 I appreciate your help :)

 ​
 my girlfriend is vietnamese, she likes reading a lot but here in France she doesn&#x27;t have access to a lot of books in vietnamese, so I was thinking to get her an ebook reader so she could download the books she wants directly to the ebook. Do you know where to get them?
 If you do, can you give me some links? And if you have recommendations of nice books to have that have been translated to vietnamese, or vietnamese books as well of course.
 ​
 Thanks : D

                              <span>Got this from a street vendor on motorbikes and he demanded 200k. Im pretty sure that&#x27;s not how much locals pay so I&#x27;m curious what&#x27;s the fair price for these. In D1 if it makes any difference

                              <span>Good evening, 
 I’m heading to HCMC for five days next week. When I was there last year, I was turned away from several money changers in the D1 area, namely a couple in Saigon Centre when I approached them with USD100 bills. They were more than happy to take my Singapore dollars though. Can’t quite remember what their explanations were (because I was getting quite frustrated and worked up then) so I thought I would check in here before I bring along USD on me again on this trip. Can I use Revolut/Youtrip in HCMC? 
 Thanks y’all!

                              <span>Hello everyone! I am a tourist visiting Vietnam and I have a question. My partner and I are currently in Nha Trang and I was about to buy some fruits from a market. I chose 2 apples and a kaki fruit, the owner said it cost 190k, which I think is a lot (same fruits would cost me only about 50k in my home country), so I offered 50k instead, which they refused after a bit of back and forth. My partner said to go, it&#x27;s a scam but I feel bad/unsure. I know as tourists we usually get offered higher prices but I&#x27;m wondering if there is maybe something &quot;special&quot; about these fruits that make them expensive. What do you pay for these or would pay maximum for fruits like apples? Was this a scam or..? Thank you very much :)

                              <span>Hi Vietnamese friends, there is a girl I am interested in, and she gave me a cold last week. 
 This week I met her again, I joked about how she gave me a cold, and she showed me TikTok video about anh bị cảm rồi, where the people proceeded to dance. 
 I am trying to learn Vietnamese to understand her and her culture, but I have checked the translation and still do not understand the meaning behind the joke. 
 I just smiled at her and told her I do not understand her joke. She was a little disappointed. 
 Can someone explain the joke to me?

                              <span>Anyone else encounter extremely rude native Korean tourists? We’ve been going to Korean dense cities &amp; I’ve noticed they’re very rude. And I know they’re Korean because I can hear them speak it.
 **I’m not saying it’s only native Koreans, but most of my interactions have been this way. I never experience this with Korean Americans back home, rich or middle class, so that’s why I’m so culture shocked by this behavior!
 Examples:
 Usually people move aside or try to avoid hitting the other person when walking opposite directions on a sidewalk.
  
I’ve been very harshly shoved by the shoulders or arms by Korean tourists who don’t even attempt to avoid me even when I try to avoid them. They’ll walk in a straight line, unwaivering, &amp; will shove me hard then keep walking straight without looking back at who they hit. This has happened on multiple occasions where they can easily avoid hitting me as I try to avoid them.
  
Waiting
  
When waiting in line, I’ll just have a random Korean person shove their way in front of me as if I don’t exist. Same thing if I’m looking at something, but I’m standing to the side to allow others to walk by. 
 They’ll stand close &amp; right in front of the displays, blocking me even though it’s clear I’m looking &amp; trying to grab something.
  
Seats
  
At busy buffets, they’ll deny you sitting at the end of their empty table &amp; far away by saying it’s full. Meanwhile, it’s empty the entire time we’re there. 
  
I haven’t experienced that with British, American, or Uzbek tourists at all. It’s literally just native Koreans. It’s driving me nuts! ESPECIALLY being hit &amp; shoved! Teens don’t really do it, children I get, mid-20’s-60’s+ do it without care.

                              <span>I know this has been asked a million times but the laws are constantly changing on this. What are the rules about names currently? I’ve heard that people used to do Vietnamese family name, English name, Vietnamese name. That way the child basically has two first names and can choose which one to use based on where they are. 
 Then I saw there was a new law that said they can only have an English family name. This makes no sense to me because no one in Vietnam would know how to pronounce my last name, and no one in America would call a child by their last name. 
 Are there other options? Can we register the baby’s name with the US first and then with Vietnam to force them to accept a different name?

For context, I am a Vietnamese American and my wife is a Vietnamese Australian and we are not too familiar with the city since we both left at a very young age. We will be staying in District 4 and I want to plan out things to do and places to eat. If possible, I want to avoid tourist places. Any suggestions?

 Are aunties and mothers and grandmothers constantly trying to get their younger relatives married off? Or is this an outdated worldview? Would they try to get a younger woman with a much older unmarried man, if he was successful, even if the age difference was extreme, or do they mostly leave them alone?

                              <span>Currently in Phu Quoc and have been staying around Grand World. Can someone explain what’s going on here? The food seems so sketchy with not that many people eating here. What I thought was a 7-11 was actually a 7-7. What I thought was a Baskin Robbin’s was just a random shop. The Lotteria…is this even real or just a fake too?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a question regarding Names in Vietnam and how to address the person properly when writing Mails, Letters etc. 
 The name is Ho Thi Kieu Phuong. So far I figured out that Ho is the Family Name and Thi is middle name addressing the gender. So should I be writing &quot;Dear Thi Kieu Phuong&quot; or just &quot;Dear Kieu Phuong&quot; or any other variation of those names? 
 Bonus Question would be about the Meaning of the Name. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know the Name in vietnamese alphabet, but hope it&#x27;s still solvable. 
 I appreciate any help with it!

                              <span>Hi, I am a student studying about Vietnam Education. I was looking for details but I couldn&#x27;t find anything online, so I resorted to ask here and talk to someone literally from Vietnam
 ​
 My questions are fairly basic and short and might ask more
 ​
 What is the Time Allotment in Vietnam Schools? (The schedule for the day) (Grades 1 - 12)
 What are the Aims or Goals in Vietnam Education?
 ​
 I might ask more but these 2 questions are more important! Thank you!

A bit less common with foreign female with Viet male, but it’s there. However I find it rare to ever hear about Viet Kieu/Viet American female with Viet male, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.
 I&#x27;m a Viet American female, early 30&#x27;s, I want to stay humble and not to toot my own horn, but because I have self awareness and have done the work of constantly being open to growing and improving on whatever on myself, I know I&#x27;m a conventionally attractive person that is pleasant to be around.

Especially this lovely guy, we get on great but when ever he eat, he eat with his mouth close, like super close you can&#x27;t tell if he&#x27;s chewing. He doesn&#x27;t make any noise to indicate he&#x27;s enjoying my food. That&#x27;s so rude! How can I politely tell him that if he doesn&#x27;t like my cooking he doesn&#x27;t need to eat it?

 Ill start: I know one of the English teachers recalling his story. He was teaching about holidays and used White day (valentines) as a example. One of the students then asked if White day is like Black History month but for white people?💀

                              <span>I met a very nice lady. She&#x27;s very sweet, and we can have conversations for hours. She dresses nice, exercises, and eats healthy. She&#x27;s very classy and everything seems great except she chews with her mouth open. And not a little, a lot. We had lunch yesterday and she didn&#x27;t even try to keep it closed, and talked a lot with food in there. If I were to mention this to her, she might consider it losing face and would probably ghost me.
 How can I get a nice lady to chew with her mouth closed?

                              <span>Hi, Flying into Danang in mid-january. reserve 2 nights in Hoi An and then 1 in Hue. From there I plan on riding south along Truong Son Dong Rd towards Dalat and back up the Ho Chi Minh Road to Danang (reserved night). Do you think I need to reserve lodging along the 2 roads or can I keep it fluid? rough overnights below, I know these are kinda long distances so open to advice on shorten if you think much to aggressive as I want to max at 6hour days. Dalat may be too far and cut over after Ayon Pa to Buon Ma Thuot for day 4
 ​
 Thank you in advance
 ​
 Truong Son Dong Rd
 Day 1; Hue to Thanh My
 Day 2: ride to Son Tay
 Day 3: ride to Ayun Pa
 Day 4: ride to Dalat
 ​
 Ho Chi Minh Rd
 Day5: Dalat to Buon Ma Thuot
 Day 6: ride to Kon Tum
 Day 7. Ride to Da Nang

                              <span>do you find it easy to tell from physical appearance when someone is southern chinese or vietnamese? are there any features that make it clearer to distinguish? my friend is from guangdong and im viet and we honestly look so similar most ppl (chinese or vn) couldn’t tell who’s from where, we’ve both even been mistaken for filipino before. in your experience is it usually easy to distinguish most of the time, or are there cases where it’s more ambiguous?

I see that Ho Chi Minh City FC have a game tomorrow, but I can’t see anywhere online to buy tickets. Is it possible for tourists to buy tickets? And if so where would be the best place to do this? Are home fans welcoming to tourists also? Any advise would be greatly appreciated!!

                              <span>My family is coming back to Vietnam in January and this time we have more kids so we plan to get a small van to go around because we do not live in cities (no Grab and taxis are expensive and inconvenient). My wife can drive for a year with an IDP but eventually we plan to get a driver license for both of us. I am Vietnamese and my wife is not but she can communicate in Vietnamese decently.
 For me, I know absolutely nothing about driving a car (or about a car itself). I also want to learn to drive decently and safely and we will not bribe. What can we do to prepare ahead? I heard there are some test apps online, does it make sense for me to learn them first before actually get to class? TIA.

                              <span>I have a couple of vietnamese friends and I want to learn the language for fun. Probably not in depth but just vocabulary, how to say common everyday phrases, and pronunciation/grammar. I heard duolingo is not accurate, but I want to learn correctly and maybe just know how to read specifically southern. I already know how to speak chinese so I dont know if that helps
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all.
 I&#x27;m heading to VN in a few months, I will be in Danang, Hoi An day trip, Hanoi, Cantho, and Sgn. I&#x27;m looking buy a couple of items from VN, but i would prefer not going to the market w/aggressivve vendors and negotiation hazzels.
 Here are items I like to buy: pepper, banh trang, coffee beans, dry bamboo (mang kho), and any squid and dry shrimp, I believe these are acceptable items for US. 
 Do you have a reiablie vendor recommendation? Or if you have any other recommendation to bring back to US, I muchly appreciated.
 Also - is it safe to use CC in Grab? I have friends that pay cash instead of paying cc thru app. I hate carrying cash :)
 Thank you.

                              <span>Do any of those made in Vietnam stores sell authentic products? 
 I was convinced that everything in them is fake but I recently purchased some Barbour jackets that are excellent quality and could very likely be authentic.

                              <span>So I carry this with me for quite a while already: 
 I live in Vietnam, and a friend of mine, around 30, from a European country, told me in 2021 already the he need to get to Saigon to his embassy to get a new passport. Quite difficult during Covid, he also doesn’t have big cash to pay for the trip, so he kept on delaying it, until his passport ran out of validity. 
 In early 2023 he made the trip to Saigon finally by taking the train, told me he can’t fly because no passport, so Train best option. When he came back from that trip a couple days later I asked him about passport and if he got his, he told me not yet, embassy have problems bla bla bla. 
 Since then, he told me like three times on different occasions that he moved into a new place under his girlfriends name and kinda hides from immigration and doesn’t really care. If that’s true, we talking about a looooong overstay. 
 So my question: 
 1.) I feel he‘s telling me BS, but why would make shit like that up. What’s the intention??
 2.) Assume he‘s telling the truth, what „problems“ could his embassy make to not give him a new passport?
 3.) Could he really „hide“ from VN police and just overstay months without them seeking for him / finding him? What’s the play here, they actively looking for him or just waiting and hope they catch him one day? He‘s not really „quiet“ about his situation so I know the circle of people Knowing is not small either and I just can’t imagine they not knowing and not caring and not finding.
 This whole story is so damn stupid and I can’t make sense of it. Really looking to hear some fresh opinions on that.
 Edit: Could be he meant „consulate“ instead, I know a lot of people use the word „embassy“ but actually meaning „consulate“, so that’s not the big issue here. 
 Edit 2: Thanks for the replies guys!

                              <span>How strict is Vietnam with &quot;putting yourself out there&quot;?
 In Indonesia, you can technically be deported for pretty much anything
  
Looking for a roommate, e. g. making a social media post is illegal
 Being a guest speaker at an event, even if non-paid for a volunteer-based organization
 Performing music, poetry, or doing a comedy skit at some bar/open mic can be considered illegal 
 Even having a YouTube channel that makes no money is theoretically deportable
 Meeting business owners to ask them about business collaborations (just hypothetical ones)
  
So, Indonesia is very strict. Will all of these scenarios always get enforced? No. You probably won&#x27;t get deported if you perform some music at an open mic. But it&#x27;s technically possible.
 How is it here in Vietnam?
 I&#x27;m in the meeting business owners boat. Ironically, I flew here to Vietnam because it&#x27;s just very hard to open a business in Indonesia while you&#x27;re in the country, so I thought I&#x27;d do it remotely. But now I end up seriously liking it here. It&#x27;s more foreigner-friendly here, at least from my first impressions. 
 I&#x27;m thinking about talking to some businesses about my business ideas for their feedback/thoughts on the ideas. How strict is Vietnam with &quot;advertising yourself&quot;/&quot;putting yourself out there&quot;? I wouldn&#x27;t be making any money, this is just to validate if I could try something out, at which point I guess I&#x27;d have to open a business, or fly out and do something via a German business.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>After back and forth with the driver on Google translate I asked if tolls can be included and increase in the app? He say OK and start ride. I am still in the car ride with about 2h to go and not sure when/if he is gonna ask for money and what is correct? 800k for tolls sounds to high and like he tries to scam me. Is the passenger supposed to pay for tolls on Grab? Anyway what should I do?
 EDIT: Arrived at the hotel and he was demanding extra money for the ride, lucky the there were lots of hotel staff around as I wouldn&#x27;t have felt safe otherwise. He even followed us to the lobby trying again and again asking to be added as tip etc. I rated the ride 1 star and write a report to grab about it. thanks for the help if I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten such great replies he probably would have gotten money from me as I wasn&#x27;t sure and I would have pitied him.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am planning to go Vietnam in January with Bamboo airline. I am from Sydney Australia. My travel agent said that bamboo airlines went bankrupt and all flights are cancelled I checked online but my flight is still there. I check the website every thing seems normal. Is this true? Is this something I should be concerned about?

                              <span>I don’t know how common this is, but this happened to me just yesterday after living here for about 7 years.
 So I was at an ATM pulling out cash, when I was done there was a man behind me and asked me to help him get his money out of his card. My first thought was that he’s trying to scam me or some other trick, who the hell asks a random stranger to pull money out of their card for them? I looked at him and he looks a little rough, probably a laborer from his clothes and calloused hands, and maybe an ethnic minority as well. He also looked honest and sincere so I thought fuck it, why not. He gave me his card, so I showed him step by step instructions on how to use an ATM, including the part where I told him to put in his PIN in secret and he blurbed out load to me 666666, I was just like bruh 😳. Anyways, we finished it up and he thanked me profusely, then left. I was just standing there dumbfounded that this dude would put so much trust in me regarding his personal finances, someone could have definitely taken advantage of him.
 Would you say this is a weird incident or is this more common than I thought?

                              <span>Like in English, I always think it’s strange to not have two separate words for “chúng tôi“ and “chúng ta” (“we” can include or exclude the person listening).
 Or in French, the counting system is infamously odd.
 It’s not about right or wrong, or which language is better. It’s about finding interesting things that native speakers might not notice.
 So what are some things you find peculiar, or confusing, or things that don’t make any sense to you in Vietnamese?
 Edit: I find the topic has been shifted to &quot;what do you find difficult in Vietnamese&quot; haha. Can we have more answers about some words or phrases or language features you find odd please? actually both directions are welcome, feel free to share

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always tended towards healthy food as a choice.
 However this year my stomach has been giving me a lot of trouble (3 years in Vietnam)
 Had it checked - no ulcer, etc. My blood pressure has also gone up.
 So, what are healthy, easily available breakfast/lunch/dinner options?
 Light, nutritious, comforting.
 (I don&#x27;t have a kitchen, so I eat out)

                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;m a Belgian student who&#x27;s coming to Vietnam later this year (march, for 2 weeks!) for a school project. I&#x27;m going to Hô Chi Minh International University.
 I&#x27;m really excited and want to make the most out of it. But I&#x27;m quite unfamiliar with Vietnamese culture, let alone language. I started to learn with duolingo, you know, the basic stuff. But I rlly want to know if there is some things I gotta do. Some do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts I might not be familiar with, or any reccomendations are welcome!!

                              <span>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember any of the lyrics, since I&#x27;m not fluent in Vietnamese. But I did try making a portion of the song in FL Studio, in the hope that someone might be able to recognise it:
 What&#x27;s the name of this Vietnamese song? - YouTube 
 Another thing I can remember was that this song was sung by a guy, dancing on stage together with a girl and the performance involved dancing in front of a giant projector curtain and sometimes walk behind it, as if they&#x27;re &quot;entering&quot; the screen world and switching back to the real world basically. Hope that makes sense

                              <span>Like the title said, how do you find one that isn&#x27;t &quot;uniform fee&quot; or &quot;water fee&quot; and still have at least 4 mil salary upward? Every where i go is the same old thing of we dont have fee but you still need to give us fee.
 And when I does give in, the goddam &quot;employer&quot; made me drive my mother(job for my mom, she retire from selling phở - now i kinda regret not forcing her to stay) all around the city to &quot;receive uniform&quot;, to meet manager and to WAIT. And in my case, they force me to buy there expensive drink when i literally have no need for ones. Like literally, I dont ask for much, just a mundane job, how do you find one here? 
 Edit: I am college student in desperate need for a job in hcm city and im really tired of meeting scams all over the places

                              <span>Hi! I’ve been invited to a wedding this January and want to make sure my wedding outfit doesn’t offend. I am not sure how conservative to dress or if there is a specific guest attire etiquette I should follow. For example, in the US females shouldn’t wear white dresses, only the bride. Would this dress work?

                              <span>Hey reddit,
 My neighbor across the street runs a restaurant. Usually theyre nice and all, no problem. The problem are the guests and staffs that keeps parking their bike IN FRONT of our gate which prevent our vehicles from moving in or out. This happened on many occasion despite many times we remind them. Is there a way we can resolve this permanently? I thought of calling local police and ask if they want a free bike but i doubt theyd do much. Destroying the bike would definitely get things more complicated.
 What would yall do?

 Thousands of years ago, during the reign of King Kinh Dương Vương, the Xích Quỷ kingdom was an unknown stretch of a vast land on the far East, leaning its back on a range of high mountains while looking out facing the oceans from a long shoreline. He married princess Long Nữ, the daughter of Động Đình Vương - sovereign of the Động Đình Lake. They were then blessed with one child, a boy whom they called Sung Lam, popularly known in the kingdom as Lạc Long Quân, the &quot;Dragon Lord of Lạc”. Because of Long Nữ’s origin, their son was believed to be a descendant from the line of the Dragons. And indeed, Lạc Long Quân had extraordinary strength and supreme intelligence. But his succession from his mother’s underwater world developed in him a strong fascination…</span>

 Second hand embarrassment. Trying to be funny but failing. Thinking oneself very cool/sexy.
 Is there I word I can use in Vietnamese to make my wife understand?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Perhaps it looks an stupid question, but we are a couple planning to go to VN the second half of Nov, and we are roach-phobic. We&#x27;ve seen many post here and there talking about this thing there: it is a south east Asia country, and face cockroaches is likely inevitable. Would you consider not travelling because of this? 
 We are searching for higher end hotels in Hanoi, Ninh Bihn and Hoi An because of this, but even the best rated ones in Booking (e.g. 9,1 - 1,3k reviews) can have a comment of cockroach found. Again, it might sound stupid, but we found cockroaches in the past and completely ruined our trips. What are your thoughts and experiences? thanks a lot

                              <span>I&#x27;ll go ahead and ask the question many foreigners are itching to ask. Why do we have 2 Women&#x27;s Days in VN? 
 Is it something related to Lunar Calendar? Because i don&#x27;t see the same occassion in other countries like China, Singapore, Hong Kong. Or is there a deeper historical background to this?
 Also how does it differ from Valentine&#x27;s Day &amp; International Women&#x27;s Day?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a 22 year old Vietnamese Canadian. I moved to Canada at 16, just finished my university degree in STEM. Due to the housing market in Canada, I am considering moving back to Vietnam where my parents are quite well off and where I can actually afford to own a house in my lifetime.

I do not know how to socialize or flirt in Vietnamese. For example in Canada I can strike up a conversation with literally anyone with just a &quot;How are you doing today?&quot;, I don&#x27;t think such phrases exist in Vietnamese?

 My kid will be in Hanoi soon and just in case, she may running out of cash, can she uses her Bank of America ATM/Debit card to take out cash there? 
 Is it better/safer to bring her ATM/Debit card or her credit card to w/d cash as needed in Vietnam/Hanoi?
 Thanks all.

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 I wanted to ask for advice on what to do and where to eat on my 48 hour layover here starting Friday night. I will be staying at the Vinpearl 81. I leave Sunday afternoon. 
 Also, will grab be available if I arrive at 9pm to the Tan Son Nhat International Airport (SGN)? What should I expect for pricing?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hey everyone, my girlfriend and I will be traveling throughout Vietnam for all of December from north (Hanoi) to south (Saigon). 
 Despite being British, I actually grew up in Vietnam, from when I was 9 to 18. I left in 2012 and haven’t been back since - so I’m extremely excited to come back home! :) I’m sure I’ll be shocked at how much has changed! It’s also my girlfriend’s first time in the country. 
 We’re going to be spending Christmas in HCMC (where I grew up), and before that well be in Hoi An. I’m wondering where we can go after for 1.5 weeks of relax. We want a nice beach destination with some beautiful properties, activities, maybe some historical sites, nice restaurants, and somewhere to celebrate the new year! 
 When I was growing up, my parents and I would take quick weekend trips from HCMC to Mui Ne/Vung Tau for the beach, but I’m not sure these are the best options. 
 We heard mixed reviews about Phu Quoc, but everyone is suggesting Da Nang! What do you all recommend? Keeping in mind it’s end of December/January. 
 Any place in particular? Would appreciate ANY help! :)) 
 Cam on!

                              <span>I remember going to Vietnam 10 years ago and having KFC but the ketchup was noticeably less sweeter and savory compared to American ketchup. I recalled my parents saying it had something to do with the fertilizer used in Vietnam.
 ​
 Does anyone notice the difference in taste? I&#x27;m not sure of what subsidies Vietnam has on any kinds of foods but does Vietnam simply not make their ketchup sweet?

                              <span>I visited Vietnam for 3 weeks. It was my first time in SEA and it all happened because of random occurrences. I literally booked my flight and did an emergency VOA 4 days prior to entering the country. Thankfully all went well and before I knew it I found myself wandering the streets of Hanoi being absolutely amazed by everything I saw. 
 What I did: 
 The first few days I rented a motorbike to get around the city which to me counts as one of the most dangerous yet funnest things I&#x27;ve ever done abroad. The traffic is chaotic and danger imposing at almost all times yet it still flows and creates amazing experiences, given you know how to handle a motorbike + stress situations. I tried to drive as carefully and defensive as possible yet was still humbled every now and then when passing big i…</span>

                              <span>I teach a brand new elective class at my American middle school this year and I need some help finding a craft or art project for our section on Vietnam. The class is a little bit cultural awareness, a little bit foods, a little bit history. We did two weeks learning about Mexican culture, foods, holidays, and that section ended with the kids building a piñata. 
 For the Vietnamese section, I want to have a similar format so I’d like to end on some sort of craft or art project that is authentic. Some of my students are Vietnamese so I really want to get this right (I’d want to get it right regardless but I feel a little more pressure lol).
 Any ideas? For reference I’m teaching mostly 7th and 8th graders (12/13 years old). Any ideas or input would be super appreciated!

                              <span>Going back home I randomly stumbled this fancy looking structure. Anyone knows what this is? It&#x27;s near Doji Tower.
 I was too shy to ask the grab driver to stop lol and I don&#x27;t want to cause trouble to him too, at the same time I can only speak very very little Vietnamese. 😅 I&#x27;m just curious what this is.

 If you had a Vietnamese girlfriend is it common to give a gift? Or is it like international where it&#x27;s just kind of acknowledged?

                              <span>I&#x27;m speaking from experience and I might sound insensitive for assuming this. I apologize if this is inaccurate or 
 So my Vietnamese ex-girlfriend saids that guy should always apologize first regardless if they&#x27;re right or wrong. Especially in an argument. He would always need to &quot;nhường nhịn&quot; her. I know that my ex was not the only one with this idea, because I saw TikTok have a lot of posts about this. But most Western culture would say that communication is key and both side would need to find a middle ground to talk and apologize to each other
 In a breakup, my ex wants me to &quot;dỗ dành&quot; and &quot;níu kéo&quot; her. But Western culture would say go no contact and severe any contact. 
 I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a right or wrong, it&#x27;s just a matter of difference in culture (I guess).

                              <span>We came back from Mount Fansipan with the cablecar waiting for our cab to pick us up at the parking lot. A taxi driver approached us with a pic of us when we were arriving (we were walking into the gate). Our actual driver texted me at that moment, so i assume this was some trick, but it felt kind of eerie. 
 Moral of the story: make sure you know what your driver looks like! We confirmed with our hotel that this was not the guy. Might seem straightforward but we almost fell for it. Maybe someone else will use this as a cautionary tale :)

According to them, the South generates most of the revenue and the North exploits it. Do war torn divisions still run deep?

                              <span>Is there any evidence that Vietnam is buying A800/H800 AI GPUs? If so, who is? Is there an AI startup here or is it becuase they are actually destined for China? I dont get it as Vietnam does not appear to be in the AI race, but I would love to see it as we when everyone has AGI, no one will have the advantage. 
 The future of AI is Open Source anyways so all these bans really only slow down big corps who are destined to loose the race to open source anyways.

 I&#x27;m looking for some resources to learn southern vietnamese. I have already searched on Google/Reddit and asked on Discord, but the amount of resources are very limited, especially for trying to learn southern vietnamese, so I&#x27;m posting on reddit to see if there&#x27;s any other resources.
 I understand there&#x27;s more resources for the Northern dialect, and that Northern Vietnamese is the standard, but my family/relatives speak Southern, and I&#x27;d like to increase my vocabulary and grammar knowledge. I can speak a little bit, but need to use a lot of English words since I don&#x27;t know many words.
 I&#x27;ve been learning Japanese for ~3 years and got to a decent level, passed N1 …</span>

                              <span>Hey all,
 So I lived in Vn for a few years and I absolutely love the place. 
 I&#x27;m looking at coming back to do business now my country has signed a free trade deal with Vietnam. 
 Some friends and I have been trying to contact various places to establish contact with experts in several fields, and we find more often than not that emails on official websites are either unmonitered or they bounce back as inactive addresses. 
 Now I know that business in Vietnam is very much a face-to-face kind of thing, but we&#x27;re trying to establish some form of rapport before we come over for a expeditionary visit. 
 How do people on the ground deal with this? 
 Are phone calls and not email the primary means of making initial contact with people?
 I&#x27;d appreciate some advice for making contacts in Vietnam before we travel there. 
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m traveling to VN in January and will be there until June or so. I plan to stay in 3-5 cities for about 1-2 months at a time with weekend getaways other times. What do you recommend I travel with? I&#x27;m debating between a large rolling suitcase or buying a 30L-ish travel backpack. 
 I intend to use Grab for getting around and maybe splurging to rent a car for traveling longer distance? I&#x27;m not sure and could use some guidance. I welcome any clarifying questions. Thank you!

 Once I saw like 20 ducks hanging from a bike, more flowers than a florist, and just loads of boxes.

 this will be a small guide for all the people (especially the western tourists) who are active on tinder in the city of Hanoi.
 First of all: Be aware, there are a lot of Scamming Girls active in this city!
 My friend and I got scammed a few days ago and I don’t want anybody else to fall for this kind of tourist trap. My friend matched a cute vietnamese girl on tinder and she said „let’s go eat somewhere“. So far so good. She said she knew a good restaurant in the are, north of Hoan Kiem Lake. As we are 2 guys travelling around my friend asked her to bring a friend. We went out on a date with them and everything seemed to be fine. We got a lot of compliments like „you are handsome boys“ and stuff like this, of course we liked it. Because we are gentlemen, we p…</span>

 Edit: Thank you all very much for the clarification.

 It looks utterly terrifying and something that would never go near my mouth, but was wondering what creature it actually is? 
 Anyone know its name in Vietnamese or English? Or what it tastes like?

 Seems far too expensive than it should be, more than I pay in the UK.
 Could anyone advise am I missing something, or are they taking me for a ride?

                              <span>I am from the UK and am currently in the solo portion of my travels in Vietnam.
 Having just spent 5 days in Da Nang - largely stuck in my hotel room due to torrential rain - I had the bright idea to travel to my next destination (Hoi An) by walking the entire length of the 25km beach on the Da Nang’s east coast.
 It started out great: the weather was nice enough, there were fishermen and families around, and the scenery was perfect for a long hike. I had 2.5L worth of water and OJ with me too, so I was all set.
 However, at around maybe 2/3rds the way - and I didn’t notice at the time, because the transition was quite subtle - it slowly started to become increasingly more uninhabited and barren.
 I only started to realise this when I noticed a presumably stray dog up ahead, and nobody els…</span>

                              <span>The flight timing has not changed. I checked the PNR on Vietjet site and its showing my booking too. The &quot;sorry for this inconvenience&quot; is throwing me off. 
 I&#x27;ve tried calling Vietjet but when I call it says their number is currently busy on another call, I&#x27;ve sent them an email as well.

                              <span>Growing up in America and living in both the Midwest and California, I always thought pho is the most popular dish to Vietnamese since there are way more pho restaurants than any other types. 
 After arriving here in ho chi minh city, I realize that may not be true. I only see a pho place for every 50 com tam, hu tieu place.
 Is it because pho is more appealing to non vietnamese folks? My observation is just in the ho chi minh city region so far, not sure about other regions.

Then, I&#x27;ll transfer money to this account and withdraw it as needed on my trip rather than carry a bunch of cash with me.
 I will be staying in Hanoi if that makes a difference. Thank you

                              <span>I’m going to Vietnam in January (likely staying two months) with a Vietnamese friend (so language barriers won’t be a huge impediment) and I have a lot of ideas for destinations I’d like to see already. Many popular spots, some less popular ones like coffee plantations and some temples. But I am planning to stay in Saigon and Hanoi each for an extended period to immerse myself, meet locals, and learn about the ways lives are lived there. (What other reason is there to travel?) I am wondering if anyone has any useful insights for extended stay in these cities, or even suggestions of other cities or towns which would have much to offer for an immersive stay. For extra context I am a writer, a historian (primarily of race and racism in the United States but with interests far beyond that as well) generally interested in social hierarchies and looking to also learn about the realities of Vietnamese socialism/socialist-oriented capitalism.

                              <span>I’m a tourist planning to visit Da Nang in the last week of October (Oct 29-Nov 01). I see news saying there are heavy floods till Oct 19th. How safe is it to visit ? How will the tourist scene and city scene be ?

                              <span>Booking a cruise to Bai Tu Long Bay on Adoga, has anyone done it? Do you get the same all inclusive package as if you book through a travel agent or the company. It is just so much cheaper on Adoga. Lots of people have said book in person, it&#x27;s cheaper, but I haven&#x27;t seen the in person prices, any insight on that would also be helpful.

                              <span>Remember Remember the 5th of November...
 Because that is when this unique board game convention takes place!
 Though board games have been a part of Vietnam&#x27;s past time for a while, with traditional games like cờ tướng (Chinese chess) or ô ăn quan (Square Capturing), mordern board games are relatively new to the mass audience. As such, there have not been many big events dedicated to this awesome hobby.
 Started out as a local event for tabletop gamers, we are bringing back Board Game Fest for the 3rd time, this time on a scale bigger than ever before. With 150 game tables, hundred of board games and several dozen of Game Master and staff, we hope this will be a welcoming event for everyone, young and old, Vietnamese and foreigners alike. There will be many booths with all the big board game coffees in Hanoi, leading board game publishers from Vietnam where you can experience their games/ services. Whether you are new to board game and want to try out some amazing-looking games; or want to check out some of our never-before-seen self-published titles; or just want to hang out and potentially meet someone who shares your interest, there is something for you at our event.
 The event venue will be at TH School - yes that&#x27;s the beautiful pink building right on Chua Boc street. Book your tickets now to enjoy the best deal (we are only selling tickets to provide a big nice venue for the event). Details in the poster below!
 If you&#x27;re anyway interested and have further question, feel free to reach me via PM or via our FB page. Our team want make this a meaningful annual event and help grow the tabletop community, so I really hope you will consider joining our tables, and hope we will have a great time together!!

                              <span>Khi đi lướt qua ngã tư Giải Phóng - Trường Chinh, ta có thể bắt gặp hình ảnh một số quầy bán xăng được chứa trong bình nhựa bày la liệt trước cửa hàng xăng dầu (cửa hàng đang để biển ngưng nhập hàng). Đôi khi tôi còn thấy chính những nhân viên bán xăng ra ngồi quầy. Có thể thấy rằng hành vi này thực sự xấu, nó nguy hiểm khi người dân thi nhau tàng trữ chất gây cháy nổ và không hề có biện pháp phòng ngừa, nó thực sự gây hoang mang cho tôi, cảm tưởng như rằng chúng ta sắp hết sạch xăng và không có gì để dùng khi đó việc kinh doanh như vậy sẽ đem lại nhiều lợi nhuận. Mong tình trạng này sớm được giải quyết và thu nhỏ.

                              <span>My landlord has various altars around the house. They all have an array of flashing multicolour lights that are on 24/7. 
 The small altar downstairs at the entrance of the house is particularly annoying, because it&#x27;s always in the corner of my eye. My bedroom door is glass so I can see the lights flashing all the time when I go to bed at night. 
 What is the purpose of the lights? Is it really important they always be on? I&#x27;m wondering if it would be a big deal if I turned off the lights at night, and just made sure to turn them on again when my landlord comes to pray. As far as I know it&#x27;s the money altar, it&#x27;s not the main ancestral altar, that one is upstairs.
 Edit: thanks for the feedback, I won&#x27;t interfere with the altar

 Im traveling and recently had a guide tell me that the average person in Vietnam does not pay taxes unless they work for the government. He didn’t really seem willing to explain further than that, so we didn’t ask. Is it true that most people don’t pay taxes in Vietnam? 
 If so, how are infrastructure projects funded and who pays government employees salaries? I don’t mean to sound ignorant, just genuinely curious. Thank you!

                              <span>I can&#x27;t be the only one thinking about this, Vietnam has a 40% market share for iPhones, but this doesn&#x27;t make sense with the current wages in Vietnam. Some quick numbers here for discussion:
 Cheapest iPhone 15 listed: $799
 Average monthly salary in VN: $733
 iOS Market Share in VN: 40%
 Average monthly salary in Singapore: $6,324
 iOS Market Share in Singapore: 34%
 Average monthly salary in Malaysia: $1,485
 iOS Market Share in Malaysia: 33%
 An intern of mine bought an iPhone 15 for 4x her monthly salary, and is willing to finance it through a 12 months installment. This obsession is pretty fascinating to me, so local peeps please weigh in. But here&#x27;s my 2 cent: if you need to finance a mobile phone, then you&#x27;re not financially capable of owning it.

                              <span>Hi, I usually flying solo and I want to know if vietnam is safe enough for woman to travel alone. 
 I usually visit landmark places and sometime nightlife, also any recommendations on good scenery coffee café could be nice too.
 Is there anything I should be concern of? For example; any dress code or things I shouldn&#x27;t wear in public, public transportation, dining, any precautious welcome!

 My thoughts are Mekong Delta region would be swarmed with hordes of zombies and would be really dangerous to live. Crowed Cities like HCMC or Hanoi would be totally infected in just a couple of days considering the population density.
 Vietnamese dont have guns. So people would be defenseless. Its dangerous to engage zombies in a melee combat. Except groups of ex militants. But zombies are not good as traversing hard terrain. And Vietnam is full of such terrain,85% of territory is mountain so if you just go and make a settlement in a sloppy area. You should be safe. Except for anomalies.
 Best thing i can think of to do is go to high altitude area. A really high place.I would like move to North West or Tay Nguyen regions. Fansipan is a good choice.The Mainly hunting or can even cultivate if you have some offensive weapons to take dons a couple of zombies that might appear. My choice is live on the top of terraced fields so you never worry about food.Vietnam would be among the safest places against zombie. If you have some resources to sustain your self in remote hard terrain.

                              <span>Hi guys, hope this is within the community rules. I&#x27;m now living in the UK but need a Vietnamese Police clearance because I lived there for a year in 2011. I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble with the Ministry of Justice not picking up the phone or answering my emails. The embassy in London says they have nothing to do with the process apart from witnessing me sign the documents and stamping them. Has anyone else had this experience? At this point I&#x27;m willing to pay for an agency which could help and make this easier.

                              <span>From my perspective as a 23 year old, I support innovation in education. Professor Ho Ngoc Dai, as a prominent figure in education reforming who had gone through the hard times in Vietnam, even consider children like a friend, once said &quot;if you consider them like a friend, then you can&#x27;t scold them&quot;. Unfortunately, majority of people in Vietnam and even ppl of my age still support this way of &quot;education&quot;, like wtf how can you say you beat them because you &quot;care&quot; about them, which is total hypocrisy. And then the &quot;backthen we got beaten and that gave us success&quot; mentality, which is totally survivorship bias because those people only got like good job with average income, maybe higher because backthen there were more opportunities due to booming economy in early 90s and 2000s. And if the method works then why is corruption and crime is still rampant in the country? 
 Of course this is a cultural issue, and I&#x27;m sure that many people may be triggered and even compare to the US or something. And yes, Vietnam is no doubt a part of sinosphere where collectivism and conservatism is widespread, people don&#x27;t change much and clings to Confucian values much like the way Islamists clings to orthodox view. So what is your thoughts ? Do you support change ?

                              <span>I own a couple of restaurants in HCMC, and I fired someone for so many reasons. On his way out, he stole my recipe book. He then opened a new restaurant, called it almost the same thing, and is selling my menu. I wouldn&#x27;t normally care, because my food is still better, but I keep getting messages from customers complaining about the food thinking it&#x27;s mine. 
 The name is different enough that it doesn&#x27;t violate any copyrights/trademarks, while the recipes are recipes I created myself, apparently there is no copyright on recipes? I&#x27;m told that there is nothing that can legally be done about it.
 So, is there anything legal that can be done about it?

                              <span>Hi all
 According to my guide book (Le Routard), plenty of excursions should be on offer in all the travel agencies to the several traditional hand craft villages around Hanoi. However, speaking to multiple of these agencies today, it appears most of them don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m talking about... Closest I got was a half day scooter tour to Bat Trang. I can find some info online, but also on here it&#x27;s rarely mentioned. 
 What I was looking/hoping for was a day-tour where you get to visit 3to4 of these villages and can experience/whitness the different craftsman in action.
 Is this maybe not a thing anymore? Is the info in my guide outdated? Has anyone on here ever visited (some of) these villages and was it worth it? Which ones would you recommend?
 Thanks! Grts from Hanoi 👋

                              <span>I am planning to visit Vietnam during the last week of November for 10 days with two friends from College. Our itinerary looks like Da Nang- Hoi An - Phong Nha - Hanoi- Halong Bay - Sapa. Planning to spend two days in sapa including catcat village. Are the villages really crowded during this time? Which are the villages which i should visit? And how will the weather be?

                              <span>So I’m currently on vacation in HCMC and my plan right now is to fly out to Da Nang the day after tomorrow and get a taxi to Hoi An for a few days.
 I’ve been read the news about all the rain and flooding that’s happening and I’m wondering if anybody in the region can tell me if it’ll be safe to still do this.

                              <span>I plan to visit some remote regions (countryside, mountains, away from cities) of Vietnam in the nearby future. 
 I haven’t had a sip of tap water at all in SEA but have heard other people say they have without any consequences. 
 I’d like to know from you! 
 Do you drink tap water in Vietnam? If so, where do you get it from? Do you advise travelers to drink tap water in remote regions of Vietnam? 
 (For clarity, I have no problem buying water but I like to get honest opinions from locals and other seasoned travelers, and not the copy and paste blog posts of todays computer travelers). Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Saigon just a couple of weeks and my lungs feel like they&#x27;re on fire. 
 Walking down the street, the fumes from the thousands of motorbikes zooming by actually make me nauseous and I have to hold my breath while walking. I can even smell them from inside my apartment. I was planning to take a job here, but don&#x27;t think I can since this is such a big deal for me and affects my physical and mental health. (I also love walking, and this city is probably level 99 difficulty for pedestrians) 
 The noise pollution is pretty bad and I can&#x27;t sleep. There are bikes outside with loudspeakers blaring the same line over and over. I&#x27;ve stayed in four different apartments and every single one has had loud construction noise from 6am-10pm, every day. Even on Sunday. I was once woke up by hammering noise from inside another apartment at 2am! It seems inescapable. I noticed my ears are ringing when inside when it&#x27;s silent. Everything is so loud here. 
 That&#x27;s manageabke though. The worst for me is the air. Although it&#x27;s pretty good in general compared to hanoi, the traffic just overrides that. 
 When is the metro expected to be built? My daily transportation spending was lower in Singapore than in Saigon 🙁
 Is there any area with low traffic and good air quality? Has anyone else felt the bad effects of pollution since moving here?

                              <span>Hi everyone. 
 We are looking to do some ongoing volunteer work in Vietnam. Either with animals or children. Preferably in HCMC. 
 Does anyone have any recommendations? 
 I have searched Google and found a few places but we aren&#x27;t sure.

 Cơ mà tìm hiểu kỹ thì đợt trước e thấy mời một bà hoạ sĩ khác về chủ yếu là để cosplay (thông tin thu thập từ video có thể không hoàn chỉnh). Mà bà hoạ sĩ lần này mời về thì cũng nổi tiếng cái trào lưu “artist vs art”, trên page thì cũng nhấn mạnh cái này vài lần nên là e sợ lần này cũng chỉ cosplay thôi.
 Nói chung là e chưa đi fest AniAni bao giờ nên cũng chỉ phỏng đoán được dựa trên lượng thông tin ít ỏi có trên mạng thôi, mong những bác nào đã đi rồi chia sẻ cho e ít kinh nghiệm với

                              <span>Is there any tour groups that do the loop where you can use a quad bike rather than a scooter.
 My wife’s never rode a bike before and is a little bit sceptical about doing the loop however advised she’d do it if it was on a quad.
 She doesn’t want to do it with another rider and I don’t want to do it on a bike with her on the back of me as i think I’d enjoy it more myself on a bike.
 And we would prefer a group rather than self hiring.

                              <span>Hey guys, I was always wondering what people in socialist countries think of socialism or the concept of Marxism, I thought Vietnam would be the best to ask the question. 
 Obviously asking people in the r/Vietnam subreddit won&#x27;t get nearly correct answers as people here tend to be more influenced by Western English media but despite that I&#x27;m curious at least what the userbase here think/what they see in the country.
 Mainly I want to know it is because I am a Marxist and uphold countries like Vietnam because of how well they progressed and despite Doi Moi I see it as an effect of proletarian power. My country itself was heavily progressing from awful living conditions during socialism but unfortunately we had system change.
 TL;DR: How do you/the average Vietnamese feel about socialism (if there even is in Vietnam after Doi Moi) and Marxist theory?

After a few months I&#x27;m now a regular in the open mic scene here. So I wanna make a list of coffee shops and pubs that host open mics night in Hanoi and the days they occur. If anyone has any questions, please give me a shout-out.
 Here are some notes:
  
Vietnamese open mics are often quite restraint and polite, there are a lot of shy wanna be singers, but it’s just a glorified stripped down acoustic karaoke session with pianos and acoustic guitars, so unless you bring your own stuff, it’s mostly just that to show your singing and instrumentalist skills
 Western open mics are quite fun, exuberant and chaotic due to the presence of a stage for electric instrum…</span>

                              <span>My Vietnamese friend based in Ho Chi Minh has been undergoing some life and financial challenges lately. I don&#x27;t speak Vietnamese and my doesn&#x27;t speak English, so most of the time I use Google Translate to carry out a conversation. Whenever my friend feels down and out, she always says &quot;tôi chán quá&quot;, which translates to &quot;I&#x27;m so bored&quot; in English. Did she really mean bored or should I take it as she feels depressed?

                              <span>I had a rather confusing encounter in Ho Chi Minh awhile back. I was walking around Ben Thanh market at around 0900hrs and went to stop at a store, I normally would say Hi or Xin Chao and proceed to ask the price of the item. 
 I noticed the sellers will ask how many item do you want to buy first instead of the price tag. I then ask again how much is it, she said something along the line “Morning price, first customer you don’t say that to me, I sell to you, how many do you want to buy?” 
 Since she didn’t answer my question, I told her I will come back and walk off. 
 Was I rude? Is there a cultural thing or is it rude to ask how much are the price of items here? 😅

                              <span>Hey Reddit, I&#x27;m currently backpacking across S. E. Asia and done the whole of Vietnam on a bike and loved it. I want to do it across the other countries I plan on visiting. Can I buy a motorbike in HCMC and take it through Cambodia, Laos and then Thailand as long as I get the blue card? Or would I be stopped at borders etc?

                              <span>Hello, sorry my writing skills are still a bit trash so i’m writing in english, but if you prefer to comment in vn i can try to reply in vn. i live in an area that has many viets, as such i go to the hair salon or restaurants and i try to speak vn with them. but i don’t know what i am supposed to call them, i’m 22 and if they seem obviously 60+ i will say cô/chú but sometimes i say chi/anh if they seem like they could be 30ish. but i am bad at reading ages (plus asians look really young) and i don’t know what’s appropriate. my parents are 50ish and everyone in my family who is their generation i would call bác/chú. a lady who was around 65 called herself “chị” and me “em” until she found out i was below 30 and then switched to cô/con🤔but i didn’t want to offend her by saying cô because i’d be calling her kinda old… and what about someone who’s younger than you serving you would you say “em”?
 do you have any tips for differentiating what to call people as to not seem rude or offend them?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 New account due to privacy reasons.
 I cannot wrap my head around VNese housing market. Used to live in Hanoi, HCM and Danang. Currently scouting Danang properties. Seen maybe over 100 various land/houses options within 5-20B range. And it just throws me away, as I cannot see any logic, behind pricing strategy.
 For example, I&#x27;ve came across several options such as 180sqm land cost 7B, and then 2 parallel streets further - 12B or so. In comparison, neighbourhood is the same, surrounding space/layout was similar too.
 The market seems very saturated. Tons of listings for bigger land (150sqm+). With huge price fluctuation (35M/sqm - 70M/sqm).
 My question is, how does one can buy any of this? With current mortgage rates (12-15% after excluding first few years) it&#x27;s a money burn going that route. Further, if I understand correctly, VNmese are not very encouraged to take this route, since rates most of the time we&#x27;re high (~6%), compared with West (1-2%).
 I can only see smaller properties to be in a hot market (3-5B), as it&#x27;s easier to deal via loans/mortgages, but going further, especially 8B+ route - it becomes a madness.
 Given the market in HCM, I&#x27;d see that there is no stop in price increase. I can feel now that it&#x27;s more of a stagnation period. I&#x27;d like to believe, that prices would come down, but at the same time - I feel that greed will be the driver for prices fueling up. However, question appears - how long can this last?
 What I guess, VNese take 7-9% fixed mortgage for 2 years, buy something and try to flip it. Is there any other way, they are able to afford and buy lands/houses for that much?
 What keeps me up at night is that there is just so many listings in Danang, prices seems to be inflated and yet, sellers aren&#x27;t willing to go much lower. However buyers market is definitely not here as well (for at least 8B+ listings).
 Would love to hear your experience and thoughts while navigating this market!

 Các nữ chiến binh thì check in ở những hồ bơi, những khách sạn, những khu du lịch...
 Tại sao có chung một phong cách như vậy nhưng mọi người vẫn bị thao túng tâm lý để từ đó mất tiền ngu như vậy nhỉ.

 I hear it&#x27;s normal to pay for 3 months at a time + deposit. 
 What are some things I can ask for, like a real estate license or ID? What should the contract look like?

                              <span>For anyone traveling to Vietnam, I can only say: the typical “Ninh Binh, Halong, Hơi Ăn, etc.” stops are great in their own right, but the mountainous northwest of the country can make you fall in love. 
 To me, there’s just no place like it. The Viet Bac, the Tay Bac, these places are so alive with culture and the scenery is stunning. 
 There isn’t always as much tourist infrastructure, but if you can ride a motorbike then get on it and go.
 October/November is a wonderful time to travel here. Avoid the rainy seasons due to very real risks of landslides.

                              <span>I need some advice from the community. I want to live in a farmhouse for a week to be closer to nature as a part of therapy for my current bipolar episode. I searched booking dot com &amp; Agoda &amp; found this one with excellent reviews 
 Saigon Garden Homestay 
 Khu phố 2 Tổ 33, KP2, Quận 12,
 Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam
 However, there were no reviews from any expats living in HCMC who stayed there as a weekend getaway or short breaks -- all the reviews were from tourists.
 Has someone lived here? Or, any other options. Any advice? Thanks. I&#x27;m posting 2 images of the property for ref:

                              <span>Greetings,
 I found out Tet in 2024 will be exactly on my birthday, so I&#x27;m tempted to go celebrate both in VN.
 I could go for a week or so. What would the best dates be ? Before Tet or after, or a mix of two ?

                              <span>Hello everyone, looking for some guidance here. I&#x27;ll be brief, explain a little about what direction I&#x27;m heading and my conditions on the ground in Hanoi. Me and my SO have extensive experiences in production/manufacturing/import/export and marketing. We both have business development skills and a high work ethic/drive. So in that sense we have our bases covered. I have been to Vietnam a few times and I have fallen in love with Hanoi. It feels as f the universe is pulling us here. Europe is going down the drain (I currently live in Sweden) and the US is in an even worse spot. I used to live in New York and LA and I never want to return. Thats our background. 
 Idea. Import/Export/Manufacturing either textiles or beauty. Thats the plan at least. I don&#x27;t think I have enough funds to venture …</span>

Is it rainy season in all of Vietnam or less in one area? I am from Florida so this I’m pretty used to. Is it raining all day or is it an hour then done for the day like here? Also is there any other areas to visit while in those bigger cities?

I know every flood is different, but from your experience with these floods, are my travel plans likely to be ok, ie are the roads, airports etc likely to clear by then?

                              <span>🇬🇧 EN Hi all, 
 As the title says, can I have some travel advice by someone in Da Nang or who has travelled in Da Nang today (since the Level 4 Disaster flood warning was issued today [for the first time in history apparently.]).
 We have a train into Da Nang tomorrow and a flight out of Da Nang two days after.
 We are wondering whether we need to make changes to our plans, or whether taking the risk to go is an okay decision.
 🇻🇳 VN Chào mọi người 
 Như tiêu đề đã nói, tôi có thể có một số lời khuyên du lịch của một người nào đó ở Đà Nẵng hoặc người đã đi du lịch ở Đà Nẵng ngày hôm nay (kể từ khi cảnh báo lũ lụt thiên tai cấp 4 được ban hành hôm nay [rõ ràng là lần đầu tiên trong lịch sử.]). 
 Chúng tôi có một chuyến tàu đến Đà Nẵng vào ngày mai và một chuyến bay ra khỏi Đà Nẵng hai ngày sau đó. 
 Chúng tôi đang tự hỏi liệu chúng tôi có cần thay đổi kế hoạch của mình hay không, hoặc liệu chấp nhận rủi ro để đi là một quyết định ổn. 
 ———
 EDIT: We’ve called some sources who state that the train station is less affected than the airport. Would anyone be able to validate this?
 EDIT: Chúng tôi đã gọi cho một số nguồn nói rằng nhà ga xe lửa ít bị ảnh hưởng hơn sân bay. Có ai có thể xác nhận điều này không?

                              <span>Hi there!
 My partner, toddler and I have so far spent time in Hanoi, Ninh Binh and Ha Long Bay. What an incredible country, we are having such a great time. We came knowing that it was the wet season but the day we got to Hue my partner came down with some sort of tummy bug... 
 We&#x27;re taking it easy for a couple of days and keeping the kiddo as entertained as possible but I&#x27;m now feeling a little concerned regarding our plans to travel to Da Nang on the 15th. 
 We are getting the train in and our hotel is very close to the beach in the center most part. 
 Judging from the news stories of flooding I can&#x27;t see how us turning up will be a good thing for ourselves, and the already struggling local services. 
 From a travel weary father of a toddler and partner of a sick girlfriend, please may I have some advice on how to proceed? 
 Our flight leaves from Ho Chi Minh on the evening of the 19th and we have a connecting flight from Da Nang that morning. 
 Many thanks

                              <span>Why are massage parlours/nail salons etc requesting for 5-star reviews in exchange for 10% or so discount on the bill at the end? I felt so pressured to rate it with the owner hovering over me and making sure I submit a review right in front of her. How odd. How can we trust which places are genuinely good with all these incentivised reviews?

 Da Nang, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh. These are the available routes for the airline with which I would fly. 
 Thank you very much!

 We live in HCMC, very close to the airport. My daughter (17), is studying online and she&#x27;s lonely 🙁 She has joined a gym but she&#x27;s wanting friends.
 Can anyone recommend any social groups or activities that she could join?

                              <span>Hey guys 
 Before I came to Vietnam I heard a lot of people saying that people from Hanoi are unfriendly especially compared to the south.
 Now I’ve been in Vietnam for 2 years I’m living in Saigon but frequently go to Hanoi.
 Before I went to Hanoi the first time I was kinda worried that people are not as nice. But quite the contrary was the case.
 I had lots of great experiences in Hanoi and people were generally friendly.
 I often heard that people there are not smiling but I didn’t see that at all. When people see me they show me a peace sign ✌️ or wave and invite me for a cigarette or the tobacco bong or this self made alcohol ( I think it’s ginseng but idk for sure ) 
 Generally I found people very open towards me,maybe those bad experiences people talk about only happen in the city center?
 What I also find interesting is that people talk to me in full blown Vietnamese which I find refreshing. They don’t dumb down or change to English, they just talk and try to make me understand with sign language lol 😂.
 Everytime I’m in Hanoi I feel like my Vietnamese improves a lot.
 Anyways just wanted to share my experience in Hanoi.

                              <span>We booked a Vietnam Airline flight via Vexere App. Payment went through, and we received a booking code in the app. From booking train tickets with this app I was used to receiving an additional mail from the actual transport company,e.g. Vietnamese Railway etc. When this did not happen, I tried to look up our booked flight on the airline website using the booking code and last name. But no booking data could be found. Hotlines could not be reached today. Did anybody have the same problem and could maybe give an advice?

                              <span>Have you ever seen Anyone that got naturalised and got a Vietnamese passport through marriage? 
 I know that it’s technical possible from the law but I’ve never seen anyone that actually went through the process and achieved it.
 Is that just something that exist on paper but is not really done in real life?

 \&quot;I hope napalm stuck to your children\&quot;???
 &quot;Man upset that he has to pay 10.000vnd (the equivalent of $0.4) for parking, proceeds to say a bunch of vile things to a Vietnamese parking attendant.” His youtube channel, vlogging a Dead Horse, shows he’s still in VN, likely Ninh Binh. &quot; I read it on IG vietnamlocaladventures , and after watching this video, I was really angry at those horrible words. If this is a joke, he&#x27;s still a horrible person. No one jokes like that, it&#x27;s an insult to the guard and his family.
 In the video posted earlier, he drank beer then drove his motorbike here. That also basically violates traffic laws.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m planning to travel in Vietnam during January while working remotely. 
 I&#x27;m planning to do major cities, Hanoi, Halong bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An, Dalat, HCMC. Originally I was planning to start north and go all the way down to the south and fly out of HCMC. 
 But now I&#x27;m having doubts that this is the best route, weather wise and public transportation wise is it better to start south and make my way to the north or vice versa? 
 Any other tips welcomed :) 
 Thanks

 I don’t mind them upon sunrise when they’re doing their thing but in the middle of the day on repeat for a few hours…what the hell is wrong with these creatures?! My neighbor has one and it goes wild at all times of the day!!
 Somebody fill me in…
 Is it because so many locals keep them in tiny cages and they just want to roam with the ladies? 
 I’m used to Roosters btw but some of these ones can be a total annoyance sometimes…

To be fair, I am though at 31 😂 . This lady was doing my hair and she was 50 and I called her cô. She corrected me to call her chi so I started addressing people as anh/chi/em even if they’re much older. I look much younger though so people change how they address me once I tell them my age. I remember receiving lì xì and now I’m giving lì xì. Time flies, già rồi 🥲 
 PS - I’m viet kieu so there are a lot of nuances I’m still trying to understand

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t ask this question on r/HistoryWhatIf or any alternate history channel because most of them have no idea of European history. 
 Vietnam is a nation that is well-known for being extremely good at fighting wars, managing to gain independence from a strong nation like China, defeating the Mongols, and expanding down from the Red River Delta to the Mekong Delta, destroying Champa and Cambodia in the process. They also defeated the French, Americans, and Chinese forces which threatened their independence in the 20th century and managed to overthrow the Khmer Rouge which were battle-hardened troops, or so many internet historians say. 
 However, during the 18th-19th centuries, there were many wars the Vietnamese had against the Siamese over the control of Laos and Cambodia. While both sides had their victories and losses, the Vietnamese won more conflicts than the Siamese, which is weird since Laos was controlled by the Siamese while Cambodia was jointly-controlled, meaning that the Siamese gained more land in the war. 
 In 1800, Siam had a population of 4 million while Vietnam had a population of 7 million, almost 2 times more. 
 Without European colonialism, would Vietnam had conquered Siam like how they conquered Champa and the Mekong Delta? Or was Siam too strong of a kingdom to conquer? 
 Many Thais don&#x27;t know much about the Siamese-Vietnamese wars since it is skipped over in history classes. As I&#x27;m not a Vietnamese, I don&#x27;t know whether these wars are taught much in Vietnamese schools but I&#x27;m sure Vietnamese people are more knowledgable in their histories than Thais are in theirs. So I decided to ask the question here.

                              <span>I understand that most of the tourists coming to Vietnam, or SE Asia in general, just hop on a moped with little to no experience. Everyone tells me the same thing to just &quot;find a quiet road, fuck around for 30 minutes and you&#x27;ll be fine&quot;, but also these are the same people that end up hurting themselves or worse - someone else. 
 I don&#x27;t want a lecture on being a dumb foreigner causing accidents on mopeds because we don&#x27;t know how to ride them properly, I&#x27;m genuinely trying to ask what is a relatively ethical and normal way to learn to ride a moped here? How do you go from no prior experience to taking on the sea of bikes in the big city?
 Currently staying in Hanoi and feel a bit limited to using Grab to get everywhere, especially for the future when I would like to travel to more rural regions that don&#x27;t have the same accessibility without a bike. I obviously don&#x27;t want to learn in the traffic here but what would be a good place to go and &quot;fuck around&quot; without anyone going about? 
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I have been avoiding ice for 2 weeks while here, but eventually decided to drink a coffee at this chain of coffeeshops. I thought being a corporation they must be using ice not made out of tap water but I was wrong!
 Before this coffee I hadn&#x27;t had any issues while eating at food stalls everyday.

                              <span>So, I had a conversation with a Russian-Vietnamese (who was born in Russia). She was not okay with Vietnam staying neutral in the Ukraine - Russia war. While I really don&#x27;t appreciate her point of view, I can see why. After all, she is Russian and she wants people to support Russia. I also have seen the opposite story, where pro-West Vietnamese condemn Vietnam for staying neutral.
 The conversation, unpleasant as it was, was quite interesting. Which do diaspora Vietnamese community care more about, the interests of their native country or the interests of Vietnam ?
 For example, let&#x27;s say if Taiwan and China went to war, would you expect Vietnam to do something about it for the interest of Taiwan / China because you live in Taiwan / China ? Cause I really don&#x27;t see the point of Vietnam picking a side.
 Whenever you vote for your leader in your country, do you pick them for the interests of Vietnam ? When Trump got elected, my friends studying in US were absolutely terrified, because they were afraid of him imposing strict laws on immigrants, and that was not a good thing for Vietnamese who tried to work and study over there.

                              <span>Really strange, I needed a bit more than the normal cabin bag limit (I have a lot of electronics) and I looked in the booking phase and have a screen shot of them saying there is two pieces of luggage for business classic. But my ticket has been issued and it says 1 piece of luggage! This is totally weird for business class. (I am fine with the 32kg limit of checked baggage but I have two bags a 16kg and an 8kg bag.
 I have tried the US help line and it is just going to voice mail (even though it is within US hours.) is this normal? Any advice here?

 Can anyone find the Vietnamese version of this song? It must be really old and I don&#x27;t speak enough Vietnamese to know the lyrics. If this helps, I&#x27;m 100% sure they say heart &quot;trái tim&quot; in the Viet version. Probably made around 2010.

                              <span>If so, why?
 There is too many upsides to getting a Vietnamese passport, and NOT enough downsides.
 - The visa situation will get more stringent over time. Look at what happened post-COVID. One day, you will NOT be allowed to do infinite border runs, even on your 5-year visa exemption. Pre-COVID, it was VERY easy to renew your tourist visa inside the country. Post-COVID, much harder. Look at Thailand ... they charge $24K USD for their 5-year tourist visa (&quot;Thai elite visa&quot;)
 - Vietnam&#x27;s GDP rising.
 - Opening a business is easier. You don&#x27;t need a Vietnamese partner who owns 51% share of the company
 My prediction is, it will only get HARDER &amp; harder to get a Vietnamese passport as Vietnam&#x27;s GDP rises ... just look at Vietnam&#x27;s visa policy -- it&#x27;s already hard for non-ASEAN tourists to get a visa.

                              <span>Apparently, Vietnamese pronouns are really hard for many learners, so I decided to make that one of the first things I&#x27;d tackle in the language. Correct me if my explanation is wrong.
 Vietnamese has a few pronouns, of course. The pronoun for I is fairly common, for instance. However, it seems like Vietnamese likes to avoid using true first and second person pronouns, like other Asian languages. However, that means you need some other way to distinguish yourself and different people in conversations.
 Vietnamese chooses age and gender. You imagine that this person is a part of your family and choose a pronoun for you and a pronoun for them that agrees. For example, I would call myself big brother if I&#x27;m talking to a little girl and call her little sibling, and she would do that in reverse.
 Here&#x27;s a chart I made with all the different pronouns: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1WGMQL-_9XU14HV8i4OgvW0fiPY50n4OUcoNOS0q8U/edit?usp&#x3D;sharing
 I honestly think it&#x27;s a fascinating system. You get to show respect for the listener in more ways than tu/vous in French, but you also don&#x27;t have to change the entire sentence, like you would in Korean.

                              <span>I moved to a very multicultural city in a Western country and I&#x27;m in the process of finding a room to rent. I went check out this house this week and was shown around by this friendly vietnamese woman around my age in her 30s. There was a guy renovating the house who was also super friendly and chatty. I soon realized they were probably together despite the fact it was odd as he could pass as her dad. He&#x27;s a local, not an immigrant. She has a kid too.
 So days go by when I haven&#x27;t made up my mind so I send her a message asking if said room is still up for grabs. She says it&#x27;s been taken. But then proceeds to send me a message saying One thing I want to say to you is you are really handsome and have such a beautiful smile. This followed by a cheerful/smiley emoji.
 Well, what the heck?
 Isn&#x27;t this at best inappropriate considering she&#x27;s likely with this other guy? Am I missing a cultural difference?

                              <span>Hi, I went to the S-21 Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum today, in Cambodia. On the third floor, of I think building C or D, there was a piece of information that said.
 There was a person who in 1975 he was the director of the Vietnam war remnants museum. Like either he was the director, or some other high position. And then because of his expertise, he was chosen to be the director of the S-21 museum in the 1980s. 
 Does anyone know who this person was? I didnt take a picture of that blurb. But I remember it clearly

 I will soon be travelling to Vietnam, landing in Ho Chi Minh.
 As soon as I arrive I will need to get myself a Vietnamese SIM card and exchange some money. Is the airport the best place to do this or shall I wait and do it in town?
 Thanks for your help.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m travelling with my Cambodian family (group of 11) from Australia to Vietnam. We&#x27;ll be in HCM for 3 days, then moving onto Cambodia for the rest of our month long trip. My 80 yr old dad has been stockpiling loads of paracetamol (we&#x27;re talking at least 20 boxes / 100 tablets per box) to give to the extended fams... Will this be allowed if split between everyone? TIA

                              <span>Hello, I have a friend who is a foreigner and has lived in Vietnam for 4 years.
 He had a business visa before for teaching English in Vietnam for 1 year but quit the job and now working remotely for a foreign company. So he is living on an investor TRC &amp; visa. 4 years ago, he had to renew his tourist visa once or twice by leaving Vietnam to Cambodia then entering Vietnam again.
 He now has trouble entering Vietnam as his entry date was on the old expired passport and he is holding his new passport. So at the Cambodia - Vietnam border, they didn&#x27;t issue him the new visa for Vietnam. He went home, brought his old passport over and still they didn&#x27;t issue him the visa because they couldn&#x27;t find the stamp for his TRC on his passport. (what does this mean please help me explain this)
 He has to go to the HCM Immigration office for help. Now I have some questions:
 - Can a foreigner live in VN forever with just tourist visa? How many time can one leave and enter Vietnam on tourist visa? Can he do this for the rest of his life?
 - Can someone work remotely for a foreign country but want to live in Vietnam? What kind of paperwork he needs to be able to get a residence permit here?
 - How long an investor TRC last? Can one keep using his investor visa/TRC for multiple entries in Vietnam?
 - Can someone be a criminal (maybe not wanted) in their country or other country and can enter Vietnam without being recognized?
 - Can one commit a crime in the past and be able to apply for a job in Vietnam?
 - What kind of job can grant one a work permit? Does it have to be a full-time job?
 Is there any other possibility around this case where one won&#x27;t be able to find a job in Vietnam, or not plan to but want to live in Vietnam? Is there any issue could hold one back from getting a job in Vietnam?

Đà Nẵng có phải là một nơi thân thiện và giá cả phải chăng để sống không? Thu nhập từ các khoản đầu tư của mình mỗi tháng là khoảng $30 triệu một tháng mà không cần làm việc.
 Hẹn hò ở Việt Nam thế nào, đặc biệt là cho những người Việt Mỹ có phong cách sống phương Tây hơn?

                              <span>My business is doing really well and I am expected to come into a significant payout. I am a Vietnamese-Aussie who doesn&#x27;t have a family. 
 My question is what business would you start if you have enough funds and your in-depth knowledge of the Vietnamese market. 
 I&#x27;m not fishing for answers only, I want to start a discussion on Vietnam&#x27;s economy and her next stages and how Viet Kieu or even just general foreign investment can help accelerate that process. 
 Examining the market it&#x27;s saturated with restaurants and cafes at all levels. I was initially looking into starting a steak restaurant at the 3-4 star range because of my contacts in my home country. But it seems so risky to try and capture that market. A lot of cost into renovations etc. 
 I really want to bring money back into the country in an beneficial way for myself too don&#x27;t get me wrong. I guess maybe people more knowledgeable than I can answer, thanks.

                              <span>I have a relative and they said that they learned Pascal when they were in their 8th grade computer science class, which was about 10 years ago. Coming from the US, it&#x27;s pretty unheard of anyone learning Pascal, especially in a middle school or high school setting. I&#x27;d imagine Java or Python would be more standard. I can probably guess that computer science education is not as advanced or well funded in other countries, so that is maybe the reason for using an older language.
 Also I came across this old post, not sure if it is still relevant or not

                              <span>Hi all, I’m traveling to Vietnam for 5 weeks at the beginning of November. I am unsure of what to do for payment. I have a Wells Fargo Visa debit card and CitiBank MasterCard credit card; I am from the USA. I know most tourists pay in cash in Vietnam, but I am worried that my debit card won’t work at ATMs to withdraw cash. Unfortunately, I probably don’t have time to open a new debit card. 
 In addition, I am not sure of how to book through apps like Booking.com, Hostelworld, Grab, 12go, etc. Grab doesn’t seem to accept my USA visa debit card. I have been able to book a couple hostels with my US card but unsure if it will work once I land in Vietnam. 
 I predict I will spend $1-1.2k USD, but obviously don’t want to just carry that much cash to be converted to VND all at once. Maybe I will take $200 cash.
 Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!

I booked an AirBnB in HCMC in district 1. My fiance is really worried about hidden cameras in our rented space. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it when she first said, but she keeps mentioning it again and again.... like borderline paranoid about it. Is it something I should worry about? Where are some places to check just to ease her worries when I arrive there? Thanks!

I have read some of the past threads about internet being an issue and was looking for some advice on how to make sure I have a stable internet connection for an hour zoom call with the US. 
 How I am staying at a 3 star local hotel, will the internet be reliable there? 
 Will a local SIM be better? 
 Are there any Internet cafe/we work type services that have a private room that I might be able to book for a couple hours in the middle of the night?

                              <span>My partner and I will be traveling Vietnam next month (November 12th to 26th) for 15 days. I am thinking of exploring Hanoi, areas in the North, and not going any further south than perhaps Hoi An. We don’t want to rush too much so would prefer to stick to 3 to 4 places. I have some questions that I would appreciate some help with:
  
Ha Giang: We would really love to do the loop on our own but are not experienced on motorbikes so can’t really make that happen. We aren’t into guided tours so wondering if there is an alternative way to enjoy Ha Giang without doing the loop. Trekking perhaps? We are experienced overnight trekkers and like big days such as 10-15 miles per day hiking. Is trekking a good alternative to motorbiking the loop in Ha Giang? If so, can we do this on our own or would we need a trekking guide? To add, we aren’t against hiring a private guide for certain things, especially if it allows us to learn more about the area, just aren’t into big group tours.
 Ninh Binh or Mai Chau: My partner gets sick on boats and we also don’t really like overrun places so considering skipping Ha Long Bay. Would you perhaps recommend Ninh Binh or Mai Chau as an alternative for a few days? If you could only go to one, which would it be?
 Phong Nha Ke Bang: I would really like to go here but I know November is the rainy season there. Is it still worth trying to go? Can you do trekking or some of the caves without a guide or are guides required? I was planning on not going further south than Hoi An but should we perhaps try to skip some of central Vietnam and try to see somewhere drier such as Dalat?
 These are the places I would like to see but won’t have time for everything. What would you recommend removing/adding? We enjoy physical activities such as trekking, cycling, nature, sleepy towns, good food, the ability to explore by bike.
 
  
Hanoi

 Thanks so much in advance!

                              <span>Anglish is a thought experiment about what English would sound like if it had no loanwords from Latin, Greek, French, etc. Some examples are Uncleftish Beholding (&quot;Atomic Theory&quot; - all the scientific words which are borrowings from Latin/Greek are directly translated into English), and the Anglish Moot (an Anglish Wikipedia, basically).
 I&#x27;m intrigued (as a Vietnamese person) what Vietnamese would look like if we were to do something similar - no Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary, no French and English loanwords. Expressing scientific/modern concepts (and many everyday concepts as well - such as time; &quot;thời gian/时间&quot;) without Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary would be very challenging, IMO - probably because Chinese has been influencing Vietnamese longer ago, and for a longer time, than Latin/Greek/French/Old Norse have been influencing English.
 From &quot;Uncleftish Beholding&quot;, which calls an electron a &quot;bernstonebit&quot; (a calque of &quot;electron&quot;, which comes from the Greek for &quot;amber&quot;, &quot;amber&quot; being a loanword from Arabic by way of Old French), perhaps an electron could be &quot;chớp con&quot; (a calque of Chinese 电子; Sino-Vietnamese reading điện tử). Maybe a computer could be &quot;óc chớp&quot; (calque of Chinese 电脑). (Tính - all senses - is a Sino-Vietnamese word)
 Just to clarify: this is only a thought experiment by someone interested in languages.

                              <span>Tôi là nam.Năm nay 16 tuổi đang học trong 1 trường công. Gia đình tôi cũng không thuộc khá giả lắm, cũng coi là có của ăn của để. Nma hiện giờ gia đình tôi không ổn lắm, đang trên bờ vực li dị. Vì bố tôi hay đi uống, nhậu nhẹt về có lời lẽ quá đáng và xô xát với mẹ tôi.mẹ tôi không thích điều này nên hay cãi và lớn tiếng mỉa mai. Tất cả nguyên nhân của cuộc cãi vã là mẹ tôi cho &quot;bạn &quot; mượn 70 triệu không qua giấy tờ từ 8 năm trước đến bây giờ vẫn không trả đồng nào trong khi gia đình tôi hiện đang khó khăn vì chị tôi vừa lên đại học và cần nhiều thứ để chi. Và mẹ tôi còn mượn họ hàng tiền có kèm lãi, vòng tròn thiếu tiền &#x3D;&gt;mượn nợ&#x3D;&gt;trã tiền+lãi&#x3D;&gt; thiếu tiền xoay vòng liên tục khiến nhà tôi khó khăn hơn. Bố tôi cực kì bất mãn về việc này nên khi say hay dùng việc này để sỉ vã mẹ tôi. Khiến mẹ tôi không chịu nổi và muốn li dị, hiện tại đã viết giấy và chỉ cần ký và nộp toà là gia đình tôi đổ bể. Tôi đang đứng trước vấn đề muôn thuở của đề tài này &quot; con chọn theo ai?&quot; Thật sự thì tôi chả muốn họ li dị hay chọn theo ai cả, giờ tôi chả biết làm thế nào. Xin mọi người cho tôi một lời khuyên

 Been to various locations around Vietnam and the world, but I have never experienced such a high concentration of rudeness, in-politeness and general unprofessional behaviour than I have in Da Lat, second to Paris, of course.
 I&#x27;ve read many people here complain about the behaviour of locals (yet choose to stay), in my experience barely 1 in 50 interactions have been negative. Yet, in Da Lat, this was flipped where barely 1 in 5 interactions were pleasant. This included drivers at Langbiang (a massive tourist trap, but anyway) literally running to their Jeeps and quickly driving away when asked for assistance, attendants being more pushy to payment than I&#x27;ve experienced elsewhere, rude staff, attendants etc., incredibly dangerous and aggressive motorcycle drivers, and shop attendants promising to help with postal/online orders than ignoring messages or giving one word replies to detailed questions (messaged in vietnamese) when followed up with. Along with your usual long stares from locals, attempted rots at tourist traps etc.
 Before people jump the gun with &quot;what do you expect in Vietnam/tourist place/being a forigner etc.&quot; I&#x27;m used to people in cities with lots of tourism being rude or just tired of the people who&#x27;s income they rely on (Paris and Kyoto are notable examples), but what I experienced here was far beyond anything I have in other parts of Vietnam such as Da Nang, Hanoi or even HCMC.
 Is this something locals and other travellers have found? Do Da Lat people have a reputation for their attitude in Vietnam or did I just have several one-off experiences?
 Oh, sorry I forgot to start the post with &quot;I love Vietnam, its people, its culture etc. but....&quot;, its implied

                              <span>Vietnamese source here, and you can pretty much find the latest info about this greedy coach everywhere recently.
 A quick brief for those who don&#x27;t know Vietnamese:
  
Vietnamese young athletes of the national table tennis team informed the public about how bad their daily meals were, and a big investigation was carried out 
 apparently they were supposed to have a 8-person dinner which cost was around 800,000vnđ (~32 US dollar), but none of the provided images about the meal proved such thing (fried tofus, boiled veggies, etc), and apparently all of them was being heavily under-fed 
 things turned out that a huge part of their provided money from the sport department was kept by the coaches
  
Latest news shows that the head coach explains that he&#x27;s just keeping the money because some athletes have been scammed before by online deals, therefore he would be keeping all the money and return it to them at the end of the year.
 These greedy men are now fired.

                              <span>When the Israeli (guest)s rose to leave, Giap suddenly turned to the Palestinian issue. “Listen,” he said, “the Palestinians are always coming here and saying to me, ‘You expelled the French and the Americans. How do we expel the Jews?’” 
 The generals were intrigued. “And what do you tell them?” 
 “I tell them,” Giap replied, “that the French went back to France and the Americans to America. But the Jews have nowhere to go. You will not expel them.”

                              <span>Whats up with the Chinese tourists here being so rude. Constantly pushing in lines, being rude to tour guides, at one point I saw a Chinese man tap snatch a pair of tongs a girls was using to pour food, poured for himself, and then gave them back. Definitely don’t think all of them are, just seen it happen so much in the 8 days i’ve been here. It’s almost as if the they believe that everyone is here to serve them. Chinese people I’ve met in Australia are generally well mannered, so completely baffled to why they are like this here.

                              <span>It used to be the sound of him beating his kids and grandkids, I think they all left over the years, or they’re locked in the house, and he started to keep dogs. They’re tied up in the same spot 24/7/365. Theres 3 in the pic, two tied up and one in a tiny cage, it can’t even barely move around in. I don’t see the point of keeping pets just to keep them as prisoners.
 Never had a walk, they bark constantly, more if you go anywhere near them. They must be suffering constantly. In developed countries there’s agencies that stop this disgusting behaviour..
 Do you think people in Vietnam will ever change their attitude to the treatment of animals?

                              <span>My grandmother (78yo born in the South) just explained the term “Bắc kỳ” to me, which I had never heard before... Is Bắc kỳ still considered a derogatory term these days? Or is it irrelevant to anyone other than Southerners around her age who were fucked over by the Viet Mình?
 She’s got me scratching my head over here, curious to hear anyone’s thoughts ¯_(ツ)_/¯

                              <span>I am flying with Vietjet Airlines from Mumbai to Hanoi, and my bag measures 62 x 32 x 24 cm, which exceeds the specified dimensions of 56 x 36 x 23 cm on the Vietjet website. Although I&#x27;ve purchased a 2kg add-on for weight, I&#x27;m uncertain if they will also check my bag&#x27;s dimensions.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning my first international trip in January and I want to take Jan 1-16 to see the world solo.
 I was contemplating between Vietnam + Thailand or Vietnam + Taiwan (Thailand would be more conveniently distanced, but I think Taiwan is more interesting). 
 Not sure if it matters but I plan on spending 3 weeks in China come May. 
 What do you think?

                              <span>How common is it for single vietnamese women to have a curfew from their family? Recently started dating a woman in her 30s that lives with her family in hcmc and she has a 10 pm curfew. As an American this baffles and frustrates me.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always book through a tour guide but this time I wanted to book myself since I&#x27;m seem to be a lot cheaper. We&#x27;re planning to go to Hanoi, Halong Bay (Cruise) and Ninh Binh and had a few questions for people who have booked these trips themselves before.
  
Is it easy to book a transfer through the hotel? We would need a transfer from Hanoi to Halong Bay and then from there to Ninh Binh.
 What area should I stay in Ninh Binh?
 For tours do all hotels in Ninh Binh offer tours that you can book day of?
  
Thanks!

                              <span>Just got into Ha Long (Bai Chay beach) last night. We are staying at a fairly nice hotel right off the beach in an area that is roughly six blocks squared. The area consists of only hotels, probably 60-80 establishments, of which only about 12 are open and active. Almost every other building, which is multi-stories and beautifully modern, is empty and dark with nothing inside the lobbies. There are maybe 3 cafes that might be open, and maybe 3 restaurants that offer 2-3 dishes each. 
 There is literally NOBODY here. In the 48 hours we have been here, we have counted about 15 other tourists on both the beach and the hotel area. Aside from that, it is completely deserted. The wide streets have almost no traffic, with a car or two (mostly taxis) going past every 15 minutes or so. 
 The closest place to buy beer/snacks/smokes is over a mile away. The beach itself had 2 other people on it until about 3 pm this afternoon. Everything is closed until about 4 when 1 place on the beach opened to sell beer and snacks. 
 So what gives? We understand that it is off season right now and most tourists come November- March. But this place is completely deserted. It’s almost dystopian. We have been to other places throughout south east Asia during off season and nothing compares to how completely deserted this place is. Does anyone know what is going on?

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering moving to Vietnam in the future and like the looks of some of the Vinhome developments - I know they&#x27;re a little faceless but they look modern and clean. Does anyone have experience of living in one of them?
 I know a lot of apartment blocks in Vietnam have poor construction quality and whilst look nice are often plagued with issues such as sewage leaks etc. - how about Vinhomes though?

                              <span>Since everyone keeps arguing about which government is better, I suggest putting everyone on an island ( could be Phu Quoc island ) and placing weapons, food, supplies on the island. Everyone will have 10 days to settle their debate by battling to the death. The last surviving team will receive a medal.
 The fight will be advertised and broadcasted around the world which makes great profit and can help boost the economy
 I&#x27;m open to further improvement for this plan

                              <span>Sorry if this question offended anyone, but I&#x27;m just genuinely curious. I can&#x27;t understand why so many Vietnamese want to move to the US.
 I used to live in district 1, HCMC and there&#x27;s insanely long line of people waiting at the US embassy basically everyday
 Basically all of the older people I know, and quite a few young people really like the US and want to move there.
 It&#x27;s really far away, which makes flying back to visit family a huge pain. Things are also really expensive and it&#x27;s getting rapidly worse. Immigration policy is strict, and it&#x27;s even harder to get the green card to stay there.
 Not to mention the US has a lot of problems too. Just gonna mention 1: racism. I have heard a lot of stories about racism against Asian people in the US.
 I do think the US has quite a few things better than Vietnam, but if you can afford moving to the US then you can definitely afford moving to countless of other, much better countries. Even if just the English speaking ones, there are a few.
 My brother was obsessed with the US, moved there 8 years ago, worked really hard but still don&#x27;t have green card. He is now starting to hate it and want to move to another country instead.
 My personal experience. I moved to the US and lived there for 1 year. I hated every second of it, my time there was horrible, and I was really depressed, even contemplated suicide a few times during my time there. Then I went back to Vietnam and my mood improved dramatically. After staying at home for a while I moved to Japan. Still living in Japan right now, and much happier than I ever was in the US.
 So what do you think? Please share your thoughts.
 Edit: The point of this post is not saying that Vietnam is better than living in the US. The point is why do Vietnamese people only care about and want to move to the US, while ignoring pretty much all other countries. Because if they can afford moving to the US, they can afford moving to those other countries

 Curious if any NBA fan out there knows a good spot/sports bar to catch some games? I&#x27;ll be in Saigon for a few weeks in Feb/Mar next year. Most games should be around 7/8am in Vietnam so I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;s too early for a lot of these places. TYIA

                              <span>Hello,
 Do you know of any service who would offer a tour as pillion rider/easy rider to do the Hai Van Pass as a round trip starting from da nang to hue and back. 
 Is it possible to do such route in 1 day?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be going on the Ha Giang Loop in December! Although I have not planned which agency or hostel I will be doing it with, I will definitely do it when I visit Vietnam in December!
 My question is, as amazing as it looks. There is one death road which does get me quite nervous. Its usually on day 2/3 which is just a narrow road with no gate and your basically at a cliff edge.
 My question is, are there any hostels which allow you to walk up this specific route? It&#x27;s only a couple hundred meters but instead of being on a easy rider I would rather have much peace of mind walking up the route.
 Please let me know and any recommendations you may have! Thanks!

                              <span>So I have been extremely lucky to become friends with a Vietnamese guy I work with. He has my wife and I over for food and karaoke multiple times a year with his whole family. We want to return the favor and have them over our house for dinner. I’m looking for suggestions on what American dishes I should make and which dishes I should stay away from? I’ve thought about trying my hand at some Vietnamese dishes but don’t want to insult them by possibly not making them right or whatever. I was thinking possibly going seafood route? Maybe some kind of seafood boil? Grilled fish? Maybe a pasta with clams? Or possibly smoking some beef ribs? I appreciate any input and suggestions. Thanks.

                              <span>Im traveling to Vietnam next month with my pregnant wife and daughter of 1 y.o. We&#x27;ll be staying in Saigon for 9 days and Phu Quoc for 3 days. Today we got our travel consult and vaccinations for our trip and the doctor said that they do not recommend traveling there in first trimester of her pregnancy, mainly because of the risks regarding the Zika virus. Does anyone know if Zika is still active in Vietnam and if so how many cases are there? And how worried/careful should we be? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>So this is something I’ve wanted to ask for a while. I am from Nepal but grew up in the US. Nepal had a lesser known People’s Revolution in 90s and 2010s. Currently I believe there are 3 major parties; “Maobadi” (far left, militant), Communist Party of Nepal (left), and Congress (center left). However I think a lot of younger Nepali people are starting to lose faith in leftist ideology. I am 24 now, and I feel like more and more I am shifting more towards the left politically, socially, and morally. But since you’ve guys had one of the largest revolutionary movements in history. What do YOU guys feel about it, is what I want to know. To be honest I don’t even know much about the politics of Vietnam and it’s society. So any input is valuable. Hope the mods allow this post.

                              <span>Hi. Viet Kieu looking to get a Vietnamese citizenship, lawyer quoted $7500 USD for doing the paperwork. Is that a rip offf? Does anyone know of any other lawyers in Saigon that can do it for cheaper? Asking for a friend.
 I have heard of other Viet Kieus paying agency to get their citizenship (passport, then CMND) ranging from $300 to $3000 USD.
 Edit: Some people are saying it&#x27;s EASIER to do it while in Canada but why is it? Seems counter-intuitive, wouldn&#x27;t it take longer because they want to see physical papers and that has to be sent from across the pond or no?

                              <span>So for the context, there are too many cases involving food safety and the last case of food poisoning sent more than a hundred people into hospital. I remember the case of pate Minh Chay that caused death was also overlooked and they only fined $755. Why so many cases of food poisoning and they keep doing it? If this is not addressed probably, food poisoning will continue to rise even worse like the Banh Mi Phuong case. What do you think about this?

                              <span>Hello, travelled to Vietnam 5-6 years ago (still my favorite destination ever) and eat Bahn mì multiple times a day! They almost always had an option to add a sort of cream cheese, but i have never seen it since in any Bahn mì outside Vietnam and i cant rly find it when searching for it. Is it a common ingredient and what kind is it exactly ? i suspect that its not traditional, but it was an option and so gooood!

                              <span>Hey everyone, this November, my girlfriend and I are traveling to Vietnam, and we hope to get some travel tips from you for our destinations there. So, if you&#x27;ve been to these places before, please let us know what you liked and didn&#x27;t liked.
 First, we plan to spend a few days in Hanoi and then visit HaLong Bay from there. After that, we&#x27;ll head to SaPa for 1-3 days. Then, we intend to continue our journey to Hoi An and wrap up our trip in Ho-Chi-Minh City. In total, we plan to spend 18 days in Vietnam. Should we change our destinations? Is there anything important we&#x27;re missing? We appreciate every single response!
 Best regards! 🙋‍♂️

 What cities would you&#x27;ll recommend for each city/country/beach and what would be the best route to plan for it as far as which to go to first?

                              <span>For a tropical country with quite a few uses for coconut, the coconut palm/fruit makes surprisingly few appearances in folklore that I am aware of. Sọ Dừa is the only well-known story (to my knowledge) where there is a strongish allusion to coconuts. 
 Are there any origin stories for the coconut in Vietnamese folklore? I know that for example, many Polynesian cultures have stories about a giant eel who is beheaded and the first coconut palm grows from its head, explaining why coconuts look sort of like a face when you dehusk them.
 Or other folktales where coconuts/coconut palms play a significant role.
 Also, I&#x27;ve heard that coconuts with flesh/water that didn&#x27;t develop properly are said to have been &quot;eaten by the moon &quot;(bị trăng ăn). I can&#x27;t find any allusions to any other crops being eaten by the moon. Is there any specific mythology about why the moon eats coconuts?

                              <span>My fiancé and I want to have a wedding in Vietnam. Does anyone have any suggestions on the location? We want to have a week long celebration, more like a party, and get our friends together. I’ve never been to Vietnam so any information would be helpful.

                              <span>I’m not joking. Serious question: do you guys give 70-90% of your income to your wife on monthly basis?
 I lived in Korea and Japan for 6 years and get married with a Korean woman speaking Vietnamese excellently. I often have conversations with Japanese and Korean male co workers and business partners. I swear they rarely do this. 
 Since my wife and I settled down in Hanoi, she has hung out and done yoga with some Vietnamese women in the neighborhood. Then, she went home and dropped hints by telling stories like:
 “Our neighbor A’s husband sends her 90% of his monthly income, so she can manage finance of the family for him, buy what they need and do saving. He only keeps 15 mil for his personal use.”
 I know she will never directly ask me to do that. My wife is typical modern independent Korean woman having good income as professional Vietnamese-Korean translator. I keep my own money and she keeps her own money. We have a common bank account to which both of us send money for family expenses. My annual income &#x3D; 5x her income, so I contribute much more. She is the person who came up with this idea, I totally agreed. She bought 70% of stuffs in our house.
 Yesterday, I saw a video on TikTok. That guy says his salary is automatically sent to his wife bank account by his company, and his wife would give enough amount of money for his living. I viewed the comments to his video, and it seems many people do this. I guess they were joking (not sure), but his video really raised my curiosity to ask this question. I am asking the same question on a Facebook group. Let’s see how many of us actually do this hehe. 
 We are young family (30 husband and 28 wife). We may have the first kid next year, so a solid financial plan is a must.

                              <span>I can’t seem to find a “one way” cruise. 
 Also please critique my plan for cat ba plan. Open to suggestions
 My current plan is:
 November 5 Leave Hanoi for Cat Ba -Take Bus(cat ba express) to Cat Ba, speed boat included 7:45 to 11:30 $14 USD -Check in Hotel -Trung Trang Caves -Hospital Cave? -Hang out around Cat Ba -Rent bikes, scooters to explore island -This seems to be an activity driven island, biking, climbing, etc.
 November 6 Cat Ba
 Serenity Premium Cruise -It&#x27;s more of LAN Ha Bay on the East Side of Cat Ba but they say it&#x27;s more green and less crowded/polluted -This will depart from Cat Ba around 7:30 AM -Ends around 3:15 -$35 USD! -https://halongserenitycruises.com/ details/
 Hang out in Cat Ba for the night
 Latest flight from Haiphong to Da Nang is at 5:55pm. I don&#x27;t think we can get to Haiphong in time to catch that so we have to stay the night.

                              <span>We are looking for something that is all inclusive and offers relaxation. We have never expierenced a vacation together yet. Its been a lot of loss the past few years. From me losing my taste buds from covid after being a chef for 30 years has been hard and harder recently losing my father. (at first i was like maybe this is too much to share then i realize besides my wife i have zero family) im retired who is going to judge. We have been married 8 years. She is my everything, she has had a very hard upbringing through foster care and so much worse. I want to show her what its like to have something specifically made for her and have her pampered like she should of been when she was growing up. So if there is any hidden gems of people to see, places to stay, or heck even realitors to talk to... even sites to go to or person to person talk ideas..... Sincerely, Hoping this helps.....

The base of this soup is some sort of slime, also wondering what that is? It consists of shredded chicken, mushrooms, two quali eggs(?), mushrooms and this slime(?).

                              <span>Price wise Vietjet and AirAsia are comparable whereas Vietnam airline is more expensive.
 I hear vietjet is stingy with AC and prone to long delays. AirAsia flights times aren’t as desirable and they fly into DMK airport instead of BKK (not sure if that’s good or bad). I hear Vietnam airlines is regarded highly but their flights cost more. 
 I’m happy to pay a bit more for a better experience but the flight duration is 2 hours at max so not sure if it makes much difference? 
 Anyone have any strong opinions to share about any of those three airlines?

                              <span>My daughter booked flights home, from Vietnam to the US, then subsequently realized her passport will expire 5 months after she is scheduled to fly out. (The minimum requirement is 6 months.) She hasn’t entered Vietnam yet. Is there a way she can enter where this won’t be an issue? Maybe by bus? Or is there another way to fix this problem?

                              <span>*Thought I’d post in this group since I’m based in Vietnam. 
 Does anyone in the group, particularly experienced ESL teachers, have experience in getting an original textbook/curriculum licensed and published? Is it possible to do it in Vietnam? 
 I have designed a series of IELTS Writing Task 2 textbooks that I’d like to publish (I’d also consider self-publishing, not too familiar with the best method)
 *if it helps to know, I possess a bachelors in English language from a top UK university, a Level IV TESOL and 5 years of IELTS teaching experience. 
 TIA!

                              <span>For those who didn&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a mini truck/tractor-like vehicle used for transporting materials for construction. Folks living in modern city areas might have the privilege of not having to witness or experience this atrocity.
 Man, screw this damned of an ancient, older than dino-fossil, out-dated, dirty vehicle that pumps out zillion tons of harmful smokes, from black to blue in color, to the atmosphere for every meter it goes.
 I live in a suburban area where construction of houses is frequent, and this damned vehicle goes rampant on the street, crossing my house once every 3-5 minutes for hours straight, that&#x27;s how crazy and obnoxious it is. My biggest problem is not its noise, but the amount of godawful enormous smoke emissions it produces.
 Ever travel on a road when you&#x27;re riding a bicycle BEHIND this monster ? Yeah dude, have fun inhaling ALL that smoke this vehicle constantly pumps out of itself all the way until you reach your destination. This thing should absolutely be banned for harmful effects to environment and people alike.
 That&#x27;s it. Thanks for coming to my TEDx talk

It seems like this is a scam or a ripoff at best. Does anyone have firsthand experience going to one of these places? If I go what can I expect? A semi-decent time or is it just something I should absolutely avoid like the plague?

                              <span>Much of the developed world is expected to have an impending population crisis due to very low fertility rates. Although Vietnam&#x27;s fertility rate is below replacement level as well, it is still much higher than that of China/Japan/Korea/Taiwan/HK. There seems to have been a lot of economic growth and potential, but I don&#x27;t know much about geopolitics and economics.

                              <span>Hey Guys, I&#x27;ll be Visiting Vietnam in December, and booked a flight from Bamboo Airways for Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh. When i Booked, The website was set as Vietnam English (Locationa and Language) and I made the transaction in VND through an International Card. But when I&#x27;m checking the same flight through Trip.com or Global USD Mode of the Website, The prices are doubled. Did i just got a sweet deal or made a huge mistake? Will it be a problem if a foreigner has a ticket booked from the Website in VND? Please Help if you have some information regarding this. 
 Chào các bạn, tháng 12 mình sẽ về thăm Việt Nam và đặt vé máy bay Bamboo Airways đi Phú Quốc đi Hồ Chí Minh. Khi tôi đặt chỗ, trang web được đặt là tiếng Việt (Vị trí và ngôn ngữ) và tôi đã thực hiện giao dịch bằng VNĐ thông qua Thẻ quốc tế. Nhưng khi tôi kiểm tra cùng một chuyến bay thông qua Trip.com hoặc Chế độ USD toàn cầu của Trang web, Giá sẽ tăng gấp đôi. Tôi vừa có được một thỏa thuận ngọt ngào hay đã phạm một sai lầm lớn? Sẽ có vấn đề gì nếu người nước ngoài đặt vé từ Trang web bằng VNĐ? Xin hãy giúp đỡ nếu bạn có một số thông tin liên quan đến điều này.

Tôi chả biết là điều này đúng không nhưng tôi ước rằng sẽ được gặp em một lần nữa.

                              <span>Is there any stigma against them here? I know a woman, 28, who has photos of herself with her younger sister. Considering their 19 year age gap though, I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if the younger sister is her daughter. It&#x27;s the way she holds her that makes me consider this. 
 I wonder if she disguises her daughter as a younger sister just to avoid potential stigma.

 Sorry forgot to mention, no pho in the name please. Kinda of played out 🤷‍♂️. Something simple but would represent Vietnam.

                              <span>Looking for a beautiful place in nature to spend a few weeks relaxing. And exploring. 
 I like the sound of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park. Would prefer somewhere that’s calming, friendly locals and good nature to explore by bike. 
 Any specific suggestions for both places, and lodgings, would be really appreciated. 
 Thanks

                              <span>So I’m an American traveling and got here in Da Nang. It’s Saturday night here in Da Nang. I used one of the Sacombank’s ATM and it ate my card. I called the number on the ATM and told my situation. He says I need to call my own bank and get a confirmation letter saying that it’s my card and take that letter to a Sacombank’s branch here on Monday. So I called my own bank (Citibank) and they tell me that they can only provide a Reference Letter with my account number (not the Debit Card number) and it will take a week to get that letter or they can expedite a card and send it by Tuesday. The issue is, I leave here Tuesday morning to Hanoi. That card is my only card for cash and what not. What the hell do I do?

                              <span>I’ll be staying in Vietnam for a few months. I’m curious to find out if there are local communities of tech people who do meet-ups or learning groups. I took a look around “Meetup” app but not much to see there.

                              <span>Went to saigon just to watch HTL vietnamese concert. I just want to see her live and check on the concern scene.
 What I observed : 
 The concert venue looks like an old gymnasium with pipes on the way inside the concert grounds which is unsafe since someone can trip over. 
 But the stage and production value of the concert was superb. The stage has mulple large LED display panel, smoke effects and fire effects. There are orchestra situated in the back of large display panel. There is 3 or 4 different drones on the whole duration of the concert. And multiple cameras all over the place. 
 The songs performed was on her album hoang and link and the encore song is an unreleased song together with the artist in Gieo Que. 
 Most of the audience are singing along with the songs and they coordinatedly changing the color of their light sticks in the color of the LED display. 
 I really enjoyed the arrangement of the songs in the last 5 songs since it has a live rock band feel specially with the drummers performance. 
 About HTL performance though was underwhelming. Her voice feels to me is lipsynced (or maybe overprocessed?). There is no interaction with the audience and feels that it is a performance video and not a concert. I dont know if this a vietnamese thing since most of the concert i gone to has a least interaction to the fans / audience. 
 Overall i enjoyed the concert despite some flaws.

                              <span>Hi. I will be in Hanoi for 9 days next month and I am contemplating if I should go to Da Nang for 2-3 days or just stay in Hanoi all throughout.Is it worth it? Should I take a sleeper train or sleeper bus? Or will that take too much time? Is it better to get Airbnb or a beachside hotel?I initially wanted to go to Sa Pa but I checked the November temperatures in Sa Pa and I don&#x27;t think I can deal with the cold. I am from a tropical country.

                              <span>Just wondering. I mean in the US, we have Marilyn Monroe, and for guys we have something like Tom Cruise. In China, we have Fan BingBing who&#x27;s considered as a beauty goddess and countless male beauty icons. But for Vietnam, I&#x27;m struggling to think of a name
 Who&#x27;s the equivalent of them for Vietnam?

                              <span>My wife and I are having problem in financial management with child care expenses.
 We gave birth our daughter here. We spent a lot of money on her entertainment, health care, education… I hadn’t noticed much until I realized we spent over 50 million vnd on our daughter last month. I think it is quite much for me (i am bread winner). I ask this question to see how people spend money on raising kids in Vietnam and get some insightful suggestions. I need to reduce expenses (around 30-40mil is perfect) but still give our daughter the best things.
 Kindergarten Tuition: 15 mil
 Babysitter: 8 mil
 Child food and supplements: 12 mil 
 Child care product: 2 mil
 Clothes: 2 mil (she’s growing fast)
 Sport and entertainment: 3 mil
 Language education (English and Belarusian): 10 mil. My wife wants the daughter to speak mom’s language well. I can’t say no. I teach her Vietnamese with 0vnd. 
 Edit: please ignore my username, my wife just joked me :))

                              <span>We are going to Vietnam in January and had wanted to go to Sa Pa. I don’t mind the cold but with the fog we might not see anything. We are all over 75 and I read it could be muddy on the trek. My travel guy said not to worry because we can have our guide call a cab if it becomes difficult. Can anyone share their experiences on touring Sa Pa in January?

                              <span>Does anyone know why mussles aren&#x27;t prevelant in vietnamese cuisine? Or if there is a localised are where they are?
 From my understanding and experience, they are eaten in thailand, China, Malaysia etc but seem to be missing in vietnamese cusine. I know they have started to be farmed recently and I assume they must grow as they grow pretty much everywhere. Consequently most places I have had mussels here, even at good places, tend to be overcooked.

                              <span>Just like the title says, it&#x27;s a joke. And not even a funny one. And here&#x27;s my unhinged rant about it.
 Since the implementation of &quot;simulated situations&quot; test, the Vietnamese driving test has stooped to an absolute clusterfuck of bureaucratic mire, created by senile buffoons who I guaran-goddamn-tee you don&#x27;t have the slightest clue what&#x27;s it like to be behind the wheel.
 Here&#x27;s the premise: you&#x27;re given a medley of 10 clips, ranging from 40-50 seconds in length, showing situations that can happen on the road (the majority of them are half-baked 3D scenarios - how realistic). You have to press spacebar when you see a potentially dangerous action. There&#x27;s a set time limit in which you have to mash the button, and you&#x27;ll be graded anywhere from 0-5 depending on when you do it.
 Already this sounds like a horrible idea, knowing that there&#x27;s heavy implication that your intuition can fuck right off and this is strictly a memorize-and-answer kind of test. You can see the sitch and press spacebar ZERO POINT ONE SECOND EARLY and it will be a wrong answer.
 WHO THE FUCK IN THEIR RIGHT MIND THINKS IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO FORCE FEED THIS SORT OF HORSESHIT INTO PEOPLE&#x27;S HEADS AND CALL IT A &quot;TEST&quot;???
 Apparently the Ministry of Traffic and Transports, with their infinite fucking wisdom, alongside whoever ratify the change, do.
 And the tragedy is, it&#x27;s unlikely that this will be revoked, so anyone (including me) who thinks of getting a driver&#x27;s license now can either suck it up or go fuck themselves.

 I&#x27;m imagining it&#x27;s cheaper in Vietnam.

                              <span>My internet sucks. I&#x27;ve called Vietell and they said that once again the undersea cable has broken. It means I can&#x27;t work in the evenings and basically my time becomes a complete waste. Totally fed up with it and in dire need of a solution. Does anyone have one? I&#x27;m sat next to the Wifi on a premium internet package but it&#x27;s no good. Anything that will speed this slow-ass wifi up. please.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to be traveling to Vietnam for 2 weeks with a group of 6 people total. We&#x27;re going to be in Ho Chi Minh City, Can Tho, Can Tao, Hue, and Hanoi. 
 We&#x27;re an English speaking group, looking for local drivers for each of the city for multiple days. 
 There seems to be many to choose from, so we&#x27;re looking for recommendations of people/company you&#x27;ve had great experiences with. The majority of the group are older and enjoys history, bonus if the drivers can provide some insight on local history.
 Thanks!

Unsure if I can deal with, or I&#x27;m being paranoid. Do people live with these kind if problems in Vietnam? - am I being ridiculous to say I need to move out. Just worried it will get worse or atm is dangerous. We&#x27;ve just moved here aswell and planning to stay for 2 years. Any help or advice would be appreciated as I am anxious mess always so I never know if I&#x27;m over thinking...

I have a degree, TEFL, many years of teaching experience. Just don&#x27;t think I will be able to organise all the required paperwork before I leave in 4 weeks. Any advice? Thanks for reading.

I just recently got my Canadian citizenship and passport. If I am to fly back to Vietnam, would that cause an issue? I will be flying in and out of Vietnam with my Vietnamese passport.

 I am originally from Vietnam, have lived in US for years and want to move back to VN. I&#x27;ve been told after 1 year of living in Vietnam I can adopt domestically, but curious to know if anyone has done this?

                              <span>My mom told me the story of the time she first immigrated to america and had a hamburger. It was so bad that she threw up. My grandma ate american food around the same time and got so sick she was hospitalized and now can only eat white rice and meat. Did anyone else or your parents/grandparents experience this? I’m wondering if it’s less common now that american food franchises are popping up in vietnam.

                              <span>I think I can count at least 4 or 5 times (over of being randomly splashed with muddy water between the cracks of sidewalk tile squares. My guess is it’s the tiles that are sitting at an angle? 
 It’s funny but also not so funny sometimes. Considering walking in the road more haha. 
 Anyone else experience this? How many mines have you set off so far?

                              <span>So, I have only been here for 2 days. Call me crazy, but I feel like this is one of the nicest beach cities or beach/city that I have ever been to. I&#x27;ve lived in many places
  
Siargao Island, PH
 La Union Beach, PH
 Baler Beach, PH
 Cebu City, PH
 Bali, ID
 Jogja / Jogja Beaches, ID
 Hua Hin, TH (just 2 months)
  
Philippines used to be my home until I lost my job/home/friends during COVID. It was extremely painful for me and I never found a foot in Indonesia after the borders opened up. Being here in Da Nang is the first time since 3 years ago when I lost my home/everything that I get a sense of home and comfort even though I really can&#x27;t speak the language aside from a few phrases and tones are driving me crazy lol.
 It&#x27;s really nice here in Da Nang. Vietnamese people are kinder than I expected (people here say a lot of negative things about VN people), the beach is much cleaner than I expected as well. I just came from the beach and feel so refreshed. I love this city after just two days. It&#x27;s a wonderful setup that allows you to walk so easily north to south and hop into random coffee shops. I wish I could make this place my home. Although probably unlikely unless I move to HCM for a job but yea, this place is so great.
 The only thing that&#x27;s terrifying AF is how crazy you people drive here LOL!

                              <span>Hello.
 I went to the Dan Sihn market today. Great experience and saw a lot of war memorabilia, but I checked online and one article claimed up to 99% of the stuff was fake and most of the authentic things were bought a long time ago. This seems like an absurd number, so perhaps people here know this better than me; how much of the stuff sold there is real? Would you buy anything there?
 Thanks in advance. Having a great time in this wonderful nation!

                              <span>All my life I was taught to be polite and respectful to older people. But some older people are so rude but then if you say something back you’re hỗn láo bad guy
  
Scenario 1: at Tan Son Nhat, in TSA line, this lady was extremely close to me. Every time I moved up, she inched up directly next to me. So I said “Cô, làm ơn đứng xa xa một chút giùm.” She stopped standing close to me and didn’t say anything but then started whispering about me to her husband saying “Con nhỏ mất dạy.” Like wtf did I do 😭 
 
scenario 2: getting off the plane. I was removing my suitcase from the overhead compartment. You know viet aunties do that nudge thing if they need to get by or they’ll tap you and say move. Well this lady started to shove me aggressively. There was nowhere for me to move since the people in the row above me were in the aisle. The first one, two times I let it go, even the third. Then she kept doing it getting more aggressive each time. This is where I admit I was being really rude back. I turned to her and said “cái gì vậy.” She stopped shoving me and looked at me with full on rage in her eyes like this 😡. Like ma’am, you’re the one shoving me 😭 
 
 I used to always yield to older people but now I’m starting to talk back to them because they can’t demand respect without being polite to others first

                              <span>In fact my baby is still in my body. My husband and I will probably meet him in December.
 Since I moved to Vietnam with my husband, many family relatives, friends of husband, co workers of parents in law have come to visit me and my unborn baby.
 They gave us many things like baby clothes, toys, nutritional food, baby care products,…. The new thing to me is that there is always an envelop of money attached in these gifts. It is often from 1 million to 5 million vnd. The old uncle of my husband even gifted me and baby 1000usd. It is quite strange to me. I feel shy when receiving easy money from people like this. Then, I behaved unnaturally when receiving the gifts from them.
 My husband family even say they may come back after baby is born.
 Why did they do that if they had already gifted us expensive tangible things?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been solo traveling within Japan, even though it&#x27;s not my home country. I work here and have grown fond of exploring its diverse landscapes and culture. Now, with my birthday approaching, I&#x27;m considering a trip to Vietnam. Initially, I was thinking of Hanoi, but a Vietnamese friend suggested Hoi An in central Vietnam.
 Choosing between the two cities is a bit challenging. I usually start with major cities before exploring smaller ones, which leans towards Hanoi. However, the idea of a more relaxed, less touristy experience in Hoi An is appealing.
 I have six days and five nights, factoring in day trips to nearby places and wanting to immerse myself in local life, so I can&#x27;t visit both cities at the same time. I&#x27;m seeking advice from fellow travelers and locals on which city to begin with. I enjoy sketching buildings and nature, and exploring cafes, so finding the right backdrop for these activities is important.

                              <span>This may be a silly question. Is it possible to buy a good bicycle helmet in Hanoi? I&#x27;m assuming it is and there would be plenty of options but the bike tour group we are on asks that we bring them from home. Really don&#x27;t want to carry one around for two weeks before the cycling part of our trip.

                              <span>Just wondering, has anyone bought replica watch from him and his shop before? If so, how good is the quality ? I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s getting all his watches from the same chinese factory that all the other chinese seller are getting from. I&#x27;m heading back to VN in a few months, debating if I should buy from him or other well known rep sellers online. Thanks if you have any info.

                              <span>Im trying to learn vietnamese (i learned french earlier) and feel like so much of it has some french origin. Nearly every “basic” word i learned that has an everyday usage (nha ga, ca phe, va li, sa bong, pho mai) comes from some french word. Are the loanwords mostly found in simple everyday words or also more complex words/phrases (politics, emotions, technical terms, etc) as well?
 If it was possible to make an estimation, approximately how much of the vietnamese language is derived from french?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I just booked my honeymoon in Vietnam for Nov. 24-December 8th. Would love any suggestions on the itinerary below:
 November 24-26th: Hanoi November 27th: Bai Tu Long Cruise (2 day/ 1 night) November 28th: Hanoi (to rest after the cruise &amp; leave for Sa Pa early the next day) November 29th-December 2nd: Sa Pa December 2nd-6th: Hoi An/ An Bang Beach December 7th: last night in Hanoi before we fly out 
 I just had a few questions: 1. Firstly, I read that it’s the very end of the rainy season in Hoi A during early December. Do you think it’s still worth going and risking the rain, or would it be better to choose somewhere else? We want at least one relaxing beach time and also really wanted to see Hoi An. I also read it can be beautiful around Christmas. Is it worth it? Worried about being rained out the whole time but hoping if it’s at the end it might be okay. 2. Is Bai Tu Long bay as beautiful as Halong Bay? Worth it to book Bai Tu Long instead? 3. We’re planning on booking the EcoSapa limousine buses to/from Sapa and Hanoi. Are these a good choice?
 Any other recs/thoughts would be greatly appreciated (especially for a honeymoon vibe)! Thanks so much in advance ❤️

                              <span>This album is a fusion of traditional Vietnamese folk culture with contemporary music styles, incorporating themes and stories inspired by Vietnamese literature. The album showcases accents from all three regions, and it even includes a song reminiscent of &#x27;nhac do.&#x27; I&#x27;ve been listening to it on repeat since YouTube recommended the live showcase to me. What are your thoughts on this?
 I don&#x27;t often listen to Vpop, and I feel like I&#x27;ve been missing out on a lot by only focusing on K-pop for years. Which other artists and their releases do you recommend? I particularly enjoy Truc Nhan and Trung Quan, especially singers who perform well live.

 It came with chicken and veges like onions and tomatoes etc. that you can cook yourself, along with the best &quot;lemony salty&quot; sauce ever (bottom right corner in red bowl). 
 Thank you in advance for any suggestions 😃

                              <span>Are gay spas legal in Vietnam? Last week I went to a gay spa in HCM. I deadass thought it was gay friendly spa with cute masseurs, but nope... all customers were naked and they performed unholy acts in middle of the spa. No masseur and security in sight.
 While in the US this kind of establishment is regulaged by laws, and Paris, Berlin are more laxed with dresscode. But this spa was filled with naked men of all ages flinging their chuối and 2 quả chôm chôm. are these places legal to operate in Vietnam? Any raider by police?

                              <span>Just got off the phone with a relative in Vietnam who is trying to force her 23 year old daughter to move back in with her after she has created a life for herself in Toronto Canada.
 The daughter has become tremendously successful by every metric (has her own e-commerce business, active social life, makes 6 figures) but her mom keeps trying to guilt about how she could die any minute (either from poor health or suicide) and that it’s her “duty” to live with her mom.
 This is the same woman that forced her then 18 year old daughter to sleep in the same bed with her every night to prevent her from masturbating. When I ask my other relatives what they think they actually side with the mom and say the most important thing in life is being near family and this idea of “independence” and “adventure” is pointless and irresponsible. Lol
 Thoughts?

 I&#x27;m planning a trip to Southeast Asia this January and need some advice. I&#x27;ve got an itinerary from Hue to Siem Reap via Da Nang and Hoi An, but I&#x27;ve hit a roadblock trying to find a convenient way to get to Siem Reap from these places. It seems like a direct flight isn&#x27;t an option, and the layovers could take up to 12 hours.
 Could anyone here help me out by suggesting a more efficient route or sharing any local insights? I&#x27;d really appreciate your input!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, I’m single m (31yo) Vietnamese but grew up in Germany. I’m interested in what fixed costs you have monthly. I have heard that in Vietnam what rent and food is very low. For me, for example, the two items already make up 40-45% of my income. (Berlin - top location / 3 rooms / 81qm)
 What else comes up are: Insurance, communication, mobility, loan repayments, etc. In the end, I&#x27;m left with about 10% of my net income per month to save, so not much either. You don&#x27;t get rich that way. How does it look in Vietnam?

I personally like Vietnamese people very much and they have their own unique character which I found very cool. I wanted to know how the Vietnamese community outside Vietnam lives like if they have good or bad experiences or do they live their life in a traditional way or in a Western way. Let me know in the comments!

                              <span>Xin Chao,
 What would a foreigner expect to be paid in Vietnam working in tech?
 I&#x27;m aware there can be a big divide between what companies pay locals vs foreigners (such as pilots). I&#x27;m wondering if this is the same in the tech world, I have a Vietnamese partner and would like to move there at some point - but looking at the job adverts on indeed etc. and the salaries are tiny in comparison to where I am now (UK). Obviously the living cost in Vietnam is equally a lot less than UK but even so getting a nice apartment in Hanoi or Saigon could be comparative to some UK house prices.
 I&#x27;m a network engineer btw.

 Also, what&#x27;s the best seat with a view of Hai Van Pass?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if I saw this correctly, but it appears that in noodleshops (or other small mom and pop viet food shops) there is a bowl or basket of cups. And if you want tea, you take your own cup and fill it up.
 But recently I noticed people use the cup and then place them directly back into the bowl. It doesnt appear as though the shop washed them before the next customer grabbed it and used it.
 And ive noticed this at multiple shops now. Is this a thing in vietnam?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 98-er graduated University since 2020. As you guess it: Covid (2020) - Lockdown (2021) - Economic recession (2022-now). 
 Me and my friends at around the same age have been seriously struggling to find decent jobs since the beginning of 2023. I thought I was lucky to find a job at a tech company with an &quot;ok&quot; salary (1000usd gross). Turned out the company is exploitative and management is extremely toxic and abusive. So back to the grind to find a job for the last couple of months. 
 Why are companies trying to tell us Gen Zs as unstable and indecisive in our careers when in reality, we&#x27;re (or most friends I know) just trying so hard to find a DECENT job where we can stick around for stability without being exploited to the point of mentally suffering to get by?
 Some recruiters even told me that my salary expectation was too high :) My expectation is 20-25M net/month?? Mind you, I have 4 years of experience, fluent at English and graduated from a top university in Aus. I know it largely depends on the job, industries... but it&#x27;s affected my self-esteem somewhat. 
 If you&#x27;re a young native Vnese are you going through the same thing?
 If not, please teach me how to sniff out the bad companies and find ones that pay you you&#x27;re worth?? Open to discuss further
 Edit: I live in HCM, the most expensive city in this country so my expected salary is just enough for me to pay rent, groceries, have very fundamental household needs fulfilled and left with around 2-3mil extra to save. I dont think its too much to ask..

                              <span>I moved to Vietnam this year about six months ago. Almost right on cue, I started to have stomach problems, mainly in the form of diarrhea. Curiously, aside from two particularly awful days, it rarely manifests as outright food poisoning where it affects me the whole day. Rather I&#x27;ll get &quot;you have 30 seconds to comply&quot; situations. Cafe sua especially has a tendency to cause this roughly 1/4 of the time, so I just avoid it now.
 If I cook at home or eat more expensive foreign cuisine like Korean or Japanese food, the problem alleviates and my bowels actually become normal. However, if I go out to eat Vietnamese food (even at busy restaurants with high turnover) or drink cafe coffee (including even some supposedly safe looking coffee shops like Cafe Amazon), it&#x27;s only a matter of time before things rear their ugly head again. Most of the time, I&#x27;ll be fine, but I feel like a bout or two of diarrhea (but not out and out food poisoning, I never throw up or feel nauseous) every two weeks isn&#x27;t normal. It feels like a shame to not feel comfortable eating the local food due to these issues. 
 I have never had these issues before, and the timing from my arrival here (as well as its alleviation when i switch to home cooking only) is quite conspicuous. From what I hear, travelers diarrhea is supposed to resolve within a few weeks, not six months. Has anyone else experienced these issues? Is my stomach just not built for here?

Been back here for two years and still experiencing this culture shock. I do feel like an alien sometimes. Anybody have advice to overcome this culture shock?

                              <span>Recently there was a video of a teacher bullying a student. The reason is because that student didn&#x27;t buy desserts from the bakery the teacher told her to buy. And then later the headmaster of that school wants to punish the student who upload the video. They are trying to cover their wrong doing and warn others not to publish the evidence to save the school&#x27;s face. 
 Vụ này ở VN mấy ngày nay nổi rầm rầm chắc ai cũng biết. Vấn đề là mình cảm thấy những vụ liên quan đến bạo lực học đường, dù là do giáo viên hay học sinh bắt nạt lẫn nhau, đều bị nhà trường hoặc cố giấu nhẹm hoặc là lờ đi không hề nhắc đến, có vụ nữ sinh tự tử do bị bắt nạt quá đà mà nhà trường biết nhưng cố tình ép nữ sinh đi học để bị bắt nạt tiếp, trong khi đó không hề đứng ra xử lý gì việc bắt nạt. 
 Cái này rõ ràng ai sống ở VN đều biết là để giữ điểm thành tích, thanh danh cho nhà trường. 
 Nghĩ ai còn đang đi học với ai có con cái còn đi học sẽ thấy thế nào, hoặc là bị bắt nạt rồi đến mức phải chuyển trường, thành vết sẹo tâm lý, trong khi đó không ai bênh vực cả. Nếu ko có những clip bằng chứng như vậy ai sẽ biết đến vụ việc bị bắt nạt? Mà giờ còn phạt cả những ai dám nói, dám đưa clip lên nữa.
 Các bạn nghĩ sao về vụ này?

 ​
 I would like to see if people have any recommendations with the following information
  
A cruise recommendation that doesn&#x27;t have all families and couples
 Any insight or clear justification for us to choose a cruise from either either Ha Long Bay or Cat Ba

I’m moving to Ho Chi Minh in November (long term) and I’d like some suggestions on cellphone plans and sims that offer either unlimited data or a decent amount of data, as well as calls and texts. I’ve heard about Viettel and Vinaphone but I can’t find the actual process of setting up a sim that isn’t a tourist sim. Any help would be appreciated 🙏 thank you!

                              <span>Hello, I am a foreigner working remote in Vietnam. I have a partial citizenship due to me being Vietnamese. 
 I heard there was opportunities to make some extra side money by helping with student assignments or something along those lines.
 So I was wondering if anyone knew about that or any other possible ways to earn extra money while I’m here.
 Side note: can’t speak Vietnamese , only understand it for the most part. Full English speaking, degree in business and economics. Doing salesforce admin work remotely.

 Planning to explore Vietnam in early December. Will Ninh Binh and Ha Long be good to visit before 10th of December? In terms of the clarity of views and overall weather in general.
 Thanks in advance. :)

                              <span>Here I will answer how to get the vat refund. When you buy any item in Vietnam. Costly items like electronics, phone, camera etx. The shop needs to fill up the customs declaration form. It will mention your passport details. Entry exit date, expiry date etc. You can claim the vat refund only if you are on a tourist visa, exiting the country. At the airport, you need to go to the customs office. At Hanoi airportz it&#x27;s little tricky. The security, police don&#x27;t understand English. I asked 4 people. They could not answer. Information desk could not explain me even after I showed the translator. Eventually I found out the customs office. 
 I presented the customs declaration form to the officer. He took 2-3 minutes to verify it and forwarded to a clerk of MSB bank who was sitting at the next counter. She asked me to sign couple of forms. Then provided me 85% of the total vat. She paid me in cash USD. Entire process took 10 minutes. That&#x27;s all.

                              <span>I just got a new job that requires 1hr commute each way on a motorbike during peak hours, and on terrible roads. I&#x27;m considering buying a new motorbike that is:
  
Comfortable on long ride and bumpy road
 It doesn&#x27;t have to be super fast, but it needs to have good acceleration from dead stop because that would make life easier when I&#x27;m stuck in traffic jam
 Decent storage space because I need to keep a spare helmet + my bag and other stuff
 Is not too short. I was considering Leads but as a 6&#x27;0 guy, my legs are bent too much riding a Leads
 Not too expensive like SH

                              <span>For reference, I was born in the US. My dad born in Vietnam but lives in the US. 
 I was texting my dad and he kept referring Buddha as a god. I personally don&#x27;t practice any religions. But from what I read, there isn&#x27;t a god in buddism? That got me thinking, is it practiced differently in Vietnam than in the US?
 He was texting me that whether or I was born with one arm, wheel chair bound, or gay, that he still loves me because I was Buddha god gift to him?
 Edit. Sorry did not mean to god gift. His exact words were &quot;god give ba boy or girl or gay ba love all&quot;.

I&#x27;ve been wondering what kind of spice or seasoning they used to get the shrimps so red. It tastes kinda like the stuff people put on xôi mặn. Thank you in advance

                              <span>Sorry if this kind of question has already been asked. I’ve lived in Vietnam for 7 years and tried my fair share of dishes.. some of my favorites being bún riêu, chả cá, bún chả, cơm sườn, cơm rang dưa bò, and pho cuốn. I used to write about food and honestly if it’s a popular dish I’ve probably tried it! 
 Im curious to try some more niche dishes - things you don’t see every day. Perhaps specialities from remote areas. Something like cơm hến in Huế, for example. 
 Let me know some of your gems 💎 thanks.

                              <span>I (F) am travelling to Vietnam next week with my Boyfriend (super excited about this, fingers crossed) 
 I&#x27;ll be staying in Danang for the first few days and have a day trip planned to Hoi A on a weekday. My plan is to use Grab for a cab ride back to Danang at night. I&#x27;m seeking advice on the optimal departure time from Hoi An at night, wondering when Grab taxi services typically stop operating in the area.
 The intent is to maximise night time at Hoi An because I have heard the city is very charming at night but I can’t stay in Hoi an and have to come back to Danang at night.
 Additionally, I&#x27;d like to know if traveling at night in this route is considered safe?

 Edit 1: Absolutely overwhelmed by not just the openness but also the support for each other in this thread. Such an eye-opener for me personally. Loving the spirit everyone!!!
 Edit 2: I especially love the openness to share how much we make here! For some reason, I was taught that talking about salary is sensitive and whatnot but why we need to hide it right!!! It only benefits employers if we hide it 😆

                              <span>So, I was job hunting, and this company (they claimed they&#x27;re Vissan which is a decently big Food product company in Vietnam) contacted me. They sent an email for a physical interview that is set for this weekend, in the meanwhile they did this &quot;online prequalification&quot; that has to go through Telegram.
 The first part of this bullcrap is an MBTI test(?) that contains only like 5 questions. Am I that out of touched to the HR world that MBTI is a standard thing now?
 The second part is the relatively well-known scam that has been floating around recently, which is inputting data and get money from a lottery platform, all in the guys of &quot;making extra revenue&quot;. First they sent me 150k to add to the platform, so I played along for a bit, got 330k in return. They seems to be impressed that they started telling me about the 4 tiers of data entry, which basically is an ever increasing amount of money in return for a (supposedly) even higher amount. Of course that first run was a trial period, the 2nd run will be a 40-60 shares of profit for the company. And on top of it, the lowest tier they put up is 600k, which is just above the amount that I just earned, which means I have to pour money out of my own pocket for them.
 Here&#x27;s where I cut things off. This is too many red flags with screaming horns in my head. No fucking way a company would take money from their applicants. The funniest thing is that they even have the audacity to breath out that sentence I screenshotted above. I guess taking 330k from them is not much but it still filled my pettiness with something close to pride.
 So tl;dr: I have an encounter with a scam group that masquerading as a legit company. Took some money from them instead.

                              <span>Hi, I have food-related question here: are beef or pork intestines popular dishes in Vietnam?
 I have plan to come to vietnam second time. i want to cook some korean food for bf extended family. My favorite one is Gopchang (grilled pork and beef intestines)
 I asked bf, but he said it’s not popular. I guess he just wants me to persuade me to cook another dishes, because he can not eat intestines 😚😙😗
 If you guys eat intestines, what is your favorite type of cooking? In Korea, we often do barbecue (grill). Are there any Korean dishes, which Vietnamese people love? I’m willing to learn and cook for them
 Last time, I asked “how to impress viet parents” in this sub. Your suggestions helped me a lot, and I was successful. Thank you 🙏 🙏

 Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!
 edit: preferably something not Dior or Chanel( because I know she has a bunch), would something like Hourglass, Glossier, or Kosas work? She&#x27;s in her late 20s.

                              <span>Greetings all. I bought some of this grape candy to try and was surprised to find a very hard kernel inside. My kids chomped right down into it, assuming it was a hard candy intentionally placed at the center of this soft jelly-like candy. I just had a crown placed so no way I’m biting something this hard, haha!
 Any idea what the kernel is? I tried to take a picture of it (2nd photo). Many thanks in advance!

                              <span>This goes back by about five generations at least but does anyone else have stories of relatives who were sent to Reunion Island due to French slaver trade or know more about the history of that place and era around 1600-1700?
 I&#x27;m not interested in raising animosities but would like to learn more about the era and see if others are searching or have their own family stories from the era as there&#x27;s word from a grandparent&#x27;s grandparent that some relatives were captured and sent there. 
 Are there any Vietnamese memorials, communities in Reunion Island or organizations dedicated to those who were stolen as a result?

                              <span>Hi,
 My name’s Dom and I’m part of an all asian theater collective based in Montreal! 
 We are travelling to Vietnam to do research for our next show. We will be in Hanoi from October 24 to 29 and Saigon from 29 to the 2!
 I was wondering if you guys had any theater plays or concerts we could go to while we are there!
 I’ve looked at the productions at the Saigon Opera House but, we’re looking for something a bit more contemporary/avant-garde if that’s possible! 
 Anyways, if you have any artistic recommandations (contemporary danse shows, art museums, alternative music, great coffee shops, librairies,etc..) or are an artist in Vietnam, it would be amazing to connect! 
 Thanks!

                              <span>This question might be silly but I’m just curious. I’m watching Young Sheldon (the series is set in Medford, Texas in the 80s-90s btw), and Sheldon has a Vietnamese friend named Tam. His mom always packs dimsum for him, to the point he’s sick of it.
 Dimsum is generally a Chinese food. I know we have dimsum here too but it’s still thought of as a Chinese food, or đồ Hoa.
 So my question is, do Vietnamese Americans have dim sum for lunch that often too? Or is it just another case of filmmakers/showrunners mixing up Asian people and following stereotypes?
 Again, this is just me contemplating about things in life. No big deal either way. So let me know your perspective. Thank you.

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 Im coming to Vietnam, to Ho Chi Minh 11th October, and I&#x27;m really confused. We have 11 days available and we returning to the same airport. My question is: What to do there? :) I had a lot of work before holiday and I couldn&#x27;t prepare for this. Im starting now :) 
 I was wondering about rental motorbike, but im not sure cause im going with my girlfriend and we have 2 big backpacks. What do you think guys?
 And im looking for something special, im not big fan of architecture, rather we prefer local experience and nature. I don&#x27;t like the crowds too, but I know that&#x27;s normal in big cities and popular attractions. 
 ​
 In short - can you give us some hidden gems? And what do you think about rental 2 bikes ( My GF is driver too) and traveling from Ho Chi Minh to Hoi An. Or maybe we should take a plane and rent bikes there? And last but not least - weather. Im a little nervous when I see a forecast.

But I don&#x27;t know where to start or to get actual sources from, would be helpful if anyone recommend where to learn starting from the beginning, either in Tiếng Việt or English is fine. Cảm ơn

                              <span>As per title, recently those type of questions pop up rather frequently in this sub to the point I find it unreasonable. 
 The more of those questions pop up and the more I read into it, the less I see it is related to the Vietnamese country/ the culture/ the people.
 It might only have to do with that particular, very specific family/ relationship/ situation being in question. Regardless the whole nation is called into question for some behavior.
 You guys do know that Vietnam is a country of over 100m population, with polarized income and living conditions, plus having worldwide diasporas (in North America, Australia, European continent, African continent, East Asia, the Middle East) so finding an average Nguyen is nigh impossible, right???
 Instead of asking “Why my Vietnamese relative treat me like shit?” or “Why Vietnamese male drink coffee all morning and doesn’t go to work?” People can rephrase it such as “why my relative treat me like shit?” - does the fact that they are Vietnamese or Vietnamese immigrants play any roles in the question?

                              <span>Apologies if you are tired of recent threads with similar titles, but I am curious what perspectives Vietnamese people here can offer about my country and people. I have met many Việt kiều (越僑) over the years.

                              <span>long story short, i’m a 19 year old girl studying in America. My dad has 13 other siblings most of which live in America as well, and for whatever reason it’s like every week they pick and choose whether to treat me, my mom, and my dad like shit or not. it’s like a sick ranking! it’s horrible. especially after my dad died and they barely cared, he died in a horrible car accident too, and yet we barely get any phone calls, much less any sympathy at all from them. it’s been 10 months now that he’s gone and yet they always gossip, body-shame, manipulative, clout-chase, and make me and my mom feel horrible! and we didn’t even do anything… my mom is vietnamese too and she’s the sweetest person ever. just, why? why are they so mean? is it because they are vietnamese? or jealous? what’s going on? i always feel like i’m doing something wrong, like i’m actually too pu**y, but heck am i gonna say to them, i don’t like ur 30 LV bags?

                              <span>Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m half Vietnamese, and I was not raised by my Vietnamese side. I&#x27;m the oldest of 6 kids my father had. Initially, my father didn&#x27;t want any part of me when my mother got pregnant because I was an accident. He impregnated my mom when he was 25, and she was 15. Before I was born, he tried to persuade my mom to have an abortion. I met him for the first time at the age of 5 and then reconnected with the family at the age of 12. My stepmom is mostly the reason why I wasn&#x27;t around, as my father lied to her and never disclosed my existence until my mom basically gave him an ultimatum to accept me as his son. If he didn&#x27;t, she would take him to court for child support, which she did, and he paid until I turned 18. My stepmom is also the reason I re-entered the family …</span>

                              <span>I’m a woman born in Europe and my parents are Vietnamese.
 My father teaches me that it’s a woman’s job to take care of the household and the kids. Meanwhile he expects me to do a master’s degree and work full time as well. He teaches me things like: - It’s fine for men to have a high body count before marriage but girls should keep themselves pure - It’s a woman’s job to do the cooking, cleaning, etc. (including things like having to cut my husband’s finger and toe nails) - I shouldn’t do a doctor’s degree because men are deterred from women with higher education - It’s justified if my husband cheats if I don’t provide him with a warm meal and children
 My mother works full time as well but he feels entitled to everything she does for him. If there’s no food or the food is too salty for example, he starts to shout and says “without me, you would be living in the streets.”
 Is that normal for our Vietnamese culture? I’ve never seen him grateful for how we support him.

                              <span>Hello! As the title already states, which city is the best to visit in December?
 My best friend and I haven&#x27;t seen each other for years (we live in different countries now) and we&#x27;re thinking of travelling and reuniting in Vietnam. 
 We both would like to indulge ourselves in Vietnam&#x27;s food and culture. We both enjoy long walks, have some drinks, and trying out some things new! (something more &quot;local&quot; and maybe not too touristy haha)
 Any recommendations and suggestions are highly appreciated. Thank you! :)

                              <span>I will be backpacking through Vietnam and Cambodia in November and am looking for what kind of shoes I should bring. Looking at a lot of reddit posts I&#x27;ll probably bring some sandals (maybe Columbia Breaksiders?) for light walks and water activities but I will also go to Sa Pa and other places where I would like to hike. Since the weather won&#x27;t be as hot as in the summer, do you guys think some light hiking boots would be a good idea as a second pair and if so do you have any suggestions (I looked at the Merrell Nova 3 Mid for example)? I like hiking shoes that go over your ankles to prevent injuries on rugged terrain.
 Thank you guys in advance!

 Not super interested in doing a cruise but a traveller in passing mentioned Cat Ba does fishing boat tours. Haven’t been able to find much information online about them, do they exist and what do they involve in finding out about them? Also any other general Cat Ba recommendations are welcome!

                              <span>Hoping this messages helps other travelers - if you’re from the US and are trying to use your Wise card it’s not supported here. Cambodia too
 After reading that it’s not uncommon for foreign bank cards to not work at some ATMs, I laced up my walking shoes and tried literally 17 ATMs, all unsuccessfully. I always tried 2 mil, I tried adding money to my USD wallet, I tried walking to the CitiBank atm, nothing. Eventually I went to the Wise website to see if something was locked with my card and I stumbled on a support page that listed countries that US accounts won’t work in. 
 I have a card from my US bank so I’ll probably just take the fee on the chin or consider using the Western Union app to send myself some money in the morning.

                              <span>I am vietnamese living in Canada for 6 years. I had a Canadian gf, and she’ll become my fiancé soon this year.
 I have a plan to come back to my country and work there for a long time. I asked my gf, and she agreed to relocate with me. We’ll move to vn in February next year. I am happy she’s willing to follow me. But I’m worried that she may struggle to adapt to living and workenvironment in Vietnam.
 As a foreigner living vn, what were your difficulties in living and working? Esp female foreigners (female and male may have different concerns). How did you overcome them?
 What can I do to help her go through tough time? She doesn’t need to worry about money, living place. We only care how she can get a good job, have positive experience and avoid being culture shocked or anxious
 She wants to learn the language. Can you suggest any language centers or tutors teaching foreigners Vietnamese?
 Any Vietnamese or foreigner having the same situation here, can you share your experience? I appreciate all your suggestions!!!!
 You may wonder why I don’t stay in Canada. I actually got PR of Canada. I am working for an American firm. The company is building a new factory in a north province of vietnam. I was chosen to work as one of managers in that factory, because I can speak the language. I will work in my home country like “expat” 😂😂. This is also a good chance for me to make a big chunk of money.😁

 Any usual pitfalls/quirks about landlords and realtors? Should something be explicitly checked for and settled at the contract stage? Are large deposits and commissions common?
 Any info from your experience would be of a great help :)
 I will be most likely settling in District 7, since thats where my office will be, and hearing that its a lot more spacious, green and unconjested compared to the center districts.

                              <span>Hi! I’m strongly considering working remotely in Asia since my employer does not mind global relocation. 
 A few stops on this hypothetical trip will be Philippines, Japan and Vietnam.
 Never been to Asia, no clue what to expect. 
 Are there many digital nomads working abroad in this fashion? Are foreigners generally well regarded?
 Where are some common or recommended areas to do something like this?
 Forgive my ignorance, thought I’d post here to get some general feedback.

 Trước đó 1-2 tháng mình đã đem laptop đi vệ sinh, dán keo ở tiệm người quen của ông cậu.
 Tụ dưng 2 ngày nay Quạt laptop Dell 7730 của mình lại kêu không ngừng nghỉ , dù chả có tác vụ nặng nào ngoài lướt Chrome như thường lệ, trước đây trừ khi dùng Ai, Ps mới kêu to.
 ** Trước đây lướt Chrome quạt có kêu nhưng ko liên tục 2 ngày ạ.Hình 1 là ảnh mình chụp dc khi bật máy tính, dựa vào từ khóa &quot;manufactoring&quot; đi tra GG thì có kết quả hình 2 ạ, câu cuối cùng của nó làm mình rén quá.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always wondered why the Viets always drive in different lanes at the same exact speed in highways and express ways (including big fucking trucks staying in all the lanes, super frustrating but never mind), and after watching this video I realize it&#x27;s a bigger problem that it&#x27;s affecting many other countries, even the US
 Since I&#x27;m from the EU, I had no idea how it worked elsewhere, but it&#x27;s just common sense in the EU to not stay constantly in the left lane unless I&#x27;m passing someone else. I believe in some countries you can get even fined if you occupy the left lane for no reason 
 Do you believe a culture of left lane for passing only can be adopted here? Or is it too late now to create such culture? (talking about the highways reserved for cars only, not the normal roads)

                              <span>Hi everyone! Australian here who will be travelling for the first time to Vietnam for one week. I love Vietnamese food (Banh Mi, soups and salads) and excited to try authentic fare as well as experience the culture. Some of my questions and concerns needing answers from travelers who have been there: -Visa. I believe visitors will need a visa to enter. Could anyone share the link to apply for the visa application? Can it be an online application, how much and how long to get the visa. -Money to get around. Are credit cards accepted or only cash? -Wifi access. Would getting a local SIM to access the internet be the best way? Do the Vietnamese telcos offer inexpensive prepaid SIMs and roughly how much? -Must sees and do&#x27;s in Ho Chi Minh. Recommended places of interest to see and unique experiences would be great. -Souvenirs. What&#x27;s good to bring home from Vietnam? I would appreciate your practical tips and suggestions. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an American who&#x27;s been living in South Vietnam (HCMC and Can Tho) for over a year now and I absolutely love this place. The environment is beautiful. The communities are strong and supportive. The people are kind, welcoming, and patient. There is one thing that drives me crazy though. I routinely find the process of asking a question and receiving a response from Vietnamese people to be painful. The same goes for politely declining invitations. I say no politely time after time after time and it doesn&#x27;t seem like anyone hears me unless I get animated, frustrated, exasperated, or leave. The same goes for answering questions. They SAY something in response, but they don&#x27;t answer, they often just change the subject, reiterate their previous statement without answering my question , or mov…</span>

                              <span>Hello, 
 As the title says, I got an offer from ILA for Can Tho! On the surface, things sound pretty decent, especially since they offer a housing allowance. 
 My pay according to the contract (before taxes) is 473,000 VND an hour (20 teaching hours a week), on top of a housing allowance of 7,000,000 VND per month. It&#x27;s a standard 12-month contract. 
 My main priorities are to learn how to be a good teacher, save as much as I can, and try to avoid stress as much as possible. That being said, I want to make sure ILA is a good fit for me. I don&#x27;t mind the region I&#x27;m staying in (Can Tho) since I doubt I&#x27;m gonna leave my apartment much... for me, the priority is just learning a local culture and saving money. 
 Does anyone have any experiences with ILA that they&#x27;d be willing to share? I understand that avoiding stress is impossible as a teacher, but I just want to make sure that they&#x27;ve got a good support system in place. The last thing I want is to be overworked or overwhelmed with stuff that they didn&#x27;t mention in the interview or the contract... only to realize I could&#x27;ve had that same experience here, in the states. 
 Long story shrot, this is the only offer I think I&#x27;ll be getting from Vietnam... and I&#x27;m stuck between taking it and just giving up and sticking to living in the states. I don&#x27;t want to go overseas and get burned out on teaching since I&#x27;m gonna be doing that for a living... 
 Please let me know, thank you.

                              <span>For my fellow expats and everyone&#x27;s safety, last week I didn&#x27;t have enough cash on hand so i had to use my credit card at a lounge here in HCMC however, i woke up this morning and found out i was charged a ridiculous amount by the same place. (which i didn&#x27;t make). To be honest i think they got a hold of my credit card information and now i have to dispute this. I just thought i&#x27;d share this so please be careful and aware everybody. 
 It&#x27;s in D1 , and the credit card dispute team can&#x27;t help me right now at the moment because of the time zone differences so I&#x27;ll have to wait until night time to settle this . 
 This really sucks, but i would share this because I wouldn&#x27;t want anybody to deal with a situation like this, especially overseas.

 6 women, including 4 Vietnamese, were rescued by French police in the back of a refrigerated truck after sending a text message asking for help.
 French police announced that they stopped a refrigerated truck on September 27 on the E15 highway near Drace, north of Lyon and discovered 6 women, including 4 Vietnamese and two Iraqis, in the cramped trunk full of bananas. BBC reported on September 28.
 Laetitia Francart, prosecutor of the Villefranche-sur-Saone region, north of the city of Lyon, eastern France, said the group of women got into the back of a truck with Irish license plates hoping to reach Britain or Ireland.
 However, this vehicle only carries goods to Dunkirk, France and then hea…</span>

They usually watch reruns when it is on and always laugh and enjoy it, but when I ask them about actually going to see it live they seem indifferent.
 Are older Vietnamese parents actually into PBN and secretly would love to go? Or do they not really care for the program all too much?

 I would like to start with my first experience with this issue. After I finished with my university, I got hired into a Vietnamese branch of a Japanese self-driving car start up. Things were fine back then except for one thing. My CEO. He was a total Japanese-supremacy guy (He is Vietnamese, btw).

 Xin chào mọi người, post này tôi sẽ nói tiếng Việt.
 Gần đây… không hẳn là thời gian gần đây nữa mà là hơn 8 tháng rồi… đã xảy ra một vụ án thương tâm tại Chung cư Centana ở thủ đức. Nạn nhân ở đây là người phụ nữ Phan Thị Mỹ Hằng.
 Thoạt đầu tưởng rằng chỉ là trò bịp bợm của ai đó trên mạng nhưng hóa ra không phải. Khi thấy điểm bất ngờ nên tôi đã nghiên cứu qua thử thì thấy có rất nhiều điểm đáng để nói trong vụ án lần này.
 Trước khi tới tình tiết phân tích chuyên sâu, nếu ai đã đọc quyển sách Đêm trường tăm tối của Tử Kim Trần thì sẽ thấy sự giống y hệt xã hội chúng ta đang sống hiện tại. Càng đọc, càng thấy sự na ná và tôi mong nếu bạn đang đọc đến dòng này, thì hãy đọc tiếp vì bạn sẽ cảm thấy bất ngờ.

                              <span>Specifically my cat. She is a 6kg (~12lb) American Short Hair, fully vaccinated. Please let me know the necessary documents and procurers for bringing cats into Vietnam through Noi Bai International Airport. 
 It would also be greatly appreciated if yall can give me some recommendations on airlines that will be allowing pets. I&#x27;m coming from Canada and it looks like I will be transferring through an intermediate airport. Last time I checked Taiwan doesn&#x27;t allow live animals in so Eva Air is cancelled out. 
 Thanks a lot.

                              <span>Hello! Asking for a friend...
 What are the realistic job opportunities in HCMC and/or Hanoi for someone who speaks neither English nor Vietnamese? More specifically, for someone who speaks Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese (has Italian and Brazilian citizenship), and who has work experience in programming, IT, and graphic design, and also has &quot;uncertified&quot; skills in construction and furniture building? 
 I know that being a Digital Nomad or working remotely for a European country are obvious answers, but I&#x27;m wondering about on-the-ground, potentially Visa-sponsored gigs? I do not yet live in Vietnam, so when I search on my Dell from the USA, even if I search in Spanish (my second language), my results are highly skewed and unhelpful.
 If anyone has links, knows of good recruiting companies, or anything, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it! Equally, if the answer is that my friend would be SOL, thank you for the frankness 😅

                              <span>I just got to Da Nang. I took a Grab to my hotel, but didnt realize the Grab wanted me to pay in cash. I eventually found an ATM and paid the guy 100,000 instead of 57,000 (which is still cheap by US terms i think).
 How much cash should I keep on hand? In case a place Im at does not accept cards. Also, how do I find an ATM?

                              <span>I just don&#x27;t know, I just find Chinese music and lyric much more lyrical, meaningful and impactful. I&#x27;m just attracted to it more, the lyric, the melody, the words. 
 I do not support and could not stand China&#x27;s conservative politic and misogynistic attitude. I hate them to the core, but I just really really love the art side of its culture, its music and its architecture. I&#x27;m just much more drawn to them and find them more attractive. It&#x27;s just that, you know, China has been our life-long &quot;enemy&quot;, I feel like it&#x27;s wrong of me to like things from them

                              <span>There seems to be a lot of regional variation. I think the standard rule (if there is such a thing), is to use the same address (anh, chi, em) based on one&#x27;s own sibling&#x27;s age. But what about if the husband or wife of your sibling is younger than you? In most traditions, you still follow the &quot;standard rules&quot;, but I&#x27;ve met people who address the younger (in age) sibling-in-law as &quot;chu, cau, co, di&quot;, as though they were addressing them in place of their children. What tradition do you follow, dear Redditors?

                              <span>I have a brother. My dad mentioned him once when I was young, didn’t bring him up for years, then finally told me about him again and confirmed it wasn’t a fever dream. 
 My brother would be in his mid to late thirties. My dad was half white and was kicked out of the hospital by my brother’s grandma. He wasn’t allowed to see his son after that. My dad eventually made it to America but has always missed my brother. My grandma did not know of my brother because he was born out of wedlock. I accidentally let it slip. 
 I’m contemplating doing a DNA test and potentially finding him. I want to do an American one as well since my grandpa (my dads father) was a lieutenant during the war. Though, I do want to meet my brother the most. To let him know my dad didn’t willingly abandon him. Have them meet. Help my grandma meet her first grandchild as she always thought I was the first. 
 If anyone has any insight, that’ll be extremely helpful. Thank you.
 Edit: when I ask, “do people in Vietnam do these tests” it’s because I’m asking if it’s commonplace and if it’s as popular in other countries. I want to see if there is any percentage of a chance it’ll work.

                              <span>In your opinion, other than the An Thuong area, what is a desirable neighorhood(s) in Danang for locals?
 An Nhon (near Korea town) seems pretty nice. Also the area near the Foreign Language University.
 But i have a hunch that I havnt really found the desirable, nice Danang neighborhood yet. Any tips where I can look?

 We love to drink and eat good food. She is very interested in renting a moped, but I can’t seem to find a tour where a guide takes us around and we drive them ourselves. Something unique would be awesome!!
