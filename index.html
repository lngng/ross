                              <span>I was wondering if ancestor worship was strictly limited to ancestors (as in: people from previous generations) or if other deceased people from the family might be included as well. For example, in the case of a child passing away before their parents do, would they be integrated within the worship practices of the parents or grandparents, or not at all?

We all travel differently, and this style of itinerary is ours (experienced). However, I&#x27;m not sure if my listed method of transportation is the best option in reality. Can you please give me feedback on that? Please also give your &quot;must eat/see&quot; for these places if you have any!

 Edit: I have my tickets booked for landing into Hanoi airport on Sunday and leaving from Ho Chi Minh on Saturday evening. 
 I did this to break my long journey to my home and saved a couple hundred dollars in the process.

                              <span>Hi there,
 Visiting Hanoi for 2-3 weeks, and my partner and I are interested to meet some other artists. We&#x27;re in video game design, music, and videography. Any recommendations for where we could find live music or any sort of a scene related to the above? Limitation is that we don&#x27;t speak Vietnamese, so I understand if that might be quite hard at a deeper level.
 Similarly, what part of town would fit us best? We&#x27;ve both travelled a lot, and don&#x27;t need the coddling of having a boulangerie and pizza parlor within arms reach at all times.

                              <span>We just booked an early flight to Hanoi for almost 4 full days and wanted to do the 3D2N Ninh Binh - Ha Long cruise tour. I’m more interested in nature scenes and not a big city person, so a day in Hanoi is probably enough for me. The tour would have us stay the first night in Ninh Binh and then drive us to Ha Long the next day and stay overnight on a cruise. I read here that booking might be cheaper in the quarter but I’m not sure where to find them or which tour we should go with? I saw one online for $250 each which isn’t cheap. Would they also charge extra for water and other necessities? And would it feel too rushed to do this tour?

                              <span>Hello, my name is Leonardo and I´m currently an architecture master student at the Tecnical University of Munich. In this semester we are studying communities and their relationship to water and my group decided to focus on Ho Chi Minh City and the Saigon River.

Is there any other way around this or could we get tickets on the day?

 I just want to gather people that love 3d printers in Vietnam.
 I have a subreddit r/in3dvietnam which share free 3D files and news in a daily basis, if you are interested in, feel free to join.
 Since the community is about Vietnam so maybe Vietnamese is the main language, but I could use English as well if you are a foreigner.
 Thanks and warm regards.

However, I kept receiving notifications that the addressee not available at the time of delivery. I have also contacted the addressee but they said they did not receive any calls or emails. Who and where can I contact about this issue? And where can I check the contact information that entered?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m from Germany, East Germany to be precise. Back when Germany was divided, there were around 60,000 Vietnamese guest workers in the former GDR (soviet occupation zone). I myself was too young to experience the GDR. 
 We are always accused of racism, but when I talk to my parents, grandparents or other older people and ask them about Vietnamese people in the GDR, I only hear great acknowledgement and appreciation. Statements like &quot;good and honest people&quot;, &quot;they were very decent and hard-working&quot;, &quot;calm and level-headed&quot;, or &quot;we didn&#x27;t see them as foreigners&quot;. I have never heard anyone say anything bad about Vietnamese people. I wish I could say the same about Muslims from the MENA countries, today. I just wanted to let you know that in the past, as well as today, you are very much appreciated in Germany.

                              <span>I left Vietnam with my mom when I was a baby. My dad died drowning in the sea trying to escape a year before us. 
 I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for two weeks now and I was actually quite surprised by how much poverty there still is here. It seems that so many people are struggling and making so little money. The diet, stress, sunlight exposure seem to all contribute to the population having smaller bodies/frames and looking much older than their counter parts in the west. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;11&quot; with a muscular build and I feel like freaking captain America walking around here. 
 All this makes me very grateful for my life. But I also feel guilty because I realize everything I have was given to me. I didn&#x27;t choose to the west. I am just a product of my parents and environment. It was my mere chance that I am where I am and who I am. One little change in my past, like my mom deciding not to try to escape or getting caught escaping and I could be in saigon trying to hustle like everyone else here. 
 I am also saddened to see how much Vietnamese ppl struggle and work so hard in this ungodly humid and hot temperature. It seems like they have so few opportunities to advance and make a better life. 
 I have heard things are slowly changing though. More people are able to get higher education and the middle class is growing. I hope when I come back in ten years things will be much more different. 
 As viet kieus, do you guys feel the same gratitude and guilt as I do?

                              <span>I noticed that there are tourist restaurants and there are hole in the walls where locals eat. 
 As a viet kieu I have no problem going to a hole in the wall to order and eat. But when I go there I notice people there staring at me. And sometimes the workers have a bit of an attitude? I might just be paranoid or over thinking it. I speak Vietnamese (semi fluent) so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re annoyed that I can&#x27;t order properly. 
 What do you guys think? Am I just being paranoid or is there really a locals only vibe at some places?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for a couple weeks now and I&#x27;ve run into a bunch of foreigners and tourists. Most were pretty normal and nice. 
 But I finally met a complete ass hat last night. White dude from Canada. He was completely wasted, chain smoking, and yelling at people around him. He kept mentioning how he came here to find a wife and how he hasn&#x27;t gotten laid at all yet. Big surprise, big fat white loud mouth hasn&#x27;t gotten laid yet. Shocking women all around the world don&#x27;t enjoy rude idiot drunk assholes. 
 God it&#x27;s embarrassing that I&#x27;m also from Canada. 🇨🇦
 What type of tourists do locals hate the most?

                              <span>My family has been traveling for 3 years and have visited many different countries both developed and undeveloped. We&#x27;re currently in Vietnam for the first time and although it&#x27;s exciting here, I&#x27;m getting tired of a few things that we&#x27;re not used to. Almost every day we have been here, the locals try scamming us. From the street sellers who give me less change money than I&#x27;m supposed to get, the &quot;take a photo with my fruit basket on a stick&quot; and then heckling you to give photo money or buy something, &quot;take a free donut&quot;, etc. It&#x27;s wearing me down as I&#x27;m a very honest person and have tried my entire adult life to support little mom and pop shops with their businesses. We just spent 2 months in korea and a week in Japan and those locals were very honest, did not heckle, and if they offered a free sample, it was really free. Plus the lack of consideration. Last night at 1:30am, there is construction still going on like a circular saw and banging metal. I wake up to it, and have to sleep with it. Does the police or other locals not care about quiet sleeping time? We have never encountered something like this on a constant basis in any other country we&#x27;ve traveled to.
 We are scheduled to leave here next week, then off to Ho Chi Mihn for a week, and then after that we had scheduled Da Nang for a whole month but now considering canceling Da Nang if it&#x27;s going to be more of the same. So for people who have traveled to Da Nang, can you tell me if we will be facing the same situation as here in Old Quarter Hanoi?
 ​
 We have met some really nice people in nice shops who offer us good service and the right change so we have been returning to those spots to eat. There&#x27;s a coconut/smoothie spot we enjoy so everyday we buy 5 drinks.

                              <span>Hi! My family and I will be travelling to Vietnam in January 2024 for a month. I was wondering what the weather is like there? We will be spending a week in HCMC, a week in Hue and some days in maybe Da Nang, Nha Trang or Da Lat. I’m getting some mixed information that it’ll be hot, maybe chilly or foggy. 
 We are from Canada so I would really like to know what I should be mindful of and pack for. TIA!

                              <span>Hi all, we’re flying to Hanoi soon on Vietnam Airlines, a Boeing 787. We’ll be in regular economy.
 I’m interested in buying a Bluetooth transmitter so I can use my own noise cancelling headphones with the inflight entertainment. Does anyone know if those planes have single or double headphone Jack inputs? Can’t find the info online anywhere!
 Cheers!

 Is 1 hour 30 mins a sufficient layover time for this?

 I usually travel with &quot;Iati&quot; insurance, but it&#x27;s meant for traveling, not for longer stays. What insurance do you recommend me?

                              <span>Hi I just wanted to give an update on this poll I did a while back: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/16jlwu5/market_research_for_handbagtote_bag_fashion_start/
 ​
 I&#x27;m slowly launching the tote bags that I described in the original post. I feel a little bit embarrassed to try to push this new project out there but what do I have to lose then to share my experience right?
 I am so thankful for the people who voted in the poll and gave their opinions. It really helped me narrow down my focus. This is a passion project that stemmed from a long overdue trip to Vietnam.
 I was born in a refugee camp in Malaysia and moved to Canada when I was 4. I only been to Vietnam once when I was 14 on a family trip. Then this year back in April I decided to go back to Vietnam on my own at the age of 30. It was an incredible experience reconnecting with family and making new friends as a solo traveler who can barely speak Vietnamese. I have to say that Vietnamese locals are so open and love to connect with foreigners - I think that&#x27;s what makes the country so great!
 Anyways, I got a felt tote bag from a popular Men&#x27;s wear brand there and walked around with it in Canada, constantly getting compliments on the bag. I decided to start my own brand selling these felt tote bags with my own designs. Right now the designs and branding is focused on the soft &quot;Asian&quot; girl aesthetic but I hope to venture beyond these tote bags to explore different aspects of being Vietnamese living outside of Vietnam. I feel that we are constantly trying to connect to heritage while building a unique Western-Vietnamese experience navigating two cultures.
 I hope you guys follow The New Win on social media and check out the website: bythenewwin.com.
 As you can see the poll winner &quot;Saigon District 1&quot; inspired the first design. I&#x27;m gearing up for the first Drop soon and I hope you check back for more Drops in the future.

Do you any tips on what &amp; where we could buy some medicine? We are located near Hoan Kiem Lake. Also, some easy food places recommendations are welcomed (even though Vietnamese food is very delicious, might be smart to go easy a bit). Thanks in advance!

                              <span>So I’ve been having interviews with Vietnamese employers for a teaching job and they’ve all been lovely so far. But someone interviewed me today and she commented on the teaching demo I sent. She said “I saw your teaching demo. You were so fat there! But I see you now and you’re not fat. Did you lose weight?” and she waited for me to answer that question haha. Is this normal and should I expect more blunt comments like this? I’m not fat but I’m not skinny either. I’d say I’m midsize/curvy.

                              <span>as the title says.
 today i had a call with my mom, and apparently in my hometown parents are really worried about their kids watching weird, loud videos where soldiers brutally killing humanoid heads in giant toilets. and i immediately knew it&#x27;s the pointless &quot;skibidi toilet&quot; trend.
 this used to be a harmless thing where gamers made silly videos using a game called Garry&#x27;s Mod just to have fun with each others.
 but Vietnamese trashy creators, as they always do, now catch up with the thing and try to create the most controversy and harmful things ever, while pasting &quot;skibidi toilet&quot; into the title to trick kids into giving them more views. horrible thumbnails with real Vietnamese faces popping out of a toilet, and you call that children&#x27;s watchable contents?
 it&#x27;s sad to see how abusive Vietnamese trash content creators have become. in the past, they literally made videos like Spiderman having weird thoughts with freaking Elsa from Frozen.

                              <span>Me and my friends booked a flight to Thailand by searching through Skyscanner, booking was done through the third party Agoda platform. After a few days, we received an email that stated that our flight is changed from 12pm departure to 9pm departure from Singapore. We have activities already planned out and I feel it is unfair for them to change the timing without giving us the option to refund.
 We have tried calling them via the contact found on their website and Google maps (Call center 19001886 or send email to [19001886@vietjetair.com](mailto:19001886@vietjetair.com)) but nobody picked up, all their social media links to nowhere and we even tried visiting the office in Singapore, which is non existent (&quot;Vietjet Air Singapore Ticketing Office&quot; on Google Maps). 
 Has anyone encountered this situation before? Any advice on what we can do? (Ideally a refund)

                              <span>Hello ! I&#x27;m creating an app to train to recognize Vietnamese tones! (because I am struggling with them 😅). You can try it if you want, it&#x27;s free but it is only available on android phones for now :
 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.kayafugames.vietnamtones
 Feel free to tell me what you think. I&#x27;m wondering if the progression is not too quick - maybe I should add more levels with only two tones to choose from.
 Enjoy! :)

 https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3240554/vietnamese-decry-construction-borders-unesco-site-ha-long-bay-killing-everything
 A huge residential complex being built on the borders of Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay prompted a public outcry in the Southeast Asian country on Monday, as concerns mount over human impacts that have degraded the Unesco World Heritage site.
 The bay, famed for its brilliant turquoise waters dotted with towering rainforest-topped limestone islands, is one of Vietnam’s most popular tourist destinations, attracting more than seven million visitors last year.
 The shore and the surrounding town are already heavily developed. But on Sunday pictures were published in state media of an enormous construction site running through the waters – and next to the spectacular karsts – of Bai Tu Long Bay, which borders Ha Long.

                              <span>This is a serious question and is for discussion purposes.
 As I know, the official salary of officials is very low, even lower than workers. Even the prime minister&#x27;s salary is only around 20,000,000 VND.
 This creates the first problem: because they are the only ones who can solve problems (administrative, legal) for the people. They will create barriers to make the problem more difficult to solve. To get bribe money.
 The higher their position, the more difficult problems they can solve, and the more bribes they can get. Because these positions can all be bought with money. This environment, of course, becomes a potential market for investment.
  
Want to become a traffic policeman standing at the intersection? Money.
 Want to become president or vice president of the province? Money.

                              <span>Just curious if anyone here has experience with motorbike guided tours. It seems QT is a reputable company and I reached out to them to ask for pricing. I haven&#x27;t heard back yet. What is a fair price for the ha giang loop ?

                              <span>hi! i’m planning on going to southeast asia in 2024, im seeing SO much conflicting answers on when is the best weather. Rough loose itinerary i’m thinking-
 fly into Bangkok—North Thailand—Laos—Vietnam—Cambodia—South Thailand &amp; Islands
 i want to travel down the whole country starting in the north but my main things i’m most excited for are Ha Giang Loop and Ha Long Bay private island overnight through the hostel. so want best weather for those. thank you!

                              <span>Seeking advice!!
 Background: I&#x27;m Vietnamese- born and raised in vietnam but moved to United States at very young age. I&#x27;m still able to retain the language. My girlfriend is Egyptian born and raised in Egypt, and also moved to United States at a very young age. You rarely see Vietnamese/Egyptian couples in the states...which makes our relationship very unique. Both of our culture values are very similar. Most would think that Arab are muslim...which is true but my gf and I are both christian but different domination...anyways that&#x27;s a whole different conversation of it own. My parents are very traditional. they would want me to date and marry to a Vietnamese girl. However to me, i should be able date anyone regardless of culture/race. Every time i would talk about girls outside of the culture they will give racist remarks.
 Question: How would i go about introducing my Girlfriend to my traditional Vietnamese parents without them having a prejudice mindset?

                              <span>In a recent meeting in India, billionaire Gautam Adani sat down with Pham Nhat Vuong, Chairman of Vingroup, to discuss potential business opportunities between India and Vietnam.
 During the discussion, Adani expressed his admiration for Pham Nhat Vuong&#x27;s entrepreneurial journey. He was particularly impressed by how Vuong transitioned from the instant noodle business to becoming a leading force in the production of cutting-edge electric vehicles and advanced battery solutions for global sustainable mobility. All of this was achieved in a remarkably short span of time.

                              <span>Hey! 
 I&#x27;m in Hanoi for three weeks and occasionally need to do some work. I just need a normal desk with an office chair and a monitor. I contacted some co-working spaces, which would be perfect because they charge by the day, but they don&#x27;t offer any hardware (monitor, keyboard and a mouse).
 Another option would be to go to a gaming cafe and just plug their hardware into my laptop. Has anyone done that?
 Would renting the equipment be an option? Tried googling, but only a single really expensive option came up. Buying doesn&#x27;t work as I will be traveling around Vietnam. 
 There should be quite a lot of digital nomads in Vietnam, so someone has to have dealt with the same problem. Didn&#x27;t find any on this subreddit tho.
 Thanks!
 PS! I&#x27;ll probably face the same problem in January at Da Nang, so any info on the way of the land over there would also be much appreciated.

                              <span>What would happen if Vietnam had built nuclear energy ? I heard people say it&#x27;s because geopolitics that prevented us from building nuclear with Russia&#x27;s help.

We know that only nuclear energy can support economy better than renewables. So what are your opinions ?

 The Southeast Asian electronics manufacturing hub is home to Intel&#x27;s largest factory worldwide for assembling, packaging and testing chips, and has been banking on the company further expanding there especially after Joe Biden announced deals to support Vietnam&#x27;s chips industry during a visit in September.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m staying in Ha Long Bay at the FLC resort on December 30th and 31st this year and am planning to celebrate my mother&#x27;s birthday in Ha Long Bay. We&#x27;ll be on the Elite of the Seas cruise the few days before. I want to go over the top for her birthday, with at least a nice dinner, a show etc. Any ideas on how to impress her?

I don’t know how to swim which I know is embarrassing and as it turns out one of the bucket list things to do is in ha long bay is kayaking. We’re doing the cruise which is fine but is kayaking something that’s recommended even for someone who can’t swim? Would I miss out on a lot if I don’t do it? My friends are okay with me just staying on the cruise and waiting but if it’s safe enough then I might give in. Any suggestions or opinions are welcome. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, I’m heading to Vietnam next week and will be visiting Ho Chi Minh City, Hoi An, Ha Long Bay, and Hanoi over the next few weeks. It’s my first time in Vietnam, and I’m excited to explore! 
 I think I’ve got a pretty solid itinerary planned, but since it’s the holiday season I’m hoping to pick up some unique souvenirs and gifts to bring back to the U.S. I found a shop in Ho Chi Minh City called OHQUAO that seems pretty great - unique paper goods/design. Wondering if there are other shops like this people would recommend I check out? I really enjoy shopping for home goods, art/decor, stuff like that.
 Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

                              <span>I&#x27;m visiting danang for a week, have already gone swimming for a few days now and the water seemed muddy but overall quite clean, until today. We were walking along My Khe beach late afternoon in the rain, and suddenly noticed parts of the water got darker， with several cockroaches washed up on shore, some live ones were crawling around that area as well. I was shocked to see the sewage overflowing into the water. Is My Khe beach clean enough to swim? Or any suggestions for other beach areas north or south of my khe that may be more clean/safe?

                              <span>How is gestational diabetes handled in vietnam? Is it something these they for? What are the glucose levels recommended to follow? 
 I’m a vietnamese American living in America and currently pregnant with our first baby. Recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have to meet glucose levels set by American medical institutes. Given that I’m ethnically Asian and grew up eating Asian food at home and maintain Việt culture at home life- I am apt to believe a lot of the American medical standards don’t fit me as I’m not the same genetic or dietary background as most of their standards which is collective studies base on the “average” white person (since white ppl make up the majority of the population in america) so was curious what vietnam did for gestational diabetes 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 My parents have extremely high triglycerides and don&#x27;t show any signs of slowing down their white carbohydrate intake. It is in the 1,000+ range. I tried to find the word in Vietnamese but i haven&#x27;t found it, and I only found words for blood pressure and cholesterol.
 How can I explain it to my parents? My viet is crap and I wasn&#x27;t able to find so many articles on it. I would also like to show them some articles/videos in Vietnamese that will support what my doctor and I agreed on, which is a lower carbohydrate diet and its benefits, and why she should not be eating so many carbohydrates (80% of diet)

 But I noticed that no one ever holds their waist/hips. Seems kind of dangerous right? What if you fall?

                              <span>In 1123–1150, Vietnam managed to repel a combined Khmer and Cham invasion. The Khmer Empire was at its peak of power at that point but it lost to Vietnam.
 In 1075-1077, the Vietnamese Ly Dynasty launched an invasion deep into Song China&#x27;s territory. They were still a small kingdom that only gained independence 100 years ago and were attacking the strongest empire on earth at the time. The Song responded by invading Vietnam but they were defeated.
 The Mongols also invaded Vietnam and were defeated in all 3 times.
 While the Ming Dynasty conquered Vietnam in 1407, they were only able to hold Vietnam for 20 years.
 In 1471, Vietnam managed to wipe out Champa, which was an enemy for over 500 years out of existence. This is akin to France wiping Spain or Germany out of existence.

 We see a post or more about Vietnamese women literally EVERY single day. So far, so good.
 Since it&#x27;s MORE than obvious what you guys want, why don&#x27;t you simply go to one of these waaaay to many happy ending massage parlors or sex workers in the first place, where you get the benefit of knowing what you&#x27;re paying for and also know HOW MUCH you&#x27;re going to pay.
 Two friends visited me once in Hanoi and they were super excited about the chance to get laid with some asian girls. They were talking about it the whole time before they even arrived. Even though i opposed that, I showed them places where they could get what they want, for no more than 1.5M. However, they proceeded to text me in the morning to tell me that they managed to spe…</span>

 EDIT: ‼️he is not blood related‼️ 😫 my grandma married this man, where this man already had two other baby mama’s before my grandma. So this cousin is from this grandpa’s other baby mama’s side where he is a cousin from a mom who married into this grandpa’s family. Even though he considers my grandma also as his grandma, and also texted my mom as an auntie, and I approached him as a cousin because we got introduced as ‘yall are cousins, he is a child from your grandpas side’

                              <span>I&#x27;ve stayed at two hotels now and both were not good. They looked nothing like the pictures and even though they had good reviews, it seems like the reviews were lies. 
 The rooms were terribly small. One had no window whatsoever. The &quot;pool&quot; was like 2 feet deep. The &quot;gym&quot; was two treadmills and a bike. The construction quality of the rooms and bathrooms were shoddy. Everything felt thin and cheap. You can hear everything happening through the walls. 
 On the plus side, the staff were always extremely kind and helpful. I really loved the service. The breakfast nuggets were always good as well. 
 Both hotels were half a million dong per night. 
 Do I just need to find more expensive hotels? What&#x27;s a good budget for something decent but not extravagant? A million dongs?

                              <span>flew into Saigon last week and staying Bien Hoa for about another week(2 weeks in total in vietnam). I&#x27;ve gotten horrible cellphone service since I&#x27;ve been here. only time I&#x27;ve gotten somewhat decent service is when I&#x27;m either on a wifi connection, or when I visited Vung Tau. 
 I&#x27;m American and currently have AT&amp;T cellphone service. wishing I had picked up a Vietnamese sim card before I left the airport. I rely heavily on Google translate to understand different people here.

                              <span>Just want your thoughts on this. 
 I’ll be spending some time up North doing the Ha Giang Loop and Ha Long Bay, I have a few days left to explore Hanoi and was thinking of doing a day trip to Ninh Binh though it could be quite tiring and was thinking of if I should skip that and spend some more time exploring in Hanoi.

                              <span>I ended up getting a little lost on Google reading about people explaining the terms you would use to talk to other people in Vietnamese (chị, cậu, etc.) and I got a bit curious since I didn&#x27;t see anything about this: Is it common to address your cousins differently based on their parents&#x27; age in relation to your own parents? I will add that I am Vietnamese myself, and I call all my cousins whose parents are older than mine &quot;chị/anh&quot; (vice versa for younger and &quot;em&quot;), but is this the standard? Was curious since it does sometimes lead to me calling my cousins who are much older than me &quot;Em&quot; and my middle schooler cousins &quot;Anh&quot;, and I always found it a bit funny

 I need some advice, please. I will stay in Hanoi for one and a half days, and I want to do a one-day trip. However, I&#x27;m a bit hesitant about which option to choose:
 1) Halong Bay (Route 2)
 2) Ninh Binh (Hoa Lu, Trang An, Tam Coc, Hang Mua)
 3) Bai Dinh, Trang An, Mua Cave
 Thank you so much

Does anyone know of a forum to post or search for this type of thing? I would love to connect with him. We did try emailing him thru the 23 &amp; Me site but his profile hasn&#x27;t been active in a few weeks. His name is Kevin Nguyen. Any help would be great!

 Anyone has or knows these scenarios? Does it sound scammy to y’all or I’m overthinking 😂
 Edit: they have the same career: “shareholder of my aunt’s business. And none of them had verified profile

We have been asked for a picture by the owners for a pic of just us ( we thought maybe to put on their website or something like that ) but then also by someone in the bar who just wanted a selfie. This is our first time in Vietnam and just would like to know why. We dont care we laughed and also asked for a picture with them too just wanted some idea as to why. To preface we are very white with pale skin and from Liverpool which we did tell them- not sure if this is a reason but let us know if so !

 Seems like this is especially true in Saigon. Is it the pollution? The constant hustle of city life? The cigarette smoking? The beer consumption? Poor quality of food? 
 In phu quoc, I notice ppl look a bit younger and overall happier.

But they been meeting each other every weekend for like ever to sing karaoke and drink. This is just one prime examples of many I&#x27;ve encountered. If he is tired, then he should say he needs a time off.

                              <span>Something I have noticed during my time in Vietnam is that in many of the stores, restaurants etc you go into (generally the more expensive ones) the staff give the ‘hello sir’ and then just sort of stand right near you and watch, as you browse, as you decide, as you calculate cash for the bill etc. I’ve even had it where there are multiple workers stood looking at me. I find it incredibly off-putting and it usually just makes me want to leave immediately as I feel under pressure.
 Has anybody else noticed this phenomena? Is it normal?

                              <span>From my many years of travelling, visiting all of Southeast Asia except Laos and Myanmar, East Asia and India, it&#x27;s my first time an airport staff aggressively shouted at me. 
 After the Immigration, the guy who checks your passport and boarding pass in the final security check, alerted me that there&#x27;s an issue with my check-in baggage. He told me to wait in the waiting area. I was very nervous since it&#x27;s the first time that my baggage was questioned. And I kept thinking of worst case scenario like finding illegal items and being fined etc. I was waiting for a few minutes and asked politely (saying &quot;Sir&quot;) and he said that the staff from the airline is arriving. There&#x27;s no one at the security screening at that point and after several minutes, asked him politely again, and then he shouted in a loud aggressive voice &quot;I TOLD YOU TO WAIT HUH. WAIT!! &quot; and I was shocked by that aproach. Even his fellow staff looked at him. 
 I was shaken by his aggressive reply and just sat in my seat while he just turned his back at me. Fortunately, the airline staff arrived and accompanied me at the baggage screening. It was a pocket wifi and it&#x27;s carry on only. After clearing, I went to other side of security and went to boarding gates.
 (Also earlier, the lady at the check-in counter seems very testy, the way she processed the check-in procedures) 
 The staff at Saigon Airport seems to be in a lot of stress and not very friendly. I really had a bad experience on this Airport and it made a pretty bad impression as a visitor, , unlike the ones in Hanoi and Da Nang.. Honestly, from the attitude of staff and the whole airport experience (queueing, check-in), it&#x27;s much worse than the comparable NAIA (Manila) T3. Next time, I will choose Da Nang or Hanoi Airport.

                              <span>hi! am heading to Da Nang in a couple of days and want to surprise my partner for our anniversary by bringing them to a nice dinner at a restaurant in Da Nang.
 was hoping that i could perhaps get a nice list of dinner places that are a bit more romantic.
 we don’t have any cuisine preferences, but maybe not chinese food? (because we have a LOT of that from where we’re from haha)
 i’m a student, so my budget is about $40-50 usd for us both. 
 thanks so much in advance! :)

 I’m reading about Vietnamese History and I’m wondering if Crown Prince Nguyễn Phúc Bảo Long had a son before he died in 2007. If not, does this mean the royal family in exile no longer has a successor anymore? 
 Thank you very much. 🙏🙏🙏

                              <span>Hello all,
 Looking for some input and if I should remove or add any days anywhere in particular and if I&#x27;m missing something. I&#x27;m a medium paced traveller, don&#x27;t take things too slow but neither rush through the trip. 
 I&#x27;m into cozy hotels (not too expensive), historical sites &amp; museums, local food, drinks &amp; coffee places. I&#x27;m not a nightlife person and usually stay away from crazy spots - doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t like to visit and see them for a couple hours. I want to make the best out of my Vietnam trip. 
 I&#x27;m planning the following route in my Vietnam trip for so many days:
 Hanoi 4
 Ha Long Bay 2 (Here I plan a one night trip where they come pick you up from hotel and return you the next day - any agency you&#x27;d recommend? looking at prices online I expect around 350 euro pp)
 Ninh Binh 2 (Saw that can be done as a day trip but many people recommend spending the night)
 Sapa 3 (Here is the most uncertain part of the trip, not sure if worth spending the 6 hours of train/bus to reach here, stay 1 full day, and return the 3rd day - any experiences on how to proceed best?) 
 Hanoi 1 (coming back from Sapa and prepare for flight to Da Nang)
 Da Nang/Hue/Hoi An 5 (any idea how many days I should spend in each? I&#x27;m reading that Hoi An would be the best out of these 3 cities so I don&#x27;t mind cutting 1 city to spend more time in Hoi An) 
 HCMC 3 
 Phu quoc/ Con Dao 4 (I still have to decide which of the islands I should go to - price wise flight from HCMC is similar but I&#x27;m reading plenty of negative stuff on Phu Q so I&#x27;m leaning more towards Con Dao).

                              <span>As the title suggests, is there a sky bar or roof top bar in Saigon/Ho Chi Minh who takes reservations in advance? My friend and I wanted to book early on. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

 Em đang thấy mình như vậy. Em mới sinh em bé được vài tháng. Bố của em bé nói thẳng ra là một thằng hèn, không gửi phí sinh hoạt cho em bé từ lúc em bầu tới giờ, và cậu ta luôn trách móc em đủ thứ và cậu ta không ưa thái độ của em. Và từ lúc em bầu tới giờ cậu ta cũng chưa một lần hỏi thăm đến sức khoẻ của em chứ đừng nói là gửi phí sinh hoạt. Nhưng mà vấn đề chính k phải chuyện này, mở đầu câu chuyện em phải chì chiết sỉ vả thằng chó đó 1000 lần em mới vừa lòng, đó là thói quen của em mong mọi người thông cảm, em đang cố healing để bỏ chuyện đó ra khỏi đầu.

 Is that enough time for things to be delivered? How long does it usually take/which one is faster? Is there any way to find sellers from hcmc? Or are there places which can sell at similar prices in hcmc
 Sorry for way too many questions

                              <span>Xin Chao! Planning to bring my parents (in their 60s) to visit Vietnam for the very first time. I am trying to settle on which part to visit so looking to get people&#x27;s suggestions that fulfill the following: 
 ​
  
Somewhere scenic, my mom can take a thousand of pics 
 Some activities to do? Or even a tour in the area to learn about the cultures / history
 Food! We love food 
  
​
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: looking to visiting mid - end of Feb / early March!

 I am looking for some advice. I come from the UK and for Christmas I would like to get my partner a Vietnamese food themed hamper. He has absolutely fallen in love with the food and culture, so I wanted to get him something special for Christmas. So far in the hamper is a cookbook, personalised chopsticks, nuoc chan sauce. All these I can source quite easily in the UK. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Perhaps some traditional drinks or snacks? And if so, ideas of where I can buy them?
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>Hi! I am looking for a small village accessible by bus from Hanoi within 3 hours max that would have beautiful scenery, nice cooler weather and off the beaten path. I am open to more touristy options if they are really nice. I plan on doing a writing retreat and want as less distraction as possible, but would look forward for some nice mountain scenery or old village charm that i could easily stroll through on foot or bike. Thanks!

                              <span>Saw these signs all over North Vietnam in public restrooms in touristy places like Ha Long Bay, Ninh Binh, etc. Anyone know where I can buy some to bring back to the states? I&#x27;d love to put one up in the bathroom at my job 😄. I&#x27;m staying in Hanoi Old Quarter for 1 more day before I go back to HCMC, if anyone knows of any aluminum sign shops. Thanks!

                              <span>I’m in love with Da Nang, it’s beaches, it’s food - through pictures. I’ve also read about its amazing local and digital nomad community. 
 What would you say the weather is like from early December to early Jan in Da Nang? 
 Too wet and best to try another time? Or not too wet and it’s worth staying a month starting early December? 
 I’m keen to surf, spend time by the beach, walk by the beach.

 Which hotel would you recommend?

                              <span>I&#x27;m Việt Kiều and live in the west. I&#x27;ve noticed that most Vietnamese people have single syllable first names (Phuong, Linh, Huy, etc), but the few kids born here I&#x27;ve seen with two syllable first names, it starts with My, followed by another name - &quot;My ___&quot; For example: My Ha, My Tam, etc. I was wondering if this was a common type of name or sounded &#x27;natural&#x27; as I wanted to name some Vietnamese characters for something I&#x27;m writing.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m thinking about traveling to Vietnam in June. I come from an asian country that always uses a bidet and honestly I&#x27;m not comfortable using anything else.
 Is it the norm to use a bidet? Or is toilet paper a more common method? I was just wondering about the hotels and public washrooms. 
 If someone could help me out, i would really appreciate it.

                              <span>First question is about how much I should be spending on good street food. I just bought a banh Mỹ with chicken and egg for 55,000 from a little corner shop. Good deal?
 Second question is about protein drinks. In Thailand there was a 7 Eleven every few steps, and they all sold various protein drinks. The Circle K I just went into had none. How can I procure protein drinks without buying a huge tub?
 Thanks everyone!

                              <span>My friend told me that in Vietnam there&#x27;s a law where if you&#x27;re in a car accident and at-fault, you have to pay the hospital bills of the person you injured. So apparently when someone gets hit, the driver will often turn around and try to &quot;finish him/her off&quot; since it&#x27;s cheaper to pay for their funeral than all their medical expenses. 
 Is this true? Can someone link an article(s) where this actually took place. Sounds plausible yet comical.

                              <span>Cơ quan CSĐT (Công an TP.HCM) đã tống đạt quyết định khởi tố vụ án, khởi tố bị can và thi hành lệnh bắt tạm giam đối với nguyên phó khoa trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân vì mua dâm người dưới 18 tuổi.
 Một nguồn thông tin cho hay, Cơ quan CSĐT (Công an TP.HCM) vừa tống đạt các quyết định khởi tố vụ án, khởi tố bị can và thi hành lệnh bắt tạm giam đối với ông P.V.H. (47 tuổi, ngụ TP.Thủ Đức) về hành vi “Mua dâm người dưới 18 tuổi”.
 Các quyết định và lệnh trên đã được Viện KSND cùng cấp phê chuẩn.
 Ông P.V.H. đã bị tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân. Ông này từng mang cấp hàm Thượng tá, nguyên là phó khoa của trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân, trụ sở ở TP.HCM.
 Bước đầu, ông P. đã thừa nhận có hành vi mua bán dâm đối với bé gái 15 tuổi.
 Ngày 3/11, trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân đã có thông báo gửi đến công an các đơn vị, một số địa phương, học viện, trường, bệnh viện CAND về việc kỷ luật cán bộ. 
 Theo thông báo, vị phó khoa này bị kỷ luật bằng hình thức “tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân” từ ngày 1/11.
 Vụ án đang được Cơ quan CSĐT Công an TP.HCM mở rộng điều tra.

                              <span>Hi,
 We are flying out of Ho Chi Min on the 3rd of Jan late in the day so we were hoping to spend new years somewhere else, maybe Phu Quoc or does anyone have any other recommendations for South Vietnam? We don&#x27;t want to be stuck on the streets with millions of people so either a big beach style party or something really elegant maybe, a resort with events would work also but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything specific.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never been required to take one after being here some time. But a memo went out where I work that it would be required next year (I think nationally it already is, but whatever....) Anyway, my BMI is very low even for Vietnamese standards 44-45 kg at 170 cm. I&#x27;m a man. Otherwise healthy although I have had my blood pressure tested in the moderate to high zone at times, although other times it was normal. Not sure if I had nerves at the exam, but it has come out high in some exams. Not sure if I have any other issues. I can teach 12 hours straight if necessary, not sure why we need a confirmation of what can be seen, but what could get my visa not renewed? Thanks!

 Do you have any advice for someone coming here for the first time? Such as things not to do, things to watch out for, or if I need to get to the airport earlier?

 Received a pen made by him (or has his brand at least) as a gift and it is really nice. I would like to study and purchase more lacquer products while I am in Vietnam next week. 
 Also if there is any other recommendations regarding son mai, I&#x27;m all ears. Really looking for the good stuff though, not street knock offs.

I don&#x27;t know exactly how impactful is the recession on the lives of most people, but I heard some ppl say it is probably worse than on TV because there&#x27;s more job layoffs. Just curious, how impactful is it ?

                              <span>Yesterday I received a call informing me that the train I was traveling on SP3 had been cancelled, and my ticket would now be changed to SP1. I also received a text message, and I had no suspicion at the time.
 Just now, someone called me and asked me where I was. He said he would meet me at the Hanoi station and put me on the train. I thought to myself: The service of Vietnam Railway is really good.
 After I entered Hanoi Station, I found that the sp3 train had not been cancelled. There were many people in the train, and I could tell at a glance that they were also tourists. At the same time, I saw the person who called me. He was wearing a &quot;xx travel&quot; T-shirt but not the blue uniform of the Vietnam Railway . He put me on the train and told me he was sorry. I think I roughly understood it, and I didn&#x27;t expose him. I didn&#x27;t suffer any loss, and I knew that he was just an ordinary office worker who just wanted to complete his work.
 I guess maybe more people joined the tour group, but they didn’t have enough train tickets, so they randomly selected a few lucky passengers like us and lied to them. This should be something that tour groups operate and Vietnam Railways acquiesces to.

                              <span>I’ve only ever been to Phu Quoc twice and both times I am convinced I flew later in the evening, around 9pm the first time and then 11pm the next. Getting the later flights allowed me to return home from work to collect luggage and then be on the island in good time. 
 However more recently I wanted to go back and found myself completely unable to find any flight that flies after 6.45pm. I checked multiple airlines, even seeing if booking a month or two made any difference. I couldn’t find anything. 
 Anyone got any idea what the hell is happening?

                              <span>Why the fuck do people need to scream and yell and setup the most loud annoying sound systems to do Karaoke in neighborhoods. It used to stop by 10 but recently it never ends.
 Go to a karaoke room, shut it down by 10.
 It always happens to be the worst fucking singers in history.
 Sorry Vietnam you need to break this fucking shit culture asap. I have never hated something from this country more. Or any country for that matter.
 Singing the shittiest wannabe country/folk/traditional bullshit ever. Thinking theyre Celine Deon or some shit. 
 This damn family has been singing the same bullshit drunk for hours, its taking everything i have not to go start yelling at them. Now they have people come over and play their instruments also and they are horrible beyond horrible 
 If i was a Viet I dont think i could hold back on them

                              <span>I’m currently in hcmc and it’s my first week in Vietnam so excuse my lack of cultural wit.
 Today I was trying to park my bike and a random looking guy showed up. He started scribbling something on a piece of paper so I assumed he wanted to charge me for the parking. I told him to show me some kind of ID but he wouldn’t so I told him to get lost and just left the bike there. On my way back I realised he’s moved the bike to the middle of the road. I’ve got a few questions:
  
Do these people charge money for parking?
 
If so, on what basis? Like, do they own the parking spaces?
 
If they do charge, do I just trust any random looking dude here and hand them in my money?
 
What is his job exactly, how does anyone benefit from his services?
 
 Also I do apologise if I just broke some social standards. The only similar experience I’ve had was in Naples where local drug addicts demand money for parking, and I’ve been advised by my Italian friend to just ignore them. I would really like to know how to deal with this here in Vietnam.

                              <span>As someone from the Philippines, I know that the sub has some strong opinions for Korean, Chinese and Indian tourists. So, it made me think, what do the Vietnamese thinks of fellow SEasians? In my 8 days in Vietnam, I only noticed a handful of them. Most are Koreans and Indians. 
 As a Filipino, I was surprised that we&#x27;re the biggest spenders in Vietnam. I was also mistaken for a Thai a lot. It seems that Thai tourists frequent Vietnam.

                              <span>I think you guys could relate to this.
 Growing we’ve all probably heard some variation of this. Where your parents would stop you from misbehaving by saying “oh if you don’t do this, a cop will arrest you” or “if you don’t stop doing this, that man over there will kidnapped you”.
 I thought that that kind of parenting was something that is long gone by time our generation came around. 
 But lo and behold, just this evening while I was enjoying a drink a mother near me was trying to get her daughter to eat. Now I wasn’t paying attention because it wasn’t my business… until the mother looks over at me and said “if you don’t eat that man will kidnapped you”. I was the only other customer there so I knew for a fact she was talking about me.
 And I just… didn’t know what to do or say, I just look over at them surprise for a few second while she continue, saying how I’m gonna do it and where I’ll take her
 I paid and left pretty quickly after that but how do you responded to something like that? WHY are we still doing something like that?!

                              <span>As of October 31, 2023. Prime Video became unavailable to Vietnam users. Refund will be sent to subscribers. 
  
&quot;Unplugging Prime Video: The What and The Why Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming arm, has been a part of Vietnam’s digital entertainment spectrum since 2016. The service, akin to Netflix, brought a plethora of international films and TV shows to Vietnamese screens. But come October 2023, active subscriptions will be cancelled, and full refunds will be issued. Additionally, Prime Gaming benefits will also become inaccessible.
  
While Amazon remains silent on the rationale behind this closure, industry insiders speculate Vietnamese regulations may hold the key. The country mandates transnational paid broadcasting services to obtain licenses—a hurdle that Amazon seems unwilling to surmount. However, this is merely conjecture in the absence of an official explanation.&quot;

 I took the train from Saigon to Nam Dinh. When I arrived in Da Nang, the song &quot;Đà Nẵng trong tim tôi&quot; was played on the train. So what song will be played on the train when I arrive in Hanoi or Saigon?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I’m on cat ba island from 16th until 20th and I need a strong and secure WiFi connection to try and get tickets to a festival that usually sells out very quickly (Glastonbury festival). 
 It looks like the hostel we are staying in has poor WiFi, so does anyone know the best spots for strong WiFi on the island? Any good hotels or internet cafes? We’re thinking of checking into an Airbnb with private WiFi on the final night just to see if it’ll help our chances of getting a ticket. 
 Any advice welcome! Thank you.

 I have emailed 19001166@bambooairways.com and it wasn&#x27;t even replying at all.
 Anyone facing the same issue?
 I&#x27;m in Saigon but their head office is permanently closed. I&#x27;m left with no other options at all.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m a European guy who recently travelled in Vietnam for a month.
 On one day I decided to travel on my motorbike to a nearby town that wasn&#x27;t touristy at all, because I wanted to see more of the real Vietnamese life.
 I ended up sitting in a cafe with a Vietnamese stranger. We drank coffee, smoked, talked through translate and had fun. I&#x27;m 19, he&#x27;s 27 with a young child if that matters.
 We ended up meeting again, travelling around and he showed me some sights. At the end of the day he insisted I slept at his house. Here I sat with him and his younger brother, we talked and eventually I went to sleep.
 Next day, I have to leave early to book a bus. My Vietnamese friend/host also had to leave early. When I was about to leave I saw a woman and I asked him if that&#x27;s his mom. He said yes.
 I told him I wanted to go thank her for letting me stay at her house. He declined. I insisted. He declined again, he seemed to really not want me to do that.
 His mom, who seemed to me doing some chores, didn&#x27;t acknowledge me at all, not even look at me.
 I found this super weird. Why was this the case?
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is a personal thing or could have to do with Vietnamese culture. Maybe I did something wrong. If it has to do with culture, do you know why this happened?

                              <span>Hello Vietnamese friends, I am from New Delhi India and I visited Vietnam for the first time, this was my second international trip and it changed the way I look at life. I stayed 2 nights in Ha-long bay and four nights in Hanoi old quarter. The people of your country are some of the warmest people I have met in my life, your roads are so clean, and even though you feel you will be run over people coolly navigate around you. No one is rude to you on the other hand I was helped by locals from falling into a tourist trap, every country had good and bad people. The majority of your country had great people with big hearts. You don’t disrespect neither do you have a demeanor where someone can try to undermine or disrespect you, maybe the years of war and made you so strong yet so humble. Money is the basis of all economies yet in your country, majority folk don’t give it the importance it’s given the world over. Food was so fresh and the amount of fruits you eat and the fresh seafood shows on your flawless skins. The women take the cake in hard work and yet manage to look so elegant in whatever they wear, they are such boss ladies it’s commendable. There are other countries in South Asia which have built economies on sex work, yet yours keeps its head held high and aims to give a more wholesome experience to any visitor.
 I write this from my bed in India, sad and depressed at having come back from such a lovely country which I wish was like my second home!
 Thank you Vietnam 🇻🇳 🙏🏻

Tớ suy nghĩ nghe bài hát Việt Nam một cách hiệu quả để cải thiện tiếng việt của tớ. Tớ thường thích nghe Rock, Jazz hay Rock Pop. Tớ đặc biệt thích &quot;City Pop&quot;, một loại nhạc Nhật. Tớ muốn hỏi các bạn thể giới thiệu cho tớ một số ban nhạc Việt Nam giống kiểu Rock, Jazz hay City Pop, nhưng nhạc Việt Nam nà cũng được. (xin lỗi nếu Post này có nhiều lỗi, tớ chưa học tiếng Việt lâu :)))

                              <span>Yoshitaka Shindo&#x27;s local company built a new building in 2017 for Vietnamese technical interns, with an average bedroom size of 3.1 m2 per person. It was pointed out that this building did not meet JITCO regulations even before it was built, but this company stated that this was not a problem because Vietnamese people live in worse conditions in their home countries. But the regulation that the minimum bedroom size per person should be 4.5 m2 on average was established. In response to this issue this company made a donation of 4 million to Yoshitaka Shindo. As a result, this rule was changed and the aforementioned building is no longer in violation.
 This is a deepl translation of my summary of the article below.

                              <span>I never like taking taxis anyway, I usually use Grab but my mom is a little more old-fashioned so whenever I’m traveling with her at the Tan Son Nhat airport she insists on using a taxi. She is Native Viet and I am Việt kiều. 
 First time, they scammed us to pay double/triple a normal fare price (and I know taxis to and from airport are already higher end, so it was double that price already). 
 Second time I gave them the hotel address, which was a chain hotel. Dude didn’t want to drive across town and said this particular chain accepts any reservation at any of their locations so he dropped us off at the hotel chain spot close to the hotel. I was already suspicious when he said this, but my mom accepted it readily and didn’t argue. She’s been living in Vietnam for over two years now for retirement and also grew up here, so if she thought it was fine I wasn’t going to argue either, especially since I was exhausted from a long flight. Obviously it turned out not to be true and the hotel receptionist said as much and called us a cab to our actual hotel reservation. 
 Even after these two incidents my mom still goes to the taxis when leaving the airport as she says there are no other options. However, to book a Grab car to pickup from airport you just have to walk to the airport parking lot and they’ll pick you up from there. She struggles with technology and apps though and still feels more comfortable using the taxis even knowing they’re overpriced and scammy. But for anyone who’s comfortable with using apps and booking a Grab, go for that option. Teach the older folk how to use it too. These taxis are atrocious.

 I know there’s lots of similar gates in Hanoi but does anyone know this specific one? I’ve tried reverse image searching but the descriptions are all a bit vague. Thanks!

                              <span>As a Viet, having been traveled to many countries, I have never experienced anything as unprofessional and exudes as bad energy as this place. It’s one the greatest embarrassment this country has to offer. Custom and Border officers truly brought great shame. One dude looks like he’s day drunk, the other officer cleared 3-4 people while he cleared only one. Elderly people and crying babies standing in line for hours. Every officers look visibly pissed off. What a great way to welcome foreigners to our country. This officer got my blood boiling when he physically push a Japanese tourist back in line, the tourist was simply chatting with his group because they have to wait 2 hours in line. He later show extreme irritation to the dude, slam his passport on the table in a rude manner. The Japanese tourist was in shock. Godd!!! It pissed me off everytime I land in this god forsaken ass place. Not to mention getting a taxi out of the airport. It’s extremely chaotic, unorganized, and everything is in disorder with no clear direction. Im amazed people still visit this country. Because that is some of the shittiest welcome any country could ever give.

                              <span>So I’ve noticed that certain Vietnamese folks around me just really hates Indian folks for whatever reason? My mother and some of my co-worker shows disdain towards them for whatever reason? When I probed my mom about it, the reason she stated for hating Indians is that they’re “stinky” and that “they are all thieves”, which I kinda don’t buy that line of reasoning. Anyone else experience similar things or do I just happen to live around particularly racists folks?
 Edit: thank you all for the replies, reading them was very…. enlightening. Needless to say, I think I’ve been rather naive with my ways of thinking thus far, thank you all for informing me.

I gave her flowers on 10-20, and we&#x27;re affectionate in public, and when it’s just the two of us but when I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said she wants to see where our relationship is headed. I&#x27;m really confused after everything we&#x27;ve shared. Should I run for the door?

                              <span>EDIT: I am leaving. Perhaps with a different company, or if there were a different demographic of people in my tour group, I would have stuck it out, but my gut is telling me to leave. Some odd things have happened that are not just related to the party culture. These people are racist. Guys, always trust your gut.
 Hi all, I (20F, poc) scheduled a Ha Giang easy rider loop tour through a hostel after all the rave reviews online. I arrive, and quickly realize that this is all just one big excuse for young white European people to drink and party. I felt extremely uncomfortable my first night here, before the tour starts, as I did not come to Vietnam to drink with strangers, don’t like these people in my group, and am uninterested in the tourist drinking and partying scene. I don’t know why I didn’t do better research to see what a terrible tourist trap Ha Giang has become. I wanted a beautiful nature motorbike tour, but I am thinking of canceling because I don’t want to drink and don’t want to be the only person of color in the group, already half-excluded.
 Has anyone felt the same way when visiting Southeast Asia, and how did you avoid this? I’m here to travel solo, decompress, enjoy nature and different cities and locals, not interested in making friends with other tourists.
 And now, I’m not sure what to do. Is the loop still worth it if I don’t want to party at night and just feel uncomfortable with the people in my group? I’m thinking of just bailing and going back to Hanoi, which I loved.

 Also is there anywhere i can go to get shirts of local clubs? 
 Thanks to anyone who reply!

                              <span>Hi I am an American born Indian who is travelling to Vietnam soon. I know nothing about Vietnam other than that Pho and Bun Bo Hue taste good, and of course Vietnamese coffee and Banh Mi are popular here. I&#x27;m a huge foodie, but I also want to know of some must see destinations there. I&#x27;m staying for a period of 3 months, so please let me know all there is to see. I&#x27;ll probably be in Hanoi for my 22nd birthday. Thank you!

                              <span>Does anyone have experience getting sertraline from a pharmacy or doctor? If so, what did it cost? I’m a foreigner and have a prescription from outside Vietnam. It appears easy to get here but the two pharmacies I asked quoted almost 20,000 per 50 mg pill, which is very high.

                              <span>Hello!! My husband and I are traveling to Vietnam for the first time, specifically to Hanoi, during the first few days in December.
 How is the weather in Hanoi typically during this time of year? We are from New York City so we see all types of weather.
 Will it be cold and rainy? Or mild temps? We are going to Hong Kong after so we are trying to gauge what and how to pack.
 Thank you!

 Hôm nay tôi đáp máy bay đến Hà Nội quá giờ trưa với cái bụng đói cồn cào. Tôi nhờ tài xế chở đến một quán bún chả ngon. Và anh ấy đưa tôi đến quán có tên là Đắc Kim, tôi thấy quán có treo bảng hiệu lớn là lọt top Michelin Guide vừa rồi. Tôi hào hứng dùng thử và đúng là hương vị rất ngon.
 Tôi ngồi ngay đối diện chủ quán và nhìn mọi người chuẩn bị các nguyên liệu. Giữa tầm mắt của tôi và chủ quán là một cô lớn tuổi, tóc bạc, tôi nghĩ cũng gần 70. Khi đó tôi đang đưa máy lên để quay lại cảnh mọi người thao tác, vì tôi vốn rất thích nhìn những người lớn tuổi mà vẫn hăng say làm việc. Giữa chừng thì tôi bất giác nghe thấy người chủ quán la hét vào mặt của người làm công lớn tuổi đó bằng những lời lẽ mà tôi tưởng tượng chỉ có trong phim ảnh Việt Nam th…</span>

                              <span>I am planning to solo travel to Vietnam and Thailand in early April 2024 for a few weeks and am looking to hire a local tour guide to accompany and show me Vietnam’s nightlife. I know I can hire private local tour guides from places like GetYourGuide, but they seem more tailored towards sightseeing and day tours. I am specifically looking to explore the nightclubs and KTVs of Vietnam (mainly Ho Chi Minh). Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>We’ve all heard of those family feuds over property, right? Well me and my mom thought about it and we’d like to avoid just that in the future. 
 Backstory: my mom is Vietnamese but lives in Sweden. Her brother is holding either half (or on the contract, currently holding) her house for her until she retires and moves there in the future. Now grown up and having seen my family members patterns, I’m almost too sure that a conflict will arise in the future from this. Mainly between my moms brother, and his wife. The two aren’t too fond of each other. Another red flag I noticed during a trip to VN one summer was that my uncle started tearing up and making a whole scene in front of everyone when my mom just calmly asked for her name to also be included on the papers for the house. He was screaming about being accused of being greedy when no one approached it that way. I felt like he was scared and projecting. 
 Any advice is appreciated. I’d hate to see my family members fight over four walls in the future. 
 PS. This property was gifted to specifically my mom from her parents. My grandparents made sure each one of their kids got a retirement property.

                              <span>Hello! I have a question. I work at a garment factory in Vietnam. How can I retail my products to customers in the United States? My products include khaki pants, dress shirts, and more. I have looked into Amazon, but I noticed that they already sell similar basic items directly, and their fees seem quite high, around 40%. Can anyone provide me with some suggestions?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t assume a rational explanation for this question exists, but why are there so many adults who ride around on their motorcycles while their child is sitting on the back with their head exposed to the whatever could happen on these mean streets of VN. 
 Parents &quot;protect&quot; their own heads but not their own childrens. Yesterday during a massive downpour of rain, a father sat comfortably in his helmet and raincoat while his daughter sat on the back, cold, wet and at risk of head injury should they crash.
 At least for me, if there is only one helmet, my passenger gets it. 
 if there is one raincoat and we can&#x27;t share, my passenger gets it. 
 I honestly can&#x27;t imagine a world where you love your children but won&#x27;t sacrifice a helmet or raincoat for them.

 Side question: is it a good time to buy farm land now? if not, when should I look out for better prices? pre-tet? 
 context: yes im a foreigner but my viet wife gonna do the buying and paperwork. purchase of farmland is not for making money but to convert it to personal use

She is a bit unfamiliar with food allergies because they aren&#x27;t that common there I have found out. Does anyone have any tips or specific restaurants that can handle nut and shellfish allergies? I should not that I am not allergic to fish sauce or peanuts, specifically shellfish and tree nuts.

                              <span>Where is the best place to play pick up basketball in Ho Chi Minh City?
 I&#x27;ve tried Phu Tho in District 10 and it was great the 1st time but then the 2nd time some lady said I had to rent it out just to shoot around on a court that was empty and dark with no lighting. 
 There&#x27;s another court called Seventy Seven and that one was pretty cool but it looked more of a &quot;friends getting together and pitching in to play&quot; type of deal. It didn&#x27;t have a very &quot;pick up&quot; style feel to it at all. 
 There is a gymnasium in District 3 and you need to rent that one out as well. Apparently, the Ho Chi Minh City Wings play at this location. 
 I haven&#x27;t even looked at District 1 yet, but I&#x27;m starting to kind of feel you need to rent a whole court out to get anything going.
 Maybe we can get a group going of at least 10 of us getting together to rent a court out together. I&#x27;m just trying to run 5 vs 5 for an hour or so to get a good work out in. 
 I&#x27;m going to try Phu Tho again because today might have just been a wierd off day as last time I was there, it actually felt like a normal park where people just rolled up and started playing pick up.
 I know basketball is not very big in Vietnam but for a developing city with 9 million people in it, I expected more out of the basketball community.

                              <span>For context, I randomly saw a video (fb) inwhich a guy (called Bino) was shocked when he saw a customer make $21k monthly. And here go the comments.
 The first one: &quot;it is normal in America for ppl to makes 6 figures annually&quot;
 The second one: &quot;my ex make $100k monthly&quot; lol wtf
 From what I&#x27;ve heard, the medium-high salary for a Vietnamese person and an American are $1000 and $4000, respectively, but I might be wrong. I just curious what the average income in Vietnam and in big cities (in Vietnam) is.

Paypal and payoneer is a no since they are too unreliable and the fee is horrendous.

                              <span>I share the same sentiment. And I was born and raised in Vietnam. Every once in a while you run into someone who’s kinda old, but not that old, and you don’t know if you should call them anh or chú. 
 Same with the women: idk if they’re old enough for me to call them cô or chị without offending them
 Edit: Just remembered something else about pronouns so figured I’ll blow y’all mind. 
 Within the family tree of Vietnam, you call your cousins anh/chị/em, not based on age but based on your parents age. In other words, if my father has a younger brother, and they both have children, my uncle’s kid would have to call me anh/chị regardless of age. This means it is possible that I am anh/chị even if I’m the younger cousin!!
 Another thing is if within a family tree, a person is on the same generation as your parents, you call them cô/dì/chú/bác. So for a large family with 1st generation of 5, it is possible to have some people of the 2nd generation younger than some people in the 3rd generation!! But the people in the 3rd generation still have to call the 2nd gen people cô dì chú bác cậu mợ, regardless of age

                              <span>My partner and I have booked flights from Brisbane to Vietnam with vietjet, and we made the mistake of leaving our middle names out of our flight bookings. First and last names match our passports exactly, the difference is only our middle names. Does anyone know if this is will be a problem? We&#x27;ve seen some people say online that it will be fine, and others say that vietjet likes to make customers rebook their tickets for the slightest error. Thanks!

                              <span>In Vietnam, a traveler bold and true,
 Found happiness for a part we seldom knew,
 Amidst lush landscapes and cultures so grand,
 His Anus danced with joy in this distant land.
 Bidets and bum guns, a revelation sweet,
 Made cleanliness a daily, pleasant treat,
 No more rough paper, it was all so clean,
 In Vietnam, his rear was like a gleam.
 But fate can twist a traveler&#x27;s joy to pain,
 As food, exotic, brought discomfort&#x27;s reign,
 A dodgy dish, it left him in despair,
 And his happy Anus turned grumpy with a glare.
 In moments of delight and sudden strife,
 A traveler&#x27;s tale unfolds in life,
 From happiness to grump, a twist so stark,
 In Vietnam, his Anus found a journey marked.

                              <span>I&#x27;m potentially moving to District 1 in HCMC, depending on the work visa stuff. I should be getting a little bit higher salary, but the condos seem so much more expensive that it might not even make sense.
 I&#x27;m looking around at condos just through google search (DotProperty, RentApartmentVN, etc) and I haven&#x27;t seen anything for less than $390. Or around 10 million VND. These condos look like normal condos, with no furniture and maybe a swimming pool. In Bangkok I&#x27;ve got a normal condo, that came with furniture and swimming pool and gym for $280/month.
 It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that HCMC is that much more expensive than BKK but I really don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve seen people here say with $300 you could rent a mansion, but I&#x27;m not seeing anything like that all, not do I want a mansion. Just a 1 bedroom studio with a pool or gym or some kind of recreational thing to do at the condo, or in the area for around $300 USD, maybe around 8M VND, is that&#x27;s reasonable. 
 Is HCMC really that much more expensive in terms of renting a condo? Or am I just looking in the wrong places?

                              <span>I&#x27;m taking a Vietnamese class in the US and my teacher said that for 3rd person pronouns we can use &quot;đó&quot; instead of &quot;ấy.&quot; As in &quot;cô đó mua xe hơi&quot; translating to &quot;she buys a car,&quot; and &quot;anh đó có phải là kỹ sư không?&quot; translating to &quot;is he an engineer?&quot;. She said &quot;cô đó&quot; would be used more in the south than &quot;cô ấy&quot; as a 3rd person pronoun. 
 I was wondering if this is correct or maybe I am misunderstanding her explanation? (Her English is a bit difficult to understand sometimes.)
 For some background info, my teacher is in her late 60s and moved to the US in her 20s from central/southern Viet Nam. She is trying to teach the southern accent/dialect, but our textbook is Northern so it is confusing sometimes. 
 TLDR: Is &quot;cô đó&quot; the southern equivalent of &quot;cô ấy&quot; as a 3rd person pronoun?

                              <span>Xin chao! I’m a Singaporean and I would like to ride my Singapore-registered motorcycle (Yamaha R15 V3) into the beautiful country of Vietnam. 
 I have ridden my R15 through Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and into the border town of Myanmar before and I would love to visit Vietnam (HCMC to Hanoi) via Cambodia before exiting into Laos and back into Thailand. 
 Does anyone know if this is possible, and if so, how I can go about it? Thank you!

                              <span>Just a question I&#x27;m curious about. I heard that doctors leaves a hospital to run their own clinic out of their own family house by themselves and earn only slightly better than what they usually get at hospitals.
 I thought doctors are generally paid really well. I&#x27;m trying to get an idea of how their pay would compare with a normal working person in vn.
 Do doctors usually have a decent salary/earning in Vietnam?

                              <span>Travelling to HCMC end of December with 5 nights at a nice resort on Phu Quoc in the middle. Trying to decide between JW Marriott or Regent. Has anyone stayed at both and can advise. We’re a couple, no kids, in our 40’s. Plan is 50/50 relax / explore.

                              <span>Growing up I would hear this song at the end of Vietnamese events in Canada. We&#x27;re southern Vietnamese if it helps. 
 It sounds very much like a marching band kind of song. 
 It goes &quot;vietnam Vietnam da da da da&quot;. The da da da da are the words I don&#x27;t know. 
 Lol that&#x27;s all I got man. I know it&#x27;s a long shot.

                              <span>Hi all! We’ll be visiting Ha long city for just an overnight and we’ll be staying around the Quang Ninh area near the Tuan Chau bridge, aside from taking a ferry to Cat Ba Island though will only probably do it for a nice view of the ocean and bay and then be back again to the town since we can’t ride a motorbike to explore the island. What else can we do around the town? Is there any cool cafes there? :) 
 also, will probably just chill at the beach admiring the view haha

                              <span>Hi all, I am a student in 2nd year at a university in Vietnam and I am hoping to qualify for exchange study in Osnabruck, Germany from February to July 2024.
 I want to ask those who had a chance to study abroad for such amount of time and/or live in Germany: Does it worth it? Can it really change yourself a whole lot, in terms of thinking, studying, relationships, etc? Can this experience somehow be helpful for some of my future plans like looking for Masters scholarships abroad or working in an international environment?

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s at least partially true. But what are the specifics of this regulation? And what is the justification given for it? (Presumably it originated in wartime, fear of recruitment by foreign powers, etc., but does this still convince in 2023?)
 Given that there are at least 2 million people belonging to either the military or the police, don&#x27;t they ever think &#x27;man, why can&#x27;t I at least go to Thailand for a fun weekend&#x27;?
 [edit to summarize some good answers: it seems not to be forbidden per se, but can require very lengthy and annoying paperwork.]

                              <span>I&#x27;m a high school student, currently 12th grade.
 I have been struggling with school ever since 7th grade, and as far as it seems, it is only getting worse over time.
 I believe that I may have ADHD, or something of sort related to mentality. But I cannot confirm yet without a proper doctor checkup.
 I am too afraid to talk with my parents about it, as they are very keen on education, and I am scared that they would constantly scold me and make it worse if I were to talk to them about it.
 Right now, I don&#x27;t have any motivation to continue school. The first mid-semester exam is coming and I cannot focus on a single thing for even a second.
 What can I do to help myself? Or what should I do to make my parents be understanding about my situation, and potentially do something about it?
 Any help will be appreciated.

 Question on my learning VN 
 If I ask a question I put “phải không” at the end of it. 
 While learning I found that its not necessary to use phải and you can use không? When should I be using không versus phải không when learning Vietnamese when asking a question. 
 Examples:
 Lily muốn pho phai khong? Does Lily want noodles?
 Lily muốn pho khong? 
 Does the above still work?

                              <span>I visited Ha Noi last January and liked it so much I’m returning for a month starting mid-December. It could be longer as I have the 3 month visa. I’ve seen the sights including Ha Long Bay. I’m looking for suggestions on other things to do in the city. I’ll head out of town for Sa Pa and Ninh Binh. Not sure about Ha Giang loop as I’ll be alone. I’m sticking to the north this trip though possibly a few days in Da Nang. I have a couple friends there but will be on my own very often. I’m an older (60s), gay male.

                              <span>Hi, I am việt kiều in Eastern Europe. My dad’s Vietnamese and my mom is Eastern European.
 A year ago, I relocated to Vietnam to work in my dad’s company. I met this Vietnamese guy in the business meeting of my dad. Both of us are into each other. Although I look more like a Slavic person, I am always more attracted to Vietnamese people. He’s literally my type. I still have to travel between my mom’s country and Vietnam, and he’s busy, so we only see each other twice per month. Everytime we met, he still bought gifts for me. I also gave something back to him.
 I told him I consider buying a car , because I’ld settle down here in Hanoi. Then, two weeks later, a new Mercedes was sent to my apartment . Now, I have no idea how to buy something back to him. That Mercedes is worth over 2 billions VND. I don’t have billions to spend on a gift. 
 My dad always teaches me “never take anything for free in Vietnam”. I can’t ask my dad for much money though. We are just dating, and I am not his wife. It’s weird for me to receive a big gift like that. Luckily, I don’t live with my dad’s family. They haven’t know about this car yet.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 So I&#x27;m pretty stoked I get to go back to Vietnam I haven&#x27;t been on an international flight since pre covid! 
 Last time I was there I injured myself and couldn&#x27;t do the loop, however since I&#x27;m taking my girlfriend and it&#x27;s her first time there the loop is my number 1 priority! Plus it&#x27;ll be my 30th bday! 
 So my question is, where can I book that you&#x27;d recommend? She wants to use an easy rider I want to ride my own bike. I cant find any option to choose an easy rider or not online. So where can I do this? 
 Lastly what is needed for the loop? We have our health insurance that would cover leisure etc. Is there anything else? 
 Thanks in advance everyone!

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am planning to take a 10 days trip to Vietnam
 plan is to visit like this:
 Hanoi - 1.5 days, Da Nang - 1 day, Hoi An - 2 days, Hue - 1 day, Phong Nha (cave trek) - 1 day, Ninh Binh - 2 days, Sapa - 2 days,
 Total : 11 days mostly 
 do you think this is a good plan ? 
 i have never travelled to Vietnam before
 what things i need to know before travelling to Vietnam ? 
 are there any other cities which i should choose instead of the ones i have chosen in my list? 
 thanks in advance to all of you for giving your precious time in reading this post :)

                              <span>Sorry if my question is phrased wrongly, but I do not know how to phrase it better. As a westerner (or in this case, a person born from Vietnamese parents, but raised in the US), I never really engaged with the Vietnamese language and many of its cultural products (other than the food, but that is a given). 
 I never really watch any Vietnamese shows or musics because it looked poorly made compared with other things, like American/Western sitcoms and anime. And looking at the posts on this subreddit, I see that the younger generation of Vietnam is also seem to take more interest in K-Pop, Anime, and other cultural media than their home media. So in that case, why should I take time to learn Vietnamese to engage with the media that even the younger generation seems to not take interest in? 
 I know this question sounds superficial (and it is) and there are many reasons to learn Vietnamese (talk to relatives and the people of Vietnam, learn the ethmology/history of the language, just have knowledge of Vietnamese under your belt, etc. ), but many times the reason why a person learns about a culture and the language of that culture is because they engage with something in the culture that sparks them to learn more about the culture. But I do not see that spark personally. Vietnamese is not the spoken language in the world (meaning it is not really a global business language), doesn&#x27;t really have a huge art/film scene, and vietnamese culture in general does not really spark a huge influence across the globe. So why should I learn Vietnamese?

                              <span>My gf and I travelled for 3 weeks in Vietnam. We started in Sapa and ended our journey in the south to take a ferry to Phnom Penh. Vietnam is the most fantastic country! The people &#x27;re so nice and helpful. They made my day. The nature ... just wow! Can&#x27;t discribe it, you have to see and feel it. I wish every Vietnamese all the best and the brightest future. The country Vietnam and there people will always have a special place in my heart. Thank you!

                              <span>The Dragon also represents the emperor in China. A lot of Vietnamese mythological creatures are not distinctly Vietnamese. Are there any traditional royal and national symbols that Vietnam doesn&#x27;t share with East Asia? Only Nghê and Lạc bird come to mind so far but they don&#x27;t symbolize Vietnam as well as the dragon.
 Imagine if you are creating a new national flag or national emblem for Vietnam with more traditional elements, how do you make it so that it won&#x27;t be confused with Chinese symbols?

                              <span>Have a 3 week trip to Vietnam planned with my friend. I have been to Vietnam before, but only to Hanoi, Ha Long and Ninh Binh. This is my friend’s first time.
 Main Worries: - Is there anything I’ve missed that I should include like Dalat or Hue? 
  
Is going to Ha Giang after Ninh Binh repetitive? We are planning to motorbike in both places, but I am debating cutting out the 3 day Ninh Binh leg as both might be too similar
  
Thanks! 
 Hanoi - 3 Days
 Ning Binh (including Tam Coc and Trang An) - 3 Days
 Ha Giang Loop - 3/4 days
 Da Nang and Hoi An - 4/5 Days
 Phong Nha Cave Trekking - 3 Days with Oxalis
 HCMC - 2 Days

                              <span>Hello, my partner booked a flight to Singapore from Ho chi Minh and we are trying to change the flight dates a family member has fallen ill. 
 When we tried to change the dates this was not allowed on the website and we contacted costumer support. Unfortunately they told us we couldn&#x27;t change the dates as we had &quot;booked&quot; our flights through an agency, which is not the case. We have an email confirming our booking through Vietnam airlines only. 
 They told us the name agency apparently being Aberdeen (with that being the only name they had) and that was it. We asked if they could forward us the confirmation they had on their side from such agency and they said they couldn&#x27;t do that because it was with another department. We tried googling such agency and nothing comes up and again we don&#x27;t have the confirmation from such agency either. We tried to argue we have not booked through an agency and again she refused to help us as she said we had booked through this so called agency that does not exist. 
 We are 100% sure we booked with Vietnam airlines and we don&#x27;t know what to do now. We have contacted the other department she mentioned but there&#x27;s only an email we could contact. 
 It feels like we are being scammed by the airline and not being helped. 
 Has anyone had this issue before?
 Update: We were able to change it through this new email we received. Someone in the comments mentioned there&#x27;s an Aberdeen based Vietnam airlines which would make sense for why this happened. They are trying to charge us the equivalent of a new flight now though... So we are going to book with another airline. Good luck to whomever is having this issue in the future

                              <span>em mình là con gái, tóc nó xoăn và phồng. Từ nhỏ đến lớn, có nhiều người kêu nó đi duỗi tóc. Nhưng gia đình mình vẫn yêu tóc đó của nó, thật lòng, nên nó cũng tin vào vẻ đẹp của chính mình như vậy.
 Nhưng đêm qua nó kể mình nghe, trong lòng nó vẫn chưa nguôi uất ức. Nó bị mấy thằng bạn chọc là chó lông xù, đừng chọc nó, nó cắn giờ.
 Mình hỏi rồi em làm thế nào, nó trả lời em im vì đáp trả là tụi nó chọc tới.
 Có ai bảo vệ em không? Không, mà có một lúc có đứa con gái định lên tiếng chọc nhưng có đứa khác ngăn lại.
 Xoã tóc - một hành động hết sức bình thường. Nhưng dưới tác động của bạo lực ngôn từ, hành động xoã tóc lại trở nên khó khăn với em mình hơn bao giờ hết. Nó không muốn xoã tóc đi học nữa, vì sợ bị bạn chọc. Cũng có lúc, từ việc yêu mái tóc xoăn xù tự nhiên, nó chán ghét và muốn duỗi thẳng tóc mình. Đó cũng là lí do em mình muốn lên chuyên, một môi trường khác vì “ở đó không ai nói, ko chê cũng ko khen mái tóc của em, nhưng ít nhất là không chê”. Cho nên em thoải mái xoã tóc khi đi ôn ở chuyên buổi chiều.
 --------
 Đặt bản thân chúng ta trong hoàn cảnh bị bắt nạt, nếu có người đứng lên vì mình, đứng về phía mình, bảo vệ mình, chúng ta sẽ ổn hơn nhiều đúng ko?
 mình hỏi em là mình đăng bài phốt tụi bạn lên fb được ko? em không chịu vì không muốn những người bắt nạt em đọc được. em muốn mình đăng nó lên insta để tìm sự đồng cảm, thấu hiểu từ bạn bè. tâm lý chung là vậy hay sao mn?

                              <span>Hello! I am writing a Vietnamese character into my historical fiction story. It takes place in the 1920’s-40’s era and I’d love to get advice/opinions/resources for research on this character. I want her family to have moved to the USA when she was young (maybe around 12? She was born in 1892) But I’d love to know what kind of traditions the family might follow and bring with them to the states, what immigration was like at the time, etc. I know there were immigration rules in place at the time that might affect them and France was involved in colonialism in Vietnam at the time. I’ve had trouble finding any information on Vietnamese immigration to the USA before the war. I’d also like to be told about any history I should know that would affect this story, what people want me as a white writer to avoid when making a Vietnamese character, and what people want to see when it comes to Vietnamese women in fiction. So far I have her name as Chau Tahn Liên and I’ve named a few of her family members like her brothers, sister, parents, aunt and uncle, cousin, and paternal grandparents. I’d love to know if the name makes sense especially for the time or if i should make changes and what they should be. If you take the time to read and respond to this I want to say thank you in advance. I can explain more of her character to what people ask.

                              <span>Hello everyone! I’m travelling to Vietnam with friends on early february 2024. We’ll be staying in Sa Pa for 2 days (more or less), and we’re looking for a trekking route to do that is not crowded. In fact, we’re looking for a medium-hard trekking (we’re young and fit) where we’re not gonna be surrounded by tons of people. Is it possible to sleep in the mountain with a tent? Is it too cold or illegal? Thanks a lot!

 Unfortunately it’s makes sense why Americans didn’t rank so well in the latest poll in this sub. Hope he gets some professional help, especially by any in this sub that may personally know him.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a foreign man living in Vietnam now and have been dating a Vietnamese woman for the past seven months. She has been super kind, lovable, friendly, and more. She&#x27;s been the best woman I&#x27;ve ever dated - but there is one thing that is getting in the way, and has suddenly become an issue. She has an aversion to splitting the bill. She has paid for dates before on a few occasions (in fact, she paid for our first one), but I would say it&#x27;s 90-10 in terms of costs between her and I. I was told this was the norm in Vietnam for dating...but is it always? What about for long-term relationships or marriage?
 Recently, I broached the issue. We agreed to go to a restaurant, but I would meet her at her place before doing so (in the past, we have usually just met directly at the place or met at her&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>my parents never spoke english at home and i only learned it when i started school. they spoke to me in vn my entire life and even now never use any english at home other than the occasional phrase or random word thrown in very rarely. i spoke it so regularly that i had a slight VN accent speaking english. even so, i still speak “broken” vn and i don’t know any vocabulary that is more advanced than very basic household terms. i don’t think i could even follow a convo if i went back to vietnam. for example i tried to watch videos on youtube or tiktok in vietnamese but i could not understand most of it. my main problem is vocab but also i only understand the accent of where my grandparents came from (the south) and have trouble with any other dialect, i met some friends at my school who are international students from hanoi and i had so much trouble even having a basic convo with them. did anyone here manage to speak fluently and have good vocabulary even if you grew up in another country? any tips to become more fluent?

                              <span>Me and my husband are planning a trip in November to Vietnam and the way the schedule works out, I end up with less time than I wish I had. So I have to make the decision between doing an over night in Ha Long Bay and only having 1.5 days in HCMC (landing ~3PM Friday and flying out 5PM on Sunday) or doing a day trip to Ha long bay and adding an extra day to HCMC. Which one would you choose and why?

I&#x27;m skeptical about this, how could the light be so bright, and there are like a million boats out there?

Getting some conflicting things from google - some sites say snow banana but others say snow banana plants don’t produce fruit so I’m not sure.

                              <span>I’m traveling solo to Vietnam soon and I like to have my pictures taken by someone (white b*tch instagram thingy, sorry). When I visited Korea, people were very happy to help me with it and they often took their time to get the best shot, which was very surprising to me! How is it in Vietnam though? Have you ever had any experience with such situation? 
 PS. Of course I would never ask for it in places, in which it would be considered inappropriate. I don’t want to offend anyone’s culture, I just want to appreciate the beauty of it!

                              <span>This is about the beach experience of Vung Tau, not the entire province. 
 I&#x27;ve been there twice (to give it a a second chance) and both times I absolutely hated it.
 What&#x27;s enjoyable about being packed like sardines in a can under a plastic cover while eating with sand flying everywhere?
 Why not eat and drink away from the sand and let people who actually use the beach have the space for some fun?
 Look at Da Nang, it&#x27;s a much better experience, why is Vung Tau so different?

She insisted that one of the 100k dong bill is a 10k dong bill, and she get a 200k dong bill in my wallet and returned my &quot;110k dong&quot;. It was so fast and I was so distracted with her actions (she told me, try her other goods blah blah). When I counted my money, a 100k dong was missing.. I went back to her and she just plainly ignored me.. 
 Left a really bad impression. I&#x27;ve been traveling for many years, and only India and Vietnam, I was shamelessly scammed..
 The almonds I bought left a really bad taste in my mouth..

Will the government recognize her as married?
 Will we gain any benefits?
 Will i gain a visa to live in vietnam for a while?
 Hard question, but if we decide to have a child, will she be considered a single mother? What will her birth certificate claim?

                              <span>I will be traveling Vietnam for the first time next year as a Viet kieu (pretty fluent in Vietnamese). I will be there for 3 weeks with arrival in Saigon and departure in Hanoi.
 I’m open to feedback on my itinerary from all of you travel experts/expats/locals. I have zero expectation on following this itinerary 100% since I know that’s not feasible and unforeseen situations may arise. I like to have my days planned out so that I’m not scratching my head on what to do when I get there.
 I enjoy food as you can tell from the amount of food tours but also enjoy activities and nature/scenery. If you have any recommendations outside of what is on my itinerary, please share. All recommendations for attractions/restaurants/coffee shops/street food/shopping centers/markets would be appreciated. Also if you guys know of any pedestrian friendly/walking areas that are not on my itinerary, please let me know. I like to explore on foot but also know that Vietnam is not the most walk friendly country.
 Is 3 days too long for Ninh Binh? I like that cycling is a great option to explore the area but will I run out of things to do?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Westerners attending Vietnamese friends&#x27; wedding party in Vietnam. Should we bring a gift? I was reading that it&#x27;s common to bring money to cover the party costs? If that&#x27;s the case, what should be a proper amount?
 Our friends lives in the same Western country as we do. Which makes deciding the amount even harder. What would be a reasonable amount in Vietnam might be a low amount in our country.

 What towns in central/South Vietnam would be good to chill in? Relaxed vibe, not too busy, good good. All we really want to do it eat and rest and go to the gym.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on holiday staying in a hotel and tonight found a cockroach in my bedroom, it&#x27;s the first night in this hotel (in Hoi An).
 They gross me out, so I&#x27;m almost definitely overreacting but I just can&#x27;t stand them.
 Anyway, I reported this to the reception and they said as it&#x27;s rainy season (there has been heavy rain in the last few weeks) it&#x27;s likely they&#x27;ve come up through the toilet/drain.
 Is this actually something that happens?
 They&#x27;ve offered to change our room in the morning to a higher floor, presumably with less chance of them coming up through the drains.
 Wondering if there is any point in doing this?
 I guess I&#x27;m really wondering if this is something the hotel can&#x27;t help/has no power over or if I should be looking at this another way.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Since I bought my plane ticket I’ve been lurking here a bit. My friend (45m) and I (40m) are coming to Vietnam from about Jan 1 to Jan 31. 
 Neither of us like planning much so right now I’m inclined to just book a hotel or air b and b for 7 days to start in HCMC and figure out the rest after we get there. 
 We will probably bounce over to Thailand for a few days, maybe Cambodia and Laos and I have to pop up to Hong Kong to see a friend for a few days. 
 Mostly we just want to explore and eat, maybe do some light hikes and we’ll probably both spend a decent amount of time alone. 
 Is it pretty easy to work stuff out after we get there?
 Also, kinda random but is Amex accepted pretty widely there? I have other cards, but I prefer to use that one.

                              <span>My friend recently obtained a Vietnamese passport in the United States for the first time as a Viet Kieu. 
 Now they need to travel to Vietnam to receive an &quot;entry stamp&quot; as proof of entering the country with their Vietnamese passport. 
 This is necessary for applying for temporary residence and eventually obtaining their CCCD/CMND. 
 The Vietnamese passport has been mailed to Vietnam and is currently in their possession. 
 They initially entered Vietnam using their American passport. 
 Now they are wondering about the next steps. 
 Should they exit Vietnam using their American passport, enter Cambodia using their Vietnamese passport, and then re-enter Vietnam with the Vietnamese passport?
 Alternatively, should they exit Vietnam with their American passport, enter Cambodia with the American passport, exit Cambodia with the American passport, and then enter Vietnam (via a border run) with the Vietnamese passport? 
 The situation is quite confusing, and any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I just finished reading Viet Thanh Nguyen&#x27;s &quot;The Committed&quot;, and I was intrigued (and a little frightened) by this photo he had featured in the book. I still haven&#x27;t found the photo&#x27;s source after many Google searches and carefully looking through the book&#x27;s acknowledgements. My only &quot;lead&quot; is Viet Thanh Nguyen mentioning certain people in his acknowledgements who helped him secure permission from the Union Générale des Vietnamiens de France to use the photo in his book. I really am curious as to what the story behind that photo is and would eventually like to learn more about the protests/rallies of the Vietnamese community in Paris.
 Any help would go a long way! (And perhaps help me sleep better since my curiosity&#x27;s been keeping me up!)
 EDIT: From the man himself. Shoutout to u/Commercial_Ad707 for suggesting I reach out to Professor Nguyen!

 Their accomplices will look to buy North Korean money again, buying at a 5-7% difference. So if you buying and selling 50 million, you will make profit of 2-3 million. 100-500 million means you can get a difference of 25-50 million. But when you exchange Vietnamese money for North Korean money, they will disappear and become uncontactable, running away with a few hundred million of your money and leaving you with a suitcase of fake North Korean money.

                              <span>So, I currently teach in some different public, middle schools in Hanoi. Today, I saw this sign in one of the classrooms. 
 My Vietnamese is low right now, but I translated the words above the picture and it says something about learning. But, the Christian, flaming Bible seems weird in a public school. I asked my TA about it and she didn&#x27;t have answers. 
 I know Christianity exists in Vietnam, there&#x27;s a Catholic church very close to my apartment and I&#x27;ve seen Mormans about. However, I never expected to see this kind of thing here.
 Can anyone shed some light on what&#x27;s up with this? Is this common? Is it meant to be Christian propaganda? Is the picture irrelevant? Is it even allowed in a public school? I&#x27;m confused.

                              <span>Hello, I am researching the history of Chinese character education (giáo dục chữ Hán) and Literary Chinese education (giáo dục Hán văn) in Vietnam and was wondering if anyone has any articles or journals (English or Vietnamese) about Chinese character education in South Vietnam (1955-1975; Việt Nam Cộng hoà). I have read several articles in English and Vietnamese, and apparently, there were classes in South Vietnam until 1975. But I could not find detailed information on it.

                              <span>Allowing drivers to turn left across opposing lane on solid green lights is a mistake in VN.
 I believe this idea was inspired by the similar traffic law in the US, except we&#x27;re forgetting one thing: Vietnamese doesn&#x27;t understand the &quot;right of way&quot;.
 This, together with the law of turning right on red were created to allow more efficiency for all drivers. But this works only if drivers are YIELDING for the opposing traffic, not crowding in the middle of opposing lane inching towards every space they see. The mentalities of giving the right of way &amp; yielding obviously don&#x27;t exist in Vietnam, so why implement it because it just makes things worse?
 We simply aren&#x27;t ready for it, mentally and morally. Or worse, we won&#x27;t admit it.

                              <span>I’ve been here 4 days and it’s happened a couple of times. Once in a shopping centre toilet and once at the airport toilet. 
 I went to the public toilets and nobody else was in there. A guy comes in and pisses in the urinal next to me while there’s 5-6 other urinals to choose from. Both times they look over to have a stare while I’m peeing. Is this normal?

If you do this and are discovered by someone inside, there may be people in green military uniforms rushing out and yelling at you something you don&#x27;t understand, even if there is no &quot;No Photography&quot; sign at the door.

Why is it not seen as a sexual violation for many people in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m planning to travel to Vietnam during december 2023 - january 2024 for a three weeks period.
 During my travel, I want to explore the Mekong Delta region and cities such as Can Tho, Chau Doc, Long Xuyen, Ca Mau and Ha Tien during a three weeks period.
 I wonder if it&#x27;s doable on a 50cc scooter (like a honda chaly or a similar scooter) or if it&#x27;s preferable to do it on a bike. (I do a lot of bike and bikepacking in France so I&#x27;m pretty ok with that).
 I didn&#x27;t have any driver licence so I can&#x27;t rent a powerful motorbike, and I don&#x27;t want to have any issues with the local police
 I&#x27;m also planning to stay in &quot;homestay&quot; like; guesthouses; etc
 So I had a few questions:
 -Can I find a long-term (3 weeks) for a 50cc scooter in Ho Chi Minh City or maybe buy one ? I wonder what&#x27;s the best solution.
 -Did the road/dirt road are practicable on a 50cc scooter or a bike ?
 -Did you have any advice about the project ?
 I already look on internet, but I can&#x27;t find so much infos on the Mekong Delta and backpacking it.
 Thanks all for your answers !
 Cheers

                              <span>I will be traveling to Vietnam and I&#x27;m prescribed Xanax (classified as a psychotropic in Vietnam). Did some research and realized it&#x27;s a controlled substance there (but not illegal?). Is it safe to bring my Xanax into the country as long as it&#x27;s in the original pharmacy container and I have a letter from my doctor? / do they even care about checking medications?
 The trip could be a disaster if it is confiscated from me! haha

                              <span>Hi. My sisters and I are going to Vietnam for the first time since we left 30 years ago. We were too little to remember our birthplace. I’m excited and nervous since our Vietnamese is at best to get our orders right at restaurants. I could use any helps or suggestions. So far, we have looked into inclusive tour package that will take us from HCM to Hanoi and all the cities in between. What are the best gifts to bring to Vietnam from America? What to avoid or to watch out for in Vietnam? I appreciate as many suggestions as possible. BTW, also my first time flying outside of America. Thank you.

                              <span>Hey all, 
 I’m traveling to Vietnam in late November for about 11 days total. I’ll be spending 5 days in Hanoi and 6 days in HCMC. I’ve been to both cities previously, as well as Da Nang &amp; Hue. So I’ve basically seen most of the touristy stuff there (including Ha Long Bay) and have decided to skip central VietNam entirely this time around.
 I’m thinking of making a side trip to Sapa while up north and potentially Da Lat or the Mekong delta while in HCMC. 
 Is two days in Sapa enough time to see most things there or should I add an extra day? Is Da Lat worth checking out for two days or so? How about the Mekong delta? I know both cities are pretty touristy and I can live with that. I just want to check out new places and get out of the hustle of the big cities. 
 Since I’ve done Hanoi and HCMC, I just plan on chilling, eating while there so my days spent in the smaller cities is flexible. 
 Also, I know the weather is hot/humid year round, but should I expect rain during this time of year?
 Thanks for any suggestions or recommendations!

                              <span>Hi All,
 We will be taking a train from Hanoi to Ninh Binh, we booked a sleeper cabin with 6 people. The seats we booked turned out to top berths. So, question - during the day time, how does it work with seating? Can we use the lower berth to sit?

                              <span>I am a Thai has learned Vietnamese for not long but I’m learning a lot of Vietnamese vocabulary quickly.
 It takes an average of 1100 hours for an English speaker to become fluent in Vietnamese but how many hours does it require a Thai user.
 The average Thai speaker knows cursory English, meaning that they know how the Latin alphabet works.
 I posted this here because I couldn’t post on r/learnvietnamese.

                              <span>I’m adopted and recently reconnected with my birth family. My boyfriend and I are staying with my birth mother right now. we had plans to leave at the end of this week. 
 A couple of days ago we were put on the spot and invited to a wedding, of who I now know is my birth mothers half sisters daughter(I found out the relation a couple days ago). We were planning on leaving before but they really wanted us to come so we said we could stay till the wedding. The bride wants us to be part of the wedding party (bridesmaid/groomsmen). I had only met her once before this. It’s very kind of them to invite us. I’ve read other things on Reddit about wedding gift giving and if you’re family or friends.
 We weren’t expecting this event at all. 
 What should we expect and how much money should we give as a gift?

What is the water temperature around this time of the year, how murky is the water really, and is it generally enjoyable? I am worried after the perfect conditions that Thai waters offer it won’t be as pleasant there.

                              <span>I studied abroad in America for four years. I completed my bachelor&#x27;s degree in Marketing and Data Analytics in 2021, and I got a job in the US in 2022. I was on STEM OPT, and my employer was willing to sponsor my H1-B visa. 
 Things were looking up for a bit, and I thought I could settle in America. However, my health worsened in September 2022, and I was constantly sick every month. I got a serious case of vertigo that made me spend a day in the ER in August. And then, a month later I got diagnosed with H Pylori, a nasty stomach virus that could cause severe heartburn. In December 2022, I got Covid after attending happy hour with my coworkers. I had to deal with all of these along with anxiety and depression. In March 2023, I decided to quit my job and move back to Vietnam because I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I didn&#x27;t even apply for the STEM extension or participate in the H1-B lottery. 
 I moved to Saigon after coming back to Vietnam (I&#x27;m from Hanoi), but I still feel like a loser for coming back to Vietnam. When I set out to study in America, my goal was to get a job and a green card and then I would choose where to live. However, things didn&#x27;t go as planned, and I am completely lost. I am scared of getting back into the corporate world because of what happened to me. I&#x27;m scared that my health will be in jeopardy again. I&#x27;m still looking and applying for jobs right now, but deep down I wish no one would hire me so that I could rest for a bit more. 
 Now I&#x27;m completely lost because the goal that I had been working towards for 5+ years was squashed, and now I have no goals or directions. If anyone could just slap me out of this confusing stage of life, please do.

                              <span>Hey guys! Just wondering if I did something wrong 4 weeks ago. I&#x27;m still pondering about it till this day. We moved in a hotel in the tourist area for a month and almost every night at this outside Huda bar there was a white puppy sitting on a folding chair. He had a leash and tip jar next to him and I would always go up and pet him (I asked if I could pet him every time). And I fell in love with the little guy. So one day I went to the pet store near by and bought some puppy sized toys to give to him. When I saw the puppy again a few days later I patted him and gave him a rope toy to play with and we tugged it and all that cute stuff. I left him with the toy and saw the puppy about a week later without it. I never saw him since then. Is it bad here to gift a dog a toy? I had no bad intent or anything I just wanted to treat him. :(

 Do you know about &#x27;pod chill&#x27; in Vietnam? I thought it was a regular vape given to me by someone, and after inhaling it 8-9 times, I collapsed. What is this? Is it synthetic weed? 
 I&#x27;m really worried 
 Are there people around who do this a lot(8-9times)? 
 I&#x27;m very concerned about possible brain damage.

But things have changed a lot after that. Feel like it’s not as hot as it was. Have you been in Phong Nha? Any thoughts about how to have more people know about this beautiful place?

                              <span>I live in VN as foreigner. I know that vietnamese love karaoke and it&#x27;s fine. Until they crank up the volume to absolutely outrageous level.
 I live in a very good place and very nice city, but unfortunately to me there are few villas nearby where drunk viet people like to sing karaoke almost every day up until midnight. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I understand they want to have fun. I understand they are drunk and don&#x27;t care about other people.
 What I don&#x27;t understand is why no one is doing anything about it? 20 drunk people affect thousands citizens who live nearby. Everyone is happy about noise? Can&#x27;t believe it.
 Now the main part: there are four 5* star hotels near these villas. Classy, expensive, with good cars around it, etc et etc. Why management is doing nothing about drunkards in villas? It is so easy to call police. It is so easy to give them some money so they patrol this area a little more often. Submit complains, escalate problems to police superiors, even bribe if needed, etc etc. But why nothing? I live here for 6 months and problem doesn&#x27;t go away. 
 I have so many questions.
 Hotel customers don&#x27;t complain even when karaoke blasts at midnight? Hotel management doesnt care about anyone? Police doesnt care about 5* star hotels?
 Maybe vietnamese customers dont care about noise even if they rich because they are used to karaoke from their childhood. But what about foreign customers who live in 5* hotels? They don&#x27;t complain too? I can hardly believe foreigners love this noise while they pay big sums of money for fancy hotel.
 Can some explain me this mystery?

                              <span>Hi everyone. My husband and I are spending 1 week in Vietnam in November. Our airfare and hotel are booked. Wondering how much we should bring for food/ activities? Would $500 USD suffice for the both of us, for 1 week? Staying in Hanoi, da nang and hoi an. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>What do you say when someone nearby sneezes in VN? I generally say “bless you” in the States. “God bless you” in google translates to “Chúa phù hộ bạn.” Bút I don’t think that would be correct over here.

                              <span>I have never been to Vietnam and never had a reason too. My parents keep trying to plan a trip to Vietnam so that I can meet the &quot;family&quot; and experience Vietnam. I have zero reasons to visit let alone meet people I have never heard off and never talked. They are talking like they are forcing me too and it will not happen. 
 I do not know what ulterior motives they have for doing this and I do not want to be dragged around everywhere meeting relatives that I didn&#x27;t even know existed. It looks like a beautiful place and all these family members sound really nice. 
 Food does sound good though.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Sooo, I am a 26yo art student, viet born in western europe and would love to explore some contemporary art spaces and the creative wave that’s been happening and just learn about the people and the culture.
 The thing is that I visited last summer, the first time in 15 years and was with family most of the time. This was a beautiful experience but also, I was super annoyed with how paranoid my family was about me doing stuff alone. I always needed someone of my family to be there with me or someone they knew to escort me around for the most simple things like getting a juice around the corner. 
 The main thing they’re scared off is me being sold, kidnapped or deceived and drugged, because I’m recognizable as a Viet Kieu and am female. Sometimes I get mistaken for being fully foreigner, like Thai or Indonesian, cause I don’t look like the typical Viet when it comes to my style or my accent, or whatever reason they say I don’t look like a typical viet. (fam also say I’m too ‘hiện’ lol)
 The thing is, I just want to explore places, meet likeminded creatives and enjoy my culture outside of the family. But is it true that I’m not safe doing things on my own? Can I really not take Grab’s without the chance of being kidnapped? Can I really trust no one?
 My family be saying crazy stuff like ‘dont go on dates cause if you reject him, he’ll drug you’ or ‘white people have it easier in VN than Viet Kieu’ 🤡
 Anyway, thoughts? I just wanna explore new spaces and hang out with new people but how my family puts it; I’m in danger as a female not viet-born person doing things on my own.

                              <span>Hi all! I will be visiting your country in January 2024. I&#x27;m currently booking places to stay and I can&#x27;t seem to figure out any good places to visit between Hanoi and Hue. I&#x27;ve come across Dong Hoi, is this city worth visiting? Are there other cities/towns between the two aforementioned cities? Should I just take on overnight train or bus to Hue instead? 
 Thanks so much for your advice:)

                              <span>I have a little over 3 days left in Vietnam. I’m in Da Nang at the moment and am considering going up to Ba Na Hills. I plan to spend the other days exploring Hoi An, so trying to figure out what’s the best way to spend the other day. 
 Is it worth it?
 Generally I’m not a fan of those tourist trap kind of places, but the views from up there look incredible. It is also pretty damn expensive though.

We are talking about behaviours in Vietnam, for example: bad manners, noise, arrogance, rudeness, lack of respect, crime, cheapness, drugs abuse, physical fights, etc.... The poll only allows 6 choices so I added the ones frequently mentioned in this group lately. If you feel I have missed an important one place it in the comments. This is only meant as a point of discussion and not to antagonize any specific group of people. Please by civil in the discussion.

                              <span>I know the VCP is less authoritarian than the CCP and more socially progressive. However, I&#x27;m not too sure on the other metrics. Is it overall more effective at managing the country, the economy, and infrastructure? Does it receive more support from the Vietnamese population than the CCP does from the Chinese population. Is the VCP more corrupt than the CCP or less?

                              <span>Hey, so i began a master degree in international business and they offer me to learn a asian language for 1 year and go there for 6 month to have vietnamese course. I choose vietnam because japan, china and korea don&#x27;t interested me. And i think southest asia is my favorite part of asia (even if i only did 2-3 countries in asia). But now i realize it&#x27;s kind of a big choice i&#x27;ve made and begin to question that choice as i don&#x27;t know if i really want to work there and if it&#x27;s worthy. Is there any foreigner learning Vietnamese with no origin ? And how do you think vietnam will evolve in the futur ?

 My family is Korean-Canadian and my sister is getting married to a Vietnamese Canadian and as a consequence, I made my way over here for the first time to go to the wedding. I own a small tech firm in Korea and since its a bit of a trend in Korea to outsource parts of development to Vietnam, I thought I&#x27;d spend my time in between touring and meeting future family and gorging myself with food to test the waters myself and arranged some meetings with some businesses here. 
 Not all the meetings I&#x27;ve had were with Korean people running shop here in Vietnam, but the meetings I&#x27;ve had with Koreans here have not been good to say the least.

 i understand that there are always good and bad people, especially in dating apps. but, if you&#x27;re here for a beautiful girl that is willing to go with you to an alcoholic place on first date within 5 seconds of talking on the app, you deserve it.
 please, for the safety of yourself, try to find the red flags. sometimes they&#x27;re very obvious, unless you&#x27;re thinking with your reproductive organ.

                              <span>I have 2 family members ( cousins ) that I loan money to a few years ago. 1k usd each, first cousin was for her start up business and the other was another 1k usd to take her mom to the doctor/big hospital in SG... Which she never took her, &quot; she got better &quot;. I haven&#x27;t talked to the 1st cousin with the start up business over a year, but I do have her FB. The second cousin agreed she would pay me back this Tet when I visit VN. She usually call and ask how I&#x27;m doing and such but after the loan and I found out she didnt take her mom to the hospital , she kinda went MIA. I do have proof and receipt when I transfer the money. 
 Would it be rude of me if I just call them up out of nowhere to remind them that still owe me money? or should I just wait until I see them when I land and ask for it? 
 anybody has experiences of getting your money back from family members, let me know lol.

 The problem I have is that I found out she is quite close with a colleague there and I think it may be more than just close... I have tried to translate the texts that I have but I just don&#x27;t understand Vietnamese (especially with abbreviations and slang!) on top of that, I don&#x27;t know how male-female friendships are supposed to be in Viet Nam, can anyone help me?

                              <span>Hello everyone! My husband and I are visiting Vietnam this upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. We are planning a trip with my parents who live in Vietnam for 5 days during the 2 weeks before the holiday. My parents want to go from Quang Binh to Hoi An in 5 days. They want to visit Phong Nha Cave, Paradise Cave, Hoi An, Da Nang, and Hue. The plan is that we will land in Da Nang and travel with them immediately.
  
We will not use a tour agency so I am a little afraid of how many destinations they want to go to within such a small timeframe. Definitely, we will use public transportation to commute and that takes a lot of time to commute already. 
 The current itinerary: Quang Binh (1 day), Hue (1 day), Da Nang (1-2 day), and Hoi An (1 day)
 I hate jet lag and I want to take it slow to adjust to the local time when I first land. 
 We would like to enjoy the trip rather than move through each location super fast. We are considering tailoring in Hoi An for our wedding and it seems to not be doable with this iterary.
 I heard Hoi An is super crowded and 2 out of 5 days we plan to travel are weekends. 
 We love our parents but at the same time, we really want to visit Da Nang-Hoi An without rushing it.
  
Do you think this is a good idea? How can we commute between places if this trip is doable?
 I am gearing towards traveling to Ha Noi (3 days) and Halong Bay (cruise-2 days) so that we can experience the Northern vibe of the Tet holiday and enjoy more time on the trip.

Some pieces were really light in colour and some really dark.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi yall, I&#x27;m a Mormon currently residing in Hanoi. I have always been rather ecumenical, and find beauty in all faith traditions, Christian or otherwise. Attending services of other religions is something I greatly enjoy, and it helped greatly with my spiritual growth. Any recommendations for interesting churches worth a visit? I prefer Christian services, but recommendations for places of worship of other faiths are also welcome. Thank you.

                              <span>Có ai ở đây gặp tình trạng như mình chưa ? Mình dùng redmi note 11 pro plus 5g. Máy mình bị lỗi âm lượng, ấn giảm 1 nấc thì tăng hết cỡ, nó có ghi lại báo cáo lỗi, đây là lần 2. Lần đầu thì nó báo lỗi xong mình khởi động lại máy, dùng như bình thường. Lần này thì nó lại đưa về main menu. Mình tìm hiểu mới biết nó là xóa dữ liệu đưa máy về trạng thái mới tinh. Mình mới tá hỏa ra nhưng k còn cách nào khác nữa. Mình có khởi động lại 4 lần thành công nhưng máy về trạng thái mới tinh, và có thêm logo &quot;safe mode &quot;. Mình làm theo các bước khởi động như trên mạng nhưng đều như vậy. Đến lần 5 thì thành công đưa máy về trạng thái mới hoàn toàn, k còn logo. Nhưng khi mình nhập gmail thì có tên gợi ý tài khoản gmail trên bàn phím, mặc dù mình chưa từng gõ tên tài khoản đó sau khi khởi động. Mình muốn hỏi là có cách nào để khôi phục lại hết các dữ liệu trong máy không ? Ảnh, video, tài liệu, tài khoản ?

                              <span>Hey I am male and I am looking for a good massage place with male masseurs in Ho Chi Minh.
 Preferably I am looking for full body massages or body scrubs. I’ve been to Vietnam already and been to the Miu Miu spa and liked the massage there but it was a female masseur and I didn’t feel so comfortable with that. I’ve also been to the Tarzan spa but that was more like a hidden brothel and the „massage“ was really bad. Definitely not looking for a happy ending thing. Looking for a proper massage!
 Price range should be around 500k. Would appreciate any serious tips maybe someone knows a good place.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Helloo I am doing research on the avocado sector in Vietnam. Does anybody have some reliable sources about the history of the avocado industry in Vietnam or information about the (current) avocado production chain or any information at all about the avocado cultivation, the marketing behind it, human/workers rights, sustainable cultivation etc.
 Anything is welcome and helpful!
 I do this for a report for my minor in International Development Management, I do know how to search for sources, but I have done this for other projects as well and Reddit always surprises me with very helpful sources and information🤗
 I you are someone or know someone who works with or in the Vietnamese avocado chain who is willing to partake in an interview also please let me know! 
 Thanks in advance!

 I am visiting Hanoi in November and on 22nd I have a video interview session from 4pm - 9pm (Vietnam time). Where can I go in Hanoi to get computer access and good wifi for video calling so I can do my interview?
 I am quite stressed about this so thank you all in advance!

                              <span>I know it’s a delusional stretch but anyone know where I can go out for American thanksgiving ? (Highly likely won’t have it but not afraid to ask) I’m on my 3 rd month in VN and miss American holiday like this since it’s been a rough year and like to celebrate those close to me.

                              <span>Today we had lunch in a small restaurant close to Ninh Binh, while eating we noticed the owner taking photos of us, we were the only people there... Only 30 minutes after we had left we see new photos on their Google Maps, the photos she took of us and also screenshots from a security camera! 
 Why do people do this? And is this a common thing?

                              <span>The title says pretty much everything. I am a foreigner that opened a company in Vietnam. I hired an external company to help me out with accountancy/payroll. But they are an absolute disaster. The first accountant they assigned was a delinquent that made illegal movements in my bank account. And in the past 6 months I have had 6 different accountants assigned to me. All of them are late in filing the paperwork, I have to constantly chase them, and they hardly reply to emails.
 So does anyone know where to find a good accountant that can help with accountancy and payroll? If not in this forum, somewhere else? I am relatively new in Vietnam and I am not sure where else to look. Any help is appreciated.

 If such beaches don’t exist on PQ anymore, how’s Côn Đảo? TIA

                              <span>are there a lot of teochew people in vietnam? my family is second generation in vietnam. with both of my grandparents being born in vietnam and my mom born in vietnam as well. my family is pretty vietnamese but our roots are teochew people of china. i was born in america but pretty much identify as being vietnamese american. it’s kind of hard to identify that i’m chinese bc i don’t really know much about chinese culture other than some things about being teochew. anyone else relate to this struggle? like i feel fake by saying i’m vietnamese bc i’m technically chinese. yet my second language is vietnamese where i am fluent. and when i say i’m chinese i feel like most people immediately think mandarin or canto which i cannot relate to at all. makes me sad to see my teochew lineage slipping away. my dad is also teochew but cambodian born. my grandma on my dad side speaks teochew but i’m not as close to her and she also identifies a lot with khmer culture.

                              <span>I went to Vietnam in June for a few weeks with my wife and daughter. We went to Ho Chi Minh City, Que Nhon, and Dalat. We decided to buy insurance from Berkshire Hathaway Travel protection. We chose the coverage that only covered medical emergencies. The price was less than 100$. Mid way through our trip my daughter became very sick fever ect. She had a bacteria infection which landed her in the hospital for anti-biotics when over the counter did not do the trick. We stayed at Vinmec got receipts for everything and ended up staying in the hospital for 7 days. The cost for everything came out to around 3,000. Vinmec gave us all receipts in English and Vietnamese. I opened a case with Berkshire while on Vietnam and they said I had a year to send all docs. When we got home I sent all receipts and charges from my credit card they also asked for bank statements and after 25 days I received a check for the full amount. They covered the hospital stay, medicine, emergency room visit too. It was my first experience with Berkshire but will use them in the future. I recommended this to my friend that also went recently and she also has to take her daughter to the hospital it wasn&#x27;t expensive but it sounds like it was covered her bill was only 300$

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using zalo for the last 3 years. My partner and I use the app all the time. The past few weeks, I&#x27;ve had &quot;people&quot; add me saying that they knew me and claiming we have met before. I googled the picture of the first person from Việt Nam and the search came up with a Korean celebrity. The second person added me and sent me a message and I blocked them immediately. Is this something common on Zalo? My partner thinks the app has been compromised and that our info might be compromised as well. I was wondering if it was something common and that we are just beginning to experience it later than sooner. Should we just continue on blocking them? Has this happened to any of you using Zalo?

                              <span>I spent a few years in Vietnam until 2019, mostly in Saigon and Hoi An (the latter is where my family came from). The country is, honestly speaking, nothing sort of magical yet incredibly flawed. Really love it from a visitor’s perspective thou. These are some of the photos I took using a film camera between 2018 and 2019.

First of all, should I take a 1N2D cruise or a day cruise. Second of all, which cruise should I take and where should I look for it ?, and most importantly what’s the difference between route 1 and route 2 ?

But my skill is still not good. I would like to message some Vietnamese. I visited Ho Chi Minh City last year and I didn’t know much. It would be cool to learn more. My girlfriend is from Vietnam and I want to surprise her with my progress.

                              <span>Sorry for long post as it may help bring awareness. I want to share a dating experience I had in HCMC with a scammer on badoo that I met in person who’s trying to blackmail.
 I got a message from a badoo account “BlueSky” from a “girl” who claimed that they are single mom looking for relationship and works as sales manager at a BMW showroom. When I asked her Zalo, she said she will share only after meeting. I said let’s meet in person for coffee next day, I noticed she kept asking to send the meeting address almost every hour but I said I’ll send next day before the meeting time.
 Eventually I texted her the cafe address and was waiting. She said she’s lost and trying to find the cafe, I video called her several times but she declined. So I felt maybe it’s a prank and left the cafe.

                              <span>Hi! I (27F) am going to Vietnam from Dec 13th - Jan 2nd with two friends (27F, 26M). We are super excited :) 
 After exploring the country for a while, we would like to enjoy the beach and the sun before returning to -15°C and snow in Norway. After the beach we will go to HCM for NYE. 
 We have looked at Phu Quoc, but I am reading a lot about construction and trash here on Reddit. We don&#x27;t have the budget to stay at a super fancy resort, but could pay to stay at the beach during the day. It seems like the island fits our preference in terms of weather, but I would love your opinion on the island in December in general. 
 Con Dao also seems interesting, if anyone has some input. 
 We are looking for: beach, sun, chilling (but also some activites). 
 I appreciate your help :)

                              <span>Long story short, I&#x27;m supposed to ask about this during the interview but since I worried of getting the place first, this glossed over my mind. Is it too late to discuss about it or there&#x27;s a chance of recovery? Also, I just finished my first week.

 ​
 my girlfriend is vietnamese, she likes reading a lot but here in France she doesn&#x27;t have access to a lot of books in vietnamese, so I was thinking to get her an ebook reader so she could download the books she wants directly to the ebook. Do you know where to get them?
 If you do, can you give me some links? And if you have recommendations of nice books to have that have been translated to vietnamese, or vietnamese books as well of course.
 ​
 Thanks : D

                              <span>Good evening, 
 I’m heading to HCMC for five days next week. When I was there last year, I was turned away from several money changers in the D1 area, namely a couple in Saigon Centre when I approached them with USD100 bills. They were more than happy to take my Singapore dollars though. Can’t quite remember what their explanations were (because I was getting quite frustrated and worked up then) so I thought I would check in here before I bring along USD on me again on this trip. Can I use Revolut/Youtrip in HCMC? 
 Thanks y’all!

                              <span>Hello everyone! I am a tourist visiting Vietnam and I have a question. My partner and I are currently in Nha Trang and I was about to buy some fruits from a market. I chose 2 apples and a kaki fruit, the owner said it cost 190k, which I think is a lot (same fruits would cost me only about 50k in my home country), so I offered 50k instead, which they refused after a bit of back and forth. My partner said to go, it&#x27;s a scam but I feel bad/unsure. I know as tourists we usually get offered higher prices but I&#x27;m wondering if there is maybe something &quot;special&quot; about these fruits that make them expensive. What do you pay for these or would pay maximum for fruits like apples? Was this a scam or..? Thank you very much :)

 This week I met her again, I joked about how she gave me a cold, and she showed me TikTok video about anh bị cảm rồi, where the people proceeded to dance. 
 I am trying to learn Vietnamese to understand her and her culture, but I have checked the translation and still do not understand the meaning behind the joke. 
 I just smiled at her and told her I do not understand her joke. She was a little disappointed. 
 Can someone explain the joke to me?

                              <span>Anyone else encounter extremely rude native Korean tourists? We’ve been going to Korean dense cities &amp; I’ve noticed they’re very rude. And I know they’re Korean because I can hear them speak it.
 **I’m not saying it’s only native Koreans, but most of my interactions have been this way. I never experience this with Korean Americans back home, rich or middle class, so that’s why I’m so culture shocked by this behavior!
 Examples:
 Usually people move aside or try to avoid hitting the other person when walking opposite directions on a sidewalk.
  
I’ve been very harshly shoved by the shoulders or arms by Korean tourists who don’t even attempt to avoid me even when I try to avoid them. They’ll walk in a straight line, unwaivering, &amp; will shove me hard then keep walking straight without looking back at who they hit. This has happened on multiple occasions where they can easily avoid hitting me as I try to avoid them.
  
Waiting
  
When waiting in line, I’ll just have a random Korean person shove their way in front of me as if I don’t exist. Same thing if I’m looking at something, but I’m standing to the side to allow others to walk by. 
 They’ll stand close &amp; right in front of the displays, blocking me even though it’s clear I’m looking &amp; trying to grab something.
  
Seats
  
At busy buffets, they’ll deny you sitting at the end of their empty table &amp; far away by saying it’s full. Meanwhile, it’s empty the entire time we’re there. 
  
I haven’t experienced that with British, American, or Uzbek tourists at all. It’s literally just native Koreans. It’s driving me nuts! ESPECIALLY being hit &amp; shoved! Teens don’t really do it, children I get, mid-20’s-60’s+ do it without care.

                              <span>I know this has been asked a million times but the laws are constantly changing on this. What are the rules about names currently? I’ve heard that people used to do Vietnamese family name, English name, Vietnamese name. That way the child basically has two first names and can choose which one to use based on where they are. 
 Then I saw there was a new law that said they can only have an English family name. This makes no sense to me because no one in Vietnam would know how to pronounce my last name, and no one in America would call a child by their last name. 
 Are there other options? Can we register the baby’s name with the US first and then with Vietnam to force them to accept a different name?

Em thấy bố mẹ và anh trai tranh cãi nhau về việc mình là Đảng viên thi mình xin việc dễ hơn rồi mấy người trong công ty khi tuyển dụng mình hay làm việc với mình cũng sẽ tôn trọng mình hơn. Em nghe nó cứ gai gai sao á.

                              <span>I’m going to be in Saigon for the entire week of Christmas with my wife. This will actually be our honeymoon since getting married. For context, I am a Vietnamese American and my wife is a Vietnamese Australian and we are not too familiar with the city since we both left at a very young age. We will be staying in District 4 and I want to plan out things to do and places to eat. If possible, I want to avoid tourist places. Any suggestions?

                              <span>(Forgive me, I&#x27;m not even Asian, but this question popped into my head for some reason)
 Are aunties and mothers and grandmothers constantly trying to get their younger relatives married off? Or is this an outdated worldview? Would they try to get a younger woman with a much older unmarried man, if he was successful, even if the age difference was extreme, or do they mostly leave them alone?

The food seems so sketchy with not that many people eating here. What I thought was a 7-11 was actually a 7-7. What I thought was a Baskin Robbin’s was just a random shop. The Lotteria…is this even real or just a fake too?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a question regarding Names in Vietnam and how to address the person properly when writing Mails, Letters etc. 
 The name is Ho Thi Kieu Phuong. So far I figured out that Ho is the Family Name and Thi is middle name addressing the gender. So should I be writing &quot;Dear Thi Kieu Phuong&quot; or just &quot;Dear Kieu Phuong&quot; or any other variation of those names? 
 Bonus Question would be about the Meaning of the Name. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know the Name in vietnamese alphabet, but hope it&#x27;s still solvable. 
 I appreciate any help with it!

 ​
 My questions are fairly basic and short and might ask more
 ​
 What is the Time Allotment in Vietnam Schools? (The schedule for the day) (Grades 1 - 12)
 What are the Aims or Goals in Vietnam Education?
 ​
 I might ask more but these 2 questions are more important! Thank you!

Especially this lovely guy, we get on great but when ever he eat, he eat with his mouth close, like super close you can&#x27;t tell if he&#x27;s chewing. He doesn&#x27;t make any noise to indicate he&#x27;s enjoying my food. That&#x27;s so rude! How can I politely tell him that if he doesn&#x27;t like my cooking he doesn&#x27;t need to eat it?

                              <span>I feel like talking about something lighthearted. Do u have any funny experiences in Vietnam? Be it with the locals, the places, or in general.
 Ill start: I know one of the English teachers recalling his story. He was teaching about holidays and used White day (valentines) as a example. One of the students then asked if White day is like Black History month but for white people?💀

                              <span>I met a very nice lady. She&#x27;s very sweet, and we can have conversations for hours. She dresses nice, exercises, and eats healthy. She&#x27;s very classy and everything seems great except she chews with her mouth open. And not a little, a lot. We had lunch yesterday and she didn&#x27;t even try to keep it closed, and talked a lot with food in there. If I were to mention this to her, she might consider it losing face and would probably ghost me.
 How can I get a nice lady to chew with her mouth closed?

                              <span>Hi, Flying into Danang in mid-january. reserve 2 nights in Hoi An and then 1 in Hue. From there I plan on riding south along Truong Son Dong Rd towards Dalat and back up the Ho Chi Minh Road to Danang (reserved night). Do you think I need to reserve lodging along the 2 roads or can I keep it fluid? rough overnights below, I know these are kinda long distances so open to advice on shorten if you think much to aggressive as I want to max at 6hour days. Dalat may be too far and cut over after Ayon Pa to Buon Ma Thuot for day 4
 ​
 Thank you in advance
 ​
 Truong Son Dong Rd
 Day 1; Hue to Thanh My
 Day 2: ride to Son Tay
 Day 3: ride to Ayun Pa
 Day 4: ride to Dalat
 ​
 Ho Chi Minh Rd
 Day5: Dalat to Buon Ma Thuot
 Day 6: ride to Kon Tum
 Day 7. Ride to Da Nang

                              <span>do you find it easy to tell from physical appearance when someone is southern chinese or vietnamese? are there any features that make it clearer to distinguish? my friend is from guangdong and im viet and we honestly look so similar most ppl (chinese or vn) couldn’t tell who’s from where, we’ve both even been mistaken for filipino before. in your experience is it usually easy to distinguish most of the time, or are there cases where it’s more ambiguous?

                              <span>Hi, I am currently backpacking around Vietnam and am now in Ho Chi Minh. I see that Ho Chi Minh City FC have a game tomorrow, but I can’t see anywhere online to buy tickets. Is it possible for tourists to buy tickets? And if so where would be the best place to do this? Are home fans welcoming to tourists also? Any advise would be greatly appreciated!!

                              <span>My family is coming back to Vietnam in January and this time we have more kids so we plan to get a small van to go around because we do not live in cities (no Grab and taxis are expensive and inconvenient). My wife can drive for a year with an IDP but eventually we plan to get a driver license for both of us. I am Vietnamese and my wife is not but she can communicate in Vietnamese decently.
 For me, I know absolutely nothing about driving a car (or about a car itself). I also want to learn to drive decently and safely and we will not bribe. What can we do to prepare ahead? I heard there are some test apps online, does it make sense for me to learn them first before actually get to class? TIA.

                              <span>I have a couple of vietnamese friends and I want to learn the language for fun. Probably not in depth but just vocabulary, how to say common everyday phrases, and pronunciation/grammar. I heard duolingo is not accurate, but I want to learn correctly and maybe just know how to read specifically southern. I already know how to speak chinese so I dont know if that helps
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all.
 I&#x27;m heading to VN in a few months, I will be in Danang, Hoi An day trip, Hanoi, Cantho, and Sgn. I&#x27;m looking buy a couple of items from VN, but i would prefer not going to the market w/aggressivve vendors and negotiation hazzels.
 Here are items I like to buy: pepper, banh trang, coffee beans, dry bamboo (mang kho), and any squid and dry shrimp, I believe these are acceptable items for US. 
 Do you have a reiablie vendor recommendation? Or if you have any other recommendation to bring back to US, I muchly appreciated.
 Also - is it safe to use CC in Grab? I have friends that pay cash instead of paying cc thru app. I hate carrying cash :)
 Thank you.

 I was convinced that everything in them is fake but I recently purchased some Barbour jackets that are excellent quality and could very likely be authentic.

                              <span>So I carry this with me for quite a while already: 
 I live in Vietnam, and a friend of mine, around 30, from a European country, told me in 2021 already the he need to get to Saigon to his embassy to get a new passport. Quite difficult during Covid, he also doesn’t have big cash to pay for the trip, so he kept on delaying it, until his passport ran out of validity. 
 In early 2023 he made the trip to Saigon finally by taking the train, told me he can’t fly because no passport, so Train best option. When he came back from that trip a couple days later I asked him about passport and if he got his, he told me not yet, embassy have problems bla bla bla. 
 Since then, he told me like three times on different occasions that he moved into a new place under his girlfriends name and kinda hides from immigration and doesn’t really care. If that’s true, we talking about a looooong overstay. 
 So my question: 
 1.) I feel he‘s telling me BS, but why would make shit like that up. What’s the intention??
 2.) Assume he‘s telling the truth, what „problems“ could his embassy make to not give him a new passport?
 3.) Could he really „hide“ from VN police and just overstay months without them seeking for him / finding him? What’s the play here, they actively looking for him or just waiting and hope they catch him one day? He‘s not really „quiet“ about his situation so I know the circle of people Knowing is not small either and I just can’t imagine they not knowing and not caring and not finding.
 This whole story is so damn stupid and I can’t make sense of it. Really looking to hear some fresh opinions on that.
 Edit: Could be he meant „consulate“ instead, I know a lot of people use the word „embassy“ but actually meaning „consulate“, so that’s not the big issue here. 
 Edit 2: Thanks for the replies guys!

                              <span>How strict is Vietnam with &quot;putting yourself out there&quot;?
 In Indonesia, you can technically be deported for pretty much anything
  
Looking for a roommate, e. g. making a social media post is illegal
 Being a guest speaker at an event, even if non-paid for a volunteer-based organization
 Performing music, poetry, or doing a comedy skit at some bar/open mic can be considered illegal 
 Even having a YouTube channel that makes no money is theoretically deportable
 Meeting business owners to ask them about business collaborations (just hypothetical ones)
  
So, Indonesia is very strict. Will all of these scenarios always get enforced? No. You probably won&#x27;t get deported if you perform some music at an open mic. But it&#x27;s technically possible.
 How is it here in Vietnam?
 I&#x27;m in the meeting business owners boat. Ironically, I flew here to Vietnam because it&#x27;s just very hard to open a business in Indonesia while you&#x27;re in the country, so I thought I&#x27;d do it remotely. But now I end up seriously liking it here. It&#x27;s more foreigner-friendly here, at least from my first impressions. 
 I&#x27;m thinking about talking to some businesses about my business ideas for their feedback/thoughts on the ideas. How strict is Vietnam with &quot;advertising yourself&quot;/&quot;putting yourself out there&quot;? I wouldn&#x27;t be making any money, this is just to validate if I could try something out, at which point I guess I&#x27;d have to open a business, or fly out and do something via a German business.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>After back and forth with the driver on Google translate I asked if tolls can be included and increase in the app? He say OK and start ride. I am still in the car ride with about 2h to go and not sure when/if he is gonna ask for money and what is correct? 800k for tolls sounds to high and like he tries to scam me. Is the passenger supposed to pay for tolls on Grab? Anyway what should I do?
 EDIT: Arrived at the hotel and he was demanding extra money for the ride, lucky the there were lots of hotel staff around as I wouldn&#x27;t have felt safe otherwise. He even followed us to the lobby trying again and again asking to be added as tip etc. I rated the ride 1 star and write a report to grab about it. thanks for the help if I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten such great replies he probably would have gotten money from me as I wasn&#x27;t sure and I would have pitied him.

 I am planning to go Vietnam in January with Bamboo airline. I am from Sydney Australia. My travel agent said that bamboo airlines went bankrupt and all flights are cancelled I checked online but my flight is still there. I check the website every thing seems normal. Is this true? Is this something I should be concerned about?

                              <span>I don’t know how common this is, but this happened to me just yesterday after living here for about 7 years.
 So I was at an ATM pulling out cash, when I was done there was a man behind me and asked me to help him get his money out of his card. My first thought was that he’s trying to scam me or some other trick, who the hell asks a random stranger to pull money out of their card for them? I looked at him and he looks a little rough, probably a laborer from his clothes and calloused hands, and maybe an ethnic minority as well. He also looked honest and sincere so I thought fuck it, why not. He gave me his card, so I showed him step by step instructions on how to use an ATM, including the part where I told him to put in his PIN in secret and he blurbed out load to me 666666, I was just like bruh 😳. Anyways, we finished it up and he thanked me profusely, then left. I was just standing there dumbfounded that this dude would put so much trust in me regarding his personal finances, someone could have definitely taken advantage of him.
 Would you say this is a weird incident or is this more common than I thought?

                              <span>Like in English, I always think it’s strange to not have two separate words for “chúng tôi“ and “chúng ta” (“we” can include or exclude the person listening).
 Or in French, the counting system is infamously odd.
 It’s not about right or wrong, or which language is better. It’s about finding interesting things that native speakers might not notice.
 So what are some things you find peculiar, or confusing, or things that don’t make any sense to you in Vietnamese?
 Edit: I find the topic has been shifted to &quot;what do you find difficult in Vietnamese&quot; haha. Can we have more answers about some words or phrases or language features you find odd please? actually both directions are welcome, feel free to share

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always tended towards healthy food as a choice.
 However this year my stomach has been giving me a lot of trouble (3 years in Vietnam)
 Had it checked - no ulcer, etc. My blood pressure has also gone up.
 So, what are healthy, easily available breakfast/lunch/dinner options?
 Light, nutritious, comforting.
 (I don&#x27;t have a kitchen, so I eat out)

                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;m a Belgian student who&#x27;s coming to Vietnam later this year (march, for 2 weeks!) for a school project. I&#x27;m going to Hô Chi Minh International University.
 I&#x27;m really excited and want to make the most out of it. But I&#x27;m quite unfamiliar with Vietnamese culture, let alone language. I started to learn with duolingo, you know, the basic stuff. But I rlly want to know if there is some things I gotta do. Some do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts I might not be familiar with, or any reccomendations are welcome!!

                              <span>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember any of the lyrics, since I&#x27;m not fluent in Vietnamese. But I did try making a portion of the song in FL Studio, in the hope that someone might be able to recognise it:
 What&#x27;s the name of this Vietnamese song? - YouTube 
 Another thing I can remember was that this song was sung by a guy, dancing on stage together with a girl and the performance involved dancing in front of a giant projector curtain and sometimes walk behind it, as if they&#x27;re &quot;entering&quot; the screen world and switching back to the real world basically. Hope that makes sense

                              <span>Like the title said, how do you find one that isn&#x27;t &quot;uniform fee&quot; or &quot;water fee&quot; and still have at least 4 mil salary upward? Every where i go is the same old thing of we dont have fee but you still need to give us fee.
 And when I does give in, the goddam &quot;employer&quot; made me drive my mother(job for my mom, she retire from selling phở - now i kinda regret not forcing her to stay) all around the city to &quot;receive uniform&quot;, to meet manager and to WAIT. And in my case, they force me to buy there expensive drink when i literally have no need for ones. Like literally, I dont ask for much, just a mundane job, how do you find one here? 
 Edit: I am college student in desperate need for a job in hcm city and im really tired of meeting scams all over the places

                              <span>Hi! I’ve been invited to a wedding this January and want to make sure my wedding outfit doesn’t offend. I am not sure how conservative to dress or if there is a specific guest attire etiquette I should follow. For example, in the US females shouldn’t wear white dresses, only the bride. Would this dress work?

                              <span>Hey reddit,
 My neighbor across the street runs a restaurant. Usually theyre nice and all, no problem. The problem are the guests and staffs that keeps parking their bike IN FRONT of our gate which prevent our vehicles from moving in or out. This happened on many occasion despite many times we remind them. Is there a way we can resolve this permanently? I thought of calling local police and ask if they want a free bike but i doubt theyd do much. Destroying the bike would definitely get things more complicated.
 What would yall do?

He married princess Long Nữ, the daughter of Động Đình Vương - sovereign of the Động Đình Lake. They were then blessed with one child, a boy whom they called Sung Lam, popularly known in the kingdom as Lạc Long Quân, the &quot;Dragon Lord of Lạc”. Because of Long Nữ’s origin, their son was believed to be a descendant from the line of the Dragons. And indeed, Lạc Long Quân had extraordinary strength and supreme intelligence. But his succession from his mother’s underwater world developed in him a strong fascination…</span>

 Second hand embarrassment. Trying to be funny but failing. Thinking oneself very cool/sexy.
 Is there I word I can use in Vietnamese to make my wife understand?

 Perhaps it looks an stupid question, but we are a couple planning to go to VN the second half of Nov, and we are roach-phobic. We&#x27;ve seen many post here and there talking about this thing there: it is a south east Asia country, and face cockroaches is likely inevitable. Would you consider not travelling because of this? 
 We are searching for higher end hotels in Hanoi, Ninh Bihn and Hoi An because of this, but even the best rated ones in Booking (e.g. 9,1 - 1,3k reviews) can have a comment of cockroach found. Again, it might sound stupid, but we found cockroaches in the past and completely ruined our trips. What are your thoughts and experiences? thanks a lot

 If there is a nicer way to say “No thank you”, please let me know how to pronounce it.

 Is it something related to Lunar Calendar? Because i don&#x27;t see the same occassion in other countries like China, Singapore, Hong Kong. Or is there a deeper historical background to this?
 Also how does it differ from Valentine&#x27;s Day &amp; International Women&#x27;s Day?

Due to the housing market in Canada, I am considering moving back to Vietnam where my parents are quite well off and where I can actually afford to own a house in my lifetime.
 I can speak Vietnamese at a native level, but I&#x27;m quite scared of the reverse culture shock when I come back. Particularly the social aspect. I do not know how to socialize or flirt in Vietnamese. For example in Canada I can strike up a conversation with literally anyone with just a &quot;How are you doing today?&quot;, I don&#x27;t think such phrases exist in Vietnamese? I also enjoy nature and sports, so in the weekends I can go kayaking, paddleboating, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, fishing, camping, outdoorsy stuff. I…</span>

 My kid will be in Hanoi soon and just in case, she may running out of cash, can she uses her Bank of America ATM/Debit card to take out cash there? 
 Is it better/safer to bring her ATM/Debit card or her credit card to w/d cash as needed in Vietnam/Hanoi?
 Thanks all.

 I wanted to ask for advice on what to do and where to eat on my 48 hour layover here starting Friday night. I will be staying at the Vinpearl 81. I leave Sunday afternoon. 
 Also, will grab be available if I arrive at 9pm to the Tan Son Nhat International Airport (SGN)? What should I expect for pricing?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hey everyone, my girlfriend and I will be traveling throughout Vietnam for all of December from north (Hanoi) to south (Saigon). 
 Despite being British, I actually grew up in Vietnam, from when I was 9 to 18. I left in 2012 and haven’t been back since - so I’m extremely excited to come back home! :) I’m sure I’ll be shocked at how much has changed! It’s also my girlfriend’s first time in the country. 
 We’re going to be spending Christmas in HCMC (where I grew up), and before that well be in Hoi An. I’m wondering where we can go after for 1.5 weeks of relax. We want a nice beach destination with some beautiful properties, activities, maybe some historical sites, nice restaurants, and somewhere to celebrate the new year! 
 When I was growing up, my parents and I would take quick weekend trips from HCMC to Mui Ne/Vung Tau for the beach, but I’m not sure these are the best options. 
 We heard mixed reviews about Phu Quoc, but everyone is suggesting Da Nang! What do you all recommend? Keeping in mind it’s end of December/January. 
 Any place in particular? Would appreciate ANY help! :)) 
 Cam on!

                              <span>I remember going to Vietnam 10 years ago and having KFC but the ketchup was noticeably less sweeter and savory compared to American ketchup. I recalled my parents saying it had something to do with the fertilizer used in Vietnam.
 ​
 Does anyone notice the difference in taste? I&#x27;m not sure of what subsidies Vietnam has on any kinds of foods but does Vietnam simply not make their ketchup sweet?

 What I did: 
 The first few days I rented a motorbike to get around the city which to me counts as one of the most dangerous yet funnest things I&#x27;ve ever done abroad. The traffic is chaotic and danger imposing at almost all times yet it still flows and creates amazing experiences, given you know how to handle a motorbike + stress situations.

We did two weeks learning about Mexican culture, foods, holidays, and that section ended with the kids building a piñata. 
 For the Vietnamese section, I want to have a similar format so I’d like to end on some sort of craft or art project that is authentic. Some of my students are Vietnamese so I really want to get this right (I’d want to get it right regardless but I feel a little more pressure lol).
 Any ideas? For reference I’m teaching mostly 7th and 8th graders (12/13 years old). Any ideas or input would be super appreciated!

                              <span>Going back home I randomly stumbled this fancy looking structure. Anyone knows what this is? It&#x27;s near Doji Tower.
 I was too shy to ask the grab driver to stop lol and I don&#x27;t want to cause trouble to him too, at the same time I can only speak very very little Vietnamese. 😅 I&#x27;m just curious what this is.

 If you had a Vietnamese girlfriend is it common to give a gift? Or is it like international where it&#x27;s just kind of acknowledged?

                              <span>I&#x27;m speaking from experience and I might sound insensitive for assuming this. I apologize if this is inaccurate or 
 So my Vietnamese ex-girlfriend saids that guy should always apologize first regardless if they&#x27;re right or wrong. Especially in an argument. He would always need to &quot;nhường nhịn&quot; her. I know that my ex was not the only one with this idea, because I saw TikTok have a lot of posts about this. But most Western culture would say that communication is key and both side would need to find a middle ground to talk and apologize to each other
 In a breakup, my ex wants me to &quot;dỗ dành&quot; and &quot;níu kéo&quot; her. But Western culture would say go no contact and severe any contact. 
 I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a right or wrong, it&#x27;s just a matter of difference in culture (I guess).

                              <span>We came back from Mount Fansipan with the cablecar waiting for our cab to pick us up at the parking lot. A taxi driver approached us with a pic of us when we were arriving (we were walking into the gate). Our actual driver texted me at that moment, so i assume this was some trick, but it felt kind of eerie. 
 Moral of the story: make sure you know what your driver looks like! We confirmed with our hotel that this was not the guy. Might seem straightforward but we almost fell for it. Maybe someone else will use this as a cautionary tale :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in HCM for the last three weeks on business and I find it interesting that most of my younger Gen Z co-workers do not have particularly nice things to say about Hanoi or the North in general. According to them, the South generates most of the revenue and the North exploits it. Do war torn divisions still run deep?

                              <span>Is there any evidence that Vietnam is buying A800/H800 AI GPUs? If so, who is? Is there an AI startup here or is it becuase they are actually destined for China? I dont get it as Vietnam does not appear to be in the AI race, but I would love to see it as we when everyone has AGI, no one will have the advantage. 
 The future of AI is Open Source anyways so all these bans really only slow down big corps who are destined to loose the race to open source anyways.

 I&#x27;m looking for some resources to learn southern vietnamese. I have already searched on Google/Reddit and asked on Discord, but the amount of resources are very limited, especially for trying to learn southern vietnamese, so I&#x27;m posting on reddit to see if there&#x27;s any other resources.
 I understand there&#x27;s more resources for the Northern dialect, and that Northern Vietnamese is the standard, but my family/relatives speak Southern, and I&#x27;d like to increase my vocabulary and grammar knowledge. I can speak a little bit, but need to use a lot of English words since I don&#x27;t know many words.

                              <span>Hey all,
 So I lived in Vn for a few years and I absolutely love the place. 
 I&#x27;m looking at coming back to do business now my country has signed a free trade deal with Vietnam. 
 Some friends and I have been trying to contact various places to establish contact with experts in several fields, and we find more often than not that emails on official websites are either unmonitered or they bounce back as inactive addresses. 
 Now I know that business in Vietnam is very much a face-to-face kind of thing, but we&#x27;re trying to establish some form of rapport before we come over for a expeditionary visit. 
 How do people on the ground deal with this? 
 Are phone calls and not email the primary means of making initial contact with people?
 I&#x27;d appreciate some advice for making contacts in Vietnam before we travel there. 
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m traveling to VN in January and will be there until June or so. I plan to stay in 3-5 cities for about 1-2 months at a time with weekend getaways other times. What do you recommend I travel with? I&#x27;m debating between a large rolling suitcase or buying a 30L-ish travel backpack. 
 I intend to use Grab for getting around and maybe splurging to rent a car for traveling longer distance? I&#x27;m not sure and could use some guidance. I welcome any clarifying questions. Thank you!

 I’d say reply with a photo but not sure if you can. These drivers always make me laugh a bit. 
 Once I saw like 20 ducks hanging from a bike, more flowers than a florist, and just loads of boxes.

 this will be a small guide for all the people (especially the western tourists) who are active on tinder in the city of Hanoi.
 First of all: Be aware, there are a lot of Scamming Girls active in this city!
 My friend and I got scammed a few days ago and I don’t want anybody else to fall for this kind of tourist trap. My friend matched a cute vietnamese girl on tinder and she said „let’s go eat somewhere“. So far so good. She said she knew a good restaurant in the are, north of Hoan Kiem Lake. As we are 2 guys travelling around my friend asked her to bring a friend. We went out on a date with them and everything seemed to be fine. We got a lot of compliments like „you are handsome boys“ and stuff like this, of course we liked it. Because we are gentlemen, we p…</span>

                              <span>I am from the UK and am currently in the solo portion of my travels in Vietnam.
 Having just spent 5 days in Da Nang - largely stuck in my hotel room due to torrential rain - I had the bright idea to travel to my next destination (Hoi An) by walking the entire length of the 25km beach on the Da Nang’s east coast.
 It started out great: the weather was nice enough, there were fishermen and families around, and the scenery was perfect for a long hike. I had 2.5L worth of water and OJ with me too, so I was all set.
 However, at around maybe 2/3rds the way - and I didn’t notice at the time, because the transition was quite subtle - it slowly started to become increasingly more uninhabited and barren.
 I only started to realise this when I noticed a presumably stray dog up ahead, and nobody els…</span>

                              <span>Mình là người Việt Nam và mình ít quan tâm đến Showbiz nhưng tần suất việc Trấn Thành được nhắc đến gần đây trên mxh và là một trong những nguyên nhân khiến phim mới của anh ta bị ghét khiến mình thắc mắc? Là người Việt Nam nếu bạn không thích hay thậm chí ghét Trấn Thành thì tại sao? (Mình thấy đây không phải lần đầu Trấn Thành và phim mà Trấn Thành tham gia bị ghét).

 I&#x27;ve tried calling Vietjet but when I call it says their number is currently busy on another call, I&#x27;ve sent them an email as well.

                              <span>Growing up in America and living in both the Midwest and California, I always thought pho is the most popular dish to Vietnamese since there are way more pho restaurants than any other types. 
 After arriving here in ho chi minh city, I realize that may not be true. I only see a pho place for every 50 com tam, hu tieu place.
 Is it because pho is more appealing to non vietnamese folks? My observation is just in the ho chi minh city region so far, not sure about other regions.

Then, I&#x27;ll transfer money to this account and withdraw it as needed on my trip rather than carry a bunch of cash with me.
 I will be staying in Hanoi if that makes a difference. Thank you

                              <span>I’m going to Vietnam in January (likely staying two months) with a Vietnamese friend (so language barriers won’t be a huge impediment) and I have a lot of ideas for destinations I’d like to see already. Many popular spots, some less popular ones like coffee plantations and some temples. But I am planning to stay in Saigon and Hanoi each for an extended period to immerse myself, meet locals, and learn about the ways lives are lived there. (What other reason is there to travel?) I am wondering if anyone has any useful insights for extended stay in these cities, or even suggestions of other cities or towns which would have much to offer for an immersive stay. For extra context I am a writer, a historian (primarily of race and racism in the United States but with interests far beyond that as well) generally interested in social hierarchies and looking to also learn about the realities of Vietnamese socialism/socialist-oriented capitalism.

                              <span>Booking a cruise to Bai Tu Long Bay on Adoga, has anyone done it? Do you get the same all inclusive package as if you book through a travel agent or the company. It is just so much cheaper on Adoga. Lots of people have said book in person, it&#x27;s cheaper, but I haven&#x27;t seen the in person prices, any insight on that would also be helpful.

                              <span>Remember Remember the 5th of November...
 Because that is when this unique board game convention takes place!
 Though board games have been a part of Vietnam&#x27;s past time for a while, with traditional games like cờ tướng (Chinese chess) or ô ăn quan (Square Capturing), mordern board games are relatively new to the mass audience. As such, there have not been many big events dedicated to this awesome hobby.
 Started out as a local event for tabletop gamers, we are bringing back Board Game Fest for the 3rd time, this time on a scale bigger than ever before. With 150 game tables, hundred of board games and several dozen of Game Master and staff, we hope this will be a welcoming event for everyone, young and old, Vietnamese and foreigners alike. There will be many booths with all the big board game coffees in Hanoi, leading board game publishers from Vietnam where you can experience their games/ services. Whether you are new to board game and want to try out some amazing-looking games; or want to check out some of our never-before-seen self-published titles; or just want to hang out and potentially meet someone who shares your interest, there is something for you at our event.
 The event venue will be at TH School - yes that&#x27;s the beautiful pink building right on Chua Boc street. Book your tickets now to enjoy the best deal (we are only selling tickets to provide a big nice venue for the event). Details in the poster below!
 If you&#x27;re anyway interested and have further question, feel free to reach me via PM or via our FB page. Our team want make this a meaningful annual event and help grow the tabletop community, so I really hope you will consider joining our tables, and hope we will have a great time together!!

                              <span>Khi đi lướt qua ngã tư Giải Phóng - Trường Chinh, ta có thể bắt gặp hình ảnh một số quầy bán xăng được chứa trong bình nhựa bày la liệt trước cửa hàng xăng dầu (cửa hàng đang để biển ngưng nhập hàng). Đôi khi tôi còn thấy chính những nhân viên bán xăng ra ngồi quầy. Có thể thấy rằng hành vi này thực sự xấu, nó nguy hiểm khi người dân thi nhau tàng trữ chất gây cháy nổ và không hề có biện pháp phòng ngừa, nó thực sự gây hoang mang cho tôi, cảm tưởng như rằng chúng ta sắp hết sạch xăng và không có gì để dùng khi đó việc kinh doanh như vậy sẽ đem lại nhiều lợi nhuận. Mong tình trạng này sớm được giải quyết và thu nhỏ.

                              <span>My landlord has various altars around the house. They all have an array of flashing multicolour lights that are on 24/7. 
 The small altar downstairs at the entrance of the house is particularly annoying, because it&#x27;s always in the corner of my eye. My bedroom door is glass so I can see the lights flashing all the time when I go to bed at night. 
 What is the purpose of the lights? Is it really important they always be on? I&#x27;m wondering if it would be a big deal if I turned off the lights at night, and just made sure to turn them on again when my landlord comes to pray. As far as I know it&#x27;s the money altar, it&#x27;s not the main ancestral altar, that one is upstairs.
 Edit: thanks for the feedback, I won&#x27;t interfere with the altar

                              <span>Does the average person pay taxes in Vietnam? 
 Im traveling and recently had a guide tell me that the average person in Vietnam does not pay taxes unless they work for the government. He didn’t really seem willing to explain further than that, so we didn’t ask. Is it true that most people don’t pay taxes in Vietnam? 
 If so, how are infrastructure projects funded and who pays government employees salaries? I don’t mean to sound ignorant, just genuinely curious. Thank you!

                              <span>I can&#x27;t be the only one thinking about this, Vietnam has a 40% market share for iPhones, but this doesn&#x27;t make sense with the current wages in Vietnam. Some quick numbers here for discussion:
 Cheapest iPhone 15 listed: $799
 Average monthly salary in VN: $733
 iOS Market Share in VN: 40%
 Average monthly salary in Singapore: $6,324
 iOS Market Share in Singapore: 34%
 Average monthly salary in Malaysia: $1,485
 iOS Market Share in Malaysia: 33%
 An intern of mine bought an iPhone 15 for 4x her monthly salary, and is willing to finance it through a 12 months installment. This obsession is pretty fascinating to me, so local peeps please weigh in. But here&#x27;s my 2 cent: if you need to finance a mobile phone, then you&#x27;re not financially capable of owning it.

                              <span>Hi, I usually flying solo and I want to know if vietnam is safe enough for woman to travel alone. 
 I usually visit landmark places and sometime nightlife, also any recommendations on good scenery coffee café could be nice too.
 Is there anything I should be concern of? For example; any dress code or things I shouldn&#x27;t wear in public, public transportation, dining, any precautious welcome!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I have my anniversary with my wife coming up in a few weeks and I’d like to take her to an upscale/ fine dining restaurant. We live in Đồng Nai, so I’m not super familiar with HCMC locales. I’ve tried doing a little research online, but I just don’t really trust what’s honest opinions and what’s advertising. I’m hoping some people can help me by making some suggestions. Much appreciated!

                              <span>If you love zombie movies you have given some thoughts on what happens if something like a zombie apocalypse happens in Vietnam.
 My thoughts are Mekong Delta region would be swarmed with hordes of zombies and would be really dangerous to live. Crowed Cities like HCMC or Hanoi would be totally infected in just a couple of days considering the population density.
 Vietnamese dont have guns. So people would be defenseless. Its dangerous to engage zombies in a melee combat. Except groups of ex militants. But zombies are not good as traversing hard terrain. And Vietnam is full of such terrain,85% of territory is mountain so if you just go and make a settlement in a sloppy area. You should be safe. Except for anomalies.
 Best thing i can think of to do is go to high altitude area. A really high place.I would like move to North West or Tay Nguyen regions. Fansipan is a good choice.The Mainly hunting or can even cultivate if you have some offensive weapons to take dons a couple of zombies that might appear. My choice is live on the top of terraced fields so you never worry about food.Vietnam would be among the safest places against zombie. If you have some resources to sustain your self in remote hard terrain.

                              <span>Hi guys, hope this is within the community rules. I&#x27;m now living in the UK but need a Vietnamese Police clearance because I lived there for a year in 2011. I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble with the Ministry of Justice not picking up the phone or answering my emails. The embassy in London says they have nothing to do with the process apart from witnessing me sign the documents and stamping them. Has anyone else had this experience? At this point I&#x27;m willing to pay for an agency which could help and make this easier.

                              <span>From my perspective as a 23 year old, I support innovation in education. Professor Ho Ngoc Dai, as a prominent figure in education reforming who had gone through the hard times in Vietnam, even consider children like a friend, once said &quot;if you consider them like a friend, then you can&#x27;t scold them&quot;. Unfortunately, majority of people in Vietnam and even ppl of my age still support this way of &quot;education&quot;, like wtf how can you say you beat them because you &quot;care&quot; about them, which is total hypocrisy. And then the &quot;backthen we got beaten and that gave us success&quot; mentality, which is totally survivorship bias because those people only got like good job with average income, maybe higher because backthen there were more opportunities due to booming economy in early 90s and 2000s. And if the method works then why is corruption and crime is still rampant in the country? 
 Of course this is a cultural issue, and I&#x27;m sure that many people may be triggered and even compare to the US or something. And yes, Vietnam is no doubt a part of sinosphere where collectivism and conservatism is widespread, people don&#x27;t change much and clings to Confucian values much like the way Islamists clings to orthodox view. So what is your thoughts ? Do you support change ?

                              <span>I own a couple of restaurants in HCMC, and I fired someone for so many reasons. On his way out, he stole my recipe book. He then opened a new restaurant, called it almost the same thing, and is selling my menu. I wouldn&#x27;t normally care, because my food is still better, but I keep getting messages from customers complaining about the food thinking it&#x27;s mine. 
 The name is different enough that it doesn&#x27;t violate any copyrights/trademarks, while the recipes are recipes I created myself, apparently there is no copyright on recipes? I&#x27;m told that there is nothing that can legally be done about it.
 So, is there anything legal that can be done about it?

                              <span>Hi all
 According to my guide book (Le Routard), plenty of excursions should be on offer in all the travel agencies to the several traditional hand craft villages around Hanoi. However, speaking to multiple of these agencies today, it appears most of them don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m talking about... Closest I got was a half day scooter tour to Bat Trang. I can find some info online, but also on here it&#x27;s rarely mentioned. 
 What I was looking/hoping for was a day-tour where you get to visit 3to4 of these villages and can experience/whitness the different craftsman in action.
 Is this maybe not a thing anymore? Is the info in my guide outdated? Has anyone on here ever visited (some of) these villages and was it worth it? Which ones would you recommend?
 Thanks! Grts from Hanoi 👋

                              <span>I am planning to visit Vietnam during the last week of November for 10 days with two friends from College. Our itinerary looks like Da Nang- Hoi An - Phong Nha - Hanoi- Halong Bay - Sapa. Planning to spend two days in sapa including catcat village. Are the villages really crowded during this time? Which are the villages which i should visit? And how will the weather be?

 I’ve been read the news about all the rain and flooding that’s happening and I’m wondering if anybody in the region can tell me if it’ll be safe to still do this.

                              <span>I plan to visit some remote regions (countryside, mountains, away from cities) of Vietnam in the nearby future. 
 I haven’t had a sip of tap water at all in SEA but have heard other people say they have without any consequences. 
 I’d like to know from you! 
 Do you drink tap water in Vietnam? If so, where do you get it from? Do you advise travelers to drink tap water in remote regions of Vietnam? 
 (For clarity, I have no problem buying water but I like to get honest opinions from locals and other seasoned travelers, and not the copy and paste blog posts of todays computer travelers). Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Saigon just a couple of weeks and my lungs feel like they&#x27;re on fire. 
 Walking down the street, the fumes from the thousands of motorbikes zooming by actually make me nauseous and I have to hold my breath while walking. I can even smell them from inside my apartment. I was planning to take a job here, but don&#x27;t think I can since this is such a big deal for me and affects my physical and mental health. (I also love walking, and this city is probably level 99 difficulty for pedestrians) 
 The noise pollution is pretty bad and I can&#x27;t sleep. There are bikes outside with loudspeakers blaring the same line over and over. I&#x27;ve stayed in four different apartments and every single one has had loud construction noise from 6am-10pm, every day. Even on Sunday. I was once woke up by hammering noise from inside another apartment at 2am! It seems inescapable. I noticed my ears are ringing when inside when it&#x27;s silent. Everything is so loud here. 
 That&#x27;s manageabke though. The worst for me is the air. Although it&#x27;s pretty good in general compared to hanoi, the traffic just overrides that. 
 When is the metro expected to be built? My daily transportation spending was lower in Singapore than in Saigon 🙁
 Is there any area with low traffic and good air quality? Has anyone else felt the bad effects of pollution since moving here?

                              <span>Hi everyone. 
 We are looking to do some ongoing volunteer work in Vietnam. Either with animals or children. Preferably in HCMC. 
 Does anyone have any recommendations? 
 I have searched Google and found a few places but we aren&#x27;t sure.

 Cơ mà tìm hiểu kỹ thì đợt trước e thấy mời một bà hoạ sĩ khác về chủ yếu là để cosplay (thông tin thu thập từ video có thể không hoàn chỉnh). Mà bà hoạ sĩ lần này mời về thì cũng nổi tiếng cái trào lưu “artist vs art”, trên page thì cũng nhấn mạnh cái này vài lần nên là e sợ lần này cũng chỉ cosplay thôi.
 Nói chung là e chưa đi fest AniAni bao giờ nên cũng chỉ phỏng đoán được dựa trên lượng thông tin ít ỏi có trên mạng thôi, mong những bác nào đã đi rồi chia sẻ cho e ít kinh nghiệm với

                              <span>Is there any tour groups that do the loop where you can use a quad bike rather than a scooter.
 My wife’s never rode a bike before and is a little bit sceptical about doing the loop however advised she’d do it if it was on a quad.
 She doesn’t want to do it with another rider and I don’t want to do it on a bike with her on the back of me as i think I’d enjoy it more myself on a bike.
 And we would prefer a group rather than self hiring.

                              <span>Hey guys, I was always wondering what people in socialist countries think of socialism or the concept of Marxism, I thought Vietnam would be the best to ask the question. 
 Obviously asking people in the r/Vietnam subreddit won&#x27;t get nearly correct answers as people here tend to be more influenced by Western English media but despite that I&#x27;m curious at least what the userbase here think/what they see in the country.
 Mainly I want to know it is because I am a Marxist and uphold countries like Vietnam because of how well they progressed and despite Doi Moi I see it as an effect of proletarian power. My country itself was heavily progressing from awful living conditions during socialism but unfortunately we had system change.
 TL;DR: How do you/the average Vietnamese feel about socialism (if there even is in Vietnam after Doi Moi) and Marxist theory?

                              <span>Hi guys, my name is Huy and I&#x27;m a music lover in Hanoi. I liked being on the stage so I&#x27;m attracted to the open mics scene in Hanoi. After a few months I&#x27;m now a regular in the open mic scene here. So I wanna make a list of coffee shops and pubs that host open mics night in Hanoi and the days they occur. If anyone has any questions, please give me a shout-out.
 Here are some notes:
  
Vietnamese open mics are often quite restraint and polite, there are a lot of shy wanna be singers, but it’s just a glorified stripped down acoustic karaoke session with pianos and acoustic guitars, so unless you bring your own stuff, it’s mostly just that to show your singing and instrumentalist skills
 Western open mics are quite fun, exuberant and chaotic due to the presence of a stage for electric instrum…</span>

I don&#x27;t speak Vietnamese and my doesn&#x27;t speak English, so most of the time I use Google Translate to carry out a conversation. Whenever my friend feels down and out, she always says &quot;tôi chán quá&quot;, which translates to &quot;I&#x27;m so bored&quot; in English. Did she really mean bored or should I take it as she feels depressed?

                              <span>I had a rather confusing encounter in Ho Chi Minh awhile back. I was walking around Ben Thanh market at around 0900hrs and went to stop at a store, I normally would say Hi or Xin Chao and proceed to ask the price of the item. 
 I noticed the sellers will ask how many item do you want to buy first instead of the price tag. I then ask again how much is it, she said something along the line “Morning price, first customer you don’t say that to me, I sell to you, how many do you want to buy?” 
 Since she didn’t answer my question, I told her I will come back and walk off. 
 Was I rude? Is there a cultural thing or is it rude to ask how much are the price of items here? 😅

                              <span>Hey Reddit, I&#x27;m currently backpacking across S. E. Asia and done the whole of Vietnam on a bike and loved it. I want to do it across the other countries I plan on visiting. Can I buy a motorbike in HCMC and take it through Cambodia, Laos and then Thailand as long as I get the blue card? Or would I be stopped at borders etc?

 do you have any tips for differentiating what to call people as to not seem rude or offend them?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 New account due to privacy reasons.
 I cannot wrap my head around VNese housing market. Used to live in Hanoi, HCM and Danang. Currently scouting Danang properties. Seen maybe over 100 various land/houses options within 5-20B range. And it just throws me away, as I cannot see any logic, behind pricing strategy.
 For example, I&#x27;ve came across several options such as 180sqm land cost 7B, and then 2 parallel streets further - 12B or so. In comparison, neighbourhood is the same, surrounding space/layout was similar too.
 The market seems very saturated. Tons of listings for bigger land (150sqm+). With huge price fluctuation (35M/sqm - 70M/sqm).
 My question is, how does one can buy any of this? With current mortgage rates (12-15% after excluding first few years) it&#x27;s a money burn going that route. Further, if I understand correctly, VNmese are not very encouraged to take this route, since rates most of the time we&#x27;re high (~6%), compared with West (1-2%).
 I can only see smaller properties to be in a hot market (3-5B), as it&#x27;s easier to deal via loans/mortgages, but going further, especially 8B+ route - it becomes a madness.
 Given the market in HCM, I&#x27;d see that there is no stop in price increase. I can feel now that it&#x27;s more of a stagnation period. I&#x27;d like to believe, that prices would come down, but at the same time - I feel that greed will be the driver for prices fueling up. However, question appears - how long can this last?
 What I guess, VNese take 7-9% fixed mortgage for 2 years, buy something and try to flip it. Is there any other way, they are able to afford and buy lands/houses for that much?
 What keeps me up at night is that there is just so many listings in Danang, prices seems to be inflated and yet, sellers aren&#x27;t willing to go much lower. However buyers market is definitely not here as well (for at least 8B+ listings).
 Would love to hear your experience and thoughts while navigating this market!

 Các nữ chiến binh thì check in ở những hồ bơi, những khách sạn, những khu du lịch...
 Tại sao có chung một phong cách như vậy nhưng mọi người vẫn bị thao túng tâm lý để từ đó mất tiền ngu như vậy nhỉ.

 What are some things I can ask for, like a real estate license or ID? What should the contract look like? 
 Thanks

                              <span>For anyone traveling to Vietnam, I can only say: the typical “Ninh Binh, Halong, Hơi Ăn, etc.” stops are great in their own right, but the mountainous northwest of the country can make you fall in love. 
 To me, there’s just no place like it. The Viet Bac, the Tay Bac, these places are so alive with culture and the scenery is stunning. 
 There isn’t always as much tourist infrastructure, but if you can ride a motorbike then get on it and go.
 October/November is a wonderful time to travel here. Avoid the rainy seasons due to very real risks of landslides.

 Saigon Garden Homestay 
 Khu phố 2 Tổ 33, KP2, Quận 12,
 Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam
 However, there were no reviews from any expats living in HCMC who stayed there as a weekend getaway or short breaks -- all the reviews were from tourists.
 Has someone lived here? Or, any other options. Any advice? Thanks. I&#x27;m posting 2 images of the property for ref:

 I found out Tet in 2024 will be exactly on my birthday, so I&#x27;m tempted to go celebrate both in VN.
 I could go for a week or so. What would the best dates be ? Before Tet or after, or a mix of two ?

I&#x27;ll be brief, explain a little about what direction I&#x27;m heading and my conditions on the ground in Hanoi. Me and my SO have extensive experiences in production/manufacturing/import/export and marketing. We both have business development skills and a high work ethic/drive. So in that sense we have our bases covered. I have been to Vietnam a few times and I have fallen in love with Hanoi. It feels as f the universe is pulling us here. Europe is going down the drain (I currently live in Sweden) and the US is in an even worse spot. I used to live in New York and LA and I never want to return. Thats our background. 
 Idea. Import/Export/Manufacturing either textiles or beauty. Thats the plan at least. I don&#x27;t think I have enough funds to venture …</span>

Is it rainy season in all of Vietnam or less in one area? I am from Florida so this I’m pretty used to. Is it raining all day or is it an hour then done for the day like here? Also is there any other areas to visit while in those bigger cities?

                              <span>hi! i&#x27;m hoping to visit soon &amp; have seen some photos of banh mi stalls that say &quot;vegetarian bread.&quot; I was wondering if vegetarian means something extra because isn&#x27;t bread typically vegetarian? is it more similar to vegan, like no milk or egg? (would be helpful for me if so as i am allergic to milk &amp; egg!)

                              <span>🇬🇧 EN Hi all, 
 As the title says, can I have some travel advice by someone in Da Nang or who has travelled in Da Nang today (since the Level 4 Disaster flood warning was issued today [for the first time in history apparently.]).
 We have a train into Da Nang tomorrow and a flight out of Da Nang two days after.
 We are wondering whether we need to make changes to our plans, or whether taking the risk to go is an okay decision.
 🇻🇳 VN Chào mọi người 
 Như tiêu đề đã nói, tôi có thể có một số lời khuyên du lịch của một người nào đó ở Đà Nẵng hoặc người đã đi du lịch ở Đà Nẵng ngày hôm nay (kể từ khi cảnh báo lũ lụt thiên tai cấp 4 được ban hành hôm nay [rõ ràng là lần đầu tiên trong lịch sử.]). 
 Chúng tôi có một chuyến tàu đến Đà Nẵng vào ngày mai và một chuyến bay ra khỏi Đà Nẵng hai ngày sau đó. 
 Chúng tôi đang tự hỏi liệu chúng tôi có cần thay đổi kế hoạch của mình hay không, hoặc liệu chấp nhận rủi ro để đi là một quyết định ổn. 
 ———
 EDIT: We’ve called some sources who state that the train station is less affected than the airport. Would anyone be able to validate this?
 EDIT: Chúng tôi đã gọi cho một số nguồn nói rằng nhà ga xe lửa ít bị ảnh hưởng hơn sân bay. Có ai có thể xác nhận điều này không?

                              <span>Hi there!
 My partner, toddler and I have so far spent time in Hanoi, Ninh Binh and Ha Long Bay. What an incredible country, we are having such a great time. We came knowing that it was the wet season but the day we got to Hue my partner came down with some sort of tummy bug... 
 We&#x27;re taking it easy for a couple of days and keeping the kiddo as entertained as possible but I&#x27;m now feeling a little concerned regarding our plans to travel to Da Nang on the 15th. 
 We are getting the train in and our hotel is very close to the beach in the center most part. 
 Judging from the news stories of flooding I can&#x27;t see how us turning up will be a good thing for ourselves, and the already struggling local services. 
 From a travel weary father of a toddler and partner of a sick girlfriend, please may I have some advice on how to proceed? 
 Our flight leaves from Ho Chi Minh on the evening of the 19th and we have a connecting flight from Da Nang that morning. 
 Many thanks

                              <span>Why are massage parlours/nail salons etc requesting for 5-star reviews in exchange for 10% or so discount on the bill at the end? I felt so pressured to rate it with the owner hovering over me and making sure I submit a review right in front of her. How odd. How can we trust which places are genuinely good with all these incentivised reviews?

 Da Nang, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh. These are the available routes for the airline with which I would fly. 
 Thank you very much!

 We live in HCMC, very close to the airport. My daughter (17), is studying online and she&#x27;s lonely 🙁 She has joined a gym but she&#x27;s wanting friends.
 Can anyone recommend any social groups or activities that she could join?

 I&#x27;m just looking to see if any veterans live in Vietnam. If so I know about the foreign medical program. Any other benefits in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hey guys 
 Before I came to Vietnam I heard a lot of people saying that people from Hanoi are unfriendly especially compared to the south.
 Now I’ve been in Vietnam for 2 years I’m living in Saigon but frequently go to Hanoi.
 Before I went to Hanoi the first time I was kinda worried that people are not as nice. But quite the contrary was the case.
 I had lots of great experiences in Hanoi and people were generally friendly.
 I often heard that people there are not smiling but I didn’t see that at all. When people see me they show me a peace sign ✌️ or wave and invite me for a cigarette or the tobacco bong or this self made alcohol ( I think it’s ginseng but idk for sure ) 
 Generally I found people very open towards me,maybe those bad experiences people talk about only happen in the city center?
 What I also find interesting is that people talk to me in full blown Vietnamese which I find refreshing. They don’t dumb down or change to English, they just talk and try to make me understand with sign language lol 😂.
 Everytime I’m in Hanoi I feel like my Vietnamese improves a lot.
 Anyways just wanted to share my experience in Hanoi.

                              <span>We booked a Vietnam Airline flight via Vexere App. Payment went through, and we received a booking code in the app. From booking train tickets with this app I was used to receiving an additional mail from the actual transport company,e.g. Vietnamese Railway etc. When this did not happen, I tried to look up our booked flight on the airline website using the booking code and last name. But no booking data could be found. Hotlines could not be reached today. Did anybody have the same problem and could maybe give an advice?

 I know that it’s technical possible from the law but I’ve never seen anyone that actually went through the process and achieved it.
 Is that just something that exist on paper but is not really done in real life?

 \&quot;I hope napalm stuck to your children\&quot;???
 &quot;Man upset that he has to pay 10.000vnd (the equivalent of $0.4) for parking, proceeds to say a bunch of vile things to a Vietnamese parking attendant.” His youtube channel, vlogging a Dead Horse, shows he’s still in VN, likely Ninh Binh. &quot; I read it on IG vietnamlocaladventures , and after watching this video, I was really angry at those horrible words. If this is a joke, he&#x27;s still a horrible person. No one jokes like that, it&#x27;s an insult to the guard and his family.
 In the video posted earlier, he drank beer then drove his motorbike here. That also basically violates traffic laws.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m planning to travel in Vietnam during January while working remotely. 
 I&#x27;m planning to do major cities, Hanoi, Halong bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An, Dalat, HCMC. Originally I was planning to start north and go all the way down to the south and fly out of HCMC. 
 But now I&#x27;m having doubts that this is the best route, weather wise and public transportation wise is it better to start south and make my way to the north or vice versa? 
 Any other tips welcomed :) 
 Thanks

                              <span>How long did it take you to get used to Roosters here in Vietnam? 
 I don’t mind them upon sunrise when they’re doing their thing but in the middle of the day on repeat for a few hours…what the hell is wrong with these creatures?! My neighbor has one and it goes wild at all times of the day!!
 Somebody fill me in…
 Is it because so many locals keep them in tiny cages and they just want to roam with the ladies? 
 I’m used to Roosters btw but some of these ones can be a total annoyance sometimes…

                              <span>At what point did you become a cô or chú? Growing up, I’m so used to calling everyone cô or chú and then I got surprised when teens/early 20s call me cô. To be fair, I am though at 31 😂 . This lady was doing my hair and she was 50 and I called her cô. She corrected me to call her chi so I started addressing people as anh/chi/em even if they’re much older. I look much younger though so people change how they address me once I tell them my age. I remember receiving lì xì and now I’m giving lì xì. Time flies, già rồi 🥲 
 PS - I’m viet kieu so there are a lot of nuances I’m still trying to understand

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t ask this question on r/HistoryWhatIf or any alternate history channel because most of them have no idea of European history. 
 Vietnam is a nation that is well-known for being extremely good at fighting wars, managing to gain independence from a strong nation like China, defeating the Mongols, and expanding down from the Red River Delta to the Mekong Delta, destroying Champa and Cambodia in the process. They also defeated the French, Americans, and Chinese forces which threatened their independence in the 20th century and managed to overthrow the Khmer Rouge which were battle-hardened troops, or so many internet historians say. 
 However, during the 18th-19th centuries, there were many wars the Vietnamese had against the Siamese over the control of Laos and Cambodia. While both sides had their victories and losses, the Vietnamese won more conflicts than the Siamese, which is weird since Laos was controlled by the Siamese while Cambodia was jointly-controlled, meaning that the Siamese gained more land in the war. 
 In 1800, Siam had a population of 4 million while Vietnam had a population of 7 million, almost 2 times more. 
 Without European colonialism, would Vietnam had conquered Siam like how they conquered Champa and the Mekong Delta? Or was Siam too strong of a kingdom to conquer? 
 Many Thais don&#x27;t know much about the Siamese-Vietnamese wars since it is skipped over in history classes. As I&#x27;m not a Vietnamese, I don&#x27;t know whether these wars are taught much in Vietnamese schools but I&#x27;m sure Vietnamese people are more knowledgable in their histories than Thais are in theirs. So I decided to ask the question here.

                              <span>I understand that most of the tourists coming to Vietnam, or SE Asia in general, just hop on a moped with little to no experience. Everyone tells me the same thing to just &quot;find a quiet road, fuck around for 30 minutes and you&#x27;ll be fine&quot;, but also these are the same people that end up hurting themselves or worse - someone else. 
 I don&#x27;t want a lecture on being a dumb foreigner causing accidents on mopeds because we don&#x27;t know how to ride them properly, I&#x27;m genuinely trying to ask what is a relatively ethical and normal way to learn to ride a moped here? How do you go from no prior experience to taking on the sea of bikes in the big city?
 Currently staying in Hanoi and feel a bit limited to using Grab to get everywhere, especially for the future when I would like to travel to more rural regions that don&#x27;t have the same accessibility without a bike. I obviously don&#x27;t want to learn in the traffic here but what would be a good place to go and &quot;fuck around&quot; without anyone going about? 
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I have been avoiding ice for 2 weeks while here, but eventually decided to drink a coffee at this chain of coffeeshops. I thought being a corporation they must be using ice not made out of tap water but I was wrong!
 Before this coffee I hadn&#x27;t had any issues while eating at food stalls everyday.

                              <span>So, I had a conversation with a Russian-Vietnamese (who was born in Russia). She was not okay with Vietnam staying neutral in the Ukraine - Russia war. While I really don&#x27;t appreciate her point of view, I can see why. After all, she is Russian and she wants people to support Russia. I also have seen the opposite story, where pro-West Vietnamese condemn Vietnam for staying neutral.
 The conversation, unpleasant as it was, was quite interesting. Which do diaspora Vietnamese community care more about, the interests of their native country or the interests of Vietnam ?
 For example, let&#x27;s say if Taiwan and China went to war, would you expect Vietnam to do something about it for the interest of Taiwan / China because you live in Taiwan / China ? Cause I really don&#x27;t see the point of Vietnam picking a side.
 Whenever you vote for your leader in your country, do you pick them for the interests of Vietnam ? When Trump got elected, my friends studying in US were absolutely terrified, because they were afraid of him imposing strict laws on immigrants, and that was not a good thing for Vietnamese who tried to work and study over there.

                              <span>Really strange, I needed a bit more than the normal cabin bag limit (I have a lot of electronics) and I looked in the booking phase and have a screen shot of them saying there is two pieces of luggage for business classic. But my ticket has been issued and it says 1 piece of luggage! This is totally weird for business class. (I am fine with the 32kg limit of checked baggage but I have two bags a 16kg and an 8kg bag.
 I have tried the US help line and it is just going to voice mail (even though it is within US hours.) is this normal? Any advice here?

 Can anyone find the Vietnamese version of this song? It must be really old and I don&#x27;t speak enough Vietnamese to know the lyrics. If this helps, I&#x27;m 100% sure they say heart &quot;trái tim&quot; in the Viet version. Probably made around 2010.

                              <span>If so, why?
 There is too many upsides to getting a Vietnamese passport, and NOT enough downsides.
 - The visa situation will get more stringent over time. Look at what happened post-COVID. One day, you will NOT be allowed to do infinite border runs, even on your 5-year visa exemption. Pre-COVID, it was VERY easy to renew your tourist visa inside the country. Post-COVID, much harder. Look at Thailand ... they charge $24K USD for their 5-year tourist visa (&quot;Thai elite visa&quot;)
 - Vietnam&#x27;s GDP rising.
 - Opening a business is easier. You don&#x27;t need a Vietnamese partner who owns 51% share of the company
 My prediction is, it will only get HARDER &amp; harder to get a Vietnamese passport as Vietnam&#x27;s GDP rises ... just look at Vietnam&#x27;s visa policy -- it&#x27;s already hard for non-ASEAN tourists to get a visa.

                              <span>Apparently, Vietnamese pronouns are really hard for many learners, so I decided to make that one of the first things I&#x27;d tackle in the language. Correct me if my explanation is wrong.
 Vietnamese has a few pronouns, of course. The pronoun for I is fairly common, for instance. However, it seems like Vietnamese likes to avoid using true first and second person pronouns, like other Asian languages. However, that means you need some other way to distinguish yourself and different people in conversations.
 Vietnamese chooses age and gender. You imagine that this person is a part of your family and choose a pronoun for you and a pronoun for them that agrees. For example, I would call myself big brother if I&#x27;m talking to a little girl and call her little sibling, and she would do that in reverse.
 Here&#x27;s a chart I made with all the different pronouns: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1WGMQL-_9XU14HV8i4OgvW0fiPY50n4OUcoNOS0q8U/edit?usp&#x3D;sharing
 I honestly think it&#x27;s a fascinating system. You get to show respect for the listener in more ways than tu/vous in French, but you also don&#x27;t have to change the entire sentence, like you would in Korean.

                              <span>I moved to a very multicultural city in a Western country and I&#x27;m in the process of finding a room to rent. I went check out this house this week and was shown around by this friendly vietnamese woman around my age in her 30s. There was a guy renovating the house who was also super friendly and chatty. I soon realized they were probably together despite the fact it was odd as he could pass as her dad. He&#x27;s a local, not an immigrant. She has a kid too.
 So days go by when I haven&#x27;t made up my mind so I send her a message asking if said room is still up for grabs. She says it&#x27;s been taken. But then proceeds to send me a message saying One thing I want to say to you is you are really handsome and have such a beautiful smile. This followed by a cheerful/smiley emoji.
 Well, what the heck?
 Isn&#x27;t this at best inappropriate considering she&#x27;s likely with this other guy? Am I missing a cultural difference?

                              <span>Hi, I went to the S-21 Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum today, in Cambodia. On the third floor, of I think building C or D, there was a piece of information that said.
 There was a person who in 1975 he was the director of the Vietnam war remnants museum. Like either he was the director, or some other high position. And then because of his expertise, he was chosen to be the director of the S-21 museum in the 1980s. 
 Does anyone know who this person was? I didnt take a picture of that blurb. But I remember it clearly

                              <span>Why in the actual fuck do they have kids write with purple pens in elementary school? What possible good could come of a 6 year old and a fucking pen? And why purple? Fuck me…it guarantees that homework looks like some fucking alien bled out all over the paper. Kids make mistakes. Shitloads of them. If only they had invented something you could write with and erase mistakes…
 Signed, a seriously annoyed parent. 
 Rant over.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I will soon be travelling to Vietnam, landing in Ho Chi Minh.
 As soon as I arrive I will need to get myself a Vietnamese SIM card and exchange some money. Is the airport the best place to do this or shall I wait and do it in town?
 Thanks for your help.
