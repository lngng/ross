I&#x27;m looking to understand more about the Vietnamese attitude towards sex (of any orientation) during this period. If you were living in the country at the time and would be happy to talk with me about your experiences, please let me know! Many thanks!

                              <span>So I heard you probably want to avoid traveling Vietnam during Tet, from what I read online Tet will take place from the 22nd-29th of Jan 2023, is this correct?
 If this is correct, will everything be back to normal already at February 1st? Or should I wait a little longer?
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>I am hoping to finally visit Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand to complete a trip I had originally planned in March 2020. I am vaccinated and boosted so entry requirements are fine, but what restrictions exist inside? Where do you have to wear masks? 
 What happens if I end up with Covid but without any symptoms beyond a common cold? Of course, I would stay in my hotel but would I be forced to go to some government location?
 Have many places closed permanently because of the harsh economic conditions? Any chance that borders will close again if there&#x27;s a new wave of infections or is the vaccine trusted enough?

 I’ve been wondering what songs would’ve sounded like in the ‘40s-‘50s before the French left, I was thinking of Pham Duy for example. Most 1950s songs I find are actually ‘70-‘90s covers.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently backpacking in Vietnam and am having a bit of a lady health issue. Either a yeast infection or some other similar sort of health infection! Sorry as I know this is a bit TMI, but I am wondering what to do/if any expats or locals in Vietnam have experience getting medication for this? I have used boric acid suppositories at home and they work great, so I&#x27;m specifically wondering if anyone has any knowledge if these are sold in Vietnam. 
 I&#x27;m currently in HCM, so I should have a lot of options I&#x27;m guessing, but so far have not had any luck.
 Any advice is appreciated!!!

 It featured some of the country&#x27;s best fighters, including reigning South East Asian and World Games Muay Thai champion Nguyễn Trần Duy Nhất!
 You can see a round-up of the event here.
 The final will be in Phu Quoc in January!

                              <span>Is there any sort of goth scene in Vietnam? Dive bars with live rock music or nightclubs that play spooky dance music? Underground shows?
 I&#x27;m particularly interested in Da Nang&#x27;s scene, since that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m living.
 So far, music wise all I&#x27;ve been able to find are the bands GoLim and Thoai 004. And pop punk stuff like 7uppercuts. What am I missing out on?

Sau đó ai cũng mệt mỏi, mình ko vượt qua được tổn thương và người đó cũng mệt mỏi với sự oán trách của mình. Sau đó vẫn chủ động muốn hàn gắn để sửa sai.

                              <span>Hey folks, I move in two weeks to Saigon for 1 month before I move over to Da Nang. (Need to do some paperwork in Ho Chi Minh, so I decided to give the city a try and stay there for the whole month)
 I am an international Expat, who works online.
 My question now is, which area do you guys recommend? I don&#x27;t need a crazy party scene arround me with many drunken tourist party people but I would appreciate to have access to gyms, nice local restaurants/street food, nice areas to go for a walk(best would be in some kind of an old town environment for the walk), modern apartment to live in(price does not really matter but don&#x27;t need a super fancy place).
 My girlfriends sister lives on the eastern part of district 2 - very close to district 9. So we thought about staying close to her place(lake view city) 
 Is this considered as a nice area and are there things to do? I think it&#x27;s a little far from the actual city center but maybe there are enough things to do.
 Thanks in advance for your opinions
 Cheers ✌🏻

 Like thrift shops, cool bars, vinyl record stores, etc.

 I(26M) have a CELTA certificate, a degree in Hospitality and Food Technology(hated hospitality for the lack of salary and the fact its basically manual labour) and now I am about to finish my Master in Computer Science(love problem solving and banging my head against shitty code that wont debug itself). And I plan on coming to HCMC as a teacher in Nov,2022.
 I have been following the jobs (Tech and Teaching) a lot since the past 2 years and it seems like the usual pay ranges from 400k/hr for English Centres to 700k/hr for Universities. Usually teachers manage about 80-100 hours a month which roughly averages to 40-50 million per month for inexeperienced ones(with the right credentials) or with certain correct skin tones (without…</span>

                              <span>Here goes nothing so no need to be judgmental/cynical/sarcastic because might delete later. Pretty much as the title says. Writing this after few failed attempts at dating.
 33M, US, educated, good career, healthy, decent looking, average body (6&#x27;1), pretty much everything normal. If anything, I don&#x27;t go out much and have high standards. I tried dating locally but nothing worked and seems like the dating scene is getting smaller as I get older. I had a long term relationship with Vietnamese girl in the past that didn&#x27;t work out, but I still think of her today as the one that got away(just fond memories). Also, have many close VN friends and I love the culture, hence this post. I tried dating apps, change location and talked to few girls from HCMC. I even traveled there to meet but felt like they weren&#x27;t sincere and not genuine.
 I read somewhere here that it&#x27;s more trustworthy if friends/colleagues make introductions but all of my friends are older and dont know any single ladies. So, anyone want to be my matchmaker? (obviously after knowing me)

                              <span>Hello,
 I land in Vietnam at 07:35 on Friday the 16th of December and depart at 20:55.
 I&#x27;m looking for an 10ish hour tour - Pick up at 08:30 returning to the airport for 19:00. There is me and my mother. I&#x27;d like to find someone who can take us on a tour of the city; see the key sites, someone who is willing to accompany us and our bags (secure parking will be a necessity) for the day.
 Pick up and drop off at the airport is a must. We&#x27;re not married to anything in particular in terms of what we see, we&#x27;d like a local expert to tell us what we shouldn&#x27;t miss as people with 10 hours to explore the city!
 Happy to pay (comparatively well compared to tour companies) for the right person who can put together an itinerary for us.
 Can anyone recommend someone? or volunteer themselves?

                              <span>Hello reddit,
 Me and my friends want to visit Vietnam in a couple of months. We were thinking of buying motorbikes in the north, and riding from Hanoi to Saigon. 
 The only thing is, my two friends don&#x27;t have a driving license (no car, scooter, or motor) and have none or barely any driving experience, not even in the European country I&#x27;m from.
 I do have a driving license for a car and a scooter for some years (not for a motorbike) and would consider myself an experienced/good driver, but even I am quite hesitant about riding a motorbike in Vietnam. The odds for two (if i count myself in three) totally inexperienced motorcycle drivers to get into any kind of accident when riding in Vietnam for a month seem higher than acceptable to me.
 On top of that I&#x27;m worried about my friends, I don&#x27;t want to see them in a serious accident in Vietnam, far away from home and without any insurance. 
 They just shrugg it off and say it&#x27;ll be alright and tell me I shouldn&#x27;t worry about it. They don&#x27;t seem to understand the risks. 
 Are my concerns justified? I know it&#x27;s almost impossible to go to Vietnam and not ride a motorbike, but I want them to at least understand the dangers and risks.

                              <span>I know funk and city-pop aren&#x27;t that popular in Vietnam. Many songs aren&#x27;t very funky, and have very structured and rigid melodies.
 The closest I&#x27;ve found is Berlin by Khoi Vu, Fever and Gap May by Wren Evans, and Het Thoi by Ngot. Even then, most of these are pop or other genres.
 ​
 When I search up Vietnamese funk, I can only find songs that don&#x27;t sound funky. 
 Here are some examples of city-pop or funk songs I&#x27;m looking for:
 Flyday Chinatown
 Funky Dealer

                              <span>Hey all. 
 Visiting Vietnam in the next few months and after some recommendations or personal experiences from people on here.
 Mostly like being away from overly touristy places, prefer chill places, meeting local people and getting stuck into the local food culture. Language barrier isn&#x27;t a problem. 
 Is the far Northwest a good place to head off on a motorbike trip, Lao Cai and that whole area Son La etc etc apart from Sapa? Possibly instead of Ha Giang and the more frequented areas. 
 Anyone got any experience in Hai Phong, Dong Hoi, Hue? Or just any other recommendations in general from the far north to the center (visa too short for entire country) 
 Thanks alot appreciate any responses :)

It seems that they&#x27;re all men and they try to get to know my basic imformation like my name, hometown, years old, or family. Some time they speak Vietnamese. They said they had my phone number by accident and wished us to be friend together. I wonder is that rude? Are they all foreigner? And what is the truth? I would be grateful with anyone could explain what happened with me.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m travelling to Vietnam next week from the UK and I&#x27;m trying to find out what the exchange rate is when taking money out an ATM. Here in England I get 25k Dong &#x3D; pound (from tescowhich is the best rate I can find). Do you get a more accurate exchange rate inside Vietnam from an ATM? it&#x27;s current about 28k to the pound. Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently living in the United States, and am looking to relocate to live in Vietnam for a couple of years to be closer to family. However, I am a difficult time looking for potential jobs in Vietnam as a Vietnamese American. I don&#x27;t expect to be making as much as I am in the US but looking something comparable. Thanks!
  
Are there high paying jobs for expat in Vietnam? (100k+ USD) 
 What&#x27;s the best way to search for jobs as an expat?

                              <span>I was born in Vietnam but have lived overseas for most of my life. Been trying to get back to my roots and understand the culture better by consuming more Vietnamese modern media.
 There&#x27;s a game show I watch called 2 Ngày 1 Đêm. Originally I enjoyed the show enough, but over the last few episodes, the show&#x27;s use of live animals just doesn&#x27;t sit quite right with me.
 First it was a game to capture duck. Then another game where they toss a whole bunch of mini crabs around to find special ones with numbers stuck to them. But the worst one was in the final episode where they were pulling this poor baby pig around, not with a proper pet harness, but just a piece of rope, then the poor thing got picked up and run around whilst screaming in distress. The sounds of his scream honestly stresses me out.
 Having grown up in Vietnam, I know we still have a long way to go in terms of animal rights, but I did not expect to see animal abuse on national television. Honestly I wonder what other people would think when seeing this on Vietnamese TV. This particular show originates from Korea. The Korean show has hundreds of episodes and animal abuse was never in any of them. How is it that the Vietnamese show cannot produce even 20 episodes without involving distressed live animals, do the producers lack creativity that badly? 😔

                              <span>Hi All! This is my first post here.
 I am going to be in Vietnam for a month, starting November 2. I am going to be based in HCMC, but I will be free to move around the country. I have received my fourth dose of COIVD vaccine, and am happy to mask up and to practise social distancing in my home country of Canada, but I am curious to know what people in Vietnam are currently doing regarding COVID protocols. In my part of Canada, it seems many people are now throwing caution to the winds re: COVID. Is the same happening in Vietnam?

 I wanted to ask if there is any public edition (including text version) of Cards Against Humanity card board game: https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/ in Vietnamese?
 Anyone can download template and add their own text, so I was just wondering if anyone tried to create VN version of this game, thanks.

                              <span>Last time I visited VN was during Tet in 2020, and even though it shut down Hanoi for a day (really weird to walk around the old quarter and it was dead) it was a very cool experience to see the festivities and everything going on in Saigon to celebrate.
 This time we&#x27;ll be landing on Christmas day in Hanoi (late at night of course), and we will in Saigon for International New Years eve and day. What should we expect?, are there celebrations?, are day trips still happening? (cu chi tunnels tour type things).
 TIA and looking forward to coming back!!

                              <span>Hi all! My friend and I are visiting Hanoi and HCM some time early to mid December. We understand HCM’s a more comfortable coolish warm weather. For Hanoi, we’ve been reading up and watching videos but we are still quite confused about the weather and is unsure of what to prepare in terms of wear because we’ve read and seen people wearing anything from shorts to padded jackets… 😂
 We understand that the weather can be quite volatile and thus layering is key, but we’d just like to get some sense of what the weather is like in both cities, and whether Hanoi especially requires anything even remotely close to a padded jacket? 
 For context, we come from a tropical climate within SEA! 
 Many thanks! :)

                              <span>While riding all over Vietnam from South to North I would always come across a wedding party, in rural areas, there would be a big tent on the side of the road that would extend out onto one lane of the road. The first time I saw this caught me by surprise as I rode past and suddenly got hit with sonic waves and my ear drums felt like they were about to explode. I almost go blown off my bike. I came across 3 weddings that day so I knew what I was in for. But I have always wondered, why do the have speakers at a wedding reception the Size of a house that are turned up to 100% with 100 guests inside drinking like there is no tomorrow. I&#x27;m sure they are all yelling. Mot Hai Ba Yooooooo.... Is there a reason behind having the big ass sound system that triggers the earthquake richter scale monitors all over Vn.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in Vietnam for the first time, with my partner.
 We are in Hoi An currently.
 I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not really enjoying it today.
 It&#x27;s way too muggy and hot, the river and city is dirty as hell.
 And there&#x27;s so many scammers and people trying to hustle you.
 There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much to do, and everywhere we have eaten (trying all the top rated places) has been dissapointing.
 What is there to do here really? Drink warm beer, inhale pollution and look at a dirty river? Am I missing something? 
 Anyone have any suggestions please.
 Edit. People asking why I didn&#x27;t plan this properly, this was a last minute change of plans as Japan still didn&#x27;t ease restrictions when we made the switch (they eased restrictions literally 2 days after we changed flights and bookings)

                              <span>My baby boy puppy just died today and we had him cremated. I was wondering what is acceptable in regards to vietnamese views in regards to this subject. 
 Is it ok to keep the ashes in your home? Would buddhist temples bless the remains?
 I asked my mom and sisters but they said they usually dont talk about things like this at the temple or not really sure. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>My boyfriend just spent a month out there in and around HCMC and he really wanted to bring home one of the green grab jackets, but never came across anyone that had one he could buy - he found the helmets but not the jacket :(
 Does anyone know how I could track one down to buy and have sent to the US? I&#x27;d love to surprise him with it
 (If anyone is visiting and can get their hands on one to bring back to the US and ship to me let me know!)

                              <span>It all started when my young brother were in hospital and I visit my young bro with my mom in an old, overcrowded kid hospital near Tan Mai province. After that, my young bro were out of hospital and go home with us, and that’s how problems begins to show up. My mom and dad are the one that hit first, got more coughing and loosing voice (only my dad) and that’s somehow hits me and the entire family with symptoms like fever, headache, muscle pain, eye pain, coughing and puke. Not only my family, even the teachers that I have known in Bien Hoa City were got Covid or got sick. I just don’t know what diseases that caused my whole family to be sick but things were started to get dire when the cases were spreading wild in HCM city. I just don’t know if I got some health to study and doing exam tomorrow but I’m thinking that it’s getting worst.

                              <span>Can anyone suggest how come Francisco de Pina was never granted Honorary citizen of Vietnam?
 After all, coming up with a modern alphabet for a language is no walk in the park.
 Although, Vietnam doesn&#x27;t usually make foreigners citizen of Vietnam, there has been instances where Foreigners have been granted Citizenship:
 https://vietnamnet.vn/en/the-first-foreigner-granted-vietnamese-citizenship-E66920.html
 Or title of &#x27;honorary citizen of vietnam&#x27;:
 https://vovworld.vn/en-US/news/alexandre-yersin-awarded-posthumous-title-of-honorary-citizen-of-vietnam-272608.vov
 Or &#x27;The honorary Citizen of the Capital City&#x27;:
 https://vovworld.vn/en-US/news/former-vietnamrussia-friendship-organization-president-hanoi-is-always-in-my-heart-277455.vov
 Seems odd that Francisco de Pina hasn&#x27;t been awarded any of these.

                              <span>Hi :)
 I&#x27;ll be visiting Vietnam in November. We are planning on travelling from HCMC to Phnom Penh and visiting the Mekong Delta. However I can&#x27;t find any info about 3 or 4 day tours starting in HCMC and ending in Cambodia, that are not luxury cruises which cost 1000+ $ per person. Do you know any websites where I can book those tours? Or do you have any other tips to plan my trip in Mekong Delta?
 Thanks very much! :)

 First of all, I am fully aware of the fact that some East Asian countries like South Korea, Japan have unwritten strict dress codes and it is generally not acceptable for women to wear very short jeans shorts that reveal your legs too much. Its also not accepted if your buttcheeks are visible. As far as I know, women dress very modestly in South Korea and Japan(even during hot summers) to practice modesty. Would u say Vietnam is similar to South Korea and Japan in that regards? Will I stand out a lot amongst the crowd if I wear jeans shorts that are sho…</span>

                              <span>My company is thinking about sending me to Vietnam a few times a year for a project, and rather than bringing my US Verizon number, it was recommended that I get a prepaid Vietnam SIM (such as Viettel, Vietnamobile, etc), keep topping up regularly to keep the number active (so I don&#x27;t have to buy a new one everytime). I&#x27;ve done this successfully when I was stationed in Singapore. 
 Question is, is it possible to have a Viettel (or other VN carriers) SIM registered and shipped overseas (so that I have it prior to my trip), as well as international roaming activated (just so I can receive SMS while overseas)? 
 Thx!

                              <span>Hello--- I&#x27;m a Việt Kiều and I&#x27;ve been researching folk religion partially for a story I want to write. I came across an article (offroadvietnam.com/vietnam-info/customs-and-rites/funerals) about burials that mentioned this: 
 &quot;Sometimes, coffins are temporarily buried in the gardens to discourage thieves from robbing the valuables inside. In the case of young virgin girls, the burial place is often nearby the home so that it can be watched. Some rural people believe that the head of a virgin girl is very valuable and may be conserved and turned into the most powerful and omnipotent talisman through special ceremonies. Persons who have the talisman are believed to be omnipotent and invulnerable.&quot; 
 I found that really intriguing but couldn&#x27;t find anything else referencing that belief online. Has anyone heard of this, or anything related? And are there any keywords that might help me research further? I&#x27;m also curious what they mean by &#x27;rural people&#x27; here...
 Cảm ơn!

 It could be anything from just feeling like it, to having someone recommend it to them or want to see the view, etc... Any answers are greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi everyone! So my husband and I want to travel to Vietnam the next summer but the visa process is very stressful and we are unsure what websites to trust. We are Omani passport holders currently in Canada and we were wondering if Go Viet Travel is a legit website. Has anyone used it before? Also what other websites do you recommend? We are not eligible for an e-visa and the embassy near us says they&#x27;re having some technical issues with online applications, so I&#x27;d appreciate any help. Thank you all!

 I also need to find restaurants that could accommodate a group this large without too much trouble. Most of my favorites could not handle that capacity all at once.
 I would really appreciate your recommendations! Thanks so much.

 I live in the United States, but I want to plan a 6 month trip to Vietnam to learn the language and explore the country. My parents are Vietnamese, but I don&#x27;t know how to read, write, or speak Vietnamese. I can understand the Southern dialect about 60% of the time.

                              <span>Hi all! Finally decided to take a vacation for a few days and booked a 6 day trip to Hanoi. I have been to Ho Chi Minh and I really enjoyed it, and friends of mine have told me Hanoi is even better! So I am thrilled to visit but also don&#x27;t know what I should be seeing, eating, experiencing...
 I love culture, good food, good coffee, walking around and sightseeing, an occasional good cocktail, and enjoy the special, unique things that every city has to offer. I will be staying in Old Town, if that helps, but I don&#x27;t mind booking a taxi or any other type of transportation. A friend even recommended I visit Laos from there, for a day or two, which I&#x27;m open to doing.
 Any recommendations are very much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in and out of vn for many years since graduating university and working for a couple of large international companies. So I&#x27;ve lived in a bubble of corporate housing, spending accounts, and HR departments that took care of everything.
 That said, I&#x27;ve now another, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s more of a necessity than an opportunity, to relocate back again indefinitely, but out of the corporate world, 100% on my own.
 Visa and housing are all taken care of, so no issues there. But I&#x27;m more interested in the small things that people had found useful when keeping a significant presence and residence in the US but coming to vn indefinitely.
 Mainly how to effectively bank? Id like to leave all assets in the us with US banks and brokerages and just move funds to vn as needed. I generate my income in USD outside of vn and anticipate keeping it like that. But no doubt will need to bring in large amount of cash to settle down. 
 Which banks work better than others for those with foreign US assets? What credit cards are most efficient/effective?
 Most other aspects are square, but as I said I was living in a financial bubble I didn&#x27;t need to worry about.
 Advice?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have some mesterolone which is a weak steroid used to help alleviate the symptoms of low testosterone. It&#x27;s just a tablet so not injectables or anything. However, I don&#x27;t have a prescription. Will the Vietnamese customs be bothered about me taking in a couple weeks supply? What will happen if they find them? I&#x27;ve heard about extremely strict punishments for taking certain drugs in but it seems that is only for drugs of abuse. I don&#x27;t want to risk ending up in prison!
 Thank you!

                              <span>I’m currently traveling through Vietnam this month with my wife. We are in Ninh binh right now and wanting to go to phong Nha National park, da Nang, hue, da lat but a bunch of other travelers have said to avoid it because of flooding and rain. Any advice? How bad is it out there? Thanks in advance

                              <span>We just had a argument, my bf is not Vietnamese, we are living together in Europe, we have been together for almost 1 year but we have had a lot of fights.
 This time, my bf will go to his country to visit his family for a week, i will stay here, i was talking to him that i might go to my best friend house to have diner, and suddenly he asked me that: “with her boyfriend too? And you gonna cook for him too?”. Idk how he can think like that, in Vietnamese culture, go to friend house and help them cooking is very normal, and obviously it’s theirs house, of course her boyfriend will be there too, and i used to do it very usually even before I meet my boyfriend.
 He got so mad and he keeps repeating that : “why do you want to go to her house and cook for her boyfriend? Her boyfriend?”.
 He doe…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I am a second-generation viet kieu born in Belgium
 My parents fled Vietnam and settled in Belgium where I was born.
 They both lost their vietnamese citizenship from what I know and are now belgian citizens.
 For my part, I was born and lived in Belgium until recently.
 I speak vietnamese good enough to live in Vietnam on my own and have a vietnamese name.
 ​
 I recently decided to move to Vietnam to live here.
 I am under a 5-year visa exemption and still work remotely for a Belgian company (no work visa then).
 I am considering my options to obtain vietnamese citizenship to settle here for good in the future.
 The dual citizenship is possible from what I know.
 ​
 From what I could find, the easiest way would be to ask one of my parent to regain its vietnamese citizenship first so I can apply as the child of a vietnamese citizen.
 Is there any other solution?
 It is not that they are not willing to do it but since it is my personal decision, I do not want to force them to take the decision to regain citizenship for me.
 Thanks for reading me.

                              <span>Hi! I’m visiting Vietnam looking for a place to bring a gift back from Vietnam for a female family friend. The two cities I’ll be visiting next are Saigon &amp; Nha Trang. This friend is very well off and doesn’t really like tacky items or fakes (knockoffs for name brands). Her style is more classy (eg. pearl jewelry). She doesn’t care about brand names either, so it doesn’t matter about the price.
 I’m trying to find something locally made that’s of decent quality and not tacky - a shawl / scarf, jewelry, etc. that can fit in a suitcase. Any suggestions of stores and / or items? I was initially thinking an ao dai, but I heard these are better when tailored to a person. 
 Thank you for the help :)

                              <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m new to VN, just bought scooter on FB but I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;s stolen? Didn&#x27;t even occur to me -- I feel so horrible &amp; guilty. I took blue crd from seller...yes ik I should&#x27;ve checked it first, but I&#x27;m naive I guess -- so it&#x27;s got the VNese owner&#x27;s info on it. Wht should I do? If I report it, will the bike return to originl owner? If I keep it, will I get in big trouble? I did shell out good money, just weighing out every option. Thx for reply

                              <span>Hey guys! We’re travelling from Phong Nha to Ninh Binh tomorrow by motorbike, but find the drive a bit too far. So, was wondering what would be a good place to stop in between?
 We were thinking of Vinh, but aren’t too sure about it. 
 Are there different places, maybe a bit off the beaten path, halfway from Phong Nha to Ninh Binh maybe? Or would you recommend just to stay in Vinh?

                              <span>It&#x27;s a Vans style vietnamese sneakers brand. &quot;Designed in Saigon, made in Vietnam&quot;. It&#x27;s dirt cheap, with basic sneakers costing 20USD only !
 ​
 And... They do have big sizes for westerners. I wear 45,5 EU and 45EU was fine, they have up to 46EU with every sizes available in the store I went !
 ​
 Quality wise it&#x27;s better than Vans, the sole is much better.
 I found this by surprise down the street is HCMC, they have several stores there. I highly recommend you checking out. Will definitely buy more pairs to bring back in Europe also.
 ​
 ​
 I don&#x27;t have any affiliation with them but I found that it&#x27;s so cool to buy local brands here, and didn&#x27;t saw any post here or in other expat&#x27; communities talking about this brand, so thought it was worth sharing with you.

 If you know other nice vietnamese brands worth checking out it would be nice if you can share it in the comment section.

                              <span>Not a Karen post! I just wonder if anyone else noticed something similar. 
 I’ve traveled between HCM and Hanoi a lot this summer and have never had any problems with the food, however yesterday was awful at multiple places. I wonder if there is some airport-wide issue that’s happened recently or if yesterday was just a lot of bad luck. 
 Many VN airports have a Lucky Star Cafe and I usually get a sandwich from there. They have the sandwiches on display in a window and you pick one, they take it out and heat it, and hand it over. At Hanoi airport yesterday, I looked at one cafe and all the meat looked super dried out, as if it had been sitting at room temp for hours, or even more than a day. All the meat on all the sandwiches looked like that. I decided to try another location of Lucky Star — same thing: dry, discolored looking meat. I decided to order Burger King instead because it was right next to me and because at least that food is cooked when you order it. 
 The BK fried chicken sandwich was utter shite! It looked like it had been fried at too high of a temperature for not a long time. It looked like a burned brick on the outside and the inside was cold mush. I had to spit it out as soon as I took a bite and I just left. I didn’t even want to try anything else. I am aware I should not have high quality expectations for fast food but it should at least be edible. 
 I got a bottle of water from a third Lucky Star location and all the sandwiches there looked the same as the first two. I just decided not to try anything else at the airport. 
 I know this could be a huge coincidence, but maybe there is a wider issue? Is there some electricity issue fucking with the food equipment? Has there been so little traffic that they haven’t moved their products? This is the only time I’ve had bad food at the airport so it just seemed weird that four different places had food issues. What do you think?

 Some context: We worked for a fishing company together. Him and I would basically fly off a boat and pass off coordinates to the boat we were on whenever we saw large schools of tuna fish. This was basically daily for a year. But he speaks very limited English, good Chinese, and native Vietnamese. I speak vocational Chinese, zero Vietnamese, and native English. Nonetheless, we got along great. We trusted each other enough to venture thousands of miles away from land and 40 miles away from our boat in a small aircraft. When we got back I would relax and he would continue to work his ass off because I am from privilege and he is not. He has a 3 year contract away from his family. I have a 1 year contract.…</span>

Are there conventions to meet with distributors? Google keeps showing me consultants but I’d like to be on the ground and involved.
 Anybody have any Vietnam business experience they’d like to share? 
 Sorry if this is a dumb question.

                              <span>I&#x27;m thinking about doing one of the cave tours in Vietnam this year. Went on the Oxalis website and was spoiled for choice. Everything looks incredible. Hang En, Hang Tien, Hang Va, Tu Lan... Which have you gone on and what were your experiences? 
 Thinking about either doing the Hang Va Expedition or Wild Tu Lan Cave Explorer. Any suggestions on which might be better/best and why? I&#x27;m in shape and have lots of hiking experience so expedition length shouldn&#x27;t be a huge issue. TIA &amp; cheers!

 Hãy coi chừng! Điều này đang được các trường ở Việt Nam bàn tán như một trò lừa đảo làm giàu nhanh chóng. Người bạn của tôi vừa mất tiền tiết kiệm. Có ai biết thêm bất cứ điều gì về lừa đảo này? Tìm kiếm thêm thông tin để chuyển cho cảnh sát. Cảm ơn bạn!!

                              <span>So I only noticed this while living abroad. I don&#x27;t think I have ever known any Vietnamese that are scared of spiders. Sure there are people who are afraid of cockroaches, roaches or even bugs, but I tried to ask all my friends, even ladies, nobody is afraid of spiders.
 But when I was abroad, so many people are scared of them, to the point of yelling, including men (sorry I don&#x27;t mean to judge, I myself hate other bugs too). Of course there are some who will take care of the problem, but when I was there, I was the go-to person to take care of relocating them (I hate killing them because I like that they eat bugs but my wife wants me to kill them all the time 😂)
 So... is it true that generally we Vietnamese are not afraid of spiders? Why?

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m learning Vietnamese because I&#x27;m going there to study in January. I use duolingo to learn vocabulary and else but I also need practice, and I can&#x27;t find any text for beginner or content with subtitles. I found BL but they don&#x27;t have subtitles, and Vietnamese is hard to grasp at the beginning, without any writen support. Do you know where I could find some content with subtitles ? There is nothing on Netflix too.

However, i noted that I am required to have a Vietnam phone number for verification before i can do any purchasing.
 Is there any way I can make a purchase without the Vietnam phone number? 
 Item I&#x27;m buying is an simple Ao Dai for guy as I will be having a Vietnam Theme party on the night that I arrive in Hanoi and thought of wearing the Ao Dai as costume. Not sure how common such shops are in Hanoi and the price range of male Ao Dai being sold around the area. Hence decided to shop via Shopee.
 Anyone can help?

                              <span>I’m getting married next year and I want to get some custom ao dai made in Vietnam for myself and wedding party which are affordable and not hundreds of dollars like the US. Based on my past experiences, it seems like the only way to get the best deals is by having relatives order and ship it to you. I’m just wondering if there are any shops in Vietnam that work with overseas brides and how the shipping works. Again, with past experiences, I’m afraid that my packages will get intercepted.

I have a phone that supports esim but all the esim apps and resellers offer lackluster esim plans or they&#x27;re overpriced compared to what I see are available once on the ground in Vietnam. 
 Does anyone know where I can buy a reasonably priced esim? I tried looking for a way to buy directly from Viettel but I couldn&#x27;t figure it out.
 Thanks for any insights or help.

 Then I came across the FULRO group which in French stands for &quot;Front unifié de lutte des races opprimées&quot; or in English &quot;United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races&quot;. From what I have read about FULRO is that they are considered to be a collation of other political ethnic minorities groups, most of them were Chams Hindus and Muslims, Montagnards Christians, and Buddhist Khmer Krom. FULRO was response during the Vietnam War (1964 when America decide to but more military aid to South Vietnam) where the minority&#x27;s groups were feared that both Communist North and Capitalist South gover…</span>

                              <span>My significant other is the daughter of Vietnamese parents that moved to Japan as refugees. The problem is: even though she was born and raised in Japan, Japan does not recognize her as a citizen. The only way for her to receive citizenship in Japan is to work for 3+ years as an office lady and pay the government X amount of taxes. 
 We aren&#x27;t doing that, and recently I received a job in VN.
 Because she doesn&#x27;t have a passport or citizenship anywhere in the world, her visa status will likely be a little difficult to navigate (she has a special visa that allows her to visit Vietnam for 6 month periods but requires her to return to Japan). 
 Has anyone here been in a similar situation? 
 She knows that she won&#x27;t apply for Japanese citizenship (and has little desire to now). So, how difficult would it be for her to apply for Vietnamese citizenship? 
 She speaks Vietnamese fluently and has a Vietnamese name, if that makes a difference.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Can anyone recommend how I spend 2 weeks from South to North. There are way too many cool locations. I will be remote working for 1 week. I don&#x27;t really want to use trains much. The VIP bus I don&#x27;t mind and flying I&#x27;m cool with.
 So far thinking 
 2 days in HCMC ??? 7 days in Hanoi to see Halong Bay and try and do 1 trip to somewhere cool in the north
 I guess there&#x27;s a gap after HCMC but any help would be great thank you.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I booked some internal flights in Vietnam via GoToGate, where they asked me to put &quot;First and Middle Name&quot; in one field, and Last Name in another field.
 I put in the names as instructed, but now when trying to check my booking via VietJet Air&#x27;s website when it requested &quot;Middle and Given Name,&quot; I was only able to actually check my booking after flipping it around as &quot;First and Middle Name,&quot; and the VietJet Air website now lists the name as &quot;LAST NAME FIRST NAME MIDDLE NAME.&quot;
 The issue is I&#x27;ve booked these tickets on the behalf of others, who are Vietnamese citizens, and the names on their passports of course list it as &quot;Last Name Middle Name First Name&quot;, which is different from what&#x27;s on their tickets. Granted, the GoToGate e-ticket also instructs everyone to print the document out where it also has their name printed as LAST NAME/FIRST NAME MIDDLE NAME to bring with them to the airport. Does anyone know/have experience with this if this will cause any issues when receiving their boarding pass at the airport and boarding the plane?

 What sort of digital payment wallet is the most widely accepted?
 Also, is there a platform to convert USD over to VND, or is this something I would really need to go to a bank for? 
 Thanks for any pointers you might have!

                              <span>How difficult is it to navigate the ha giang loop/ northern vietnam in general? Will i need to have my phone navigation out at all times or are there few roads that are easy to follow without a high risk to get lost?
 Is riding from Hanoi to Sa Pa then doing the Ha Giang loop then to Cao Bang then back to Hanoi a good decision, or will it be a problem for some reason?
 How many CCs bike can i hire at most with just a car license
 How much roughly will it cost to rent a motorbike for 2 weeks?
 I have some experience riding a motorbike btw
 Also, if you have any other tips regarding riding in north vietnam, please feel free to share :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Halongbaytours.com aka Blue Dragon tours is a scammy tour agency. I booked a tour with the understanding that I can cancel before 30 days and get a full refund. Something came up and I requested cancellation. They have basically ghosted me and didn’t refund my deposit. Luckily I can dispute with my credit card company.
 Companies like these give all Vietnamese tour operators a bad name. I’m surprised that they don’t realize the Internet will amplify bad business practices. They will lose more future business than its worth a small deposit in the grand scheme of things.
 For anyone who book tours, please find a local tour operator on Facebook instead of using any online website Unless it’s a legit International site. Don’t pay any deposit, only pay when you get there.

                              <span>&#x27;Sup guys, so today my flight is departing to Hanoi. I am looking forward to it like crazy. There was one bad thing however today, as I couldn&#x27;t find my driver license anywhere. Which baffles me because I always have it on me in the same card holder. But yeah it&#x27;s gone and that is a real bummer because I was looking forward to renting a scooter or motor to drive around the area. I found a travel blog on the internet however saying that to rent a 50cc scooter you don&#x27;t necesarilly need to show/have a license. The last time I rented one of those in Indonesia it was able to go up to 80 km/hour so that is fine for my needs. So I wanted to check here. Do you have an idea if it is possible to do this without a license? (Just to be clear btw, I do have a license and a lot of experience driving, I just don&#x27;t have the license itself on me while traveling because I didnt have time to get a new card today. )

                              <span>I’ll (20M) be visiting Vietnam for the first time in January with my GF (20F). We are from the US. We’ll be flying into HCMC, where we’ll stay for around a month and then go to Hanoi. I am musician and I write, record and produce my own music. I mainly play Rock and Roll/Indie, but love all types of music. I’ll be bringing a few microphones and equipment to record music, I am trying to gain experience in working with other musicians and making new connections, so if you have a project or a group, I’d love to record it. I’d also love to just talk about music too! I am not sure what the music scene looks like in Vietnam, so any insight into what kind of music and where I can find local music would be helpful. Thanks!

                              <span>My husband and I just finished up three wonderful weeks in Vietnam, I already can&#x27;t wait to go back. However, something weird happened to us while we were in Hanoi, twice two different men tried to grab at my husband&#x27;s shoes. My husband kicked at their hands and they tried to grab his shoes multiple times while muttering something we couldn&#x27;t understand. We managed to get away both times, but I was wondering what would have happened if they had managed to actually get a hold of his shoes? My husband thought they were trying to glue something to his shoe and then have him pay to get it off. Any idea what was going on?

                              <span>I want to do a quick 30 minute portrait photo shoot put in public with my girlfriend in the city. If I Google in English &quot;photographer in hcm&quot; I get a lot of English speaking priced photographers, charging like 350 usd for a 30 minute shoot. What is the best way to find local prices photographers here in Saigon?

                              <span>Hello everyone ! I’m travelling with my girlfriend all over Vietnam and we are currently in Da Nang. There is a typhoon coming tomorrow and we are wondering where should we go because the weather looks bad in the south as well. We did Hanoi and Halong Bay already, we were wondering if Sapa was worth the trip, and otherwise if you have some recommandations for us ?
 Thank you very much !

                              <span>I live in the US. I&#x27;ve met a wonderful Vietnamese woman this year. I am formally visiting her in December. We want to do a K1 visa, marry in the states, but have the ceremony in Vietnam. From what I&#x27;ve been reading so far, it seems getting a K1 will take a long time. Has anyone gone through a situation similar to this that could give me some suggestions?

They didn&#x27;t understand what I said and was like what.. and told me I need to say &quot;vị&quot; and &quot;mùi&quot; is only for nước hoa. I know &quot;mùi&quot; means scent/smell but I swear I heard it being used when talking about flavors before like &quot;bánh kem mùi gì ngon&quot; or &quot;thôi ăn múi sầu riêng đi&quot; It could be I&#x27;m mixing up my Vietnamese and remembering it wrong. Or it&#x27;s a region thing, something nguoi nam say. Does any ng nam use the word &quot;mùi&quot; for flavor?

 And for those who don&#x27;t know - please dont try it. This sport requires lots of luck and special skills.
 Especially if you don&#x27;t want to tear your shoes, tear your clothes &#x3D;))) Dogs can bite your shoes even when you are at home, let alone when going out and poke the neighbor&#x27;s dog, right? Haha.
 And if your shoes are bitten and torn, you can bring them to a shoe care store near you to have them sewn.

                              <span>Good morning from America!
 I was recently accepted for a very well paid internship in Can Tho! I&#x27;m excited for it, however I wanted to ask what is there to do on free time around the area? Friends from HCMC told me it&#x27;s kinda a sleepy town and there isn&#x27;t much to do. Also general advice on best sim for international calling to USA? Sorry if this is an often repeated question but I would appreciate the help!

                              <span>I&#x27;m an English 27 y/o female living in London. I have a 1st class Fine Art degree and currently studying a PGCE in secondary art and design (post graduate that qualifies me to teach full British GCSE art and design curriculum and A-level). I have teaching experience in art and geography. I recently started a beginners Vietnamese course with SOAS. 
 I was preparing to move to Vietnam to teach English and COVID hit, which pressed me to study my post grad and become an art teacher.
 I want to live the rest of my 20s and onwards in a beautiful exciting country, to immerse myself in a new culture, learn a new language, to grow and truly live. I want to really take some time to move to a country to study to make my best attempt at learning the language, meeting new people and also to rent a studio to have the time to develop my art practice. 
 Here in UK I&#x27;m seasonally depressed 6 months of the year, overworked to afford to get by and uninspired and to be honest I&#x27;ve always felt this way about life here. 
 The reason I chose to study to become an art teacher is in some desperate hope that I might be able to utilise these skills and find work in an international school abroad as a British curriculum art teacher or gain a residency visa back to Australia (closer to Vietnam at least). Don&#x27;t get me wrong I do love working with young people.
 Working as an art teacher in London is something like £35k a year. But honestly I&#x27;d take a sickening pay cut to move and have more time to truly live. International schools in vn seem few and far between that need art teachers. I would obviously very much love to keep progressing with my art related career, as it&#x27;s my specialism and love but I would consider teaching English if It means I have more time off and have enough money to work on my art and take Vietnamese lessons. 
 Thoughts anyone? What kinds of jobs/hours/pay What do you think my prospects will look like if I move to Vietnam. 🇻🇳🍵

                              <span>As the title says, what is the best officially recognized Vietnamese language course that is available in Hanoi?
 a bit of backstory: In 2020 I decided to change careers and return to university. I am doing it all online through a university that is outside of Vietnam. 2021 I got an online job that allowed me to get through covid times. My employment contract there ends at the end of January 2023.
 Having worked from home for the last two years, my Vietnamese skills have diminished a lot, and they weren&#x27;t that good to begin with. 
 I have a year until my university degree is finished and I then plan to reenter the workforce, but until then, I have two options: return to my extremely expensive home country where I will need to finish my studies and work at the same time, due to cost of living OR continue my online studies here while also studying Vietnamese.
 My online studies are in a field that I am already quite knowledgeable in, so I am kind of bored to be honest. And on top of that, I have a lot of free time. So I would much prefer to stay here and study Vietnamese and live off of the savings for a year before returning to work.
 The last point to add, my fiancée (also a foreign national) and I are getting married, so I could return once that paperwork is finished but her countries government makes that of Vietnam look like a well oiled machine, so I don&#x27;t want to rely on that. 
 TLDR: I have a year off and would prefer to stay in Vietnam to study than go home to my home country. What are the best options?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has experience getting a licence to legally drive / ride a scooter in Vietnam?I&#x27;m headed over to Da Nang later this year, planning to stay for some months by doing border runs with tourist e-visas. Thinking that it&#x27;ll be fun to ride over there and explore around the city and surrounding areas. Also get the impression VN has pretty intense traffic accident rates, so I&#x27;m keen to get insurance that covers this in case I get caught out - need to be driving legally to be covered though. I&#x27;m a New Zealander who is licensed to drive legally in my own country, but I guess I need to upgrade this somehow to ride over there. Do any foreigners have experience getting licensing to ride legally in Vietnam?
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m currently in HCMC (from the US) and my Mac refuses to charge. When plugged in, it stays at its current percentage but won&#x27;t go any higher. It also feels very staticky so I&#x27;m keeping it unplugged for the time being. Is there anything a can buy so I can charge my laptop? I&#x27;ll be in Vietnam for the rest of the month. Also if anyone knows a specific place to buy what I need would be appreciated too. I&#x27;m in D1 if it helps. I&#x27;ve attached a picture of the outlet at my Airbnb. 
 Thanks!
 Update: I left my MacBook on plugged in while I was away and it continued to charge even though it says not charging. I believe the issue is the charger so I&#x27;ll try to buy a new one tomorrow. Thanks everyone!!

Please plus your favourite places or mates&#x27; places. Someone told me that Hanoi Computer&#x27;s laptops are overpriced, so I decided to look elsewhere. Thanks beforehand 😄

 Would love to hear the good and bad; from the pictures they seem very similar including location. Biggest priority for me would be quality of gym and groceries close by,
 TIA!

 Here is the email:
 Hello, 
 My name is ____, and I am a student at New York University. I am applying for an academic fellowship that emphasizes work in human rights and volunteerism. I have chosen your organization, VAVA because I am passionate about environmental activism and combatting the detrimental effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam. 
 I only require your written consent in an email to reference your organization in my application. 
 Thank you for taking the time to read my email. 
 Enjoy your day,
 (name)

                              <span>I see a lot of images and video of flooding in central VN. Not knowing anything about that region I’m concerned about the people that live there. Is this an expected event that infrastructure, people, houses, and business bounce back from pretty quickly? Or is this something that will take a long time to recover from? How are people doing??

                              <span>I arrived in HCM a week ago, and will be here for a year. I’ve been getting stuck into the awesome food here, from all sorts of places.
 I ended up getting pretty ill last night, so much so i spent the night on drip due to dehydration. Turns out a triple whammy of e-colo, salmonella and cholera were the culprits!
 I cant quite pin down what might have cause it, as I say, ive been indulging. But any food/drink stuff you’d advise to stay away from to avoid this in the future? Im not drinking tap water, but aside from that havnt avoided anything yet. Cheers!

                              <span>I see so much about tourism numbers in the Vietnamese news and then one line at the bottom will say that the country now allows people from 80 countries get an e-visa. But it&#x27;s never made clear that this a massive downgrade from before when far more countries could get their visa letter online.
 How do you feel about this? Do you care that you&#x27;re shutting out over half the world&#x27;s countries, for what is ostensibly, no reason?

                              <span>How come celebrities don&#x27;t come to Vietnam to perform? I&#x27;m talking about Western artists/Kpop idols. I know a few years back Blackpink performed in Hanoi, but they&#x27;re not coming back for their new world tour. I&#x27;m just using them as an example because I have not seen any big name artist come to Vietnam recently ... why is that? 
 I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a covid thing, but other Southeast Asian countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines) have a lot of big artists performing there so maybe it&#x27;s not that. 
 Is it a popularity thing? Just curious because I love attending concerts and it&#x27;s just sad I won&#x27;t be able to hear live music from my favorite artists when I spend my time in Vietnam.

                              <span>I got scratched by a dog in Hanoi, Vietnam. Seemed to be a puppy (or a miniature breed), since it was playful. It ran up to me and tried jumping on my legs, then ran away. Not aggressive. It was sitting by a store and looked healthy &amp; clean, but had no collar on it.
 The scratch didn’t visually bleed and I don’t see broken skin, but it left a white line (like when you scratch your own arm with your nail). The dog also licked my leg (no visible open wounds, but I had shaved that morning so you never know).
 Do I need to get post exposure rabies shots, or am I being paranoid? Sorry in advance if this is incredibly stupid. I lived a part of my childhood in India, where rabies is a big deal.

                              <span>I 27m American am going to fly to Hanoi in November. I have never taken an international flight before I know I have to get a visa has it been easy to get one on site recently? 
 What should I know about finding a good place to stay and rest my head. How do I know what are the bad areas of town?
 I have a friend 35f VNese who wants me to visit w her. Is there anything I should know that could be a legal issue? Vì du: in Muslim countries a man and a woman if not married or family can’t have a hotel room together. 
 What is the to do in Há nội and what is there to do in Vinh. I like to eat VNese food because I have a few Viet kiểu friends who introduced me to like bun rieu and bun Bo hue. I’m creative sometimes and I love nature.
 Any and all feedback is appreciated.

                              <span>Srs help needed for Central Vietnam Trip.
 In Short, I am arriving in Vietnam (Central &amp; North) for 18-21days. I am coming in to DN first.
 However, I just noticed that it is the rainy season &amp; i didn&#x27;t expect Hoi An/DN/Hue to be flooded that badly. As you can see my past post history, others have mentioned that the flood generally come and go quickly and 99% of the cities/ tourist spot are still accessible.
 After seeing the news on DN/Hue ytd and today, I am even more worried and really need some advice here from the viet community. (I have done my research online and reddits alrdy to prevent overposting, but i really need some assurance and guidance. Hope my post doesnt get removed).
 ​
 Q1) How true is it that the flood doesnt impact 99% of the cities and tourist spot are generally accessible?
 Q2) If it rains heavily, How long does the flood takes to recede so that I can travel off?
 Usually, Are the railway trains station still accessible during floods?
 Q3) Even tho, it is hard to predict the likelyhood of floods, &amp; I can still visit the 7-14days weather forecast. But if the city (DN/Hoi An/ Hue) has already flooded before, and the typhoon/storm heads somewhere else, are they still prone to flooding?
 Q4) Aside from weather forecast, what can i search on to warn myself of upcoming flood?
 Q4) Are the northern Vietnam safe from flooding? So i can change my plans?
 ​
 This is my first 20+ days trip to vietnam, and i really didn&#x27;t foresee this coming. Appreciate many help

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am visiting Vietnam next month and was wondering if I should book Vietjet flights. They are quite inexpensive as compared to others. How has your experience with them been? The official Vietjet website looks somewhat funny to me and I want to be sure that it&#x27;s a reliable airline. If there is some problem with the flight on their end (delay/loss of baggage/cancellation of flight/whatever else), will travel insurance take care of it?
 Would appreciate advice/suggestions/narration of your own experiences with the airline.
 Thanks a ton!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am planning a short trip to Tokyo (from Noi Bai) and I was wondering which airline was recommended. 
 I have heard/read very negative stories about Vietjet so I was thinking of going with a different carrier like Hahn, but I think that they are operated by Vietjet anyway? 
 I&#x27;m seeing options with Vietnam airlines also but they have layovers in SGN, I would prefer a direct flight. 
 Any opinions? Is Vietjet really that bad?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 My GF and me are currently in Da Nang. At least where we are staying Da Nang ist flooded.
 Tomorrow morning we have a flight to Hanoi at 8:30.
 In the evening we hope to catch our flight back to Germany at around 18:30.
 Are here any people from Da Nang that can tell me how high our chances for our flight to Hanoi to take off?
 Thanks in advance, you guys really helped us with our travel. We really enjoyed our first trip to vietnam.

                              <span>Đồ biểu sau thể hiện các giai đoạn ba loại chữ viết chính của tiếng Việt được sử dụng. Theo các dữ kiện lịch sử thì:
 • Chữ Hán được cho là bắt đầu được sử dụng ở Việt Nam khi Thái Thú Sĩ Nhiếp dạy thi thư cho người Việt vào khoảng năm 200.
 • Chữ Nôm có văn tự sớm nhất từ thời nhà Lý, xuất hiện đầu tiên trên các chuông chùa từ năm 1076.
 Cả chữ Hán và chữ Nôm đều không còn được sử dụng rộng rãi từ sau kỳ thi Hội cuối cùng ở Việt Nam năm 1919.
 • Chữ Latin được chính thức sử dụng trong các công văn ở Việt Nam theo nghị định do Phó Đề đốc Marie Gustave Hector Ohier ký từ năm 1869.
 Có thể thấy, chữ Latin là loại chữ viết còn khá trẻ của tiếng Việt.
 Các bạn nghĩ sao về các loại chữ viết của tiếng Việt?

                              <span>I just recently accepted an offer to work in Hanoi, and will move there next year from California with my wife and kid. We don&#x27;t have much stuff, but we feel so strongly about the toys of my kid which in total can go up to 200 lbs (~100 kg). I wonder if anyone who has sent such a large amount of stuff to Vietnam could give me some tips ? I did research on the Internet but there are so many companies and there aren&#x27;t a lot of reviews. Thanks.

                              <span>I have been using a MacBook Air for 8 years (before that Windows), and now it would die soon, so I am thinking of what’s next.
 I mostly use for office purposes: email, word, excel, research on web and posting on a Wordpress website, a bit of resizing pictures or joining videos, but not much.
 I like touch screen Windows but it sounds like Mac is more durable and more smooth? I have an iPhone so it’s convenient to use with Mac but it’s just a 6s I got for free. What I don’t like about recent Mac is the USB port.
 So what do you guys use? MacBook/Windows/Linux and how’s your experience? Anyone use surface? Anyone use iPad with keyboard instead of a laptop?

                              <span>Hey all,
 I recently came back from a 4 month trip in Vietnam where I cruised along with hotels and airbnbs. Yes it got slightly out of hand and my budget grew.
 I work remotely and I’ve decided to try living in Vietnam longer term. I have a 5 year visa and I need to exit the country every 6 months which is fine because visit family and friends back home. 
  
 I am figuring out the right visa for me… Even though I can stay in the country for 6 months on a tourist visa. But I’m confused? 
  
I want to rent a high rise serviced apartment with 2 rooms close to the center. Is US$600 per month enough? 
 I don’t plan to party and drink (as much as I did last trip) and I’m more focused on really understanding the motherland. I want it to be more meaningful and I create real, lasting friendships. 
 So I plan to budget US$500-800 for spending money for everything I need per month.
 I’m extremely interested in investing and entrepreneurship here in Vietnam. So I’d like to start a business here. 
 I leave in December again. I’m getting travel insurance etc. visa, passport and everything renewed. 
 Any tips are welcome! Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, spending two weeks in South Vietnam in December and from my research I&#x27;ve only found recommendations mostly for North Vietnam. Not much on the South. Flying into ho chi, does anyone have some heavily recommended places to go?
 Looking to do two places, a week in each unless it&#x27;s worth doing more splits.
 Mainly after beaches, attractions and good food, bars and restaurants also appreciated

                              <span>Hey guys! I hope you are doing well.
 So early next year I am going to visit Vietnam, but I only have 7 days do explore the country. I know, 7 days is nothing in a country such as this.
 I am going to start in Ho Chi Minh, for the first 2 days, then I was thinking of taking an overnight train/bus to start making my way up to Hanoi. 
 Other than Ho Chi Minh, I would like to visit Halong Bay, or Ninh Binh, or maybe both. Then I would like to go up to the Mount Fansipan (highest point), then obviously visit Hanoi too.
 Is this doable? Do you guys have any recommendations for me?
 Thank you so much!
 All the best.

                              <span>I am with a charity that helps newly arriving refugees. One of the things we do is provide 2 weeks of groceries to help tide them over till benefits and jobs kick in. Sometimes our volunteers provide the groceries. Sometimes people give us money and we do a grocery pickup for the case worker. 
 Will you help me create a list of basics that they may want in their kitchen? Keep in mind that the food is limited in Walmart - for example, I can&#x27;t get rice noodles most of the time, so food that can be substituted is important. They will have nothing in their kitchens and we can&#x27;t provide everything so knowing what foods are more common/used more is better than having a big variety of things. Meats, grains, produce spices, condiments, etc.

                              <span>My parents decided to support my backpacking trip here in their own way, they gave me 100 dollars with one condition: &quot;spend it on something unique that you would never ever spend your own money on&quot;
 Souvenirs, hotels, food, vehicle, experiences, anything goes! A good story for the grandkids later.
 This is a lot of money for me, so by no means do i mean to waste 100 dollars on shots or something. What would you do given the same condition?

 I initially didn&#x27;t really plan to go vietnam but im thinking maybe visiting for a couple of days.
 Any idea?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been listening to &quot;Người Ơi Người Ở Đừng Về&quot; by Duc Phuc and it is becoming an earworm.
 I&#x27;ve read the translated lyrics, and it&#x27;s such a fun and happy tune/music. 
 Are there any other similar Vnmese music?
 Thanks, cam on rat nhieu~

                              <span>I see many myths perpetuated both here and in daily life. This happens with all languages (see endless arguments on YouTube about Tamil/Sanskrit/Chinese being &#x27;the oldest language&#x27;, a nonsensical notion).
 Some typical myths:
 - Vietnamese grammar is &#x27;backwards&#x27; compared to English/other language of choice (or just difficult in general)
 - Vietnamese has many words/syllables/etc. with different meanings (making it difficult)
 - The Vietnamese writing system is difficult and &#x27;needs&#x27; to be reformed
 Just off the top of my head, I have seen and heard these three very recently. If I sat down and thought/researched I could list many more.
 The problem is that none of these claims mean anything in isolation. Many words with different meanings---compared to what language? Difficult writing system---compared to what other writing systems? And where&#x27;s the evidence? There is never or very rarely any evidence or standards of comparison given. As a linguist I could go into detail on these issues, but I&#x27;d rather see what other people have to say first.
 Now flame me and tell me why I&#x27;m wrong.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m back in Vietnam for a few months as a break and to attend my cousins wedding in late November. I was born in Vietnam but left at a very young age and a dual citizen of both countries. I&#x27;ve made the stupid mistake of applying for an ID which means now that my name is in the system and they&#x27;ve just called me up for a health checkup tomorrow for conscription in 2023 as I&#x27;m 23yo and the age of conscription is until you&#x27;re 27 (as I&#x27;ve recently found out).
 Has anyone been through this before? Is there any way to get out of this since I&#x27;m a dual citizen or would I have to leave the country ASAP, I did enter on my Vietnamese Passport. My mum is convinced if they conscript me I&#x27;ll lose my Australian citizenship.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate some advice or if anyone could recommend me a good lawyer in Hanoi regarding this matter, thank you.

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;m going HCMC on November. I&#x27;m planning to go hoi Ann for sure. But where else can I go? I want to really experience the culture there and escape the city life. I don&#x27;t even mind going for trekking and stuff. Any recommendations?

                              <span>Hello all! 
 Anyone knows what are the requirements for an American citizen and a Vietnamese citizen to get married and apply for the Vietnam 5-year visa exemption certificate? 
 Especially, any income or jobs requirements if we want to live in Vietnam for around 5 years? I assume the Vietnamese spouse has to earn a certain amount of income to sponsor the American spouse. 
 Any advices and personal experiences are greatly appreciate! Just wanna get a general idea of what we will need to deal with :)

                              <span>Would love to know what are thoughts from different age groups of Vietnam locals about developing advanced economy, despite all the problems mentioned in different industry articles.
 My core part at work is a radical shift in commerce / production &amp; supply chains with innovating incentives for companies, employees and end customers / consumers that adopts to clean tech driven supply chains; be it food, healthcare, renewables, electronics, FMCG, sales through new B2B, B2C channels, services, EVs etc.
 I personally love the creative designs from Vietnam that uses natural biofibers (bamboo, hyacinth etc.) &amp; overall designs. They are at par with details from Japanese, Chinese, Thailand&#x27;s creative arts - a mix of tradition, nature &amp; modern.
 I also got surprised by recent developments &amp; announcements by Vingroup EV making in US for US customers. &amp; at the same time, I wonder why MSMEs (Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises) of Vietnam are not gearing up faster at global stage. 
 For example, I never see them at industrial trade shows of the West (US, EU) or even at the East (digital or physical attendance), even though products are pretty good &amp; innovative. Lets say Amazon SEA summit in Singapore, there are zero Vietnamese companies / MSMEs.
 Few of them are on Alibaba, but finding other MSMEs is hard as Alibaba is not that connected with new development outside of China, and the restrictions etc. makes it more complicated. 
 Also, few good points from my research are repeated in this article: on Vietnam + ASEAN region since most of our suppliers at work are looking at ASEAN countries for shifting their production from China.

                              <span>I just wanna order a cute tiny plush for my friend. It&#x27;s shipping from Sweden, and the plush is about 9cm. (She lives in Ho Chi Minh btw). She&#x27;s telling me that the delivery guy can&#x27;t just drop it off at her house if they can&#x27;t get in contact with her. She said they usually call the recipient to pick it up and if they don&#x27;t respond, they cant deliver the package?? The site didn&#x27;t let me put a phone number in so idk how tf thats gonna work lol 
 If they can&#x27;t contact the recipient do they just take it back to the post office and she would have to pick it up herself?

                              <span>I really want to visit Vietnam next year between 25 august - 15 september but I’m scared that there might be a lot of rain and clouds ruining my trip. I plan on going from the south to north. What weather can I expect? I’m looking into its nightlife. Does it rain at night? And in the north, how cloudy is it? Is it possible to the the view from the mountains without clouds? Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi Reddit, I’m taking a domestic flight from HCM to Phu Quoc via Vietnam Airline. I do not plan to have a checked bag for this particular domestic flight and just travel with a carry-on. But, I have quite a bit of toiletries items that exceed the US TSA liquid rule. Do the Vietnam domestic flight have a rule on liquid in carry-on? Many thanks!

                              <span>Okay, so I’m learning about Vietnam for my French class right now and we’re discussing the “Boat People” or the refugees who fled the country after the end of the war in ‘75. So this to me seems a bit sketchy (I identify as between socialist and ML). Who were the people that fled, just former bureaucrats for the south and sympathizers, or just your average Joe. What were the education centres? Disguised prisons or actual places where people learned about socialism? Overall, is it justified in calling Vietnam authoritarian post war and were the people justly fleeing the nation, or was it just propaganda and actual crimes of those who fled that caused the exodus

I know revolt has tracking on it, but I’d still like a reliable place. Is it as simple as finding a post office on Google maps and using that as an address?

                              <span>Hey all!
 I am planning a vacation to Vietnam in the month of November, specifically, in the third and fourth weeks of November. I read that Central Vietnam gets flooded during this period. Is that true? What are the chances of that happening? Which areas should I steer clear of if I want to stay safe? Appreciate any information you could give about this.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, not trying to be rude with this question, just genuinely curious. I have a lot of friends in Vietnam, and whenever I look at their pictures, or pics of their friends, or even just random Vietnamese people, they all wear Gucci and Chloe and Supreme branded shirts and shoes (I know it&#x27;s all fake, because like, my guy, the floor of your home is dirt) but it&#x27;s curious to me. Why go for the luxury brand stuff so much? I dont even know that many Americans into this stuff but like every Vietnamese person I see is in Balenciaga tshirts with Louis Vuitton Air Jordans on. Especially since we all know it&#x27;s counterfeit. What&#x27;s the point?

                              <span>hi there im a 21 year old from the bay area, ca. i&#x27;m pretty cut off from my heritage, and i&#x27;m trying to research more about any kind of scene or punk bands in vietnam as a means to feel closer.
 from what i understand, any kind of scene is pretty minimal at the moment but there was some activity back in the 1990&#x27;s/2010&#x27;s. i&#x27;ve heard saigon and hanoi come up a lot as culture hot spots, but what is it like now? are there any memorable bands worth mentioning? is there an alternative scene in vietnam at all and what does it look like?
 i&#x27;ve discovered gỗlim (https://open.spotify.com/track/35WT2fGUfzi7GwKVUSR2pG?si&#x3D;gPaZnkvGQHepWxtrf_HyUw&amp;utm_source&#x3D;copy-link), and i&#x27;ve also stumbled across 7uppercut, đá sối tội, and mona evie.
 thank you :-) ❤️

                              <span>Hello, I’m interested in doing a 3 day/2 night Ha Giang tour by motorbike. Anyone have suggestions for a good company at a reasonable price? I would like to book with an easy rider for myself and my partner will be riding on his own.

 I would like to kindly ask to the people&#x27;s who have a role in game development (Unity) industry in Vietnam to give a hand for an foreign dev buddy to find a suitable team in Vietnam.
 In return of any help attempt am ready to share my knowledge about game development.

 Thank you from now and peace

                              <span>So I stupidly bought my passport out with me last night to the cinema, and I must of dropped my wallet outside the shopping mall. I now need to apply for a new passport, and I’ve read that you need to file a police report. 
 I went to the police station nearest to the cinema, I had to Google translate and I got told to go to another police station. When I got to the other police station, the guy flat out refused to file a report for me which annoyed me.
 I’m at my wits ends I don’t know what to do. Can I apply for a new passport at the embassy without A police report?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are a couple from India who would be travelling to Hanoi in December, we are excited to be there!!
 We have a few questions -
  
We are trying to get tickets from Hanoi to India back, but VietJet Air seems to be rejecting our tickets, also the flights are not showing up on its website! Is there a problem with it? 
 
What should we do about the accommodations while in Vietnam, we have budget for 4 star hotels but some fellow travellers told us getting AirBnbs would be a lot better. What do you suggest?
 
We have a 6 day trip, what all places do you suggest we visit?
 
 Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>Hi! We&#x27;ve applied for an evisa but didn&#x27;t realise the offices opening hours didn&#x27;t include the weekend, and we are due to fly tomorrow afternoon. We&#x27;ve emailed to try and speed up the process but trying to come up with other solutions. 
 We all hold british passports so would be able to enter for 14 days with just proof of a flight out of Vietnam and then extend this whilst there? 
 Any help/advice would be appreciated! :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been researching health insurance plans and the company tenzing pacific was one of the recommended places. 
 On their website:
 https://ten-pac.com/direct-billing-is-great-but-not-perfect-for-everything/?utm_source&#x3D;social+media&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;post&amp;utm_campaign&#x3D;blog-directbilling
 they have a graphic and it says direct billing &#x27;eliminates paperwork&#x27;...but then below that it says direct billing is useful but can have drawbacks. It goes on to say:
  
One reality most people aren’t aware of is that many medical providers charge more if you have insurance. They do this because they don’t have the additional costs of administering insurance billing and payments...
  
Surely, if the medical provider do NOT have the additional cost of administering billing and payments then the bill will be LESS not MORE?

                              <span>Hi
 I am visiting Northern Vietnam this week. I am looking for tips, recommendations and any warnings that I can make use. 
 I am landing in Hanoi. And planned to take the cruise for Ha Lon Bay. But I don’t have any plans for almost a week. 
 I plan to do local sightseeing and also shopping. I want to buy local stuff and hopefully within budget. 
 I plan to travel a couple of places near Ha Noi where I can go for day tours but not sure yet
 I have already been to Saigon few months ago. 
 Looking for help from you guys. 
 TIA

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a week early December to spend in either Thailand or Vietnam.
 Has anyone been to both and can share experiences and what their favourite was and why?
 About me: I am 29(F). I don’t enjoy kicking back and relaxing on holidays (I know these places are good for that but not why I’d go) - I want to see interesting things, go on hikes, see beautiful landscapes and learn about culture and history.
 Appreciate your help! :)

                              <span>My mom and I are in Vietnam. We are from the United States. I will be exploring different cities in Vietnam while my mom will be staying with family in Phước Tỉnh. What would be the best way to send money to her while I am travelling abroad in Vietnam if she happens to need more money? She is much older and not good with technology so PayPal and those kinds of apps are not ideal.

                              <span>I am sure that this type of question is posted and reposted multiple times around this time of year, so I apologize if I am being redundant. I searched Tet in the sub history and did not see many things regarding the questions I have.
 Firstly, my girlfriend and I are interested in traveling to Vietnam during Tet as it seems like a joyous way to celebrate the new year. Here in the US there are group activities such as bars to go to and fire work shows. We looked at cities and dates, and have thought about spending the month of January from beginning to end in Hoi An.
 I understand we may be behaving as ignorant Americans, thinking that everything will be open or that there will be mass celebrations. But we really just want to experience the culture. Is it possible -post Covid- to do this somewhere in Vietnam? Neither of us wish to be disrespectful to your country. We are realistic travelers, we know to go with the flow and are ok with buying food to make our own meals. We do NOT expect to be catered to or waited on. We want to enjoy your beautiful culture.
 Is Hoi An truly a good city for this type of thing, or should we go to Ho Chi Minh city?
 If it is possible to join a city in celebration of Tet, how should we go about this while being respectful?
 Thank you for taking the time to read this, I wish you the best.
 ​
 EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. I see I did misunderstand the nature of Tet. It seems it would be better for my girlfriend and I to visit during a different time year. I appreciate you all. We will look for somewhere else to visit.

                              <span>So, my gf is currently in vietnam and I&#x27;m in Cambodia. I was recently in vietnam on 15 day visa exemption, but now I want to work out the cheapest way to stay in VN for approx 3-4 months as a tourist.
 it&#x27;ll be Da Nang by the way.
 I assume flying in with e-visa is the first step, but what then? someone mentioned the cheapest way currently is to fly to BKK and back on e-visa again every 30 days - is this right??

                              <span>Hi r/Vietnam
 I&#x27;m going to central Vietnam (Da Nang, Hoi an, Hue) in a couple days. 
 It&#x27;s gonna be a short trip. We&#x27;ll arrive on Monday evening and leave Saturday morning (so about 5.5 days in Vietnam?)
 So my question is, how much should I budget for this? I don&#x27;t have fancy tastes or require luxurious hotels.
 And also, what&#x27;s the best way to get my Dong?
 Its probably gonna be the most convenient to exchange my money at the airport but I&#x27;ve heard the rates aren&#x27;t so good...

                              <span>Hi everyone, we would like to move to Đà Nẵng-Vietnam from Germany and stay in Vietnam for a long period of time. 
 About our backgrounds: Me, vietnamese, i&#x27;ve been working in Germany as a nurse since 2018 My fiancé, german, currently working for an enery provider.
 It&#x27;d be helpful, if anyone could give us some insights. About what we should prepare, before we make the move. Maybe someone who has recently moved there. What should we pay attention to? How is life going on for you guys in Đà Nẵng or anywhere else in Việt Nam?
 About visa: should we first register our marriage in Germany, so my fiancé can get the 5 years visa?
 We want to prepare and inform ourself before the we make the big decision. We would be thankful for any tips or resources from you guys.
 Why i am a vietnamese and i still need to ask? Because i can&#x27;t possibly know everything, what my fiancé should prepare, etc ...if we should first get married in Germany, if it gives him any advantage about visa.

                              <span>I chat with an Indian. After a month we arranged to meet at a coffee shop.
 The first time we met, we talked normally, suddenly he asked me &quot;How much is my salary?&quot;. This is a question that makes me quite uncomfortable, there are many topics to ask but he chose to talk about salary first. Not to mention he has body odor, bad feet and smelly shoes which is quite annoying to me. He disrespected me in our first dating. I don&#x27;t need someone who is too handsome, I just need to dress neatly and cleanly
 After that meeting, he suggested we become lovers :))), of course I refused and just wanted to stay friends but he kept bothering me, so I blocked him and no more contact. 
 As a Vietnamese myself, I get annoyed when other people ask about my salary. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s normal to ask about salary in the first meeting for foreigners?

                              <span>I&#x27;m flying to Hanoi at the end of the month and will be travelling north to south over the course of 30 days. I&#x27;ve been researching itineraries online and on this subreddit but there&#x27;s a lot of information out there. It makes me feel a little overwhelmed and unprepared.
 I have some places in mind that I&#x27;d like to visit and have drawn up a rough timeline. I&#x27;m pretty flexible so your input and any useful information/advice would be much appreciated. I&#x27;ve opted for 3 nights in Hanoi as I arrive late evening. My timeline is as follows:
 Hanoi: 3 nights Sapa: 2 nights Ha Giang loop: 3 nights Halong bay: 2 nights Ninh Binh: 2 nights Vinh: 2 nights Hue: 2 nights Hoi An: 3 nights Nha Trang: 2 nights Dalat: 2 nights Mui Ne: 2 nights Ho Chi Minh: 3 nights Phu Quoc: 2 nights (Optional)
 Thank you, cam on!

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m not of Vietnamese descent, but a character in a story I&#x27;m working on is and I want to get this right!
 She is first-generation Vietnamese American, so she will go by an English (Christian) name throughout the story, but she still needs a Vietnamese given name and family name. 
 The English name I&#x27;d want to give to her is Trinity -- so &quot;Trinh&quot; would be perfect, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;d sound weird if used as a first name. Any other ideas? I&#x27;m not super committed to &quot;Trinity,&quot; but I&#x27;d like there to be some connection between her given name and English name.
 I also need a family name. I know &quot;Nguyen&quot; is the stereotypical one, but if you were reading a book with a Vietnamese main character, what other names would sound normal and natural to you?

                              <span>People will often use Google Translate to communicate with me because I don&#x27;t understand Vietnamese at all. 
 When they show me the translation (Vietnamese to English), I can understand what they mean, but when it&#x27;s my turn to type something, they often look confused when they see the translation provided by Google Translate. 
 It makes me wonder, is the app accurate when it comes to translating English into Vietnamese? It seems to be ok the other way around.

Especially with what&#x27;s happening in Iran and other places around the world. 
 What would it actually take to create an uprising against the tyranny of the government and elites? And if that happened, what would likely occur? Would they be able to quash the rebellion if it was big enough?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I’m currently in Ho Chi Minh city, from where I’m planning to travel up to Hoi An eventually. I want to take a train up towards Mui Ne first. I booked one that arrives at the Binh Thuan station, which is a bit further away from Mui Ne. Does anyone know whether it is easy to get good reliable transportation between Mui Ne and that train station?

                              <span>I will be in Ho Chi Minh for a few days at the end of October and would like to make a trip to the Mekong Delta. I have looked at offers for day trips on various sites and they all say the same and very touristy. It seems like you are driven from shop to shop to buy coconut sweets, honey and chocolate and then see a show of people playing &quot;traditional&quot; music for you. Maybe I&#x27;m being too sceptical and it&#x27;s not a touristy mall after all, but maybe someone here has experience with this.
 Are there perhaps other providers who offer tours on less beaten paths? I am grateful for any tips.

                              <span>Hello y&#x27;all, I&#x27;m a female solo traveler planning to go to Vietnam (and also Cambodia) for a backpacking trip. I&#x27;m planning to visit the country south to north (mostly focusing on the north) , and I&#x27;d like to stay in Vietnam for 25 days (I&#x27;ll dedicate either 4-5 days to Cambodia, just checking out to the capital and Angkor Wat). Is that enough or too much time? My main interest are nature, and history. I don&#x27;t really care about hitting the beach, and partying is okay but not like a must. My itinerary is Ho chi Minh - flight to Hoi an - Hue - Phong Nha - Tom Coc (ninh binh) - Hanoi - cruise to Ha long Bay - Ha Giang Loop . Is there anything that i&#x27;m missing?
 I&#x27;m planning to be there at the end of February, March (i&#x27;ll definitely be in the north during march). Is that a good time to visit? Can I book everything once I&#x27;m already there such as accommodation/flights to have some extra flexibility, or is it high season and I&#x27;d probably book everything ahead to avoid shitty hostels and expensive flights?
 Should I bother going to Sapa or is it too cold/foggy in March, and not worth it?
 How is it safety wise? Are night buses safe, do they drop you in the middle of nowhere or you can ask them to drop you close to your accommodation? I&#x27;m not thrilled about potentially walking alone at night with a huge backpack. Can you as tourist (i&#x27;m a skinny white girl there is no way I&#x27;ll pass for a Vietnamese) walk safely at night alone ? Is taking taxis/tuk tuk alone at night safe (i&#x27;ve lived in south america, heard way too many horror stories)?
 Thanks for all the help :)

                              <span>Hi!
 First time solo traveler here planning a trip from Dec 22nd for 3 weeks. Already booked a flight to Hanoi and plan to travel N to S. 
 I&#x27;ve heard sapa is still worth it, but halong bay might not be due to the weather. Have also heard to limit Hoi An to 1-2 days. Any other recommendations would be appreciated greatly!

                              <span>I traveled to Northern Vietnam a few years ago and stayed with locals in different places in the northern region. I still dream about the breakfast spread. The eggs were cooked I believe with fish sauce but I can’t quite figure it out. The eggs were scrambled I think and ended up clumpy so you could grab a piece, add to your rice and enjoy. They served rice bowl, eggs in bowl, some kind of sprouts (any ideas here too?), and other bowls of food like tofu.
 Please help!

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I plan on living in Vietnam after graduating university. I was born in Germany and would finish university at approximately age 24. I am a vietnamese citizen despite being born in Germany. 
 So now I&#x27;d like to ask on how conscription would affect me, since I am also a pacifist.
 Thank you!

The ticket I bought requires me to get bags in Vietnam from my Dubai flight and recheck them in (I believe this means I have to pass through customs) before I go on to my next journey to Australia. Does this mean I need to get an E-visa even though I wont even be exiting the airport?

                              <span>I have 3 days and 2 nights from 30th Oct to 2nd Nov after returning from Halong bay cruise and it seems like I can only do one experience in the North to end my long trip. Which one would be the best?
  
Sapa (Trekking, Visiting Fanispan)
 Ha Giang (Motorbike tour)
 Ba be lake + Ban Gioc Waterfalls
  
Which one would be the best considering the time I have and for travelling solo? Can i fit in more than one place?
 I have to return to Hanoi to catch my flight on the 2nd.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I have been reading a lot about ethnic, mountainous groups in rural settings of Vietnam. I came across the Chut ethnic group located in eastern Laos and in Quang Binh province and I’ve have been trying to find information on their religious beliefs and specific cultural idiosyncrasies that separate them from or align them with other ethnic practices in Vietnam. I suppose I am more trying to find out more about their “religious” practices, primarily relating to death and funeral processions. I can’t find anything. 
 Do they practice a generally “animist” belief system pertaining to the afterlife, spirits, etc? I know commonly in animist belief structure, there is this idea of the wandering soul, in that unnatural or untimely or violent death can result in malevolent spirits that cause turmoil for those around. Is this pertinent among any of the 5 subgroups (ruc, May, etc) under the Chut umbrella? 
 Thanks for any input

 I find all of the info somewhat confusing. Seems like an e-Sim would be the way to go, since my iPhone is not unlocked. Can anyone please share their useful info/ experiences? Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hi everyone. American here; I live with my Vietnamese-American wife and my Vietnamese mother-in-law. I need some help. Sorry for the incomplete information, but my MIL&#x27;s English isn&#x27;t great and my Vietnamese is worse.
 Today, my MIL was telling me that she&#x27;s very concerned because she follows a guy (singer? monk?) on YouTube, who is famous for raising five orphans. This is the Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/thienambenbovutru9. Apparently the guy is in jail because he&#x27;s been accused of having sex with the kids, but he&#x27;s claiming innocence and asking people to sign a petition for him.
 Does anyone know about this? Is this some kind of famous case? And if so, how can my MIL sign the petition for him?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I&#x27;m just planning a trip for next year.
 And as part of the trip I want to mention an apartment in the area of ​​District 1.
 My only problem is calculating a budget for the trip.
 How much money do you think you need per month? For a good apartment.. and to eat every day in a restaurant?
 Because I understood that your country is very cheap.
 1500 dollars per month should be enough?
 sorry for the english
 I use automatic translation so it&#x27;s not that good

                              <span>Hi guys, I stayed in Vietnam for a couple months pre-covid (Hanoi, Da Nang, Cat Ba) and really miss it. I am planning to spend a couple years now and would like to keep my skills sharp. 
 I&#x27;m wondering what the process/opportunities are like for foreign English speaking software engineers? I don&#x27;t need anything fancy (although would be nice) just something that will keep me busy and meet new people. 
 Any advice or experience appreciated!

                              <span>Hello
 Flying to hanoi to attend a wedding at the end of the month. I will be with a group of other foreigners (10 of us from around the world)
 Have no idea what to expect, what the dress code will be or what we need to bring.
 So far we have been told the time and location of said wedding. Apparently there is a ceremony, I have been led to believe two monks will be there (what do the monks do?) that the bride and groom will then leave to take photos in a different location, then come back for the reception. 
 I’ve been told by a different friend who currently lives in Saigon that Vietnamese weddings aren’t too long, and there’s often karaoke involved. 
 Any information that will help my friends and I not be totally blindsided or make any cultural faux pas would be appreciated.

                              <span>We are visiting Vietnam in January for 1 week. We like to scuba dive. We also like to scenic landscapes with waterfalls or mountains and rivers. Is Hanoi better or Ho Chi Minh?
 Edit: Thanks for the excellent information guys! I think we are set on Hanoi, area because Scuba is less of a priority for us. Definitely more interested in dramatic landscapes. Really appreciate all the tips.
 Are the common scam tactics we should watch out for?
 Edit 2: After seeing comments about high chances of fog in Hanoi area we are unsure now. We are thinking central coast, as a happy medium in between both. I assume we have to fly there from either Hanoi or Saigon?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure what city is most &quot;well known&quot; for really good bang for buck dress shirts made, I heard of Hoi An or something which was best but its not part of the itinerary unfortunately. Was wondering out of the listed cities, which one should I get custom shirts done at?

                              <span>Hello all, not sure if this is the proper thread to post these questions, but I figured I’d give it a try. I wanted to get some perspectives on the the animist religious structure in Vietnam, “The People’s Religion” - the belief structure and its history simply interest me and I’d like to learn more; that being said, there isn’t much info online so any input would be appreciated. Here’s a general outline of what I’d like to learn that:
 1) How did belief in good/bad spirits initially come to be from the beginning?
 2) How did the colonization Vietnam by the French, invasion by Japan and the split between North and south Vietnam during the communist era effect Animist beliefs?
 3) As with Buddhism and Catholicism for example, they produce cathedrals, sculptures, art and so on - tangible forms of their doctrines. Does Animism have any equivalent buildings, depictions, etc? 
 Just a guy here trying to learn. I’d appreciate any input.

                              <span>This seem to be a major problem in Vietnam. 
 I&#x27;ve never seen it on this scale anywhere else in the world apart from China.
 There are:
  
Overdevelopment by poorly run organisations who often do not finish their developments. They are left to rot as eyesores all over the country. Unfinished construction sides and rubbish everywhere. You can see this in Saigon, Hoi An, Dong Nai, Mui Ne, many places. And its too late to reverse it, the environment is already destroyed. They stay there to rot for a decade or more sometimes.
 Illegal developments, most likely with crooked local govt involvement. Example: https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/phu-quoc-to-raze-79-illegal-villas-4518959.html . And once again, the environment is totally destroyed already, cant get it back.
 Developments run by competent organisations, but way too much public land is granted to them. One example - Novaworld Phan Thiet was granted almost an entire 1km of public beach front land just for them. Likewise, big sections of Phu Quoc, Nha Trang, Quy Nhon and others have had the environment totally wiped out for all manner of empty resorts. Is this not outrageous?
  
I am interested to hear from Vietnamese especially. Are people upset and angry about stuff like this? Or do people not particularly care? Or do many people actually &#x27;like&#x27; it or prefer it?

                              <span>This is my frustrating and traumatizing experience as a traveller in HCMC.
 On 2 Oct 2022, I caught a peeping tom in the 3rd floor female toilet of Saigon Centre. I looked up in my cubicle (instinctively), saw that he dodged backwards. So I got dressed and started taking a video and slamming on his cubicle door.
 I cropped this video because I don&#x27;t know how to blur out his face. lol
 He exited the cubicle and acted like he entered the wrong toilet, but based on my video, his camera app was still on. I grabbed on to his wrist to prevent him from escaping and made him open his photo album AND SAW A COMPROMISING PHOTO HE TOOK OF ME IN THE TOILET. I made him delete the photo from his photo album AND recently deleted folder. I shouted at him so fiercely and angrily and berated him non-stop and…</span>

                              <span>Trước giờ mình rất tin tưởng và hài lòng với dịch vụ chăm sóc giày tại spa M, phí ở đây cũng không rẻ nhưng khi đôi giày giặt xong rất là hài lòng, mới như mua ở store về. Nhưng từ khi bên này chạy chương trình khuyến mãi thì xảy ra rất nhiều chuyện như: giày giặt cả tháng cũng chưa có, không hề gọi điện thoại báo, để khách đi đi lại lại nhiều lần, đôi khi nổi điên thì mới sắp xếp trả giày. Mà trả giày còn ẩm ướt mới tức.
 Một lần giặt đôi thể thao trắng (mới mang được 1 lần), giày giặt hơn cả tháng mới có, xong 2 ngày sau lấy ra thì giày mốc đen toàn bộ đôi giày. Mình mang lại thì nói xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại, hẹn mình 2 tuần sau quay lại trả giày. Khi nhận lại gì một số vết ố mốc đen giặt không ra, mình có hỏi thì nhận được câu trả lời “xin lỗi” là xong. Tức cầm giày về thế là bỏ luôn đôi giày.
 Hôm nay bị một cú quá đau, cách đây hơn 1 tháng mình có gửi giặt 3 đôi giày. Mình nhờ em mình ghé lấy giày dùm, em mình chỉ kiểm tra 1 đôi thì thấy đôi trắng bị mốc đen, cũng bài cũ xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại. Em mình cầm 2 đôi còn lại về mà ko kiểm. Tối mình đi làm về mở ra xem thì muốn chết đứng luôn ạ, toàn bộ da bị co cứng, teo lại và bị chết, đế lót cong veo,...mang ko còn vừa. Mình nhắn facebook không phản hồi. Là đôi mình rất thích kiếm mãi mới có, nên giữ rất cẩn thận, mỗi lần mang ai cũng khen đẹp. Lúc mang đến thì còn đẹp, nhận lại thì eo ôi không còn nhận ra hình hài của em nó...
 Thực sự quá tệ từ dịch vụ cho đến chất lượng :((

                              <span>I am just really curious that are there any decent size Youtubers that are living here in Vietnam? Not like travel youtubers that had been to the country or foreign youtubers making content exclusively Vietnamese if you know what I mean (like Phúc Mập is a good example). Youtubers like Quang Tran is a good example of what I mean, his content is not exclusively Vietnamese, like showcasing tourism, foods and culture. I see a lot of big foreign youtubers often prefer to live in Thailand, the Philippines and other East Asian countries but I don&#x27;t see a lot living in Vietnam.

Mình đang làm vị trí operation administrator tại 1 công ty Mỹ, công việc đang rất tốt và có cơ hội thăng tiến. Mình có tham gia tuyển TVHK (vi mình rất thích làm tvhk từ nhỏ) thì đã đậu, nhưng khi mình tìm hiểu hơn thì thấy hơi hoang mang ko biết có nên vào không. Vì phải đóng 1 số tiền khá lớn để training và với mức lương TVHK năm đầu tiền mình nghĩ bản thân sẽ gặp khó khăn rất nhiều, ngoài ra mình có nghe về vấn đề sắp chuyến bay nữa. Có ai đã hoặc đang làm TVHK ở đây có thể cho mình xin 1 chút ý kiến không ạ?? Mình cảm ơn nhiều.

 English Hi everyone, lets discuss about pho. Specifically how the name came about, is it named after the broth base or the noodle?
 Case in point: 1. If it’s named after the broth - let’s use egg noodles instead, is it still “pho”?
  
If it’s named after the noodle - let’s use hu tieu broth instead, is it still “pho”?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I was in 2018 and 2019 in VN (Hanoi, HCMC and a few other places) with my fiance and we are thinking about going back this December. We really liked the Old Quarter, the area around Hoan Kiem lake and the busy streets with the narrow houses.
 I was thinking about going to HCMC this time again and would like to know if there is a district or area where you can get this &quot;Hanoi feeling&quot;.
 Any help is highly appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I work in IT, 100% remote, so it&#x27;s technically possible for me to work from abroad instead of from home. I&#x27;ve considered going to Vietnam for 1mon to do so, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good fit culturally and logistically. Please share any experiences or insights.
 My main concerns are:
  
working time from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. - should I look for co-working spaces etc. or is it generally realistic to use the hotel WiFi? I don&#x27;t need a lot of bandwidth, but it should be stable.
 
I&#x27;m autistic and while sensory-wise bustling cities and dense traffic are totally fine, I struggle with judgemental/high conformity culture, expectations of haggling and worst, being viewed as a &quot;target&quot;. I have lived in China and Japan, which was okay since speaking the language mitigated most of the issues. Unfortunately, the reports about Vietnam I have read point towards exactly my issues being...well, an issue. What&#x27;s the real deal here?
 
 I have studied some Vietnamese and should be able to reach a low intermediate level by the time I go there, if that helps.

                              <span>I got married to a Viet girl recently and we argue about money a lot. I was born in Canada so my idea was that we would contribute equal percentage from our income for our shared expenses, and we handle the rest ourselves (to each their own money) - however she&#x27;s not happy with it. She thinks that since I make more, I should contribute more than her since I will have a lot more money left. Is this the norm for a Viet girl? House chores we share 50/50 (I&#x27;d often do more because I want to) and everything else is equal but she won&#x27;t budge about this part.
 Everyone is completely misunderstanding my point. We aren&#x27;t doing the 50/50 split. I pay over 70% of everything. What I suggested was we both put half of our income into a shared account from which we would pay for our expenses. The idea of each of us having separate money to handle for ourselves was from her. The point here is that she thinks I should put more than half my money and she less so, so that what&#x27;s left to each of us is more or less equal. She also wants to keep her job and not have children for at least another 7-8 years.

                              <span>I am currently working on an art piece for my father who is from Ho Chi Minh. For part of the piece I wish to incorporate a phrase in Vietnamese. However, I lost the language when I was very young and can&#x27;t ask my father for help as I want it to be a surprise! I was hoping someone could help me with an accurate translation, it would mean the world. The phrase is simple but I don&#x27;t want to leave it to a translating program:
 &quot;Always remember who you are&quot;
 This phrase holds a deep personal meaning associated with my father and I. However, the exact wording or translation can be flexible depending on what translates the best. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

But sometimes it is just not possible to communicate whatever options there are using gestures. The thing is, i am an adventurous eater and genuinely don&#x27;t care what i get on my plate. The weirder the better. 
 So i&#x27;m looking for a phrase in vietnamese to express &quot;I like everything&quot; or &quot;it does not matter, there is no food i don&#x27;t like&quot;. Any help would be much appreciated :)

                              <span>At school I&#x27;m currently doing a unit on countries in the Francophonie, and first on the list is Vietnam. So from what we&#x27;ve discussed in class so far not a lot of people speak french, but it seems that it&#x27;s still used to some degree by the government, which seems odd to me. But more importantly my teacher believes that french in Vietnam is like the language of power, you learn it if you want to be a politician and are seen as a power seeker if you&#x27;re learning the language. This doesn&#x27;t seem right to me based off of the basic knowledge of Vietnamese history I have, so am I right, is she wrong?

                              <span>Hello! Not sure if this is a typical question, but I am an English teacher and I have a Vietnamese student who is still learning English. I was hoping someone could help me translate the two words below to help him during our lesson? Google translate won’t work for these, I think. 
 Will: the one that is someone’s last dying wish, not the verb 
 Work: as in ‘things will work out,’ not like a job or to work. If you could tell me how to say the sentence “we’ll find something that works” I’d also really appreciate that! 
 If anyone knows how to say these things in Vietnamese I’d be sooo grateful!

                              <span>Good morning from America! I was offered a position at a School called Aston, apparently an English teaching school for elementary kids. They&#x27;re in HCMC and Can Tho. My question is, how reputable is it, and is it viewed positively or negatively compared to RES? It gives me housing + 10m vnd + stipend so I&#x27;m really leaning into it.

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 I would like to get advice from you. I highly appreciate your polite comments and valuable advice. I&#x27;ve wanted to work as a freelance. I&#x27;m tired of working in the office with dramas and I&#x27;d like to be flexible so Freelance is my top choice. I&#x27;ve worked as an English teacher and content creator before. I am trying my best to learn more about digital marketing and photoshop for my future. 
 I created my Upwork account and tried my best to apply and get proposals but there was no result. I was upset a little bit. my parents are older and they often get sick so I&#x27;d like to push myself in working freelance. Should I still look for a job patiently or get some free work and then get a rate? 
 I can write English articles, create content on social media and get a good boost. Would you like to recommend me anything? I&#x27;m pleased to listen from you guys! Thanks in advance!
 Bonus: my house is noisy so I can&#x27;t teach English at home or work as n English tutor. And I&#x27;d like to manage social media than teaching kids.

                              <span>Hey I&#x27;m a german middle eastern girl and I really want to learn vietnamese in order to better communicate with my boyfriends mother. He is from Hanoi and I really want to learn vietnamese with the nothern accent but all apps seem to be in the southern accent, which is way different than what he speaks. I already learned a lot about his culture, and we often find a lot of similarities. He is very interested in mine and I want to show him how important he is to me as well! Thank you all🌸
 EDIT: I seemed to have open a big discussion 😭 I said/made this post because whenever I learn with my boyfriend, or try to practice myself I send him the things, thats when he tells me that they don&#x27;t say it that way/ use different words or that the pronounciation is more southerly than northern. I don&#x27;t ever want to offend anyone. I just want to be able to communicate with his mom!💗 thanks for the great advice!
