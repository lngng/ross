                              <span>Hi, anyone here knows how to get from Võ Văn Tần, Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam to Dai Nam Go kart Theme Park? 
 I plan to rent a motorcycle, but I&#x27;m scared of being stopped by officers on the road. I have license, but I&#x27;m from a different country.
 ​
 Question is:
 - How to get there if I&#x27;m not going to use a rented motorcycle?
 - Is it safe to just go there using a rented motorcycle?
 - Should I book from taxi mobile application? 
 - Is commute an easy way?
 ​
 Thank you so much, Peeps!

                              <span>I am planning to arrive in HCMC tomorrow for 2 weeks with additional week in Da Nang. Seek your quick advice:
  
SIM Card?: I have been suggested its better to not buy at the airport. Plan is to get a Grab to my hotel, check in, and then find some shop for SIM Card. However, can you recommend which SIM Card/company is better? (Just want reliable internet/data)
 
Where to exchange currency?: While airport is a no go (will exchange just enough for taxi and check in), curious if there&#x27;re any specific places with great exchange rates? (Eg. SuperRich in Bangkok is known for its highly competitive exchange rate). 
 
 Or Is it feasible to withdraw money from the ATM? (Again, eg. in Bangkok, you are charged 220 THB right away for every ATM withdrawal so unless you&#x27;re withdrawing chunk of cash, its just dropping money on avoidable)
  
Worth it to drive moped/bike to get around? For reference, I have driven in South Asia so I am quite used to...uh, interesting drivers.

                              <span>I have spent the last 18 days traveling across your country and absolutely love it. I am leaving tomorrow from Hanoi, and am hoping to stock up on a bunch of coffee to take home, but am a little stumped on where to go. Any recommendations on places to go, or specific types of beans? I’d like to buy a good amount, but not break the bank. Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>So! My factory has cats, and ants flock to our auto feeder that plugs in to feed them.
 Anyone know where in hcmc i can maybe buy something to stop it?
 Ive read about motes, not sure i can use it/make one that isnt too high. My cats are small still so they may not reach or knock it over trying to get high enough.
 I figured maybe someone in VN has the same problem and found a good way to stop, or bought something?

 ​
 So some background information. I&#x27;m an American who got a B.S. Electrical Engineering degree back in 2016. After school I ended up hating electrical engineering and took a job working in media out of college, but I hated that too. Then in early 2020 I switched careers to IT and got a bunch of basic IT certifications. I have been working as IT support for the last 3 years. I am by no means an IT expert, but I at least have some idea of what I&#x27;m doing. I also enjoy the work that I do and enjoy learning new skills, which in the IT industry, there seems to be a never ending…</span>

 Appreciate any information on this.

 What fees are there? 
 Is it flat-rate or percentage? 
 Any currency conversion fees? 
 Is the sender or the receiver charged the fees?

                              <span>I left my phone in my grab at around 1am. I’m able to track it using my work phone and have been following it for most of the night.
 I set my phone as lost on ‘Find My iPhone’ with the following message Chiếc iphone này bị bỏ lại sau khi nhặt, vui lòng gọi (dads phone number here) để trả lại càng sớm càng tốt hoặc chuyển đến Fusion Suites Sài Gòn or WhatsApp (my phone number here, as I have WhatsApp on this phone instead of my personal)
 The best part is that as soon as I did that the driver did actually call my dad but unfortunately due to language constraints between the two they weren’t able to communicate effectively. 
 What’s frustrating though is that since then I have tried to call my phone multiple times and the driver has refused to pick up. 
 I have tried reaching out to grab via their helpline but the phone line keeps getting disconnected. I am also unable to sign into my grab account on this second phone as I need Facebook 2FA and the code generator is on my personal phone. 
 Just looking for advice, support, next steps or others who have faced something similar I guess. 
 I’m worried that the phone will eventually die and I will no longer be able to track it and then all hope is lost lol.

                              <span>Hey so I really need some advice, I’m currently in the USA I am a social worker, attempting to work with a Vietnamese family.
 Already there is a language barrier they speak very little English and when I try to use a translator it seems to upset them and they try to communicate with me in small phrases but obviously I lose meaning of what they try to say and they lose meaning of what I try to say.
 So far he has gotten mad at me twice, one for walking upstairs wit my shoes on and another by attempting to contact his wife without going through him.
 At this point I think I’m just culturally missing some elements that he is starting to take as disrespect, I have to talk to them again at their house in a few days and I’m not trying to get cursed out again in Vietnamese pls help.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;ll be moving to Saigon soon (district 1) and I was wondering if you can recommend stores in the area where I could buy some home essentials like small electronic appliances, kitchen utensils, bedsheets, towels, etc.
 Also, are there any supermarkets in district 1 where I could find Western products and ingredients? I have a senstitive stomach, so I might need some type to adapt..
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi people! This is my first time ever creating a post in Reddit. After searching through the internet I couldn&#x27;t find an answer for this question.
 How do you respond in Vietnamese when you get compliments appearance wise?
 I&#x27;m half Chinese and half Vietnamese living in Europe. In China you don&#x27;t really say thank you. You just downplay it or deny it playfully.
 I grew up ugly so I never had this encounter but now as an adult I have gotten couple compliments. I just don&#x27;t know how to answer other than giggling and shaking my head. Thank you for the help. ❤️

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am visiting HCMC in early June, partially as a vacation but partially to learn more about the local scene for entrepreneurs and freelancers. I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I&#x27;m strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.
 As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I&#x27;m not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.
 Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats? Anyone here running their own small business or online business in Vietnam and would like to meet for a coffee or beer?
 Thanks for reading!

 I am currently travelling around Vietnam with my girlfriend and we are in Ninh Binh where it is raining today tomorrow with some thunderstorms(apparently) and I am just wondering what are common indoor activities or that when it is raining so much?
 Is it similar to other countries like bowling/cinema in bigger cities or is there some more localised activities?
 If anyone has any suggestions for Ninh Binh I&#x27;d be very thankful but it just made me think about everywhere else around the country too.

                              <span>Hi I know this topic has been asked many times about tailor recommendations in Hanoi, but I am specifically looking to tailor a female suit and most of the recommendations seem to only do men suits.
 Does anyone have any recommendations? I&#x27;ll only be there for 5 days so it&#x27;ll have to a quick one as well.

                              <span>Hi! I’m a computer scientist graduate looking to relocate from the UK to Vietnam in September. 
 I have almost 2 years internship experience with multinational corporations on top of my degree. I’m mostly interested in positions involving cloud, DevOps, networking and operating systems, rather than full time software development. 
 How easy would it be for a non Vietnamese graduate to find an entry level position? What would a reasonable monthly wage be? I’ve seen positions ranging from $900-2500, and was wondering what an acceptable range for negotiation would be. Lastly, are there any specific websites I can look for jobs? I’ve currently just been using LinkedIn, Glassdoor and indeed. 
 Thank you in advance for your help 🙏

                              <span>I arrived a few days ago and bought my SIM card at the airport. It’s 4GB/day with calling. 
 Randomly during the day my service will completely stop working. It’ll last for hours before it starts again. I’ve turned off my VPN, restarted my phone, turned on/off airplane mode. Nothing works. 
 Is this common and how do I fix it?

 I want to learn Vietnamese as well as the history of the country, yet it is very difficult to find content due to me not being able to read Vietnamese. Is there any form of media anyone can recommend? Please help! Thanks.

                              <span>Is it worth to travel by train in Vietnam? How is the comfort and are delays common or are most train in time? Would like to take a train from Central Vietnam to HCM (about 12 hours ride) and take a plane from there later. Found a coonection with 4 hours arrival in HCM before the plane leaves. Is that a possible thing to do or do I need a lot of luck?
 Option b would be to arrive early in HCM airport and stay there over night, though not sure if thats recommended.

                              <span>I was on Ta Hien street last night and was planning to just walk (ten minutes) to the hotel but the obnoxious cab drivers would not stop pestering me so I just took a taxi. I told the driver my hotel name and he started driving and then takes me to like four different hotels and each time I say this is not my hotel.
 Finally he asks to use my phone for google maps and I hate handing my phone over but was tired and starting to feel sick. I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn&#x27;t hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.
 He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn&#x27;t) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn&#x27;t even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.
 POLICE are zero help because I don&#x27;t remember the drivers cab number. Is there ANYTHING I can do? My phone is not showing on the findmyiphone app.

                              <span>So I often get these friend requests from attractive looking Vietnamese female profiles on Facebook. Sometimes they are from Vietnam and sometimes they are in the US. They would chat with me and reveal their scam by trying to get me to sell random stuffs for them on some scam sites that give them commissions. I think they themselves believe that those scam sale sites are legit. 
 Another scam is they say they trade options to make money on the side and can help me make money, I never let it go further than that so I don’t know exactly how they do it. However, 90% of them would just chat and talk to me for weeks and months. I entertain them and keep talking to them to see what the scam is but it never comes. I talk to them like a normal respectful person but never show them that I am thirsty. Eventually they just stop talking to me. 
 The one thing in common I noticed is that they would edit old photo posts from months and years ago. Why do this? Is it their way of establishing that the profile is legit because they have posts from years ago? Is there ever a legit reason for someone to edit photos from a couple years ago? I am just trying to understand what is it they want from me or what kind of scam it is because it is a lot of time and efforts they go through. Thank you guys.

                              <span>The past 3 times I have used Grab for a ride I have had issues finding the driver.
 I am always very careful when inputting the pickup address and drop a pin exactly where I am on the map. But when I go to find them I am walking up and down the street and can&#x27;t see them.
 I have a 4G sim. Am I doing something wrong or is the app location a bit off sometimes?

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping this is the right place to ask - I&#x27;m looking for a European based Vietnamese teacher to help me improve my Vietnamese. I lived in Hanoi for a couple of years where my learning was very minimal and since moving back to Europe, I would like to improve my level. 
 I take online lessons but the time zones make it a bit difficult with a teacher based in Vietnam, so it limits my lessons to an hour a week.
 If anyone here knows anyone that would be able to help me, or point me in the right direction, that&#x27;d be perfect. They don&#x27;t need to be a qualified teacher, just someone who I could practice with, and is able to explain about the grammar/pronunciations aspects.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m in Vietnam for the second time, I last visited 7 years ago. I could have sworn that pho bo was almost always served with mint on the side. I&#x27;ve been here nearly a month and haven&#x27;t seen a single mint leaf in the dish or on the plate on the side... 
 Did I create a false memory in my head or something? It&#x27;s driving me crazy!
 I&#x27;ve been in Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An and Da Lat if that helps. Is it a regional thing?

                              <span>I currently own a full driving license (UK) with an &#x27;AM&#x27; category.
 I plan to hire a 110cc moped as I do not have any manual motorbike experience.
 Will I require an International Driver&#x27;s Permit like some site suggest or a category &#x27;A&#x27; on my UK license?

                              <span>I plan to do a lot of riding, some hiking, and lots of walking through towns and cities. Also, I&#x27;m guessing its unsafe to leave your bag on your bike as you explore, would that be correct?
 EDIT: I am asking here because of size of moto/culture of leaving stuff on the bike, etc.
 Any insights appreciated, thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving to Hanoi this summer and am looking to play some football (soccer) when I have the chance. What soil do people in Hanoi usually play on? Real grass, turf or something else? So I can get appropriate footwear before arriving.
 Thanks!

 Mình cần giúp tìm bài nhạc mà mỗi lần xe tải lùi về là sẽ nghe được. Bài nhạc nghe như “lá la la la là, là lá la la là lá là là la”.

                              <span>I LOVE Vietnamese food and have been indulging in every dish I can find. However, both me and my gf noticed we have extremely smaller appetites here as compared to home (USA).
 I suppose I&#x27;ve been doing slightly less excercisey things (i.e no lifting weights) but we still walk probably a couple miles a day. Plus, I feel like I can go into bottomless pit mode at home when I&#x27;m just being a couch potato. 
 Anyone else experience this? For the record, I eat a relatively healthy diet back in the states so I dont think it&#x27;s due to me consuming less processed foods.

                              <span>Hey, Unfortunately my camera cap for my lense (Sony 55mm)is broken and I need a new cap. Even though I went to several camera stores in Hanoi, I didn&#x27;t find such a cap. Does anyone know a store in Hanoi, which sells such caps? The lense is a Sony 3.5-5.6 / 18-135 and diameter is 55mm. Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Just wondering what all youth sports are available in VN, specifically in Đà Nẵng. I figured football is likely the most popular. Other than basketball, what other team sports is common? What about individual sports? We’re moving there soon and trying to see what will be available for my boys. They’re currently in baseball, soccer/football, and folkstyle wrestling. Doesn’t look like they’ll have access to wrestling from my limited research. What about baseball? Thanks for any info/suggestions!

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m coming to Vietnam soon and I was hoping to do a three-day long Halong bay cruise at the end of April. I&#x27;ve been browsing various websites, but it seems that most of them charge quite hefty for a single person ($600+). Is that price normal? Is there a way to find more affordable Halong bay cruise?

Thank you for your help.
 The note:

                              <span>As I travel from south to north in Vietnam, I’m starting to run out of time in the north. And I really enjoy the north. I’m pretty bummed that I spent time wasted in Mūi Né. The beaches had trash, most restaurants were tourist traps with insanely small portions, and there was little to no culture. I guess the only plus is that it made me realize how much I absolutely love Dalat, Hôi An, and Phong Nha.

Would be VNMese-English, up to 3 hour-long interviews/day. Including travel time etc, likely to be 5-10 full days of work in total.

                              <span>Hi! Me and my girlfriend are spending a week in Vietnam during the first week of august. I understand this is raining season. While looking for the best places to stay during raining season I came across Cat Ba Island. Beautiful area, less touristy then Halong Bay while still having plenty of restaurant options and other things to do. 
 However, when looking at the weather forecast for august it says there could be monsoons and very heavy rain. Is this still doable or would it be cloudy and raining for most of the day? 
 Other suggestions are also really appreciated!
 Thanks

                              <span>According to the report by Vietnam Ministry of Health, as of April 10, 2023, there has been a sudden increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country, and Hanoi is currently leading in the number of new cases. 
 There has been a significant increase in the number of Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals, and many of them require oxygen support, especially the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.
 So, should we worry about the new wave of Covid-19?

                              <span>I always used this term in order to refer to the Vietnamese fighters from the second world War, I&#x27;m actually a big fan of Vietnam because they were brave enough to defeat world power countries in many wars protecting the territory against the invasors, however I was talking to my teacher who is a history scholar and he said that this term is racist. 
 I was confused because I always considered it a sort of Pride specially because here in south America as the history of Vietnam has always been a inspiration for us. 
 I&#x27;m also quite embarrassed, I have a friend from Vietnam and I&#x27;ve been using this term for a while, well this friend never said anything against it, this is what makes me even more confused.

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering Lasik eye surgery in Saigon. The last post here re Lasik was a few years ago and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has had the procedure done more recently than that? Cao Thang Eye Hospital looks good.
 Hoping to get recommendations for hospital and costs as well as actual recovery time and follow up appointments.
 As a solo traveller is the recovery something that you can get through on your own? Is it as simple as having a hotel to stay at for the following night and arranging a lift from the hospital back to the hotel?
 What about follow up appointments, I&#x27;m not overly keen on staying in HCMC for too long. How about heading to Danang the following day and checking back in at HCMC on the way back to flying out? Were you able to swim and ride a motorbike after the procedure? I think swimming is not recommended. Just wondering what to do in recovery I guess.

                              <span>I’ve seen so many celebrities and people with cars in Vietnam posting videos of themselves and their kids with no car seat at all in the car. Isn’t that very dangerous for kids? Why isn’t anyone considered of car seats? Is there no laws about it? Just curious.

I wanted to buy some t shirts, the shop keepers were extremely rude and gestured me to get out. 😥Honestly confused as all other markets have been wonderful. Why were they so aggressive when there was still time for the market to close.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have a question about buying a DJI mini 3 pro with the RC and Fly more kit plus in Vietnam. I&#x27;ll be visiting the country in about a month and I&#x27;m wondering how much it would cost to buy this product in a local store. Unfortunately, I cannot order it from the official DJI site because I&#x27;ll be moving around a lot.
 Can anyone recommend the best stores to go to for purchasing this drone in Vietnam? Also, I&#x27;m a bit concerned about the legality of flying drones in Vietnam. What happens if the police catch you with a drone? Is it illegal to fly drones in certain areas of the country?
 Thank you for your help and advice in advance. I&#x27;m really looking forward to my trip to Vietnam and I&#x27;d love to capture some amazing footage with my new drone.

                              <span>We arrived in Halong bay yesterday and we are so confused as to why there are literally no tourists and not even that many locals. It’s a place that we can see has many large buildings at the facilities for so many tourists but there’s no one here it’s like a ghost town? My research told me it was going to be absolutely packed full and we have just driven around and seen hardly anyone. Any explanations?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My fiancée and I are planning to take a trip out to Nha Ttrang in September/October. My company does not give me much vacation time - only 3 weeks a year - so for this trip, I am only looking to spend about 7-ish days in VietNam, with a few of them specifically in Nha Trang.
 I make a fairly good income at my job - just shy over $100K USD - and I&#x27;m not reluctant to spend $130-$180 a night at a nice hotel with my fiancée. Unfortunately we are in the process of waiting for a Visa, so do not see one another that frequently. My fiancée doesn&#x27;t care too much about fancy accommodations since she grew up fairly frugal, but I don&#x27;t mind spending the extra $$ because I&#x27;m a little spoiled.
 Anyways, what is everyone&#x27;s favourite luxury hotel in Nha Trang? We we will be taking a flight from HCM. The 40-50min drive from the airport isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, so the hotel does not necessarily need to be in a convenient in-between location from airport and the night market.
 We&#x27;ve looked up a few spots already; Queen Ann, Ariyana SmartCondotel, and Panorama by HLG.
 The biggest thing I&#x27;m looking for is a comfortably-sized shower for additional intimacy.

 Alternatively have you seen any bone broth products in stores that are local and not imported. I would assume I can find some imported products at Anan (I’m in HCM) but would rather opt for a local product.

                              <span>Hi, I am planning for a 20-30days trip to Vietnam sometime in May/June/July.
 I hope to do a work away during my time there to fully experience the culture there. In short, it is a platform that allows people to arrange homestays and cultural exchange. And volunteers can contribute a pre-agreed amount of time per day in exchange for lodging and food, which is provided by their host. 
 Places of interest: Dalat, Sapa or Ha Giang. (Open to other places as well).
 Areas of interest or things I can contribute: Specialty coffee or any cafe, Coffee farms, Coaching competitive swimming or Learn to swim, Crossfit Gym or Commercial gym, Teaching English/Mandarin/Maths/ Sciences.
 Feel free to PM to understand more. Thanks!

                              <span>Apologies if this is a silly question, but I&#x27;m looking to expat in a couple of years and I want to begin building a network before I do so. I was wondering, are there any social networking sites that will help me reach people in Vietnam? I&#x27;ve tried a few, but the sites I&#x27;ve used (Facebook, for example) just keep suggesting people in my home country. Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

                              <span>My Vietnamese friends told me that Vietnam has a high HIV rate. Drug users use needles and infect each other with HIV. Then they have sex with hookers which spreads more HIV. Customers that see hookers spread HIV to their wives etc. Is this true? 
 HIV rate in Vietnam seems very high compare to South Korea or Japan. Let me know what you think as a local Vietnamese. 
 (Vietnam also has a high cancer rate but I&#x27;ll make another thread on that)

                              <span>Just wanted to hear thoughts of those outside of western worlds.
 Australia getting pretty grim with high interest rates and corporate owned houses for renting, rich boomer generation buying multiple houses to rent out and rich overseas investors buying 5+ houses to rent out. A lot more homeless around nowadays. 
 But our salaries are alright, even a waiter can afford a house if we save good for 3-5 years, we could probably get a mortgage that will take a life time to pay off.
 I went over to vietnam and found out that salaries can be 250k to 500k VND, depending on location. But the property prices are equivalent to USA and Aus. 
 Not everyone will have corporate jobs or be in a financial situation to afford these prices.
 How is it looking for those who are starting from scratch? No family to assist, just a normal everyday job.

                              <span>I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China&#x27;s actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can&#x27;t expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn&#x27;t know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

                              <span>Hi there!
 After searching the subreddit, I&#x27;ve seen several questions about short layovers in HCMC (5-6 hours max). Most of the consensus I&#x27;ve read is that Tan Son Nhat makes that short of a stopover risky, and best to stay in the airport. However, in June I&#x27;ll be flying in on my way back to Australia and I&#x27;ll have 10 hours of stopover time from landing to the next departure.
 I already went ahead and got a visa, so that should speed things up. If I factor in 30 min to 1 hour for customs, another 30 minutes or so into the city centre via taxi, and then 30 min to get back to the airport 3 whole hours before my international departure, that still leaves me with potentially 5 hours in HCMC. Worth it in my book! I never thought I&#x27;d get to set foot in Vietnam so I&#x27;m excited to take the opportunity.
 Where&#x27;s the best area to wander for 5-ish hours in HCMC? Try some local Vietnamese dishes, get a bit of a sense of what the city is like, any quick interesting sights, etc. I&#x27;ll be there on a Friday if that makes a difference for any markets or things that will be open.
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>This was the 3rd Mongol invasion of Vietnam, along the Bạch Đằng river. The Viets positioned themselves in small flotilla along the river, and made a false retreat drawing the Mongol fleet into the trap.With the Yuan fleet trapped, the Vietnamese junks armed with bombs, attacked them from all sides. Many of the Mongols jumped into the river to save themselves were killed or drowned. The Viet captured around 400 Yuan warships.
 This victory effectively put an end to the Mongol invasions of Vietnam, though the Viet monarch Trần Nhân Tông, decided to accept the supremacy of Kublai Khan to avoid further conflicts.The failure of the Mongol invasions was however a shattering blow for their supremacy in Asia, and Vietnam&#x27;s success gave more confidence to the other Asian nations to halt the once invincible Mongol juggernaut.

                              <span>So, a couple of days ago, there was an article in vn express about how slow the immigration and baggage claim process is at the 2 big airports. I experienced that when I landed in Hanoi in late October 2022. The arrival hall was totally packed. About an hour until I got through.
 I’m wondering if anyone has experience arriving in Da Nang instead. I looked around online and there isn’t much in the way of comments about it.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Base on a article on “Tuoitre” According to the explanation of the Chairman of Hoi An City Nguyen Van Son, the revenue from entrance tickets serves the conservation, embellishment and restoration of monuments, renovating the infrastructure in the old quarter, and organizing events. tourism events, as well as supporting people in home renovation and renovation, etc. At the same time, it is compulsory to buy tickets for all visitors when visiting Hoi An ancient town to ensure fairness for the locality and visitors. 
 Ticket prices are issued at 120,000 VND/ticket for international visitors and 80,000 VND/ticket for domestic visitors. Such a two-price policy that distinguishes between domestic and foreign people, dating back several decades, is completely out of line with international practices. 
 There are two types of spaces that need to be clearly defined, where the proposed toll is public space or owned space (eg museums, monuments...). If the space is owned, the owner has the right to collect a fee. On the contrary, if it is a public space, it belongs to the whole people, belongs to everyone, and has no right to collect fees. 
 Hoi An sells entrance tickets, in the case of legality, on the one hand, it brings the city&#x27;s budget but on the other hand increases the cost of tourists.
 I strongly think this is a step back for Hoi An tourism some Comment I ever read even said don’t turn “Hội An” to “Hội Ăn”

I read some horror stories online about drone confiscation at Da Nang airport, and I’m really afraid for my drone now. I always keep the batteries separate (they are my powerbank when traveling) and I’m flying domestic, I have never heard any issues with domestic flights but I just wanted to be sure.

                              <span>Hello! I am a child of Vietnamese immigrants. I can speak and understand a bit of Vietnamese. I wish I could understand more of it, to surpass my family&#x27;s language barrier.
 Please recommend me some Vietnamese songs!! I must say that I am not a fan of the Vietnamese music genre(???). You know! Long, drawn-out words with vibrato, sung along with some sort of stringed instrument (sorry mom!!!). 
 I want songs with Vietnamese lyrics, but in another style. Rock &amp; Pop-Rock are my preferred genres. Fast, upbeat! And I don&#x27;t care what the lyrics say as long as they are in Vietnamese. 
 Artists/Projects I like: Kagerou Project, Weezer, Wallows, Sex Bob-Omb 
 Please do recommend me something!!! Thank you :D
 edited to change pop to pop-rock*

                              <span>I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China&#x27;s actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can&#x27;t expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn&#x27;t know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

 I feel weak.
 I realize my nutrition levels are low. 
 I do not speak Vietnamese. 
 Since I am eating Vietnamese food only
 So I need to seek a registered dietician in Vietnam to discuss a nutrition plan and diet. 
 If I seek a registered dietician in the west, they might not be familir with the food here. 
 Are there good English-speaking registered dieticians in Vietnam that can help me with a nutrition plan and diet? 
 Thanks!

 I do not have time to cook my food.
 I just go to cheap shops or street food.
 In the street, I see them offering food like rice, fish, chicken, etc.
 When I walk in the street, I just eat the food. 
 In the English speaking Countries, it is not recommend to eat outside due to how processed and expensive the food it is.
 Here in Vietnam, the food is so cheap. However, is the food healthy? Do they use cheap oil to cook? Do they use a lot of oil?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am travelling to Vietnam in 15 days and I want to book up meetings with potential wholesale suppliers for my business. ITs impossible to find them on google, therefore came here for a more targeted list. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello People,
 I recently moved to Hanoi, Vietnam, to start a new chapter here. I love this place so much but I find myself often confused on how many options I have for grocery shopping, and it got me thinking about where could I find the best prices of groceries in spite of being a foreigner. I have got some names of some supermarkets but I was wondering If I could go even cheaper to buy groceries. If anyone here has any idea I would really appreciate it and hopefully others coming to Vietnam can benefit from this post if someone drops any value here.
 Thank you and have a nice day

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to Vietnam on holiday for a few weeks and would really like to bring something back for the Vietnamese people who work in my nail salon and their families. I don&#x27;t know any of them on a friend basis but really love them and they rarely get to go back. If I ask them what they&#x27;d like me to bring back, they&#x27;d say nothing, so just wondered if there&#x27;s some kind of very popular and loved chocolate / snack etc that I could bring back for them?

                              <span>In the time I’ve been here in Vietnam, I’ve come across Falun Gong/Falun Dafa a surprisingly high number of times, including meeting one man who practiced this who spoke English and was able to actually tell me something about this group. 
 Being from the UK, I can’t say I’ve had much actual experience with what Falun Gong is beyond the whole China situation, which as you can imagine often attracts a lot of negativity and general bad feeling. 
 I’m wondering how Falun Gong is actually viewed by Vietnamese people. I’m guessing given the amount of times I’ve come across practitioners, it’s viewed more favourably than it is in the UK or other places.

                              <span>I will be flying to Bangkok tomorrow and just realized that I still have more than 1 million VND left. Since ATM fees in BKK are quite high anyway, I thought about exchanging my VND stock. Which would be the way of minimized loss? Exchange VND in BKK or at Hanoi airport? Or maybe change to USD in Hanoi and then to Baht in Bangkok? Happy about helping input!

                              <span>I am currently in Vietnam and need help getting a book. The book is &quot;This One Wild and Precious Life: The Path Back to Connection in a Fractured World by Sarah Wilson&quot;.
 I can&#x27;t find it on any Vietnamese websites, so my question is, what are the best international websites to buy and ship to Vietnam. 
 My current plan is to order it to my home in the UK, and have someone ship it to me here, surely there is a better option. 
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been going out on dates here in HCMC with a girl who, though she has lived in HCMC since university, is originally from the city of Tay Ninh. Her family apparently follows Cao Dai. She herself says she has no religion, though she is quite interested in Buddhist philosophy and often reads Buddhist-flavored self-help books (like Thich Nhat Hanh and Haemin Sunim).
 Anyway, she&#x27;s incredibly kind, fun-loving, philosophical, selfless, and more. I&#x27;m just wondering whether coming from a family that follows Cao Dai is like the Vietnamese equivalent of a Mormon family, a Scientology family, or really just no big deal? Is there anything I should be aware of?

                              <span>Hi! I’m planning a trip this October to Vietnam with my boyfriend for our birthdays for about 2.5 weeks. His birthday is the 18th and mine the 24th! For additional context, He is a city guy and I’m more of a nature and landscape gal. We both like water. So based on that I was curious which itinerary anyone would anyone recommend in mid October taking into account the central region rainy season. We also want to ensure we have the most sun/best warm weather in the islands.
 I’m not sure on the amount of days yet in each place so any recommendations are welcome :) also are there any “must see” places I am missing that would fit into the below with the amount of time we have? Thank you!! 
 Itinerary 1 Land in Hanoi-&gt; Sapa-&gt; Halong Bay -&gt; hoian? (Not sure if I should avoid due to rain) Fly to Ho Chi Minh -&gt; Phu Quoc islands then back to Ho Chi Minh to fly home 
 Itinerary 2 Land in Hochiminh -&gt; Phu Quoc islands -&gt; back to Ho Chi Minh-&gt; fly to Hanoi -&gt; Sapa -&gt; Halong bay -Hanoi and any day trips from there then fly home from Hanoi

                              <span>Dear Reddit friends, first of all a big thanks for your helpful answers on my earlier questions about life in Hanoi/Vietnam!
 Next question, I understand that tab water in Hanoi is not clean enough to drink and that there was even an scandal in 2019. Since I drink a lot of water, try to avoid plastic bottles and will stay around four years, I&#x27;m considering buying a more heavy duty purifier, such as the Bluewater Spirit. https://www.bluewatergroup.com/product/bluewater-spirit/
 Does anyone have experience using such products in Hanoi/Vietnam? Or are there better local options? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello guys, I hope you&#x27;re doing well, I have a small inquiry concerning labor law and contract in Vietnam, my question is if the employer ( the school) wants to terminate the contract, don&#x27;t they have to compensate anything to the teacher? And after the termination, does the teacher have to do a visa run to start a new job with a different school or doesn&#x27;t have to exit and reenter Vietnam? Thank you in advance

 It was successful then so I&#x27;ll try it again. I&#x27;m in the technical world with some experience in building marketplaces and I&#x27;m back in Vietnam to do it all over again. I would love to meet up with any fellow Entrepreneurs, techies or any overall cool people. I&#x27;ll be in District 1 from April 11-20 - so let&#x27;s grabs beers! -Allan

                              <span>Hello fellow travellers and locals. I am currently spending my last days in Vietnam after a 3,5 week long journey from north to south and never tried Hot Pot before. Do you have any recommendations for a good Hot Pot in Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon? Preferable in District 1 but I could also take a Grab so tell me everything :) Thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>The two eastern divisions (north-east: Sylhet, south-east: Chittagong) of Bangladesh (preferably, I&#x27;d want the whole of Bangladesh to join, but idk...) to join Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to form one single united country (you may look at the map of Asia for some context if you want). I&#x27;d preferably want there to be two capitals, the western capital and the eastern capital, The western capital could be either Sylhet or Chittagong (Chattogram) and the eastern capital could be either Bangkok or Hanoi. I personally think that it would be great. I mean, look at India, it has different cultures and languages/language-families (Indo-European, Dravidian etc.).. I want these countries that I mentioned to be one country for the greater good (of humanity). Even if they were to merge, they would not be as big in size as China, India or the USA but they would be bigger in size than as they are presently.These countries that I mentioned are all connected by land, not just the water (for some more context, for those reading and looking to get it). If anyone else on here who sees this also wants this to happen, please feel free to give some suggestions and let&#x27;s gather some ideas on seeing if this could actually go forth.
 P.S.: I haven&#x27;t thought of a name for the proposed country yet.

                              <span>I am visiting Vietnam for a school internship in a few weeks and my teachers asked to bring gifts for a student we are paired with. They said that they themselves really didn’t know what to bring as gifts, and to avoid maple syrup products, since they really wouldn’t know what to do with it (I’m Canadian for context), but it was my only real idea lol. Do you have any ideas as to what to bring to my Vietnamese friend that he will definitely love? They recommended maybe a photo album of us and our families, is it a good idea? Also somethings I should avoid?

                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;m debating traveling for a few days to Hanoi at the end of June. Is the weather too miserable and rainy to visit at this time? I live in a nearby Asian country and thought I&#x27;d visit since I&#x27;ve always been wanting to go.
 Thanks!

So as for now my only option is to apply for 2 one-month options, and then exit the country and re-enter it. But the issue is that i also need a visa to be able to enter any country nearby, Laos,Cambodia,Thailand,etc :( Are there any other options that i am blind about?

                              <span>First of all I want to say after spending 2 of my 3 weeks in Vietnam so far it&#x27;s been great. I have spent time all over the country and have been to Ho Chi Minh, Da Lat, Nha Trang, Da Nang and Hoi An. Every city have had its unique feeling and I have loved it so far.
 Now I&#x27;m finally in Ha Long, this was supposed to be the real tropical paradise stop with beaches and swimming. Boating through the unique Islands in the bay and just relax before going to Hanoi for the flight back home. 
 I decided to go on a bot trip while in Ha Long and just enjoy the almost mystical atmosphere you get boating through the bay between hundreds of small rocky islands.But this absolutely broke my heart, instead of a mystical and paradise like environment we got nothing but waters absolutely full of trash. 
 It didn&#x27;t matter where you looked, it was just full of mostly styrofoam blocks and other plastic waste, but also some random wood and other garbage also floating around. And I&#x27;m not surprised that the waters are so littered, there where hundreds of tourist boats in the bay at any given time. Unfortunately this seem to partly be because of over tourism in the bay, and going through Ha Long city there seem to be alot of relatively new developments but 70% of it looked to be empty or abandoned. 
 I am just a tourist that get to see this city for a limited time, can anyone from the area tell me more about how you perceive the city&#x27;s and they bays development over the past few years. And if you have toured Ha Long just as me and have similar or very contrasting experiences, please share. 
 Love from Sweden 🇸🇪

                              <span>I did some googling but could not find much information on the characteristics of the Da Nang accent. I was wondering what the differences were between the Southern and Da Nang accents (what little I found says the Da Nang accent is more similar to the Southern accent than to the Northern). Can anyone give me the particulars? Thanks so much.

I will take a look for scenic spots absolutely, but would love to spend more time in local areas :D I&#x27;ve watched some Vietnamese food shows as well, OMG they are all just mouth-watering! Cant wait to try them all!
 Soooo any advice? Anything I should be cautious of? Any travel video channel recommended? How about the food? Anyway, feel free to share your experiences in Vietnam, whatever you think it&#x27;s worth being shared. Pleeeease drop your comment here. Many thanks! ✨

It sounds like Viettel has by far the best service, especially to more remote areas where I&#x27;ll be going. I&#x27;d like to buy a tourist eSIM directly from Viettel and found their site https://tourist.viettel.vn/ . Looks like I have to provide a lot of personal information (including passport photo) before they provide details. Anyone have experience with buying directly from this site? I wanted to check before I provide my personal info. Thanks!

I am asking because i want to respect the people i will meet when visit this country, and want to make sure i also follow their customs as a gratitude for welcoming me in their country! Thank you!

 I also have seen some English-speakers applying English pronunciation onto Vietnamese words and saying that the Vietnamese words doesn&#x27;t make sense.
 Can anyone explain these to me?

 What do men usually wear to Vietnamese weddings? And which colors are suitable, and which are not? And what kind of gifts do people bring to Vietnamese wedding?

                              <span>Has anyone been through the process of getting married in Vietnam as a foreigner (to a Vietnamese national)? I’ve been to my embassy for the affidavit confirming single status, had it notarised &amp; translated. The tricky one seems to be the paper confirming ‘mental fitness’ to enter a marriage. The international hospitals don’t seem to offer it. Even my Fiancée is struggling to get to the bottom of it so I turn to Reddit 😅

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 does anyone know, if it is possible to expand the permission to stay in vietnam? We got our visa to late and now we are in vietnam with the 15-day permit, that we can get with a german passport. Now we have got our 30 day visa, but the stamp in the passport says, that we have to leave Vietnam at the 12th April. We want to leave it at the 24th. Then we stayed here 28 days in total. Is it now possible, to expand the permission to stay with our visum without traviling outside of vietnam? Maybe at the immigration office in Hanoi? Has everyone tried that?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am *thinking* about taking an extended backpacing trip through Vietnam. I have never backpacked before so tbh I’m not even sure what that means. I am looking for any and all advice as I formulate my plan of travel. 
 Budgeting; if I am trying to keep it mid to low cost how much can I expect to pay per day? I found some posts that said 50$ a day would be sufficient if I stay in hostels, hitchhike, and take the bus places. (That was including lodging). Does this hold true?
 Things to do: as I have no idea what Vietnam is like i plan to soak up as much as possible. I’m told any and all caves are worth a visit. Is there anyone out there who has been to Vietnam before and is willing to share or send me their itinerary? I can taylor it to my needs but i would be forever greatful to you kind stranger. 
 If I want to travel to a different country after Vietnam has anyone had experience applying for a multi trip visa? (Google can probably answer that one for me but there’s nothing better than first hand knowledge).
 Any and all wisdom is greatly appreciated. I plan to Only bring a 40-50L backpack too. Is this feesable.? Experienced backpackers, any pointers on what I should pack and how many of each item? I tend to over pack so I would probably do 2 weeks worth of clothes if I can fit it in the backpack but if someone is able to get away with less then i‘d happily pack lighter.

                              <span>When on the road today around 8:30 AM the road was congested as always during this high traffic hour. A car tried to get by us by using the motorcycle lane. He honked and honked. While trying to pass us, the other car hit our side mirror. I could look into the other car and saw a young man in a military uniform looking very angry at us, like we were the inconvenience to him. After he passed by, I could see a red colored license plate. If I am not mistaken, that plate belongs to the military and is ranked the highest among other plates. After complaining to other people that an officer does not adhere to the law, they told me that those people ARE the law. Even normal police officers couldn’t do anything about it.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I want to learn a Vietnamese love song I can sing for my wife as a surprise anniversary present. 
 Some details about us: I am a foreigner and she is Vietnamese. We have been together for 7 years. We went broke together and came out of it doing well now. We have been through sickness (somewhat) and are in health. We use to fight about trivial matters and misunderstandings due to the language barrier but we learned to communicate better and rarely ever fight nowadays. We also have a daughter together and we are about to achieve our dream of owning our own house very soon. 
 Can you recommend me any Vietnamese love songs with lyrics or meaning similar to Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Thank you for loving me&quot;? 
 Really appreciate it!

Mình lên web đại sứ quán VN thì họ bảo phải nộp phí nhưng không nói rõ là bao nhiêu, gọi điện hỏi thì không ai nghe máy, email không ai trả lời, gọi hotline thì bị chửi, trên mạng thì mỗi chỗ báo 1 giá. Xin ai có kinh nghiệm xin gia hạn trong thời gian gần đây chỉ bảo với ạ 🥲 mình cảm ơn!
 I&#x27;m a student from VN currently living in the U.S. and my VN passport is nearing expiration so I have to renew it via mail. I looked at the embassy website and they said to submit a processing fee but didn&#x27;t specify how much. I tried to reach them by their regular phone number and email (no one answered/voicemail was full), and when I finally got through the hotline the guy who picked up just got mad at me lol. If you have experience applying for passport renewal recently please share how you did it/how much it cost. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello everyone! 👋
 Long story short, the hotel where I am going to stay in Hanoi in November gave me some good deals for a 2-day/1-night cruise on one of the ships mentioned in the title. The problem is that I can&#x27;t seem to figure out which one to choose...
 Le Theatre has a great dinner place with a piano and good outdoor areas on top, but I have seen comments about degradation problems and it not being very clean.
 Scarlet Pearl seems to be very new and clean, but it may have fewer outdoor areas...
 As for the itinerary, I think both are equivalent.
 Which one do you guys think I should choose?
 Thanks! 😁

 ​
 I know they just announced this but how would I pay for the fee to enter the town if I&#x27;m coming from the Da Nang airport around 9 p.m. and not entering the town until close to 10 p.m. if the ticket booths to enter the town close at 9:30 p.m.? How would I get to my hotel? Does my driver need to find a different route where I pay? Would the hotel help me?

                              <span>Có ai từng bị chính người nhà của mình bạo lực ngôn từ đến mức ám ảnh đến lúc bản thân đã trưởng thành không? Tôi thì có đấy. Tôi không tiện kể ở đây nhiều nhưng có một chuyện làm tôi nhớ mãi. Hồi nhỏ tôi rất thích xem các videos về DIY và thường rất táy máy làm theo, và thế là tôi lôi chiếc quần CŨ của mình ra để cắt tái chế thành một cái quần mới cho giống trên mạng, chuyện sẽ không có gì khi mẹ tôi phát hiện ra tôi cắt quần của mình và đi rêu rao với tất cả họ hàng là tôi rất rất hư, tôi học theo mấy con Đ.Ĩ trên mạng để trở thành những người như vậy (tôi thậm chí còn không mang cái quần đó ra đường). Và từ đó trở đi + nhiều chuyện nữa, tôi luôn có một nỗi lo với những người lớn tuổi hơn, tôi luôn ám ảnh việc người khác nghĩ gì về bản thân, tôi sợ người khác hiểu nhầm mình. Tôi luôn luôn mang trong mình một nỗi lo là tôi không giỏi, tôi không bao giờ được người khác công nhận, tôi không bao giờ được ai lắng nghe…

                              <span>I recently started dating an awesome Vietnamese guy. We get along great. I just had a couple questions on the best way to navigate a few cultural differences.
  
When we go out to eat, should I order my own food or just let him order and ask for extra plates?
 I have several mental health issues and my child is autistic. I am high functioning, receive mental health services, work full time and have full custody of my kids. I know it’s not appropriate to discuss emotions in many Asian cultures but I feel like it’d be the right thing to do to bring it up eventually. How should I do this? Should I be prepared for him to see me as weak and leave?
 What’s the best way to show him I care? My love language is touch but I wouldn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable in public. Would it be acceptable make a dessert for him? 
 What else do I need to know?
  
Thank you!!!

                              <span>Wanted to share this because there is almost zero criticism of this place anywhere I could find on the internet.
 We have spent two days here and have decided to abandoned ship and move on with the rest of the country. The main reason is that there is not much to do, and nowhere worth going to eat. 
 It obviously depends on what you like, but if it includes meat, you wont be getting that. Almost all meat here is not what it is advertised as, and will likely destroy your stomach the next day. We spent hours researching restaurants to eat at and compared to the rest of Vietnam, they are really quite pathetic. 4.7-5 star reviews on many restaurant are just an absolute joke. 
 Da Lat is a picturesque city with a nice climate this time of year. The hotels are all a bit tired and run down but that is to be expected considering the location. There are some nice bars hidden away for people to discover and you can do some small touristy activities like Crazy House, Coaster, Bike trips but that&#x27;s about it. 
 It is interesting that there are not many honest reviews containing criticism of any places in this country.

                              <span>Hello! My girlfriend is traveling in Vietnam and she is looking to buy some empty 100ml plastic bottles. 
 She wants to use these to fill so she can take some liquids on the plane. In Europe these small plastic bottles are sold at pharmacy and convenience stores but she is struggling to find them in Vietnam. 
 She will be in Hanoi so any specific store she could find it from there or any chain of a common store she could find such bottles at would be very helpful! 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Recently, it looks like the government is making a move to block people from having many phone numbers to prevent spam and scam calls. That&#x27;s good in theory. 
 I&#x27;m a foreigner living in Vietnam now for 8 years. I&#x27;ve had my phone number since the first day or two that I moved here. I thought I showed my passport at TheGioididong when I got the card. But I guess not. I don&#x27;t know. Apparently, I was never registered. 
 I did not pick up the random phone calls over the past week as it said, suspected spam. And then April 1st. I have no signal. I try everything with the sim and refresh the network to get it back.

                              <span>seeing as vietnamese has so many loanwords from french colonization, albeit with differences ofc in spelling and pronunciation, do you think a vietnamese speaker would have an easier time learning french than say, a japanese speaker, due to the linguistic influences? (for example sa bông for savon, etc) would some vocabulary or language be recognizable or instinctual, or not at all? anyone here who speaks or is learning both, do you find similarities in the two languages?

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t too long ago when Singapore was a &quot;backwater&quot; town. South Korea was poor from the war, just like what happened to Vietnam. They worked hard and now Singapore and South Korean are rich.
 Do you think Vietnam will be rich like Singapore or South Korea? Why or why not?
 As a white American, I think Vietnam has the potential to get rich but not too fast please.
 Edit: thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve been living here for over a year now and I&#x27;m curious to know what are some recommended insurance plans that other Americans use that won&#x27;t break the bank. When I first came here I had world nomads, but they turned out to be no good after I was hospitalised and didn&#x27;t plan on returning home anytime back to the states. They said that exempt me from getting my claim. Then I had Safetywing but they are more of a (you pay now and file a claim and we will send you the money later) kind of deal. I&#x27;m living in HCMC and am just looking for a good insurance plan I can rely on if I do get injured and I can just go to the hospital (Probably Vinmec) and just get helped on the spot no questions asked. Can anyone give me any recommendations?

                              <span>Planning on taking this trip today leaving from Hue.. I read the road was very steep getting into/out of the park and was wondering if anyone had done it on a motorbike and could tell me if it’s ok to attempt or I should just take a guided tour? I’m very experienced on a motorcycle for what it’s worth. 
 Cảm ơn!

                              <span>I&#x27;m Vietnamese and I&#x27;ve eaten Nem Chua all my life and I&#x27;ve recently realized that Lao and Thai people have a very similar raw fermented Sausage that is called Naem. Is this a cognate where the word (possibly origin?) comes from the same source or is a coincidence? Vietnamese considers a lot of &quot;sausage meat&quot; related food &quot;Nem&quot; like in Nem Nuong and Nem Ran and I&#x27;m not sure if Thai and Lao people consider other meat Nem/Naem like in Vietnamese. I&#x27;ve done some research and fermented sausage eaten raw is unique to South East Asia so it would make sense if they come from a similar origin somewhere in South East Asia as opposed to the cooked Lap Xuong that comes from China.

                              <span>Does anyone know about the cost of a check up? Just a tough estimate will do. I&#x27;m living in Hai Phong, if that helps. Thanks

                              <span>Im arriving to Hanoi with my girlfriend on may and we have to get to Ninh Binh from Noi Bai Airport. We will not be using public transport because we will be so tired after 20 hrs of flying. So what is the best way to get a trustful ride to Ninh Binh? What is a ok price? Ive looked up some companies to book in advance but didnt find too much info.

                              <span>So I made the mistake of buying a couple of 32&quot; suitcases which measure 159cm and the max allowed is 158cm...I expect them to be 160-162cm when full, unexpanded. I will be sure to keep them under 50lbs total which I&#x27;ve read should get a pass at most airlines. But how strict is Vietnam airlines on checked luggage size?

                              <span>Any travellers use either DEET or Picaridin? I know DEET is probably the most effective but it&#x27;s so harsh it can eat through synthetic fibers if you&#x27;re not careful. Has anyone tried Picaridin in Vietnam and does it work? I hear Picaridin doesn&#x27;t hurt synthetic fibers, is not oily and doesn&#x27;t smell. Or maybe a mixture of both DEET on your skin and Picaridin sprayed on your clothes?

 I am close to the manager (male) and he speaks English, but the owner is a lady who doesn&#x27;t. 
 I want to get them a small gift when I leave. Should I get the manager, owner, or both a gift?
 Do you have any ideas what I can get. 
 Thank you

Where do you go for such vaccinations and are they free or how much are each vaccinations for the baby in Vietnam? I hear better vaccination doses cost more?

                              <span>Hello everybody! 
 ​
 In May, I have a flight that will have a 6 hour layover in Ho Chi Minh airport.
 ​
 I was wondering if anybody could tell me if this would be enough time to at least visit the city center or some interesting areas nearby the airport or if this is not enough.
 ​
 I&#x27;m traveling on a Mexican Passport so I would need to process an E-Visa which is 25 USD, which is not a problem at all but if it&#x27;s not even enough time to visit the outsides I would rather just transit in the airport.
 ​
 Thank you all!

                              <span>even if i’m living in an area with many ethnic minorities including other viet ppl, i will constantly get asked if im chinese or taiwanese. both of my parents are from vietnam (and supposedly both ethnically vietnamese) but we usually get mistaken for chinese or other east asian by other viet ppl. one time in a pho restaurant the owner was speaking to other clients in vietnamese and then switched to english when we arrived, thinking we were chinese. i know we did share a lot of colonial history with china but i’m not sure what determines the stereotype of features/appearance nowadays. other than the idea of SEA being “more tan” are there any significant phenotypic differences between chinese and vietnamese people? do you ever get mistaken for one or the other?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m writing a Pokemon story where one of the regions is inspired by modern-day Vietnam, and I was wondering what elements of Vietnam would work well in Pokemon. This includes towns, cities, gyms, and The Elite Four. I came here because people on this subreddit know more about Vietnam than me. I take inspiration from other cultures in my writing so I can learn more about said cultures, and I don&#x27;t wanna accidentally offend anyone. If anyone has suggestions on what elements of Vietnam would work well in my Pokemon story, please comment them down below!
 Here are the gyms and elite four:
 Gyms:
 Gym 1: Poison
 Gym 2: Psychic
 Gym 3: Electric
 Gym 4: Ground
 Gym 5: Normal
 Gym 6: Rock
 Gym 7: Dragon
 Gym 8: Steel
 ​
 Elite Four:
 Elite 1: Dark
 Elite 2: Grass
 Elite 3: Fighting
 Elite 4: Fairy
 Champion: Ice

 As the title says, what&#x27;s something that might get my Hanoi friend to laugh and be confused by how I know that?
 It&#x27;s Monday there when I post this, so are there any good local memes?
  
Last year I started learning Russian for my friends in Kyrgyzstan. Now I&#x27;m also learning Vietnamese so I&#x27;ll be good when I visit.

                              <span>It’s been pretty long since I’ve been back to Vietnam. I’m 19 now and I know that the legal age has been set at 18, I still haven’t gotten my drivers license yet and low key forgot to get an id because I don’t really need anything in the us that would require an id. I know it’s a dumb question but like do most bars id now, when I go to Canada I never got id’d, so should I just lug around my passport or will I be set?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard great things about the coastal road near Danang, Hoi An and Hue but have reservations about biking it, as I have never ridden a motorcycle before. How safe is that particular bit of road for a very inexperienced rider? If it&#x27;s not safe what&#x27;s the best alternative to get those views?

                              <span>Hello all
 Me and my girlfriend are planning to visit your beautiful country this September. Probably from end of August till mid-September.
 However, I have found out that during this time Vietnam experiences relatively a lot of rain in some parts of the country. 
 We planned to visit Hanoi, Sapa, Ha long Bay, Ninh Binh, Hoi an, Hue and Phu quoc. Now I have read mixed information in the internet, so I thought I would ask maybe a local or someone who already visited Vietnam during this time period. Is end of August till mid-September a good time to visit these locations or which should I eventually skip?

                              <span>Em năm nay lớp 11, có chút năng khiếu vẽ vời, được sự ủng hộ từ gia đình nên hiện tại em đang học vẽ để thi năng khiếu.
 Ban đầu em có dự tính thi vào thiết kế đồ họa (em thích ngành này từ năm lớp 9) nhưng mà nghĩ lại và nghe mọi người khuyện nhủ thì em lại đang khá phân vân, liệu mình chọn ngành này sau này thu nhập có ổn định không, có đủ để gửi tiền hàng tháng về cho bố mẹ được không...có lẽ em thích là một chuyện nhưng nếu sau này ra trường lương lại ít hơn số tiền bỏ ra thì em thấy có lỗi với bố mẹ lắm ạ..
 Em đang phân vân giữa kiến trúc, ,thiết kế đồ họa, thiết kế nội thất. Ba ngành này em học ngành nào cũng được và sẽ quyết tâm đến cùng ( em có thế mạnh về vẽ và Toán Lý, biết sử dụng pts)
 Mọi người tư vẫn cho em với ạ
 em cảm ơn🌹

                              <span>We&#x27;re here as tourists and want to do some partying with locals, but all clubs we were to are really table focused, without a big dancefloor. People still dance, but at their table. We&#x27;ve been to HCM, Da Lat, Nha Trang and Quy Nhon. 
 Next up Danang if you have recommendations for bars and clubs? Unfortunately We&#x27;re there during the week, Tuesday to Thursday.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the fortunate ability to spend 4 months in Vietnam and have stayed with my wifes parents. Before departing, I wanted to give them a gift. My in-laws are a bit more than well off and would never accept my money. However, they&#x27;ve accepted my gifts before. Can natives please help me to figure out something more original than fruit or teas? I really want to surprise them because they&#x27;ve treated me like their own son.

                              <span>Saw some photos of the Vung Tau giant lobster sculptures, but never managed to pinpoint the location.
 Is anyone familiar with these sculptures? Was it a temporary exhibit? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>good day my fellows, it&#x27;s me again the peasant going to college at 24. 6 months have gone by since i started and it was okay enough. but here comes the problem. as i mentioned in my previous post, this school is unfortunately a good place for shitheads to avoid military service. and i happened to bump into one. this cunt is a fucking retarded coward. that wouldnt be much of a problem if he werent mentally unstable. he faked my facebook account and insulted a few classmates, and fake some classmates&#x27; accounts to insult me( maybe because i refused to let him copy during tests). the insults are pretty heavy. i had thought of just letting an iron bar do the talking since i failed reasoning with him(understandably) but the &quot;mentally unstable&quot; part worries me. what if he always brings a knife, what if he bites me when im off guard,.... those funny thoughts are all over my head. but seriously im an adult now. violence is not a smart choice especially for me who doesnt have time to waste and i dont lower myself to the same level with a shit stirring loser. what do i do now. i doubt the police would handle this. i want to but i cant put up with this shit because i know he wont stop. this douche is persistent.

I&#x27;ve really only heard bad things about English centers like VUS and ILA but not sure if what I&#x27;ve heard is accurate... I also have generally just heard bad things about private tutors - like basically they just want to get paid to drink coffee and chat for an hour. What would you guys recommend as the best place or method to study English in Saigon?

                              <span>As the title says I’m currently looking for friends in my age group. Been here for a month and just been visiting family. I’m planning to live in HCMC and look for a English teaching job soon. I’m fluent in English and Vietnamese (just can’t read or write) I’m open to meeting different people. I can be wholesome and also party(although i have slowed down in my late 20s) I’ve traveled from the south up north 3 years ago so I’m familiar with the landscape. Did the whole backpacking thing already. My interest includes art, tattooing, fishing, motorcycles, tech, music, traveling. I’m pretty open minded just looking for some new friends(usually more extroverted) but just been with family. If you’re chill respectful and have decent morals I’m free to meet up. Have a great day :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been teaching in Vietnam for 4 years, both public schools and centres. I&#x27;ve been in the same place for the entire 4 years, in the country side.
 I&#x27;ve noticed, every year is getting more and more difficult, especially at public schools. I teach at a talent school every day, and I constantly face problems with discipline and respect.
 I&#x27;ve been through students saying &quot;Fuck you, teacher&quot;, students showing me the middle finger, students talking back to me in a disrespectful way and the latest, being called đần. My name is Aidan, so during breaktime, a student decided to write Aiđần on my pencil case while I wasn&#x27;t in the class. 
 These days, I just feel a complete lack of respect from students and Vietnamese teachers. I know foreign teachers get paid a lot more than Vietnamese teachers, …</span>

                              <span>I am traveling to HCMC/Saigon this summer and am from the US. I will be studying and working abroad at an internship. 
 I want to know if it is appropriate to mention, or talk about my interest in engaged buddhism and Thich Nhat Hanhs work in the work place, particularly in education field/working with children? (or just in general)
 Is he a figure that is respected by Vietnamese people? Or will I get judged or looked at differently after mentioning my interest in his books and values? Might it be offensive to mention? I also don’t want to offend anyone!!
 I know this is a very very generalized statement, but it’s something I have been thinking about a lot, especially when learning about Thays history with the Vietnamese government etc.
 Thank you so much in advance!!

 Sad to see they no longer offer original recipe chicken, just crispy chicken and spicy crispy. Flava is ok but I really miss the original recipe chicken. The smell is just so good.

                              <span>Hi everyone! This summer, I&#x27;ll move to Hanoi (from Rome) for a four-year diplomatic posting. I&#x27;m super excited to explore Hanoi and the rest of Vietnam and have a few questions that you can hopefully help me answer.
  
Are there any essentials that are hard to get by in Hanoi? My employer will arrange a moving company, so I have the option of stashing up in Rome before the move. 
 
Where should I live? I am looking for a neighbourhood with a good connection to the Old Quarter for my daily commute (see Q3). I&#x27;m coming alone and would prefer an area with a local vibe that is relatively quiet and clean. My employer pays for my accommodation so fortunately I have a wider choice budget wise. 
 
Is my e-bike enough or should I buy a scooter? I currently own a VanMoof S3 with a top speed of roughly 30 km/h.
 
I have the opportunity of following two weeks of full-time language classes. Can you recommend any schools? A school slightly outside of Hanoi with room and board is possible too. 
 
How to get social? I am no noob to making new friends in new environments, but any tips are very welcome!
 
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>I found Vietnamese businesses like restaurants and coffee shops abroad to be really unfriendly. On several occasions we went inside a Vietnamese restaurant and were completely ignored. So when we finally went on vacation to Vietnam, we were not expecting much in terms of customer service...
 However in Vietnam the customer service turned out to be fantastic! Restaurants and coffee shop workers were really friendly. Hostel owners would treat you like family. Even tiny food stall owners were super kind. Locals would help you order food and give you suggestions. It was really like some kind of Customer Service Fairy Tale
 Then I came back from the vacation, and decided to go to a Vietnamese coffee shop. The cashier didn&#x27;t say anything at all when I ordered.
 I&#x27;m just wondering why there is such a huge discrepancy in customer service between businesses in Vietnam and abroad

I’ve been using Grab for a few weeks now and have only contacted drivers through the app. The Grab app says that it has “number masking” so that my actual number isn’t visible. Thanks

                              <span>Let&#x27;s all take a moment to appreciate the majesty of the Vietnamese spoon. Coming from north America I thought they looked funny.
 But damn can they hold some serious volume and don&#x27;t spill shit everywhere. 
 I&#x27;ve even used it to grind blueberries etc. in a bowl like a mortar and pestle. 
 Amazing. And they stack so nicely!

                              <span>My wife and I run a building supplies center focused on contractors and home builders outside of a major city in Western Canada. After almost a decade of importing goods from China my wife and I have decided to visit your beautiful country in May and reorganize our supply chain into SE Asia due to ideological differences with the PRC. 
 We already have a scheduled visit with RC Group to discuss flooring / tile and would love to hear this subs recommendations for other manufacturers. Our main distributed products are vinyl flooring , plywood, kitchen cabinets , counter tops , kitchen hardware , tile and biomass boiler systems. 
 Really excited to come support your country and work towards moving 100% of our manufacturing to SE Asia.

                              <span>Xin chao ban! I&#x27;m wondering about how some of the Indigenous religious traditions overlap (if at all) as I reconnect with precolonial heritage.
 A lot of the articles I read seem to put more emphasis on Len Dong / spirit mediumship happening in the North but also with a handful of practitioners in diaspora like in California of the US who have been trained or came into the role through heredity (e.g. family has a history of it).
 For Ca Ong/whale worship, a lot of coastal villages including the one part of my family came from still do it, but we&#x27;re disconnected from the culture due to deaths in the family and immigration away from the country. And it seems each village celebrates their festival differently at different moons (TraVinh where some of my relatives were from for example is supposedly on the 3rd lunar month, others do the 6th), and some blend Buddhist traditions with the mourning of a deceased whale, while others remain rooted in Cham culture, and others potentially adopted the Nguyen Dynasty&#x27;s official policies to worship Can Ong but kept their own local practices too.
 So I&#x27;m wondering what the ceremonies and protocols are like, and if the two religions ever overlap, what the ceremonies entail, and what route might be good to inquire further to connect with first.

                              <span>Hello. I’m of Vietnamese ancestry, but was born in the United States, and have lived there all my life. However, I visit Vietnam for holiday periodically, and after hearing my (limited) Vietnamese skills, I’m often asked by locals: “Are you Viet Kieu?”
 It seems like a simple question, but I’ve received different answers from locals, relatives, and the internet. To make it more confusing, the meaning seems to have change from older to younger generations. Can you help?
 Is Viet Kieu: - someone born in Vietnam that now lives overseas - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry who now wishes to live in Vietnam again?
 And more importantly (for me)…does Viet Kieu have a bad connotation for locals?
 Thanks for your help!
 Edit: Added small detail for clarity. And wow, thank you for all the thoughtful responses.

 I look online and tickets are at least 2000$ for June. That is insane. Good news is, there are ways to save money, so what are some ways, thinking outside of the box, to save money?
 -Signing up for credit card bonus (is this true, have any of you done this?) -best day to fly in? -best day to fly out? 
 I fly out of Laguardia or Albany, but if another airport is cheaper, that is close, please let me know. 
 Im full time student, planning to go in June 14th-July 3

 Sometimes the option to &quot;re-route&quot; is blocked by yet another feral dog who came out into the street behind you. 
 I&#x27;ve noticed they have a tendency to follow a person if they try to walk away. And obviously running is stupid beyond all belief. 
 Is there a safe way to pass one of these possibly rabid beasts?

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning on backpacking Vietnam soon and want to do the Ha Giang loop in late April or Early May. I would like advice on if I should it solo or with a small group. I have seen from other posts that some groups from places like Jasmine or QT are sometimes as large as 30 people. To me that doesn&#x27;t sound like a great time, but I would like the social aspect that comes from a group. Does anyone have recommendations for a company that does tours of less than 10? Or anyone that had an experience where they started solo but met people along the way to drive with.

I know they have a different snake compared to the smaller ones and I hope these ones won’t cause problems. Does anyone have any experience bringing these specific ones back to the US?

                              <span>Hi all, I will be traveling to Vietnam soon and wonder if linen clothes is a thing in your country? I see there is a lot of tailored clothes, suits, silk etc., but can&#x27;t find much about linen? I had little time to organise myself and would like to buy shorts, trousers, shirts - in linen, locally.
 Is this a thing in Vietnam?
 EDIT: I wonder what makes you downvote this post, when asking a simple question about your country. please tell me how I offended your personality and made your day bad by asking about clothes for personal use...

                              <span>As a foreigner living in Vietnam, it’s hard to learn about Vietnam religious traditions, despite their ever-present nature (e.g., shrines in stores, schools and homes; temples and pagodas all over the place; lunar calendar holidays; statues; music)
 Are there any YouTube channels, books, or articles—any learning materials—that teach the ignorant (me) about Vietnamese religious traditions?
 My partner and I are raising our child here (2 years old currently), and we want them to be as understanding as possible of the Vietnamese religious traditions. We’d even like to put up a family altar if we can figure out how to do it right.

                              <span>I need to move some of my personal luggage from Vietnam to Europe by ocean freight. Could someone recommend a company that handles such business (preferably HCMC based)?
 I tried to contact some companies found online, but they either required me to fill excessive document works (even asking me how many books I am going to ship) and notarize various IDs, or refused to let me pack myself (I really don&#x27;t want other people touch my stuff, which is also the reason I choose ocean freight, basically no inspection.)
 Thanks for the help!

                              <span>We’ve decided to move to VN. I am VK. Husband and I are in early 40’s. We have a 6 year old. We are planning to send her to international school and since we want to live near her school, it seems as our two options will be D2 or D7. These aren’t the neighborhoods I would pick but we want to live near the school to make commuting less annoying. We are having a hard time deciding between the two and would love any insight! 
 What are the nice apt buildings in D7 in the Phú Mỹ Hưng area? Some of the buildings in D2 had such nice facilities and landscaping and I am struggling to find something comparable in D7. We’d like a building that’s lively, lots of kids.
 What I love about D1, 2, 3 are the cute coffee shops and small stores. And the street food. D7 doesn’t seem to have any of that, right? Just wanna make sure I’m not missing something…
 Not sure if anyone on this subreddit is a parent but would love to know if the families in D2 and D7 are younger families or older and more established with lots of kids?

                              <span>Anyone in Vietnam familiar with any process that a homeowner can go through that pays them to install a cellular tower on their rooftop?
 Background: Family has one of the tallest houses in the neighborhood, so installing a cellular tower would drastically improve reception for the entire neighborhood. Here in the states, mobile providers will pay rent for the privilege. I see many of these cell towers installed in TPHCM, so wondering if that was a &quot;thing&quot; in Vietnam.

                              <span>Any backpacker/traveler who is planning to travel across VN and needs a local as a guide/translator, then I&#x27;m willing to be yours. Since my main purpose in doing this is to practice my English, I won&#x27;t require any charge from you. But I have to make it clear that I&#x27;ll need you to cover all the travel expenses such as food, and accommodation fees on the way for me, because I&#x27;m quite broke now and can&#x27;t afford to pay those. And in return, being a local I have experience about what to avoid while being in the country, as I&#x27;m familiar with the law and many other things here, as well as knowing which places are cheap and safe, which are overpriced, and which services are good and which scams to avoid.
 I don&#x27;t mind traveling by motorbike, for I have one of my own. so feel free to reach out and DM me :) I&#x27;m currently living in Ha Long, a tourist coastal city located 150km to the east of Hanoi. If you are visiting or planning to visit my city, we can also meet and befriend and I will show you around if you&#x27;re interested.

                              <span>My family is buying property just outside of HCMC. This property is so that my in-laws can retire back to Vietnam. We need to send just over 100K USD from the USA. Wiring/bank transfer of the money would be our safest bet I am assuming. If this is the case, will I be able to open a bank account in Vietnam with only a family visa? I am not able to get Vietnam citizenship reinstated. However my wife is, and she is currently waiting on the paper work to be finished. The property will be the in-law’s name. So I am not worried about loosing said property. Next question that I have is once money is in hand, in Vietnam, what is normally done/happens to transfer the title? Is it a red flag if a newly built condo does not have the red book,title? I was told that this is because the condo was recently built and at this time all units are not sold or finished yet. Though I do know that people have been living in that building for ả least 5 years. One would think that my in-laws would be able to answer these questions. But they have been living outside of Vietnam for 40 years. And I have no close relative alive in Vietnam to ask. Please excuse any poor wording or grammatical errors. Writing coherently in is still a struggle.

                              <span>Hey các bạn 😊 im going to Ba Vi for a night but i am feeling quite sick and I should cycle there and back on this weekend. I am already prepared that i can’t cycle back on Sunday. I was thinking is it possible to bring a bicycle on a local bus back to Hanoi? I’ve taken the local bus 71 before also and it got quite full that time. I could also use a taxi but i heard it would cost over 1mil VND and im thinking what would be most convinient way.
 Thank you in advance! 😊

 I really want to buy a record from an online shop in Vietnam and ship it to USA. How can I do this? I tried emailing the shop directly, and they said they can&#x27;t ship to USA. Does anyone here have experience with this?
 Thank you!

                              <span>- Many motorcyclists don&#x27;t wear a helmet, especially during rush hour, and traffic police just ignore them, and they even pass right next to them.
 - Many will turn right or left at the foot of a bridge, even cars. What&#x27;s worse, there are vendors on a freaking bridge!
 - Being on the phone while driving or riding. Worse, texting!
 - Cutting corners is a very common practice. 
 - Double parking, particularly in narrow streets.
 - The most dangerous, I think, is beating the red light, especially without a helmet.
 ​
 I hope the government will have stricter traffic regulations. These situations appear to be everywhere, at least, in where I live.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;ve been creating a playlist on Spotify with music from Southeast Asia, including both traditional and more recently recorded songs. I wanted to kindly ask you for any songs, artists, or records you would recommend me to add to the playlist. 
 I am grateful for any suggestions - except maybe noisy EDM or cheesy mainstream pop! :p It doesn&#x27;t matter from which Southeast Asian nation the music is from, I prefer explore songs that are sung in a native language, though, and not in English - if the music even includes voice recordings. 
 Regarding music which has been released in recent decades, I do particularly enjoy indie rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and post punk, among many other genres.
 When it comes to traditional/older recordings, I appreciate to explore basically everything! &#x3D;) 
 So, many thanks for any recommendations in advance! ;) Here&#x27;s a link to the playlist if someone&#x27;s interested in listening to it, too:

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently bought a few houseplants, such as the one in the photo. I have no idea what kind if plant it is, just that it is not doing so well. The leaves are turning brown and dropping off. 
 I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months, and kept it inside our apartment, watering every few days so that the soil doesn&#x27;t completely dry out. I&#x27;ve moved it outside as I thought it might need more sunlight, but it still is struggling.
 Any tips please? I hav no idea on how to care for plants in tropical climates. Also, what is this plant called?
 Thanks!

                              <span>My home country is the United States, I just finished a teaching contract in Thailand and plan to travel to Vietnam before coming back to Thailand for 2 months (I will extend my visa on arrival 1x). I have proof of my flight back to Thailand, but will I need to buy my ticket from Thailand to the USA to get on my flight to Vietnam? If so can I get a flight that is 2 months after my reentry into Thailand? If not I may need to get a flight where I can adjust the dates later. Let me know your suggestions if this is required. Thank you.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m considering visiting Hanoi and scoping out how accessible it might be for someone in a manual wheelchair who&#x27;d like to avoid driving. I currently live in Yosemite National Park as its only employee in a wheelchair, so I&#x27;m used to standards below what&#x27;s technically legal in U.S. cities, and am used to having difficulty with transportation, groceries, etc. I have some specific questions, but in general I&#x27;d really appreciate some perspective from people with mobility impairments of any kind. Examples of commentary I&#x27;d find very useful:
 Do expats see many disabled people among middle class society?
 Are we treated differently in ways that are negative?
 Would I have a harder time getting or maintaining a job because of a visible disability? (Will I be discriminated against more than I already am in the U.S.?)
 Would it be difficult to find an apartment that&#x27;s more or less accessible without it being considered a luxury or additional spending requirement?

                              <span>Long story short, I&#x27;m going to HCMC and will be meeting my Vietnamese girlfriend (who lives with her parents).
 I&#x27;d like to stay near District 1 but it&#x27;s my understanding most hotels won&#x27;t let her visit by law because we&#x27;re not married. She says it&#x27;s probably fine and she can talk to the desk and tell them she&#x27;s actually my GF to smooth it over but won&#x27;t research ahead of time for me which is frustrating since she&#x27;s so confident this will work anywhere (internet tells me otherwise).
 I found some sites listing &quot;girl friendly&quot; hotels, but they all look pretty dumpy (what you&#x27;d expect for that crowd).
 Does anyone know any decent 4-star or so hotels in District 1 that would allow her? I&#x27;ve started to email some places in the meantime. Budget is around $75-150USD/night which should be plenty. I&#x27;d like to not stay in a rundown brothel which many of the places that allow guests seem to resemble.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was in Vietnam for the first couple weeks of March and have been back in the U.S. for a little over a week now. I cannot stop thinking about my time there, and can&#x27;t seem to shake the feeling that I wish I was back. I was hoping this feeling would have subsided by now.
 My question is, for those of you who have been through this before,
 what do??

                              <span>Mom is visiting her family and will be arriving there tomorrow, an emergency came up with her relative and they&#x27;re no longer able to pick her up. She has to go from Da Nang to Hue, looked on Da Nang&#x27;s airport site for recommendations, does anyone here have any others? I saw Grab mentioned, but she barely knows how to use her smartphone, so that may be out. She also has quite a bit of luggage and two other individuals coming along ,so a large van will be needed. Is there anything I could do on my end (U.S.) to book something? Or just give her one of these numbers? Thank you.

                              <span>Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but this is the direct experience I&#x27;ve had whilst living in Hanoi for the last 4 months. I have my local vinmart, and another vinmart down the road and a circle k. I have to say, my experience of customer service has been the worst I have ever experienced. At the one store, the same girl (in her late 20&#x27;s), just looks at me and has this look of contempt, of anger almost, grabs my items, scans them then points to the screen in a really &#x27;I can&#x27;t be bothered, hurry up&#x27; way. She grabs my card scans it, prints the receipt and just hands it to me, not even a smile, a nod, a goodbye, no eye contact. The other day she takes the basket and just throws it on the floor. Then again, tonight, the other store, I go in, the young man didn&#x27;t say one word to me the entire time. No hello, no thank you, no goodbye (in Vietnamese.. I don&#x27;t expect English)... And just slammed the receipt on the table and continued chatting. My question is, are these people taught by their companies to observe any form of customer service? Is it because they are shy? (even though they stare at me and even once sighed at me for taking too long to use my phone app to pay even though their card machine wasn&#x27;t working)? Is it because they have no idea what to say to foreigners? Because I&#x27;ve been to other countries and a simple head nod, or even small gesture to acknowledge the customer and make him or her feel welcome isn&#x27;t so difficult is it? Now I rather hate going shopping now. It is not an enjoyable situation and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has the same experience in Hanoi. As a customer spending money in these stores I feel entitled to some form of customer service. I dont expect much, but a simple xin Chào, cam on or even a smile to the foreigners who are living and working hard here (or even tourists spending their money here) isn&#x27;t so difficult... Or is it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m aware that the internet is sometimes bad here. But is there any place/site to check if others complaining? So I would not feel alone &#x3D;)
 Or if it is just on my end - then it is time to fix some routers.

                              <span>I am staying in Ha Long Bay for a few nights, and will be back in Hanoi on friday before flying out. I am wondering where I can get a pith helmet for a good price/quality? I see many locals wearing them around here and I think they look awesome!
 I am referring to something like this:

 I also would like to know if I would appear as a silly farang for wearing one of these? Would it come off more costumey or just as a cool hat I got on vacation?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I was a in Hanoi. Just a regular massage, nothing special or &quot;happy ending&quot;. Ticket was 300K VND for 1.5 hour. I gave the receptionist (who handles the tip for the massage person) 50K VND. She said that&#x27;s too little, usually the tip is 150K, 200K or even 300K. Is this true for a regular massage? Whatever happened to tipping 10% of the bill? Why do I have to 50% to 100% of the bill?

I have been recently Thailand and Taiwan and at both places it was mainly cash, card use was super limited and withdrawing cash was very expensive. I was kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t take more Euros/Pounds with me. How are the ATM fees in Vietnam and how common is it to pay with cards?

                              <span>Met a guy in his late 40’s from Vietnam this weekend and I’m trying to figure out how to spell his name. Over the phone I had no idea I wasn’t speaking to an American and heard Jim and didn’t think anything of it. When we met in person I realized he was of Asian descent and when I heard him say his name I realized it wasn’t Jim. 
 The best I could describe his name would be how the English word “You” would sound with an “M” at the end, Youm. He said it’s pretty common for people mistake it for Jim. But I’m having trouble figuring out how his name is actually spelled. 
 I’m hoping this is a common enough name that I could easily get an answer here. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Last time I brought the green &quot;Muối Ớt Chanh Nha Trang&quot; but it didn&#x27;t work so well. Please suggest the best ones I should bring this time.
  
Mắm tôm and similar should not be an option because I need to make sure I can check it on the airplane.
 
We usually use it to dip BBQ meats. Usually venison during hunting season or beef or pork ribs.
 
Great if I can order it online. I don&#x27;t live in HCMC but occasionally get there for a day or two.
 
 As for myself, what do you suggest for a very hot/spicy sauce? For me even the Cholimex &quot;tương ớt cay nồng&quot; is not very spicy though it&#x27;s almost there.

                              <span>What energy drink has the most caffeine that is widely available in Vietnam? Red Bull, at least in the United States, doesn&#x27;t have that much caffeine. I am looking for the most &quot;bang for my buck.&quot;
 In the US there is a drink called BANG that has 300 mg of caffeine plus guarana, vitamin B, etc. Is there anything like this in Vietnam?

 I just accepted a job offer and will be moving to Nha Trang soon. 
 Are there any insights, tips, fun secret places, ect that you can think of to share with me as I prepare to move? 
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of research, but I&#x27;ve found nothing beats anecdotal experience. 
 Much obliged!

                              <span>Hi friends,
 I am interested in moving to Vietnam and working for a year. I have quite sensitive health problems, blepharitis and quite serious eczema; right now I have them both fairly under control but am quite concerned that the pollution will cause it to flair.
 Ideally, I want to move to Hanoi, but am also considering Saigon as I heard it&#x27;s better air .I fear the air might affect my health problems. I would happily buy an air filter, mask, and try my best to avoid rush hour.
 Am I worrying too much? Is a year short enough to be relatively safe?
 What are your experiences, thank you!

                              <span>Trying to keep it general lest it gets flagged as advertising. I usually get very few matches (well under ten, and then mostly single moms or scammers). My guess is since my looks are very average, plus I&#x27;m on the extremely skinny side of things. Trying to figure out if it would be worthwhile to invest some money. What difference have the following made for you?
  
Paid account
 Having professional photos taken
 Anything else?
  
I&#x27;m in HCMC (and limit my search to there) if that makes any difference.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am heading to vietnam for 2 weeks of “backpacking” travel. All of my accommodations have been paid for already, I was just wondering how much cash I should take out for food basically and some souvineers. I keep seeing mixed numbers. I plan to do Ha Long Bay day tour and probably a few others. My travel style is usually budget travel and I rarely drink alcohol. If anyone can give me a ball park number it would be greatly appreciated!

The bus was just shaky, the bus driver drove like a maniac, honking all the time, slammed on the breaks a lot and sending me flying off my seat a few times. I eventually ended up getting a headache, dizziness and just couldn’t sleep without worrying that this bus was gonna crash or something.

I have been here for about two and a half weeks - and we have not been off to the best start. Due to several factors, it&#x27;s looking very likely that my work permit and TRC will not finish in time. To top it off, it could cost me my job.
 I got a US FBI background check before coming, but unfortunately was informed on my second day in the country that it is invalid for Vietnam and I need to get a local check. I was informed there are two ways to go about this - apply for a residence certificate from the police and apply for the criminal check in person with that residence certificate, or do it all online via a private agency.

Even though both my parents, both my sisters (33F, 21F), and I have visited Hanoi several times, most of my mother&#x27;s side has never visited North Vietnam yet (north of 17th parallel), despite the fact most of her relatives still live in Vietnam (from what I have heard from my mother, her side is quite wealthy and many of her relatives are business owners). Many of them only went around the Southern third of Vietnam and the furthest North many of them has visited is Nha Trang/Dalat. In fact, for all of my mother&#x27;s relatives in the US (most came during the mid-late 1990s), none of them went above Nha Trang and half of them only visited Vietnam once or twice afterwards.
 Despite the fact I have only lived in Vietnam for 5 years before moving to Russia to study in 2006 and subsequently moving to the US at 11 in 2012, I have visited Vietnam several times afterwards (my most recent trip was in 2019 by the way), and I have visited the following places:
 Ca Mau, Can Tho, Long Xuyen, Ben Tre, Vung Tau, HCMC, Tay Ninh, Phan Thiet, Dalat, Nha Trang, Buon Ma Thuot, Tuy Hoa, Quy Nhon, Pleiku, Quang Ngai, Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Vinh, Thanh Hoa, Nam Dinh, Hanoi, Hai Duong, Haiphong, Ha Long, Thai Nguyen, Sapa
 ​
  
I am curious if it is common for Vietnamese people to have never visited the Northern half (North of 16/17 parallel)
 Plus, how common is it for Vietnamese Americans to never return to Vietnam or only return there once since moving to the US

                              <span>The plugs, electrical outlets, power strips etc. Why are they so hard to plug anything in?? Every time I try to plug in a lamp, charger, appliance it&#x27;s a battle of strength. Am I dumb? (Very possible) Is there a trick to it? (God I hope so) Two prong, three prong, doesn&#x27;t matter. I feel like I am going to break something every time! I even bought new power strips and it&#x27;s the same thing.

                              <span>Hi, I live abroad and would like to create a basic bank account in Vietnam so that I can buy stuff when I&#x27;m visiting. Just a free account with a debit card and a reliable mobile app. Can anyone recommend a good bank and product please?
 I want to buy train tickets (e.g. Ha Noi to Hai Duong) and someone told me that I should buy them in a bank mobile app. Do all banks have this feature?
 Last question, when Vietnamese people go to the shops and they &quot;chuyển khoản&quot;, do they mean paying with a card or is that some other way of paying that I don&#x27;t know?
 Thanks!

 Is it worth it even in the rain?

                              <span>We are a family of two adults and two tweens. We will be in North Vietnam for a week first week of June. Plan to be in Hanoi and Ninh Binh. On the fence about Ha Long Bay. The thought of it is exciting, and seems like a bucket list thing, but not sure if a 1 night cruise will be enjoyable if the bay is overcrowded. 
 Are there 5 star cruises there that take a less crowded route?
 We don&#x27;t care so much about spending the night on the boat but seems like that is the standard way to enjoy it.
 I hear there are other bays nearby but that they are not any less crowded.
 Tips?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m thinking about doing some tours for my next visit and wanted to know what everyone&#x27;s experiences were. Where are your must-go to places? I&#x27;m thinking about possibly staying for about 5 weeks and want to feel like I truly get to explore. I&#x27;m open to extending the trip if it&#x27;s worthwhile.

                              <span>Xin chào!
 I am visiting Hanoi from now until friday, the 31st of april, and I am interested in getting a custom tailored mens suit! I just want a jacket and pants, but if the price is good I could be convinced to get a shirt and/or vest too. I am thinking of choosing a charcoal wool/wool blend material.
 I am in my mid-20s but want it to be a versatile suit, so nothing either super vintage nor super modern; Regular length and medium-width notched lapels for the jacket and a slim-straight cut for the pants would be ideal. I also would like the suit to have some stretch, as I often get uncomfortable with the restrictive/stiff feel of store-bought suits.
 My budget would ideally be 5million VND, but a lot of talk online about this stuff is from pre-covid times, so I don&#x27;t know if that is a realistic number. Please correct my expectations if they are unrealistic.
 What tailors would be appropriate for what I am looking for, and what prices can I expect? Also: do I need to buy the fabric separately on my own, or will that be included in the tailor bill? Or would it be cheaper to buy on my own? 
 Any and all advice is much appreciated! Cảm ơn : )

                              <span>Hi everyone, I’m taking a trip to Vietnam soon and trying to workout my itinerary and would love some advice!
 So on the 4th of May, the plan is to take the night train from Dong Hoi up to Tam Coc. I’ve realised maybe 1 day is not enough for Tam Coc. Plus it’s a long journey from Tam Coc up to Ha Giang…
 After Tam Coc, the plan was to do the Ha Giang loop, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, however if we stay the extra day in Tam Coc, plus the long journey, I’m not sure we will have 4 days to do the loop. 
 We have to be in Hai Phong Bay at 11:30am on Monday 10th for a trip to Cat Ba.
 So here is my question:
 Should we skip Tam Coc all together, get up to Ha Giang and just do the loop for as long as we can? Should we do the 2 days in Tam Coc and just do a smaller loop of Ha Giang? Should I stick to 1 day in Tam Coc and the 4 day loop of Ha Giang?
 It looks like if we decide to go to Tam Coc, we will have to get a night bus up to Ha Giang. And of course then another night bus from Ha Giang down to Hanoi. Lot of night travel - is it too much? Should we ease up and save stuff for another visit?
 Thanks for your help!

My question is, how do I convert it to VND for the best price? I heard that there are a few ATMS in Saigon, but they have high fees. Are there any exchange that I can use to convert Bitcoin into VND?

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;ve been saving up for a trip for a very long time and I have my heart set on going to Vietnam. I&#x27;m 21F, Indian, and have a BA degree in History and am currently in my last year of law school. I have been seriously contemplating the idea of enrolling in a CELTA course and English as a foreign language full time, but this particular trip is going to have to be limited to 1 month. 
 I am looking at volunteering to to teach English or working with children in any capacity. I understand that my lack of certification and the duration of the trip is going to be an issue but I would be happy to be involved in any sort of volunteer work. I have previously worked as a college counselor for underprivileged children and been a paid tutor at an IELTS center in my city. 
 I have managed to find a few workaway opportunities that help you assist English language teachers and work on curriculum development but I&#x27;m not sure how legit they are. Please help connect me to any volunteer opportunities in the month of June.

                              <span>Hi! I have been riding motorbikes and scooters in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia without issues. Just arrived in Vietnam, rented a scooter in Mui Ne and within the first 15 minuntes I was taken to the police station. Tried to haggle the fine but in the end I left with 500k less in my pocket. 
 Given that I am not going to be able to produce a valid licence since Im already here and my IDP has only a B stamp: Are there any tricks to avoid being stopped or prevent the fine at all? I&#x27;m going to be renting bikes in Dalat, Da Nang, Nihn Binh and Ha Giang, so would rather not pay 500k each time.
 If not able to avoid police encounters, what would the minimum reasonable &quot;fine&quot; that I could settle for?

 Should I go for bigger store like Phong Vu, Nguyen Kim or try smaller store like Tin Hoc Ngoi Sao, Gear.vn. 
 Still trying to adjust to my new life here in Vietnam. Thank you all
 Edit: sorry I forgot to mention. I’m living in HCM now so any place in HCM is highly appreciated

 So I wanted to ask if anyone had alternative motorbiking suggestions in north Vietnam? Theres a 5 day window in our itinerary between stops at Sapa and Ha Long Bay, so any suggestions of beginner friendly routes lasting 2-5 days would be awesome!

                              <span>Hello everyone, my wife and I will be staying in phu Quoc for the next few days and are near the Ong Lang beach. We’re doing a relatively budget holiday so staying in a cheapesh place half an hour walk away from the beach.
 Most of the other discussion I see mention resorts for beaches but are the public beaches here good? My wife suffers a bit from too much sun so we wouldn’t mind having umbrellas and facilities at the beaches! 
 We will also spend a couple of days towards the south west of the island if anyone jas recommendations?
 Thanks a lot in advace!

                              <span>Hey fellow Vietnamese! I spent a wonderful 10 day trip in Hanoi a month ago. I loved it and I want to be back for another remote working period, maybe in Da Nang. My only concern is the internet speed, as my job relies heavily on Zoom meetings. Last time the connection was bumpy, I had some serious issues one day and I am concerned. I read the news and know about internet cables, but I prefer first hand information. So here I am, any feedback will be much appreciated. Thanks a lot!

                              <span>I’m travelling from Hội An to Hue and was hoping to travel along the Hai Van Pass.
 Is there a way I can rent a motor bike in Hội An or Da Nang and return somewhere in Hue? I won’t have the time to return it back to the original place. 
 Otherwise, would you recommend an alternative mode of transportation (like a bus) where I’d be able to stop and check out the view? 
 For additional context - I’m a budget travel so kinda looking for an affordable way to travel. Also, I’m an exercised driver in Canada but motorbikes are new for me so I’m not sure if this is a beginner friendly route.

                              <span>Hi everyone! This is directed at people who have traveled/are from Vietnam. 
 So I&#x27;m going to Ha Long Bay with my university and as part of one of the classes were doing a project (mini doc) about community perception of UNESCO world heritage sites and was wondering if anyone knew what the laws around filming in that area are. I wasn&#x27;t able to find much information other than for large film crews and as this is a school project where I and another classmate would be interviewing 2-3 locals I don&#x27;t believe we fall into that category. The setup would be minimal with a tripod, camera, mic, and potentially a very small light if needed. Any help or pointers would be appreciated!

                              <span>Xin chào everybody. My friend and I are in Hanoi and after a long trip on the train to get here we’ve been very thirsty. 
 We went to Beer Junction last night thinking we could hydrate with Bia Hoi but no one had heard of it!
 We asked around and looked online but there seems to be no sign of fresh keg beer. Don’t worry, we were able to hydrate with a few tasty green Saigon’s but today our pilgrimage continues. 
 Can anyone help? Does Bia Hoi still exist? 
 Thanks a lot 🍻

 Does this thing sting and is it aggressive? I&#x27;ve seen a few of them recently.

                              <span>So I just came across a post in this sub asking about their experience being a Vietnamese. I and the OP don&#x27;t have similar upbringings, so I don&#x27;t, and won&#x27;t, judge or say how they should feel.
 However, the comment section was flooded with people saying &quot;Vietnamese people are so money-focused, materialistic, etc etc&quot;, in a quite derisive way. And not just in that post either, I&#x27;ve seen such comments on multiple occasions, and they pretty much annoyed me.
 Yes, I admit, a lot of Vietnamese people are materialistic. But do you know why they are that way?

                              <span>Hi! 
 My girlfriend and I will be setting off on a 7 week trip in 2 weeks to South east Asia, including 3 weeks in Vietnam! Around week 5, we are hoping to take a 5 day trip round the Ha giang loop, and I wanted to discuss the logistics of this here. A few notes:
  
neither of us have ridden a motorcycle/moped before, but are confident car drivers. We have access to a 100cc motorbike for practice
 both of our UK drivers licences cover &quot;AM&quot; vehicles (motorbikes smaller than 50cc) but to ride up to 175cc, we need an A1 licence
 we plan to rent motorbikes in the islands of Thailand earlier in our trip, and gauge whether we think it is feasible to carry out 5 days of driving.
 We will be doing the Ha Giang Loop in early May
  
I guess my biggest question is what are our options?
 Should we try to get an A1 licence before we go? (It only takes a day AFAIK so we should be able to sort it before the trip) if we bother doing this, will we be able to get an IDP that works? I&#x27;ve heard conflicting reports regarding the state of IDPs
 Should we go as we are? In this case we&#x27;ll need to pay off police I&#x27;m sure which isn&#x27;t a huge deal but I&#x27;d be worried about getting our bikes impounded, especially half way through the loop
 Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>We will be visiting Bach Ma National Park in April and information is a little difficult to find. We initially thought we would do the five lakes trail, but since our daughter is only nine and, to be frank, rather short for her age, we don&#x27;t feel comfortable with the climbing part, as we are not sure she will be able to reach for the ropes. There are, supposedly, two trails to reach five lakes - do you also have to climb when you take the easier one (that is, not the adventure trail)? And has anyone done the peasant trail? I have not been able to find any information on this trail, except that it ends in a water fall and has the best likelyhood to see birds (which would actually be super nice). Does this trail involve any climbing, too?

                              <span>I&#x27;m Muppi, I&#x27;m 25 years old, a photographer, and a filmmaker from the beautiful Lakshadweep Islands in India. I create cinematic content for businesses to use on their social media platform. I have 6 years of experience in social media content curation. My passion for filmmaking has taken me to many places. I have been traveling and volunteering around India, which has been a fulfilling experience. 
 Where I grew up very connected to the sea, I grew up on the island life fixing boats, painting them and a lot of community works as apart of the local lifestyle there, as someone who loves nature and sustainability, I&#x27;m excited to travel outside of my country for the first time to put my skills to work for a meaningful cause. I&#x27;m passionate about balancing sports like slacklining, skateboarding, and surfing. I&#x27;ve spent a good amount of time sharing and teaching these skills. I&#x27;m also a documentary filmmaker and love to capture the beauty of nature and the stories of people who live in harmony with the environment.
 Few volunteering opportunities I did : - Helped a farmer for 3 months on his produce somewhere in the lush hills of western ghats in India. - Volunteered for an eco-festival in India to teach skating and help the festival crew. - Volunteered in the himalayas to help build a home-stay with a sustainable lifestyle. - Helped a few homestays and small businesses to provide quality content for their social media.
 Let&#x27;s work together to make a positive impact while exploring a new culture!

                              <span>Inspired by a comment thread in a recent post, I started to curiously think about the ideological/political alignment of Vietnamese people (or, at least the users of this subreddit): how do you perceive yourself ideologically, disregarding one&#x27;s support for the government - or lack thereof - as a political position itself?
 Do you appreciate traditional family values, free trade, private property rights, low taxation, strong military, social hierarchies, minimum social spending; are you into trade unions, social egalitarianism, progressive taxation, governmental support programs, free health care and education, gender equality? 
 Do you get thrilled by socializing the means of production, class consciousness, centralized planning, international proletarian revolution and anti-imperialism; or are you proudly &quot;anti-woke&quot;, support the interests of Vietnamese people over everything else, think that LGBTQ+ people should just go back to the closet and believe that climate change is a globalist hoax? Answer below!

                              <span>Hi there, everyone!
 I am docked at the cargo terminal just outside Ho Chi Minh for the next few days, and I&#x27;d like to get to see some of the city, despite my hellish work schedule. For that, I have some questions:
  
Will I be finding much open outside after 11pm?
 Is it realistic to try to use Grab to have someone pick me up? The app as of now gives me an estimate of 19-20min for someone to even show up, and I know the drive to Ho Chi Minh is like 45min-1h.
 Does anyone know a taxi driver who I can contact to perhaps strike a deal to bring crew members in and out for the next couple of days?
  
My company organizes a shuttle bus but it runs only until 8-9pm and I usually leave work at 10pm. I only have USD, and cards. No local currency at the moment. As per Vietnamese authorities, I am also not authorized to wander about anywhere other than Ho Chi Minh, and just a night pass cost me 10 USD, otherwise I&#x27;d have 10pm curfew.
 Please help!

 Background info: I ordered a package from the UK, it arrived into VNSGNA but got no updates for 4 working days. So I contacted VNpost and this is their response.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Vietnamese-American, and I feel as though I haven&#x27;t developed a really positive relationship with being Viet. But, I would like to relate better to my background.
 For me, I associate the Vietnamese language and Vietnamese life with a lot of negativity. I think of Vietnamese people that are just really focused on money, friends who have issues with their parents, adults that are constantly yelling with each other, and people who just take out their insecurities on others because they want respect or validation,
 I haven&#x27;t been able to have a lot of positive interactions and associations when it comes to being Viet. Viet life is just viewed as a source of turmoil to me sometimes.
 If you also feel this way about being Viet, please comment your emotions below.
 I know some people who have a good and healthy relationship to being Viet, but I&#x27;d consider them to be few. I&#x27;d really like to have a better relationship to being Viet, because I feel like a lot of us hate ourselves. Historically, it looks like a lot of us have just wanted to attach ourselves to other larger empires, such as China, France, or America. And, that makes me kinda sad. 
 The few people that I know that have a positive relationship to being Vietnamese come from good, healthy families. But, our community has a lot of trauma, and, to me, that makes those good families become uncommon.

                              <span>Having been on this sub for a month or so now, I’m realized that a lot of you are either really angry or just generally standoffish. I joined this sub to be able to live vicariously through everyone else traveling while I am not in VN and what I’ve experienced so far is a bunch of nasty people giving travelers shit for not giving every single detail about any given trip or cultural question. If I hadn’t already been to Vietnam and found out that the people there are, by and large, much more friendly and welcoming, this sub would 100% put me off from traveling there.
 (Of course, judging by some of the comments I’ve seen, a lot of you isolationists would be fine with it.)

                              <span>Hello all. I will be traveling to Vietnam for a business trip and the area I will be in does not have many English speaking people I’ve been told. I am wondering what social cues or cultural customs should I be aware of while there.

 I am visiting Hanoi for my first time very soon. I want to bring back jade jewelry for my mom, but I don’t speak Vietnamese fluently anymore. I am Vietnamese but lost the language growing up in the US. Is there any good jade jewelry stores that can accommodate in English?

Is it the case that I haven&#x27;t met enough Vietnamese people, or is it that the name just isn&#x27;t very popular anymore? 
 On a related topic, are there any names that have completely fallen out of favour because an infamous person held that name?

                              <span>We are traveling through Vietnam in April and will be on Phu Quoc for a few days towards the end of our trip. To compensate our daughter a bit for all the walking and looking at things, we had considered visiting the Aquatopia water park. As we know by now, the free shuttle bus has been discontinued, but we found out that the public bus #11 (which also runs from the airport) goes close enough to the cable car station. Only unfortunately it seems that the bus is also no longer running, at least I can&#x27;t find any information about it on the net (not even on the airport page). Has anyone ridden the bus lately or knows that it no longer exists? If it runs, we would look for a hotel along the bus line, otherwise we go, as actually planned, to Ong Lang and forget the thing with the park simply (I have no desire to pay 60€ for cabs to Cable Station and back, then we rather invest the money in as much ice cream as she can eat...). Or are there any other public busses, preferably from/to the Ong Lang area?

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m interested in buying some books and mangas from Vietnam, only issue doesn&#x27;t seem to be online the possibility for international western buyers (I&#x27;m from europe) to buy from Vietnam.
 So here I am, I&#x27;m looking for someone who&#x27;s interested in assisting me on a monthly basis, under a fee of course to buy, stock and then ship these mangas for me.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on a culinary journey lately, exploring the delicious world of Vietnamese breakfasts. We all know and love Pho and Banh Mi, but there&#x27;s so much more to the Vietnamese breakfast scene that often goes unnoticed. Recently, I&#x27;ve discovered a lesser-known but absolutely mouthwatering dish: Banh Cuon Cao Bang! 😋
 For those who haven&#x27;t tried it yet, Banh Cuon Cao Bang is a delicate and savory rice noodle roll filled with minced pork, wood ear mushrooms, and shallots. It&#x27;s usually served with a side of fresh herbs, cucumber, and a tasty dipping sauce. It has quickly become my go-to breakfast choice, and I&#x27;m eager to find more dishes like this!
 So, fellow foodies, I&#x27;m asking you: What are your favorite Vietnamese breakfasts, particularly the lesser-known ones? Let&#x27;s uncover some hidden culinary gems together and share our love for Vietnamese cuisine. Please share your favorites and any stories or memories you have associated with them. If you have any secret spots or recipes, feel free to share as well!
 Looking forward to reading your responses and expanding my breakfast horizons! 🍽️
 Cheers and happy eating! 🥢

It was my belief that stimulants are banned in your country. Can I get ADHD meds in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hi r/Vietnam!
 I&#x27;m currently looking into getting the best out of my Phin filter as I recently got a decent hand grinder. People over at r/coffee tend to be pour-over and aeropress guys so I don&#x27;t read much about other brewing methods there. That&#x27;s why I decided to ask here. :)
 Any tips on getting the best brew? I personally haven&#x27;t tweaked much from what I usually do these past months when I first had a phin: Grind 14g of beans using setting 3 (medium fine) for my 6 click cheapo grinder that I bought over at Shopee, preheat the brewer and the glass, dump the grounds on the brewing chamber and shake to level, drop the press filter and press a bit (this one I&#x27;m not sure if necessary), pour hot-off-the-boil water about twice the volume of the coffee into the chamber to bloom the grounds and wait for 30 seconds, pour water to the brim of the chamber, then cover to retain the heat. Drip finishes at around 6 mins.
 I usually make coffee via pour-over and I love the different nuances in the process and how each factor affects the output of the brew, But I love the simplicity of the Phin and how no non-sense it is -it&#x27;s brute force coffee.
 Also, what should I look for if I want to buy a better Phin filter? And if you are a Timemore C2 user, what is your current grind setting?
 I would love to hear from you guys. :) Thanks!

 We are a group of students conducting a research project on circular economy (in electronics and fashion industry) and we would be grateful if you could take a few minutes to participate in our survey project.

 Only Cambodia, Vietnam, Brunei and East Timor starved their national teams in March.
 But hey, Cambodia is no superpower. Brunei is ASEAN&#x27;s minnow. East Timor also a minnow. People will not blame them if they didn&#x27;t schedule.
 But Vietnam? The nation that reached the final round of FIFA World Cup qualification and yet the national team is left starved with domestic league suspended for a month to serve the U-20 and U-23. For what? Professional countries will not interrupt domestic leagues for youth tournaments, only Vietnam does.
 Who is responsible for this? Who deliberately starved the national team?
 Shameful.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ll be in Ninh Binh next week and it&#x27;s calling for a lot of rain. I was hoping to do a good amount of treking and sightseeing but will all the rain keep me inside? Should I just stay in Hanoi and enjoy the city life? I have a torn ACL so I&#x27;m hesitant to be out in the rain incase I slip. 
 Let me know what you guys think.
 ​
 Cam on!

 What is the easiest route? Digital nomad? Business Visa? Marriage? Apply for duel citizenship? Move to another country together?

 If it were you, would you rather spend more time in Hanoi, Cat Ba, or Tam Coc? Looking for any and all insight!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m visiting Vietnam next month with my partner and our five month and am trying to finalise our plans.
 We fly out of HCMC so we&#x27;re planning on Da Lat being the last place we visit and then getting bus to HCMC the night before our flight (we&#x27;ve both visited HCMC before so don&#x27;t feel the need to go again).
 Just trying to figure out how many days to spend in Da Lat, i.e. should we do 2 nights, three days or one night, two days bearing in mind we have a small child with us so will probably be sticking to Da Lat rather than going on any trips in the nearby area. 
 What do people think?

                              <span>Hi ,I have been to Vietnam four times , love the place . The food( along with many other things)is spectacular .I have been trying to bake Banh Mi at home . I&#x27;ve had medium success but miles away from a proper Vietnamese Bahn Mi. Is there a Vietnamese baker out there somewhere who would share the recipe. I&#x27;m really confused - some recipes use egg ,milk ,vitamin c powder . What is the correct recipe ?

                              <span>Hi! I (30F) will be solo travelling through Vietnam in April and I am hoping to do a Ha Giang Loop motorbike tour. I am struggling to find good recommendations. Here are my requirements:
 - Easy rider who drives safe and is friendly
 - Small group tour (max 8 people)
 - Staying in authentic homestays 
 - Off the beaten path/away from other tourists as much as possible (acknowledging that I am a tourist myself)
 - 4 days/3 nights would be ideal but open to slightly longer
 Also, I will be coming from Sa Pa, so any advice about transport between Sa Pa and Ha Giang is welcome. Thanks so much!

 Has that hit Vietnam yet? If I got him a record player, could he buy records to use? Anything else a young 20something kid who likes music and photography would want from the states?

                              <span>I’ve been shopping at the same liquor store for about a year now and have developed a very kind relationship with the elderly Vietnamese couple that own the place. It’s limited to just my time in the store throughout the week, but I’ve always loved Vietnamese culture so I’ve gotten to know them and their story better lately. I’ve also recently started learning the most very basics of Vietnamese. Would it be rude to maybe greet them in their native language once I’ve got enough practice?

                              <span>Hi, my gf and i are looking at apartments to move out but we are not 100% sure about the process. We&#x27;d love to know how we can avoid scams or getting ripped off as well as step by step process after we have chosen an apartment. What are the signs that we are being scammed? We are not going thru an agent since i was told they charge exorbitant prices. I was also told not to pay deposit without a deposit paper, renting contract and at least have a look at the apartment.

                              <span>Getting married to a Vietnamese lady. We are both 30 this year. I am curious about the whole marriage age superstition thing. We wanted to get married next year but we will be 33* (Vietnamese age plus 1 year for Tet) which is a no go according to her mum. I think we then said let’s do it this year but that was also bad and realistically my family couldn’t make it to Vietnam this year. However, we didn’t want to wait until 2025. So after some consultation with a pháp sư her mum said this year was ok and we will have ancestor welcoming (me?) into the family this year on the day of our legal marriage abroad and the wedding ceremony in Vietnam next year, but since it’s unlucky we are just having a “party” not a wedding ceremony. I just found the whole thing kinda confusing. Is this normal across Vietnam?

                              <span>I (18f) am trying to find ways to develop a relationship with my boyfriend’s (20m) parents. We’ve only been dating a couple months, but I’ve already met his parents, and while they are very kind to me, I haven’t had a full real conversation with them. It’s always in passing that we exchange words. I’m white and don’t know much about Vietnamese culture or customs, so I’m not sure exactly how to approach them for fear of accidentally coming off as rude or ignorant. I love my boyfriend a lot, and I go to his house and see them pretty often. He doesn’t have a very close relationship with his family, and even they don’t talk much outside of them asking if he’s eaten or where he is, so I’m not sure if he’d be able to help me here. It means a lot to me, having them like me, as I see us having a long future together. Does anyone have any tips or things I should know/necessary knowledge like what is or is not respectful? Or gift ideas to thank them for letting me stay at their house? Anything would be great. Thank you!

                              <span>hello good people of Vietnam. I fell in love with Saigon when I visited earlier this month, so much so that I am returning for a month early April.
 Aside from bars, coffee shops and language clubs, which I will definitely be making use of this time around, was wondering if anybody had any pointers for a 20-something to make friends in the area
 thank you 🙂

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to Hanoi for 5 days and HCMC for 5 days and I&#x27;d really appreciate knowing someone there who&#x27;d be willing to give me some opinions on places to go and things to do. 
 I&#x27;d like to meet a fellow redditor over some drinks and food and hopefully make a new friend during my trip if you&#x27;re comfortable with that as well. 
 If not, I&#x27;d still appreciate the advice 🙂
 EDIT: As an introvert, it&#x27;s a lot harder for me to make new friends and approach random people and start a conversation which is why I made the post.

                              <span>The Chams, if I remember right, with the fall of Champa, were separated into three groups practising different religions. The Central Chams have largely retained their Hindu belief, although this is practised under a form called &quot;Ba La Mon&quot;. The Southern Chams in the Mekong Delta have largely adhered to Sunni Islam and they are the only ethnic group in Vietnam to be Muslims.
 The third Cham group, however, practise a complex religion called &quot;Bani&quot;. It was thought to be traced from Persian traders (Persia/Iran was converted to Shia Islam by Shah Ismail I), who spread their Shia Islam to the community during the Vietnamese shogunates (Trinh-Nguyen). However, Bani is unique that it is so synchronised with other religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and even Han and Kinh (Vietnamese) people&#x27;s folk traditions that it lost most of the original Islamic belief.
 The Bani community is small today but their religious practise has ignited discussions. Some groups believed that they are actually Muslims but with a different characteristic. But some other (including many Banis) disagree with the classification of Bani as a separate Shia Islam sect and instead insist that they are Banis and not Muslims. There is a 2006 documentary called &quot;A Strange Islam&quot; by Agnes De Feo about this community, which put their existence to spotlight.
 Question here is, are Bani people Shia Muslims or just Banis? And what kind of religion Bani is?

                              <span>Hey!
 Warning: tourist question. I&#x27;m heading to Vietnam and gonna stay for a month at a time. I&#x27;m looking for somewhere I can find reasonably priced 1-month rentals in a big city. I&#x27;ve used Airbnb before but it&#x27;s overpriced usually. 
 Anyone got any ideas, websites or groups I can check out? I have some vietnamese friends that can help me with interpreting if there are some good local alternatives. 
 Thanks!

This brand is very new here. I want to know if what they are saying is true and how&#x27;s the performance of vicem, would you really recommend it? Thanks

                              <span>Just some background information, I have 6 years of experience teaching and I was in Vietnam in 2017 for a year.
 Is it still the case that one can find a job in the country easily? 
 Uk citizen with all the relevant documents notarised etc.
 Not in any rush, I have plenty of savings.

                              <span>TLDR: My experience in Vietnam is a treasure on my heart. 
 (Rant)I spent time there a few years back. An American in your beautiful country. I think of the smells, the people, the beauty, and the food. Your kindness to me and my travel mate was second to none, from the south to the north. I know it may be required of your culture to be &quot;nice&quot; when you really want to say what needs to be said, but I saw a humble care of the world in which the Vietnamese live, which includes naive tourists. Always kind to me, which I am not used to.
 As an American, I am so thankful for your hospitality. From my perspective, I would have so much animosity towards people like me. Maybe you keep it to yourselves. Or maybe, you just want to move on. A humble strength in family and kindess. 
 Vietnam is one of my fondest memories. I treasure it. I spent a night on a boat in Ha Long Bay. Although I was drunk and silly, the crew invited me and my girlfriend to the kitchen. Vietnamese food and a strange, ridiculously strong sangria. One of the greatest experiences in my life. It was like 345 in the morning!
 I got to sleep in. And the crew, who I think several were celebrating birthdays, were up at like 5! Being hungover on a boat while working sounds impossible. They did it, cause they had to. Tourism is likely the (I don&#x27;t know) biggest money makers for Vietnam these days I imagine.
 My last night, I got a tattoo on my inner left forearm in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh). I hear that many people tired of their tattoos when they see them everyday. For me? I wax nostalgic and think of how amazing Vietnam was. How it is. And how it treated me and my friend. 
 Not only do I have a great experience. But the people of Vietnam make me want to be a better person. I try everyday. Be humble. Be kind. Make good pho. Regrettably, the latter tastes like salty water. I&#x27;ll keep trying.
 I miss Vietnam. Thank you.

                              <span>I’m a Viet-Kieu who happened to grow up with a very strict Asian mom. I know my mom uses tough love on us but I’m not sure if my mom went out of line disciplining my sister and me.
 These are some of the things she did:
  
She spat and bit me after I didn’t want to wear formal clothes to my friend’s birthday party at age 8. She then clapped and laughed at me after poking holes on my pants with scissors. I cried so hard that day.
 
She cut my pajama pants for refusing to wear anything above the knees.
 
Told me “it was such a huge mistake giving birth to you”.
 
Pour food on head after refusing to eat( I was three at that time).
 
Beat my sister so hard she bled from her mouth when she was 4-5 y.o.
 
Kicked me in the back.
 
Called me “thang dong tinh”( similar to the f-slur) and splashed tea at me for reason number 2 (luckily the tea was cold at that time).
 
Screamed and calling me “thang cho”( a dog) for not bringing a ruler to school.
 
 This happened to me when I was 6-12 y.o. My sister told me my mother was abusive but I don’t think she was since I’ve seen some of my Vietnamese relatives’ parents who did stuffs way worse than my mom did.

                              <span>Hello, for context I&#x27;m người Việt born in the US (việt kiều i guess haha), moved to Saigon for ages 4-12, then back to the states for the rest of middle school, high school, uni, and now work here. My parents are from mixed backgrounds, dad a boat refugee from a military family and mom a very upperclass business family in real estate. I&#x27;ve considered moving back after getting a job offer but ultimately decided not to purely because it wouldn&#x27;t further my career, at least not in the industry I&#x27;m in. Really did consider it though since I got lots of family there too
 That being said, I do have very mixed feelings of the current government. On one hand, they freed us from all our colonizers which is something I think all of us feel very proud of and it just feels liberating, you know, knowing…</span>

 For my job it&#x27;s important to use ChatGPT, as far as Microsoft blocked the product for Vietnam, I should use it via VPN and Telegram bots.
 However, maybe you know a more convinient way?

                              <span>It probably hasnt been discussed on here much, but curious to see thoughts on the gender disparity.
 Vietnam has the 5th highest in the world , with 111.4 male births (currently) to every 100 females: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sex-ratio-at-birth?tab&#x3D;table
 This has been a social trend in the country for 30-35 years, but it has accelerated dramatically over the past 10-20 years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Vietnam#/media/File%3AVietnam_population_pyramid_01.04.2019.png
 Any thoughts on this? I can imagine some pretty concerning social issues arising from this in future (if not already)

                              <span>Sorry if this is not an appropriate place to post this, but I wasn’t sure what other subreddit to post this to.
 I met a Vietnamese guy on a tour last year in South America. We stayed in touch and when I went over to Thailand, we decided to meet up there. I’ve noticed that he is not that polite to hotel and restaurant staff as well as drivers. For example, he doesn’t say thank you when staff brings his drink or food to the table ever. He doesn’t say thank you when we are leaving the restaurant and they are saying thank you and goodbye. He’s not mean to them or anything, he simply ignores them. We hired a driver and instead of walking a few meters to meet the driver, he insisted the driver come into a very tight spot even though it was super inconvenient for the driver to have to back out. I tried to tell him we can just walk up to a more convenient spot and he said no, that we are paying the guy so we will wait for him to come to us.
 I’m wondering if this is just a cultural thing? I am ethnically Vietnamese, however I grew up in the US and my attitude is completely different (I’ve also worked in the hospitality industry so maybe I’m hypersensitive to this). I grew up being taught to be extra nice to hospitality workers because they work very hard but make very little. I get a sense from him that he sees them as beneath them. Is this a common attitude towards staff in Vietnam?

                              <span>Although there is some similarity to other neighboring countries, our culture as well as clothing still have clear differences. For example, Vietnamese smoke Thuốc Lào, eat Trầu, dye their teeth black, wear darker color outside and colorful inner Áo Mớ Ba Mớ Bảy, and hair keep hair loose. In clothing, we have many hats like Nón Quai Thao, Nón Đinh Tự, Toàn Hoa etc. Just like the chest wrap skirt in the video, we Vietnamese use it with a Round collar robe - Áo Viên Lĩnh inside with hair covering fabric; while others don&#x27;t.
 The project takes 1 year to complete and more than 5000$. All are self-funded. If you are interested, please support the full video here on Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;B06Pvic1TM0.

 There is one phrase written in Nôm script, can anyone guess what it is? 😋

                              <span>Hello,
 I don&#x27;t want to be disrespectful, but I have a sincere question. 
 I spent a night in a sleeping bus in a lower cabin and the guys from the company had no choice but to sleep on the ground between cabins. One guy spent the entire night spreading his legs right and left, and doing so, he was touching my bottom all night long. I could not sleep because it made me feel really inconfortable. I tried many times to push his legs, but he would do it again, and again and again. 
 I don&#x27;t understand, because I thought it was very disrespectful to touch people of the opposite sex?
 Is it normal? How should I react if it happens again? Can I ask him to stop doing it or would he be angry? 
 Thank you for your answers

                              <span>Serious question here. Why do so many Vietnamese burn garbage? Outside of the traffic situation, burning of things and the resulting air pollution it causes is without a doubt the most negative aspect of this amazing country. I don’t get it as everything I have seen on fire could have easily been put on virtually any curb for pickup by the garbage crews at least in the cities where smoke impacts a lot of people. 
 It makes me so mad as it not only affects my health, but more so, that of babies and children who are more vulnerable plus ALL of you who live here. Why is this not something the government is cracking down on as the trickle down health effects surely are taking a toll on the nation...even just cognatively as it effects your brain too. Plus, who wants to constantly be getting whiffs of burning plastics and whatnot on the daily? It is 2023 and we KNOW better, so why the ignorance in this particular area here? 
 If you burn things on the regular basis…why? Can you please shed some light as to your motivations? 
 From Wikipedia:
 “The World Health Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.[6] Studies published in March 2019 indicated that the number may be around 8.8 million.[127] A 2022 review concluded that air pollution was responsible for 6.67 (5.90–7.49) million premature deaths in 2019. It concluded that since 2015 little real progress against (superordinate) pollution, which remained at ~9 million earlier deaths, can be identified.[128][19]00090-0-19) Causes of deaths include strokes, heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections.[6]&quot;

                              <span>As the title suggests. I’ll be arriving in Hanoi on an afternoon and would be looking to navigate to Ha long bay that very moment.
 Planning on spending an evening + next day there. Recommendations for a day cruise or a cruise which maybe starts in the evening and goes up until the next day in the evening?
 Looking to do activites such as Kayaking and swimming.

                              <span>Hoping someone has some experience on what may be the best approach. For my last two days in Vietnam, I&#x27;m struggling to decide on two different scenarios. I&#x27;m not deterred by long days and aim to do as much as I can. I&#x27;ve heard Ha Long Bay is more touristy, so I&#x27;d like to avoid that if possible. But here are what I&#x27;ve found to be the best scenarios - so if there are other options that I am not thinking of, please share!
 Option One: Day trip excursion from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay. Lasts ~12 hours and allows me to book another one day excursion from Hanoi for the second day. I feel like this will result in roughly 6 hours total of travel back and forth for each day, so seems like I am not getting the most out of my days. But, may allow me to see something else I haven&#x27;t considered for a day trip.
 Option Two: Depart early AM via train or bus to Cat Ba Island, arriving midday. This allows some brief exploration of Cat Ba National Park. However, the following day it is unclear to be me if I can actually see Lan Hay Bay. I will be leaving out of Hanoi at 2300hrs that night, so need to be back to the airport around 2000hrs. It looks like my options to get back to mainland are to ferry at 1530hrs (ending my day prematurely) or at 1730hrs (getting back too late). Would it even be possible for me to see Lan Ha Bay in this time? The only thing I&#x27;ve found only is departing from 0800 and not arriving back to the island until 1500, which means my only option would be to take the ferry back at 1730. I&#x27;d like to make this option work, if I can, to see the mostt of the island but looks like the timing doesn&#x27;t quite work :(
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Thinking of visiting in August/September and keeping my trip focused on Hoi An and Huy. I’m looking for long walks and beautiful scenery, good food, great cafes I can read in for hours and people watch. No budget. As an aside, watched The Scent of Green Papaya years ago and thought the scenery was gorgeous, looking for that kind of ambience. Thoughts? Recommendations? Naysayers? All appreciated, thanks!
 Edit: no, not switching my trip to Boulogne. Ignore the movie set dreams.

                              <span>Hey fellow travelers! I recently arrived in North Vietnam and I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for off-beat places to explore. While Hanoi was amazing, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of the city and immerse myself in the beautiful nature of this country.
 But my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I arrived at Ha Long Bay. The pictures I saw online were nothing like the reality I experienced. It was crowded with tourists and heavily commercialized. I needed to find a hidden gem!
 That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m turning to you, fellow travelers, for help. Do you know of any hidden spots in North Vietnam that are off the beaten path? Maybe a secret waterfall, a secluded beach, or a quaint village with friendly locals?
 I&#x27;m on the hunt for something unique and authentic. Something that&#x27;s not overrun with tourists and where I can truly experience the beauty of Vietnam. So, if you have any recommendations, please share them in the comments below!
 Let&#x27;s help each other escape the tourist trap and discover the hidden treasures of North Vietnam.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I wanted to kindly ask for any advice and recommendations regarding possible job opportunities in the tourism/hotel sector of Da Nang/Hoi An. I am 32 years old, originally from Germany. I have BA degree in Southeast Asian and American Studies. I am considering to do a second degree in Tourism/Hotel-Management at an online university in order to be able to work while studying. 
 My overall CV has a lot of &quot;holes&quot; in it, because in my 20s I spent quit a fair amount of time traveling around the globe. I worked seven years as a freelance journalists with a main emphasis on tourism; had countless jobs in restaurants; worked for a company specialized in book trade; and, more recently, been employed as a social worker at a school in Germany. I also have my own little side hustle going on, selling records/cds/cassettes. In addition, I speak Indonesian and Malay, and I am currently trying to advance my Vietnamese language skills. 
 In the near and distant future, I&#x27;d like to live and work in Da Nang. I spent a fair amount of time in the city in the recent decade, and I feel very much at home there. My girlfriend lives in Da Nang, too, and we are in committed long term relationship. Therefore, I am considering to find a suitable occupation for myself in the city, and I can picture myself doing a good job in the tourism sector. Online, though, I can barely find any job ads. 
 I&#x27;d be very grateful if anyone could give me some honest feedback if I&#x27;d be able to get a work permit in the tourism sector in Da Nang with my background; and if so, I&#x27;d appreciate any tips on what to keep in mind, what to be careful about, and so forth. 
 Thank you so much in advance! &#x3D;)

                              <span>Apparently I&#x27;m providing technical support as a volunteer for a ceremony in my University (NEU Career Week) and i&#x27;m tasked with making Powerpoint slides, lighting, etc.There will be parts where music is needed such as giving prizes, awards, introduction of sponsors (yes, money is involved).
 I was going to use video game themes for them, some are actually from Nintendo. But upon reading about copyrights, i thought it&#x27;d be much safer top use something different.
 My question is if I use a popular song in the ceremony, will there be accusations of copyright infringement? I&#x27;d like apologize if I asked something dumb, but I&#x27;m a 2nd year student, still got a lot to learn, and this is my first time doing such important thing.

                              <span>👋 Hi Please don&#x27;t laugh at me but my partner sent me 2 packs of Viet pancake mix and a bottle of fish sauce. I&#x27;m so rubbish at cooking but trying to learn and I&#x27;m not doing to bad. I just need a simple recipe for the pancakes. I have bacon and shrimp and spring onions for the pancakes.
 The fish sauce dip I have nooooo clue what it&#x27;s supposed to taste like. I&#x27;ve never tasted fish sauce before. I have lemon 🍋 sugar and the fish sauce. I don&#x27;t have any chili flakes as I&#x27;m making it for my 8 year old daughter too (also I&#x27;m a stereotypical English WF who can&#x27;t handle too much heat! Wahhh ) So any simple step by step for the dip please 🙏 My partner is coming over to visit and I want to impress him.

                              <span>I will be visiting VietNam very soon on vacation. My husband and I have a few tour guides and drivers that are helping us on our tour of the country. We are obviously planning to tip generously for their service but we thought an additional small gift from the US might be a nice touch. Obviously nothing too elaborate but a nice token as a friendly cultural exchange. I&#x27;m looking for ideas of something easy to pack. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I just wanted to share an interesting story of what happened to us at Gibbon trek. We have tracked down family of four female, male and two babies all foraging and playing. They seem to have a lot of fun amongst each other, especially the babies. About 30 minutes of watching them they have decided to leave the tree and go further. Male Gibbon went directly above us and let it rip, the poop showered us, my camera, clothes, and my girlfriends clothes. Anyone got similar experience with Gibbons? Our guide told us this never happened on his treks, so I&#x27;m just wondering. Amazing experience anyway, would get pooped on by a wild Gibbon any day. 10/10.

                              <span>Just looking at something like a passport power index doesn’t answer this question because almost every European country requires a visa for Vietnamese tourists. 
 But there is a big difference in how hard it is to get a Schengen visa vs. say a Moldovan visa.
 What are some of the easiest European visas for Vietnamese to get?
