                              <span>About to fly from Hanoi to Canada and got a brand new tablet still in its original packaging untouched in carry on. 
 Anyone who flew with new unopened electronics in their carry on out of Noi Bai before -- did they make you unbox your device at security to put through the x-ray scanner? or can you just scan it with the box and packaging and everything still intact? 
 Should I just store it in my checked baggages instead? The device&#x27;s battery is under 100Wh (75Wh) -- both Canada CATSA and the U.S. FAA allow it to be checked in, just needs to be turned off and well packed.

                              <span>As a member of the diaspora, I had never heard of nÆ°á»c cháº¥m until I heard some white people saying it. My family has always just said nÆ°á»c máº¯m, with the type, either being nguyÃªn cháº¥t or pha, understood by the context of what food we were eating. 
 I know in America at least Vietnamese cuisine is largely stuck in the 70s. Is this a phrase that has always existed, or is it a new word? I only really hear it from hipster white people who love categorizing and labeling things.

 . Another incident occurred that same summer.
 Iâm kinda messed up by it. Anyone else?

 What is the probability of me encountering a centipede in here? What can I do for lowering the chance of meeting them closer to 0?
 I heard there are a lot of nasty and scary crawling things around. I want to feel safe at home and not be constantly thinking of some scolopendra crawling up on me.. brrr...

                              <span>My friend is Vietnamese and is having his wedding in January in Vietnam and weâll spend a few days doing touristy stuff before. I gotta go because heâs a good friend and plus I really want to. Problem is that I have a mild tree nut allergy and deadly peanut allergy. My friend promised heâll translate and wonât let anything happen to me but Iâm worried that either he wonât say the right thing, the chefs wonât understand what that means or there will be cross contamination because food allergies arenât really a thing there as yâall probably know, and they may not follow strict food guidelines like they do not the states. Any tips for a fella in this situation? My plan is to stick to white rice and McDonaldâs as much as possible but idk if I can do that for 10 days.

                              <span>Canadian tourist here. 
 Iâve spent the last month travelling Vietnam, starting in the north and working my way south. I arrived in HCMC a couple days ago and have noticed a ton of places have a security guard sitting on a plastic chair outside. A lot of these seem to be restaurants or higher end retailers. 
 I didnât notice anything like this in any other Vietnamese city Iâve visited and Iâm curious what the difference is. Are there a lot of thefts in HCMC? Is it to make sure nobody accosts tourists? Is it just to make places seem so fancy they need a guard? They seem to mostly be browsing their phones but maybe Iâm missing something. Whatâs with all the protection?

                              <span>Here are my thoughts on my visit to VN after living abroad for 38 years
 1) shocked by the traffic Pedestrian and motorized vehicles completely mixed together 2) not accessible to handicapped 3) service is top notched if you interact with people on a personal level . lots of self employed people , owners are always on site and care about their business 
 I ordered a birthday cake and the bakery will deliver to the restaurant!!!!
 4) in the absence of personal interaction, people behaviour is just horrible , pushing others , never wait in line (I.e. when I was at the airport )
 5) phone service is so cheap , everyone is glued to their phone 
 6) the gap between the rich and the poor is just too much

 I mean, we&#x27;re all stuck in the same situation, right? It feels counterproductive and just adds to the noise and stress. Anyone else feel the same?

My education was in a country and time very anticommunist, and I have discovered prosperous VietNam about 5 years. My formation is in Physics, so I am a late student about Marxism.
 Here in Brazil, most of people believes USA won VietNam war and that your country is a big and poor &quot;gueto&quot;. I got surprised (5 years ago, when I began to search for &quot;where socialism works well&quot;) to discover Vietnamese heros beated the Yankees.
 I have much respect for all Vietnamese people, you are heros or hero&#x27;s sons and daughters. I want to learn much about dialectic materialism and how your children are educated to build a so great country and nation.
 Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t speak Vietnamese, so I use Yankee-idiom. I tried to learn your language, but it was hard to me, so I&#x27;m learning mandarin first, so I could familiarize with a softer tonal idiom first.
 Love and respect to you Vietnamese!
 Peace among us, war to the lords!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am travelling to Vietnam from the 2nd to the 12th Initially I had planned for go from HCM to Da Nang, chill in Hoi An for a bit and go where the wind takes me for the rest of the holiday. Ideally wanted sunny weather, heat with diving and lazing on a beach. I&#x27;ve been doing some more research and checking 10 day forecast and a lot I&#x27;ve read is that the weather is potentially going to be the complete opposite of what I was wanting. 
 Can anyone give me some insight on where else I should go for my beach holiday or regardless it&#x27;s going to be a toss of the dice no matter where I go? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Me (29M) and my partner (28F) will be spending Christmas in Vietnam this year. We are either going to be in Da Nang/Hoi An or Nha Trang. Which would be better for 2 backpackers to spend Christmas? We will probably be in a hostel and will try and meet other people doing the same as us. Just wondering which is nicer, we are not looking for a western Christmas.

                              <span>Travelling to Southeast Asia this fall and realized we&#x27;ll be in Vietnam during the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. We&#x27;re flying in and out of Ho Chi Minh City but we&#x27;re also planning to move around the country (like to Hoi An, Phu Quoc, etc.) so our itinerary isn&#x27;t set in stone yet. 
 Any festivities to check out or must-dos for Tet Trung Thu that might influence where we want to be for that day? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I posted previously about the lethal Ben Thanh market. Today I visited Saigon Centre and my faith was restored! Itâs probably a tourist trap but there was many lovely vendors. No pushy or forceful people. Maybe one or two but only in the minority. I could browse easily and didnât feel like anyone was going to shout at me. 
 I didnât buy anything today apart from a scarf. Can anyone tell me how the bargaining works here. Some said fixed prices some said give me your price. I tried halving but some âsaid sorry no we cannot do it.â Then we came to an agreeable rate But it was only the vendors I purchased from. I didnât barter with others but the price was really high for some stuff. 
 Any help?

                              <span>Hello my fellas! I am competing for a case competition, so I really need your help. The case is about fish sauce. I hope you can help me answering a few questions so that I can understand more about the market.
  
What makes you/your family member choose fish sauce? (packaging, taste,â¦)
 How can you tell between poor fish sauce and tasty one? 
 What do you prefer: bad fish sauce at a reasonable price or tasty fish sauce at a higher price?
 Are you willing to try new fish sauce that you have not tried before, or youâre going to be loyal to fish sauce that you like?
 What aspects of fish sauce do you care more about: smell, color of the fish sauce, or both? 
 To what extent do you think fish sauce is unique to Vietnamese daily cuisine?
  
Please help me win this case competition. Thank you! â¤ï¸

                              <span>My boyfriendâll come back ð»ð³ in November to visit his family after 4 years in Germany.
 He agreed to let me travel with him (I begged him 100 times ð).
 He informed his family about me. His dad, big brother, sister in law and younger sister were very excited, and his mum seemed neutral.
 We would spend 5 days in Hanoi with his family and visit Danang before coming back ð©ðª.
 His parents said I could stay in their house. They have a big house, so there are private spaces for me and boyfriend.
 I feel excited and concerned at the same time. Is it too âfriendlyâ if I stay in their house? Or staying in hotel is safer option 
 What should I do to maintain good relationship with them as a westerner? If I stay with them, I can join their daily activities (cooking,â¦) and thatâll be fun ð
 I prepared some gifts for his little sister. Sheâs so sweet.

                              <span>I noticed that the prices to add extra luggage are different on web browser (22 USD) and the app (13.66 USD). And the cheaper app one wonât let me purchase it for some reason. Are we able to purchase extra luggage at the airport a few days before? I feel like my luggage (20kg) that I purchased will be heavier once I leave the country.

                              <span>Besides the government structure, what is socialist about Vietnam. It seems to me like people here operate on the most extreme capitalist mindset even more so than capitalist countries. There are more social safety nets, social goods, social ideologies in Europe, Australia, or USA, than there are here. Just as a quick dumb example: there are way more parks and public areas in any of those countries than here. And the few ones that there are here always end up overrun with people trying to sell crap. In &quot;capitalist countries&quot; more people tend to agree collectively to leave public places for the public. They (usually) tend agree to pay taxes to fund all sorts of social services. It seems to me that in Vietnam everyone is always chasing the most minor personal gain even at the cost of social advancements for all. What is social about Vietnam?

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m from PH and I&#x27;d like to ask where to buy these delicious cream filled cookies? I was able to taste those when my co-workers came back from Vietnam. And needless to say I&#x27;m instantly hooked with its taste!! 
 Can it be shipped here in PH? I&#x27;ve been craving them ever since.

                              <span>I am a Vietnamese-American who traveled to Vietnam to see my family and I happened to meet a girl at a spa on my last day in Vietnam. (It was at a highly rated spa with legit services)
 I thought she was attractive so I started up a conversation to get to know her and she said she didnât have a boyfriend. I got her instagram and we started to talk for a month. She was very enthusiastic (never one word answers) and flirty with all her responses except I always had to start all the conversations. I recently told her I was really interested in her but that it would be difficult for us to maintain a relationship being so far away from each other and she said she was interested too and that if we âreally lovedâ then it would work. 
 However, I went through her instagram followers and found her boyfriend that she has been dating for like 9 months. She doesnât have any photos of him on her instagram but the boyfriend has all the photos of her on his profile. 
 After finding out, I didnât confront her about it and immediately stopped messaging her and she hasnât messaged me either but that wasnât surprising to me because I was always the one to start the conversations. I guess I can understand why now because she has a boyfriendâ¦ Even though, we havenât talked for a week, she still shows interest by liking my instagram stories.
 My question is why would she deceive me like this and waste all of my time? Was she ever actually interested in me?
 Part of me just wants to screenshot all the messages and send it to the boyfriend

                              <span>I live away from my family for just 10 years. However, the relationship between me and my parents was never good. I am close with my sister and my niece but the last time I saw them was 7 years ago. To be fair, we are all different people now. Although we text, call, talking in person is still another thing. 
 I left the country for education, for work but I also wanted to stay away from my family. Just typical Asian parents problems. Since moving away from them, our relationship got somewhat better, just because I donât have to deal with bullshit anymore.
 I tried to put a smile on my face, I told my self that they will just stay for 1 month, I will be okay. But just 30 mins and I already felt depressed. It started with they filming me the second they saw me at the airport, shared it on Facebook and Tiktok, then with them trying to âhelpâ me. Then they took off their shoes and put their feet on another seat when we were on public transport. I understand their motives, I just couldnât stand it. The things they talk about, I canât join. The things they do, I am not comfortable to. The cultural difference between us is big enough to keep us apart.
 I am worried that this trip will push me and my family away even further. 27 more days to go, and I donât know how I should approach it.

 Coconut milk is also common in some drinks that I&#x27;ve order.
 It make me wonder what other combo is there that I&#x27;m not aware of.
 Nutella sound like a good idea in theory, but has anyone adventerous enough to test this yet? ð

                              <span>Hi sorry for asking this again, but previous reddit threads on this topic are outdated and don&#x27;t seem to be relevant anymore.
 I&#x27;m coming to Vietnam in the third week of September and my dream for this trip is to do some deep water soloing. I&#x27;ve never done it so I&#x27;m in need of a guide. (I am an experienced boulderer, but not the greatest swimmer. I&#x27;m trying to get over my fear of jumping in the water from heights....)
 If anyone knows any current climbing or adventure companies that organize tours or day trips or even just some guy with a boat and a topo I&#x27;d be psyched to hear about it!

 I will be visiting your beautiful country from January to March next year
 I&#x27;d like to spend most of my time near the beach, but still have good infrastructure, so Da Nang and Nha Trang make sense to me
 Air quality and water quality (for swimming at the beaches) are important 
 Being able to walk or bike most places is also nice, though good public transportation helps too
 I&#x27;d also like to be able to make genuine connections with people (both locals and immigrants)
 What do you recommend?

                              <span>Hi, I am coming back to Vietnam for good soon from the states. I am wondering about the money in my bank account right now. Should I use Remitly to send the money back there (I&#x27;ve heard they have the option where you will be receiving dollar bills from the comfort of you home), and then I can go to &quot;tiá»m vÃ ng&quot; later to exchange them? Or should I paypal my brother&#x27;s bank account in Vietnam? Also, what is the best bank for me to open later when I&#x27;m back there? Thanks in advance for any comments.

                              <span>Hi, all! 
 I like music that&#x27;s considered on the alternative side, everything from pop punk to death metal. 
 Most of the Vietnamese people I&#x27;ve met like to listen to ballads, which I don&#x27;t mind but I would rarely put some on.
 My niece and nephew just showed me the 7uppercuts and I really liked their stuff. Currently Tron Tim is on a loop and it will be for a while. 
 Can you guys recommend me more alternative music? I&#x27;m currently in the mood for pop punk but feel free to send me heavier stuff.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Off the back of the post asking the opposite, curious what people love about it. I&#x27;ll start with the general night time environment, broad concept but I love the karaoke by the street, the lights, street noises, all of it, it&#x27;s so different to where I live (although I do prefer living rurally like I do) and it cheers me up just riding around HCMC on a bike at night.

 Meanwhile, 75.5% do not enjoy the luxury of fullfilling their needs due to low salary. In some special cases, few can cover only 45%.

 People are letting me off the lift. 
 People are apologising to me when walking in my way. 
 Iâm not experiencing any rudeness. 
 Iâm quite upset. 
 This thread has made me feel like this is not the real Vietnam. 
 Whatâs going on?

                              <span>This is a bit of a two part question. To preface for context - I am a Vietnamese person that grew up in the US. My Vietnamese speaking abilities is very bare-bones and simple. As such, when I went back to Vietnam, it was quite easy to identify me as a Viet-Kieu the second I opened my mouth.
 Now this prompted some thought and curiosity within me. For the typical local Vietnamese person, is it possible to identify the country that the VK person is from based off of their speech pattern/accent?
 Furthermore, do foreigners from different countries have different accents when speaking Vietnamese? For example, in the US, there is a distinctive difference between Latinos speaking english, Asians speaking English, Europeans speaking English, etc. As well, within those groups, you have subtler differences too. Like the French accent is different than the UK English accent. Vietnamese people speaking English have a different sound to Japanese people speaking English. Does this phenomenon occur in Vietnamese too?

                              <span>My brothers and i were born in the UK and went back to vietnam recently for the first time. it was a great experience but i noticed that even though we grew up speaking viet (it was my and my older brothers first language and my brother started speaking it right after learning english) almost everyone seemed to catch our Â« foreigner Â» (they called us viet kieu) accents pretty early on. in your opinion do most viet kieus usually have a strong accent ? if you are a local in VN what do viet kieu accents typically sound like to you and is it easy to know if theyâre foreign born even if theyâre fluent? Any tips on accent reduction at least while in vietnam? what are some sounds or words that distinguish the different accents/dialects ?

                              <span>Im studying abroad in france and thereâs a dish called âbobunâ here, itâs very popular and is often the first thing people point to when vietnamese cuisine is brought up. However i started to wonder if itâs actually vietnamese or more âviet inspired.â Itâs a relatively simple vermicelli salad with toppings like beef, egg rolls, veggies. Is it âauthenticâ? 
 Both of my parents are from vietnam but i was born in america, so i wouldnât say i was an expert on viet cuisine but i wondered if this is more of a fusion dish like orange chicken. My parents said they donât know any dishes called just âbÃ² bÃºnâ but that âbÃºn thá»t nÆ°á»ngâ exists in VN for example. Does âbÃ² bÃºnâ or anything like that exist in vietnam/vietnamese cuisine? if so what would be the closest to this dish?

                              <span>Anytime anyone says anything slightly critical of this country, the entire community will either be up in arms telling the foreigners to leave or insult them. Case in point the earlier âsatireâ post, and many comments defending rude behaviours. 
 I donât normally post or comment much, but the more I check out this subreddit the more I realise how terrible the mentality of the people in Vietnam is. 
 As A Viet diaspora, I really wanted to be proud of my heritage and culture, but it is just so hard. I am sure many second generation overseas Viets have this feeling as well. 
 Every time I see Vietnamese people from Vietnam while traveling overseas, the majority of them are extremely loud, oblivious to the people around them, and have terrible manners/ behaviours (eating with mouth open food flying everywhere like tf?). It is just so embarrassing every single time.
 Yes, Some polite behaviours are relative, however there is still a core set of behaviours that is consistent everywhere, such as, do not block the path, do not spit on the streets etc. One canât just hide behind the concept of relativeness and ignore reality altogether. 
 I am both sad and angry because I know the Vietnamese are capable, but they just refuse to change or listen to criticism.
 Edit: Future readers can observe the comments and judge for yourself.

                              <span>Hi, I have been to Vietnam several times and now seriously thinking of going back there again.
 When I was thinking about my itineraries, I wanted to find out some website where I can find some day-trip or additional tour etc, like Viator or Klook. Could anyone tell me how Vietnamese people find/book such activities for their own trip?
 Thanks in advance for your help and knowledge sharing!!

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be going to Vietnam next week. Has anyone from the US who uses ATT gone recently - how did you manage the phone? Did you get a SIM card or just pay the ATT daily fee? The latter seems like less hassle but I want to make sure it works.

                              <span>Hi, I know this was irresponsible of me, but I realized I did not bring enough of my birth control on a trip to Saigon. I was wondering if I could obtain more of my birth control in Vietnam/Saigon and where? It is a combination hormonal pill.

 Does anyone know of a Vietnamese based proxy service that can buy items from Japan (just store, don&#x27;t need auction) and know how to navigate the shipping of the item into Vietnam?

                              <span>Greetings,
 I recently had the experience of getting to spend 3 weeks in Da Nang for business.
 I absolutely fell in love with Vietnam and have more than a passing curiosity to pursue a life there when I have completed my current employment contract.
 The thing is, I didnât run into a single expat who wasnât someone from NZ/AUS and on holiday money/trust fund living. They werenât actually working, just long term hanging out.
 So for my expats who DO make a living contributing to Vietnamâs prosperity, what are some of the usual occupations expats do?
 My most current occupational background is in aviation maintenance , but I also have a masters in International Relations, and over 20 years of kitchen/food prep/food service. 
 I saw that thereâs no âpensioner visaâ, which would be nice because Iâm expecting a pension of around $3000/month in about 5-8 years, but I donât mind working past my first retirement.

 Hows the quality? And do you know anyone who has done it?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m moving to Vietnam soon and I would like to hear from people familiar with Bien Hoa City.
 What is it like? What are the things you enjoy or love about Bien Hoa? How does it compare to other places? Do people frequently travel to HCMC for quick trips? What are some nice sights to see or things to do in the area? Nightlife?
 Would love to hear some positive things, as I had my heart set on HCMC but I think Bien Hoa looks just as amazing and I think it would be a stepping stone into the country.

 As he juggled more than twelve Reddit tabs, bouncing between threads on r/Vietnam and leaving his objectively correct takes on topics such as âWhy is Vietnam so goddamn filthy?â and âWhy do the local barbarians chew with their mouths open?â McDooglestein told reporters that as a seasoned traveler from a very wealthy first world nation, heâs ânever been so appalled by an utter lack of mannersâ as he has been during his time in Vietnam.

 I&#x27;m curious if it really is the most widely spoken, or it just happens to be the one that&#x27;s internationally recognized?

 I&#x27;ll be coming to Vietnam for work, and as a first-timer in the country, I want to make sure I&#x27;m well-prepared for my arrival, and I&#x27;m looking forward to your insights on what to expect and how to handle the arrival process smoothly.
 If you&#x27;ve been to Hanoi Airport before or have experience with arriving in Vietnam, I&#x27;d love to hear from you! What are the steps you recommend taking upon arrival at Hanoi Airport? Any tips for immigration, baggage claim, customs, currency exchange, transportation, and getting settled into accommodation would be greatly appreciated.
 Additionally, if you have any advice on local customs, cultural norms, or must-try experiences in Hanoi, I&#x27;m all ears. I believe that learning from others&#x27; experiences can truly enrich my journey.

We have family that is currently working abroad over in South Korea and would like to wire transfer funds back to Vietnam to their family. Is there currently a service that allows them to accomplish this? I&#x27;ve looked into Wise, Remitly, Sendwave and a few others but did not currently see SK as a outbound remmitance, but only inbound for receiving. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m staying in HCMC for another week and planning on going to those big supermarket (i.e LotteMart...) to grab some Vietnamese ground coffee. There are so many choices to pick from which have made it difficult to choose.
 What are some of the brands you would recommend for quality Vietnamese ground coffee (Robusta)? If so, where to get them? Appreciate the help!

                              <span>But yet in other nearby countries like China, Thailand and Indonesia extreme underground metal is very popular?
 I read something somewhere that Vietnam is really culturally opposed to extreme metal. Why is this so?

Pizza 4P&#x27;s is not really my style. Basta Hiro is better and cool but again not American style. I&#x27;m thinking to try Red and Round Restaurant soon. Anyone know of a good American or New York style Pizza joint around here?

                              <span>Hi everyone! Iâll be visiting Vietnam during Christmas and Iâd love to learn some Vietnamese to be able to speak to my partners family. 
 I use Duolingo right now, however I feel like they donât explain the language very well and I need my partner to explain everything to me. 
 Does anyone know an app/book to help me learn basic conversations? 
 Thanks in advance :)

Iâve seen mixed reviewsâ¦ people saying it was good, other people saying it was okay, other people saying they got scammedâ¦ I canât make up my mind as I only have a few days there. I want to make sure Iâm eating the best of the best.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a foreigner living in Vietnam and I follow some &quot;meme&quot; pages on Facebook about ASEAN nations (such as Indonesia, Cambodia, etc) I always see a lot of teasing (and sometimes infighting) in the comments about certain topics such as how Cambodia can&#x27;t let go of the past (when it comes to their territory) and how Indonesia is bad at football but always &quot;talks big&quot;. 
 So to the Vietnamese users of this sub, how do you feel about each of the SEA countries? Aside from Vietnam (of course), which one is your favorite? (Probabaly gonna see a lot of &quot;anh em LÃ o&quot; comments here haha)

                              <span>My pick has to be food diversity and how creative we are with taking what our surrounding countries has to offer develop our own version that fits the palettes of the locals. If you look at many popular dishes we have today, many can be linked to France, Thailand, China, Philliphines, etc. One of our popular dish is literally called Che Thai for crying out loud.

 I was sleeping when I was bitten by this one, I looked up the information and only knew its name is &quot;ectomocoris elegans&quot; and belongs to the family of Hemeptera. If anyone has more information about it, please let me know. But now I can&#x27;t go back to sleep because of the pain ð¥². Sensation when bitten: pain (like being stung by a bee). After that, there was a burning pain in the tip of my index finger (because I bit the tip of my finger) but I stopped this pain by squeezing my index finger. Then wash with soap and use povidine 10%. Currently, my fingers feel a little sore (not too sore like the original), tight and numb in the first knuckle.

                              <span>Hi.
 A friend of mine living in France wants to marry his vietnamese girlfriend so he can have a longer visa, or she can leave the country to have a better salary (the ideal solution). He recently found out that his gf&#x27;s mom faked her birth year so she could legally work at 14. 10 years later, now that her mom isn&#x27;t responsible of her child fake birth certificate anymore (is it true?), she told the authorities about that. Therefore they believe mariage isn&#x27;t possible anymore and both fear the government repression.
 Is there any solution to that ? It&#x27;s difficult to find any informations about vietnamese government and law on the internet by not speaking or writing vietnamese well.
 Also, I personally fear that this could be a gigantic scam. Is it some deja vu story ?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello!
 My girlfriend (who is viet) and I are going to Vietnam in October. We&#x27;ve tentatively decided Oct 9th - 23rd or around there. Now I&#x27;ve been to Asia before and was in Hong Kong in april myself to visit my family along with my gf.
 I am wondering if I should be taking any preparations food wise , as I am aware that the food hygiene is not that great. I also don&#x27;t want a repeat of what I experienced as a kid in HK 20 years ago (diarrhea and the shits and vomiting) lol. In my experience, it was herbs and ice water that gave me problems, but I was wondering if I should be more careful?
 Second question is -Im bringing a camera along with me for travels, but its quite an expensive camera. My girlfriend was discussing this with me and told me to be carefeul about it being snatched. Therefore I am wondering i should take extra precautions with getting a security strap thats securely anchored so that no body can just snatch it away from me. Is theft an issue?

 Thanks

                              <span>Ive been in vietnam for 5 months, there is this custom that makes me feel very irritated. My friend( a vietnamese) whenever he has a friend that comes over to meet him, although the guy is sitting at the front, clear as day, his friend on a bike park right outside the street, spamming the honk like a madman, not even bothering take it inside and call my friend, what is that ? This is frustrating and i am thinking of finding a place to live elsewhere that is more civilized. Is this honking culture everywhere ? Or its just in the countryside ?

                              <span>Initially, I thought many of these women were taking bridal photos or that they were models. But then I just noticed local women almost every 10-15 min in nice dresses having their photos taken in all sorts of settings. Alleys, bridges, in front of abandoned buildings and steel gates. 
 And many will have 1-3 men with large lenses taking their photos. 
 Is this a typical tradition in HCMC / Saigon? Photos for online dating? Wedding photos? Social media flex?
 Visiting HCMC / Saigon for the first time. Havenât seen anything similar in other SEA cities.

                              <span>Currently traveling around Vietnam for the first time and loving it. I work in construction in Australia and so some things stand out to me. I have noticed that many things are done to a certain level and then finished poorly. We went to My Son today and I overheard a tour guide telling his group that the Cham would complete tasks perfectly to 80% and then poorly the other 20%. So is that still a thing here?

                              <span>I am travelling in Vietnam and I seem to have contracted food poisoning from somewhere. Of course I never think that something like this will happen until it does! I am wondering what does the sub think the level of hygiene is at in Vietnam in terms of food preparation? Also what are some of the places or foods I should avoid or signs to look out for to avoid this happening again?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a college student in Hanoi who is a thrift enthusiast and want to practice my English speaking skills.
 So I will volunteer to guide anyone who like thrifting to explore the real thrift markets in Ha Noi. I will help you bargain good price, find the place to shop for cool stuff, give you some tips to explore Hanoi, and maybe eat some street food while we go.
 Places im planning to go:
 - ÄÃ´ng TÃ¡c Market (all kind of second-hand stuff)
 - Äáº·ng VÄn Ngá»¯ Market (cheaper than ÄÃ´ng TÃ¡c and has mostly women clothes)
 - HoÃ ng TÃ­ch TrÃ­ Street (leather goods)
 All of these places are in Äá»ng Äa District
 Available time: 1 PM - 6:30 PM, every weekend
 Just sent me a message, I will create a group and then we will go together.

 Can you relate?
 âIf I go back to Vietnam, could I go with this person? And you realize no. They would not make a good travel companion, they would not get it. And if they do not get Vietnam I donât know whether I can be friends with them anymore. Thatâs a terrible thing to admit. Your perspective have shiftet. You cannot look at your old life the same way. When you know things could be different.â

                              <span>My mother is looking to move in September but am having trouble finding an airline that will allow to bring our family shih tzu along. He is a service dog and should be allowed in cabin. I have found a few that would allow him to travel to certain countries but is restricted when when it comes to flying into Vietnam. 
 Anyone able to successfully travel with a similar snub nosed dog with them? If so which airlines did you use?

                              <span>I will be in Da Nang in September and what to visit Ba Na Hills. Ill be staying at an airbnb near Da Nang Cathedral. I am planning on taking a Grab. But I dont know to where exactly. 
 Can I have a Grab take me to Sun World. I have fun there. And then can I walk to the Ga cÃ¡p treo Suá»i MÆ¡ - BÃ  NÃ  Cable Car Station? And from there I will take the cable cars up to Ba Na Hills? And to return, I would take the cable cars back down, and have a Grab pick me up from around Sun World.
 Also, does anyone have any idea how long the cable car ride takes?

                              <span>27 year old Female here. I am planning to travel to Vietnam in November along with my friend. We have not yet decided the dates. Is there any special time in November when events are occuring? For eg: events where we can witness fireworks?
 Also, in general, travel tips would really really help us! What places should we cover and what are absolute gems? Is safety a concern we should have? I am from India bdw. We are planning to book a return flight from a different city than the city we will be landing in since we wish to cover many places. Also, we will be in Vietnam for around 10 days. 
 I also wanted to confirm if USD is accepted everywhere. We will also be carrying Forex cards. 
 I really apologize for so many questions. This will be my first international trip. Really excited to visit your beautiful country and amazing people!!!
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I have a multi drug resistant bacterial infection that has failed all treatment options in Thailand. There is an antibiotic sold in Vietnam that i can use as a 3rd line treatment. 
 I am wondering i anyone who is traveling to Bangkok can buy it and take it with them. I will pay for the medications and give extra money. I am just very desperate at this point. I have suffered with this for months and I am afraid. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I notice that so many foreigners who are allergic to different kinds of foods traveling to Vietnam. But I barely see Vietnamese who have food allergies. Even if they have it, it is just very light symptoms like a little itchy or their skin turning red, not deadly like most foreigners. 
 Is there any explanation for that? why are a lot of foreigners allergic to foods versus a very small number of Vietnamese people?

                              <span>To be fair, only 1984 and Animal farm are currently banned (Homage to catalonia is in circulation) and you can still buy the english version of those books online or get the bootleg 2013 Vietnamese version that was discontinued by Nha Nam for $5-10.
 Ayn Randâs The Fountainhead is published by Tre Publishing (owned by Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union btw). AFAIK, itâs very popular among younger readers. 
 Fun fact: Ayn Rand was extremely vocal against the Vietnam War believing Communism would have collapsed without intervention (lol?) while the voice of America, John Steinbeck, publicly supported the war (in private, it was more complex than that). He also famously hated ideological orthodoxy i.e even calling champagne socialists âtemporarily embarrassed capitalistsâ (sound familiar?). This might be why it took until 2021 for Steinbeck magnum opus âEast of Edenâ to be released in Vietnam.

                              <span>Hello All,
 I have posted here a year or so ago about the difficulties of getting my daughter her birth certificate here. My wife is Vietnamese, I am American, and we live in Vietnam which is where my daughter was born. The birth certificate issue was due to us giving her a western name and no one here telling us you cannot do that and instead just rejecting the birth certificate. So we got that resolved and gave our daughter a Vietnamese name and now have her birth certificate so the next step is getting a passport so I can take them to meet my family in America.
 It has been atleast 6 months and no passport. The reason being is when we renamed my daughter we gave her my family name which is a single syllable 3 letter name. Previously it was my father in law&#x27;s name who is divorced from myâ¦</span>

                              <span>I just downloaded the app and registered. Then I realized that my number is registered to a different person. How did this happen? I bought this sim around January 2022. It was brand new. I still have the sim case (the card that the sim was attached to) I hid my number below the name. But the numbers that I circled, are those a phone number?

                              <span>im a viet canadian and growing up my parents always spoke about chinese people using âtheyâ and talked about them like they were super foreign and distanced from us. i get it because even though we have some cultural similarities like lunar new year we are still very different. however recently i found out that both of my parents each have a chinese grandparent who moved from south china to vietnam and assimilated long ago. there are no traces of chinese heritage within my family, no one has preserved the culture and language, itâs as if we are 0% chinese rather than 25% chinese. but honestly had i not inquired i never would have known. is this unusual for viets who are able to trace a chinese ancestor? do you consider yourselves viet-chinese or just viet? for my family i have always wondered why we donât acknowledge it or consider ourselves chinese when there is a significant part of our heritage that is from china, but culturally we are 100% viet, the only chinese culture my parents have is going to eat dim sum lol. so i donât really know if i can consider myself partially chinese when it was essentially erased. is it a common experience for any other viet people either in the diaspora or living in VN itself? if you had any chinese ancestors has your family retained any aspect of their culture now?

                              <span>I will be in Danang for work in October. 
 I was hoping to get a sports coat made. I have never had one made, so I dont really know the process. I was hoping for some recommendations of places to go. 
 I also need to find some souvenir shops. I dont want any food or purses or clothes. I am looking for statues ideally. So far, I have:

Those channel starting out kinda normal but then it getting weird in someway. Not be judging bc Im also watched these video a lots but like some fans start saying like this is just a scare story for midnight. Some people listen to this when work and sleepð. In conclusion, is this a okay thing? Or it gonna creating some problem in futureâ¦.

                              <span>I&#x27;m conducting research on expat-entrepreneurs in Vietnam and would love to have your insights. I would like to ask for your participation in my survey if you are an expat and want to/already open a business in Vietnam! The survey is only about 3-5min and every information is for research purpose only so please tell me if you are willing to help. 
 If you are not interested in survey but have anything to share about motivations behind expat&#x27;s business operation in Vietnam, give me a sign and I truly hope we could have a small conversation (not a lengthy interview ð ) about your story! Every single response is gonna help me a lot so I appreciate your effort and if you know anyone suitable please introduce to me.

                              <span>I was in my car parked stationary in a proper boxed spot, and got rammed into from behind by a motorcyclist. I even got the whole thing recorded on my rear camera. But dude was raving about not having to pay anything as in Vietnamese culture, the car is always at fault regardless of how the accident happened.
 The motorcyclist is also demanding cash via text now in compensation to fix his motorcycle, phone, and laptop (I exchanged phone numbers with him for my insurance claims). Damage is minor and i don&#x27;t plan on paying him a single cent. Just curious if this mentality is common.
 A Vietnamese friend of mine told me that its often true simply because car drivers are perceived to be more financially capable to bear the costs, even if they&#x27;re not at fault. If this is true, that&#x27;s pretty messed up. 
 Update: Motorcyclist is still trying to text and call me for cash. I suggested we settle this in the police station with my rear cam recording at hand. But he rejected. I&#x27;m starting to believe that this dude probably doesn&#x27;t even have a license.

                              <span>Iâll be traveling to Vietnam in two weeks. Iâll be in Saigon, Da Nang/Hoi An, and Hanoi (and the surrounding area perhaps). I am not on a backpacker budget but I figure for most of the trip there is still no reason to spend anymore than like 1,000,000 VND (30-40 USD) a night because the rooms are nice enough at that price. 
 But, this trip is somewhat of a celebration (just finished law school and took the bar) so at least once in the trip I would like to splurge, by Vietnamese standards, and get a really nice room. I guess like 3,500,000 VD (150 USD) a night. 
 I was thinking this would be best done in Da Nang because itâs on the beach and itâll will be a pretty relaxing part of my trip. It didnât seem necessary to spend too much in Saigon because Iâll be out and about all day and basically just sleeping at the hotel. 
 So, does this line of thinkingmake sense, and if so, can anyone recommend some more upscale places that youâve had good experiences at? Would like a nice pool and bar area, good food, service, etcâ¦ 
 Open to this stuff in Saigon and Hanoi as well just like I said, doesnât seem as worth it as Da Nang but open to being proved wrong. Thanks!

I could just drink that like soup, and I did.. haha I&#x27;m looking for a recipe for hanoi style bun cha sauce, I&#x27;ve seen so many recipes and I feel like most of them focus mostly on the meat preparation but I&#x27;m obsessed with the sauce I would love you input, maybe some family recipes?! Thank you:)

                              <span>I am travelling to Vietnam with a friend as an adult for the first time, and I need all the advises I could get. I know that we need to get an evisa to enter the country, but if we are heading out in mid-October, when should I apply for the visa? Also, can I use the same visa to leave back to USA? We will be there in October, so what will the weather be like? What would you guys recommend to pack, buy/bring? What are some places you guys recommend for us to visit? We are open to everything, but super excited to do some shopping (clothes/skincare/makeup,) food places, entertainments, and spa/massage etc. We&#x27;ll be staying in Saigon around Binh Thanh if it helps! Also, if there is any apps that would be useful for my travel, I would greatly appreciate it. FINALLY, please let me know what to avoid, and what are some well-known scams to look out to. Thank you in advance!

 Open to any suggestions.

                              <span>Iâll be going to Vietnam for the month of September with my boyfriend. This is not a hiking vacation, but we will do some touristy things Iâm sure. Heâs viet and Iâm American, but he moved when he was a child and I canât figure out what to wear and heâs not much help. Some people tell me just normal clothes, some tell me very modest attire. I know itâs hot and humid, so no way Iâll wear any jeans. Are tennis skirts ok? Should all dresses and skirts be ankle length? Is it offensive to see shoulders? I donât want to offend anyone, but I also want to be comfortable.

                              <span>Currently there&#x27;s been a lot of Vietnam bashing on behavior but it&#x27;s really unfair. Most middle class Vietnamese people don&#x27;t have the behaviors people come here to vent about. 
 I&#x27;m curious, is there a high society movement? Do people use the term &quot;high soc&quot; here?Are vietnamese trying to differentiate themselves as high society from low society? In Thailand all you hear is high soc low soc everywhere especially with the rich parents of the students.

                              <span>Iâm Vietnamese but born in Australia. Apologies for my ignorance but I need some perspective. My family said Vietnam dislike China and I want to get perspective from those who are living in VN atm. Iâll be visiting Vietnam in September for the first time with my husband. He is Malaysian Chinese who is also born in Australia. He has an Australian passport but his surname is very chinese. Will he get targeted for bribes at the airport? $20 is not much for us but itâs the principle. My dad said that they donât usually target younger people but I saw a few people here mentioning that they do. I canât wait to visit my motherland but a bit nervous as I donât know what to expect. Thank you

                              <span>I am going to Vietnam with my family soon and I was wondering how Grab works (both for rides &amp; food delivery) 
 Can I pay in cash or does it have to be only card? Does international credit card (VISA) work? Does it automatically convert from VND â&gt; USD when charged?
 I already let the bank know I am going to be in Vietnam. 
 Appreciate any advice, thank you!!!

                              <span>Hello! Will be traveling to Hanoi on the first week of September. I saw in my weather app that itâll be rainy but I just wanted to know how bad the rain would be? Would it be raining the entire day? And would Ninh Binh still be enjoyable even though itâs raining? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi my friends, would love to travel maybe even live in vietnam for a while but I might have a disease called celiac. itâs basically when even small amounts of gluten make you severely sick it is causing inflammation in your body and much more.
 I used to love vietnamese food here in germany but from my knowledge most of the dishes contain gluten at least here.
 Are there many dishes without gluten? is gluten free easily accessible on the country side? 
 Itâs actually so severe that I have to be careful going to restaurant because if someone prepares a meal with gluten ona table and then prepares a gluten free meal on it that might be enough for me to react and get glutened.
 advice will be appreciated &lt;3

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to preface my rant - I&#x27;m Vietnamese. Living in western culture my whole life. Travelled extensively all around the world. I got enough of a perspective.
 I don&#x27;t follow the sub closely, but lately I can&#x27;t help but notice the posts where the OP is really dumbfounded that a totally different Asian culture with a heavy history has it&#x27;s ways in day-to-day life and views?
 To me it looks like the certain disdain and irritation as in &quot;Why you guys aren&#x27;t like Bali, where the culture is all so westernized and easy for us to consume?&quot;
 It seems so natural for me that when facing a different culture and especially in a developing country I am very respectful and accepting of the way they are. Instead of being on a high moral ground and in a position of a consumer, I try to get to know the people, the culture and be thankful that I&#x27;m being welcomed to their home.
 UPD. Since people get confused about what I&#x27;m trying to say. There are things that are deeply rooted in the culture of a nation. That&#x27;s the &quot;otherness&quot; that people may or may not appreciate, but that&#x27;s unique to every culture.
 There are problems that arise from socio-economical background and are pretty common in Asia and all around the developing countries. Those are things no Vietnamese is proud of but we are on the track of dealing with them.

                              <span>Van den Brink said, &quot;We front-loaded our pricing. We ran into a pretty strong economic slowdown in the key market of Vietnam, which is disproportionately important to us.&quot;
 This is from the recent earnings report. Is Vietnam really experiencing an economic slowdown like this CEO said?

My 2nd cousin and I are the same age. I spend tonight like many nights before laying in the living room bed in the dark with multiple fans spinning and wondering how life could have been different. I wonder how life would have been like if the roles were reversed.
 17 years ago, I was 13-14 years old and visited Vietnam for the first time with my grandma and uncle and his wife. I spent a month in Vietnam and do not remember much but I do remember meeting the youngest great aunt and my 2nd cousin. I have happy and memorable memories with them.

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s a personal choice to eat how you want. And some foreigners also eat with the putrid sound of wet mushy food smacking back and forth while eating with their mouth open.
 But I find it to be much more common here in Vietnam. 
 To me, it&#x27;s one of those sounds that rattle my insides. Similar to someone rubbing a balloon or scraping on a chalk board. 
 I&#x27;m sitting at a coffee shop now and a couple just sat next to me and they are both mouth smacking their food for the past 10 minutes or so. Even putting my earbuds in and putting the volume high. I can still hear it
 I know others also find this sound irritating. And it&#x27;s obvious that people are able to eat without opening their mouths all the way 500 times during a meal and showing everyone the visuals and sounds of the first steps of the human digestion process
 I don&#x27;t say anything. I&#x27;m not being a Karen. But it&#x27;s absolutely disgusting. Why don&#x27;t friends say anything to these people? Or literally nobody cares and it&#x27;s enjoyable to eat a meal with these people as they make some of the most unappetizing noises? Why so common here in Vietnam? Like, the louder you eat your food, the richer you are? It brings you good luck or something? 
 Nasty noises from your mouth keep the ghosts away maybe? ð»

                              <span>Hi everyone! My partner and I have slowly started to look into potential baby names as we want to start a family soon. For reference, I am European Australian while my partner was born and raised in Vietnam. Any children we have will most likely grow up in Australia, though will frequently visit Vietnam to see family. We want to choose a first name that can easily be used in both Australia and Vietnam.
 We have been looking into Western first names that when shortened also sound like a Vietnamese name (this would be their nickname and also what they are called when in Vietnam). For example:
 (F) Maia (shortened to Mai) / (F) Maysie (shortened to May) / (M) Vincent (shortened to Vinh).
 Do you guys think this is too weird? ð Can you think of any other names like this?
 Otherwise, we were thinking of using a Vietnamese first name that is easy for English speakers to pronounce. Does anyone have any ideas?
 Opinions and advice would be great, thank you ð
 Edit: We are mostly struggling with male names, though recommendations for female names would also be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Me and my girlfriend will be traveling to Vietnam from end of August till mid September (23 days).
 We came up with the following itinerary: 
  
Ho Chi Minh
 
Hoi An 
 
Lang Co Beach 
 
HuÃ© 
 
Phong Nha â Ke Bang National Park
 
Nih Binh - Trang An 
 
Hanoi 
 
Sa Pa / Fansipan or Ha Long Bay (depending how we feel)
 
 You think this is viable? Or did we plan too much? Your input is very much appreciated!

I miss the cheap food, my family, the vibes, technically everything you can think of. But thatâs just life I guess, back to responsibilities and jobs.

                              <span>Probably we all know Vietnamese people get really uncomfortable with public displays of affection (kissing, hugging,â¦). Iâm curious about how family members show love in their daily life. 
 I (30F) donât remember the last time I gave my parents hugs or said âI love youâ to them. I love them dearly, but it feels really awkward for me to say loving words or be affectionate toward them. 
 In our nuclear family, we give each other big hugs and say âI love youâ every single day. My kids would get very upset if I forgot to do those things before rushing to work. 
 My parents at their 70s donât sleep together anymore, and I never heard them say âI love youâ to each other. I feel bad for them. I really wanna give my parents some support but thereâs always an invisible wall between me and them that I find it so difficult to break. 
 I wonder if my situation is typical in Vietnamese culture or is it just my family background? My parents rarely say sweet words, always try to suppress their feelings and emotions (except for anger and frustrations ð). They show their love by attentive care and share.

                              <span>Hi everyone! Iâll be traveling to Ho Chi Minh City in September with my boyfriend and his family from the United States. 
 My boyfriend grew up there until he was about 8 years old then he moved here. He has a self admittedly very limited knowledge of the culture, things to see, norms etc. but he and his sister keep giving me the idea that Iâll hate it there and be very uncomfortable; the food will be shocking, pickpocketers, massive pests, domestic abuse, and lots of personal judgment of me based on how I react but they arenât able to give me much specific advice of how to behave
 I donât want to go into this 2 week long trip with a negative attitude, so what are some things to look forward to on my trip? I know itâs a beautiful place with lots to see but I just donât know where to begin with all of these warnings about how bad it is
 Additionally, what are some cultural norms I should know about to make sure I donât offend anyone, get lost or put in a bad situation when I donât know the language?

I stop momentarily to look at my shoe and assess the situation and this guy just starts trying to untie my shoelace!
 I swiftly moved on when he started doing this but I&#x27;m still quite confused about this interaction. I don&#x27;t see what objective the man had in mind by doing this as obviously any sensible person is just going to respond to this by walking (or running) away. Can anyone enlighten me as to what was going on here? Could there have been anything particularly offensive about my shoes that warranted this behaviour?

                              <span>Having lived in Vietnam and other parts of asia for quite a while, there is one topic which is quite difficult to understand ; real estate and its pricing.
 My general observations to date :
 - Generally, land is highly sought after for both investment, speculation and living. They&#x27;re seen as an appreciating asset. Prices are eyewateringly high in major urban centers by global standards. Value is not in the home on the land (often knocked down quickly), but rather in the land itself
 - Condominiums are depreciating assets ; as they age, new projects pop up, generally the price tends to go down over time. That said, there are those who hope to buy a project off-plan (eg. before it is built), and then resell it by the time it is competed hoping to make money (arguably also speculation)
 - Foreigners face restrictions (cannot own land without complicated workarounds), and for condominiums must buy from a specific pre-allocated set of units in certain projects, which stays below a threshold (I believe 49%). Then there&#x27;s the leasehold structure of 50 years which may impact the sale-ability
 Would love to get input on whether this is right, what I&#x27;ve missed and what more there is to this.I still have lots of questions, such as :
 - Are vietnamese subject to the leasehold structure?
 -How firm ones individual rights are in the case the Govt plans some project that impacts ones residence?
 - To what extent is there predictability to the prices or if its just a FOMO (fear of missing out) speculation frenzy?- If condominiums generally depreciate, then is it really a worthwhile financial investment?
 -How are land prices set? is it wild west or is there a government appraisal / pricing process? if so, how come land prices even in fairly rural places are higher per square meter than for example, London?

                              <span>I hate that shit when I was a kid. Literally the most toxic thing to discuss about. Made me and many other people feel like shit and awkward. I donât know why this became the norm. Itâs like they think that because weâre kid, we donât have feelings and donât feel sad when adult talk down on us and compared us to other people. I know that in Vietnamese culture, respecting adults is utmost important even when what they are doing is wrong, which is probably why it has been happening for so long. Just imagine asking them back âwell why arenât you as successful and better shape than Chu Ut? You had more time than me at being successful, why are you comparing me to other kids?â Definitely will get the stick for that haha.

                              <span>Yesterday there was a post about Born Pinkâs concert stadium filled with trash after the concert had finished. There were alot of people who defended it using excuses such as: âOh all concerts are like that everywhere.â, âthey paid big buck for the tickets, they had the right to use the service.â,etc.
 Well, hereâs a few examples of Vietnamâs beautiful natural landscapes ruined by trash because the people donât give a shit about policing their trash.

                              <span>Some examples I picked up of the common vehicles:
 Honda PCX150 is 70 million in Vietnam and the PCX160cc ABS model is 47 million.
 Honda Jazz is 700 million in Vietnam and in Indonesia, it&#x27;s 416 million. That&#x27;s a difference of almost 300 million.
 Is there a big used vehicles market? Is it worth buying a used vehicle? If yes, what&#x27;s the best place to search it as Facebook marketplace isn&#x27;t commonly used here
 Are their brands that I should opt for instead of paying such a high premium that are perhaps taxed less in Vietnam like Vinfast or something similar?

                              <span>Heading to Hanoi this Fri (4th Aug) and we planned to head to Sapa for the next 2 nights (5th to 7th Aug).
 However looking at the weather forecasts (indications of heavy thunderstorms), I am wondering if it&#x27;s going to be worthwhile or are we better off staying in Hanoi and doing day trips to Ninh Binh etc. or even do Ha Long Bay. Besides the weather I am also concerned if the roads will be safe - we have booked a shared minibus (those that can seat 7 to 8) which will take 5hrs each way to/fro Sapa - any advice appreciated!

                              <span>Viet couple here. We went shooting in Pattaya. To be honest, shooting in Cu Chi Tunnels was much more fun, you got to shoot stuffs from WW2 even, and free to use your phone to record. In Thailand you can&#x27;t take any photo or video, and they charged 300 baht (210k VND) for 5 photoes and vids.

 A depiction of me dying a little inside wkwkwk
 TL;DR: Surely it must be possible to have short simple Vietnamese sentences that don&#x27;t sound and look all the same to a beginner?
 Hi, so, I started learning Vietnamese via Duolingo recently... DL is really not known for teaching you words in a logical order and often giving you weird starter examples but VN version is next-level to me. Sometimes it teaches certain really random words. Like starting with things like ong (bee) for Vietnamese. Mhh OK... Anyway, Indonesian is similar but it&#x27;s still great for daily vocabulary practice :)
 But I wonder... Is this what I will have to learn to read for real? I seriously feel like Duolingo curriculum creators are fucking with you in the first few lessons. Like why would you pick the name of the main antagonist to be An, and then you have your first sentences to be stuff like An Än anh Ã¢Íy. I&#x27;m making this example up because I forgot the exact ones, but the early samples have something like this where it&#x27;s just non-stop an&#x27;s and as a beginner you&#x27;re just like.... Mother of God LOL cmon bro.
 I feel like they legit put the most unfavorable sentences at the start to make you question if you want to learn the language O_o. I know that due to tones you can easily have many words that look the same but... It seems so unrealistic to me to have simple sentences in literally the beginner section and then teach something like &quot;Con cÃ¡ cáº¯n cÃ¡i ca&quot;... I feel like they do this on purpose LMAO... Am I just imagining things or should I just get used to being massively confused at the start of learning Vietnamese :D?

There are people in USA who are Vietnamese with children also of Vietnamese descent. Those children are demanding their parents purchase a Tesla for them, so they can learn to drive. I am looking for Vietnamese words to describe spoilt and self-entitled brats who have no clear thought of the struggles their ancestors went through.

                              <span>I entered a one way road by mistake while I was following google maps. There was no signage and the cops caught me. I expected a 500.000vnd maximum fine, but they took away my license and told me to pay 3Million or they won&#x27;t return it. 
 I tried telling them it&#x27;s way too much but the cop outright said if I keep asking him to reduce the fine, he&#x27;ll revoke my license. He wasn&#x27;t even ready to accept my reason. 
 I didn&#x27;t have that much cash so he told me to call a friend and ask or to go to the ATM and get it.
 Do I need to pay this much money every time they stop me? I&#x27;m a foreigner and I&#x27;m new to Hanoi. This was a horrible experience. I understand that they take bribes but 3mil was over the top!

                              <span>Just for context, my family are southerner and we immigrated to the US around 1970s to 2000s and I was always taught by my family that southern Vietnamese are often nicer and easier to hangout with when compared to the northern region. Based on my own experience and experience from my family, this is often true. My dad told that Northerner struggled a lot before and after the war and so they have to work hard to make money and get fed, and that often can translate to behavior of taking advantage of other people. What are your guys experience about this? Not trying to start any fights, just curious if this is something that people can generally agreed on or just a lens from my own experience and not neccesary apply to many others.

                              <span>What is the reality of finding a job in VN for an American ? My wife is Vietnamese and recently floated the idea of moving back VN ( Ho Chi Minh City )so her parents can help us raise our daughter. I donât speak Vietnamese. Iâm guessing Iâd be better off finding seasonal work in the US and see my family part time ? This is all hypothetical at the moment.

                              <span>I know, itâs been discussed many times, but i am curious to hear it from the latest visitors. Is a Ha Long Bay cruise worth it? On one hand thereâs a nice experience with good views ( as they say) - one another hand theres a 150â¬ price tag per person, rumors of tons of floating trash that ruins everything, lots of cruises that crowd the area, and it gets boring after a while? What is your experience, thanks

                              <span>Did I offend a bellhop?
 I was traveling with my family and allowed a bellhop to carry our bags into our room. Me and my wife stayed in our rooms and my children in another room. He gave us our luggage and my children tipped him 10,000 dong. At the time it was all we had to tip so we just left it at that. Strangely enough my children found the tip money slipped under their room door.
 Did the bellhop return it out of distaste that it was too little or any other reason? From what I can recall tipping is not mandatory and I thought that amount was better than nothing. Thoughts?
 *Edit: Thank you everyone for your input. I could understand it could be bc the tip came from my children and accepting it was against some moral code or out of pity. It also could be possible that he thought the tip was way too low; Ill never know unless I hear it from him.
 *It is very interesting to hear everyones opinion about tipping as well. I do believe that extraordinary service should be rewarded, but if a tip is given, it should be a worthwhile amount.

                              <span>Long story short, my parents didnât teach me vietnamese well in my childhood because they were scared I would have an accent when speaking english. I know basic vietnamese, especially when listening, but Iâm horribly anxious to speak it. Iâve bought books and flashcards and courses and still have been having trouble learning, partly because Iâm used to the southern dialect, which conflicts with a lot of resources on learning the language. Are there any tricks to learning vietnamese? I want to be able to visit vietnam and speak fluently and not look like some americanized idiot.

                              <span>I actually don&#x27;t give a shit about VN any more than any SEA country (although VN is lovely) but I can&#x27;t but notice all the anti-VN posts lately, and it&#x27;s weird for someone in SEA to hear complaints of:
 - Bad driving
 - Litter
 - Selfishness ?
 - Rats
 - Game shows
 - Toilets (paper)
 - Social Toxicity
 What&#x27;s going on? The last week this sub has faced a steady stream of complaints that VN has the same problems of all SEA nations. What&#x27;s happened? Did everyone decide to do on holiday to VN and then moan about it? Or has reddit decided to bombard me with silly posts.
 I&#x27;m really confused, what&#x27;s happening in this sub? I follow this sub to keep up to date with things in VN. I&#x27;m not that interested in complaints about the traffic and TBH I have no idea who is so shocked that traffic in a SEAsian nation is awful.
 IDK. Maybe I&#x27;m out of touch
 Eddit: And the next post I see is someone complaining about stomach upset from the local diet

I swear every time I turn them on, people on the game show are loud asf, thinking their jokes are funny when they say it out loud at 100000000 decibel. Moreover, why are there so many of them and they mostly have the same MC and directors?

                              <span>Hey guys! So my son will be born in a month. My wife and I have bought a lot of stuff but I was just reading on another Reddit page about how a lot of stuff you really donât need to buy new and you can find the majority of what you need on âbuy nothingâ groups, especially since a lot of the stuff is used for such a short term that itâs still practically new anyways. 
 I searched on Facebook hoping to find a local group like that in HCMC andâ¦nothing. Canât say Iâm surprised tbh ð but then again, maybe I wasnât looking hard enough? Please let me know if you are aware of a group like that for my area. Thanks guys!

                              <span>Itâs always a me-first attitude. You try to get out of an elevator, you have to avoid getting trampled by the people who bully their way into the elevator first. You try to cross a road, no one cares, they try to gun their motorbike to beat you there first. You try to walk into a narrow doorway and the person next to you does everything in their power to bullrush past you to get through first. No manners in this culture. I hate visiting here.

                              <span>So some of you probably heard of the shitstorm the influencer Thao Ni Le is going through at the moment. Although itâs nothing new at all that these internet celebs jump on any topic that promises to be generating clicks and views, itâs somehow still mind boggling to me that a Viet Kieu (from Germany) coming to Vietnam, rises to fame here, and then learning absolutely nothing about Vietnamâs history and touches a topic thatâs highly sensitive here. While on holidays. Via Instagram. 
 So my question is: What do you think about Viet Kieus coming to Vietnam and claiming to be genuine Vietnamese (obviously for career moves) and is the general public aware of that behavior?

 I&#x27;ll be moving to Hanoi soon, and was hoping someone could help suggest a great health club in Hanoi with access to a gym, pool, steam room, sauna (and cherry on the top - ice bath!) Does such a gym exist? And, if so, what would the rates be?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Iâm a Korean American expat based in South Korea the past 16 yrs. For the first time, my Korean native gf, her brother, and I visited Ho Chi Minh for a week July 22-28. I know the saying is visiting and living are two different things.. 
 Nonetheless, we had a blast. Stayed in an Airbnb at Vinhomes Central Park and went to a good mix of touristy foodie spots many near Ben Thanh Market and to local spots around the city where we couldnât use any English to order. 
 We were quite surprised by the weather temperatures as we were expecting hot weather similar to Thailand but it was rather cool the entire time. Itâs actually hotter and more humid in Korea right now.
 Never visited Bui Vien Walking street as my gf and I arenât heavy party-goers or drinkers (Iâm in my early 40âs and sheâs in her late 30âs and weâve had our fair share of debauchery in our 20âs and early 30âs). Her brother was keen on checking it out but we just never made it.
 The only thing I wish I was able to check out is the bjj/mma/combat sports scene as Iâve been training myself the last 9 yrs in Korea. Saw a few bjj gyms I wanted to check out but also didnât want to be selfish and take away from the time I should be spending with my gf and her brother. Am curious as to what the scene is like in Vietnam if anyone that trains would care to share.
 Here are some photos of our trip as well. A bunch of the clichÃ© touristy spots. Iâm also a photographer so I prefer shooting with my dslr rather than a phone and edited the photos in my editing style which might not be the best or most realistic representation of the places. But these the ones Iâve shared to my sns. 
 We absolutely loved Ho Chi Minh and are keen to visit Hanoi the next time we make it back.
 Been lurking in this sub the last week to gain insight into this fascinating country and would love to hear any and all experiences, both good and bad, from those actually living here if anyone cares to share.

                              <span>What does a real &quot;local&#x27;s&quot; party look like? My wife is Colombian and thinks that Vietnamese people don&#x27;t really party...they only drink beers and sing karaoke at home...All the clubs in the cities are for Westerners playing the same stupid songs over and over... Are there real Vietnamese dance parties? Huge clubs or events where people dance, drink, laugh, and get sweaty all night? If so, where?! What type of music are people dancing to? What districts do these things happen in? Are there any good videos of the party scenes?

                              <span>I was at night market. Went to the clothing shop. Two ladies were bargaining for something. And one of them was repeating &quot;Give me for 210 and I&#x27;m gonna leave you alone&quot; many times. Dude was fixed at 250. But they were pushing him so hard to go for 210. Also they were talking in English very fast. So he couldn&#x27;t understand anything except number 210. I mean I know you can bargain but isn&#x27;t it too much? Or is it pretty common to haggle at that level?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 so I got addicted to coconut coffee, and especially the roasted (I think) coconut pieces on the top of it. Anyome knows what its called, and if I can buy that in shops? I will be eternally grateful, and pay for your first 5 beers in Hanoi or HCM.

                              <span>My grandmother recently passed away in February. I wasnât very close to her, but my family asked if my mom and I were going back to Vietnam next year for my grandmotherâs first death anniversary. My mom definitely intends on visiting for 3 weeks, and she asked me if I can request work off to go with her (for 2-3 weeks). I currently work at a ski resort, and February is our busiest time of the year. To be honest, I donât really want to go. I feel uncomfortable staying with my family for various reasons; I would also be going from below freezing now in high elevation to a humid tropical climate, but most of all I always feel anxious around my Mom. I had also been talking about and planning a trip with my partner to go to Italy for a week in March, so Iâm not even sure if Iâd be allowed to take that much time off in such a short amount of time. My mom says the first death anniversary is very important, so would I be ostracized by my family if I donât go?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t mean to generalize and paint everyone with the same broad strokes. That said, I&#x27;ve lived in three other Asian countries prior to coming to Vietnam, but the attitude and behavior of the foreigners in online communities here are the worst I&#x27;ve seen, particularly on reddit and especially above all on Facebook, at least in the Ho Chi Minh City online communities.
  
If you dare to mention one single thing you dislike about Vietnam (not even mentioning the many other things you DO like - and even if you do, you might get the following treatment) you get shouted at by other foreigners immediately telling you to just go home and calling you an entitled, colonizing, crybaby Westerner. Often these will be the most liked replies, particularly on Facebook.
 
I&#x27;ve seen foreigners in online communities seriously defend things like littering, disobeying of traffic laws (Vietnam has a rather high rate of traffic fatalities), loud street karaoke at midnight, cutting in line, and other such things as just &quot;cultural relativism&quot; (as though littering isn&#x27;t objectively bad for the environment - people ok reddit were honestly defending littering), often with a healthy dose of whataboutism and telling the person to go home. Again, these will often be the most liked replies.
 
I&#x27;ve seen people posting on online communities asking about problems(ex: &quot;is it a problem when I&#x27;ve seen multiple cockroaches in my apartment in one week&quot;) or simple questions like &quot;is the rain in October THAT bad?&quot; only to get bluntly called an idiot and mistreated. 
 
 As said, I&#x27;ve lived in three other Asian countries and participated in their online communities, and the foreigners in Vietnam are seriously the worst I&#x27;ve seen on their discourse. Even the weebs in Japanese communities, who are quite the sight at times, are less toxic and that is really saying something.
 So, why is this such a problem? What&#x27;s happened that has resulted in such toxic online communities here?

                              <span>Hey all. 
 Iâm considering a move (for 1-2 years) or at the very least some longer term travel to Vietnam in the next few years but the only thing holding me back is that I take medication that is restricted in Vietnam. I know that there are many restricted medications available without a script in some pharmacies but I really canât afford to be without them and would love to know if there is a safe and more legit way to do this. 
 Iâm a little unsure about being able to access them and am worried it will impact my ability to stay for longer than 30-60 days at a time. I have prescriptions from home and while the law stipulates that I am only allowed to bring 7 days worth of this medication into the country/m- though I havenât had issues with this previously. Is it as easy as going to a doctor (or psychiatrist?) with a letter from my doctor and list of prescribed medications and diagnosis? 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi All! My wife and my parents are visiting Vietnam in 1 week. I have some prescription pain relief for athritis and shoulder injuries. It&#x27;s nothing too heavy, My doctor has written me a letter. We are in Vietnam for a month and I may not have enough. If I need to get more would the letter and packaging be enough or would I need a doctors prescription?
 Thanks for your help! Cant wait to visit
 P.S if u have any info that will help us let me know, e.g weather, pricing on things atm, things to see/do.
 Haven&#x27;t been since 2016.

                              <span>Currently a solo female traveling through Vietnam and having a great time.
 However, I got into my grab to go to my new hotel and during the ride, I saw him take a picture of my destination with my name and it looked like he sent it to a chat. I am very worried now.
 It could be that he was asking someone where the hotel was. When he first looked at the address, he looked confused, so Iâm hoping itâs something as innocent as that.
 As of now, Iâm in my room with the door locked and wondering if thereâs anything I should do or if I should still be worried.
 I want to know if anyone has experienced this before and what would be the best course of action. 
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I was talking to a dietician.
 I cannot tolerate diary. So I cannot consume milk, cheese, etc. So I need to eat something else that is a good source of calcium. 
 I told her I buy tofu and soy milk at the markets where we see vendors sell raw fruits, veggies, etc. I told her that there is no labels. She asked me whether the soy milk is fortified. She told me that the tofu and the soy milk might not have calcium as we do not know how they are prepared. 
 My questions are: 
  
How is the tofu and soy milk prepared here? 
 Is the soy milk fortified? 
 Does the tofu and the soy milk at the markets have calcium?

                              <span>Hello, guys. I am finishing my undergraduate thesis and the main theme is about American Cinema during VietNam War. I am studying how the American Cinema creates stereotypes and misjudges vietnamise culture by making bad/unreal representations of VietNam. Although, I am not vietnamese and I&#x27;m having lots of problems in identifying the cultural aspects that are bad represented, like clothes, accents and other specific things as well. 
 Is there any vietnamese cinephile that already watched American movies in this subreddit? I&#x27;d like to make some questions!!
 At the same time, books, articles and everything else that could help me dive into the VietNam culture or the American War in Vietnamese perspective would be nice to know. Any recommendations?
 Edit: The movies I am studying are: Green-Berets (1968), The Deer Hunter (1978), Apocalypse Now (1979), Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987), Good Morning Vietnam (1988), Casualties of War (1989).

                              <span>I just finished my trip to Sapa, and man is it beautiful! During my stay, I went on a trek led by a Hmong woman, and she shared some tips about how to support the local minority groups when traveling in this region. Here are the highlights:
  
Do your research when booking trekking expeditions. Most Sapa trekking companies are run by Vietnamese agencies that pay the local guides just a couple of dollars a day. We trekked with Sapa Sisters, which is owned and operated by Hmong women. The guides that lead Sapa Sisters treks receive half the profits from their treks as well as health insurance and paid maternal leave. Our guide said her dream is for everyone to get to work for Sapa Sisters, but for that to happen, they need more business. 
 
Almost all hotels and hostels in Sapa town are owned by Vietnamese companies. To support the locals, consider staying at a homestay in one of the nearby villages. These are often run by families from one of the nearby minority groups. It is super easy to catch a taxi or motorbike to get to these homestays, and they really appreciate the business. Plus, the views and food are better further out from the city!
 
Try to buy souvenirs directly from locals. The stuff in established shops in town is probably not handmade, anyways. 
 
 Safe travels!

                              <span>I recently had to move out of company accomodation in HCM city and need to find a new apartment before the next school year. What is the best way to find a place in the D10/ Govap/ D12 side of town? Most of the places I&#x27;ve seen advertised are in D1/2/3 and that&#x27;s miles away from my work.

                              <span>As the title says I&#x27;m the brother of the soon to be wife and they will be having two wedding ceremonies. One here in the United States, and the other out in Vietnam (don&#x27;t know where exactly yet). What should I expect as someone outside of the culture and who wants to be there for my sister? 
 Obviously have no intentions of harassing or causing any discomfort to the locals to the best of my ability. I&#x27;m just here to support her and her soon to be husband....so obviously don&#x27;t want to offend his family in some way. 
 Also was not sure on which flair for this exactly. Sorry for any confusion.

                              <span>Currently in Ninh binh and planned for next stop to be sapa. However prices on the weekend are very high plus I am sure it is way busier with tourists. Wondering if there is somewhere interesting to go besides Hanoi(already spent 3 nights there) that is in between the two as this would also cut down on 8 hour bus ride

                              <span>Iâm an Australian who has traveled to Vietnam many times and I absolutely love Vietnamese food, culture, beautiful landscapes and cities - but most of all I love the kindness and friendliness of the people. I work in the health sector and I see how significantly drugs and alcohol impact high volumes of people in my own country. Whilst travelling in Vietnam I found myself wondering: is drug use and abuse common in Vietnam? For example do college kids experiment with marijuana or try ecstasy at clubs? Are there heroin/meth addicts? I just feel as though I never saw anyone drug affected in all my time in Vietnam! Genuinely curious. Thank you!

                              <span>I came across this photo from the Vietnam vs. USA women&#x27;s World Cup match the other day
 Vietnam, ranked 32nd, making history with their first ever appearance in a World Cup. Facing world #1 and the back-to-back World Cup champions. The USA.
 Let&#x27;s be honest, Vietnam was expected to get their butts kicked by the US. The 13-0 thrashing of Thailand in the 2019 World Cup wasn&#x27;t out of the question.
 What ended as a 3-0 win by the US where Vietnam played very strong defensively, disrupted the US from many opportunities, and the goalkeeper also saved a penalty kick which was an awesome moment to watch.
 The joy on the face of the goalkeeper in this photo, and also the respect in the style of handshake she is offering the opponent after the loss. Something about this photo is just awesome. 
 The faces of both Vietnamese players. Knowing they went up against the world #1. And although they didn&#x27;t do the completely unexpected and pull out a victory. They did do the unexpected as they managed to keep the score very manageable and respectable. That locker room after the match probably felt like a victory party. There was not much to be disappointed about after that match.
 I hope to see them do well in their upcoming matches. A goal would be an awesome moment for Vietnam. Good luck ladies

                              <span>Hi all. I live in the US and am planning on traveling to Vietnam in September.
 Planning on Hanoi and looking for some advice. I&#x27;m in my late 40s and considering retiring and moving to Vietnam, but that won&#x27;t be determined until I visit and get a feel for the country and life. Firstly, is that possible? I&#x27;d read that while foreigners can&#x27;t own property, they can lease for 50 years which is fine by me, but as far as obtaining a visa that would allow me to stay indefinitely, is that possible? What would be the order in which to do things (visa/apartment purchase/etc.) if I fall in love with the country? Also, anything I should know on bisiting or any common scams to keep a lookout for? I&#x27;m not looking for companionship, so those particular scams won&#x27;t apply

                              <span>They are everywhere!! But the most annoying part is when they come into my house! In 3 days time I have already seen 2 giant rats running around! 
 But they are smartâ¦ Glue traps, they wonât fall for it.. Metal cagesâ¦ they wonât go inâ¦ They are probably not desperate enough to risk their life for the food I put in the traps..
 I have made eyecontact with several of these creatures and actually have some sympathy for them. I really donât want to kill themâ¦ but they are just everywhere!!!! 
 Is there a way to prevent rats coming inside a house? 
 Btw, I never leave food outside.

                              <span>I am not from Vietnam but Iâve lived here for over 7 years and I have Vietnamese family.
 I mean no offense! But why is Vietnamese driving so bad and why does no body care? During covid there was a massive overreaction and national unity to be safe. The highest death rate in Vietnam is due to roadside accidents. Way more deaths than by Covid. So why do people continue to drive so badly? I see people FaceTiming, eating Banh Mi, driving into people, running red lights, the list goes on. I have also unfortunately seen many people dead on the road due crashes. 
 Will this ever change? Why donât people take driving as seriously as they did Covid?

                              <span>The last few days have seen an explosion of posts about r/place. It seems people are treating the drawings there as some sort of national pride&#x27;s symbols and if anything happens to them, the whole country is profoundly humiliated.
 Though a nationalist myself, I find these activities utter nonsense. I really do hope people would use their time more wisely to do something useful instead of looking for some cheap internet pride.

 Per the below really only need a zipper be brought back into the zipline so I assume a shoe repair service could do that to?
 Im in D4 but willing to travel a reasonable amount.

                              <span>I (19M, US Citizen) am interested in moving to Vietnam for about a year or two (I am a freelance artist, and that&#x27;s what I plan to do while I&#x27;m there). I want to move to Northern LÃ o Cai in a studio somewhere in a city where I can retain most of my standard of living. It&#x27;s right next to China which would make border runs every 90 days very easy (With China&#x27;s 10-year multi-entry visa.) 
 I was doing some research for it but I just couldn&#x27;t find the answers to the questions I had. 
  
Is LÃ o Cai more rural or urban?
 Why can&#x27;t I find any studios for rent there? (Maybe I haven&#x27;t looked hard enough, but every search just shows places in Ho Chi Minh)
 Is LÃ o Cai relatively safe?
 Rough monthly Cost of living (I am extremely frugal and willing to make sacrifices to get by if need be, I really only need water, safe housing, and internet/phone services for my work)
  
Thank you in advance for the help, I don&#x27;t speak a lick of Vietnamese yet so it was difficult to translate through all the websites and still find nothing.

                              <span>My partner loves vietamese dramas but doesn&#x27;t watch them much since coming to my country as she doesn&#x27;t really watch them alone and used to view with her mither. I&#x27;m not a big drama show person, but, I think it would make her really happy to watch them with her so I&#x27;d like to try them out. Also, I&#x27;m sure once I start watching they&#x27;d grow on me quite a bit. 
 Does anyone know of any sites that provide English subs? I&#x27;ve found one I think but it ends up being very selective on what show, movie, or episode has the subs.

                              <span>I recently came across some Messages between my bf and his sister in law, they were talking in Vietnamese although Iâm not fluent I can make out a few words, they continuously call each other em yieu and Anh yieu. I know yieu means love. When I asked him about it he said that itâs normal to bwteen sisters and brothers to say that to each other , but Iâve never heard him call his own biological sisters by that kind of name . I just want to know is this appropriate or normal in Vietnam tradition to call brother in laws and sister in laws Anh yieu and em yieu?

                              <span>This r/place event shows how poor Vietnam&#x27;s internet culture is when many Vietnamese first use a global, mixed-country social network. Most Vietnamese people only use Facebook or TikTok to chat with fellow countrymen in their community. So, like fish in a pond going to sea, some embarrassing aspects can be seen:
 Weird nationalism is most evident when a propaganda poster is the first choice of art to show Reddit about our country. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with wanting to show sovereignty, but this event isn&#x27;t the place to do it. So among various creative artworks, the propaganda poster appears very out of place. We could&#x27;ve drawn cultures, buildings, or famous people instead. If you use Facebook a lot, you can also see for yourself how obsessed Vietnamese are with nationalism.
 Facebook doesn&#x27;t have a clear upvote and downvote system like Reddit, so many Vietnamese people who only use Facebook have the habit of commenting mindlessly in their own way and get downvoted straight away as a result when they comment on Reddit. That illustrates how poor their reasoning and chatting skills are.
 Vietnamese Facebookers and tiktokers tend to follow the crowd and blame others. When the Vietnamese artwork expanded, there were thousands of copy-paste comments with empty apologies and blaming an unknown third party. But without doing anything to fix it, the affected communities have to do it themselves. They only care to save their faces to feel good while doing nothing.
 As a Vietnamese person myself, I used to use Facebook a lot in the past, but nowadays I barely use it because of the terrible internet culture in Vietnam. After finding out about Reddit, I find it a much better social media platform for entertainment and discussion. Engaging in Vietnamese Facebook posts is just really frustrating to me.

                              <span>Hi guys I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right sub to ask this qn, if it&#x27;s not pls direct me to the correct one ð.
 So I&#x27;m a JC student from Singapore and towards the end of the year a grp of us are going to visit several orphanages in Ho Chi Minh to entertain the children there as part of a school organised trip. We have come up with several activities to accommodate the kids as many of them have either physical or mental disabilities.
 One of the ideas that I proposed which got the go ahead was to play some songs on the recorder for the kids. I heard that music can be very engaging towards those that have mental disabilities. Some advice that I received was to pick songs that would be familiar to the kids so that they could enjoy it.
 So is there any song recommendations that the kids would know? Vietnamese nursery rhymes? Anything along that vein? Although I do have a musical background I have not touched the recorder in quite a while. So songs that might be too complicated would be a no go HAHA.
 Anyways thanks for reading, have a great day!

                              <span>Long story short, Iâm going to be meeting my biological family for the first time in-person in a few months. I am from the US. What would be good gifts for when I meet them? If it helps, I am from New York so thereâs the possibility of bringing cool things from NYC. 
 I want to get something for my birth mom, brother, his wife, and their two young children.

                              <span>While most was watching Messi&#x27;s first game in the US. I was ecstatic about US vs VN. The game was better than expected only because I thought US was going to cut through VN like butter. Although offense and counter attack was so so defense was great and to block a penalty kick by Alex Morgan. Miss T. T. Kim Thanh is the MVP in my book for that. Needless to say USA might struggle for the 3 peat.

                              <span>Some kind hearted people decided to burn their mattresses and other rubbish right next to the English center I work at. I understand it&#x27;s the country side and it&#x27;s common to burn trash. But why right next to the school. The whole road is empty , yet they choose to burn next to the school and fill the rooms with toxic plastic smoke. It&#x27;s disgusting and terrible for all the children and adults health.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve observed that Vietnamese individuals rarely engage in serious academic or scientific discussions on Facebook. Content channels that focus on science are carefully curated, making it challenging for them to become popular. Instead, groups that boast about achievements, offer humor, or criticize celebrities tend to gain significant traction. This has always piqued my curiosity, as finding groups that genuinely provide valuable knowledge is a rarity. If you happen to know any such groups, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it if you could share their names and information!
 Regarding the group I&#x27;m currently enjoying, it can be found at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/vietnambinhan.

What can I bring as gift for the wedding (food, clothe,...)? Physical gift or money, as I know in china they give an envelop of money, does this rules apply in vietnam also? What should be the amount?

                              <span>I think this is the problem that some of us are facing when having typical Asian parents. The relationship between me (26) and my mom (65 years old) is really bad that we didnât have a proper conversation for 10 years (+). It&#x27;s not that she did anything wrong, it&#x27;s just the age gap between us that makes us hard to understand each other. And the things she thoughts were good for me made me felt uncomfortable and pushed me further away from her. I wouldnât go in details but I think we all understand what they are.
 I left the country when I was 16 years old and leave far away from her since then. But because of that reason, our relationship is getting better. I only came to visit once before Covid. And that visit turned out terrible. As soon as we spoke to each other, we fight. I then came to the conclusion that as long as I kept a safe distance from her, our relationship will be improved.
 I can tell that she is trying to fix our relationship in recent years. Every time she called me, she really tried to not say anything wrong or to upset me. The things she did wrong that hurt me, she no longer does. It&#x27;s just the negative feelings toward her that already haunted me.
 I wanted to try, but the idea of speaking to her itself made me feel uncomfortable, not to mention the long quiet between us. 
 In the last couple of years, I don&#x27;t really find myself trying to improve the relationship anymore. I am happy without speaking to her, although I still endear her a lot. To make up for my neglect, I take care of her by sending money back to Vietnam. I understand that it&#x27;s not enough. And as her child, I need to do more for her.
 But she is getting older, I know that any conversation I have with her could be the last one. I am too scared of the idea that I will regret not taking action sooner one day. However, I donât know how to fix this and where to start with. My Vietnamese fellow, if you were in the same situation, could you give me some suggestions?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Iâm just a foreigner who is living in Vietnam, but I feel I have a right to bring this up, probably brought up many times. 
 But this is without a doubt one of the most beautiful places in the world, but it is disgusting to see people throw trash on the ground, even trash covering the roads in rural areas, I am en route to Nha Trang by bus and our driver just pulled over outside someoneâs home in the Minh province, throw three iced coffee cups out the door, got out to have a smoke and threw the butt towards the homes driveway. 
 Serious questionable mentality with some people here. Need to start treasuring this amazing country they have and not treat it as a landfill. My Vietnamese girlfriend along with our mutual Vietnamese friends, all in our mid 20âs to early 30âs are disgusted by it also. Shit behaviour

                              <span>First and for most thank you for reading this,
 For context, I moved to California when I was in 4th grade. I&#x27;ve studied in America for almost 10 years. I&#x27;ve struggled and pulled through a lot, and I&#x27;ve been accepted to a very well-known university (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) in California for engineering (highly recruited and famous among all tech companies). 
 My options were: UCSB, UCD, Cal Poly, and UCI. I chose Cal Poly. 
 I can stay in America and make a lot of money, but my parents are getting old and I planned to live near them. I can write and speak in both Vietnamese and English, but I prefer English as my main language (writing in Vietnamese can be a struggle). 
 Since, I have lived in America for so long, I&#x27;m not familiar with the job prospect in Vietnam. I hope to work for a foreign company in Vietnam that pay me well for my prestigious foreign degree and skills.
 Therefore, I need advice on what kind of engineering or degree would yield me the most job prospect in Vietnam. 
 Options: Computer Engineering, Data Science &amp; Statistics, Mechanical Engineering, or Business 
 Any insights or combinations of degrees that would optimize my salary would be greatly appreciated. Any kind of experience or companies that I can focus to break into? 
 I plan on getting an MS degree also.
 Please give me a reasonable salary range that I can expect to work in Vietnam for a foreign company.
 My parents live in HCM City. 
 If you spend time reading all of this to understand my situation, I hope you know that I greatly appreciate your time. I consider Vietnam my hometown, and a place that I love. Thank you so much!

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m currently on a mission to find the perfect spot for a special life event - proposing to my girlfriend of six years. We are going to travel to Vietnam in the middle of September, and we will start our trip in the north around Sa Pa. Then, we will probably continue gradually to the south.
 I don&#x27;t think I will be able to keep this secret for so long, so I&#x27;m searching for a good, quiet, and romantic place, probably in the north of Vietnam. However, if there is something worth considering in the South, I will be open to it :)
 I would really appreciate your personal recommendations for a romantic location.
 Thanks in advance!

I say one place as it will be difficult to travel much (plane etc) between work commitments. Any advice appreciated!

                              <span>So I recently went and got IV fluids and an antibiotic along with a 5 day antibiotics prescription, it came to 2,700,000 dong! I was a bit shocked considering it&#x27;s Vietnam? Is this normal or was I scammed. It wasn&#x27;t in a hospital it was in a pharmacy, not to mention it was cash only! I&#x27;ve no proof except their own written prescription for insurance to claim it back

                              <span>My mother was born and raised in Saigon and fled after the war to America. I&#x27;m American born and don&#x27;t really speak Viet. Growing up, I remember tons of &quot;us vs. them&quot; stories and how the sound of northern accent can instantly put them (moms family) into an angry and aggressive mode. I never really gave it much thought because I&#x27;m American. I&#x27;ve only visited Vietnam twice years ago.
 Anyways I&#x27;ve lived in Japan for a few years and met a girl from Hanoi. I&#x27;ve never dated a Vietnamese girl before and honestly never thought I would. Conversation wise and personality wise, I think we get along quite well. It&#x27;s funny because we have to communicate in Japanese, which is neither of our mother tongues. I&#x27;m now more motivated to improve my Vietnamese, and her English is making good progress too.
 We aren&#x27;t dating officially, but both of us are definitely interested in next steps. We are both 30+ so I think we both recognize the need for discretion and caution, to respect each other&#x27;s time, feelings, and limitations. I need to be in America for the time being so it would be long distance. 
 My main concern is regarding potential culture clashes with her being from the north. I hate to say it but my family is so judgmental and can be blindly toxic. Im really worried how my mom would react. I know it&#x27;s illogical and kinda racist behavior so before people attack my mother, please understand that she comes from war torn Vietnam and we have lost numerous family members during the war. They have serious trauma associated with the northern accent, and I would like to hear what others think and how their experiences have fared.
 Any thoughts, advice or discussion is welcome. Thank you for sharing your experiences and keeping it civil.

                              <span>It is said that after China was conquered by the Manchus, they were polluted by the barbarian culture. Many Sinosphere nations wanted to invade the Qing Dynasty and restore China. It is said that Gia Long planned an invasion, which never came to fruition. 
 However, Vietnamese clothing showed signs of evolving to be more like the Manchu Qizhuang in the late-19th century for some reason.
 Before that, Vietnamese clothes were more flowy like Chinese and Korean ones. Japanese ones werenât so flowy but they didnât look like Manchu ones.
 Why?

Rushed back to my hotel and downed a hydration pack. Is this normal? Does the body adjust? Everyone else at the gym had the normal amount of sweat. I didnât even lift heavy!

                              <span>I love coffee in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve lived in Vietnam for 8 years now and coffee is 20â of the reason for that. I&#x27;m married and my wife and I have a daughter. 
 We&#x27;ve travelled a lot and stayed at a lot of different hotels and resorts. One thing my wife and I have always noticed, the coffee at these resorts is terrible. 
 How can a resort that charges 1.7 mill a night make worse coffee than Ca Phe 123 I can find down some random street who only charges 25k? 
 My wife says it&#x27;s becuase the resort wants to make it for western customers, but a place like Vin Pearl has 90â Vietnamese guests. 
 Like, go to any cafe with plastic tables and chairs and I would bet money their coffee will be better than a 5 star resort. What&#x27;s up with that?

                              <span>The current game of Vietnam vs the USA has all the makings of a possible upset. I have not heard much hype from my Vietnamese friends and coworkers. Sadly they seemed more excited about Messi debuting for Miami. I would hope that there are world cup viewings setup in Ho Chi Minh and other major cities; to show support for these women.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an American expat in Taiwan but my wife is Vietnamese hence why I lurk on this sub. I noticed that there seem to be a lot of salty redditors on this sub who seem to think that all white expats in Vietnam are sex tourists, and dating the locals is an expression of &quot;attempting to quench their thirst for submissive Asian girls&quot;. Pretty much every post here where an expat gets scammed by a bar girl has at least one or two redditors celebrating their misfortune.
 I don&#x27;t see this attitude nearly so much in Taiwan. Nobody seems to have much of a problem with expats dating and marrying locals, and I seldom here any accusations of less than honorable motivations for doing so. 
 Is it that Vietnam attracts a particularly unsavory variety of expat? Are Vietnamese men more xenophobic than their Taiwanese counterparts? Is this particular subreddit just a little bit more toxic than it&#x27;s Taiwanese counterpart? 
 Partially curious just for shits and giggles, but also trying to get a feel for what living in Vietnam would be like and the attitudes of locals towards expats in case the misses and I ever decide to relocate there.

Just ordered one large gin and tonic. Out 30 USD but could have been worse. Never ran into this situation in other countries but seems extremely common in hanoi. 
 Oh well. Live and learn.

 My background: born and raised in Vietnam, studied and worked in the UK for 11 years. I&#x27;m planning to go back to Vietnam in near future and being super irritated at the quality of media being fed to the general public as a whole, especially younger generation in the country.
 Being out of the country for so long, I must confess of being completely out of touch with the media development in the last decade. To be fair, during my childhood in Vietnam from 2006 to 2012, I was much more inclined to consume western media like TV series and movies on HBO, Cinemax, Discovery Channels and listened to western music on MTV despite not understanding a word and have to use subtitle most of the time.

                              <span>One thing I find peculiar, from what I&#x27;ve been told, whether foreigner or citizen, all properties require a 30% upfront down payment in order to qualify for or be approved for a loan from a financial institution? Is this correct? Not yet in the process of buying but considering it among other options in VN and in the region. Can anyone share personal experiences of buying as a foreigner or married to VN partner? I understand that VN is a fast growing economy and the housing market is rapidly changing and have also heard many opinions on whether it is a financially sound decision in regards to the current and projected state of the market and quality of purchased unit. Can anyone share a personal experience?

                              <span>Looking to hire a Saigon lawyer to navigate the court system.
 Any advice or recommendation for a lawyer dealing with property dispute?
 How fair/corrupt is the court system?
 Is it common in VN, for a lawyer to work for opposing sides?
 Do lawyer takes money/favors from both sides?
 Is it also common for judges accept bribery?
 Any experience would be useful.

                              <span>Hello! So recently I went to HCMC. The food and the places were amazing, but the one thing I canât get out of my mind are the dogs around the city. At first I just saw one dog of a particular breed which is supposed to be âregular-sizedâ and thought that mustâve been a mixed dog. However, the more I explored the city, the more dogs I saw that had short and stubby legs (they are all different breeds btw). I even went on a Mekong delta tour and even the dogs on the island we went to were stubby as well. Can someone explain this to me or is it all just a coincidence? Iâm genuinely curious about this as Iâve thought about it for a good amount of time on the flight home lol.
  
I read somewhere that theyâre tiny mainly to fit them in smaller apartments/housing around the city. But why not get dogs of a small breed to begin with? 
 
A local humored us by saying that dogs are smaller so that they can be eaten easily (pls donât be true T_T)

                              <span>Hi, probably not the best place to ask (already booked a doctors appointment to talk to a GP). 
 2-3 weeks ago I was travelling in Vietnam and went to the Cu Chi tunnels. There was a couple bats in there. While going through one the tunnels a bat flew at me, bounced off my torso and flew away. The contact was very brief and I didnât feel like it scratched/bit me but after seeing some fearmongering tiktoks (haha cringe I know) they were saying you should get a rabies vaccine/immunoglobulin even if it didnât bite you as the bites can go unnoticed due to their small size. Itâs been 17 days since the bat flew into me. 
 Should I be worried? Is lyssavirus common for bats in the area or have their been many cases? Tried to find some vietnam specific info but no luck. I know in Australia (where I am from and where I am now) that contact with bats is typically treated for rabies. 
 Will definitely take the advice of the GP once weâve talked but just wanted to know if any of you guys have had similar experiences or any knowledge.

                              <span>I live in US and plan to travel to Vietnam with family in August, flying into Hanoi. First time visiting Vietnam. I saw a post about getting money exchanged at jewelry shops, and all ATMs charge crazy fees. So, wondering if I need to get some VND in US before I fly over since it might take some time for me to find a jewelry store. Or perhaps I can use USD if I can&#x27;t find a jewelry shop?

 What are the current rules and what does the most people do? I plan to be in cities and on country sites.
 I will bring spear masks for the pollution, but the question is, if it is also necessary for COVID.

Is it free or low cost? Do I need to be insured etc? Any insight helps truly, thank you!

Anyone that can help me out with potential places that are knowingly open for conversation and meeting people (Ho Chi Minh City).

                              <span>Wife and I are in our 60âs. We are planning on being in Vietnam next march. My wife has fallen in love with the scenery in ha giang. I know my wife will not get on a motorcycle and is not great with heights. Is there any other way for us to enjoy this area without scaring her to death :).
 Thanks for your helpâ¦

                              <span>I saw some videos about some of the darkest place in the US, where the night sky looks much much better duo to no light pollution. Which made me wonder if thereâs a similar location in Vietnam

Hey r/vietnam homies! The epic pixel art battle of r/place is returning in 2023. Let&#x27;s represent Vietnam with some sick pixel art!
 For better teamwork, we have two discord servers that you can join: 
  
The official r/vietnam discord server at https://discord.gg/HRvPMnKzBA
 
The Vietnamese r/place community server at https://discord.gg/r-placevietnam-960076480916901948. It&#x27;s specifically for r/place but just remember it&#x27;s not run by the r/vietnam mods.
 
 Let&#x27;s have fun and make friends with all the communities. And of course, don&#x27;t forget to occasionally touch grass and stay hydrated when placing those pixels ;)
 See you on the canvas, you creative geniuses!
 And please don&#x27;t flood the sub with new r/place posts. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 In May this year I spent about a week in Da Nang and I really enjoyed my stay there.
 I am planning to do another Vietnam trip soon and want to know if there are any good (multi-day)hikes in/around Da Nang?
 Thanks!
