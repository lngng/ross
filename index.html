                              <span>Hey! ;)
 My Vietnamese fiancée and me (from Germany) will celebrate our wedding in Đà Nẵng next year in early September. We are looking for a band who can perform both Vietnamese songs and English rock/alternative/pop music. We are planning a wedding that will combine both Vietnamese and &quot;Western&quot; traditions - and, of course, our own wishes and visions. 
 We expect around a hundred guests. Most guests will be from Vietnam, but many people from Germany and other nations from around the world will hopefully join. So, it will be wonderful to have people from all over the world to come together, celebrate and connect with one another. We hope a band will be able to play a set before dinner and one afterwards. So, maybe around 3-4 hours in total. Afterwards, we will have a DJ put on some music and we invite the band members to join and celebrate with us. 
 If you or someone you know might be interested, please message me! ;) Looking forward to hear from you!
 All best
 Niko

                              <span>I&#x27;m into listening(podcasts)/watching(YouTube)/reading about murder mysteries/unsolved cases/crime stories. I am Viet Kieu and can understand and speak Vietnamese. I am trying to learn to read/write in Vietnamese. Out of all the stories that I&#x27;ve heard about, it&#x27;s very rare that I hear a story from Vietnam. A few months ago, I heard about Dung Hà (Vietnamese female gangster) and found her story quite fascinating. I was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction (YouTube, podcast, websites, books) where I can learn more stories such as this? I&#x27;d really appreciate it!

                              <span>Hey!
 I’m an American born Vietnamese who would like to re-learn the language after 20 some odd years of not being fluent.
 My mom re-married after immigrating to America and our household was fully English speaking from the time I was 9 so it sort of fell to the wayside.
 I can listen and comprehend okay (still pretty bad) but my speaking is garbage to put it lightly.
 I’ve tried using duo lingo but I think the dialect is mostly northern whereas my family and friends are from the south so that’s what I would like to focus my learning around.
 Of course I can always speak to my mom now but she’s not really equipped to “teach” it so to speak.
 What are some good resources online? Is it worth it to find a private tutor? I know a few viet friends who learned/perfected their English by watching tv, can the same be said about consuming Vietnamese media with English subtitles? Is that even a thing?
 I think my biggest hurdle is embarrassment/awkwardness when it comes to talking, I lose confidence and don’t want to sound like an idiot so it’s hard to stay consistent.
 Any ideas?

 ​
 Is it worth staying in Can Tho for 2 nights, or since we really only have like 1.5 days in HCMC, we should skip staying in Can Tho and just take a day trip?

                              <span>Hello! Sorry if this is more suited for the sticky thread, but its quite specific.
 I was adopted from Hanoi in 1992 and I am currently visiting Vietnam and Hanoi.
 I wanted to show the adoption clinic to my children but neither me nor my parents remember the address(we visited the facility in 2008/2009). I am aware that we need permission to enter the facility but we only want to see the outside.
 The only information I have is that the clinic was called &quot;B clinic&quot; or &quot;Clinic B&quot; back in 1992 and I believe it was still in operation in 2008/2009. However the name can have changed. 
 Any information is of value as we leave Hanoi on the 23rd of December and only have tomorrow to find and visit the facility.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Might not be a Vietnam first but it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve personally seen a western family of 4 on a Honda wave in vn.
 Man, woman, 2 small children. Can&#x27;t recall if the children were helmeted... But left me feeling it&#x27;s a new milestone.... Rather than Migrant workers coming to vn on their own or possibly in pairs, Migrant families living daily life in the city. It felt real off.

                              <span>am at the beggining of a motorcycle trip starting in HCMC and aiming to travel in the length of country. I&#x27;ve loved my time here so far and looking forward to the rest of the trip!
 I bought a motorbike in HCMC, a Yamaha T135, which has served me well the first week. However I obviously wasn&#x27;t thorough enough when inspecting it since I&#x27;ve only just realised the indicators are not orange but blue! I&#x27;m pretty sure its the bulbs themselves since the light housing is clear plastic. 
 My question to those in the know - is this illegal? Will I get pulled over by police as I travel from HCMC to Hanoi/Hai Gaing loop?
 I haven&#x27;t seen any other bikes with coloured indicators so far so a bit worried to be honest

I&#x27;m looking to purchase a Honda Winner X 2022 V3 (Red Color/Special Edition/ABS) in Hanoi, and I&#x27;ve heard second-hand might be the way to go. Any recommendations for trustworthy retailers in the city? Also, any advice on what to look out for and the legal procedures for a foreigner to acquire a motorbike in Vietnam? Considering having my Vietnamese wife buy it – thoughts on that? Appreciate all your insights! 🙌

                              <span>I went to Vietnam summer 2023, and saying that I miss it is an understatement. I’m vietnamese but I was born and raised in California. As you can tell, these two places are.. EXTREMELY different. So.. to those who are Vietnamese but don’t live there.. What are some things you guys do that reminds you of Vietnam? Certain activities, places.. Etc..

 Are both usage of “tìm” correct? First screenshot accepts tìm but second doesn’t allow. When should I use “tìm thấy” vs “tìm”?
 Please also explain giúp versus giúp đỡ. Reason is one lesson I Learn it didnt allow me to use giúp đỡ tôi and corrected me with giúp tôi. Why is that? Does đỡ modified the word giúp? 
 Thanks. Cảm ơn.

                              <span>My coworker is an older gentleman who fought in Vietnam. He keeps a lot of pictures and memorabilia of his time there. He’s not sure where this picture came from, its relation to the Vietnam war, or if it was even taken in Vietnam. We couldn’t find anyone who knew how to translate it as most Asian Americans we asked said it wasn’t their language and even if it was they don’t read only speak. We think it’s written in Vietnamese but someone told us it was Chinese. Any ideas?

 They don&#x27;t tell you at check-in either, just with security officers at the boarding gate. So if you&#x27;ve purchased liquids in the terminal they will confiscate them.
 If you ever have the chance, please let them know that they are full of shit, because we just checked with Australian Biosecurity here and they have confirmed that policy is an airline policy even though when you are boarding the plane they claim it is an Australian policy.
 Probably just trying to force you to purchase their cash only in-flight beverages.
 F*** VietJet.
 Edit: To be absolutely clear, we are talking about an additional restriction at the boarding gate, not the normal security check where we all know liquids must be surrendered. This applies to all liquids purchased in the terminal after security screening.

                              <span>Hello. I’m coming out to South East Asia the end of January and was wondering how much Ha Giang gets effected by the burning season. My plan was to do Thailand first(chiang mai before burning season) and then hit Vietnam in late February/march. Now I’m worried Ha Giang(what I want to do most) will be low visibility due to the smoke. Is February/March a bad time to do Ha Giang with visibility?

I was quite surprised by her views on relationship and marriage and so I was wondering if she is a successful/known/famous author in Vietnam.
 Moreover, if you have good Vietnamese authors to recommend to me do not hesitate!

                              <span>Took the bike over from Nha Trang today to check out what looked like a cool stretch of coastline. I could see from Google maps that there was a load of resorts along the stretch of beach by Cam Ranh airport, but it just seemed so surreal driving around there! Surely none of them are ever anywhere near capacity? We saw nobody around apart from workers who were mostly just chilling out outside of the gated resorts. Are they laundering projects? The upkeep must be so expensive. Does anyone know what it was like on this stretch of beach before they were all built? Just curious!

                              <span>Hi, I didnt know where to post his but I hope I can get some answers.
 I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. I have read multiple places that Phu Quoc is overdeveloped and does not give you that &quot;island life&quot; feeling. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
  
Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :) Thank you for all answers!

                              <span>Sorry for the rant. But some of the public colleges and primary-high schools in HCM City keep setting back the GODDAMN TIME in which morning classes start. The old time usually was 7:15 or 7:30am, then it back to 7am, and now it become 6:45am (Some schools like HCMC University of Industry and Trade set to as early as 6:30am)
 When asked about this decision, 2 of the most popular answers from the school speaker are: - To avoid heavy traffic --&gt; They seriously thought &quot;If the traffic is usually jammed at 7am, then why don&#x27;t we just start the school at 6:45am?&quot;. To me, this is such a dangerous one-sided thinking, which disregard students whose houses are very far from school. Doesn&#x27;t even mention student now even have less time for breakfast anymore if they wake up at 6 o&#x27;clock or later. Plus, people who don&#x27;t want to deal with heavy traffic are already aware to get up early, you don&#x27;t need to force everyone has to go more earlier, as long as they go to school before it starts.
  
To prevent student from coming late to class and to encourage them to wake up early--&gt; There is no scientific research stated that the earlier the school start, the lower the student coming to school late. School in US and Europe begin at atleast 8 am so student can have good sleep, which they&#x27;ve done countless researches before. Again, dangerous one-sided thinking to me. As a grad student, I have twice to tripple amount of assignments despite sleeping less comparing to my time in high school. From my experience, it encourages more people to go to class late lol. My friends said this is dumb, and they ended up always going late or only go to second class (8:30 - 10:10am).
  
Sorry if you find this rant and broken English annoying. I&#x27;m 2nd year grad student and I&#x27;m tired of waking up in 5am so that I can take buses in 5:40 to get to school in time. The reason I wrote this post so I can relieve some stress from constant complaining against my school. Hope you forgive me.

                              <span>I&#x27;m 24 and a local here (hcmc, vietnam). I found 2 great friends in real life from this sub reddit and wanna test my luck this time. Also, my roommate/best friend is getting married so I&#x27;m feeling a bit lonely idk 😕 About me: I play games but not so good with it, just average I think (LoL, Valorant, CSGO, DST, overcooked etc.). LGBT+ friendly and open minded (I do know that some ppl do claim that they&#x27;re but they actually dont but this is what ppl around comment about me so I think its reliable 😂). I&#x27;m not so good with recommending cool food places cuz I mostly order food to my house 🥲 Good hidden bars, coffee shops yeah I can do. I read manga and watch anime too but wouldnt say I know many good ones. I draw as a side hobbies, not so much recently but yeah I do love art. Have tattoos, I can recommend some good tattoo artists that I mainly go to here. I have depression, anxiety, bipolar and a bit of adhd (thats a lot isnt it 🤡) but Im highly self aware and well put together most of the time. Last but not least 😂 I&#x27;m a libra.

                              <span>I am a white guy visiting my wife’s family in a pretty rural part of Vietnam. Our sleeper bus stopped on the way and I went in to use the urinal taking the first empty one (there was probably 50 urinals mostly empty). Some guy comes in right after me and takes the urinal right next to me, then proceeds to just stare over the divider at my junk very obviously for a good 20 seconds. It was very obvious since he peaked his entire head over the divider multiple times. Eventually I gave up on peeing and left to use a stall cause I felt too uncomfortable. Any advice on what I should do in that situation? Do you say something or just walk away like I did? Is this common?

                              <span>Sorry if this is not the right place to post this but I just want to get this off my chest to s community like this. For some context I was born in Hanoi and adopted into a US family at 8 months old - I have nothing as far of information regarding my parents, just my birthday and where I was found abandoned. I got the chance to visit Vietnam for the first time in 16 years since I was born last month. I got to experience the city and the wonderful people and I got to go to my orphanage. I got back to the US just 2 weeks ago and I just miss Vietnam so much - part of it just feels like home to me and I just miss the whole vibe and general culture of the country. I have never traveled to a place where I just felt so in place and “normal” with people who were genuinely interested in me and cared about me. It honestly was an experience nice and feeling that I really cannot put into words. I am not normally a person to express my emotions like this but I just had to get it out somehow sorry this was more of a post about my feelings and more about myself 😅. Anyways thanks for reading - sending love ❤️.

                              <span>Arrived at Tan Son Nhat and called a GrabCar to my hotel in District 1 since it was 100k vnd opposed to the 300k-400k vnd quoted by the taxi stands.
 After a few minutes trying to find my driver in the parking lot at the Arrivals exit, he helped load my full size luggage and medium totebag into the trunk while I carried my pet carrier with me into the back seat.
 About 5 minutes into the ride, the driver motions a hand gesture towards his tummy and realize he is trying to say he has a stomach ache and needs to find a restroom en route. He gets on his phone and coordinates with another driver to take me in their car instead. We stop at a gas station, and I get out with my pet carrier and begin to get into the other car. My driver opens the trunk to retrieve my luggage, closes the trunk lid right away and holds up a 100k bill to show me as he hands it to the new driver. I am in agreement as it seems fine with the exchange of funds to the new driver, and I pay the first driver once my ride completes.
 As I am about to enter the new car, I realize I am missing my large totebag. I tell my original driver, hey I&#x27;m missing my other bag. So I go over to the car and he opens the trunk and reaches in and retrieves my totebag. I see the totebag is placed in the trunk in a small, recessed area that just seemed odd. I didn&#x27;t think much of all this at first, but at the end of the day, this incident has kept me thinking I was trying to be robbed. My totebag contained all my essential items.
 tldr: grabcar drivers says he is sick minutes into a ride, gets me a replacement car and driver and forgets to transfer all my luggage to new car.

                              <span>Hi, I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
 Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :)
  
Thank you for all answers!

Bản thân em thì công việc cũng ổn định, có 1 khoản tiết kiệm khoảng 400tr, nuôi 1 bé mèo. Cũng lâu rồi em không yêu đương gì nên thấy độc thân cũng quen. Hồi xưa đi học còn hơi hướng ngoại nhưng giờ cuộc sống chỉ quanh quẩn đi làm rồi về nhà, đi ăn với bạn thân, dần dần em lười bắt đầu một mối quan hệ mới luôn. Cũng không phải là không có ai tán mà thực sự em không có hứng thú luôn ấy ạ (mặc dù e vẫn là gái thẳng). Không biết có chị nào từng giống em mà cưới chồng rồi có thể cho em xin lời khuyên được không ạ? Em cảm ơn.

                              <span>I sorta want to learn to read and write chữ nôm, and that would requite me to learn Chinese. What dialect would I learn? Before the arrival of the Jesuits and French, Vietnamese was written in chữ nôm, which were Chinese characters modified to write Vietnamese. In order to read and write this script, one probably had to have a good understanding of Chinese. But what dialect of Chinese did chữ nôm writers speak? It probably was not Mandarin, as that was spoken in northern China, ~2000 miles away from Vietnam. Chinese rule of Vietnam ended in the 10th century, so there must have been some drift in the Chinese dialect the literate Vietnamese knew and the dialects the Chinese spoke.

 I am a South African who recently got a job offer in Vietnam. I&#x27;ll be leaving later in January. Please advise me on what to carry with me. I want to start buying everything I&#x27;ll need.

 Hi all, does anyone know of a platform similar to instacart in Vietnam? I&#x27;ve heard of shopee (not available to download in the US), Lazara, and tiki but I believe they are similar to Amazon so I&#x27;m not quite sure about quality control (there are reviews of course). For context, I&#x27;m based in the US and would like to get groceries for my relatives in VN once in awhile. TYIA!

I want to start from the end and say that ultimately nothing happened to us, and we continue to enjoy our trip here.
 My partner and I are visiting Vietnam and we are currently in Hanoi. Last evening we were walking around the Hoàn Kiếm area, when at some point a man seemed to have offered us something (I did not hear/understand). I have simply politely responded &quot;no thanks&quot; and my partner and I continued walking. From that point, I could see from the corner of my eye he was walking behind us. We did not interact further. At some point, he passed us and was now ahead of us by a few steps. Whenever we stopped (to look at our map, cons…</span>

 Do you think it&#x27;s impossible in my case to get a job in Vietnam? What about the visa?
 I am a French Software developer with 3 years of experience, both in France and Germany.
 I am fluent in English and French. I know that recruitment policies rightfully prioritize locals, but I would appreciate your opinion about this topic! or even some feedbacks.
 Thanks for your answers :)

I&#x27;m not accusing the entire sub of being these stereotypers as most of the replies are level-headed, but there are still some things I just wanna get off my chest as a non-native who was raised in Vietnam.
  
The accusations of racism.
  
Whilst it is true that Vietnam is a racist country, I find it absolutely ridiculous that people seem to be stereotyping the entire nation as being racists. I myself whilst not exactly dark skinned, have seen a lot of darker skinned Viets living life normally. Matter of fact- a big majority of Viets are tanned, regardless of class.

On the way, we see a bike lying on the side of the road. I immediately stop and see two kids (maybe 17-18) lying there in a puddle of blood. I stop the bike, jump off, and run over to them and notice that one kid has two huge holes in his head and his face is completely covered in blood. The other kid is alright, just a scratch across his face from the pavement, but visibly shocked trying to shake his friend. Some people are standing in the distance just looking, while his head is lying on the side of the road.
 I hold his head up, his blood is pouring all over me. I try to wave to people passing by, and every single person stops, looks, shrugs, and keeps going. Not a sin…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I have tried drugs pretty much from every class. Weed, traditional psychedelics, stimulants, dissociatives and sedatives. I have experience with relatively high dose of shrooms and LSD, also with vaping and smoking DMT. I&#x27;m familiar with the feeling those all share to some extent. I have done high dose of edible cannabis multiple times too.
 Tonight I was alone in a bar in Vietnam and a guy asked me to join their table. I joined them and we enjoyed some beer and tried to have a conversation even though they didn&#x27;t really speak english. They had a shisha on the table and offered it for me and I smoked it few times. It was my first time doing shisha, everything seemed just normal, it tasted like mellow strawberry. Bar staff was taking care of the shisha so I believe it was just an or…</span>

                              <span>I’m currently in Hanoi, and a friend managed to buy a Grab jacket for me as a souvenir during my last trip.
 I know it sounds weird, but I figure other tourists have tshirts (which I do as well), but buying a jacket is unique, and it really reminds me of being in Vietnam.
 My friend is refusing to help me look for a BE jacket this time; he says it’s the “uniform of the poor”.
 So, I’m on my own on this endeavour. How would I buy one, despite not being able to speak Vietnamese?

                              <span>I recently saved $1M USD after working/investing in the US for 8 years and am 29 now. I&#x27;m tired of living in the US as an Asian American with all the violence and crime and unsafe cities here.
 What would life be like in VN with this amount of savings at a relatively young age? Thanks for any advice or perspective.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in vietnam for over 2 weeks now and I&#x27;ve been really depressed about the racism I&#x27;m facing here. To give some context, I&#x27;m chinese and indian, quite dark skinned, female. 
 The counts of racism I&#x27;ve faced here is absolutely disheartening, maybe because of my background, I tend to notice the implicates of it. Other - I&#x27;ve been really well behaved, trying to break the misconceptions about my countrie(s) not because I deliberately want to, but because that&#x27;s how I am. I&#x27;m introverted, am always polite, tip well, do not indulge in the bad stuff. 
  
At the hotel I was in, I saw white tourists get upgraded and also an Asian Australian man get upgraded (their original rooms were not available). In my case I was asked to wait 3 hours for my room, when I asked if I could pay for a better room, they happily obliged. This happened on the same day, around the same time. 
 
Customer service - Specually in hotels again, I saw how other customers were treated over me. Unfortunately, I did notice a theme going around with the skin tone. I saw a couple who came in after me order much more elaborate dishes, it was only after they finished almost eating, was I served my very simple dish. 
 
The cherry on top, I took a tour to a popular tourist guide with a English speaking tour guide, he went on to speak about how brown skin is not considered beautiful in vietnam, that it&#x27;s ugly, relates to poor and bad behavior as he himself was brown, he did not have good experiences in vietnam with his love life, job etc.. this really broke my heart. This country is supposed to have the kindest of people, having read the previous threads too, I didn&#x27;t expect to have this experience in Vietnam of all places. 
 
 I just wanted to share this with all the people of colour who keep asking this question if the vietnamese are racist. Here&#x27;s your answer. Ofcourse, it&#x27;s not as blatant, or direct, but hurtful nonetheless.

                              <span>Hi,
 I wondered if there was anyone from Vietnam able to forward some products from Lazada through to the UK - at a fee, of course - it is just some T Shirts! 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am heading to Vietnam next week. My first destination will be Da Nang and I’m not sure where to stay there because I have seen one of the posts in this channel is about how bad the hotels are in Vietnam. I am planning to stay in Da Nang then will head to North towards Ha Long. Any recommendations would be perfect, thanks folks!

                              <span>Hello guys, my friends and I will be travelling to Saigon. Our flight is scheduled to land at around 1 AM in Saigon. We booked an Airbnb but we’re only allowed to check in by 12 NN. I was wondering are there any 24-hour spots in District 1 where we can stay while waiting for our check-in.
 I’d love to hear if you guys have other tips for us on our situation. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey, so Im a 17 yo german/viet guy and will travel to vietnam for some time and I was wondering how you would actually make friends in vietnam, especially people my age. 
 So my vietnamese is really bad thats why I will probably just stick to english, the question for me is, how widely spoken is english in vietnam these days? Can I help people trying to learn german? Are there any social activities I could participate in? Any tourist spot recommendations?
 Any answer is appreciated!

                              <span>Hello.
 I m european and i will travel to Vietnam by plane to sign on container vessel, i m a seafarer. I have in my checked luggage a 2.5kg sealed bag containing GymBeam True Whey ( protein powder ). One friend of my father scared me and told me that custom agents are very corrupt and if they see that I m european, they will demand money and if i refuse they will even go far as replacing my protein powder with some drugs to convict and jail me. 
 I told him that he s crazy but now i m a bit worried. Can i take my protein with me or should i leave home. I would probably come by plane from Instanbul or Doha.

                              <span>I’m 29f getting engaged to 30m, we’re both Vietnamese but my side does not know anything about this ceremony and his side wants to do it. Everything is mostly taken care of except we don’t know the step of how everything will play out, and supposedly we need a representative to speak and read out the schedule for the day, which we have no clue. Like do I wait with the bridesmaid to accept the gift from the groomsmen or do I stay hidden? Do I serve them tea after? And then his mom give me jewelry? Does anyone have their dam hoi day schedule so I have an idea

                              <span>Alright, first of all, I&#x27;m a Vietnamese. Using English here, because well, why the hell not?
 University in this nation just feels forced. Not like &quot;conscription&quot; stuff but, keeps organizing random events and forces students to participate, and if not, deduct bunch of &quot;diem ren luyen&quot; or whatever. I just feel like students should have the rights to whether to go or not. Like recently, my university had some sort of Shoppe-sponsored event and of course, to make the sponsors happy, they force every students to attend, standing in the sun for 1 hour then listen to annoying love-related songs about bunch of &quot;I love you then you dump me&quot; non-sense. Or forcing students to clean up construction debris in the university. Wow, unpaid working. 10/10, Law university. And upcoming, another sport event that if they didn&#x27;t threaten to deduct points, probably no one would attend because 90% of the students aren&#x27;t bothered to wake up at 8AM in Sunday, just to watch bunch of fellow university students playing badmintons and running.
 I understand the morality behind the non-sense of that points system, for &quot;đánh giá về phẩm chất chính trị, đạo đức, lối sống của sinh viên trên năm mặt đánh giá&quot; but using this so that the teachers can prove that &quot;my university organizes events and the students are totally not enforced to come and this will do very well for publicity&quot; is not really a good excuse to use this points system. Because some university students have their own life to deal with and should not be forced to participate in events that for a lack of better words, they don&#x27;t give a f- about (there&#x27;re defo better words). Just because you can do something doesn&#x27;t mean you should. Students have their own life and you having free time doesn&#x27;t mean you should torture the students.

                              <span>So I am a Vinasun or Grab user usually but my colleague got me turned onto this new Vinfast vehicle based service and it’s now hard to go back. These cars are new, clean, and don’t have plastic on the roof…always wondered what kind of bloody crime occurs in these taxis that a plastic lined roof is necessary…
 Anyways, what are your thoughts? Anyone else enjoying this new service?

                              <span>I’m going to vietnam next week and I went to search up on items to declare while clearing the customs. One of the items is cash.
 Apparently vietnam customs allow you to bring $5000USD or equivalent foreign currencies in cash without a need to declare. But for their own currency, they only allow travellers to bring in 15million VND which is $620USD equivalent. Anymore than 15million VND in cash has to be declared. That is so weird? Anyone has any experience of bringing in more than 15million dongs in vietnam? Do you actually need to declare? If you did, what did they do? Do they just straight up confiscate the difference?
 Edit: People seem confused so I’ll explain further: 
 Guys I am talking about arrivals. Not departure. I’m BRINGING IN 30million dong cash to vietnam to SPEND. I’m NOT BRINGING VND OUT of vietnam. I dont understand why would they limit the bringing of their currency that’s the most legal and accepted to be used in their country so severely. It’s like they are trying to create more business for the money changers there.

                              <span>Is it just me or have you noticed the same. It seems to me that the driving style in Vietnam seems to be slower then for example in Thailand or the west. I don’t know how to describe it. I felt the same in Laos. Some sort of socialist driving style. Maybe it is also because there are so many motorcycles and most look identical. What’s your take on it?

                              <span>Can there be widespread development and well-being in a socialist country like Vietnam?
 Vingroup seems to me to be the classic case of parastatal corruption. They promised to build homes for the people by converting rural areas but then built luxury homes that are inaccessible and currently empty. 
 It seems to me that in VN no one cares about voting and that all they have faith in the government. 
 It seems to me to be a country destined to become a new China if the people do not demand democracy and the fight against corruption. 
 At today we never saw a country without democracy grow up with a stable well-being and in my opinion VN people they need to fight more for their rights.
 What do you think? Why Vietnamese trust this gov?

                              <span>How much should an insurance company pay for the following: 
  
Outpatient treatment 
 Inpatient treatment 
  Medical evacuation to my home country 
 Repatriate remains
  
Is outpatient coverage necessary here as treatment in Vietnam is super cheap? 
 How long should the waiting period for cancer or illnesses? Some insurance companies have a 12 month waiting period for cancer which is ridiculous in my opinion. 
 Thank you so much

                              <span>Husband and I will travel for 2 weeks starting from SGN and end in Hanoi from February 28- March 13th. We were thinking of taking the train up the coast and stopping off at Sapa, Nha Trang, Hue, and still deciding. We like to adventure, eat good food, and not be in touristy scenes if possible! Where we else should we definitely stop and where have you stayed that you enjoyed? Ok with private rooms in hostels, hotels, other unique experiences. Should we book ahead of time or wait til we get there? Thank you 💞💞💞

                              <span>Been here for a while now and I am honestly SO tired of being misled by top tier hotel reviews online that turn out to be rigged or fake. Every “well-reviewed” hotel or accommodation (even higher end ones) I’ve stayed in was so terrible (or subpar at best) despite raving reviews online which leads me to believe it’s all fake and manipulated. 
 Then, whenever you leave an honest review or comment on booking.com or google that isn’t a 9 or 10, hotel staff will literally track you down on your personal whatsapp or e-mail to emotionally blackmail you urging you to delete or edit your comment, or worse! They will even threaten you! 
 Pictures on websites are insanely misleading too and idk why but staff always give off this insanely fake vibe with weird fabricated personas they sport because they they think this somehow pleases tourists? (Spoiler: IT DOES NOT, everything just feels pretty off and not genuine at all).
 All very exhausting. I’m leaving Vietnam soon and couldn’t be happier to leave this all behind me. 
 Sorry I just had to rant for a moment after countless disappointing experiences.

                              <span>Going on a business trip to Ho Chi Minh in April. Never been to VN and I like food. Been to other parts of Asia but VN has been a goal of mine someday. My plan was to find a market and just go for it. I will literally eat anything at least once. 
 Everything I read on this sub looks delicious. Just any tips on what I should do are appreciated. I’m not just going to eat pho or Bahn Mi. Things with fresh herbs and noodles/soups are interesting to me. I like spice and not American guy spicy. I don’t need to eat meat with everything. 
 I have a weekend to explore. Thanks I appreciate it.

                              <span>I would rather have a perfectly executed com tam dish over a filet mignon. I have dreams about this dish. 
 What is the best way to prepare the pork at home? My mouth is watering actually typing this.

                              <span>I’m Vietnamese, but I just found out (because of my family) that I can’t do that one squat. You know that one squat you use when you’re at the market. For some reason I just can’t get my feet to be flat. Not sure if it’s because I’m a kid and still going through puberty but 🤷‍♂️

 If anyone here knows what it means please let me know!

                              <span>Hello friends! I created a facebook group for those who are interested in pursuing surrogacy in the US. This is something that is new to Vietnam but many International parents come to the US for surrogacy. 
 I created this page and I hope to post information for any who are interested. I am Vietnamese American so I do not have many connections in Vietnam to share this page with. 
 If you know anyone in Vietnam struggling with fertility, please share this page! 
 I cannot link it for some reason but the group is called “Mang thai hộ tại hoa kỳ”

The first price I was quoted was 6 million and I talked them down to 4.8 million. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m not fine with the price I paid even if it was overpriced I&#x27;m just curious how well I did bargaining and if I got a good price as at the start of my trip I was overpaying like double at minimum for everything and haggling is a brand new concept to me as a Canadian. Please let me know I&#x27;m curious if I got any better!

                              <span>I’ve been to like a dozen of shops in Hanoi checking: - if they provide tax refunds - what their prices are
 I’ve done it so you don’t have to :)
 Turns out every shop has slightly different prices on Apple products.
 ShopDunk has both the lowest prices AND provide tax certificate so you can get your further 10% off at the airport.
 I paid 9.9M VND for an Apple Watch S9. After tax rebate it’s 9M, about 25% cheaper than I’d pay for it in the UK.
 iPhone 15 works out at around £800, so 20% cheaper than in the UK.
 As far as I can tell there shouldn’t be any regional differences in hardware or software, albeit Apple warranty isn’t international as far as I can tell.

                              <span>As a foreigner, I wish to get the general perspective of Northerners and Southerners. I have lived in Hanoi 7 years and had spent 8 months full time last year in Saigon. As the title suggests, I am genuinely curious as to why? Granted Saigon has been renamed as Ho Chi Minh City, and some suggested it some sort of a reminder to everyone. Is this really the case? I also met people who still refer to the city as Saigon. 
 It does not mean I don&#x27;t see him in Hanoi, just not as much as in Ho Chi Minh City.

 She gets upset about things to do with her parents back home in veitnam, but when I ask about them, I get told not to worry about them. 
 Been with her for nearly 2 years, and married since January. I could understand the general secrecy if it were a relatively new relationship, and kind of has expectations that the secrecy would kinda die off after a few months, but it never did.
 There&#x27;s a whole bunch if questions, that I could never get answers from her on.

                              <span>Question
 Why do so many Vietnamese feel the need to come right next to you when there are so many other spaces. 
 Example: - I&#x27;ll be in a cafe that is totally empty and a noisy Vietnamese family with kids come in. There&#x27;s a 99% guarantee that out of all the empty tables, they&#x27;ll choose to come and sit right next to me.
  
Motorbike parking will be totally empty but I can guarantee someone will park their bike right next to mine (and bang my mirrors while doing so)
 
I&#x27;ll go to the park to relax while it is mostly quiet. Despite being empty, the one group of Vietnamese will almost definitely come and sit right near me. 
 
 Is it a deep rooted fear of being alone or just a desire to piss off other people? (Joke)
 The urinal meme has never been more true.

                              <span>I visited Vietnam for a month to go backpacking with my father. We traveled to Hanoi, Ninh Binh, Meo Vac, Dong Van, Cat Ba and Ha Giang. It was an amazing trip and I learned so much about my dad and what his goals are in life for his next chapter(s). 
 The people of Vietnam were so welcoming and so very kind. The country is beautiful. Thank you for welcoming me into your country during my travels. I can’t wait to come back. ❤️

                              <span>I&#x27;m from the UK and we queue for everything lol especially in shops but while travelling SEA I&#x27;ve noticed a good few times where I&#x27;ve been standing waiting in a queue and a local has just walked infront of me and not even acknowledged it just acts like I&#x27;m not even there. This morning I was getting a train in hcmc and wanted to double check everything was okay with my ticket there was someone getting help when I arrived at the customer service desk and 2 people behind me so very clearly in a line and an older man walked infront of me and then after that it happened again with another older man. Being from the UK and how we queue this is seen as being very rude but is it a common thing here?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been in hcmc for about a week and this morning we were getting ready to leave when we had a knock at the door and it was about 4 police officers asking to check the room and our passports. We&#x27;ve loved staying at that hotel and we&#x27;re always very respectful so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s not anything we&#x27;ve done but is this normal?

The sappier/siller the better cause lbr, the owl (which is where I&#x27;m starting to get a grip on things) is going to teach me the basics but not how to call my wife the love of my life, my angel, sweetheart or something equally or more romantically ridiculous

                              <span>I got trc. So I am qualified for public health insurance. 
 I like my public hospital. It is cheaper than the private hospitals. 
 I recently bought cheap private insurance here in Vietnam and they rejected my claim. 
 The sales rep for that insurance lied to me about my insurance coverage. Due to my budget, I had to buy this private insurance. 
 My current insurance company will not cover for pre-existing conditions. 
 My employer only gives me accident insurance. They do not give me health insurance which sucks. 
 I do not drive. 
 Outpatient is cheap here. 
 My budget is tight so I wanr to save as much money as possible. 
 I am wondering if public health insurance is enough. 
 Do I need to still buy private insurance in addition to public health insurance? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, when I was very young my neighbor used to come back from Vietnam and gift us silk pjs and gold bracelets. They were my favorite pjs, just simple shorts and tank tops. Obviously I out grew them. 
 Now that I’m adult and traveling to Da Nang I’d like to buy some. I don’t care for them to be tailored, it’s just a pj. I’m looking for a nightgown, short and tank top set, and maybe a robe. And maybe some gold jewelry if it is affordable.
 Are there shops I can buy this already made? Any store/address recommendations? Even if I go to Hoi An, I only have time for one day so they would have to make it same day by 7pm. 
 Thanks kindly!

                              <span>Good day, I found on the Internet such a thing as Autoblow Ultra. I want to try it out, but they say on the Internet that legally a thing of this nature will not be allowed through customs, otherwise you won’t end up with problems. Has anyone already encountered similar “problems” and is there a way to get the desired item while in Vietnam?

                              <span>I know Vietnamese are pragmatic and that chữ quốc ngữ is way more practical for everyday use, learning and teaching. Nevertheless, I wonder how the Vietnamese state, the society and individual are interested in their Vietnamese cultural heritage. Do people offer it at school like how many western nations may also offer to teach a dead language like latin? Do people use it for modern poems and literature?
 What I personally love about Chinese style characters isn&#x27;t just the aesthetics, but the connection and meaning that each character holds. They don&#x27;t just decorate the temples and literature of the past. For example, did you knew that the family name Ngô 吳 does not refer to maize/corn 玉米 , which is also called ngô in Vietnamese? I did not for a long time. I think the usage of Chinese characters can make some differentiation in phonetically same sounding words and its kinda neat.
 I also find concepts and attempts like Quốc âm tân tự and chữ Nôm mới very interesting.

                              <span>I am planning my Vietnam trip and honestly, I really don&#x27;t know what to do for the last few days. Northern Vietnam was quite easy to plan, but now I&#x27;m stumped. Here&#x27;s what I have so far:
 2 days Hanoi
 2 days Cat Ba
 1 day Hanoi
 2 days Sapa
 2 days Ninh Binh
 1 day Hue
 2 days Hoi An
 I got 6 more days and I need to end up in Ho Chi Minh City for the flight home. What would you recommend?

 My name is Thanh (F) and it&#x27;s weird that I can&#x27;t find any soulmate on dating apps. I keep searching but seems so impossible haha. So, I want to take a chance to introduce me on Reddit, hope to find a companion 😉. As I always get busy with heavy workload and meetings, I have no time to prepare myself. Moreover, I am surrounded by married guys and LGBT guys in the office environment, so.. yah.
 /Recent status/
 I have been existent on Earth for 24 yrs. I just turned 24 a few days ago. Before, I&#x27;d never thought that It would be necessary to date and get married to someone. Recently, I&#x27;ve healed from childhood trauma by myself and I realized that I do need a companion in my life.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m wondering how expats living in Vietnam handle their health insurance?
 I am moving to Vietnam soon for work (my employer does not provide health coverage), and I plan to take out some travel insurance initially to cover any accidents or emergencies, and then find a health insurance plan provider after I arrive. Not sure if this it the best way of doing it though.
 Does anyone have any recommendations or advice? I&#x27;m interested to hear how you insure yourself and which providers you recommend.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I just had the worst train experience in my whole life. I and my friend went to buy the bunk beds for our 7 hour trip. The toilets are too filthy as they pissed all over it and there is not enough space, it likes you are locked inside a cramped closet with piss filled every fucking corner. The train shaked and as it stopped it almost made me fall into those piss filled corner in the toilet. The noise I could endure but there was a family with little kids who kept kicking the wall during the night. The staff smuggled people so they can charge 10$ per bunk bed while when we officially bought the tickets it was 30$ per seat. As we only bought 2 seats, the 10$ illegal bought beds above us hung their feets right above our head, kicking in the beds so we could not sleep for the whole night. And the train staff, seeing that we realized she smuggled people onto the train and felt we bought our beds so she couldn&#x27;t make anymore money, treated us as garbage and was being rude the whole ride. I doubt they ever change their attitude or service so I won&#x27;t ever get on a train in Vietnam for my long ride anymore. It was not worth it. I was very tired and both disgusted and angry with suck an awful train service.

                              <span>I was walking around Saigon exploring random convenience stores in Tan Dinh and D3 between meetings, and noticed how most western branded goods are priced almost as much (if not more than) as they would sell in the US. 
 ​
 Products like Cerave, Cetaphil, St Ives, etc are all priced at US levels, which is something I&#x27;ve never seen in other Asian countries. In China or India, Unilever or P&amp;G would try to match local prices, but in VN they are completely unabashed in price gouging. 
 ​
 While I do understand that these would be luxury products for most Vietnamese, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen this lack of price localization almost anywhere in the developing world.

 This is an old performance by someone who is not Vietnamese. The caption is in Russian, but I was able to translate it via Google Translate. The part pertaining to the lyrics state that she sings the following:
 &quot;It’s wonderful to love like this in the spring, when the expanse of fields blooms. The valleys turn green again, the nightingale captivates with the song. Leave me, leave me, I’m in a hurry to go to the market. I won’t hide it, I love you, but it’s a pity I can’t stay... &quot;
 The caption goes on to say that the song was created it back in 1957, when the performer participated in a tour of Vietnam as part of a delegation of Soviet art masters. It states that she is wearing the national costume donated to her by the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture.
 I am curious if the song is accurate. Is she really singing in Vietnamese? I don&#x27;t know enough to be able to tell myself. Thank you.

                              <span>Hello all!
 So I’m in VN for a few months and don’t have much friends yet with similar interests. I do love going to experimental music places and raves back in Europe. Something that I would do with friends mainly and also alone. I’m born European and so know the culture and social codes even in underground spaces.
 So now that I’m on my own here in VN for ths first time ever, I found a bunch of parties I would like to attend, at locations for example: The Observatory, Arcan and The Bar Commune Lab.
 Now all my europe friends are like ‘you should NOT go alone,cause its dangerous to do things alone as a cute female in a third world country’ and in the meanwhile all my friends who are from south east asia themselves, that I met in Europe, are excited for me te explore on my own in VN and make new friends by just showing up here.
 So, what do yall think? Can I go around on my own? Ofcourse a lot of basic female going out things apply like, dont accept drinks from strangers and stuff but idk, I dont feel like Vietnam is that unsafe and these spaces seem experienced when it comes to internationality?
 My viet language is super beginner tho..

 I was talking to my coworker about houses in China, and he said that Ho Chi Minh District 1&#x27;s prices are ridiculous, given that for the same price (let&#x27;s say 500k), you could buy a 1500 sqft house in let&#x27;s say, Columbia MD, where many people agree is a good place to live.
 Or a 3000 sqft house in Sugarland TX, which let&#x27;s face it, is amongst the best values for money in America given you get a top rated school system (according to USNews), being in a rich and educated community, and having quite good weather rather than hot/humid weather even in the winter and tropical diseases.

 This job is kind of unique and I&#x27;m also new in the field of looking for an English teacher, so if know where I can look for them, or if you are looking for a job yourself, please let me know.
 English as the mother tongue is preferred.
 Thanks a lot.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m solo travelling and I&#x27;m looking for a nice place to stay from 12/12 - 10/01. After a month of hard work I really need to rest and I&#x27;m looking to just sit and dive on a beach.
 I was searching for Phu Quoc but came across some threads saying it&#x27;s all fake and overpriced (?). Do you recommend it or not?
 I&#x27;m not looking for party or busy places, just something chill, where I can walk to some beaches, have a beer and maybe rent a bike to explore the surroundings.
 Alternatives are destinations like Phuket but it seems the weather is not so good there now.
 The only thing to keep in mind is that I need to work, so good wifi is mandatory.
 Really appreciate your help. Thanks!

 I can somewhat read stuff based on the words that I see, but I have a lot of trouble with identifying and applying the accents on the words. Conversely, I have even more trouble with writing.
 What&#x27;s the best way to get started with learning how the accents affect the words?

                              <span>Hi, I am currently in Vietnam and plan to do the Ha Giang Loop from 12/19-24. I have come across multiple posts discouraging booking a guided tour. I am currently riding from HCMC to Hanoi and rented a bike from Tigit. They have an interesting option where one can rent a guide for $140 a day (plus all expenses for the guide). I was maybe thinking if anyone would want to join, we could split the cost of the guide and have our own smaller tour. This would not be an &quot;easy-rider&quot; situation and you would have to ride your own bike. Tigit also rents bikes and gear for a fee. Link below for the guide. Thank you.

                              <span>I am going to Ho Chi Minh soon and my finance and we would love to take our engagement photos there. We are hoping to find a photographer that also provides different outfits for us to change into and different sceneries. Does anyone have suggestions on who we can go to? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Is there really such a thing as a &#x27;genius&#x27;?
 I came across articles claiming that a 2.5-year-old baby can read numbers and speak English, even though the child is Vietnamese and hasn&#x27;t been exposed to an English-speaking environment or received any formal teaching. My dad believes it 100%, but I&#x27;ve mentioned that it might be for marketing or a gameshow aiming to attract more views

                              <span>It&#x27;s kind of weird seeing all this talk about &quot;western&quot; stuff in this sub. Some people here toss around this strange idea of &quot;western&quot; and it just feels way off to me. It&#x27;s like &quot;western&quot; only accounts for the image of the USA. As a German, I don&#x27;t feel represented by that concept at all.
 Germany and the USA are worlds apart politically and culturally, despite both being tagged as &quot;western&quot;. Alone in Europe there is so much cultural differences.
 And then there&#x27;s the comment sections, turning into what feels like an active war. You got one group throwing a bunch of untrue, mostly negative stuff about Vietnam, and another group firing back with a pro-Vietnam vibe while dissing &quot;the West&quot;, saying so much stuff that basically only applies to the USA.

                              <span>I was wondering if I could maybe get some clarification here about something a colleague told me. So a bit of background information: We both live in the Netherlands he goes to school here and says he has both a Dutch and a Vietnamese passport and he is now 18. But he told me that when he was 17 he needed to go to Vietnam for mandatory military service for a year and that he was a Sergeant-Major. Is this even possible because from what I could find you can only start service in Vietnam when you are between 18-25 and I doubt that becoming a Sergeant-Major is easy. So is he telling the truth or is he just telling some made up story for some &quot;clout&quot;?

                              <span>I’m curious to hear from those who grew up in Vietnam. Is corporal punishment still seen as the most effective way of child rearing in Vietnam?
 I grew up in the USA. My parents are both in their late 60’s/early 70’s, dad spent a couple decades as a POW. I was routinely beaten and kind of grew up resenting it. More often than not, they were unfair and often was due to a misunderstanding. I had thought that part of the reason was his years spent in prison, but apparently this was just how he was. When I had vented to my aunts and uncles about it, they specifically told me a story about my dad beating my aunt when she was 8 because she accidentally dropped a christmas light that shattered (he’s between 10-15 years older than her, for reference).

                              <span>I will be travelling to Vietnam two weeks from now and I just found out i’m pregnant. For the record, I didn’t initially plan on coming there to get an abortion I just want to spend Christmas. But its here now and I see Vietnam legalized abortion and would love to get it while i’m there. 
 What’s the name of the best clinic that can assist me? and any idea with the cost. Thank you.

                              <span>A few weeks ago I traveled from the bus station Sapa, where a dog was crying locked in a cage. I have been thinking about him a lot since then. Does anyone know something about him? Does the owner release him for the time the station is closed? It was heartbreaking seeing the dog locked in that tiny cage. What kind of life is this?

                              <span>Hello, need advice.. is April a good month to visit all of those places? I know north and south have different weather so im trying to figure out which is the most optimal time to visit if i wanna a do a trip from south to north. Ive just been to Hanoi a few weeks ago but unable to visit Sapa because the weather was not favorable and wasnt able to do the Ha Giang Loop tour bec i had limited time, so on my next trip i want to cover those as well as Hoi Anh and Hue. Thank you in advance for the advice. 😅

                              <span>I’m having pains in my mouth, this procedure will cost me about 1,000$ at home, in Vietnam probably much less. 
 Is it a good idea tho? Are the dentists in big cities good?

                              <span>Was in District 1 the other night, around 8pm in the vicinity of Pham Ngu Lao when a dude walked past, wearing a wifebeater vest and nothing else. 
 Another time, I rode through Tan Binh probably around 10pm when there was a dude completely naked and playing with himself at the side of the road. 
 In both instances, neither traffic nor pedestrians seemed to even bat an eyelid. In other countries, people would be alarmed or shocked but in Vietnam it didn&#x27;t even warrant a second glance. Is this something normal or are people just too afraid to do anything?

                              <span>Sorry to be another tourist asking about Ha Giang.. I was hoping to go the first week of February, will it be burning season by then? I am seeing some mixed information as to when it starts, but I&#x27;d really like to avoid it so that the views/air quality aren&#x27;t disturbed. I am aware it&#x27;ll be quite cold at this time

                              <span>Im planning to write an article related to this topic, hence would like to collect your sharing.
 I observe that social media (especially Facebook watch) is definately creating a negative personality of my parents and other middle aged adults in general. I saw them watch several meaningless and no value contents (in many topics, for example: cancer maker (without any verification), some dudes telling you how to live a life lol) then they share to us with the thought that it’s a reference that we should follow and absorb. It’s hard to say but I feel like the social media is changing the middle-aged people’s mental health. I think because they aren’t growing up with the social media like us (late of Gen Y and on) so they are lacking of “pick and choose tools” when using social media. They are the most vulnerable social media users I think. What u think bout this? Let’s share some thoughts or any practical case?

                              <span>I hate over changing currencies so I prefer using card. However, I’ve travelled to cities that do not accept cards totally but I’ve also travelled to countries that don’t require me to use cash at all and I ended up over exchanging. 
 Firstly, I just want to know is Ho Chi Minh cashless friendly ? I’m there for 5 days only to shop, eat and chill. Secondly, My plan is to change 50% of my currency 50% in card. Is that a good or bad idea ?
 Lastly, if they do accept cards are they typically the paywave that don’t require me to insert the card and enter they key?
 Thank u

                              <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;m thinking of buying Apple Watch and would like to ask several questions on how it is suitable for usage in Vietnam for my purposes.
 What I have: iPhone + &#x27;SimA&#x27; and going to buy Apple Watch Series 9 41mm with eSim support (and I put there &#x27;SimB&#x27;).
 - Can I leave the phone at home and go out with the watch + &#x27;SimB&#x27; only and be able to see messages on facebook and Zalo and write/record basic replies (without having any kind of headset)?
 - Can I see/reply to calls/sms which come to &#x27;SimA&#x27; (which is in the phone) when I&#x27;m outdoors with the watch only (the phone is at home)?
 - Can I use the phone to answer calls/sms which come to the &#x27;SimB&#x27; (which in the watch)?
 - Can I use the watch to order grab car/bike and see how the car/bike is approaching on the map?
 - Can I make Sacombank money transfers using the watch only?
 I know that there are Grab/FB/Zalo apps for Apple Watch but I&#x27;m curious how they are actually usable (especially on 41mm watch screen)? Also it is not clear if there is a &#x27;full&#x27; Sacombank app (or Apple Pay support only).
 I appreciate any help

                              <span>Me and my wife where travelling the Mai Chau valley, just enjoying the view, going through the villages. One of the houses was blasting dance music, we went over and saw the locals are having a birthday.
 For some reason they really, really, really wanted us to join them and we figured why not. So we danced a little and they immediately offered us their booze (don&#x27;t really know what it was, maybe banana wine?), we drank one glass but they really really wanted us to drink more, at some point we really had to push them off. When we figured we want to leave they grabbed us by the hands (as if to keep on dancing with us) and they where actually holding unreasonable firmly, one might even call it violently. At the end we managed to shake them off and just wave them goodbye.
 It&#x27;s important to note, the whole settings where very friendly, there where Children, women and elderly in the party, so we don&#x27;t think those guys had bad intentions and do us harm. We do wonder why they where so keen on having us on their celebration and why the hell where they holding so strongly?

                              <span>Hi guys. I&#x27;m traveling vietnam north to South with my vietnamese grandfather for two months. We are currently in hue and I&#x27;m a bit lost. My grandfather is a great guy but spending two months with the same person can be a bit hectic. I am far away from my vietnamese family in the south and further away from my friends and family home. I am looking for someone to explore the beautiful city of hue. Is there someone who wants to meet up?
 Don&#x27;t hesitate to contact me! I&#x27;m a great guy who is just a bit far away from home.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about the opinions of Vietnamese people on relationships. The motivation behind my inquiry is that many of my wife&#x27;s friends have experienced divorce, or remarriage, or are seeking partners with more financial stability than their exes. some of their husbands, who happen to be my friends, claim a common issue of feeling controlled. 
 In contrast, I have been clear with my wife that either of you is free to walk away without strings attached if the relationship reaches a point of no hope.

                              <span>I keep reading on different websites that HCMC has nightlife that almost rivals Bangkok, how it&#x27;s the second biggest party spot in SEA, etc.
 Just got here last night. Bui Ven seems to have more people in the street than the actual clubs and it all started to die down at midnight. Lush was tiny and about 75% empty. Faham just had some small groups sitting down with balloons, Observatory was dead...
 For a Friday night after all the hype I saw online I was a bit disappointed. Am I just going to the wrong places or does Vietnam just not have a nightlife oriented culture?

                              <span>As a true Hanoian for more than 20 years and a foodie, i just want to recommend some good food in Hanoi for some tourist here or any people living in Hanoi should try. These food is must try in this cold winter weather :D
  
Bánh đúc nóng (a snack falty food with rice cake dipped with fish sauce, pork, cilantro, fried scallions) 
 Cháo sườn (pork-ribs congee)
 Bánh trôi tàu ( hot sweet ginger soup, rice cakes filled with sesame, top with coconut and peanuts) 
 Cháo đậu cà (rice congee with fried tofu and salted eggplant fruit): apparently i just know this dish recently havent tried it but its known for a very famous dish for people here to eat in autumn-winter.

 I&#x27;m one half of a lesbian couple living in usa. My wife is Vietnamese. We&#x27;re hoping to have kids in the near future and then moving to Vietnam to raise them. How do we ensure kids have Vietnamese citizenship? I will be the one carrying them, biologically we&#x27;re using my wife&#x27;s eggs.
 Please let me know if flair is wrong.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Literally going to Mua Cave in hours to hike and the bunch of stuff you do based on the tour.
 Is it wise to wear shorts in this weather or better to wear shorts because of the hike and cycling?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve been travelling to Vietnam for a few weeks now and loving it so far. I want to have a chilled weekend in Ho Chi Minh City.
 In Hanoi, I loved to chill at Hoan Kiem Lake - I just had a nice time just sitting/walking around there and I found that locals would approach to practice their English with me there which made it extra nice.
 If there somewhere similar in HCMC? I’m in District 1 but don’t mind wandering.
 All suggestions welcome! Thanks!
 EDIT: it doesn’t even have to be the whole day/weekday but is there somewhere that’s just nice to walk around?

                              <span>I collect license plates as a hobby and noticed that I couldn’t find any Vietnamese plates for sale on eBay or any other site, but when visiting Ha Noi I found a shop that sells them. It didn’t seem suspicious or anything, he had them all over the front door as advertisement. 
 I’m wondering why these plates aren’t sold online though since I’ve managed to find nearly every other country’s plates up for sale on eBay

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I will be visiting Vietnam in a few weeks (Dec 26 to Jan 11) and I will be in a group of 3. I was wondering if it is better to book activities, tours, transport etc. in advance or if it would be alright to just book when we&#x27;re over there?
 Mostly just want to know the best way to go about this as we&#x27;re all excited and a little bit nervous and I would like things to go as smoothly as possible!
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious, with how open Vietnam is today and how many people will fall in love across all kinds of identities and nationalities I imagine plenty of folk will be born in Vietnam in a mixed family. Especially in Saigon.
 For anyone with knowledge on this, what í that like? Is there bullying in the local schools? Anything to worry about? What can you share?
 Thank you

                              <span>Currently in Sapa, and have the option for a 1 day hike up Fansipan and catch the cable car nack. It will cost about $150 (Aud) and it&#x27;s looking like it will be cloudy tomorrow. Would this be worth it? And does anyone have any other reccomendations?

                              <span>Why do people keep roosters (which crow noisily each morning before dawn) in a densely populated urban area (Hanoi in this case)? Are they there to sire additional chickens, to be a watchdog for security purposes, etc.? From my and I’m sure 99.99% other neighboring residents’ perspective, it’s just another source of rude, inconsiderate noise (as probably hundreds of people are subjected to it; fortunately I’m not right next door, but I feel for those who are). Or should it be regarded as just another source of local “color?”

                              <span>Hi all, I am visiting my family in Vietnam for the first time in 6 years and I&#x27;m looking to buy them gifts from the US. Besides things like medicine, clothes, and accessories; I would like to buy them something that would improve their quality of life. The only thing I can think of right now is an air purifier to combat the air pollution lol. But since they&#x27;re bulky and are pretty readily available in Vietnam, should I buy it here or wait until I get home? I really appreciate any other gift ideas as well!!

 Travelling tomorrow to Hoi An from dec 1st to dec 4th. I have been following accuweather actively to assess the risk of floods while we are in the region. Seems like it is going to be pretty wet. 
 Where can i see the official warnings issued for the region? Any recommended website? 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>my last name is huynh (both of my parents coincidentally were born with this last name) but they don’t speak chinese and none of my grandparents or great grandparents were from china. we don’t know about the ancestors before that. however everyone always assumes we’re chinese (including chinese ppl) and are shocked to find out we’re not, i also googled common chinese/hoa last names and this was one of the most popular. i have a strong inkling we might be Hoa people and i’m close to getting a dna test just to find out but i haven’t been able to get one yet. the only other huynh/hoang i know are also Hoa and from saigon where i heard there’s a big hoa population. does anyone know if this last name indicates chinese descent at some point in the lineage? are there any kinh people with this name?

                              <span>Hi Reddit Vietnam brains trust. Hoping someone can help me out, with quite a specific and niche type question in regards to a Vietnam eSim provider for mobile/cell phones.
 I was in a rush flying out of Vietnam last week. My physical Vietnamese sim cardoesn&#x27;tnt support global roaming.
 I need a local Vietnam number (eSim only as I&#x27;m not in Vietnam atm) to receive calls/text messages while overseas (ie needs to offer global roaming capability).
 Seems the majority of eSim providers for Vietnam, don&#x27;t offer global roaming + local Vietnamese number. 
 Zalo, Skype and Viber are the less preferred options, as I need to be contactable on a local Vietnamese number.
 Think I&#x27;m out of luck and will have to use alternative methods, till I&#x27;m back in Vietnam. Unless someone on here can help.

 Hi! I’m new to the community but would like some help choosing a name from the members of this sub!
 I am a 2nd generation Vietnamese-American with both parents from south Vietnam. I have gone through many names during my time of being kinda out as trans-masculine and all of them have been either generically white male names or just English words. I’m hoping to legally change my name soon to something more permanent and closely tied to my culture. I have been immersed in Vietnamese culture and tradition ever since I was a child but when I was born I was given an American name instead of a Vietnamese one. I used to be grateful for this because it reduced the amount of bullying I got for being Asian but now I just want a name that connects to the culture and people that raised me.
 I’d just like some suggestions from other Vietnamese people on male names :) I’d also accept and consider just object names! I used to go by Zero at one point so I’m no stranger to non-name sounding names lmao
 Thank you in advance! :D

                              <span>I recently had a wonderful journey to Vietnam. As an expat in Thailand driving regularly there it seemed to me that the traffic in Vn is more ruthless and unforgiving especially when crossing a road. My Thai wife simply refused to cross when she saw the circumstances. Is this lack of experiance?

                              <span>This accident happened about 10 meters in front of me today and in real time. Probably a 3-4 year old kid standing on the motorcycle with both his parents sitting in front and behind him, and as always, he wasn&#x27;t wearing a helmet but the parents were.
 The dad driver did a close maneuever to overtake a public bus but probably forgot about the son standing right behind him. Consequently, the kid&#x27;s head collided with the side mirror of the bus, causing him to lose balance and fall off the bike. But lucky enough, he fell AWAY from the bus or else it would be a much bloodier scene.
 I don&#x27;t get this, you can afford a bike, you can afford two helmets each for yourself and your wife, you can afford clothes, you can probably afford a smartphone as well, but a child&#x27;s helmet crosses the line? Here&#x27;s an unpopular opinion, if you can&#x27;t financially &amp; mentally afford a child&#x27;s helmet, then you probably shouldn&#x27;t have a child. Don&#x27;t even get me started on letting your child stand on a moving bike. It was a cringey horror scene but I kinda felt like it should happen more often for them to finally learn.

I&#x27;d like to go to a rural village/ serene place for 2 days before NYE. I&#x27;ve looked into Can Tho and the floating markets look interesting. Any recommendations on places to visit in the country side?

                              <span>Hi all,
 First of all, my situation:
 I&#x27;ve been living in HCMC for almost 2 years now but I&#x27;m thinking of leaving. My reasons are the high rent, the noise and air pollution, and the traffic.
 Rent here is the highest in Vietnam I think, higher than in Ha Noi I&#x27;ve been told.
 About noise, I tried lots of places and honestly outside of &quot;luxury&quot; high rise appartments, other places are affected by noise at night or early morning to the point of being unlivable. I got really depressed once because a place a rented had neighbours arguing all day, karaoke and loud drunk talking at night, funerals,... 
 About air pollution, it&#x27;s worse these days, I can see smog most time I look outside from a high enough floor.
 Traffic is also getting worse. I came to HCMC right at the end of COVID quarantine so it was somewhat normal then, then it got gradually worse. 
 Now my question: I&#x27;m considering moving to another city, probably Da Nang. Is Da Nang really better in terma of rent, noise, air and traffic? I&#x27;ve been there once and think it&#x27;s better but it was just a short trip so I&#x27;m not sure, heard some stories about karaoke in Da Nang so I want to hear more from everyone.

 Do they automatically transfer your checked bags or do I need to run and go get it and recheck to the other airlines?

                              <span>Am I being scammed somehow ?
 I just moved into a studio apartment in D1 in HCMC. Got a decent price: around 7.5mil per month. Just a small bedroom and bathroom, no living room or anything. 
 I wanted to check the electric meter outside my room so I turned off electronics and it wasn’t moving. So far so good. 
 I don’t use the fridge , so it’s been off the whole month. Most of my electric usage is for my A/C that runs about 12 hours per day. Otherwise the only other electricity I use is for charging my laptop, or my projector if I’m using it (rarely).
 Electric bill comes in at the end of the month a staggering 1 million vnd! I speak to a neighbor from the house next door. He says he’s paying around 400k for the entire house! 
 Now I know the price per KW is 3.000 vnđ, but the landlords make a profit by charging 4.000 vnd. So I’m thinking that either my A/C is super congested and using up a ton of electricity or my landlord is somehow screwing me. 
 Any thoughts? I will be talking to him about this issue in 2 days when I pay rent.

                              <span>Hello Vietnam!
 Sorry for another travel post but after reading through the sub, and watching videos I figured making a post may be the best method since I have some unique elements to my inquiry.
 I spent most of the year working on a project that took a lot of my time, it wrapped in November but I have quite a bit of vacation to use up now. I&#x27;ve always wanted to go to Vietnam. I was in a LT relationship that recently ended and so that factored in with the work leave is making me think now may be a good time however, it&#x27;d be a solo trip and pretty spontaneous due to time.
 My travel window would be likely Dec 8 - 21st. Outside of the US, I&#x27;ve traveled to Asia three times (Japan once, Korea twice). I did solo travel to Japan but I knew very basic Japanese and don&#x27;t know any Vietnamese.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m going to Vietnam in a month, I&#x27;m from Italy so EURO.
 I have Curve, Revolut and BBVA and none of them charge me for exchange fees or atm withdrawal abroad.
 I&#x27;ve read though that in Vietnam every time you withdraw from an ATM or pay with a card you are charged an extra ~3% fee from the Vietnamese bank. Is that so?
 What&#x27;s the most convenient option? Is exchanging EURO at the airport the cheapest option?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m from New Zealand and learned recently that the Cham people speak an Austronesian language, which is the same linguistic family as Te Reo Māori from NZ. 
 What I&#x27;ve also noticed is that Vietnamese seems to have some loan words from the Cham language, like:
 Eye - mắt - mblak (Cham). Mata (Māori) can mean face, but may sometimes refer to eye, eyebrow, or looking out. The Cham word for face is also mata.
 This - này - ne (Cham) - nei (Māori) (usually used as tēnei, but also by itself, like in ā te pō nei (this night).
 There are quite a few more that I found.
 Because of these similarities, could there be more of a Cham influence on Vietnamese than I thought? Is it common knowledge that the Cham language has influence on Vietnamese and vice versa?

                              <span>I am a textile sesign student and recently I have been making patterns based on Vietnam&#x27;s Tet Nguyen Dan and one of the prints contain the fruits present in Mam Ngu Qua. I had been using a book to figure out what all fruits can be added (as main or substitutions) in it and it mentioned figs as one of the substitution that can be added on the tray and it stuck with me and I made a design with that as well. Now I found some websites that claimed figs are not used at all and its making me nervous as I don&#x27;t have enough time to remove it from the design before I am to showcase the collection for marking. So before I chuck it out of my collection, I thought I should come here amd ask you guys. What do you think I should do?

                              <span>I have started making my own Vietnamese drip coffee at home, but I am not sure of the “proper” way to brew. Sometimes, a vacuum is formed from the heat and condensation and seals the lid shut, causing the coffee to not drip into the cup. Am I supposed to break the vacuum seal? Do I just leave it for 10-15 minutes until the temps drop and the vacuum breaks on its own? Is a vacuum seal supposed to even happen?
 Sorry, I am new to dripping my own coffee. Please don’t flame me!

The scammer told him that he needs $2000 for an operation. As kind hearted (and somehow gullible) man, my uncle sent $2000 on the spot. And he is one of the poor relatives among my family. I feel so bad for him. I feel so sorry for his family. His wife works day and night for a clothing factory with really bad conditions and he is a construction worker in Vietnam. Can someone help me and tell me how I can help him? I only have this one information of this scammers bank account.

                              <span>I am planning a trip to Hanoi for 2week trip in march. I plan to have some luxury stays and some very minimal cheap stays to get a feel of what I can bare. I am getting tired of US politics and crazy events lately. I want to learn more the resilience and beliefs of Vietnamese and maybe Buddhism. 
 Ultimately I want to see if I can be retired snowbird in Vietnam Jan-April or live in the region (Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, ect..). I am 53 and healthy and athletic. I raised two wonderful adult ladies and separating from a controlling spouse. I want to be free and take someone that we can mutually take care of each other. I want to connect with authentic people/community that support each other and live a less complicated life.
 I am a Korean migrated to US and I never felt I belonged. I look Korean but white in the inside with my upbringing. I am looking back now and want to meet people like me. Think differently, feel, love. I am looking for friends to hang out and eat and go to clubs. New connections that will pull me back to Asia and feel at home. 
 Question 1. What would be better than Hanoi for value for money compared to other Asian cities. 
 Question 2. Do you find it&#x27;s easy to make good authentic friendship with travelers and local people? Is it easy to date and any advice on best way to find activities with other singles wanting to connect in Hanoi. Connect and travel together?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;d like to learn Vietnamese but I don&#x27;t know where to start. I have no prior exposure of the language or country whatsoever so I really am clueless about Vietnamese culture. However after doing a little research I found out that people are divided on what the standard dialect of Vietnamese is. Google articles say the standard dialect is Northern Vietnamese but will also tell you that you should learn the Southern dialect instead and materials that teach you the Northern dialect I&#x27;ve noticed are kind of frowned upon. I really have no idea what these mean Which sounds stupid I know but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll take the time to learn. Does it really matter which dialect I will learn between those two? Are the differences between the two dialects really that noticeable to the point of miscommunication? I also noticed that learning Vietnamese is also not as accessible as learning other languages like Chinese or German so if anyone has/know any free resources to learn Vietnamese then I&#x27;d appreciate if you&#x27;ll share it in the comments... Thankss

I only drive around the city and am in traffic a decent amount...I&#x27;ve heard fully automatic bikes aren&#x27;t great for busy areas. Let me know if you have any advice, xin cảm ơn. ^^

 Me and four other family members will be travelling to Ho Chi Minh this December. May I ask which street or district is ideal to stay at for the duration of our tour? 
 Also, I would like to know some recommendations for a 3-day tour doable by people ranging from 18 to 68 years old. I hope you can help me out in this tour. Ideas about the public transportation access will also be helpful. 
 Thanks so much! Looking forward to your replies! :)

                              <span>Our family of 5 adults will be flying into TSN airport from Seoul mid-December (as part of our trip from the US). Has anyone experienced the priority immigration line and whether it is worth paying for it (we already have our e-visas)?
 It seems to me that the priority line is mainly for aircrew staff. Do these immigration line &quot;fast-track&quot; services &quot;bribe&quot; immigration officials so customers could use that line also?
 I&#x27;ve also heard that the line closest to the priority immigration line (heard towards the left) tends to be quickest. Has anyone experienced that to be true?

                              <span>Chào mọi người,
 The wife and I want to go to vũng tàu soon. I&#x27;m Người nước ngoài, and she&#x27;s originally from Vietnam but grew up abroad, where we met. We now live in Vietnam.
 She remembers Vũng tàu public beaches with food vendors, beer vendors, chair vendors, etc. I&#x27;ve been to beaches like this, and while you always need to watch yourself from getting ripped off, I enjoy having the option to buy some food and drinks from people coming up right to your spot on the beach and the variety of stuff that they might bring. She remembers it fondly too. But I&#x27;ve read that the govt has possibly restricted vendors from these beaches? Is this true? And are there no beaches that have these vendors? We&#x27;re trying to plan the trip and I can&#x27;t find any real answers can someone help me?
 Nước ngoài translation:
 Tôi (người nước ngoài) và vợ muốn đi du lịch ở vũng tàu để đi biển, đi chơi, ăn hải sản, v.v... vợ tôi nhớ vũng tàu có nhiều người bán đồ ăn, bìa, thuê ghế ở biển. Tôi đã đi biển khác mà có người bán, và tôi rất là thích Những mà, tôi mới đọc mầ chín phủ không cho phép người bán trên biển nữa. Có đúng không?.
 Sorry if that Vietnamese gives anyone heartburn. Thanks for the advice!

                              <span>Finhay is an investing app that my wife and I came across a few years back. The interest rates are about 2% higher than traditional banks. We put a fair bit of money in it, collected nice interest, and used it to pay off our mortgage. As we start building up our savings again, we are questioning whether to continue saving money in Finhay at higher interest rates (~8%) or to put it in traditional banks (~6%), which of course have risks of their own in Vietnam&#x27;s relatively wild west financial system.
 I&#x27;d love to hear any insight you all have on the safety &amp; risks of Finhay. Thanks so much!

                              <span>Is it a pipe dream to believe Vietnam will become like Singapore or S.Korea like many of the govt people claim the country is headed in 3 decades? Is it more likely Vietnam will be in the same economic league like Indonesia and Thailand are at the moment? What kind of Vietnam will we see in 30 years?

Thứ nhất, em thấy giá cả chi phí cao so tình hình kinh tế nhà em. Thứ 2, đó là em ở lớp ko thích mấy thành phần(ích kỷ, nói xấu,...). Nên em lên đây xin ý kiến mọi người ạ. Em cảm ơn rất nhiều

I feel as though google translate makes it lose its essence
 Edit: I&#x27;d also love to know more about the depth of the words that had been used. So in case there is something special about the vocabulary, grammar and so on, I would absolutely appreciate some explanations. I&#x27;m ready for a vietnamese &quot;lesson&quot; :)))))

Seems like from looking online most of those are three days but unfortunately we can’t do that. Additionally, most of our group are fluent in Vietnamese. Thank you!

                              <span>Flying into Saigon on 12/28, wondering if i should commit 5 nights there and stay for NYE or do 3 nights and fly out early on the 31st to Da Nang and just party there. Honestly with the wife so some fireworks and a nice fun vibe would be cool. Just not sure if its worth to stay 5 nights in Saigon just for NYE when the caves and mountains in the north are calling.

                              <span>Hi everyone I need to report a sexual assault that happened in tam coc a few days ago. Unfortunately, the Ninh Binh police hang up on me as they do not speak English. Is there an email address or hotline that could help me with this ? It drives me mad knowing this man is walking around without worries doing the same to other women. Also, I have videos of him running away from me, but guess those are unlikely to help unless there are cameras on the streets showing his face. Thanks for your help

The usual ones on the street cafes I believe are Robusta? Those are the ones I really like, and do it Vietnamese style, with condensed milk 😅😅😅. At the moment I use Trung Nguyen S but I was wondering if there are far better ones I could buy in Ho Chi Minh ☺️ thank you ☺️

These are gifts to family members in Hanoi. I&#x27;ve heard stories of people having to pay fines because custom officers at Noi Bai will think they&#x27;re for resale. Is that still going on or is she going to be fine?

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 I am 21F from the US and planning my first trip abroad and intend on it being to Vietnam. In school I learned a lot about Vietnamese history which caused me to want Vietnam or China as my first location and I settled on Vietnam. 
 Because it’s my first trip I want to be able to spend without much worry shopping and food wise. And be in a semi nice/clean hotel. I also intend to hire a Vietnam local to help with navigation, translation, etc. so a few questions. 
 How much should I budget for hotel? Any suggestions?
 How much should I budget for shopping?
 How much should I budget for bribes/transportation?
 I plan to travel to a popular city and more “normal” aka less touristy city if you have any suggestions. 
 I also plan on paying my guide/new friend around 7 mil vnd each week (plan to stay for 1-3) and I’m not sure if this is sufficient based on the current economy, I would pay for all food, transportation, etc while they are with me. 
 Any other travel suggestions as an early 20s female traveling alone in Vietnam is welcome and thank you in advance.

                              <span>I often hears folks on r/TrochuyenLinhTinh calls Nguyễn Phú Trọng as Trọng lú (Alzheimer Trọng basically).
 It sounds humourous to me, given that he is also quite old, and it draws similarity to Joe Biden, whom also gets called lú by Trump fans as well.
 What is the story behind the infamous name Trọng lú?

 hê lô mí bồ
 tui đang cần tìm các từ đồng nghĩa hoặc cách nói khác của “(không) quan tâm”. ko phải quan tâm theo kiểu chăm sóc mà là quan tâm, để ý những điều người khác nghĩ hoặc nói
 hiện tại tui đang có những từ/cụm từ sau:
 để ý, để tâm, để bụng
 mặc kệ, để ngoài tai, kệ xác, kệ mẹ, kệ bà, kệ mợ, bơ, bơ đi mà sống…
 tui vẫn cần tìm thêm, càng dân dã hoặc càng trẻ trâu thì càng tốt. tui cần tìm nhiều và đa dạng chứ ko cần đúng ngữ cảnh nên có từ nào mí bồ cứ liệt kê hết giùm tui nha
 chỉ có là ko được trộn tiếng Anh nên là mấy cái như đ&#x27; care hay đếch care là hong được. với là tui cần tìm cách nói khác của từ (không) quan tâm chứ ko phải câu thoại thể hiện thái độ không quan tâm nên là cũng ko phải kiểu “nhún vai và nói ’tưởng bố mày quan tâm à?’“
 thanks mí bồ

                              <span>Lần đầu viết bài, văn có lủng củng không hay thì mọi người thông cảm giúp mình nhé. Thật lòng không biết bắt đầu câu chuyện thế nào. Mình năm nay 19 tuổi, sống ở Ninh Bình. Đáng ra giờ này mình đang năm 2 đại học, tuy nhiên vì 1 số biến cố mà mình vẫn đang ở nhà nuôi mộng đại học. Và quãng thời gian này mình đang cảm thấy rất tuyệt vọng, mình có những kế hoạch, và mình sợ nó sẽ mãi không thành hiện thực. Để tập trung vào chuyện học hành thì mình đã bỏ hoàn toàn fb, zalo và các bạn của mình thì đang học đại học. Vì thế nên mình không còn ai để nói chuyện cả, và việc không giao tiếp với ai ngoài gia đình thực sự làm mình suy sụp. 1 số lúc thôi, nhưng lúc nó xảy ra mình không biết ứng phó thế nào. Rất căng thẳng, mình cảm thấy bản thân vô dụng, là 1 thằng ăn bám. Suy nghĩ của mình rất rối. Mình cần người để nói chuyện, tâm sự. Tuy nhiên mình lại nghĩ rằng làm thế để làm gì? Cũng không đạt tác dụng gì cả. Làm thế chẳng khác nào thừa nhận rằng bản thân yếu đuối, phụ thuộc vào người khác. Nó đến tự nhiên và cũng rời đi rất tự nhiên. Giờ tự nhiên mình thấy bình thường rồi. Chắc chỉ đơn giản viết ra suy nghĩ của bản thân là đỡ. Sao cần phải nhờ người khác khi tự giải quyết được nhỉ. Good luck brothers. 
 Tuy nhiên ai có cách hay thì cho vào đây nhé, mình sẽ rất biết ơn.

                              <span>Been here for a a week now and as a solo traveller, Ive been enjoying the solo experience, I often go to eat alone, do activities alone and drink at bar and all sorts of stuff but I never feel lonely at all no ! 
 Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there were moments were I want to share moments but it makes me appreciate humanity and people a lot more. 
 A lot of travellers and locals often become surprised at the fact that I just do things independently and tell me things like &quot; I&#x27;m too scared to be alone&quot; or &quot; Aren&#x27;t you scared?&quot; Or &quot; Where&#x27;s your boyfriend?&quot;. 
 Scared of what ? Scared of not being able to be comfortable in my own skin? I&#x27;d be more afraid of that tbh! 
 The reason why I never feel truly alone or lonely is being I&#x27;m at a state of being where I feel content in the present moment, I want to soak it all up and enjoy the time I have here, I talk to people if I want to connect but I also have this freedom to also experience my inner world with the world outside of me and for the time I have here I want to be able to experience that.
 So for another question, what do the introverts or freespirits do here as well in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hey all, just came back from a 2 week trip in VN and it was amazing. I had a few questions lingering from the trip on my mind, which I wanted to just hear discussion on.
 1) As title states, why is PQ so empty? It reminds me of a nicer Cancun/Cabo and the people are amazing. For some reason there was ZERO people at Grand World when we visited during the day and then it wasn&#x27;t even that busy at night either. The shops seemed fake but they actually had workers when we went in so I&#x27;m still confused.
 2) Is tourism down in VN in general this year? Why is that? A lot of the Grab drivers were letting us hire them for the full day and we would just have to pay the Grab rates(or less) and they didn&#x27;t charge at all for waiting time... (for example if we went to Grand World for 5-6 hours, he would just charge us for the ride there and back)

 tui đang cần tìm cách nói khác của “(không) quan tâm”. ko phải quan tâm theo kiểu chăm sóc mà là quan tâm, để ý những điều người khác nghĩ hoặc nói
 hiện tại tui đang có những cách nói sau:
 để ý, để tâm, để bụng
 mặc kệ, để ngoài tai, kệ xác, kệ mẹ, kệ bà, kệ mợ
 tui vẫn cần tìm thêm, càng dân dã hoặc càng trẻ trâu thì càng tốt. mí bồ biết cách nói nào nữa thì kể giùm tui nha. thanks mí bồ

 Does it have any double meaning or innuendo?

                              <span>Hi all.
 My family and I are planning to visit Phu Quoc for a few days and I&#x27;m looking for the best transportation option.
 The problem is that motorbikes are not an option for 3 out of 4 of us for various reasons (older age, bad eyesight, and no driver&#x27;s license). From what I&#x27;ve gathered, grab/other taxi services aren&#x27;t that common around the island, and renting a car is impossible. But we&#x27;d still like to explore and move around and I&#x27;m getting a bit discouraged by the research I&#x27;ve done so far.
 Is there an option I haven&#x27;t considered yet? Or, maybe my research is wrong? What would be the best transport option for the 4 of us around the island?

Tao cũng xém thực hiện đc 3-4 lần , r, nhưng vợ t vớt 2 lần, mấy lần khác thì chưa đủ can đảm. Từ nhỏ tao đã thiếu tình thương của mẹ tao, bả lo đi làm suốt, bả cứ nghĩ là cho t đủ đầy về mặt vật chất thì xong r, mà tới giờ t vẫn chưa thấy mình đủ đầy về vật chất với tinh thần. Tao còn có một thằng anh, nó phá nhà cửa tới nay mấy tỷ bạc, tao thì biết làm ăn nhưng bả kiềm hãm tao lại, dành tình thương cho nó nhiều hơn tao. Còn tỷ tỷ chuyện nữa mà tao làm biếng nói tiếp, nhưng cái mà tao luôn hoang mang về bản thân tao là t cũng có một số lần mốt giết bả, hoặc tao chết hoặc bả chết, bả ác với tao quá. Không biết đây có phải là do bệnh sinh ra không, vợ tao đang có chữa nữa, tao rối quá.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Recently left Vietnam after back packing through it for 90 days; missing it already. In my last few days in Hanoi before flying out I redownloaded Pokemon Go just to see what&#x27;s up, and on my last day there I caught a Beldum with perfect IVs.
 Now, I learned a little Vietnamese (mostly so I could order food in a restaurant from a Vietnamese menu) but I don&#x27;t exactly have a wide vocabulary. I wanted to nickname that Beldum something Vietnamese and was wondering, for any pokemon fans here, if you have any good ideas for what you might nickname a Metagross.
 Otherwise I&#x27;m gonna be stuck calling the thing &quot;Bánh mì&quot;, and it deserves better.

 September 2023, I spent the entire month in Vietnam. I entered Vietnam from USA on an Evisa that let me stay until December 2023. First I stayed with my family in HCM then spent the rest of the time solo traveling to central and the north. Towards the end of the month I wanted to go Thailand. This is where I messed up. I didn’t pay attention that my original Evisa was for SINGLE ENTRY which I had already used to get into Vietnam originally. I left Thailand on Tuesday September 26 and wanted to come back Saturday September 30. On the Friday before my flight I realized my v…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning a one-week trip to Hanoi in mid-January next year with my parents, who are in their 70s. The tentative plan includes a 2-night stay in Hanoi, followed by a 3-day 2-night cruise at Halong Bay. 
 Any suggestions for other tours or trips outside Hanoi? My parents are healthy but can&#x27;t walk or climb steps for extended periods. We&#x27;re more inclined towards natural scenaries and experiencing local culture than shopping.

I am currently in the US, and it is difficult to find physical copies of Vietnamese books, and I am trying to learn Vietnamese. I would be open to any suggested reading if someone has a better book to read.

I take Remeron and Doxepin and going off those for any length of time is not an option. Are there any exceptions to this rule?

 We will have lots of luggage we need in Japan but don’t want to carry when traveling in Vietnam. What should we do? Japan Airlines said we can’t take our suitcases and send to our Japan address during our layover. I called our hotel in Hanoi and asked if we could courier our luggage to their hotel for 9 days and they said no. Thoughts?

                              <span>Our son recently became friends with a Vietnamese boy in his class. We love him and his family, but his parents do not speak English (despite having lived in the US for several years). 
 Last week, our son had a birthday party and as a gift, they gave him a credit/debit card worth $100. We were flabbergasted. They do not seem like an overtly wealthy family: middle class house, etc. 
 We don&#x27;t know what to do. We are uncomfortable with this gift, but unable to discuss it with them. Of course we would be very tactful if we could, just explaining that it is not the norm in this culture to give such an exorbitant gift. Since they do not speak English after living here for years, we thought perhaps they work in fields where they don&#x27;t need to, and are thus sort of encapsulated in a cultural bubble? 
 Thoughts on this, and how we should approach it? 
 (Also: when they came to drop off/pick up their son from our house, they refused to come inside. Not even into the entryway. And it was cold outside, so I was standing there with the door open while we waited for the kids to come downstairs. I invited them several times. The only thing I can remotely think of is that we have cats, and maybe they&#x27;re allergic?)

                              <span>My spouse has interviewed and been offered a job in HCMC. We were originally thinking 2 years would be the max, and then extend if we like it or move on if we didn’t. The job offer that was received was 3 years. The pay and benefits are good, but he wouldn’t get 2 days off in a row which puts a damper on traveling to other cities to explore. Just wondering what others thoughts are on living in HCMC for an extra year. Would you? Why or why not?

Sorry, i dont have accents on my keyboard. 
 Are any of these correct?

                              <span>I never had real Vietnamese food before, but I found a small restaurant in my neighborhood recently and now it has become my favorite! I usually don&#x27;t eat soups because I find them boring, like the classic veggie or chicken soup that almost everyone makes, or tomato soup, potato soup and so on. They&#x27;re ok, kinda bland sometimes, but nothing special to me. 
 But the first time I tried Pho Bo, it just blew me away, the combination of flavors is just spectacular. Now whenever I go to this restaurant, I always start with a Pho Bo. Then I continue with other stuff like Bahn Mi, Bún chả and others that I forgot their name and struggle to pronounce them, but I&#x27;m trying to learn. I think it&#x27;s good to learn their real names, it&#x27;s a sign of respect and appreciation. 
 I also like that they&#x27;re playing traditional Vietnamese music on speakers, I find it very relaxing. And the people there are also very friendly and hospitable, which makes the whole experience so much better.
 A huge thank you for all the food you bring to the world!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for a month now. Before, I had the impression that it isn&#x27;t really an expensive country.
 I checked per capita income, it isn&#x27;t much. 
 But everyone here has some expensive things that just don&#x27;t make sense. 
 Everyone seems to have iPhone, that too - pro models. Many people here drive expensive cars. Even the grab cabs are relatively good cars.
 But accomodation, hotel stays aren&#x27;t expensive. Food is fair priced.
 So it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. - how much people earn here, on an average? - if people aren&#x27;t earning much, how are they able to afford such expensive things? - what is normal mentality people have regarding finances and savings. Do they spend all they earn? - what is mentality on owning things? Why does everything have extensive phones and cars here?

                              <span>I think some of this explains a lot of the recent posts….
 Not that it matters so much, but I’ve lived in Vietnam the past 20 years, can speak the language, etc. I’m not asking for an appeal to authority, but I have, in my view, earned the right to judge. 
 In terms of the most important parts of culture, Vietnam is a toxic mess that needs to grow up and figure itself out. Now let me qualify that. 
 When you get to know Vietnamese people, they are great. Some of my best friends are Vietnamese. People I would trust with my kids. They’re kind, gentle, caring, and generous. But this is a one-on-one thing. 
 Then there’s the public culture. When the cloak of anonymity drops and no one knows you, people are often vile and selfish. The noise, the littering, the way people drive, elevators, queui…</span>

                              <span>I’ve read a couple of posts/ comments on this sub about experiences of black people in Vietnam. One said that in Vietnam black people are thought to be, aggressive or dirty or unlucky and should expect racism, and not be treated like other tourists, i.e. in a welcoming way. I realise no country is free of racism (some are worse than others) but is it likely to be so apparent that it negatively impacts my experience of Vietnam? If so I would like some insight so I know what to expect.
 I’ve travelled to a handful countries in SE Asia most have friendly locals and I didn’t feel any different to any other travellers. Except in two-ish cases. One country was memorable for people handing me babies to take photos and basically being in a zoo like situation and in another I experienced constant racism, being called a ghost people whispering behind your back, not being served like other people in restaurants etc. The only place I was treated well in that country, was the hotel I stayed at. I plan on going back to the first country because as tiring as that became, after the novelty of being an instant celebrity wore off, the people were not inherently racist just not exposed and they were actually lovely people. The second I will avoid for as long as I can.
 I plan on making the most of this trip either way because I like to experience new places but some insight would be helpful so I can be mentally prepared. It’s a short trip so I’ll only be going to HCMC and Nha Trang. Apart from a few trips to areas near these places, I won’t be venturing anywhere else.

                              <span>So I know this sounds like a stupid question and it might be ahaha but I&#x27;m scottish and I&#x27;ve been away from home for awhile now and I always crave haggis. I&#x27;m literally about to get on a bus to Vietnam tonight and I&#x27;ve found haggis in a shop in Cambodia. I called my dad to tell him about it and he told me it&#x27;s been banned in other countries before?? I&#x27;ve been wanting haggis for so long I think I&#x27;ll cry if I can&#x27;t take it into Vietnam with me lol. I can&#x27;t find anything about it online so I&#x27;m praying someone here can tell me ahaha I know this is silly

 We can draw many parallels.

                              <span>Hey so have many of you guys run into these fake Facebook profiles of attractive Vietnamese women that add you as friends? Then they continue to get to know you and follow up advertising about teaching you crypto and are super pushy about it. I am always suspicious the moment they talk to me but let it play out. I never let it get past that part and just tell them to fuck off. However, I am curious where are they going with those scam? They waste so much time and energy and some of them straight up forget their humanity for the sake of trying to get some easy bucks. They also always pretend to be from Cali but I suspect they are from our homeland because I can’t imagine living in the US and using these dirty tactics to make a living. It is so shameful and embarrassing.

 Any recs on what to do in da nang area while it rains?

                              <span>Hi there everyone,
 I’ll be visiting Hanoi, VN next week, and I’m so excited to explore the city.
 Where can I score good thrift clothes or local clothing brands in Hanoi?
 Where can I find free art galleries in Hanoi?
 Where can we have an affordable yet fancy dinner in Hanoi?
 Where can we find a friendly and nice straight or gay bars/clubs in Hanoi?
 Thank you so much! 🫶🏻🇻🇳

 This was offered by booking.com, not the hotel.
 Do you have any good/bad experience with this &quot;E-Life Limo&quot; service?
 I&#x27;m afraid of scammers that will ask for more money even if booking.com says it&#x27;s free for me.
 I have Grab App and a SIM, so I can easily book a Grab if needed.

                              <span>Hi Guys, This is our 1st international trip after marriage on our 1st anniversary. I have been to Thailand before but since my wife wanted the feel of it, I have included a week. Need suggestions if thats a good idea. Vietnam itinerary- Land in Hanoi on 12th Jan. 3 nights Hanoi/Ha Long and nearby 1 night in train/bus to Da Nang 2 nights in Da Nang 1 night in Hoi An or vice versa 1 night in train/bus to HCMC 2 nights in HCMC
 On 22nd Jan, flight from HCMC to Chiang Mai.
 2nights in Chiang Mai 1 night travel to BKK BKK to Phuket flight 2 nights in Phuket/Krabi Phuket to BKK flight 2 nights in BKK/Pattaya On 29th Jan, Monday, back to India.
 Thailand itinerary is not finalised yet just a rough thought on the above as on my previous trip I have already covered BKK, Pattaya, Phuket, Koh Samui and the full moon party. This trip was before Thailand legalised weed. I am also considering Thailand this time as both of us want to experience the weed culture now along with the new places like Chiang Mai, Krabi etc. Currently i have only booked the departure to Hanoi on 12th Jan, planning to book HCMC- Chiang Mai and BKK to delhi back, by tomorrow. Please help guide if I am doing the right thing.

 31 of us coming to Nha Trang next weekend, on a batchelor party.
 We have booked our venues, but are looking for some different / weird activities we can do to embarrass the groom to be, that would be ok in a restaurant. We dont want anything sexual.
 Any help would be appreciated !

                              <span>I opened a Vietnamese cafe in Philadelphia United States. We sell grilled pork skewers, beef skewers, shrimp skewers, fried rice, shrimp fried rice, seafood fried rice, chicken wings, fish wings, garlic wings, spring rolls. Many of the Vietnamese restaurants here sell phở, mì quảng, bún bò huế and soups. We want to sell food the other restaurants don’t sell. What are some ideas or recipes we can offer that will sell well and be popular? We have a small kitchen space so it’s difficult to offer a lot of different options at the same time. 
 Tôi mở một quán cà phê Việt Nam ở Philadelphia Hoa Kỳ. Chúng tôi bán xiên que nướng, xiên bò, xiên tôm, cơm chiên, cơm chiên tôm, cơm chiên hải sản, cánh gà, cánh cá, cánh tỏi, chả giò. Nhiều nhà hàng Việt Nam ở đây bán phở, mì quảng, bún bò huế và các món súp. Chúng tôi muốn bán đồ ăn mà các nhà hàng khác không bán. Một số ý tưởng hoặc công thức nấu ăn nào chúng tôi có thể đưa ra sẽ bán chạy và được ưa chuộng? Chúng tôi có không gian bếp nhỏ nên khó có thể đưa ra nhiều lựa chọn khác nhau cùng lúc.

                              <span>We bought Viettel sim cards at the airport, assuming that any booths inside the airport were official stores. Our sim cards were simultaneously deactivated after 36 hours. We went to the official Viettel store in Hoi An, and she looked up the sim cards. She said that they were very old and that they were not registered on their network anymore. She also told us to only buy from an official Viettel store, and said that there are no official Viettel stores at Da Nang airport. We had to buy new sim cards (we paid 170k for 2 gigs a day for a month - less than the 240k we paid at the airport). Thankfully we paid with a credit card so we can dispute the charge.

                              <span>Husband and I have just finished visiting the northern region of Vietnam, mainly Hanoi, Cat Ba and Ninh Binh. We are just blown away by this beautiful country and it’s people.
 There’s just so much to see and do in this beautiful country. Only being here for a few days we were so sad to leave but have so much appreciation for the hustle and bustle life of busy cities like Hanoi, as well as the calm and quiet lifestyle of those in Cat Ba.
 The variety of food options available here makes me so embarrassed as a westerner who had only heard about Pho. My favourite meal was when I had a local home cooked meal prepared by the wife of the caption who was taking us on a tour on Ha long bay. 
 Lastly, the people. I have never met such wonderful, accommodating and most admirably hard working individuals in any other place in the world. Some people on this sub say that people nag tourists to buy stuff, but I see that as them working hard to earn their keep. I just feel so much respect and admiration and ashamed at the times I have felt lazy to do my privileged job. 
 So grateful to have had this travelling experience in this beautiful country and can’t wait to be back.

                              <span>You know those donut ladies that are all around Hanoi pushing a baby carriage filled with 3 day old donut holes?
 I&#x27;m wondering - where do they actually get all of the donuts? Like - what&#x27;s the source? 
 The ones they try to sell / force onto me are always so old and stale, but I have a feeling that I&#x27;d really like the fresh ones, if I could find any. 
 Anyone know where they come from? Thanks! :)

                              <span>Just spent my evening at bui vien and absolutely heart breaking to see so many young children being sent out to sell items/blowing fire/begging. Being dragged around by parent or young siblings absolutely tired unable to keep eyes open. We even saw an infant no older that a month old being taken around the loud clubs with her begging mother. WHY is there not a ban in place for children to be on this PARTY street late in the evening?? Why are the vietnam govt allowing these children to be used in this way. I don’t know how people can enjoy there evening seeing the sad reality for these children. My heart breaks for them all.
 EDIT 
 i believe some people have taken this post in the wrong way. What I am wondering is if these children are being used by gangs etc why does the gov not try and minimise children being used in this way in main tourist areas etc

                              <span>I know that cosmetic and self care is something ordinary in Vietnam. I’ve always been curious and wanted to do bloodwork and test my genetics to see what my body needs, is over sufficient or deficient, likelihood of baldness etc. Have anyone done this before and where can this be done if possible.

                              <span>I’m not sure my English is correct. How much should women often “challenge” their Vietnamese partners for wedding?
 Introduction of myself: I am Chinese girl living in Hanoi. My sister and brother-in-law moved their factory here in 2018. I saw them having a good life here . They can afford having kids which is nightmare in China nowadays. So I decided to move and work here. I’m 24 years old, and it’s time to think about serious traditional relationship. My brother in law introduced me his Vietnamese customer. He’s a great and humorous guy. He’s running 3 clothes stores and online shops. We’re having good relationship and I think about marriage. In China, women’s families often expect wedding presents as cash from men. In my home province in China, it’s often 100000 cny (340 million vnd). I don’t expect the same amount in Vietnam. May be our tradition can be different. I’m curious how much I should expect from my future Vietnamese husband.
 I’m ready for marriage life here. My personal finance is good. And I improved my Vietnamese a lot. I can sing See Tinh well 😁. It’s very easy for Chinese to pronounce Vietnamese words.

 What is the process to get an apostille stamp for my Vietnamese document in Vietnam?

All suggestions Much appreciated Thank you!

 I&#x27;ve been working as an English teacher in Vietnam for the past (almost) 2 months.
 My boss showed me a contract at the beginning but I never actually signed anything. I am trying to look for new work because she &#x27;fired&#x27; me like a month ago?? But I&#x27;ve still been working for her??
 Basically, she told me at first that the company can&#x27;t keep me because they can&#x27;t afford teachers and I&#x27;m not good enough. But then she said I could stay at the accommodation while I find new work.
 Then when a new company showed interest, she told me I can&#x27;t change over because I&#x27;ll get the company in trouble? She explained that she has to cancel my visa first. The agent says I need a letter from my bo…</span>

                              <span>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be any escaping the huge gangs of Chinese in danang. 
 Twice today, once in a beautifully quiet pho restaurant, sat down, then suddenly a huge coach outside and in they flocked accompanied with a shouting tour guide armed with a flag, table barged into, bag on the floor knocked over, coughing whilst walking past no hand over mouth, loud noise for the next miserable 20 minutes. Then later on the beach, all calm, and along come a huge flock of about 40 of them, walking literally right next to me even though there&#x27;s so much space, yelling at each other. Wtf is going on?! Lol. Can Chinese people travel alone or in couples or is it a government rule by the ccp that they must travel in large flocks of minimum 50 and cause maximum impact wherever they go... Just curious.... Don&#x27;t see any other nationalities travelling like this....

                              <span>I just came from Tokyo where I would sing karaoke and have a great time. It was fun. It was lovely. People bonding over music and enjoy life in karaoke bars/rooms in noisy areas like Kabukicho, far from residental areas.
 Just came back to Vietnam, a country that is the complete opposite of Japan in every way imaginable and I swear it sounds like someone is running a duck over with a lawnmower every time they pick up a microphone. I&#x27;m no Freddie Mercury by any means, but it has to be something in the water here making people tone-deaf.
 I just got to my girlfriend&#x27;s house, she has been really sick for a week, and despite knowing that the neighbors have been playing karaoke nonstop. Extremely selfish? Yes. But, I&#x27;m currently listening to what sounds like a roadkill dying and I want to stab my eardrums out with chopsticks.
 How is this legal? In every other place I&#x27;ve ever lived, the police would shut this tragedy of a performance down asap. Is it the way the language sounds or are people supposed to sound like they&#x27;re drowning when they sing? Can we get a petition going to forever ban karaoke machines within a 4km radius of any city?

                              <span>In one of my jobs I&#x27;m a sort of middle manager at an international school. On several occasions, I&#x27;ve seen dudes with higher-up positions neck-massaging pretty ladies in the office. Is this seen as normal in Vietnamese society?
 It feels uncomfortable to me and it looks unprofessional, but I&#x27;ve never complained about it. Should I neck massage my subordinates to fit in with the culture? lol I wonder how wives feel about this.

                              <span>What a waste of money. I have BAC debit card and withdraw money from VPBank (blue logo), the one that do not have 50,000vnd fees. First, American Bank took $5 for each transaction + 3% and I believe there was also not the best convert rate. 
 What a waste. 
 VPBank was only gave option to withdraw 2,000,000 vnd at once. Tried to change for 5,000,000, withdraw,-- didn&#x27;t worked.

                              <span>Hello Friends,
 My dad is currently very sick with terminal cancer and lives with me in Canada outside of Vietnam. He has a Sacombank bank account with a decent amount of money in it, but it’s “locked in” as it was an interest generating account. 
 Due to his illness, he will not be able to travel back to Vietnam to do any banking as he’s very sick. Is there anything we can do to unlock the account so he can move funds to our country (Canada)? He’s under the belief the banks need him physically there but he’s in nope shape to travel.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am travelling to Vietnam for 5 days in the last week of January. We are group of 3/4 people and have short listed Ninh Binh and Hanoi as places to visit. We are landing in Hanoi, that’s why. Haven’t booked the tickets yet. 
 So, do you all think it’s wise to cover these two places in 5 days? We want to stay for at least 2 days in Ninh Binh as well not just one day tour there. 
 Would really appreciate your guidance on what places we should must go considering the short span of time in both cities. 
 Is it a wise decision to cover both places or should we stick to one place only? 
 Thanks for you help and suggestions in advance!

                              <span>Please recommend tours from Hanoi to Halong Bay and back. I want something cozy, not over crowded, could include some activities as cooking Vietnamese food, kayaking. I want to experience this place without chaotic environment.

I&#x27;m sort of dumb so not super lyric heavy would be the best. A point in the right direction would be great. Thanks!

 I’m looking to go from Hanoi to Vientiane in around a week with a few friends. I’ve seen some flights but they’re quite expensive. 
 Is there a sleeper bus available or no? I can’t seem to find much online. Would appreciate any help :)
