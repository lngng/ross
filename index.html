                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m a second-gen Viet American, which of course comes with its own set of deep cognitive dissonance. 
 I&#x27;m quite proud of my culture and celebrate it openly, and I&#x27;m also very lucky to have grown up in an area with strong Viet communities. As I went into high school, as a reaction to dismal education on the history of the Vietnam war, I did a lot of reading on my own and was pretty surprised by how different it was to my parent&#x27;s accounts. 
 Of course I understood my parents went through unimaginable hardships during the war, I absolutely don&#x27;t dismiss their personal experiences. I think it&#x27;s common for Viet-American kids to be raised being told that HoChiMinh is an evil, genocidal man and that the communist party is the worst thing ever.

                              <span>I’ll be traveling to Vietnam in two weeks. I’ll be in Saigon, Da Nang/Hoi An, and Hanoi (and the surrounding area perhaps). I am not on a backpacker budget but I figure for most of the trip there is still no reason to spend anymore than like 1,000,000 VND (30-40 USD) a night because the rooms are nice enough at that price. 
 But, this trip is somewhat of a celebration (just finished law school and took the bar) so at least once in the trip I would like to splurge, by Vietnamese standards, and get a really nice room. I guess like 3,500,000 VD (150 USD) a night. 
 I was thinking this would be best done in Da Nang because it’s on the beach and it’ll will be a pretty relaxing part of my trip. It didn’t seem necessary to spend too much in Saigon because I’ll be out and about all day and basically just sleeping at the hotel. 
 So, does this line of thinkingmake sense, and if so, can anyone recommend some more upscale places that you’ve had good experiences at? Would like a nice pool and bar area, good food, service, etc… 
 Open to this stuff in Saigon and Hanoi as well just like I said, doesn’t seem as worth it as Da Nang but open to being proved wrong. Thanks!

I could just drink that like soup, and I did.. haha I&#x27;m looking for a recipe for hanoi style bun cha sauce, I&#x27;ve seen so many recipes and I feel like most of them focus mostly on the meat preparation but I&#x27;m obsessed with the sauce I would love you input, maybe some family recipes?! Thank you:)

I didnt have the best experience the last time I went but im looking forward to traveling here again. I adore Vietnamese food (im SE asian too) and i wanted to ask if locals have any suggestions for restaurants and Vietnamese food I should try (aside from the usual pho and banh mi). Appreciate any suggestions 😊

                              <span>I am travelling to Vietnam with a friend as an adult for the first time, and I need all the advises I could get. I know that we need to get an evisa to enter the country, but if we are heading out in mid-October, when should I apply for the visa? Also, can I use the same visa to leave back to USA? We will be there in October, so what will the weather be like? What would you guys recommend to pack, buy/bring? What are some places you guys recommend for us to visit? We are open to everything, but super excited to do some shopping (clothes/skincare/makeup,) food places, entertainments, and spa/massage etc. We&#x27;ll be staying in Saigon around Binh Thanh if it helps! Also, if there is any apps that would be useful for my travel, I would greatly appreciate it. FINALLY, please let me know what to avoid, and what are some well-known scams to look out to. Thank you in advance!

 Open to any suggestions.

                              <span>I’ll be going to Vietnam for the month of September with my boyfriend. This is not a hiking vacation, but we will do some touristy things I’m sure. He’s viet and I’m American, but he moved when he was a child and I can’t figure out what to wear and he’s not much help. Some people tell me just normal clothes, some tell me very modest attire. I know it’s hot and humid, so no way I’ll wear any jeans. Are tennis skirts ok? Should all dresses and skirts be ankle length? Is it offensive to see shoulders? I don’t want to offend anyone, but I also want to be comfortable.

                              <span>Currently there&#x27;s been a lot of Vietnam bashing on behavior but it&#x27;s really unfair. Most middle class Vietnamese people don&#x27;t have the behaviors people come here to vent about. 
 I&#x27;m curious, is there a high society movement? Do people use the term &quot;high soc&quot; here?Are vietnamese trying to differentiate themselves as high society from low society? In Thailand all you hear is high soc low soc everywhere especially with the rich parents of the students.

                              <span>I’m Vietnamese but born in Australia. Apologies for my ignorance but I need some perspective. My family said Vietnam dislike China and I want to get perspective from those who are living in VN atm. I’ll be visiting Vietnam in September for the first time with my husband. He is Malaysian Chinese who is also born in Australia. He has an Australian passport but his surname is very chinese. Will he get targeted for bribes at the airport? $20 is not much for us but it’s the principle. My dad said that they don’t usually target younger people but I saw a few people here mentioning that they do. I can’t wait to visit my motherland but a bit nervous as I don’t know what to expect.

                              <span>chào mn, gần đây thì mn đã nghe nhiều về những drama xung quanh hoa hậu rồi nhỉ?
 mình thực sự không biết tác dụng của hoa hậu là gì.
 sắc đẹp là thứ từ khi được sinh ra đã nhận được, không cần qua rèn luyện thì có gì để thi thố và tự hào nhỉ. tự hào về thứ được ban cho ?, pttm tí cũng đẹp lên ngay ấy mà.
 nếu thi hoa hậu phải biết ứng xử thì thi mấy cuộc thi hùng biện cũng được mà nhỉ :v , thậm chí họ còn làm tốt hơn ấy chứ.

 Can I pay in cash or does it have to be only card? Does international credit card (VISA) work? Does it automatically convert from VND —&gt; USD when charged?
 I already let the bank know I am going to be in Vietnam. 
 Appreciate any advice, thank you!!!

                              <span>Thứ nhất: Mấy người vi phạm giao thông thì đã là người sai rồi. Mỗi năm có hàng triệu người chết vì tai nạn giao thông, mà đa phần là do những nguyên nhân hoàn toàn có thể phòng tránh được. Mấy người vi phạm thì tức là đang tăng rủi ro tai nạn lên cho bản thân và người khác, đến lúc tai nạn tàn phế ra thì ai cứu, chỉ còn biết than trời chứ làm thế nào được?
 Thứ hai: Csgt ăn đút lót thì chính mấy người vi phạm là người đút lót, csgt lỗi 10 thì mấy người cũng lỗi 7-8. Giả sử bạn vi phạm, bị vẫy lại, thay vì xin ghi biên bản, nộp bằng lái nộp phạt, thì lại chọn đút lót cho csgt hứa em không sai nữa, và rồi về chửi là csgt ăn hối lộ? Mà nếu các ông nghĩ mình không sai bị ăn tiền láo thì làm mẹ biên bản đi cho nó chuẩn chứ rén à mà hối lộ? Khó hiểu? Xong giả sử gặp ông csgt chuẩn, nhất quyết không nhận hối lộ thì lại lên mạng cào phím nhà nước phạt lắm tiền hút máu dân à?
 Tất nhiên tôi không cổ vũ cho hành động ăn hối lộ của csgt, hai cái sai thì không làm nên một cái đúng. Chỉ là nếu mọi người có ghét csgt thì hãy tìm lý do khác như kiểu gặp mấy thằng cảnh sát hách dịch, thái độ hà hiếp dân chẳng hạn, chứ tự người vi phạm đút lót để cho qua chuyện mà giờ lại chửi csgt ăn tiền thì nó vô lý.
 P/s: bình thường thì &quot;thằng cảnh sát&quot;, &quot;chó vàng&quot;, &quot;pikachu&quot; nhưng lúc ăn nhậu hay vặn quá tay ga bị vẫy thì chìa mấy trăm ra gọi &quot;anh cảnh sát&quot; ngọt xớt :)

Would it be raining the entire day? And would Ninh Binh still be enjoyable even though it’s raining? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi my friends, would love to travel maybe even live in vietnam for a while but I might have a disease called celiac. it’s basically when even small amounts of gluten make you severely sick it is causing inflammation in your body and much more.
 I used to love vietnamese food here in germany but from my knowledge most of the dishes contain gluten at least here.
 Are there many dishes without gluten? is gluten free easily accessible on the country side? 
 It’s actually so severe that I have to be careful going to restaurant because if someone prepares a meal with gluten ona table and then prepares a gluten free meal on it that might be enough for me to react and get glutened.
 advice will be appreciated &lt;3

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to preface my rant - I&#x27;m Vietnamese. Living in western culture my whole life. Travelled extensively all around the world. I got enough of a perspective.
 I don&#x27;t follow the sub closely, but lately I can&#x27;t help but notice the posts where the OP is really dumbfounded that a totally different Asian culture with a heavy history has it&#x27;s ways in day-to-day life and views?
 To me it looks like the certain disdain and irritation as in &quot;Why you guys aren&#x27;t like Bali, where the culture is all so westernized and easy for us to consume?&quot;
 It seems so natural for me that when facing a different culture and especially in a developing country I am very respectful and accepting of the way they are. Instead of being on a high moral ground and in a position of a consumer, I try to get to know the people, the culture and be thankful that I&#x27;m being welcomed to their home.
 UPD. Since people get confused about what I&#x27;m trying to say. There are things that are deeply rooted in the culture of a nation. That&#x27;s the &quot;otherness&quot; that people may or may not appreciate, but that&#x27;s unique to every culture.
 There are problems that arise from socio-economical background and are pretty common in Asia and all around the developing countries. Those are things no Vietnamese is proud of but we are on the track of dealing with them.

                              <span>Van den Brink said, &quot;We front-loaded our pricing. We ran into a pretty strong economic slowdown in the key market of Vietnam, which is disproportionately important to us.&quot;
 This is from the recent earnings report. Is Vietnam really experiencing an economic slowdown like this CEO said?

                              <span>As I start to write this, it is my last night in Vietnam. I spent the last week at the youngest great aunt’s apartment where my 2nd cousin lives too. My 2nd cousin and I are the same age. I spend tonight like many nights before laying in the living room bed in the dark with multiple fans spinning and wondering how life could have been different. I wonder how life would have been like if the roles were reversed.
 17 years ago, I was 13-14 years old and visited Vietnam for the first time with my grandma and uncle and his wife. I spent a month in Vietnam and do not remember much but I do remember meeting the youngest great aunt and my 2nd cousin. I have happy and memorable memories with them. I remember meeting my great uncle who had a mental illness. He was locked in a jail bar room for his …</span>

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s a personal choice to eat how you want. And some foreigners also eat with the putrid sound of wet mushy food smacking back and forth while eating with their mouth open.
 But I find it to be much more common here in Vietnam. 
 To me, it&#x27;s one of those sounds that rattle my insides. Similar to someone rubbing a balloon or scraping on a chalk board. 
 I&#x27;m sitting at a coffee shop now and a couple just sat next to me and they are both mouth smacking their food for the past 10 minutes or so. Even putting my earbuds in and putting the volume high. I can still hear it
 I know others also find this sound irritating. And it&#x27;s obvious that people are able to eat without opening their mouths all the way 500 times during a meal and showing everyone the visuals and sounds of the first steps of the human digestion process
 I don&#x27;t say anything. I&#x27;m not being a Karen. But it&#x27;s absolutely disgusting. Why don&#x27;t friends say anything to these people? Or literally nobody cares and it&#x27;s enjoyable to eat a meal with these people as they make some of the most unappetizing noises? Why so common here in Vietnam? Like, the louder you eat your food, the richer you are? It brings you good luck or something? 
 Nasty noises from your mouth keep the ghosts away maybe? 👻

                              <span>Hi everyone! My partner and I have slowly started to look into potential baby names as we want to start a family soon. For reference, I am European Australian while my partner was born and raised in Vietnam. Any children we have will most likely grow up in Australia, though will frequently visit Vietnam to see family. We want to choose a first name that can easily be used in both Australia and Vietnam.
 We have been looking into Western first names that when shortened also sound like a Vietnamese name (this would be their nickname and also what they are called when in Vietnam). For example:
 (F) Maia (shortened to Mai) / (F) Maysie (shortened to May) / (M) Vincent (shortened to Vinh).
 Do you guys think this is too weird? 😅 Can you think of any other names like this?
 Otherwise, we were thinking of using a Vietnamese first name that is easy for English speakers to pronounce. Does anyone have any ideas?
 Opinions and advice would be great, thank you 😊
 Edit: We are mostly struggling with male names, though recommendations for female names would also be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Me and my girlfriend will be traveling to Vietnam from end of August till mid September (23 days).
 We came up with the following itinerary: 
  
Ho Chi Minh
 
Hoi An 
 
Lang Co Beach 
 
Hué 
 
Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park
 
Nih Binh - Trang An 
 
Hanoi 
 
Sa Pa / Fansipan or Ha Long Bay (depending how we feel)
 
 You think this is viable? Or did we plan too much? Your input is very much appreciated!

                              <span>I just got back to the States and have been super depressed because I’m not in Vietnam anymore. I miss the cheap food, my family, the vibes, technically everything you can think of. But that’s just life I guess, back to responsibilities and jobs. Genuinely can’t wait until I can go back 😂😭

                              <span>Probably we all know Vietnamese people get really uncomfortable with public displays of affection (kissing, hugging,…). I’m curious about how family members show love in their daily life. 
 I (30F) don’t remember the last time I gave my parents hugs or said “I love you” to them. I love them dearly, but it feels really awkward for me to say loving words or be affectionate toward them. 
 In our nuclear family, we give each other big hugs and say “I love you” every single day. My kids would get very upset if I forgot to do those things before rushing to work. 
 My parents at their 70s don’t sleep together anymore, and I never heard them say “I love you” to each other. I feel bad for them. I really wanna give my parents some support but there’s always an invisible wall between me and them that I find it so difficult to break. 
 I wonder if my situation is typical in Vietnamese culture or is it just my family background? My parents rarely say sweet words, always try to suppress their feelings and emotions (except for anger and frustrations 😑). They show their love by attentive care and share.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I’ll be traveling to Ho Chi Minh City in September with my boyfriend and his family from the United States. 
 My boyfriend grew up there until he was about 8 years old then he moved here. He has a self admittedly very limited knowledge of the culture, things to see, norms etc. but he and his sister keep giving me the idea that I’ll hate it there and be very uncomfortable; the food will be shocking, pickpocketers, massive pests, domestic abuse, and lots of personal judgment of me based on how I react but they aren’t able to give me much specific advice of how to behave
 I don’t want to go into this 2 week long trip with a negative attitude, so what are some things to look forward to on my trip? I know it’s a beautiful place with lots to see but I just don’t know where to begin with all of these warnings about how bad it is
 Additionally, what are some cultural norms I should know about to make sure I don’t offend anyone, get lost or put in a bad situation when I don’t know the language?

I stop momentarily to look at my shoe and assess the situation and this guy just starts trying to untie my shoelace!
 I swiftly moved on when he started doing this but I&#x27;m still quite confused about this interaction. I don&#x27;t see what objective the man had in mind by doing this as obviously any sensible person is just going to respond to this by walking (or running) away. Can anyone enlighten me as to what was going on here? Could there have been anything particularly offensive about my shoes that warranted this behaviour?

                              <span>Having lived in Vietnam and other parts of asia for quite a while, there is one topic which is quite difficult to understand ; real estate and its pricing.
 My general observations to date :
 - Generally, land is highly sought after for both investment, speculation and living. They&#x27;re seen as an appreciating asset. Prices are eyewateringly high in major urban centers by global standards. Value is not in the home on the land (often knocked down quickly), but rather in the land itself
 - Condominiums are depreciating assets ; as they age, new projects pop up, generally the price tends to go down over time. That said, there are those who hope to buy a project off-plan (eg. before it is built), and then resell it by the time it is competed hoping to make money (arguably also speculation)
 - Foreigners face restrictions (cannot own land without complicated workarounds), and for condominiums must buy from a specific pre-allocated set of units in certain projects, which stays below a threshold (I believe 49%). Then there&#x27;s the leasehold structure of 50 years which may impact the sale-ability
 Would love to get input on whether this is right, what I&#x27;ve missed and what more there is to this.I still have lots of questions, such as :
 - Are vietnamese subject to the leasehold structure?
 -How firm ones individual rights are in the case the Govt plans some project that impacts ones residence?
 - To what extent is there predictability to the prices or if its just a FOMO (fear of missing out) speculation frenzy?- If condominiums generally depreciate, then is it really a worthwhile financial investment?
 -How are land prices set? is it wild west or is there a government appraisal / pricing process? if so, how come land prices even in fairly rural places are higher per square meter than for example, London?

                              <span>I hate that shit when I was a kid. Literally the most toxic thing to discuss about. Made me and many other people feel like shit and awkward. I don’t know why this became the norm. It’s like they think that because we’re kid, we don’t have feelings and don’t feel sad when adult talk down on us and compared us to other people. I know that in Vietnamese culture, respecting adults is utmost important even when what they are doing is wrong, which is probably why it has been happening for so long. Just imagine asking them back “well why aren’t you as successful and better shape than Chu Ut? You had more time than me at being successful, why are you comparing me to other kids?” Definitely will get the stick for that haha.

                              <span>Yesterday there was a post about Born Pink’s concert stadium filled with trash after the concert had finished. There were alot of people who defended it using excuses such as: “Oh all concerts are like that everywhere.”, “they paid big buck for the tickets, they had the right to use the service.”,etc.
 Well, here’s a few examples of Vietnam’s beautiful natural landscapes ruined by trash because the people don’t give a shit about policing their trash.

                              <span>Some examples I picked up of the common vehicles:
 Honda PCX150 is 70 million in Vietnam and the PCX160cc ABS model is 47 million.
 Honda Jazz is 700 million in Vietnam and in Indonesia, it&#x27;s 416 million. That&#x27;s a difference of almost 300 million.
 Is there a big used vehicles market? Is it worth buying a used vehicle? If yes, what&#x27;s the best place to search it as Facebook marketplace isn&#x27;t commonly used here
 Are their brands that I should opt for instead of paying such a high premium that are perhaps taxed less in Vietnam like Vinfast or something similar?

                              <span>Heading to Hanoi this Fri (4th Aug) and we planned to head to Sapa for the next 2 nights (5th to 7th Aug).
 However looking at the weather forecasts (indications of heavy thunderstorms), I am wondering if it&#x27;s going to be worthwhile or are we better off staying in Hanoi and doing day trips to Ninh Binh etc. or even do Ha Long Bay. Besides the weather I am also concerned if the roads will be safe - we have booked a shared minibus (those that can seat 7 to 8) which will take 5hrs each way to/fro Sapa - any advice appreciated!

                              <span>Viet couple here. We went shooting in Pattaya. To be honest, shooting in Cu Chi Tunnels was much more fun, you got to shoot stuffs from WW2 even, and free to use your phone to record. In Thailand you can&#x27;t take any photo or video, and they charged 300 baht (210k VND) for 5 photoes and vids.

 A depiction of me dying a little inside wkwkwk
 TL;DR: Surely it must be possible to have short simple Vietnamese sentences that don&#x27;t sound and look all the same to a beginner?
 Hi, so, I started learning Vietnamese via Duolingo recently... DL is really not known for teaching you words in a logical order and often giving you weird starter examples but VN version is next-level to me. Sometimes it teaches certain really random words. Like starting with things like ong (bee) for Vietnamese. Mhh OK... Anyway, Indonesian is similar but it&#x27;s still great for daily vocabulary practice :)
 But I wonder... Is this what I will have to learn to read for real? I seriously feel like Duolingo curriculum creators are fucking with you in the first few lessons. Like why would you pick the name of the main antagonist to be An, and then you have your first sentences to be stuff like An ăn anh ấy. I&#x27;m making this example up because I forgot the exact ones, but the early samples have something like this where it&#x27;s just non-stop an&#x27;s and as a beginner you&#x27;re just like.... Mother of God LOL cmon bro.
 I feel like they legit put the most unfavorable sentences at the start to make you question if you want to learn the language O_o. I know that due to tones you can easily have many words that look the same but... It seems so unrealistic to me to have simple sentences in literally the beginner section and then teach something like &quot;Con cá cắn cái ca&quot;... I feel like they do this on purpose LMAO... Am I just imagining things or should I just get used to being massively confused at the start of learning Vietnamese :D?

                              <span>Context, I am Vietnamese but have spoken english for most of my adult life. So, I have limited ability to converse with my mum in Vietnamese. There are people in USA who are Vietnamese with children also of Vietnamese descent. Those children are demanding their parents purchase a Tesla for them, so they can learn to drive. I am looking for Vietnamese words to describe spoilt and self-entitled brats who have no clear thought of the struggles their ancestors went through. Google&#x27;s translate is tự cho mình quyền doesn&#x27;t cut it at all. Help please 🙏

                              <span>We&#x27;re on a family holiday in vietnam and my sister has tall and natural red hair. Everywhere we go Viet people (mainly women) want to take pictures with her. Is there a particular reason for this or is it just because it is rare in Vietnam?

                              <span>I’ll be in Hanoi, Dalat, and Saigon (beginning tomorrow) and would love to pick up a pound of Vietnamese coffee beans. Do coffee shops sell whole beans? Should I pick up a bag at Highlands (or is that like going to Starbucks and getting a bag in the US to being elsewhere?) Are there smaller brands to support and where can I buy them?

                              <span>I entered a one way road by mistake while I was following google maps. There was no signage and the cops caught me. I expected a 500.000vnd maximum fine, but they took away my license and told me to pay 3Million or they won&#x27;t return it. 
 I tried telling them it&#x27;s way too much but the cop outright said if I keep asking him to reduce the fine, he&#x27;ll revoke my license. He wasn&#x27;t even ready to accept my reason. 
 I didn&#x27;t have that much cash so he told me to call a friend and ask or to go to the ATM and get it.
 Do I need to pay this much money every time they stop me? I&#x27;m a foreigner and I&#x27;m new to Hanoi. This was a horrible experience. I understand that they take bribes but 3mil was over the top!

                              <span>I enjoy doing things around the house like putting up shelves and redecorating rooms etc. Where I&#x27;m from almost everyone does. I don&#x27;t get a sense that Vietnamese people do this very much, but thought I&#x27;d ask.

                              <span>Just for context, my family are southerner and we immigrated to the US around 1970s to 2000s and I was always taught by my family that southern Vietnamese are often nicer and easier to hangout with when compared to the northern region. Based on my own experience and experience from my family, this is often true. My dad told that Northerner struggled a lot before and after the war and so they have to work hard to make money and get fed, and that often can translate to behavior of taking advantage of other people. What are your guys experience about this? Not trying to start any fights, just curious if this is something that people can generally agreed on or just a lens from my own experience and not neccesary apply to many others.

                              <span>What is the reality of finding a job in VN for an American ? My wife is Vietnamese and recently floated the idea of moving back VN ( Ho Chi Minh City )so her parents can help us raise our daughter. I don’t speak Vietnamese. I’m guessing I’d be better off finding seasonal work in the US and see my family part time ? This is all hypothetical at the moment.

                              <span>I know, it’s been discussed many times, but i am curious to hear it from the latest visitors. Is a Ha Long Bay cruise worth it? On one hand there’s a nice experience with good views ( as they say) - one another hand theres a 150€ price tag per person, rumors of tons of floating trash that ruins everything, lots of cruises that crowd the area, and it gets boring after a while? What is your experience, thanks

                              <span>Did I offend a bellhop?
 I was traveling with my family and allowed a bellhop to carry our bags into our room. Me and my wife stayed in our rooms and my children in another room. He gave us our luggage and my children tipped him 10,000 dong. At the time it was all we had to tip so we just left it at that. Strangely enough my children found the tip money slipped under their room door.
 Did the bellhop return it out of distaste that it was too little or any other reason? From what I can recall tipping is not mandatory and I thought that amount was better than nothing. Thoughts?
 *Edit: Thank you everyone for your input. I could understand it could be bc the tip came from my children and accepting it was against some moral code or out of pity. It also could be possible that he thought the tip was way too low; Ill never know unless I hear it from him.
 *It is very interesting to hear everyones opinion about tipping as well. I do believe that extraordinary service should be rewarded, but if a tip is given, it should be a worthwhile amount.

                              <span>Long story short, my parents didn’t teach me vietnamese well in my childhood because they were scared I would have an accent when speaking english. I know basic vietnamese, especially when listening, but I’m horribly anxious to speak it. I’ve bought books and flashcards and courses and still have been having trouble learning, partly because I’m used to the southern dialect, which conflicts with a lot of resources on learning the language. Are there any tricks to learning vietnamese? I want to be able to visit vietnam and speak fluently and not look like some americanized idiot.

                              <span>I actually don&#x27;t give a shit about VN any more than any SEA country (although VN is lovely) but I can&#x27;t but notice all the anti-VN posts lately, and it&#x27;s weird for someone in SEA to hear complaints of:
 - Bad driving
 - Litter
 - Selfishness ?
 - Rats
 - Game shows
 - Toilets (paper)
 - Social Toxicity
 What&#x27;s going on? The last week this sub has faced a steady stream of complaints that VN has the same problems of all SEA nations. What&#x27;s happened? Did everyone decide to do on holiday to VN and then moan about it? Or has reddit decided to bombard me with silly posts.
 I&#x27;m really confused, what&#x27;s happening in this sub? I follow this sub to keep up to date with things in VN. I&#x27;m not that interested in complaints about the traffic and TBH I have no idea who is so shocked that traffic in a SEAsian nation is awful.
 IDK. Maybe I&#x27;m out of touch
 Eddit: And the next post I see is someone complaining about stomach upset from the local diet

I swear every time I turn them on, people on the game show are loud asf, thinking their jokes are funny when they say it out loud at 100000000 decibel. Moreover, why are there so many of them and they mostly have the same MC and directors?

                              <span>Hey guys! So my son will be born in a month. My wife and I have bought a lot of stuff but I was just reading on another Reddit page about how a lot of stuff you really don’t need to buy new and you can find the majority of what you need on “buy nothing” groups, especially since a lot of the stuff is used for such a short term that it’s still practically new anyways. 
 I searched on Facebook hoping to find a local group like that in HCMC and…nothing. Can’t say I’m surprised tbh 😂 but then again, maybe I wasn’t looking hard enough? Please let me know if you are aware of a group like that for my area. Thanks guys!

                              <span>It’s always a me-first attitude. You try to get out of an elevator, you have to avoid getting trampled by the people who bully their way into the elevator first. You try to cross a road, no one cares, they try to gun their motorbike to beat you there first. You try to walk into a narrow doorway and the person next to you does everything in their power to bullrush past you to get through first. No manners in this culture. I hate visiting here.

                              <span>So some of you probably heard of the shitstorm the influencer Thao Ni Le is going through at the moment. Although it’s nothing new at all that these internet celebs jump on any topic that promises to be generating clicks and views, it’s somehow still mind boggling to me that a Viet Kieu (from Germany) coming to Vietnam, rises to fame here, and then learning absolutely nothing about Vietnam’s history and touches a topic that’s highly sensitive here. While on holidays. Via Instagram. 
 So my question is: What do you think about Viet Kieus coming to Vietnam and claiming to be genuine Vietnamese (obviously for career moves) and is the general public aware of that behavior?

 I&#x27;ll be moving to Hanoi soon, and was hoping someone could help suggest a great health club in Hanoi with access to a gym, pool, steam room, sauna (and cherry on the top - ice bath!) Does such a gym exist? And, if so, what would the rates be?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I’m a Korean American expat based in South Korea the past 16 yrs. For the first time, my Korean native gf, her brother, and I visited Ho Chi Minh for a week July 22-28. I know the saying is visiting and living are two different things.. 
 Nonetheless, we had a blast. Stayed in an Airbnb at Vinhomes Central Park and went to a good mix of touristy foodie spots many near Ben Thanh Market and to local spots around the city where we couldn’t use any English to order. 
 We were quite surprised by the weather temperatures as we were expecting hot weather similar to Thailand but it was rather cool the entire time. It’s actually hotter and more humid in Korea right now.
 Never visited Bui Vien Walking street as my gf and I aren’t heavy party-goers or drinkers (I’m in my early 40’s and she’s in her late 30’s and we’ve had our fair share of debauchery in our 20’s and early 30’s). Her brother was keen on checking it out but we just never made it.
 The only thing I wish I was able to check out is the bjj/mma/combat sports scene as I’ve been training myself the last 9 yrs in Korea. Saw a few bjj gyms I wanted to check out but also didn’t want to be selfish and take away from the time I should be spending with my gf and her brother. Am curious as to what the scene is like in Vietnam if anyone that trains would care to share.
 Here are some photos of our trip as well. A bunch of the cliché touristy spots. I’m also a photographer so I prefer shooting with my dslr rather than a phone and edited the photos in my editing style which might not be the best or most realistic representation of the places. But these the ones I’ve shared to my sns. 
 We absolutely loved Ho Chi Minh and are keen to visit Hanoi the next time we make it back.
 Been lurking in this sub the last week to gain insight into this fascinating country and would love to hear any and all experiences, both good and bad, from those actually living here if anyone cares to share.

                              <span>What does a real &quot;local&#x27;s&quot; party look like? My wife is Colombian and thinks that Vietnamese people don&#x27;t really party...they only drink beers and sing karaoke at home...All the clubs in the cities are for Westerners playing the same stupid songs over and over... Are there real Vietnamese dance parties? Huge clubs or events where people dance, drink, laugh, and get sweaty all night? If so, where?! What type of music are people dancing to? What districts do these things happen in? Are there any good videos of the party scenes?

                              <span>I was at night market. Went to the clothing shop. Two ladies were bargaining for something. And one of them was repeating &quot;Give me for 210 and I&#x27;m gonna leave you alone&quot; many times. Dude was fixed at 250. But they were pushing him so hard to go for 210. Also they were talking in English very fast. So he couldn&#x27;t understand anything except number 210. I mean I know you can bargain but isn&#x27;t it too much? Or is it pretty common to haggle at that level?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 so I got addicted to coconut coffee, and especially the roasted (I think) coconut pieces on the top of it. Anyome knows what its called, and if I can buy that in shops? I will be eternally grateful, and pay for your first 5 beers in Hanoi or HCM.

                              <span>My grandmother recently passed away in February. I wasn’t very close to her, but my family asked if my mom and I were going back to Vietnam next year for my grandmother’s first death anniversary. My mom definitely intends on visiting for 3 weeks, and she asked me if I can request work off to go with her (for 2-3 weeks). I currently work at a ski resort, and February is our busiest time of the year. To be honest, I don’t really want to go. I feel uncomfortable staying with my family for various reasons; I would also be going from below freezing now in high elevation to a humid tropical climate, but most of all I always feel anxious around my Mom. I had also been talking about and planning a trip with my partner to go to Italy for a week in March, so I’m not even sure if I’d be allowed to take that much time off in such a short amount of time. My mom says the first death anniversary is very important, so would I be ostracized by my family if I don’t go?

For now I&#x27;m just watching YouTube videos and practicing my vocabulary on Duolingo, what are some useful words / sentences I should know? Curse words, slang, stuff like that?

                              <span>Khoảng 8 năm trở lại đây mình thấy MV Việt chất lượng càng ngày càng tăng (từ hồi có Sơn Tùng?). MV có đầu tư, sáng tạo, xem rất đã, cảm thấy chả thua gì mấy nước giầu, ăn đứt mấy nước khác trong khu vực (trừ Thái Lan). Chắc có một phần nhờ camera bây giờ rẻ, phần mềm chỉnh sửa mạnh hơn ngày xưa.
 Mình tổng hợp thử 1 playlist những MV có production value cao mà hoa hết cả mắt:
 https://youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLDjUb6e81MyYcCmBL--8HCVIuDZXqwQJn
 Một cái mình thấy hay của âm nhạc Việt Nam gần đây là nhiều nghệ sĩ hàng đầu/mainstream đi lên từ viral/indie như Sơn Tùng, Đen, Da LAB, Vũ, Ngọt, Cá Hồi Hoang,... Chắc do nền công nghiệp âm nhạc Việt Nam còn non trẻ nên có nhiều cơ hội cho người nghiệp dư hơn. Rồi còn nhờ có các kênh mạng xã hội như Youtube, Soundcloud,... nữa.

 Người người đi bán vé số, nhà nhà đi bán vé số. Cũng như các công nhân bị mất việc ở nhà máy ai cũng phải đi chạy Grab. Các công ty vé số vẫn lãi nghìn tỷ, và cả triệu người đi bán vé số bị mắc kẹt trong cái vòng lẩn quẩn chính phủ đã tạo ra để lý giải cho việc Xổ Số Kiến Thiết là &quot;Ích nước lợi nhà&quot;. Và các đồng tiền đó từ sạch bị biến thành dơ bẩn qua các dự án nghìn tỷ, và phải đem đi rửa lại. 
 Số tiền đó không được dùng để giúp các người nghèo, người cơ nhỡ. Nếu có thì các mạnh thường quân sẽ không phải đi làm từ thiện tự phát nhiều đến như vậy.
 Không mua giúp cho người bán vé số thì họ sẽ chết đói. Nhưng mua thì lại làm giàu cho các cty vé số.
 Vietlott ít ra cũng minh bạch hơn và số tiền thưởng cũng cao hơn. Đằng này, xổ số kiến thiết thì mỗi giải mỗi số, và số tiền thưởng cũng rất nhỏ. Nếu người ta có trúng cũng chỉ cho 30 ngày để nhận giải, không thì giữ luôn !?!?
 Tôi thì thường sẽ mua một tờ, và giúp cho thêm 10k. Nhưng dạo gần đây, đội quân vé số tăng lên nhiều vô kể. Chỉ cần ngồi một chỗ, trong vòng 30p sẽ có khoảng 10-15 người đến chào bán, năn nỉ, kỳ kèo. Mua giúp được cho 1-2 người là hết khả năng rồi. Không thể ngày nào cũng sẽ giúp được. Cuộc đời thật quá nghiệt ngã. 
 &quot;Tuy nhiên gần chục năm qua hai mẹ con ốm đau tự bỏ tiền thuốc, không bảo hiểm y tế, không phúc lợi, không có hợp đồng với bất kỳ bên nào. Thứ ít ỏi họ nhận được là khoản hoa hồng trên mỗi tờ vé, vừa đủ ăn uống ở mức cơ bản và trả tiền trọ.
 Tỷ lệ phát hành vé số lên đến mức 98-100% đạt được từ việc không cho người bán dạo cơ hội trả lại vé ế, không khác gì ép họ mua, đẩy rủi ro kinh doanh cho người yếu thế.
 Lợi nhuận đạt được đến mức nghìn tỷ nhưng chiết khấu cho người bán dạo rất thấp (1.000-1.200 đồng mỗi tờ), không kèm theo bất cứ cứ quyền lợi nào khác.&quot;

                              <span>I don&#x27;t mean to generalize and paint everyone with the same broad strokes. That said, I&#x27;ve lived in three other Asian countries prior to coming to Vietnam, but the attitude and behavior of the foreigners in online communities here are the worst I&#x27;ve seen, particularly on reddit and especially above all on Facebook, at least in the Ho Chi Minh City online communities.
  
If you dare to mention one single thing you dislike about Vietnam (not even mentioning the many other things you DO like - and even if you do, you might get the following treatment) you get shouted at by other foreigners immediately telling you to just go home and calling you an entitled, colonizing, crybaby Westerner. Often these will be the most liked replies, particularly on Facebook.
 
I&#x27;ve seen foreigners in online communities seriously defend things like littering, disobeying of traffic laws (Vietnam has a rather high rate of traffic fatalities), loud street karaoke at midnight, cutting in line, and other such things as just &quot;cultural relativism&quot; (as though littering isn&#x27;t objectively bad for the environment - people ok reddit were honestly defending littering), often with a healthy dose of whataboutism and telling the person to go home. Again, these will often be the most liked replies.
 
I&#x27;ve seen people posting on online communities asking about problems(ex: &quot;is it a problem when I&#x27;ve seen multiple cockroaches in my apartment in one week&quot;) or simple questions like &quot;is the rain in October THAT bad?&quot; only to get bluntly called an idiot and mistreated. 
 
 As said, I&#x27;ve lived in three other Asian countries and participated in their online communities, and the foreigners in Vietnam are seriously the worst I&#x27;ve seen on their discourse. Even the weebs in Japanese communities, who are quite the sight at times, are less toxic and that is really saying something.
 So, why is this such a problem? What&#x27;s happened that has resulted in such toxic online communities here?

                              <span>Hey all. 
 I’m considering a move (for 1-2 years) or at the very least some longer term travel to Vietnam in the next few years but the only thing holding me back is that I take medication that is restricted in Vietnam. I know that there are many restricted medications available without a script in some pharmacies but I really can’t afford to be without them and would love to know if there is a safe and more legit way to do this. 
 I’m a little unsure about being able to access them and am worried it will impact my ability to stay for longer than 30-60 days at a time. I have prescriptions from home and while the law stipulates that I am only allowed to bring 7 days worth of this medication into the country/m- though I haven’t had issues with this previously. Is it as easy as going to a doctor (or psychiatrist?) with a letter from my doctor and list of prescribed medications and diagnosis? 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi All! My wife and my parents are visiting Vietnam in 1 week. I have some prescription pain relief for athritis and shoulder injuries. It&#x27;s nothing too heavy, My doctor has written me a letter. We are in Vietnam for a month and I may not have enough. If I need to get more would the letter and packaging be enough or would I need a doctors prescription?
 Thanks for your help! Cant wait to visit
 P.S if u have any info that will help us let me know, e.g weather, pricing on things atm, things to see/do.
 Haven&#x27;t been since 2016.

Việt Nam là đất nước xuất khẩu cà phê lớn trên thế giới, nhưng những người dân ở các nước trên thế giới hầu như không biết đến cà phê VN, mà chỉ có những người trong ngành cà phê biết đến.

                              <span>Currently a solo female traveling through Vietnam and having a great time.
 However, I got into my grab to go to my new hotel and during the ride, I saw him take a picture of my destination with my name and it looked like he sent it to a chat. I am very worried now.
 It could be that he was asking someone where the hotel was. When he first looked at the address, he looked confused, so I’m hoping it’s something as innocent as that.
 As of now, I’m in my room with the door locked and wondering if there’s anything I should do or if I should still be worried.
 I want to know if anyone has experienced this before and what would be the best course of action. 
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I was talking to a dietician.
 I cannot tolerate diary. So I cannot consume milk, cheese, etc. So I need to eat something else that is a good source of calcium. 
 I told her I buy tofu and soy milk at the markets where we see vendors sell raw fruits, veggies, etc. I told her that there is no labels. She asked me whether the soy milk is fortified. She told me that the tofu and the soy milk might not have calcium as we do not know how they are prepared. 
 My questions are: 
  
How is the tofu and soy milk prepared here? 
 Is the soy milk fortified? 
 Does the tofu and the soy milk at the markets have calcium?

                              <span>Hello, guys. I am finishing my undergraduate thesis and the main theme is about American Cinema during VietNam War. I am studying how the American Cinema creates stereotypes and misjudges vietnamise culture by making bad/unreal representations of VietNam. Although, I am not vietnamese and I&#x27;m having lots of problems in identifying the cultural aspects that are bad represented, like clothes, accents and other specific things as well. 
 Is there any vietnamese cinephile that already watched American movies in this subreddit? I&#x27;d like to make some questions!!
 At the same time, books, articles and everything else that could help me dive into the VietNam culture or the American War in Vietnamese perspective would be nice to know. Any recommendations?
 Edit: The movies I am studying are: Green-Berets (1968), The Deer Hunter (1978), Apocalypse Now (1979), Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987), Good Morning Vietnam (1988), Casualties of War (1989).

                              <span>I just finished my trip to Sapa, and man is it beautiful! During my stay, I went on a trek led by a Hmong woman, and she shared some tips about how to support the local minority groups when traveling in this region. Here are the highlights:
  
Do your research when booking trekking expeditions. Most Sapa trekking companies are run by Vietnamese agencies that pay the local guides just a couple of dollars a day. We trekked with Sapa Sisters, which is owned and operated by Hmong women. The guides that lead Sapa Sisters treks receive half the profits from their treks as well as health insurance and paid maternal leave. Our guide said her dream is for everyone to get to work for Sapa Sisters, but for that to happen, they need more business. 
 
Almost all hotels and hostels in Sapa town are owned by Vietnamese companies. To support the locals, consider staying at a homestay in one of the nearby villages. These are often run by families from one of the nearby minority groups. It is super easy to catch a taxi or motorbike to get to these homestays, and they really appreciate the business. Plus, the views and food are better further out from the city!
 
Try to buy souvenirs directly from locals. The stuff in established shops in town is probably not handmade, anyways. 
 
 Safe travels!

                              <span>I recently had to move out of company accomodation in HCM city and need to find a new apartment before the next school year. What is the best way to find a place in the D10/ Govap/ D12 side of town? Most of the places I&#x27;ve seen advertised are in D1/2/3 and that&#x27;s miles away from my work.

                              <span>As the title says I&#x27;m the brother of the soon to be wife and they will be having two wedding ceremonies. One here in the United States, and the other out in Vietnam (don&#x27;t know where exactly yet). What should I expect as someone outside of the culture and who wants to be there for my sister? 
 Obviously have no intentions of harassing or causing any discomfort to the locals to the best of my ability. I&#x27;m just here to support her and her soon to be husband....so obviously don&#x27;t want to offend his family in some way. 
 Also was not sure on which flair for this exactly. Sorry for any confusion.

                              <span>Currently in Ninh binh and planned for next stop to be sapa. However prices on the weekend are very high plus I am sure it is way busier with tourists. Wondering if there is somewhere interesting to go besides Hanoi(already spent 3 nights there) that is in between the two as this would also cut down on 8 hour bus ride

                              <span>I’m an Australian who has traveled to Vietnam many times and I absolutely love Vietnamese food, culture, beautiful landscapes and cities - but most of all I love the kindness and friendliness of the people. I work in the health sector and I see how significantly drugs and alcohol impact high volumes of people in my own country. Whilst travelling in Vietnam I found myself wondering: is drug use and abuse common in Vietnam? For example do college kids experiment with marijuana or try ecstasy at clubs? Are there heroin/meth addicts? I just feel as though I never saw anyone drug affected in all my time in Vietnam! Genuinely curious. Thank you!

                              <span>I came across this photo from the Vietnam vs. USA women&#x27;s World Cup match the other day
 Vietnam, ranked 32nd, making history with their first ever appearance in a World Cup. Facing world #1 and the back-to-back World Cup champions. The USA.
 Let&#x27;s be honest, Vietnam was expected to get their butts kicked by the US. The 13-0 thrashing of Thailand in the 2019 World Cup wasn&#x27;t out of the question.
 What ended as a 3-0 win by the US where Vietnam played very strong defensively, disrupted the US from many opportunities, and the goalkeeper also saved a penalty kick which was an awesome moment to watch.
 The joy on the face of the goalkeeper in this photo, and also the respect in the style of handshake she is offering the opponent after the loss. Something about this photo is just awesome. 
 The faces of both Vietnamese players. Knowing they went up against the world #1. And although they didn&#x27;t do the completely unexpected and pull out a victory. They did do the unexpected as they managed to keep the score very manageable and respectable. That locker room after the match probably felt like a victory party. There was not much to be disappointed about after that match.
 I hope to see them do well in their upcoming matches. A goal would be an awesome moment for Vietnam. Good luck ladies

                              <span>Hi all. I live in the US and am planning on traveling to Vietnam in September.
 Planning on Hanoi and looking for some advice. I&#x27;m in my late 40s and considering retiring and moving to Vietnam, but that won&#x27;t be determined until I visit and get a feel for the country and life. Firstly, is that possible? I&#x27;d read that while foreigners can&#x27;t own property, they can lease for 50 years which is fine by me, but as far as obtaining a visa that would allow me to stay indefinitely, is that possible? What would be the order in which to do things (visa/apartment purchase/etc.) if I fall in love with the country? Also, anything I should know on bisiting or any common scams to keep a lookout for? I&#x27;m not looking for companionship, so those particular scams won&#x27;t apply

                              <span>They are everywhere!! But the most annoying part is when they come into my house! In 3 days time I have already seen 2 giant rats running around! 
 But they are smart… Glue traps, they won’t fall for it.. Metal cages… they won’t go in… They are probably not desperate enough to risk their life for the food I put in the traps..
 I have made eyecontact with several of these creatures and actually have some sympathy for them. I really don’t want to kill them… but they are just everywhere!!!! 
 Is there a way to prevent rats coming inside a house? 
 Btw, I never leave food outside.

                              <span>I am not from Vietnam but I’ve lived here for over 7 years and I have Vietnamese family.
 I mean no offense! But why is Vietnamese driving so bad and why does no body care? During covid there was a massive overreaction and national unity to be safe. The highest death rate in Vietnam is due to roadside accidents. Way more deaths than by Covid. So why do people continue to drive so badly? I see people FaceTiming, eating Banh Mi, driving into people, running red lights, the list goes on. I have also unfortunately seen many people dead on the road due crashes. 
 Will this ever change? Why don’t people take driving as seriously as they did Covid?

                              <span>The last few days have seen an explosion of posts about r/place. It seems people are treating the drawings there as some sort of national pride&#x27;s symbols and if anything happens to them, the whole country is profoundly humiliated.
 Though a nationalist myself, I find these activities utter nonsense. I really do hope people would use their time more wisely to do something useful instead of looking for some cheap internet pride.

 Per the below really only need a zipper be brought back into the zipline so I assume a shoe repair service could do that to?
 Im in D4 but willing to travel a reasonable amount.

                              <span>I (19M, US Citizen) am interested in moving to Vietnam for about a year or two (I am a freelance artist, and that&#x27;s what I plan to do while I&#x27;m there). I want to move to Northern Lào Cai in a studio somewhere in a city where I can retain most of my standard of living. It&#x27;s right next to China which would make border runs every 90 days very easy (With China&#x27;s 10-year multi-entry visa.) 
 I was doing some research for it but I just couldn&#x27;t find the answers to the questions I had. 
  
Is Lào Cai more rural or urban?
 Why can&#x27;t I find any studios for rent there? (Maybe I haven&#x27;t looked hard enough, but every search just shows places in Ho Chi Minh)
 Is Lào Cai relatively safe?
 Rough monthly Cost of living (I am extremely frugal and willing to make sacrifices to get by if need be, I really only need water, safe housing, and internet/phone services for my work)
  
Thank you in advance for the help, I don&#x27;t speak a lick of Vietnamese yet so it was difficult to translate through all the websites and still find nothing.

 I’m not familiar with Khmer or Lao cultures. Is there any grain of truth to the stereotype?

                              <span>My partner loves vietamese dramas but doesn&#x27;t watch them much since coming to my country as she doesn&#x27;t really watch them alone and used to view with her mither. I&#x27;m not a big drama show person, but, I think it would make her really happy to watch them with her so I&#x27;d like to try them out. Also, I&#x27;m sure once I start watching they&#x27;d grow on me quite a bit. 
 Does anyone know of any sites that provide English subs? I&#x27;ve found one I think but it ends up being very selective on what show, movie, or episode has the subs.

I know yieu means love. When I asked him about it he said that it’s normal to bwteen sisters and brothers to say that to each other , but I’ve never heard him call his own biological sisters by that kind of name . I just want to know is this appropriate or normal in Vietnam tradition to call brother in laws and sister in laws Anh yieu and em yieu?

                              <span>This r/place event shows how poor Vietnam&#x27;s internet culture is when many Vietnamese first use a global, mixed-country social network. Most Vietnamese people only use Facebook or TikTok to chat with fellow countrymen in their community. So, like fish in a pond going to sea, some embarrassing aspects can be seen:
 Weird nationalism is most evident when a propaganda poster is the first choice of art to show Reddit about our country. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with wanting to show sovereignty, but this event isn&#x27;t the place to do it. So among various creative artworks, the propaganda poster appears very out of place. We could&#x27;ve drawn cultures, buildings, or famous people instead. If you use Facebook a lot, you can also see for yourself how obsessed Vietnamese are with nationalism.
 Facebook doesn&#x27;t have a clear upvote and downvote system like Reddit, so many Vietnamese people who only use Facebook have the habit of commenting mindlessly in their own way and get downvoted straight away as a result when they comment on Reddit. That illustrates how poor their reasoning and chatting skills are.
 Vietnamese Facebookers and tiktokers tend to follow the crowd and blame others. When the Vietnamese artwork expanded, there were thousands of copy-paste comments with empty apologies and blaming an unknown third party. But without doing anything to fix it, the affected communities have to do it themselves. They only care to save their faces to feel good while doing nothing.
 As a Vietnamese person myself, I used to use Facebook a lot in the past, but nowadays I barely use it because of the terrible internet culture in Vietnam. After finding out about Reddit, I find it a much better social media platform for entertainment and discussion. Engaging in Vietnamese Facebook posts is just really frustrating to me.

 Ý thức kém xong nói thế này thế kia. Đến lúc raid ngược thì chịu lại đổ lỗi. Nói thật chứ các ông làm ăn nó cũng 1 vừa 2 phải thôi chiếm thế này hội xQc nó raid cả bức cũng không ngoa. Làm ơn hãy có ý thức đừng chỉ vì 1 bộ phận newbie từ stream Độ qua mà cả cộng đồng ae redditer Việt Nam chân chính bị mang tiếng xấu!!! Thanks

                              <span>Yêu nước là tốt, nhưng giờ thông điệp và độ thẩm mỹ đã đi quá xa so với dự kiến ban đầu
 Mọi người thấy đấy, ban đầu mục đích ý nghĩa là tuyên truyền về chủ quyền biển đảo bằng hình ảnh Việt Nam và hai quần đảo, rất đẹp, rất ý nghĩa.
 NHƯNG
 Sau khi bành trướng. Thêm mấy hình công nông bộ đội vào to hơn hẳn cả hình ảnh đất nước và hai quần đảo. Chủ thể lúc này đã bị chuyển đổi, ý nghĩa cũng đã bị thay đổi theo. Tấm hình giờ rất không khác gì một tấm pano áp phích cổ động những năm 80 và ý nghĩa về chủ quyền biển đảo cũng không còn nữa.
 Tôi yêu nước, nhưng tôi cũng chả đồng tình cái cách những lá cờ nhạt nhẽo (Đặc biệt là cái Pano VN hiện tại) của các nước lấn át những bức art thực sự , phá huỷ hoàn toàn công sức tạo nên các bức art tuyệt mỹ đó của các hội nhóm khác.
 Các bạn nên bớt rảnh lại, và đừng lôi vấn đề yêu nước lấp liếm hành vi phá hoại này lại ngay. Mục đích của chúng ta đã đạt được từ cách đây hơn 24h trước rồi. Cộng đồng reddit đang chửi chúng ta như chửi chó kia kìa

                              <span>Hi guys I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right sub to ask this qn, if it&#x27;s not pls direct me to the correct one 🙏.
 So I&#x27;m a JC student from Singapore and towards the end of the year a grp of us are going to visit several orphanages in Ho Chi Minh to entertain the children there as part of a school organised trip. We have come up with several activities to accommodate the kids as many of them have either physical or mental disabilities.
 One of the ideas that I proposed which got the go ahead was to play some songs on the recorder for the kids. I heard that music can be very engaging towards those that have mental disabilities. Some advice that I received was to pick songs that would be familiar to the kids so that they could enjoy it.
 So is there any song recommendations that the kids would know? Vietnamese nursery rhymes? Anything along that vein? Although I do have a musical background I have not touched the recorder in quite a while. So songs that might be too complicated would be a no go HAHA.
 Anyways thanks for reading, have a great day!

                              <span>Ae cũng biết đang nhộn nhịp vụ vẽ vời trên r/place. quan điểm của t như này: bên của mixi hay osu thì cũng là nỗ lực của bao người, có người thấy đẹp thì thấy đẹp, xấu thì sẽ là xấu (cái này không bàn). Cái chính là mấy thằng đ.ần mồm cứ nghêu ngao &quot;đây là nơi vẽ nghệ thuật không được đưa chính trị vào huhu&quot;. cái r/place này giống như là nơi mà ai muốn vẽ gì thì vẽ, thể hiện sự sáng tạo, bên ông độ vẽ như thế thì cho hỏi đ sáng tạo chỗ nào? chưa kể, thích coi đây là nơi không chính trị đúng không? lên mà xoá xe tăng với máy bay chiến đấu của u cà navi kìa. chủ quyền đất nước là chính trị thì vũ khí giết người kia là gì? giáo cụ trực quan của mấy đứa mầm non hả? t thừa biết đầy đứa nói mấy câu này chắc chỉ muốn thể hiện đẳng cấp tinh tế là yêu nghệ thuật hoà bình, ghét chiến tranh (hâha).

                              <span>Long story short, I’m going to be meeting my biological family for the first time in-person in a few months. I am from the US. What would be good gifts for when I meet them? If it helps, I am from New York so there’s the possibility of bringing cool things from NYC. 
 I want to get something for my birth mom, brother, his wife, and their two young children.

                              <span>While most was watching Messi&#x27;s first game in the US. I was ecstatic about US vs VN. The game was better than expected only because I thought US was going to cut through VN like butter. Although offense and counter attack was so so defense was great and to block a penalty kick by Alex Morgan. Miss T. T. Kim Thanh is the MVP in my book for that. Needless to say USA might struggle for the 3 peat.

                              <span>Some kind hearted people decided to burn their mattresses and other rubbish right next to the English center I work at. I understand it&#x27;s the country side and it&#x27;s common to burn trash. But why right next to the school. The whole road is empty , yet they choose to burn next to the school and fill the rooms with toxic plastic smoke. It&#x27;s disgusting and terrible for all the children and adults health.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve observed that Vietnamese individuals rarely engage in serious academic or scientific discussions on Facebook. Content channels that focus on science are carefully curated, making it challenging for them to become popular. Instead, groups that boast about achievements, offer humor, or criticize celebrities tend to gain significant traction. This has always piqued my curiosity, as finding groups that genuinely provide valuable knowledge is a rarity. If you happen to know any such groups, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it if you could share their names and information!
 Regarding the group I&#x27;m currently enjoying, it can be found at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/vietnambinhan.

                              <span>I think this is the problem that some of us are facing when having typical Asian parents. The relationship between me (26) and my mom (65 years old) is really bad that we didn’t have a proper conversation for 10 years (+). It&#x27;s not that she did anything wrong, it&#x27;s just the age gap between us that makes us hard to understand each other. And the things she thoughts were good for me made me felt uncomfortable and pushed me further away from her. I wouldn’t go in details but I think we all understand what they are.
 I left the country when I was 16 years old and leave far away from her since then. But because of that reason, our relationship is getting better. I only came to visit once before Covid. And that visit turned out terrible. As soon as we spoke to each other, we fight. I then came to the conclusion that as long as I kept a safe distance from her, our relationship will be improved.
 I can tell that she is trying to fix our relationship in recent years. Every time she called me, she really tried to not say anything wrong or to upset me. The things she did wrong that hurt me, she no longer does. It&#x27;s just the negative feelings toward her that already haunted me.
 I wanted to try, but the idea of speaking to her itself made me feel uncomfortable, not to mention the long quiet between us. 
 In the last couple of years, I don&#x27;t really find myself trying to improve the relationship anymore. I am happy without speaking to her, although I still endear her a lot. To make up for my neglect, I take care of her by sending money back to Vietnam. I understand that it&#x27;s not enough. And as her child, I need to do more for her.
 But she is getting older, I know that any conversation I have with her could be the last one. I am too scared of the idea that I will regret not taking action sooner one day. However, I don’t know how to fix this and where to start with. My Vietnamese fellow, if you were in the same situation, could you give me some suggestions?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I’m just a foreigner who is living in Vietnam, but I feel I have a right to bring this up, probably brought up many times. 
 But this is without a doubt one of the most beautiful places in the world, but it is disgusting to see people throw trash on the ground, even trash covering the roads in rural areas, I am en route to Nha Trang by bus and our driver just pulled over outside someone’s home in the Minh province, throw three iced coffee cups out the door, got out to have a smoke and threw the butt towards the homes driveway. 
 Serious questionable mentality with some people here. Need to start treasuring this amazing country they have and not treat it as a landfill. My Vietnamese girlfriend along with our mutual Vietnamese friends, all in our mid 20’s to early 30’s are disgusted by it also. Shit behaviour

                              <span>First and for most thank you for reading this,
 For context, I moved to California when I was in 4th grade. I&#x27;ve studied in America for almost 10 years. I&#x27;ve struggled and pulled through a lot, and I&#x27;ve been accepted to a very well-known university (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) in California for engineering (highly recruited and famous among all tech companies). 
 My options were: UCSB, UCD, Cal Poly, and UCI. I chose Cal Poly. 
 I can stay in America and make a lot of money, but my parents are getting old and I planned to live near them. I can write and speak in both Vietnamese and English, but I prefer English as my main language (writing in Vietnamese can be a struggle). 
 Since, I have lived in America for so long, I&#x27;m not familiar with the job prospect in Vietnam. I hope to work for a foreign company in Vietnam that pay me well for my prestigious foreign degree and skills.
 Therefore, I need advice on what kind of engineering or degree would yield me the most job prospect in Vietnam. 
 Options: Computer Engineering, Data Science &amp; Statistics, Mechanical Engineering, or Business 
 Any insights or combinations of degrees that would optimize my salary would be greatly appreciated. Any kind of experience or companies that I can focus to break into? 
 I plan on getting an MS degree also.
 Please give me a reasonable salary range that I can expect to work in Vietnam for a foreign company.
 My parents live in HCM City. 
 If you spend time reading all of this to understand my situation, I hope you know that I greatly appreciate your time. I consider Vietnam my hometown, and a place that I love. Thank you so much!

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m currently on a mission to find the perfect spot for a special life event - proposing to my girlfriend of six years. We are going to travel to Vietnam in the middle of September, and we will start our trip in the north around Sa Pa. Then, we will probably continue gradually to the south.
 I don&#x27;t think I will be able to keep this secret for so long, so I&#x27;m searching for a good, quiet, and romantic place, probably in the north of Vietnam. However, if there is something worth considering in the South, I will be open to it :)
 I would really appreciate your personal recommendations for a romantic location.
 Thanks in advance!

I say one place as it will be difficult to travel much (plane etc) between work commitments. Any advice appreciated!

                              <span>So I recently went and got IV fluids and an antibiotic along with a 5 day antibiotics prescription, it came to 2,700,000 dong! I was a bit shocked considering it&#x27;s Vietnam? Is this normal or was I scammed. It wasn&#x27;t in a hospital it was in a pharmacy, not to mention it was cash only! I&#x27;ve no proof except their own written prescription for insurance to claim it back

                              <span>My mother was born and raised in Saigon and fled after the war to America. I&#x27;m American born and don&#x27;t really speak Viet. Growing up, I remember tons of &quot;us vs. them&quot; stories and how the sound of northern accent can instantly put them (moms family) into an angry and aggressive mode. I never really gave it much thought because I&#x27;m American. I&#x27;ve only visited Vietnam twice years ago.
 Anyways I&#x27;ve lived in Japan for a few years and met a girl from Hanoi. I&#x27;ve never dated a Vietnamese girl before and honestly never thought I would. Conversation wise and personality wise, I think we get along quite well. It&#x27;s funny because we have to communicate in Japanese, which is neither of our mother tongues. I&#x27;m now more motivated to improve my Vietnamese, and her English is making good progress too.
 We aren&#x27;t dating officially, but both of us are definitely interested in next steps. We are both 30+ so I think we both recognize the need for discretion and caution, to respect each other&#x27;s time, feelings, and limitations. I need to be in America for the time being so it would be long distance. 
 My main concern is regarding potential culture clashes with her being from the north. I hate to say it but my family is so judgmental and can be blindly toxic. Im really worried how my mom would react. I know it&#x27;s illogical and kinda racist behavior so before people attack my mother, please understand that she comes from war torn Vietnam and we have lost numerous family members during the war. They have serious trauma associated with the northern accent, and I would like to hear what others think and how their experiences have fared.
 Any thoughts, advice or discussion is welcome. Thank you for sharing your experiences and keeping it civil.

                              <span>It is said that after China was conquered by the Manchus, they were polluted by the barbarian culture. Many Sinosphere nations wanted to invade the Qing Dynasty and restore China. It is said that Gia Long planned an invasion, which never came to fruition. 
 However, Vietnamese clothing showed signs of evolving to be more like the Manchu Qizhuang in the late-19th century for some reason.
 Before that, Vietnamese clothes were more flowy like Chinese and Korean ones. Japanese ones weren’t so flowy but they didn’t look like Manchu ones.
 Why?

Rushed back to my hotel and downed a hydration pack. Is this normal? Does the body adjust? Everyone else at the gym had the normal amount of sweat. I didn’t even lift heavy!

                              <span>I love coffee in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve lived in Vietnam for 8 years now and coffee is 20℅ of the reason for that. I&#x27;m married and my wife and I have a daughter. 
 We&#x27;ve travelled a lot and stayed at a lot of different hotels and resorts. One thing my wife and I have always noticed, the coffee at these resorts is terrible. 
 How can a resort that charges 1.7 mill a night make worse coffee than Ca Phe 123 I can find down some random street who only charges 25k? 
 My wife says it&#x27;s becuase the resort wants to make it for western customers, but a place like Vin Pearl has 90℅ Vietnamese guests. 
 Like, go to any cafe with plastic tables and chairs and I would bet money their coffee will be better than a 5 star resort. What&#x27;s up with that?

                              <span>The current game of Vietnam vs the USA has all the makings of a possible upset. I have not heard much hype from my Vietnamese friends and coworkers. Sadly they seemed more excited about Messi debuting for Miami. I would hope that there are world cup viewings setup in Ho Chi Minh and other major cities; to show support for these women.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an American expat in Taiwan but my wife is Vietnamese hence why I lurk on this sub. I noticed that there seem to be a lot of salty redditors on this sub who seem to think that all white expats in Vietnam are sex tourists, and dating the locals is an expression of &quot;attempting to quench their thirst for submissive Asian girls&quot;. Pretty much every post here where an expat gets scammed by a bar girl has at least one or two redditors celebrating their misfortune.
 I don&#x27;t see this attitude nearly so much in Taiwan. Nobody seems to have much of a problem with expats dating and marrying locals, and I seldom here any accusations of less than honorable motivations for doing so. 
 Is it that Vietnam attracts a particularly unsavory variety of expat? Are Vietnamese men more xenophobic than their Taiwanese counterparts? Is this particular subreddit just a little bit more toxic than it&#x27;s Taiwanese counterpart? 
 Partially curious just for shits and giggles, but also trying to get a feel for what living in Vietnam would be like and the attitudes of locals towards expats in case the misses and I ever decide to relocate there.

                              <span>Hello, does anyone know of any Asian brand sugar free energy drinks? Available in Saigon, or where I should look? The circle k (and similar) only have monster brand which is expensive and Asian brands have too much sugar, thank you

                              <span>One thing I find peculiar, from what I&#x27;ve been told, whether foreigner or citizen, all properties require a 30% upfront down payment in order to qualify for or be approved for a loan from a financial institution? Is this correct? Not yet in the process of buying but considering it among other options in VN and in the region. Can anyone share personal experiences of buying as a foreigner or married to VN partner? I understand that VN is a fast growing economy and the housing market is rapidly changing and have also heard many opinions on whether it is a financially sound decision in regards to the current and projected state of the market and quality of purchased unit. Can anyone share a personal experience?

 Any advice or recommendation for a lawyer dealing with property dispute?
 How fair/corrupt is the court system?
 Is it common in VN, for a lawyer to work for opposing sides?
 Do lawyer takes money/favors from both sides?
 Is it also common for judges accept bribery?
 Any experience would be useful.

                              <span>Hello! So recently I went to HCMC. The food and the places were amazing, but the one thing I can’t get out of my mind are the dogs around the city. At first I just saw one dog of a particular breed which is supposed to be “regular-sized” and thought that must’ve been a mixed dog. However, the more I explored the city, the more dogs I saw that had short and stubby legs (they are all different breeds btw). I even went on a Mekong delta tour and even the dogs on the island we went to were stubby as well. Can someone explain this to me or is it all just a coincidence? I’m genuinely curious about this as I’ve thought about it for a good amount of time on the flight home lol.
  
I read somewhere that they’re tiny mainly to fit them in smaller apartments/housing around the city. But why not get dogs of a small breed to begin with? 
 
A local humored us by saying that dogs are smaller so that they can be eaten easily (pls don’t be true T_T)

                              <span>Hi, probably not the best place to ask (already booked a doctors appointment to talk to a GP). 
 2-3 weeks ago I was travelling in Vietnam and went to the Cu Chi tunnels. There was a couple bats in there. While going through one the tunnels a bat flew at me, bounced off my torso and flew away. The contact was very brief and I didn’t feel like it scratched/bit me but after seeing some fearmongering tiktoks (haha cringe I know) they were saying you should get a rabies vaccine/immunoglobulin even if it didn’t bite you as the bites can go unnoticed due to their small size. It’s been 17 days since the bat flew into me. 
 Should I be worried? Is lyssavirus common for bats in the area or have their been many cases? Tried to find some vietnam specific info but no luck. I know in Australia (where I am from and where I am now) that contact with bats is typically treated for rabies. 
 Will definitely take the advice of the GP once we’ve talked but just wanted to know if any of you guys have had similar experiences or any knowledge.

                              <span>I live in US and plan to travel to Vietnam with family in August, flying into Hanoi. First time visiting Vietnam. I saw a post about getting money exchanged at jewelry shops, and all ATMs charge crazy fees. So, wondering if I need to get some VND in US before I fly over since it might take some time for me to find a jewelry store. Or perhaps I can use USD if I can&#x27;t find a jewelry shop?

 What are the current rules and what does the most people do? I plan to be in cities and on country sites.
 I will bring spear masks for the pollution, but the question is, if it is also necessary for COVID.

Was curious, can I get an ADHD diagnosis/assessment &amp; possibly medication in Vietnam as a U.S citizen? I’ve been trying dearly to get it done in the U.S but it is so expensive &amp; just trying to find a psychologist is complicated. &amp; how is healthcare there for a U.S citizen? Is it free or low cost? Do I need to be insured etc? Any insight helps truly, thank you!

                              <span>So I’ve been back in Vietnam for over 1.5 month now. But it seems to be very hard to find the right place to meet people around my age (21). Anyone that can help me out with potential places that are knowingly open for conversation and meeting people (Ho Chi Minh City).

I know my wife will not get on a motorcycle and is not great with heights. Is there any other way for us to enjoy this area without scaring her to death :).
 Thanks for your help…

                              <span>Chào mọi người! Sự kiện thu hút nhiều sự quan tâm của Reddit đã trở lại rồi và bất cứ ai cũng có thể tham gia bằng cách truy cập vào r/place.
 Để có thể phối hợp tốt hơn, các bạn nên tham gia vào hai Discord server dưới đây:
  
Server của r/vietnam tại https://discord.gg/HRvPMnKzBA
 Server được tạo cho sự kiện r/place tại https://discord.gg/r-placevietnam-960076480916901948. Lưu ý rằng nó không được vận hành bởi các mod của r/vietnam.
  
Chúc các bạn chơi r/place vui vẻ.
 Và đừng tạo những bài viết mới về r/place nhé. Như vậy làm sub rất giống bị spam. Cảm ơn các bạn!
  
Hey r/vietnam homies! The epic pixel art battle of r/place is returning in 2023. Let&#x27;s represent Vietnam with some sick pixel art!
 For better teamwork, we have two discord servers that you can join: 
  
The official r/vietnam discord server at https://discord.gg/HRvPMnKzBA
 
The Vietnamese r/place community server at https://discord.gg/r-placevietnam-960076480916901948. It&#x27;s specifically for r/place but just remember it&#x27;s not run by the r/vietnam mods.
 
 Let&#x27;s have fun and make friends with all the communities. And of course, don&#x27;t forget to occasionally touch grass and stay hydrated when placing those pixels ;)
 See you on the canvas, you creative geniuses!
 And please don&#x27;t flood the sub with new r/place posts. Thank you!

 In May this year I spent about a week in Da Nang and I really enjoyed my stay there.
 I am planning to do another Vietnam trip soon and want to know if there are any good (multi-day)hikes in/around Da Nang?
 Thanks!

                              <span>At first the seller told me $60 which is 1.418.400 VND.
 The item is a jacket and the box is sized accordingly. I made a shipping box of the dimensions and I got a quote from Vietnam post’s website. I input all the details and I received the estimate cost of 426.900
 I asked the seller how come there’s a difference between the quote and the estimate and they told me it will be higher and sent me a screenshot of a page from bill.ems.com.vn and the quote came to 2.208.600 VND
 Is this correct? I just want to make sure because usually government post is not that high priced.
 Thanks in advance
 Edit: to clarify the 426.900 I have mentioned is the EMS option from Vietnam Post

 I&#x27;m planning a trip to Vietnam and I&#x27;m wondering what the weather is like in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City during the month of August. I&#x27;ve heard that it can be rainy during this time, but I&#x27;m not sure what to expect.
 If you&#x27;ve been to these cities during this time, can you share your experience? Did the rain impact your itinerary or were you still able to enjoy your trip? Any tips on what to pack or how to prepare for the weather would be greatly appreciated.
 Also, if you have any recommendations for must-see sights or hidden gems in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, please feel free to share!
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 6 years ago my husband and I visited the Pearl farm in Ha Long Bay and bought a simple pearl necklace that now has more sentimental value than everything I own put together.
 The chain broke so I visited a local jewelers to get it fixed and they contacted me today to say they&#x27;ve lost it.
 I am absolutely heartbroken.
 If there are any travelers on their way there that live in the UK please let me know 🙏🏻

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping to shop for some tailor made suits in Hoi An in two months, but am visiting several other cities after that. Is it feasible/reasonable to have my suits shipped to my HCMC hotel as that&#x27;s my final destination in the country? Any insight on the price/time/logistics for that? I&#x27;m not concerned about bringing them on my final flight home and would rather not deal with international shipping.

                              <span>Hi there!
 Husband and I (both EU nationals) are moving to HCMC soon and will be living there on student visas. Looking at our health insurance options, I would really like to hear about your experiences. We&#x27;re both in our 30s, no pre-existing conditions, no kids in our present or future, and looking for coverage that goes further than emergencies but doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Any recommendations? 
 Thanks everyone!!

                              <span>Hello,
 My boyfriend and I will be traveling to Hanoi in mid-September. We have heard that it is cheaper to walk in to hotels rather than reserving them online, as the online prices can be much higher. Is this true? And would we be able to find hotels relatively easily by just walking in? Our plan was to book a hotel for the first night or two and then just find another hotel we could walk into.
 Also, does anyone know of a good hotel in Hanoi between $25-40 a night? I&#x27;ve been looking on Agoda.com, but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell if the reviews are real or not.

                              <span>A friend visiting sent me this pic from a domestic flight within Vietnam and asked why this was a thing. After that, I couldn’t stop seeing naked feet everywhere (airports, cafes, parks, bars…) so I guess I was at one point desensitized to it 
 Are naked feet in public fairly accepted or is it a divisive issue?

                              <span>Hey so I just got to Hanoi and my friend matched with a girl on tinder. She took us to a club and proceeded to buy drinks, balloons and food. We spent a couple hundred dollars and the girls still wanted to order more drinks until we said enough is enough. We understand this was a mistake and shouldn’t have signed anything until we knew what we were getting.
 Do these girls work for the club? Do they get commission? 
 Very curious and how to differentiate between a genuine connection vs a scam.

                              <span>Hi there friends, I (24F) and my partner (30M) are moving from the UK to HCMc in September. If anyone is able to offer advice on the following areas that would be really helpful!
  
What resources did you find were best for helping you to learn Vietnamese before moving? Textbooks etc.
  
 What are some rental red flags you&#x27;ve come across? We are hoping to live in D2/D3.
 I have moderate eczema and am curious about how a humid climate will impact that. If anyone in similar positions have found it easy enough to find OTC treatments?
 
  
To round it off if there are people in this subreddit that are also living around HCM and are looking to get a beer or coffee it would be great to make connections!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Visiting Vietnam in a couple of weeks, and wondering if I can get a good deal on a road bike. 
 Bikes are very expensive where I’m coming from, and it’d be great to have recommendations on bike shops/ retailers that frequently run discounts.
 Looking for a carbon frame with Ultegra group set. Not too fussy on the brand, but it’d be good to go with a Tier 1 name (Giant, Trek etc)
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Xin Chào everyone. I am right now in Ha Noi and was wondering where to buy film. I will also stay in Da Nang for around 6 days. Is that also enough to develop some pictures ? How long would it take and what are the prices for the film and the development? 
 Thank you so much

 Why is that? Any idea? She doesn&#x27;t know and says my app must be wrong. But google translate does it the same way as the app does.

                              <span>So, me and my vietnamese wife plan to retire from U.S. and live in Vietnam. I know i pay taxes for withdrawals from 401k but does Vietnam also tax that income? I would have all of my Social Security and 401k payments put into my US bank and then transferred as needed to Vietnam bank. I&#x27;m just trying to get an idea on what my budget will be like after taxes and such on my 401k and Social Security.

I can’t even order a bahn mi now without first asking for the price in case of yet another 60k snack. I will be cooking at home mostly for the next 3 months and heading back to Thailand. It’s a shame these people are ruining tourism and potential income for the rest of the lovely people I meet.

                              <span>I’ve been in Vietnam for the past couple of weeks visiting family and one thing that has been really difficult to witness is seeing how dogs are treated here. We passed by an owner beating a chained up dog and hearing its cries made my heart sink. On other occasions we’ve seen strays and malnourished dogs locked in cages forced to sit in the sweltering heat. This is not to say ALL Viet people treat dogs poorly, but I do sense that maybe dogs are not widely regarded in the same way as back in the States where I am from. 
 As a dog lover, I find the dog meat industry horrible given what I’ve read (dogs are stolen from communities and beaten/tortured/etc or unethical farming practices) but I know to some people it is just viewed as any other type of meat (beef/pork). My hope that this practice dies out, but I know where there’s demand, there will always be people who are willing to supply. This has made me wonder if the dog meat industry is still popular and how local communities view eating dog meat? Are there any hopes of this industry coming to an end?

                              <span>It&#x27;s a pretty hot topic recently. Some parents want their kids to study IELTS really early, like 6-10 years old. 
 Pros: Kids get to learn english very early which will most likely set them for success later on.
 Cons: It puts unnessessary stress on kids, kids can&#x27;t form an opinion about politics yet so the writing task is basically a goner. IELTS is not realistic; real life english is a lot less formal than IELTS.
 I figure if you use Reddit you&#x27;re probably better at English than 99% of native Vietnamese, so the opinions have a bit more merit to it.

                              <span>Whenever I make food that requires you to boil water/food (like pasta or chili), I usually set the food to boil on the stove then go do something else until it&#x27;s time for me to return. Despite this, every time I&#x27;m away from the kitchen for even a few minutes, my family will run into my room and yell at me that my food is boiling like it&#x27;s an emergency or something. And this happens with EVERYONE, dad, mom, grandpa, grandpa, aunts, uncles, cousins... on my dad&#x27;s side and my mom&#x27;s side... ... sometimes multiple times a day.
 This has been the case for as long as I&#x27;ve been cooking, 10+ years now. I can&#x27;t tell if this is a just an older generation thing, a cultural/Vietnamese thing or a my family thing??? I honestly want to know where this stems from. I&#x27;ve told my family that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m supposed to cook the recipe and they don&#x27;t need to worry about the food boiling but they still do it D:
 Does anyone else&#x27;s family does this?

                              <span>Does anybody have any experience/info about what is needed to bring a bow to Vietnam? I found some info that it is classified as a &quot;sporting weapon&quot; and there is a permit for it, but I do not know how to proceed. I will be flying into the country.
 Also, regulations and such aside, can I expect to run into issues with local law enforcement for carrying a bow? I will be backpacking and it will be inside the pack.

 Anyone have any recommendations? Ones that are relatively affordable 😅😅

                              <span>recently, my esthetician—who is dating a guy 2 years younger—explained that she called her bf before they started dating “em” (for obvious reasons), but started calling her bf “anh” after they started dating. she said other couples do this too because vietnamese boys like being “anh” and i’m genuinely just like huh ?? i speak other asian languages, and usually equivalent titles to anh, chị, em are strictly based on age unless someone is joking around… lowkey not that surprised because vietnam just be making up their own rules… but is this normal?? can you just… do that…?

                              <span>So, my wife and I have decided we are going to try to permanently settle in VN next year.
 I am an Australian citizen and my wife is dual Australian/Vietnamese. Since we have been saving for a house deposit in Australia, we literally have enough $$ for my wife to buy a plot of land and build a house on it in Vietnam, in the area my wife&#x27;s family lives. We want to do that, have a child, and my wife can potentially start a beauty salon in the local town.
 The main requirement for this to actually happen is that I need to be able to work 100% remotely. I am a software developer, and currently working remotely in VN (at the parents&#x27; farm) due to a very flexible company policy that allows me to work up to 4 weeks per year anywhere in the world. This policy is great, but obviously unsuitable for what my wife and I want to do. So the first thing I&#x27;m going to try to do is negotiate a deal with my employer - take a pay cut, work remotely, possibly fly to AU periodically (1 week every 2 months) to do on-prem work to maintain a bit of a physical presence.
 Failing that, I would need to find a remote job. We can probably afford for me to take a 30% cut and still live very comfortably. The trick is finding an employer happy for me to be 100% in VN (I&#x27;m prepared to be very flexible to meet timezone requirements), and possibly dealing with the tax implications of being a foreigner with a foreign job permanently living here (practically - I will be on rolling 5 year visa exemptions unless I get permanent residency).
 I guess my question is - are there people here (particularly software devs) who have done anything similar, and who have any advice about dealing with tax requirements, finding remote employment, etc?
 Any input appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be staying in HCMC for about 7 days. I&#x27;ve been doing some research and everybody here describes BV as a tourist hellhole. 
 I&#x27;m a tourist myself but I would like a more &quot;chill&quot; place/vibe. I like more cozy bars, local food and i just walking around a city. 
 But i don&#x27;t want to be so far off the map where locals give you the &quot;wtf are you doing here&quot; face when you enter a bar or restaurant. Any area recommendations ?

 My 2 cent: Vietnam economy is rising, people are optimistic, they&#x27;re nationalist and would rather stay in Vietnam. The old stereotype of &quot;desperate Vietnamese fleeing the country&quot; is a 80/90s meme back when the country was really, really poor.
 People don&#x27;t want to move outside of the country anymore, aside from the poor region of Vietnam (Nghe An) who want to move abroad so they can send money back to their family.

                              <span>Hi guys, is there any German here who would like to exchange languages with me? I can help with Vietnamese. I’m Vietnamese (25f) and learning German at the moment. But OMG it’s hard. Even though Duolingo helps me a lot, I want to have a chance to talk with real people. Some details about me: - My German now is A1/A2, so basic. - I’m in Ha Noi but not in the center so I would like to do video calls instead of meeting in person. - I’m not a Vietnamese teacher (only tutored math for students in secondary and high school in the past) so I can’t provide you the lessons like a teacher, but I always try my best with what I do. - I also don’t mind about the timezone if you are not in Vietnam at the moment as I’m working for a foreign company so my time is messed up, so if you can only help me at 2am in the morning Vietnam time then that’s totally okay. I can do it. Please send me a dm. I would appreciate your help. Have a wonderful day everyone!!

                              <span>Recently, my new girlfriend and I went on holiday- me caucasian, her Vietnamese. 
 We visited a tourist attraction (not a pagoda or anything remotely religious) in a countryside city. Neither of us had been there before. 
 At this place, I observed on 3 seperate occasions older women staring a me then staring at my girlfriend for a long period of time and giving her a dirty look. 
 2 other women said something disparaging (i believe referring to her as a hooker), as did a young guy. 
 My girlfriend is quite pretty, but she was dressed very modestly - certainly not dressed in a way that was remotely provocative. We only have an age gap of 5 years. We are both friendly and curteous to people we are around. 
 I have never experienced this before. I made me really upset for us. How dare they judge us like that? Who do they think they are to say things like that?
 Is this common, or is this unusual?
 If it is common, how to best deal with this? I felt like accosting them and dressing them down for being so rude, but I did not.

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m heading to Vietnam in a couple weeks and wondering if it&#x27;s possible to rent a bike or join a tour or something where I can cycle down Hai Van Pass?
 Upon reseraching alot of the tours are cycling up it which I&#x27;m not sure if I can physically do. I&#x27;m 30/m/average fitness but not don&#x27;t think I could cycle uphill in the heat. Would prefer to go down the hill at my own pace.

                              <span>We are currently staying in Hanoi and had plans to visit Ha Giang and Ha Long bay. Due to the incoming storm we were considering skipping both and flying out to Da Nang and then Ho Chi Min, as it’s outside of the typhoon path. It’s still raining in both those cities. I know its hard to predict anything regarding the weather, but does anyone have advice/recommendations. Flying back home on 7/26.

                              <span>As title, why are crypto always mentioned when someone ask about sending money aboard? Setting aside the volatilty of crypto (stablecoin isnt stable, binance is not infallible, etc etc), how can you explain the origin of that money? While it is not universal, im pretty sure that there are strict anti money laundering laws in EU/NA. Wouldnt you be forced to declare/taxed on that amount? As crypto gains is taxable.Also, wouldnt it takes a lot of effort to figure out how to do the crypto trading? As there are easier, legal means available (ATM withdrawal with Master/Visa), or plain old Western Union, bank wire transfer? If you want less fees, then there is also currency swapping. 
 Edit: i mean here in reddit. I have seen quite a few posts in here that have comments about using crypto as money transfer method.

 I am writing a Vietnamese-Chinese cookbook. I am curious and wanted to write about dishes and their recipes that have derived from Chinese cuisine. I am sure that are a lot of influences from them. Can you please list the dishes name in Vietnamese language and English translation.
 Can you also put in local links where to cook these dishes?
 Thank you so much for your help.

 I&#x27;m trying to help my niece (who is a local Vietnamese and can speak English fairly well) find a job in interior design. She&#x27;s a recent grad from a school called https://www.vlu.edu.vn/

                              <span>Hi all you lovely people!
 I have a question, and I hope I don’t sound ignorant. 
 In the United States, the Vietnam war is easily the second most taught war (only behind WWII) in the 20th century. 
 The blunders, the brutality, the cost of lives on both sides (with an emphasis on Vietnamese citizens) , and whether or not it was needed to check communism (and if it had any effect in doing so) are all frequent topics in history classes. 
 So to the question - how is the war remembered in Vietnam now, and what’s the general consensus on the long term impacts?
 Apologies again for any potential ignorance, but the beauty of reddit is the ability to get information from people you wouldn’t normally meet, and this is a topic I’m genuinely curious about. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, Is anyone here familiar with ATM procedure? My dad forgot to take the card out within the time frame so the machine “swallowed” it. Now, it’d be easy if the card is in my dad’s name. It belongs to my aunt, who moved to the US 8 years ago. It’s her retirement. (In her not so bright moment,) she authorized it to my uncle, dad’s brother, because he lives in HCMC where she got paid from. Đông Á made them signed a separate form of the bank and kept it. Aunt and uncle don’t have a copy. They trusted Đông Á bank when the bank said they only need the government authorization form. Now they wouldn’t let my uncle get a new card. Mind you, the card has to be renew every 4 years and uncle successfully got a new card for dad once. Now the bank did a 180 saying we need to find the person who filed the bank’s form or have the copy in our hands. It’s so ridiculous and we’re at lost. We don’t have immediate relatives working at Đông Á so aunt will have to pay at least $1500 to fly back and sign the form. TL;DR: Đông Á bank asking for a form they have on file to make a new ATM card

                              <span>Hey guys! I am trying to transfer about 500 GBP from a Vietnamese bank account to a UK bank account. From my research so far:
 - Both Wise and PayPal are unable to do this because they don&#x27;t allow you to pull money out of a Vietnamese bank account, they only allow sending money in from the UK
 - I found a service called Ezyremit, which is a Vietnamese fintech company based in Australia. Has anyone used this service before and how reliable is it?
 - Is there any other way? I heard that there are some banks that allow you to do this with low fee like HSBC or CitiBank, is that true?

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am a type one diabetic and in Vietnam for the next 3 weeks. After a scary bout of low blood sugar/food poisoning I need help finding Baqsimi. This is a life saving emergency sugar that&#x27;s given through the nose. 
 I have tried three pharmacies (two local ones and one pharmacity.) I haven&#x27;t ran into anyone who has it, can order it or speaks English. 
 Every time I show the counter person a picture they just shake their head no. 
 Would anyone know how to track some down in Hanoi? Would I need to go to the hospital? 
 Please excuse my ignorance. I appreciate any help.

                              <span>So I spent a month completing the Pimsleur course for Vietnamese. Unfortunately, there is only 1 level for Vietnamese, where there is typically 5 level. I just came back from a 3 week trip to Vietnam to visit from family and the Vietnamese study prior to going really helped. Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do regarding studies, I liked using pimsleur since it has a structured course to work through and it gives a lot of practice for listening, speaking and writing. Should go back to the basics with grammar textbook or continue to more digital or audio courses?

                              <span>I am a dual citizen, Vietnamese and Canadian. My Vietnamese passport will expire in Nov 2023. If I want to visit Vietnam next year, what are my options? Renew my Viet passport in Canada can be pretty expensive (CAD$300+) and I feel like I got scammed. I know I cant renew one in Vietnam and send it here by mail. Thanks!!

                              <span>I was talking to a few Vietnamese relatives of mine when I heard about a ranking system that was put in place after 1975 that restricted people from getting jobs or into colleges.They called it &quot;chủ nghĩa lý lịch&quot; and apparently it was from 1 to 14, with 1 being the most advantageous or privileged while 14 was highly disadvantaged. The only information I learnt from them is that my family was 13 and 14 was for Chinese. 
 Does anyone know what the other 12 ranks are and what they mean? I haven&#x27;t been able to find a definitive source listing all of them out, both in English or Vietnamese.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am planning to move to Da Nang soon for work. The thing is I am only able to rent an apartment in advance through an agent without seeing everything in person.
 Anyone has a good tips to make sure the whole process is as smooth as possible and the most important thing is not to get scammed.
 I know I should probably get an Airbnb but there are also overpriced problems, fake reviews, bad experience on that app as well. 
 Thanks x 10000. I really appreciate any help and advice.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 You probably have heard this phrase many times. And as a Gen Z, I&#x27;m very sick of it. Like somehow, we become the center of all the bad things on this planet.
 I have many friends who are at my age or younger, and they had already achieved many admirable achievements. The achievements that (in my opinion) could be only in the dream of many people. And that was just in my circle of friends. On the daily news, there were also many youngsters who were managed to bring the pride for the nation despite of their young ages. They might be hard working students, talented athletes, or sometimes, dedicated teenagers who just wanna make change to this world, etc. 
 And after all of that, people choose to pick some of the &quot;thành phần bất hảo&quot; (undesirable person) to represent our whole generation. I mean, what make people think their generations are so superior ? And it is even more annoying when it comes to real life. Some of my &quot;non gen-Z&quot; colleagues in my work place even use that thinking to make fun of my every single opinions. Like... That is how your &quot;grew up&quot; ass should behave ? It is like... people need a dumpster for their toxicity, and somehow, we have become the main object for that.

I’m a single guy and I like to go out so always the possibility I will end up bringing someone back to hotel which seems like not allowed in hotels. Is this only talking about bar girls? Is it only 4/5 star hotels stopping people from bringing guest?
 Saw list online of guest friendly places but don’t want to be limited and most weren’t very nice or had poor reviews.

                              <span>My partner and I are planning our first trip to Vietnam next February and trying to plan our time as best as possible. We want to ensure we get as much in as possible, but we also worry we are moving too fast and not stopping to enjoy each stay enough. I wish we had more time, but we will head to Thailand after this trip and visit family. We will spend roughly ~18 days in each country.
 Nothing is set in stone yet as we are still researching and planning. We would love an outside eye from people with more experience than us. 
 Things we&#x27;ve considered but currently don&#x27;t have on the itinerary as of now, include Sa Pa and the Ha Going loop. My partner is not thrilled with the idea of motorbikes...
 ​
 ​
 Our Current Itenary:
 Day 1 Fly into Da Nang -&gt; Bus to Hoi An
 Day 2-4 Hoi An 
 Day 5 Bus Hoi An -&gt; Hue
 Day 6-7 Hue
 Day 8 Fly (Sleeper bus?) Hue -&gt; Hanoi
 Day 9-10 Hanoi
 Day 11 Bus Hanoi -&gt; Tom Coc
 Day 12-13 Tom Coc
 Day 14 Tom Coc -&gt; Hanoi
 Day 15-17 2 night 3 day Lan Han Bay Cruise
 Day 18 Fly Hanoi -&gt; Bangkok 
 ​
 Any advice or help would be much appreciated!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m looking to ship one medium sized suitcase (43 x 60 x26 cm) from Vietnam to the US at the end of this month. I haven&#x27;t packed and weighed it yet but I&#x27;m hoping 25 kg or less. It&#x27;s too small to move with one of the big international moving companies like Asian Tiger. Does anyone have an experience with companies like ShipMyBag or mybaggage or DHL for shipping luggage out of Vietnam? I&#x27;m interested in:
 (1) price
 (2) how long it took/if anything was lost or damaged
 (3) experiences with customs.
 It would be mostly clothes and souvenirs, no food and maybe a few electronics.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m coming to Vietnam for a month traveling north to south, still in the planning phase but we plan on doing a lot of day hikes and explore outside the main tourist areas, and do some activities like kayaking.
 Usually packing for holidays are quite easy for me to decide but I&#x27;ve never been to East Asia, and the hot weather and possible lots of rain? Makes it hard for me to decide, plus I like to travel light. 
 Warmth wise is there a chance of it getting cold anywhere in August? I&#x27;m wondering if to bring a fleece or micro fleece and a synthetic padded jacket, or if a fleece and windproof jacket might do. Also probably pack a bunch of hiking shorts and 1 pair of hiking trousers.
 Coat, I have a high end thick shell raincoat, under arm zip vents, dosent pack so small into a day bag though, great in the wind, but can imagine sweating loads if it&#x27;s warm and I&#x27;m walking. I have been meaning to get a lighter rain jacket so not sure if it&#x27;s worth getting one instead or if a poncho will be my best friend?
 Shoes, I&#x27;ve got some rugged Sandles, they seem good for the citys and and anywhere near water. Daily shoes though not sure. Hiking can it get really muddy? Hiking boots seem good but annoying to carry around when not in use. Waterproof shoes I imagine feet will get super hot. Or my usual all rounder shoe is my hiking trainer. It&#x27;s meshed so keeps my feet cool but takes forever to dry usually, and won&#x27;t handle heavy mud/rain well, can combine with waterproof socks. Although if it&#x27;s 30+ degrees maybe they might dry quicker? Or if there&#x27;s any type of fast dry hiking trainer people recommend? Any tips for an would be much appreciated. Thanks

 Hôm nay (14-7), phiên tòa xét xử vụ án &quot;chuyến bay giải cứu&quot; tiếp tục phần thẩm vấn để làm rõ hành vi đưa, nhận hối lộ của các cựu quan chức.
 Lời khai tại tòa những ngày qua cho thấy trong đại dịch các bị cáo là quan chức của nhiều bộ ngành ở trong nước nhận hối lộ của các doanh nghiệp để cấp phép &quot;chuyến bay giải cứu&quot;.
 Còn ở ngoài nước, một nhóm bị cáo là cựu cán bộ ngoại giao nhận &quot;bôi trơn&quot; theo kiểu đếm đầu người, thậm chí thu tiền thừa của các công dân mãn hạn tù về nước rồi &quot;ăn chia&quot;.
 Chia tiền theo tỉ lệ chức vụ của các cán bộ
 Ông Trần Việt Thái khai được bổ nhiệm đại sứ đặc mệnh toàn quyền tại Malaysia từ tháng 5-2020. Ông là người chịu trách nhiệm chính trong việc tổ chức các &quot;chuyến bay giải cứu&quot; đưa công dân Việt Nam ở Malaysia về nước khi dịch COVID-19.
 Đại sứ quán Việt Nam tại Malaysia đã tổ chức 21 chuyến bay đưa công dân về nước, trong đó có 8 chuyến bay đưa 1.891 người đã chấp hành xong án phạt tù về nước.
 Ông Thái cho biết để tổ chức các &quot;chuyến bay giải cứu&quot; đưa người mãn hạn tù về, ông đã chỉ đạo Nguyễn Hoàng Linh và Lê Ngọc Anh (cán bộ đại sứ) đi khảo sát tại các trại chờ để xây dựng kế hoạch, phương án và đề xuất kinh phí các mức thu, chi.

                              <span>My friend and I fell victim to a new strategy that they use to save money. Our flight was scheduled for 8:35am and upon arrival at 6:15, they apparently cancelled the flight and that it was at 6:25am. Which means that we were too late to check in. Our travel agent checked on her end and says it still showed the original details. 
 Consequences: we miss the first flight, schedule a last minute flight with a different carrier, eventually missing the second leg of the flight because of the delays. Total cost is 260+160+90USD to get to where I need to be. 
 Their reasoning: they provided ample notification so they were not liable for us checking in “late”. No refund. For the second leg, our flight was within 3 hrs of the next leg “according go policy”. They pulled up the relevant article on their website. No refund.

                              <span>Just came back from a summer trip to the US and the washer and dryers are just superior to anything I’ve used here in Vietnam. I have an Electrolux washing machine and it takes forever to do a load and doesn’t clean soiled articles well. And a Candy brand dryer which doesn’t dry by air but by heating the drum and evaporating the water. Also takes forever to dry clothes/ blankets. 
 Does anyone know of any options in Vietnam for washer and dryers that are similar to what you would find in the US?

                              <span>I have been watching the series of videos about this recent fire on youtube. The first video shows the fire already established and locals rushing to save their livelihoods. There is one particularly sad scene where a man and his son rush to the fire carrying bowls of water. The man, intent on not spilling the water, finally pauses and looks up at what confronts him. You can see the despair in his eyes; the exact moment when he gives up against the impossible odds against him. Locals rush to and fro, helping set up the fire hoses, rushing in to battle the flames in any way they can, mostly getting in the way.
 The second video is of the aftermath. OP chats with one of the boat owners (I think, I have no Vietnamese unfortunately). What strikes me is the seeming lack of anger or sadness. It …</span>

                              <span>I’m french born vietnamese and l’m planning to move to vietnam (with my boyfriend) because my mother is living there. I can speak and write in vietnamese and french fluently so I think is a plus for me to find a job there but what scare me the most is the work field that i’m actually in. I’m working in printing industry and from what I saw, the market is really saturated there (too much small and middle size company) and my profile is not that exceptional to compete with someone with the same skill but cheaper. So what kind of arguments can I give to recruiters to convince them to hire me ?

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I&#x27;ll (34M) be in Da Nang the second half of October and deciding which area to stay in. Trying to avoid overly touristy areas. I&#x27;d prefer to bike/walk to most places and to stay close-ish to the beach. But, if there&#x27;s a &quot;better&quot; place to stay further from the beach, I&#x27;m open to it. Priorities are proximity to (mostly) non-western restaurants, bars, coffee shops, historical sites—you get it.
 My biggest priority though is meeting people. I&#x27;d really like to meet some locals and travelers at bars, non-western restaurants, meet-ups—wherever. I have a bad habit of exploring cities by myself and am actively trying to change that. Looking to meet people and have a good time, but not necessarily party/go to clubs. I heard Oi Bar was a good place to start. Any and all recommendations are appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>I am born in France with all my family being french, apart from my mother who is half french half Vietnamese, the mothers side having fought the french and her fathers side having fought and most probably in charge of various atrocities. 
 Since this sub seems open to a lot of various questions from all different sorts of people I wanted to have your opinion and thought about how french Vietnamese people are seen/treated in VN and how you feel as someone with a similar background. But this question originally came to me when I thought to myself
 &quot;Will I be seen with any disdain or ill treated if I am found out to be french when I eventually decide to go to VN?&quot;
 (I look very much European, but would be capable of hiding the fact that I am french as long as my passport in not required) I meant this with every ounce of respect. Thank you very much in advance. Bon jours de la Bastille en passant!

 I inherited this box from my (Eastgerman/GDR) grandmother. Who told me once this was from a friend in Vietnam? Can you help you me decipher what is being written here and/or what is displayed? 
 It is obviously a war scene with the airplanes and paratroopers in the background?
 Hope this is an appropriate request for this sub.

 As is well known, Vietnam and China had a war in the 1970s，China calls this war a self-defense and counterattack war.【I would like to make a statement first that I support Vietnam.】
 According to the Chinese, the cause of this war is the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese have made mistakes, and the Chinese should teach the Vietnamese a lesson
 But in reality, it was Deng xiaoping who joined NATO, and this war was a show for the Americans

 Personally, I haven’t had McDonald’s in the past 3 years I’ve lived here, so I had to try it once just to remember how equally shit/delicious it was.

                              <span>It&#x27;s an often overlooked event of colonialism in Vietnam. Even in VN&#x27;s history lesson the teachers only talked briefly about it and not much is discussed about them at all here. Japan is well-known if their brutality in WW2 - often surpassed in the French in terms of exploitation and cruelty. Yet, most VN seems to have forgotten about them
 What&#x27;s your take?

                              <span>It was for survival.
 &quot;North Vietnam&#x27;s victory made the entire nation poor and undeveloped.&quot; is what the extreme anti-communists keep saying. To be honest, when the US army came to Vietnam with the intention of destroying the Vietnamese, thinking about your wealth seems luxurious.
 Here is the list of 33 massacres I found that were perpetrated by the US, the RoV and the South Korean armies.

 Image of My Lai massacre, the clearest evidence of US war crime
 The Vietnamese fought simply to save their families and their own lives. If the enemies are going to kill you, what&#x27;s the point worrying about money?

                              <span>Hey I&#x27;m trying to see people&#x27;s opinion on this guy, Ive been watching his stuff now and then, knew him through his brother (an icon in vietnamese esports scene), I watched him go from a standup comedian to now doing mostly controversial videos. Most internet users in Vietnam arent that well educated, these people usually comment &quot;reactionary&quot; under his video or just casually insult him because of his disability. Now, personally, I partially agree with what he&#x27;s saying in his videos and I feel great that someone living in a society like Vietnam is brave enough to put out their different views, actively pointing out social, cultural flaws of the system (sometimes exaggerated though). I may be pretentious here but I consider myself a better than average young vietnamese person in terms of education, understanding of freedom of speech and open-mindedness, it would have been nice to have some meaningful polite conversations about his videos but as of right now, Vietnam is not at that level yet.

                              <span>In 1968, South Korean Marines bombed the Phong Nhị and Phong Nhất villages using mortar rounds, and claimed 70-80 civilian lives.
 Widespread accounts of sexual assault also exist, with some studies estimating that up to 10,000 Vietnamese women and girls were raped by South Korean soldiers.
 Korean forces are alleged to have perpetrated the Binh Tai, Bình An/Tây Vinh, Bình Hòa, and Hà My massacres

                              <span>I’ve heard that Hanoi and HCMC have differing pronunciations/accents. How does Da Nang/central Vietnam compare? Is it more like southern or northern Vietnam? Thanks!

                              <span>As an American, we hear so much about the veterans of the Vietnam war facing PTSD, housing instability, prejudice etc. I’m curious about what life was/is like for the Vietnamese men and women who were involved, especially whether they experienced PTSD or something similar.
 Are there any books, films, interviews about what they had to go through? Anyone with anecdotes from friends or family members that you’d be willing to share?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 Need honest and straight forward advice please.
 My girlfriend is Vietnamese, and I am looking to settle in Vietnam as my girlfriend don&#x27;t want to move overseas. I currently visit Vietnam every 2nd month on tourist visa.
 I don&#x27;t want to marry her just to buy a property sooner so looking for ways to find a property. I want to marry her at the right time and for good reasons.
 - Searching online doesn&#x27;t help as I have only been finding properties in USD
 - I will happily buy property together with her as long as it&#x27;s in both of our names and not just one name only
 If anyone can provide any guidance - I have simply read that foreigners can buy property in new projects/developments but that doesn&#x27;t help much as all the properties advertised in English seems to be spiked in price in USD.
 Would prefer property price of up to 1.8 billion VND and if I/we can get a home loan too, that would be absolutely perfect

And to be honest, I think we should cooperate more closely as long as have common enemies like North Korea and especially China. Vietnamese friends, what about you?

                              <span>My wife’s iphone was stolen from the old quarter in Hanoi. This happened a block or two away from the water puppet theater. The thief took great advantage of us being vulnerable as it was raining, we were trying to manage our two kids and looking for a place to eat. Find my iPhone located it near a pawn shop 3 kms away from where we were. We were so tired and frustrated from our trip + the hotel staff advised us that there is no point pursuing the phone or the police. Later, a shop owner told us to w should have gone to the police and they might have been able to help. Whatever. Now we are back in our country. It is what it is but as much as I don’t want it does affect our emotions and feelings towards Hanoi and touristy areas. This can happen in many places and in many countries but still when it happens to one personally, it’s hard to not be biased. We had overall pretty good time in Vietnam, esp in Saigon and DaNang.
 Have things like this happened to any of you?

                              <span>My family is in HCM for 2 weeks and my little sister is bored to death with the sight-seeing and stressful shopping at big marketplaces. We found a cute stationary/gift shop called Ốc Sên Shop that she absolutely LOVED and a cat cafe that featured rescue cats which she stayed hours at. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations of activities or shops that are similar? We stopped by Rách Gia earlier last week and found a boutique called Barbie House which she also expressed interest in. So I guess any cute gift shops / clothing boutiques / fun activities around here that would interest a late teens sister. 
 Thanks in advance!!

 In my culture this is not really a thing, and we don&#x27;t usually bring gifts... but I know it&#x27;s common in southeast Asian culture and I don&#x27;t want to offend anyone.
 My gf is telling me I don&#x27;t have to bring anything, but her sisters Vietnamese boyfriends all brought some food or alcohol the first time they visited her family according to her lol.
 I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for several months now and known my gf for over a year.
 Any help/advice is appreciated:)

 I was just focused on developing my career and achieving &#x27;white people&#x27; success in mum and dad&#x27;s eyes I didn&#x27;t really put in the effort to connect ... I came by this track recently and it got me in the feels:

 Does anyone feel like they could have put in more effort into learning Vietnamese to connect with family members now that we&#x27;re older (25 and up) ... sometimes I feel bad about this 😕

 From my experience, restaurant tips are definitely not expected. Taxi drivers, grab deliveries: sometime, e.g. when you let them wait for too long. How about hotel people, airport people, rental agents, barbers, etc …

Any interesting suggestions...something that might not take up too much room on a carry on bag? What might she appreciate and/or actually use? Maybe it would be better to find something in Vietnam for her that would be appropriate?

                              <span>When you go to a Vietnamese restaurant do you stand at the door and wait to be seated or do you just go in and sit wherever you like?
 In the US we always wait to be seated unless there is a sign that says &quot;seat yourself&quot;.
 I&#x27;m a bit awkward so I don&#x27;t want to just stand at the door like a moron waiting to be seated if I&#x27;m supposed to just seat myself anywhere.

                              <span>Currently, all over the world are having a headache about the problem of underground pollution. The cause is caused by human production activities such as the use of chemical drugs into the ground too much.Causing the phenomenon of barren land cannot be reused and that land becomes dead land. With the current population growth, the food problem is also a major problem, if the land cannot be reused, it will cause food shortage problems, and may also cause groundwater pollution in the underground.

 I hope you&#x27;re well.
 I&#x27;m going to be in Vietnam for a few weeks in August and I was thinking of catching a train in a direction, for the experience of having done it. 
 But I find myself stuck on which direction to go! I&#x27;m thinking of Hà Nội to Đà Nẵng or the other way around. What do you think?

                              <span>HI, I need an app to link a foreign card to it and make payments cashless payments, such as sending money from my foreign bank card to Vietnamese nationals&#x27; bank accounts.
 Asked some wallets such as Momo and Vnpay, they support only Vietnamese cards.
 Tried Paypal the fee is ~34% (took 0.34$ from 1.00$ test payment, also put the amount on hold for the reciever), so I&#x27;m looking for cheaper options.

                              <span>Hello friends
 I will be visiting Hanoi in September. I am looking to book a cruise to Halong Bay. I can see that there are loads of cruise operators and website advertising this. How do we check if they are legit, and what scams should we look out for? The reason why I am asking and abit weary is when I booked my hotel, my phone has been getting messages non stop from the hotel, telling us to book a tour with them instead and warning of scams from other operators.
 I am interested in this tour company is anybody able to tell me if it’s legit?
 https://www.cruisehalongbay.com
 I have attached some screenshots about some registration number that this business posses.
 Thank you very much!

                              <span>I am traveling in vietnam for the first time and I am overwhelmed by the country, the people and their warmth and friendliness and the food. Now I was a few nights in a cute homestay. I wanted to extend this by one night, but I could not, because the room has already been booked again. Now they have offered me a small apartment, which I gratefully accepted. I was brought there by a friend of the owner with the motorcycle (about 10 minutes drive). When I asked her how much I should pay for the ride, she replied that she wanted nothing. Tomorrow I will leave this apartment again. Now my question to you: should I leave her the money for the ride tomorrow or just a small tip for the apartment? If so, how much would be appropriate? Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Every time when the yearly mass military recruitment wave is approaching, people would bring up this topic to debate but after 1 or 2 weeks it&#x27;d fade away. Supposedly it&#x27;s a major reason for people to bribe out of the service and funny enough it&#x27;s actually easy to avoid the mandatory calling.

                              <span>What do you recommend as bank for foreigners that can do money transfers to international accounts via their online platform? Because I&#x27;m so done with HSBC.
 I&#x27;ve been with HSBC for 4 years now for my salary account and their customer service is utterly disgusting. After 4 calls, 12 emails and a visit to the bank, they still aren&#x27;t able to address my concern. My credit card will be blocked two days from now, and I had submitted all the documents 2 weeks before, but they still aren&#x27;t processing it. All the email replies are canned templates and calling their hotlines cost a lot because it&#x27;s just recorded music. The customer service representatives are clueless and they just keep repeating what is written on the website, and not answering my questions. It&#x27;s so tiring to talk with them.
 No wonder they have mostly 1 star reviews on Google. All 206 reviews averaged to 1.7. What a joke for an &quot;international&quot; bank.
 I&#x27;m checking Citibank and Shinhan Bank, what do you guys recommend?

                              <span>Hi, for few months back i started to grow some passions about cinema, and i would like to go for University of Theater and Cinema, but since the date to apply already concluded.
 I have a dream to become a small director, to do a small project, some short films about my life or making a big one with the size compare to cinema. I wanted to brought our country&#x27;s film to a next level, maybe everyone are also like me, but i feel it.
 In Ho Chi Minh, is there any training center or other College i can learn to be one, from the techniques to using cameras, edits,... So i can know the details in every part once i making the film, now i&#x27;m already starting to develop some scripts which i think it could tell something, might just a crap but it is what i love.
 I can&#x27;t thank you enough for this

                              <span>I remember when I was a kid my mom had to bring USD cash to bribe airport authorities to not steal our stuff and let us into the country.
 I heard this was common for ppl who are Vietnamese and entering into the country. 
 Is this still normal? If so, how much cash should I bring?

                              <span>My boyfriend is in Vietnam with a group of guy friends and I saw a reddit post saying if you go clubbing with a group of guys, the girls that work there will accompany them. Is this true? How does it work? I trust my boyfriend but I don’t trust the strangers that could possibly spike his drink and I’m uncomfortable about the fact that they’ll have sexy women keeping him company.

Is there a Vietnamese word to refer to the current counter-culture? (I.e. tattoo, graffiti, dark music, extreme art etc) thanks 😇

I was born in USA and am currently traveling Vietnam from north to south solo without any restrictions and bias opinions from my family to have fun and explore my roots.
 My family escaped from Saigon to USA. They tried their best to give me a Vietnamese upbringing. I remember that it was going well. I started to hang out with my cousins who were born in Vietnam and came over to USA when I was in elementary school. I was bullied by how I spoke in Vietnamese and never felt fully welcomed by them. I moved away from an Asian community in middle school and was bullied for being Asian. There were few Asian people but they somehow fit in with the white or black crowd. I mo…</span>

                              <span>Vietnam is in my bucket list for a long time. This big country cannot be explode in 7 days so I have decided that I will travel and in between I have to work. 1. If I take a tourist sim card with 5G is it enough to connect my laptop and work ? Mostly IT work in Google Chrome and some software. No video upload etc. 2. Which sim card to take for this 30 day plan ? 3. I see lot of buses operate in cities. Are these AC buses, operate on time ? (Or like Indian buses. No schedule). 4. For travel between cities how early I need to book train/bus ticket ? Which website can I use to book ? 5. Any concern on snatching/pickpocketing? 6. My plan is saigon - DMZ - da nang/hoi an / hue - Hanoi - ninh bin - cat ba island. Is it ok or shall I add something? Exit from Hanoi airport. Max I can spend 3 to 4 weeks. In between I have to work full days :( 7. I don&#x27;t speak vietnemese at all. Will there be issue with ordering food with street food vendor? Thanks.

                              <span>Da Nang has been showing me so many new things. Around ~9-9:15pm on Cầu Rồng, there was a bunch of motorbikes speeding (like i have never seen vehicles go this fast in Vietnam&#x27;s big cities) down the bridge with guys on the back whipping belts out. Eventually, one guy is on the ground with his bike knocked down, getting beaten with belts. The perps take off, leaving the guy curled up in fetal position. This all happened in the middle of moving traffic.
 I guess....WTF??? I&#x27;m assuming this is a one-off but seems very bold to be doing it so publicly.

Unfortunately mostly when searching the only ones that come up are war related, for which I have no interest in rehashing. Ideally I&#x27;d like to find content thats more in depth on the culture, not just random tourism focused stuff.
 Any recommendations would be appreciated. Likewise if there are any better news/current affairs publications beyond VNexpress/TuoiTre that would also be great.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about this statement. None of my Vietnamese friends have been able to give me a concrete answer yet...
 Why is it that every conversation I have with older folks here (male or female) seems to go in the exact same direction? How long you been here? What is your job? How old are you? Are you married? NO?! Then they insist I marry a Vietnamese woman.
 Sometimes it&#x27;s a quick, lighthearted suggestion but then other times it&#x27;s a full on sales pitch. One old man told me that he likes the look of western women, but they don&#x27;t age well like Vietnamese women do so I best take up a Vietnamese wife... which I found very funny. 
 So why do you guys think this happens? People seem so passionate about suggesting it to me

                              <span>I am aware of the fact that this is a common problem among every community but it seems really ridiculous in Vietnam. Whenever I play a game, I often stumble upon Vietnamese with hard swears as their username, and they&#x27;re often pretty toxic. I was playing this game about tanks, we lost the match because a guy on our team was afk. I notified the enemy team of his position and that&#x27;s when this guy, with the most original username ever, (Ditmemay12) starts to unleash his tantrum on me. He told me to shut up, I&#x27;m like what? The afk guy was the only one left on our team so I wanted to get this over with. What was he trying to do? Show his typing skills? Show how much of a failure he has become? (Btw the guy sucks at the game). It&#x27;s not the first time I have seen such behaviours, it&#x27;s everywhere. On Facebook, Discord, etc. Any social media platform that has Vietnamese. Again, I know it&#x27;s a common problem and those people does not represent the entirety of he Vietnamese community. But I feel like those kinds of people take up a hefty percentage of the community. Have anyone gotten the same experience as me?

                              <span>We have been staying in Hanoi for a week already and we are staying the next three weeks. We’ve been getting by using google translate and common sense and so far he’s tried a wide variety of Vietnamese food without a reaction. Seems like a lot of food uses soy oil so far. He carries epi pens with him.
 However, people are often confused by the translated message and we think it’s not clear. 
 Using google translate from English to viet to English, “no nuts, no sesame” returns as “no seeds. Unseasoned” which isn’t helpful at all hahaha.
 Also nuts can translate to peanuts but he is allergic to all nuts and nut oils. Sesame also seems to have multiple translations.
 A translation of something like “I can’t eat nuts, nut oils, sesame, sesame oil. Does this food contain them?” would be ideal! :D 
 thank you for any help!!
 Edit If you’re interested hes only eating a small bite of food then waiting 5-10 mins for a reaction to be safe. if he reacted he would make himself throw it up. He also has tablets and 4 epi pens. He’s also a med student.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ll be in Vietnam for 8 or 9 days in December. Packing super light and will have just a large backpack with me.
 I&#x27;m planning on flying into Ho Chi Minh city, spending a couple of nights, then I want to make the trek up to Hanoi. Does anyone have suggestions on how to do this, and what the most interesting path might be? Also is it safe to travel alone or are there some sketchy parts I should avoid?
 Ideally I&#x27;d love to rent a motorcycle and ride up myself... but I&#x27;ve never ridden a motorcycle or driven in Asia so scratch that idea. Is there some kind of boat I can take, or something? I&#x27;d love to make my way up to Hanoi over the course of 5-6 days and see as much of Vietnam as I can.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

 I&#x27;m wondering what sources of weather information you guys use to check the weather in Vietnam. And if those sources are accurate/reliable or not?

                              <span>Moving to Hanoi for a new job located in the Cau Giay district, is it a decent area to live or would a longer commute be worth it? I tend to be someone who wants to spend as little time as possible commuting but it seems to be slightly more expensive than some other areas? I hear Tay Ho is the most western area so in all honesty I want to avoid that I&#x27;m leaving Britain for a reason 🤣

                              <span>Hello guys, I am planning trip to Vietnam for 2024. The best time would be sometime between january to march, but there is also lunar year at 10th feb and I heard there is nothing todo by that time and everything is more expensive. Is that true? Is it better to come after Lunar Year? Anyway I was also googling something about Vietnam Craft Beer and beer festivals. I found something but doesn’t give much info really. Is there something like that? Could you tell me more about craft beer in Vietnam please? Thank you

 I’ve been looking a little at clothes and everything is for skinny people, is there any stores in Saigon you could recommend for bigger girls?
 Fells weird saying I’m “bigger” when I’m normal sized in my own country, but I do understand the Asian standards of being skinny.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be in Hanoi next week, and I&#x27;m interested to know which part of Hanoi would you recommend in terms of affordability, convenience, and access to great local food! 
 I&#x27;m a major fan of Vietnamese food, but this will be my first time visiting Vietnam. Are there any specific dishes that you would recommend for me to try out? The more local, the better!

                              <span>Probably one of the best buffet in Hanoi I&#x27;ve ever tried and visited
 Heartwarming and very considerate staff Price is roughly 400k ₫ per person
 I&#x27;m saying this because I&#x27;ve tried over 35+ well known buffets in Vietnam (saigon, da nang, nha trang... etc) and this buffet hits the spot. 
 Just my 2cents of course. Ps: not a commissioner but a foodie influencer on ig from america

 95% of the girls working those “booking” scams work for this group. 
 You’re welcome lol.
 These girls ought to be named and shamed on Facebook frankly. Nothing wrong with working as a club promoter but lying about it to pull guys into astronomically priced mafia dens and have their “friends” join your tab is a step too far.

                              <span>I come from a 3rd world country with not much allowance for this trip but I would like to bring home some souvenirs. I’d probably buy snacks to share or kitschy stuff for close friends. My mom wants me to buy a bag for her too😭 Any good recommendations for Ben Thahn stores or Vietnamese snacks to bring home? Or is there a better place to buy these rather than Ben Thahn?

                              <span>First of all, thanks to everyone who responded to my question about using VietJet to fly to Tokyo from HCMC. I ended up cancelling that flight and will be using Japan Airlines from Hanoi. HOWEVER, I am now stuck with a 6 hour layover!
 Question: Are there any lounges you would recommend in Terminal 2 of Hanoi airport? Would you pay when you arrive or book in advance?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My (23 F) boyfriend (23 M) is from HCM city and moved to America one year ago. We’ve been dating for over six months and the relationship has gotten serious.
 I love him (surprisingly, his family also loves me) and it’s looking like things might end in marriage down the line. I’m amazed they accept me so easily when my family doesn’t accept him, but I try my best anyway. His family wants everyone to live together someday soon. My boyfriend says no.
 My boyfriend has a rebellious spirit. His cousin bought me VN government-issued textbooks to study the language, but he doesn’t want to teach me Vietnamese manners. It leads to awkward situations with his family A LOT. He says “just be yourself, it’s America!” but I want his family’s approval.
 His parents were very poor in VN and are very traditional. My family is rich and has more advanced manners than average Americans. I grew up with my grandparents too, so I act and dress more like an older lady. It’s funny because sometimes I act like a polite American to his parents and they say to my boyfriend “she has Vietnamese manners, nice”. I’m totally uneducated but I know I offend them a little sometimes. 
 For example, he didn’t tell me I should offer his parents to eat before I eat their food. Things like that. 
 Please, if anyone has information on how not to offend Vietnamese parents, tell me. I never dress provocatively or curse, and I try to be as helpful as possible in the kitchen. My boyfriend’s family gives me a lot of patience as a westerner, but I want to do the right thing.
 Thank you 💗

                              <span>TLDR: just another diaspora’s thought. 
 For context, I am 100% local. Vietnamese I mean. I just left Vietnam last year for my study, after 32 years living in the country, Ho Chi Minh City to be specific. I had always felt “un-belonged” before whilst living in HCMC, and the biggest reason is because. I am very independent, in almost everything, mentality, finance, living style etc. I own what I say, and do. I have a big extended family with 10 uncles and aunties, and a small immediate family with a single mom and a big older brother (we are 18 years old apart). I grew up without a father, and he’s around somewhere in this country, just not around in any form. My family is very respectful, and I am very proud of them. My mother is a strong woman who went through a lot of things to raise me …</span>

                              <span>Really embarrassed to talk about this. I’m not looking for sympathy. I just wanted to warn other travellers about this.
 I’m a foreigner from London. Have been using a dating app here. I noticed there are some girls on the app who are very eager to meet right away and go for a drink. Stupidly, I agreed to go with one this evening.
 She told me to meet her around the corner from Sniff club. Met her, looked nothing like her photos (which hardly showed her face anyway). She led us to this club.
 She didn’t even speak English and we communicated via google translate…
 She said she wanted to drink champagne 🤦🏼‍♂️ so I bought a bottle. Then she asked if she can do some balloons, and kept asking for more and more. At one point she suggested I tip the bar staff. 
 She was super flirty and touching me all over. Until I said no to more balloons she acted like a grumpy child.
 I noticed some girls who were waiting on the corner, who later on were in the same club with some foreigner men.
 I am quite sure these girls are employed by the club to get men to come in and spend money. My total bill was 5 million…
 It’s a sad feeling to be taken advantage of like this. Everyone I’ve met so far has been so kind and generous to me.
 So yea, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is!

                              <span>My mom has very little teeth left. She wants to get partial dentures when she go back to Vietnam next year because of the affordable cost. 
 She has the money to get them done in the US but refuses because she wants to save money.
 My extended family is advising her to get them done in the US to avoid complications and is pressuring me to convince her. They said the dentists in Vietnam are incompetent and that if she were to have issues with the dentures, she will have to get them redo in the States which will cost even more money. 
 I understand both sides of the argument. I’m unsure what to tell my mom 
 Can you guys share your thoughts on this matter?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m currently exploring to find a new long-term home in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve been living in the Philippines for 6+ years, and one year in Indonesia, so I&#x27;m used to some of the pros &amp; cons of living in SEA like:
  
Natural disasters (PH has tons of typhoons, ID has lots of earthquakes although tbh I hardly notice those)
 Shit politics that drive you insane
 Expensive X (in PH food is overpriced AF, in Indonesia, electronic are overpriced AF)
 Terrible commute to the office if you can&#x27;t walk it
  
Hardly anything shocks me. I just go with the flow and accept the bad stuff or ignore it when possible.
 BUT of course, some things can be dealbreakers.
 I&#x27;m not in PH right now only because I lost my home in the Philippines during COVID and at this point, I&#x27;m not too sure to go back. It&#x27;s a long and …</span>

 Edit: that line of US/National bases extends from South Korea to Singapore/Malaysia. 
 There’s also a treaty in Thailand up until about 2045 iirc.

                              <span>I’ve heard that foreigner men attract lots of Vietnamese women. Do female foreigners also attract lots of Vietnamese men for long term relationships? Is it a turn off if the women make a lot more then the men (due to having an expat salary)?
 Curious to hear your opinions!
 Ps: what about Western asian women?

                              <span>In a particular marketing team, there is a supervisor who holds the same number of years of work experience as the other team members but demonstrates less competence. It is evident to everyone in the office that the supervisor is the CEO&#x27;s favorite employee. Whenever the CEO makes an insensitive joke, if the supervisor reacts poorly, the CEO apologizes. However, if anyone else in the team reacts negatively, the CEO calls them out, expressing dissatisfaction with their response.
 Interestingly, it was the supervisor who recently fired a colleague, but the CEO publicly supported the decision, attributing it to himself. This situation suggests that the CEO is protecting the supervisor by taking responsibility for the dismissal. This lack of transparency creates an unbalanced power dynamic within the office. After the incident, the office became dull.
 Moreover, the supervisor constantly seeks to know what others are doing, including questioning their work methods. This behavior can be bothersome, especially when team members are competent and experienced. For instance, one team member was surprised when the supervisor asked for assistance with a basic marketing task, such as scheduling social media posts. It is disconcerting when someone in an executive role lacks knowledge of fundamental marketing tools.
 These observations raise my concerns about power dynamics within the team. The supervisor appears to be favored, even with her limited competence, while others are held to a different standard. Additionally, the CEO&#x27;s protection of the supervisor and the supervisor&#x27;s micromanagement tendencies suggest an abuse of power.

 I’m flying to Tokyo on Monday and I found a good deal on vietjet that departs at 11:20pm from HCMC. 
 Is this airline reliable? I don’t want to show up and it 4 hours late or cancelled altogether. Does anyone have any experience flying this airline?
 Thanks.

 Are there any other verbs that have a seperate word which refers to the same action but in a different tense?

                              <span>My wife’s family is Vietnamese. When we play blackjack with her family and coworkers, they play a version where the Ace card can equal 1, 10, or 11. I’m American and the only way I’ve seen this game played prior is with an Ace being valued only as either 1 or 11. Is this normally how Vietnamese play or do they have their own rules for the game? I’d appreciate any feedback.

I can’t sleep and have woken up several times, and everytime i wake up its because of noise from the outside. Every fucking time, it’s just karaoke noise. Those men whining and “singing”. This also happened in the afternoon when they sing for the fucking NEIGHBORHOOD. I feel cold ans my head aches. Why do people love karaoke so much? don’t they have any human decency? Don’t they think about the consequences of their action?

Unfortunately only have 1 day in dong Hoi and then have to catch flight at 8 pm. I see lots of day tours from dong Hoi but not sure I would be back in time to then get to airport.

                              <span>I would like to move to Vietnam and I was wondering if anyone had an idea of the salary there for a lawyer working for one of the Big 4? I want to know how I should negociate my salary and what expectations to have. 
 Last time I went, I met a “project manager” in a construction company, and he said he was making $6000USD/month. Is that reasonable to think that I could make close to this kind of salary?

                              <span>So i found this website that shows you the freedom rating of countries around the world, and you cant even access it without a VPN if youre in Vietnam which is already a major red flag. When i go to check what our rating is its 19/100 for global freedom and 22/100 for internet freedom which is way way worse than i had original thought (Though i can’t guarantee if the data is correct or not). I want to hear about your experiences living here and about how correct that is.
 P.S the website is called Freedom House

                              <span>I know i probably shouldn&#x27;t be asking the internet, but I&#x27;m currently in Vietnam and this has become a recent problem. Two days ago i woke up with this mark after sleeping in a hotel room in Vietnam (Nortern region). I didn&#x27;t notice it until i saw it in the mirror but now it has become more irritated (probably because of the friction with my clothes). I don&#x27;t know how i got it, what it is and how to take care of it. It&#x27;s on my ribcage and is about 3 cm in hight, the redness has spread over time.
 First two pictures are current, third is what it looked like in the beginning.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I notice that many businesses in Vietnam use Facebook as their &quot;only&quot; web presence. And either Facebook Messenger, Zalo, or Telegram as the &quot;only &quot; chat app to allow their prospective clients to reach them.
 If you don&#x27;t have an active facebook account, you can&#x27;t view their content freely. Facebook would keep on pestering you to login. ( I regularly face this problem. )
 Many businesses have websites, but instead of a regular inbuilt chat feature, there would be either Facebook Messenger, Zalo or Telegram. If you don&#x27;t have one of these apps ; you can&#x27;t contact them. ( My personal experience for 3 years) 
 Does it ever occur to them that how many businesses they lose because of this limitation? Why not give multiple options to their clients? Why force them to download a new chat app?

                              <span>The karst formations in PH and TH are very similar to those in Ha Long Bay but the water seems much clearer and nice to swim in. Would it still be worth seeing Ha Long Bay after I’ve been to those places? I’ve heard the water is polluted and not swimmable. Should I spend my time seeing other part of VN? Thanks

                              <span>Hey guys… weird request/question, does anybody here have a SIM card that works in Vietnam. I’ve recently built my own computer and wanted to play crossfire like I did when I was in Vietnam, however the system requires me to text the automated sms system to confirm the account. I don’t live in Vietnam anymore and can’t figure out a way to do it online( all free websites only allow to send full number). Could I use your number to do it lol? 😅

 I&#x27;ll be arriving in Danang a bit late (9:30pm). Does anyone know if the mobile SIM card kiosks will still be open? I&#x27;ll be arriving from abroad and will need to hail a Grab to my hotel...so I&#x27;ll need data to do that.
 If not available, is there wifi in the airport?
 Thanks.

 I just got back and feel like some of my favorite places have gone downhill

 I&#x27;m planning to visit Vietnam in October. I&#x27;m preparing my trip and I&#x27;ve read plenty of recommendations on Reddit, what do you guys think of this itinerary:
 2 days: Hanoi (arrival)
 3 days tour to Ha Giang Loop Tour
 2 days tour to Halong Bay
 2 days tour to Ninh Binh
 1 day: Hanoi (departure)
 I&#x27;m missing something?
 Thank you.

                              <span>I was recently travelling in Southeast Asia and I was shocked by the behaviour of people (especially Vietnamese) regarding trash and plastic. I saw so many people (young and old) simply throwing their trash onto the street: people eating chips and dropping the bag in the sidewalk, a man putting deodorant and tossing it to the middle of the road, plastic bottles, bags, cans of drinks… basically litter everywhere. 
 This is particularly disturbing in big cities like Hanoi and Saigon, which are apparently developed and everyone has a phone and internet, but no one seems to have environmental awareness about reducing and recycling their waste.
 I can understand that old habits die hard and older people continue doing that, but the younger ones seem to follow that path as well. 
 Also, the amount of plastic is insane. Is there really a need to get a drink in a plastic cup, inside a plastic bag, sealed with a plastic lid and drink it from a plastic straw? Even if you drink it on the spot and not take away, they will still put the plastic lid with a machine. On top of that, after finishing the drink, all that plastic ends up being dumped on the street.
 I’m no environmental “freak” or entitled European, but I’m genuinely curious if this is an issue being addressed by Vietnamese people (in schools, public campaigns) or if they simply don’t care. Has there been any improvement in recent years? Do you think there will be?

                              <span>Xin chào! What are nice spots/mountains for hiking in Vietnam? When I was there a few months ago, I was kinda disappointed. Not by the landscape and nature but rather by the accessibility and availability of tracks. I went hiking near Da Lat and Phan Thiet, which was great, but although the north is a lot more mountainous, they were barely accessible due to dense forests and lack of paths. Sometimes there was &quot;too easy&quot; access, which attracts tourists (e.g., viewpoint in Ninh Binh). Ofc Fansipan is an option but I&#x27;d rather do the tour by myself without a guide, also I heard it&#x27;s quite touristic. Do you have any areas or specific mountains which you would recommend?

                              <span>Hello. I would just make this post into a numbered list because I can&#x27;t organize my thoughts well. I hope someone can help us 🙏
  
My mother was born in Saigon in 1969.
 She was able to get a copy of her birth certificate from the Philippine Statistics Authority but it is illegible.
 We emailed the Philippine Embassy in Hanoi but they said there&#x27;s no report of her birth in the archives.
  
If the Philippine Embassy said her birth has no record, is there really no other way for her to get a legible copy of her birth certificate? The local registry here says she should send her personal documents to Vietnam for the correction of her birth certificate, but would it make sense to do that if her birth really has no record in the archives?

                              <span>Ok. I’m sorry for posting here but need some help. My gf is Vietnamese and I’ve asked her but… well she’s not good at this things (according to her) 
 We’re going from the new ao Tien port to Hanoi airport. I’ve googled my ass off but I can’t really find any buses form anything around that place…
 Any suggestion in what stations to check around the port? I can’t find anything. 
 Thank you. And sorry for worthless post but Im actually struggling.

                              <span>I am looking to replace a portable screen for my travel office equipment. Selection on lazada etc is very limited and weak on specs / details.
 Are there any larger electronics stores that would have such products in stock to check out in person? As an example, this is a model that seems to be generally be sold in Vietnam and I would be glad to pickup https://www.amazon.com/LG-16MR70-ASDU1-Protable-Monitor-Silver/dp/B0BZQJ5SPC
 If I have to resort to an online e-commerce vendor, is it more custom to pay upon delivery or ahead of shipping? Does not having a VN bank account usually make such transaction hard?

                              <span>Good Morning All,
 I am an American and I live permanently in Viet Nam with my wife who is Vietnamese.
 I have lived in Viet Nam for 10 years now and we recently moved here to live a more simpler life. However, I&#x27;ve been thinking about opening up my own business as I have extensive experience in my field and I feel quite confident I can make it work well.
 My question is what is the least hassle-free way of doing this. I have zero problem putting the business 100% into my wife&#x27;s name if it means less issues.
 Would this be the recommended course of action? If so, is anyone aware of the fees or capital requirements for a 100% Vietnamese owner versus a foreigner owner? Anything else that might be worth taking into consideration?
 I&#x27;m not trying to shortcut any taxes or anything like that. I have no problem paying my fair share. I&#x27;m just trying to get everything started as cost-effectively as possible.
 Thanks!

                              <span>We will be travelling from Ninh Binh to Hue in October with our 4yo, who is not fully toilet-independent and still needs help on the toilet. 
 The train is of course much more convenient logistically than flying, but I have read so many horror blogs and reviews about cockroaches and absolutely feral toilets and smokers on the train etc. 
 It&#x27;s now 2023 and I am not sure if some of the older reviews still hold. Has anyone done this recently? Should I just go back to Hanoi and fly to Hue and simply suck up the waste of a day? 
 Also, is the &#x27;rainy season&#x27; in Hue/Hoi An in mid-October absolutely awful or usually ok for tourist activities? We booked international flight from Danang before checking weather so we are pretty much stuck with going to central area. Thanks in advance for any help.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My Vietnamese girlfriend&#x27;s mom was recently admitted into the hospital for some health issues. I would like to get her Get Well flowers.
 In the past I messed up by getting white flowers for my gf on Valentine&#x27;s days. Supposedly her mom was not happy about it being white, because white is suppose to be used during a passing.
 What would be an appropriate color for flowers for this occasion?
 Appreciate the help!

Never any backing vocals from the instrumentalists and never lead singing while playing an instrument. Is it an aesthetic thing or do people just like when someone does one thing well?

Có một hôm mất điện, bà ta đành phải thắp nến lên cho sáng. Một lúc sau, có tiếng người gõ cửa. Bà ra mở cửa, thì ra đó là con của nhà hàng xóm. Đứa bé nghiêm túc hỏi: “Con chào dì, dì cho con hỏi nhà dì có nến không ạ?”. Bà ta thầm nghĩ: “Cái gia đình này nghèo đến nỗi ngay cả nến cũng không có sao? Tốt nhất không cho, cứ như thế họ sẽ ỷ lại mất”.
 Nghĩ rồi, bà liền nói to một tiếng: “Không có!”. Đúng lúc bà ta đang chuẩn bị đóng cửa, đứa bé đó liền cười rạng rỡ và nói: “Con thừa biết là nhà dì không có nến mà!”. Nói xong, đứa bé liền lấy ra hai cây nến: “Mẹ và con sợ dì sống một mình không có nến nên con đem sang tặng dì hai cái để thắp sáng ạ!”. Lúc này, bà ta vừa tự trách bản thân, vừa cảm động rơi nước mắt, sau đó liền ôm chặt đứa bé vào lòng.

                              <span>Out of curiosity, from those who have experienced any of these how effective does everyone think these following traditions are?: - Wind snatching (Dật gió) - Wind scraping (Cạo gió) - Cupping (Giác hơi) - Acupressure (Bấm Huyệt) - Bloodletting (Cắt llể)
 Do they actually help with what they intend to do (e.g reduce pain/stiffness, cure diseases, improve skin or health etc.) or are they mainly placebo from your experience?
 Context if you’re curious: I’ve lived in Australia my whole life and an currently in Vietnam to visit family after a long time. My family is very insistent on using traditional medicine techniques to improve my skin. They took me to a doctor who put small cuts on my skin all over my body, and when I searched this up I got the term ‘Cắt llể’ for bloodletting. They’ve been doing this almost more than weekly and they say that it’s getting all the bad blood out. In my opinion it’s a real pain and honestly I doubt it’s doing anything. But maybe it works for others?
 I’ve been provided wind scraping before with my family using the green eagle medicine and they said that the redder it is the more sick I am. It’s probably very red because of how hard they scrape it into my skin! It definitely helps warm you up though.
 I’m just wondering how this all is for both people who have lived in vietnam and how normal it all is. Thank you!

                              <span>For a lot of us in the west, when we feel disillusioned with the way the world is going, we take positions against our government, take up anti-establishment slogans and listen to anti-establishment music. Fashion, music and art styles are born from opposition to cultural norms and government direction.
 How do people in Vietnam (and I suppose other one-party, unitary countries) express their dissatisfaction with contemporary culture without being political about it? Are young people generally less rebellious when there&#x27;s a legitimate threat to criticising your country? How widely accepted is Vietnamese education with regards to politics and history? Do people tend to question it or accept it wholesale?
 Sorry if this is a controversial topic, it&#x27;s just something that&#x27;s been on my mind

 1) I can see lots of demolished buildings around Da Nang - what happened? 
 2) I noticed some buildings (houses mostly) are in the middle of empty urban lots - how come? 
 3) A lot of the shops in old town Hoi An sell the exact same products - why is this? Edit: by this I mean multiple stores selling the exact same T-shirt. Supply issue? Same owners? 
 4) In Da Nang lots of beach front hotels have been half built - is this because of Covid? 
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>I am coming home to the mother land for three weeks.
 I&#x27;ve been looking for things to do in Saigon and nothing really appeals to me. Obviously food and coffee culture there is amazing but what else?
 I also hate busy hustle and bustle cities. I currently live in one and want to get away from it.
 My plan is to go surfing and exploring in vung tau for 5-6 days. And then go to a relaxing resort/beach in phu quoc for 5 days.
 That still leaves about 7 days in Saigon... I wonder if I should just spend more time in vung tau and phu quoc instead of Saigon since I don&#x27;t like city/night life.
 What you guys think?

                              <span>I am Ukrainian model working in Japan. My boyfriend’s Vietnamese. He used to be a model (that is how we met and fell in love 🥰), but now he has his own business.
 He is from a business family in Hanoi. His parents studied abroad and had business in Eastern Europe. So they can speak some Ukrainian. 
 His mom’s a lovely woman. She took care of me like her daughter. She bought me new clothes, taught me Vietnamese. I feel like little princess when staying with his family.
 She told me to get into university, because model is not a long lasting career. She’ll fund my education if I become her daughter in law 
 I love her, but I’m worried she’s trying to control me. Or I’m overthinking, bc I watch too many Korean dramas.
 Do old Viet parents change behavior after a girl become their official con dau?
 Can anyone give thoughts to this topic? ESP Vietnamese people or foreign women getting married with Vietnamese men
 Are there any Eastern European girls marrying with Vietnamese here? How is your relationship with Nha Chong

                              <span>I&#x27;m going for 3 months to hanoi for work related stuff. Should I take an airbnb or search for a normal location ? I don&#x27;t know what kind of insurance there is for airbnbs, is it the same ? It seems cheaper and less complicated for me to take the airbnb but i&#x27;m not sure if I am making the right choice or if there&#x27;s any downsides to it.

                              <span>Hey all, I am visiting Hanoi during early October and wanted to know if you had any recommendations in mind for day trips? Also, how much would these day trips cost?
 I&#x27;ve been told I can let my hotel know that I&#x27;ll be gone for a few days and book a hotel elsewhere, but I&#x27;m broke and would like to use the hotel days I purchased in Hanoi if possible. Why would it be a bad idea to do a day trip anyway?
 Thank you all and happy 4th!

                              <span>Hi các bạn. Một tí background về mình. Mình đi du học Canada từ năm 14 tuổi. Đến bây giờ mình đã 28 tuổi. Tốt nghiệp đh ngành Supply Chain đi làm cũng được 6 năm ở Canada rùi. Hiện mình cũng đã có quốc tịch Canada. Vài tháng trước mình có về Việt Nam đám tang bà mình tiện thể ở Việt Nam 1 tháng để chơi. Mình nhận ra là mình đã bõ lỡ rất nhiều thứ ở Việt Nam từ khi mình đi du học. Từ lúc đó mình có suy nghĩ là mình muốn về Việt Nam làm việc và sinh sống. 1 phần cũng là vì để ở gần ba mẹ và ông mình, 1 phần là muốn tiềm hiểu thêm về ngành Supply Chain ở Việt Nam và mở rộng network và 1 phần nữa là tận hưởng những năm tháng thanh xuân mà mình đã bõ lỡ. Mình có apply vu vơ thì được 1 cty đa quốc gia nhận. Lương ~ $4000 usd/ tháng. Tầm tầm với bên này mình đang làm. Mình suy nghĩ nhiều lắm không biết có nên về hay không. Mình có ny bên này có nhà thuê có xe nhưng ngy mình thì k thể về vs mình được. 
 Các pạn có suy nghĩ gì cho mình xin ý kiến nhá. Thanks all.

                              <span>24 y/o guy been wanting to visit for a while now, but life has gotten in the way up until now. 
 I’d love to stay for 3-6 months, and perhaps visit some other countries in SEA but we will see. Maybe even 6+ months if budget allows. 
 Would this an okay budget? I’ll have around 10k usd/237,100,000 vnd saved, and hoping to spend around 1,000-1500 usd a month if possible, but can go up in budget if needed.
 I’m good with street food and a simple affordable condo/apartment that maybe has a pool or something, I’m a simple guy. I don’t shop much or drink much, but I would like to participate in the nightlife some(few beers) and maybe go on some dates etc like on some weekends. Just have a little fun I guess.
 Sightseeing and experiences.. I have a few places in mind but would love a bunch of recommendations. Id like to explore around most of the country as much as possible so hit me with suggestions of some great places you enjoy. I have an interest in everything really!
 I think that’s about it, haha. And if there’s anyone who wants to show me around/go out for some fun when I land, I’d love to meet. Thanks in advance and hope yall are having a good day :)
