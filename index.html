                              <span>They are so nice and have these big parties where everyone gets very drunk. The grandmothers are there too but they don’t get drunk. There’s always tons of food so I don’t think I should bring food. There’s always tons of beer so I don’t think I need to bring that either. Last time I brought some flowers. I keep worrying I might accidentally offend them but they keep inviting me so I don’t think I have. We live in America. I’m trying to learn a little Vietnamese but it’s really difficult—will they think it’s weird if I try to say something in Vietnamese? Edit: I’m getting the impression that more beer is alway welcome!
 Edit 2: definitely bringing Hennessy and fruit. Probably not bull penis that someone suggested.

Any red flags I should be aware of when looking at houses? I know nothing about construction quality and the overall home purchasing Process . I will be grateful for any constructive feedback. Thanks 🙏

                              <span>Hi, first time travelling to Hanoi and will be renting a car to drive by myself. I have been looking for hotel options not too far from the old quarter who either have private parking for guests. All the hotels that I have checked out on Agoda that has car park listed as a facility, don&#x27;t really have a parking lot in front when I cross checked them on Google Maps. A bit confused right now on how I should go about searching a hotel that meets this criteria, or alternatively should I be looking at paid parking lots and if those are common in Hanoi. 
 Any suggestion/recommendation is highly appreciated.

                              <span>I have the in-laws over from Vietnam. Very traditional to say the least. I&#x27;m curious where some beliefs come from, like not being able to eat something hot and cold together, one example, eating pho and then ice cream after. Taking a shower after sweating outside. And last was drinking water before or after eating mangos. I tried looking for online for explanation, but don&#x27;t find much other than the mango one being a myth

                              <span>For me, it&#x27;s the best beach I&#x27;ve ever had the chance to visit. But I&#x27;ve only visited Ha Long Bay and Sam Son Beach, and Sam Son has not exactly ever been recommended by anyone, so I think my opinion might be skewed 
 I love visiting Ha Long bay. I, in fact, has been doing it all the times, alone. I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just sentimental reasons though, It&#x27;s just that have treasurable memory there. It was a very difficult time of my life, and someone invited me to go there with them. I remember just lying on the golden sand, gazing my eyes up on the blue blue sky, immerse myself into what felt like just emptyless. A big, blue sky and a boderless sea, just made you felt wanting to melting into them, merging with them, disappear into just some bubbles with them. Just plain peace and tranquillity, some tranquillity I deeply needed that time. It calmed me down, calmed my every torments down.
 From then, I always make chances to go there, just to lie on the golden sand again. I only chose when there would be least tourists, even if that means during a storm season. Storm, brings in another kind of tranquillity. 
 But I&#x27;m afraid I might be biased. I always tell people that in Vietnam, I love Ha Long the most. I&#x27;m afraid the reason I love Ha Long is not for the fact it&#x27;s actually great there. To gaze into the endless sky, any beach would do.

 I’m currently in the Old Quarter and prices for massage are pretty ridiculous and more expensive than my hometown 😂
 What’s the real market rate? Thanks in advance! 😌

 How and where should she apply for visa to travel? Is it all lost cause at the moment due to the war?

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning on visiting Vietnam in the second half of September and want to get an idea of what kind of weather to expect. I tried googling it and got some very different answers so I thought I&#x27;d try asking the people who actually live there. Should I bring gumboots and a raincoat, or boardshorts and sunglasses?
 Is there a noticeable difference in weather between the north/central/south regions?

                              <span>LÊ Bình Giang (1990, Vietnam) was educated in Film at the University of Ho Chi Minh, but he wasn’t allowed to graduate because the script for his film KFC was considered too violent by the Council of Examiners. Lê didn’t give up on his project and tried to find sponsors. He won the Film of the Future Award at the Vietnamese Autumn Meeting 2013, which helped him get started. After making several short films he finally made KFC (2016), his feature film debut, three years later. In 2023, he released two movies, “Rock-a-bye Baby” and “Jackpot Island”

 Is there certain clubs(not partying/drinking clubs) I can join to meet new people? Or online groups or apps to use/download? How does the Vietnamese-American Center in Saigon work? I’d love to visit.
 Thanks in advance 🙏

                              <span>I am traveling to Saigon soon and will be buying seizure medicine to bring back home to the US. Is there anything I should be worried about when bringing them back to the states? I only have a script for Klonopin(clonazepam) in the US. I’d like to bring back 50 Diazepam tablets.
 Also, there will be a layover flight when leaving Vietnam to Taiwan before going back to the states. Will I get any problems at the Taipei airport?
 Would love to hear any experience of traveling back to US with medicine. Thank you all in advance!🫶

                              <span>I am viet kieu and my husband is caucasian. We adopted a viet dog /chó cỏ/ 2 years ago when she was only 3 months old. The weird thing is whenever my husband takes the dog out for a walk, people ask him if the dog was rescued, especially when the question is directly from the locals. There was also one time the vet in district 2, saigon asked us if we rescued our dog. What are your thoughts on this? Maybe I am missing something or having a viet dog is considered as a rescue act for foreigners here in Vietnam.

                              <span>I know this could be a controversial topic, but I really need to get this out there so we can hear each other&#x27;s opinion.
 I have had a motorbike driving license for 8 years. My bike is reaching 30,000 km traveled intra-city. I&#x27;ve got used to the bustling metropolitan lifestyle.
 But I cannot trust my life on the bike. I&#x27;ve realized my body is out on the open, and each day it&#x27;s like large cars are out there to get me. During rush hour, the sidewalk is the road. I cannot help but feel guilty for pedestrians who should have the right to the sidewalk, but again, my right of way is being violated by the cars too. City traffic IS deadly if you&#x27;re a biker, I cannot say otherwise.
 Why allowing such a risky vehicle to become the nation&#x27;s top chosen transport? Why putting next to none effort in enforcing helmet safety? Why aborting the trolleycars, a totally cool public transport?
 I really need to hear your thoughts.
 Disclaimer: I am not a foreigner. I&#x27;ve lived all my life in Vietnam and married to a third generation Hanoian family, whose members are exclusively chauffered or taking public transport, and advise me to stay out of traffic.

I&#x27;m new to travel but I&#x27;ve been in Indonesia the past 2 months, and EVERYTIME, the bike is faster, so I assumed that&#x27;s how it always was. Heading to Vietnam in a week, what gives?

 As u all know, Trump and co-conspirator&#x27;s mugshots were finally released yesterday and i read a report by vnexpress on this and the comment section is absolutely filled with fanatic Trump supporters, which is kinda strange and disturbing to me since i expect an isolationist president like Trump will not gather as much support in foreign countries, not to mention all of the horrible deeds he had done during and after his presidency( covid response and Jan 6th, etc)
 So just how popular is Trump in this country? Are those comments just trolls or actual opinions of actual Vietnameses?

                              <span>Returned home to see my son with a bruise on his head right close to his temple. We asked and he said he bumped into a teacher at school and the teacher slapped him. He’s dizzy with ear pain now.
 Common solution is to find the teacher and give him a chair on the head, but after the anger subsided I think maybe there could be more civilized way to solve this?
 Plan to take him to the hospital for checkups first thing tomorrow, but anyone has suggestions on what we should do? Google only give vague advices that doesn’t help much.

                              <span>In many bathrooms, there is a sign that says don&#x27;t put paper in the toilet. Obviously if I&#x27;m dropping a deuce, I use TP.
 These toilets tend to have bad water pressure, so I got to thinking while stinking.
 Am I supposed to: 1. Spray and toss the hopefully dookie-less paper into the bin? 2. Not throw PAPER TOWEL into the toilet, but TP is fair play?
 This has been bothering me for years. 
 This is much more ambiguous than &quot;don&#x27;t stand on the toilet seat&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t spray water into the power outlets&quot;

                              <span>I travel with a family member who has four names, for example, Nguyen thi lac tran. When I book plane tickets, it gives spaces to put in a first name, middle name, and last name. Flight attendant with Vietnam Airlines gave us a hard time saying her ID did not match what I had put down in the computer during purchasing but eventually let us through. How is this name supposed to be organized when the four names need to be separated into first, middle, and last?

                              <span>Hello, I am a person who loves Vietnam very much and has traveled here many times. My favorite destination is the sea in Vietnam, and I have discovered many beautiful beaches suitable for relaxation. Here are the top beautiful beaches in Vietnam that I would recommend:
 1. Lang Co Beach, Hue
 https://preview.redd.it/pwikjgdh37kb1.jpg?width&#x3D;1350&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a1c23e31562a1a517529d1b6210d53dd76dd40f5
 This is my favorite beach. Lang Co Beach is very clean and beautiful, as well as having a wild beauty. I am a person who does not like beaches that are too crowded with tourists and are interfered with by travel companies or resorts, so this is an ideal place for those who love natural beauty.
 2. My Khe Beach, Da Nang
 https://preview.redd.it/inksi4zs47kb1.jpg?width&#x3D;591&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;d44aeb8b8290eecbb18e5bd35d44ad093bd842e5
 Although it is pretty crowded with tourists, the scenery is still beautiful, and there are many exciting activities on the sea that you can participate in, such as playing volleyball, surfing, or. I highly recommend the Paragliding service Paragliding in Da Nang. Should join once in a lifetime to admire the city scenery and enjoy the beauty of Da Nang from above.
 3. Mui Ne Beach
 https://preview.redd.it/2tzaoes737kb1.jpg?width&#x3D;2048&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6b9b48b16c9be0969a10ce85e79b64b51503ee36
 Mui Ne is suitable for resort tourism, with luxurious 5-star resorts along the coast. Mui Ne Beach will give you a feeling of peace, not hustle.
 There are also many beautiful beaches in Vietnam that you can refer to in the Top 10 beautiful beaches in Vietnam. I rate the shores of Vietnam as very beautiful, and next time I will evaluate some coastal resorts for those who intend to go to the beach for reference.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ll be visiting HCMC and Hanoi in October, and have a few questions that I&#x27;m hoping someone here can help me with. 
  
Do any of the teams have HQs or retails shops that I could visit, similar to T1&#x27;s setup in Seoul? Ideally Hanoi, as I&#x27;m only in HCMC for 2 days. 
 
If not team retail shops, any idea where I can buy some team kit from other retail shops? I really like the GAM shirts, but happy to support any/all teams. 
 
Any idea if there will be Worlds 2023 viewing parties in Hanoi? English-speaking?
 
 Thank you in advance

I’ve always had a good experience with grab drivers during my 5 week stay, even outside of using the app, so I was fine with it. I called him 20 minutes before we wanted to be picked up and he calls back 5 minutes later to say he couldn’t make it and that someone else with license plate xxxxx was coming instead. I was already highly suspicious at this point.
 The new guy calls and we get into his 7-seater car (we’re with 5 people at this point and the previous guy had a 4-seater). I show him the two addresses we need to go to and show him the price in Grab. He disagreed, stating his car was more expensive as it’s a 7-seater. He came up with a lot more bullshit ar…</span>

                              <span>I recently started caregiving for an older male from Vietnam, he can’t remember quite where this came from. He doesn’t have any other tattoos/markings/ piercings and he came to the US in 1968. Wondering if this is from the war, any info would be appreciated.

(Thinking like tlinh, MONO, GREY D, MIN, W/N, Suboi, Binz, Orange, Hoàng Dũng, etc.) While he was born there, he’s been in the US for a while so he isn’t sure the best place to search. Okay if the website is in Vietnamese since he can help translate. Thank you, cảm ơn!!

He told me because my age is auspicious and will bring good luck to the new store. I myself is not religious and the asian tradition is unfamiliar to me so I would like to know more what this is all about, thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am half Vietnamese (born and raised in US) and am trying to get in touch with my Vietnamese side.
 My mother fled from the war when she was very young, so a lot of our family’s traditions and cultures have been lost on my side. 
 A lot of my female family wears jade wrist bangles and other jade jewelry. I was wondering if there is something similar to this permanent jewelry that men wear? I love the idea of wearing a jade bangle, but from my understanding it is something meant for women rather than me. I was unable to find information about this topic from Google, so I am asking here. 
 Thanks!

I’ll be in SEA for three months and, to me, that sounds excessive. Is this a necessary precaution or is there another option?

 Does anyone have a solution? Would even consider by sea.

 Thoughts and recommendations? 
 My partner has never been to Vietnam so I think she would benefit from at least dipping her toes.

                              <span>I&#x27;m really feeling exhausted with ESL, I&#x27;ve been doing it for 10 years and would merely label my talent as &#x27;capable&#x27;. I don&#x27;t particularly wish to pursue a management position. I&#x27;m in a 4 year relationship and I can&#x27;t bring myself to commit simply because I don&#x27;t want to do this job for the rest of my life. I make about 10 bucks more an hour than when I first started which doesn&#x27;t even make up for inflation.
 I&#x27;m willing to learn a new skill and study but I just don&#x27;t know what other career paths are available to expats here. For the most part, I realise that many non specialist occupations can be filled by a native who will work cheaper than I will. My observation is also that a lot of Western businesses shut down after a year leading me to think that the govt doesn&#x27;t make foreign business ownership easy.
 My question is what do I need to do to qualify myself for a job which will pay me enough to stay here? What industries can I be considering if I were to reskill?

                              <span>I’m not a Buddhist practitioner. I don’t go to temple. That being said I would like to start a discussion about monks from an observational pov. I frequent vegetarian places from bình dân food to restaurants like Bà Xã and I would frequently see monks. Nothing that sounds out of the ordinary, right? Most of the time I’ll see monks that would dine in pairs, usually eating in silence. Then there are groups of normies who accompany the monks, and sometimes one man or one woman with a monk. And this is a one time occurrence that I’ve had a friend tell me, he saw a ‘monk’ bring into a vegetarian restaurant his ‘ghệ’ and sneak in beer. He and his lover were kicked out of the establishment.
 So….. I guess I’m curious of a few things. Is it important for some people to want to build a rapport with monks? Is treating them to dinner a part of gaining good merit or something? And just how many monks out there are genuine, fraudulent, or in between with questionable morals?

                              <span>I noticed that both male and female Vietnamese seems to prefer women to be very slender. I met Vietnamese in Vietnam and in North America that prefer it when the collarbone is exposed. Seen guys deem women who were fit, to be too fat. I&#x27;m talking about an athletic girl with muscle where fat doesn&#x27;t seem to be the appropriate adjective to use. Have seen the obsession by women to have pale skin. I really want to know if guys don&#x27;t like women with curves. The hour glass shape seems to be surpassed by a slender and more modest silhouette. Just curious to know peoples honest and personal opinions along with what they believe to be the national standard.

                              <span>I am going to be in HCMC in a couple of days. Haven&#x27;t booked anything yet because I figured I could just walk into a hotel and book a room. It&#x27;s what I did 14 years ago but it just dawned on me that things may have changed. 
 I would like to stay as close to the clubs as possible so that I can stumble into bed after a drunken night out.
 Any suggestions appreciated. Aiming for $70 USD per night.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Sorry for the tourist post, but I tried asking in the stickied post yesterday and didn&#x27;t get any responses. I have recently decided to come and visit Vietnam for about 10 days and I have a few questions I thought I should ask before I arrive.
 My plan so far is to fly in to HCM for a couple of days, then head up through Hoi An/Da Nang/Hue, before moving on to Hanoi and possibly Ha Long.
 I know I can fly between HCM/Da Nang/Hanoi, but what would be the best way to get between Hoi An/Da Nang/Hue? Also between Hanoi and Ha Long?
 How different are HCM and Hanoi? Are they both worth the same amount of time?
 What is the public transport like in the cities? What is the best way to get around?
 What kind of weather can I expect during September?
 I obviously still want to be able to use my phone for internet while I&#x27;m over there. What&#x27;s a good sim card option for tourists?
 Even though I&#x27;m bound to visit some bars during my stay, I&#x27;m not much of a drinker anymore. Is there anything else that&#x27;s good to do at night in these locations that doesn&#x27;t necessarily involve drinking?
 What should I expect to pay for things like food and drinks?
 What&#x27;s the best way to see Ha Long?
 Is there any other advice you have for a solo tourist that might not be obvious to foreigners?
 Anyone want to hang out with a random Australian passing through?
 I did have some other questions, but I&#x27;ve forgotten them. Will update as I remember. 
 Thanks for your help.

He says it&#x27;s to feel healthy(khỏe) and didn&#x27;t explain further. I couldnt find anything online. Is it like a mini vape pen or to help curb cigarette addiction?

I&#x27;ll be staying in vung tau but i have so many questions, how do i overcome the language barrier and how bad is it? How do i go about setting up mobile service and can it take international calls? Do i rent a car or use grab? How are the gyms out there, are steroids legal as i am on trt? I see some really spiteful posts on here about foreigners and some really nice ones, what&#x27;s the general sentiment of Americans looking to migrate to Vietnam?
 Anything else i missed or should know? I&#x27;ve also got a dog, out here i take him on walks, shopping, to cafes with me, etc, is that acceptable there?

                              <span>Every post is just things that are bad everywhere and often worse in many other parts of the world - dirty bathrooms, unhelpful landlords, an education system that doesn&#x27;t prepare you well for the real world - congrats you just described every country on earth, but just add &quot;why is Vietnam like this&quot; at the end... 
 Can we get back to posting cool outings, beautiful scenery, awesome food shots, and other things that are unique to Vietnam and are huge parts of what make Vietnam such an amazing place? The negativity towards problems that exist all over is tiring.

                              <span>I’m an American who moved to Saigon last year, and I’ve noticed that while most places in D1 have Vietnamese names (for example Boulevard Norodom was renamed for Lê Duẩn), Alexandre de Rhodes and Pasteur streets still bear their colonial era names. Are there any other places in Saigon that kept their old names, and why did those particular streets keep their old names?

                              <span>Hi! So a little background is probably needed for this.
 I am currently living in Denmark as a sort of exchange student and recently went to a local Vietnamese place. I started speaking with the sweet lady who worked there and tried asking different things in Vietnamese. We got to speaking (it’s really funny cause our only common language is Danish, so neither of us were speaking our native tongue once we got past my very broken Vietnamese) and we had a wonderful conversation.
 At one point, after hearing my dogshit Vietnamese, but realizing I love Vietnamese food and people, she did the thing I’ve only ever seen before and invited me to her home. 
 My question is, how do you respond to this? I said thank you of course, but do people ever accept the invite? Refuse? Is it rude to go or not to go? I’m not sure if it’s one of those things people say but don’t expect a follow through on, or if it is something where they want you to come. I don’t mind going at all, but I also really don’t want to impose. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 
 Ps: lady gave me a bag of pears too and refused to let me pay. She was so nice 😭😭

                              <span>Few weeks ago, Bloomberg ran an article saying that VN is now a major game developing nation. Can you recommend me some games or game studios on Android please?
 The only game that I have and know from VN is a xiangqi chess game. I&#x27;ve only played board/chess and cognitive games, but open to try other kinds of game, just to see how good the game developing scene in VN is.
 Thanks.

                              <span>So basically near my house, there is this street food stall which I frequently visit after work to have dinner. They sell Phở and other kinds of noodle soup.
 But they also sell this dish. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the correct name for it in English, but it&#x27;s pork&#x27;s brain boiled in water and added with some herbs. It&#x27;s called &quot;Óc Trần&quot;
 So I came in and ordered a bowl of Phở. The owner nodded, signaling that he heard it. I suddenly felt the urge to eat that pork brain dish, I then spoke out loud to me, saying,
 &quot;Anh còn óc không vậy?&quot; Which is roughly translated to &quot;Do you have any brain left at all?&quot; 
 The owner looked very shell-shocked at me, looking very confused. I thought he didn&#x27;t heard me correctly, I spoke even louder, &quot;Anh có óc không ạ?&quot;, which is &quot;Do you have brain?&quot;
 The whole stall and everyone on the tables were looking at me confusingly, and the owner looked even more shell-shocked! I still then didn&#x27;t understand what was wrong, I told him that, &quot;Óc trần ạ!&quot;, which is &quot;Boiled brain!&quot;. He changed his facial expression immediately to smiling, lol
 Sitting down, I still didn&#x27;t firgure out why he and other people looking at me that weirdly. It took me a few minites to realize how horrible that could come across, lol! In vietnam, if we tell someone that they have no brain, or ask them if they have brain or not, it means that we are insulting them and telling them they are dumb and stupid! Lol!

                              <span>I moved to Vietnam a month ago for an internship. In this time i saw a few men that let one nail grow longer than the others. I think its usually the pinky finger? Now i wondered if that&#x27;s a thing, if there is a meaning behind this or of it was just an accident i saw a bunch, and then started to see more because i started to look for it.

                              <span>Like, it&#x27;s just suck. And here&#x27;s why:
  
Memorization: While memorization IS a necessary skill for real life, it&#x27;s one of the most useless one. There is loads of other skills an education system should focus on for helping students with later life. However, just look at the Vietnamese textbook. What did you see? IT&#x27;S JUST MEMORY! There is nearly no other skills. Critical thinking? Zero. Creativity? Zero. Heck, only logical thinking has some representation, and that representation is minuscule in my opnion. I can&#x27;t think of a reason why don&#x27;t they teach other skills rather than just memorization.
 Obsession over Grade: This is the worst problem by a long shot. Due to (let me check what it&#x27;s called...) confucianism, the Vietnamese people value education. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a good thing, but for some reasons, it has turned into an obsession over grade and score. And well, just google &quot;bệnh thành tích&quot; to see how bad it is. Tbh, I think it is not exactly the fault of the Ministry of Education, but it&#x27;s too popular to not mention.
 Underpaid teacher: Self-explanatory. This forced teachers to teach more in bonus class (idk how to translate học thêm, sorry) and create more stress to already stressed kid.
 Boring asf: Also self-explanatory
  
Tbf, they are trying to fix these problem, and while they are not even close to fix these, theres still some progress. Hopefully they can fix all of this in near future
 (sorry for any mistake)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen this SO many times. I rent a house, and it starts to fall apart, and they expect ME to foot the bill. Or, you make improvements on the house and they want to raise the rent because of the improvement. 
 Right now, the roof above one of my bathrooms is leaking and I need to figure that out and my landlord isn&#x27;t going to help me. I have a friend that installed ceilings in his house. When he moved out, he ripped them down and made a terrible mess for the owners to clean up. I&#x27;ll do the same if I have to.

But I know two different person being half French half Vietnamese and they both have green eyes. I wonder if it is common for Vietnamese mixed persons to get lights eyes colors ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never experienced theft firsthand before and this experience has been not so pleasant in my memory. At noon time on August 22, 2023, I parked my red Honda Wave motorbike across from Eddie&#x27;s Wok in Thao Dien. Specifically, it was a sidewalk with other parked motorbikes, so I figured it might be a parking spot, even though there were no guards. It was stupid of me to believe that surveillance cameras would deter any bike thieves. I stopped at Eddie&#x27;s for lunch and when I was done, I found my motorbike to be missing. I reported it to the authority of phường Thảo Điền and it was all that I could do. 
 I now realized that I was naive to park at a place with no security. I really liked that bike and I&#x27;ve had a lot of good memories with it. I also lost two helmets and a raincoat was on the bike. Like I said, I&#x27;ve never experienced theft before and I really hope that the police can get it back. But in the mean time, I&#x27;ve been blaming myself and the memory of the shocking realization is still coming back. What should I do?

                              <span>Hi guys!
 A group of friends and I booked a trip to Viet Nam on a whim because the flights happened to be quite cheap from Indonesia end of August.
 We will be landing in Da Lat which we were interested in because the city looks unique, and will be departing from Ho Chi Minh city. We&#x27;ll be there 28th Aug to 7th Sep. Currently the plan is to be in Da Lat for 3 nights in the beginning, then in Ho Chi Minh City from 3 Sep onwards. This leaves the 31st to 3rd on our schedule empty for potential things we can do. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do or places to go/stay on those middle 3 nights? Maybe somewhere off Da Lat and HCMC, or on the way between those two cities?
 For example we were potentially looking at checking Bao Loc out for something kinda off the beaten tourist path, but are wondering about how to get around within the city there. Is Grab readily available etc. 
 Second thing we were wondering about is how reliable the inter-city buses are. We could find schedules but can&#x27;t figure out how to book them online, so is it simple to go to the bus station and book tickets? How early in advance should we book them and do the tickets run out fast on the routes from Da Lat -&gt; HCMC? Also would you even recommend going by bus between cities for tourists with no command of the Vietnamese language save for Google Translate camera? We were thinking of going by bus for a more affordable experience and to sightsee/experience how traveling through the country by land is, but of course a plane ride between the two cities is still an option.
 Really excited to visit Viet Nam as I&#x27;ve never been there and I appreciate any help you guys can give! Thank you!

                              <span>Mình năm nay 19 tuổi, đang học tại đại học mà mình không tiện nói tên. Trước khi lên đại học mình đã mong muốn và nghĩ rằng khi lên đại học, tập thể lớp sẽ rất vui nhộn như cấp 2 hoặc cấp 3, thậm chí là hơn cả thế, nhưng mà mình đã vỡ mộng hoàn toàn sau 1 năm theo học cùng lớp. Số buổi lên lớp của trường mình không nhiều, chỉ có 3-4 buổi mỗi tuần. Lớp mình là một tập thể không đông, trước đó thì có 20 người nhưng sau đó vì nhiều người không theo được nên đã chọn đổi ngành hoặc trường nên cuối cùng lớp mình chỉ còn có 14 người. Ngỡ tưởng dân số ít thì mọi người sẽ mở lòng giao tiếp với nhau nhiều hơn nhưng kết cục vẫn đâu vào đó, ai cũng khiêm tốn và kiệm lời, chẳng có sự sôi nổi, chẳng cãi vã, chẳng tranh luận, lớp lặng im, đã vậy còn chia thành các nhóm nhỏ khác rồi chơi cùng nhau trong vòng đó (đa phần quen nhau từ trước), mình cũng có một nhóm nhưng hiện tại thì chỉ còn mình mình vì những người khác rời đi hết. Biết trước chuyện này xảy ra nên ban đầu mình có giao tiếp hay lại gần để trò chuyện cùng các nhóm khác, nhưng mà nỗ lực có vẻ không thành khi mình ăn trái bơ nhiều và các bạn có vẻ không muốn tiếp tục cuộc hội thoại. Không chỉ trên lớp mà thậm chí trên mạng xã hội, mỗi lớp đều sẽ có một nhóm zalo để chia sẻ thông tin cũng như trò chuyện, nhưng mà kì lạ là nhóm lớp chẳng ai nói cũng chẳng ai hỏi, vài tuần thì có tin nhắn thông báo sau đó lại chìm nghỉm, mình nói gì mình hỏi gì cũng đều nhận lại được đó là một đống bơ từ cả lớp, trong khi mọi tin nhắn khác mình đều thả tim hoặc rep lại để tạo sự tương tác 😢 biết là chẳng có gì đáng trách nhưng cảm giác quá đáng thật. Mọi người có giải pháp nào cho mình để có thể kết thân cùng lớp không ạ? Ai cũng bảo hãy tận hưởng đời sống sinh viên mà sao mình không thấy gì đáng tận hưởng hết á.

                              <span>I know this is a bad idea. But it was a miss on my end that I wasn&#x27;t able to check this holiday when I booked a flight. I was just excited to book since the tickets were on sale. 😂
 Anyway, fam and I will be travelling to Da Nang this Feb 8-13. Any tips on how to ensure we still enjoy the trip? Planning to stay longer in Hoi An since I heard most establishments are BAU during this time. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>What animals in Vietnam are not afraid of humans? In America, if I wanted to I could pick up a city pigeon or a goose in the park. Some squirrels will even run up to my feet in university, some people feed them. Is there any parallels in Vietnam, I know a woman who kidnapped a squirrel, but it was young and she let it go after a week.

                              <span>Suddenly feeling the urge to ask this question, because while the US is more well-known to be more open-minded about gender expression, I feel that the male beauty standard there is actually quite strict and harsh. 
 I only see the most buff, shredded, muscular guys being presented in American movies and series, and only them is positively presented. The &quot;nerds&quot; and the skinnier guys are often portrayed as a joke, a laughingstock. This might be a blindspot of mine, and I might be jumping to conclusion too early with not enough observation. But I feel the male beauty standard in the West, or at least the US, is very big, very jock-like, buff-y, brute, masculine-ish.
 And while Asia, or Vietnam, is said to be more conservative, but I actually feel like we allow men to be more things. The big, buffy with tan lines image is accepted. Also accepted is the slim, fair skin, quieter, smart, sweet and soft-spoken, &quot;thư sinh&quot; type. Nobody has to be big and shredded with 6 packs to be considered a man. Am I right about this?

                              <span>i am looking to do a 3 month trip between april, may and june 2024 in vietnam. however, i have no idea where in vietnam to go and want a physical copy guide to get a more general sense of what the different areas are like and hence what general area i would be most interested in visiting, rather than an in-depth description of what cafes and restaurants to visit in a certain part of Hanoi. 
 can anyone recommend a travel guide that would be most useful for this type of research?

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the look of the Honda Dream II while in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve seen it everywhere fron north to south.
 Google it back home (Spain) and I get lots of vietnamese results. Was this moto especifically marketed in Vietnam and/or SEA? 
 Was it marketed in Europe under a different name?
 Thanks a lot :)

 During this period I will need to spend as little as possible, any advice?
 EDIT: I’d also like to maintain health and don’t want to just live off of salty noodles etc. thanks!

 Unless you go to malls or expensive restaurants it’s clean. 
 Haven’t they heard about hygiene ?

                              <span>Just moved here. Big city.
 Local food is GREAT, but I definitely need more protein in my diet on top of that.
 Gonna start eating a bunch of eggs, but I still need protein powder and perhaps there is some local food I don&#x27;t know about?
 Something with soy maybe?

 I&#x27;m doing this so that people thinking of moving to Vietnam can ask questions, as well as locals who might be curious about my experience here.

 Also, most underrated?
 I guess they are extremely subjective, but I would love to hear people’s thoughts and opinions. 
 I’ll start - overrated - got to be bà nà hills. I know a lot of people don’t rate it to begin with, but I just think it’s got no value at all tbh. 
 Underrated - Vũng tàu, I really love this small beach town, perfect place to day trip from HCMC

                              <span>Hey there, just moved to a new apartment Hanoi and spent the whole night awake from honking and traffic. I am looking to get some moving blankets to hang up over my door and windows to block out some of the sound (pic attached). However I can’t find these blankets anywhere on shopee/figure out what the Vietnamese translation for them would be. They are extremely thick and heavy blankets and used to protect furniture when moving. If anyone could let me know where I could buy these in Hanoi/online for shipping in Vietnam that would be a huge help! Also if anyone has any recommendations for a shop in ba Dinh that could do some sewing as well I’d appreciate it.

Can you guys please suggest some ‘must go’ places and help me prepare an itinerary. I’m not much of a ‘city-wanderer’ and I’d like to be around nature and/or historical places. Also, if you could share some tips to make my travel better. Thank you!

                              <span>apologies if this is weirdly worded, i don’t know how to ask this question😅 i don’t know enough vietnamese so i will write in english. i noticed my parents will say “anh” and “em” to each other even though they’re the same age. apparently this is the convention for heterosexual couples, that the M always uses “anh” or “big brother” and F uses “em” or “little sister.” so how does this work in gay couples? do they typically both say “em/anh” or “em/chị” or just whatever they feel like?

                              <span>Anyone else notice that Vietnamese that live in America (and maybe other English speaking countries idk) will pepper in very specific English words when speaking Vietnamese? Like I get mixing the languages, especially when you’re talking to someone in Vietnamese about something that originally happened in English, but I’ve noticed that people seem to favor using the words “parking” and “move” instead of the perfectly serviceable Vietnamese equivalents, even when the rest of their sentence is in Vietnamese. Like one time a pregnant lady was talking about how she could feel her baby move and instead of saying thấy em bé đạp she said thấy em bé move (except it sounded like moo with her accent lol). Any idea why people do this?

 Chào mọi người, em đang tìm mua một bộ cờ vua (high quality một chút để tặng) do cần gấp nên mình cần tìm trong nước, vô tình thấy brand này nhìn đẹp nhưng mà mình thấy giá hơi cao, không biết là có ai biết đến brand này chưa ạ, hoặc có ai rcm cho mình biết chỗ nào ok hơn nhá/ Thank youuuu.

                              <span>i was born and raised in the states and pretty much speak only english or vietglish with my parents, i have a very beginner level of viet. i know that you are supposed to say “dạ” like “dạ có”, “thưa”, other words to show respect. but who do you say it to? is it mainly to your older family members, or anyone who’s older than you? is there an age where you stop saying dạ/thưa? would it be seen as really bad if you didn’t use these words? when i overhear my parents talking, they say it to relatives who are older than them (e.g. my great uncle) but not to everyone, for example they wouldn’t say it to an older hairdresser they know well or my elderly teacher. but they do say it to monks and nuns when we go to the temple, “dạ con đến lễ hôm nay” for example. how do you know when and how you have to use these honorifics? are there unspoken rules?

                              <span>We visited Huế not too long ago on our trip through Vietnam, and it quickly became one of our favorite stops of the whole trip. We only had one day there as our visas were expiring, but we were able to cram a good amount of stuff in to that 24 hours... considering 8 of them were spent sleeping. 
 We would have loved to explore outside of the city a little more. The walking street is small but lively, the food is incredible. One of our best dining experiences in Vietnam (I mean, seriously, bún bò Huế?) and the Imperial City is massive. One of our favorite archaeological sites we&#x27;ve visited. 
 I noticed when we were doing research, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as many searches or views on YouTube and other sites the way Hoi An or Da Nang do. It&#x27;s a shame. I think it&#x27;s very under rated. 
 Why do you think this is? We&#x27;d love to know.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am a Vietnamese American who lived in the US for almost 18 years. I will be moving to live in Vietnam for 2-3 years soon. Over in the US, I worked in a logistics company for 2 years and I have my Bachelor&#x27;s degree. 
 My cousin who is in the logistic field recommends that I teach English instead ( I do not really want to continue my logistic career either tbh) because the job prospect in VN is not great for logistics.
 However, I do not want to teach large groups of people. Is it easy for new English teachers to find jobs teaching small groups or even 1-on1? Does anyone here teaches English but only work with small group or individuals?
 I heard being an English teaching assistant was decent, does anyone have experience in this job?
 What about teaching Vietnamese to foreigners in Vietnam? 
 I am a little bit lost when thinking of jobs and it is creating some anxiety.
 Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.

                              <span>Next month I will be spending a month in Northern Vietnam as a tourist, specifically Ninh Binh but I also plan to visit other areas.
 I&#x27;m mostly planning the trip to relax and meditate.
 I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to travel up to forests with a scooter and just walk in a little bit, so I can sit there alone. Is it safe regarding animals, and how likely is it the forest is private property and I&#x27;m not supposed to be there?

                              <span>I will be in Vietnam in late September, flying into HCMC from Phnom Penh. The plan is to work up north to Hanoi, to fly out to Chiang Mai.
 I’d like to stop off at some of the best spots along the way, some are set other’s Id like to hear what other tourists/locals think. Being from the U.K., I have 14 days to do everything visa free before moving on. 
 HCMC - I’d like to spend 2/3 days here tbh. I lived in HCMC for 2 months, so I’d like to show my partner around the city, and also deal with some unfinished business (Suoi Tien!) 
 Da Lat - I’d like to spend 1/2 days here. Some friends loved it here, I believe there’s a super cool maze themed bar. I’ve heard it’s quite a touristy place. But honestly, that’s okay. This trip is part of a 40/50 day trip with my partner who has never been to As…</span>

                              <span>Hi, 
 I’m thinking about booking a flight to Vietnam in November and travel SEA countries while i’m there. 
 Do you recommend visiting North(hanoi area) or South(hcmc area)? It’ll be my first time in Vietnam and I’m planning to stay there for about a week.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 23M currently living in Hanoi. I&#x27;m the only male in my family, my mother has singlehandedly raised both me and my sister up. 
 Anyone living in Vietnam, or especially the northern part of it, would certainly understand the pressure put down on the men in the family line to get married and have children. But the thing is that I&#x27;m gay, and I&#x27;m not planning anywhere in the future to deceive any girl into a marriage with a guy who doesn&#x27;t love them, just for my selfish motivation, which is to &quot;fulfill responsibility.&quot; Despite having had many girls showing interests and some even confessing their love for me, it would just be a very cruel act to rob away a girl&#x27;s chance of true love and happiness in life just for my selfish reason. 
 And I don&#x27;t want to have any kids either, even if I&#x27;m a straight guy. But my mother is getting older too, and she does deserve having a grandchild to care for, to have someone to brighten and bring her happiness at her later years. But even for that, I could just adopt a child, there&#x27;s no need to lure a girl into marriage just to have a child.
 But I don&#x27;t even want to adopt kids. Best case scenario, I found a guy who&#x27;s my true love, we&#x27;re both financially stable enough to be able to adopt and raise a child with love. Much more likely, I would end up alone, I much more prefer it that way though. Living to the very end of my 40s, then that&#x27;s enough.
 Do you know anyone who&#x27;s a Vietnamese, who chose to live like me, choosing to live alone for the rest of their lives? Do they got respected? Do other Vietnamese look down on them?

                              <span>Seems like Nha Trang gets a lot of hate on this sub. I’ve been travelling SE Asia for a few months and decided, against advice, to stop in Nha Trang for two nights. I was super tired from travelling and just wanted to stop for a couple days before continuing on north. I actually thought it was a nice place for a stop over. It felt calm and I relaxed a bit, but I started feeling a bit disconnected after two nights so moved on to Danang.
 Pros:
  
surprisingly calm place. I’ve been enjoying sitting in coffee shops in the streets set back from the beach which were actually quite nice to explore. Quite leafy and relaxed pace after coming from HCMC which I did not enjoy.
 
nice people and a mix too. Honestly I’d heard so many negative things about Russians and Chinese. Russians largely keep to …</span>

                              <span>I like many things about Vietmam, but....
 We were in one of the huge malls (Aeon mall) to have dinner. Public dining area was packed, but we managed to fine a table. The thing is the previous customers left their trash on the table, so we asked a cleaner to clean the table. Then, the most shocking and unacceptable thing had happened. Because the tissue paper dispenser was empty, the cleaner casually and probably out of habit took some tissues from the TRASH CAN and cleaned our table. Like what in the world! 
 We just couldn&#x27;t shake the experience off and duly reported it to the mall authorities. 
 Wow! I just can&#x27;t get over it somehow. It&#x27;s like the experience has turned into a nasty core memory. 😂

                              <span>I hate propaganda as much as the next guy, but the fact that modern Viet Nam don&#x27;t have any good war, horror, fantasy, historical movies and tv shows, boggles my mind. You would assumed that with the long history of conflict, diverse culture, fantastic mythology, long history AND state funded is a thing AND modern technology AND already tried and succeed examples (see movies from China, Korea, Japan, UK) even countries like INDIA, NORWAY, TURKEY, are stepping up their game with movies and tv series. Same go for video games. Don&#x27;t even get me started on the propaganda movies, especially with the propaganda movies, propaganda war movies about war heroes are the easiest to make IMHO, should be easily State funded, so many war heroes to take inspiration from ( and if you&#x27;re saying they aren&#x27;t real because their story are too crazy, remember Hacksaw Ridge is based on a real story), so many examples from successful movies to take notes. So stop making &quot;comedy&quot; and &quot;in-law drama&quot; please.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m looking to stay 1 month in Da Nang, looking to book a 1 month rental, preferably something with kitchen. Any suggestions where I can do this online other than airbnb/ agoda/ booking? I&#x27;m looking for something on the cheap side, if I found something for 5 million I would be happy. Is it better to book online or go there and try to book it in person?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I heard this from my friend who said that he plan to save a truckload of money then move back to Vietnam and put it into a saving account that have high interest to live out the rest of his day using the interest. What do you think, can he do it or the inflation gonna eat him alive ?

                              <span>Personally I love that everyone relaxes or sleeps at noon. However, it&#x27;s not common and even looked down upon in America, I used to be yelled at by my parents for it. Just like everyone else I try to nap after lunch but I&#x27;m getting anxiety like I&#x27;m not being productive so now I can&#x27;t nap. Wondering if any other foreigners had this issue and if there&#x27;s a mental pep talk to get over this lol. It&#x27;s hot, things are closed and I want to enjoy this relaxing way of beating the heat.

                              <span>I went to someone’s house with my dad so I can at least get out and see people. Then my dad told me to come sit down at the table and forced me to eat this duck blood dish. I don’t know it’s origins and was scared to try because any raw blood can be harmful to the human body but I ate it anyways because I didn’t want to look bad in front of everyone. Now I’m home and I’m terrified for my life that I could’ve gotten infected with something. What should I know or do?

 My (31M) wife (27F) and I currently live in a HCOL area. She’s Vietnamese and immigrated to the US when she was in high school. I am Asian-American (non-Vietnamese but learning the language!) and born in the US. We are both doing pretty well in our careers. I’m a software engineer and she’s an ICU nurse, currently going to grad school to be a nurse practitioner. But the grind in America seems to have taken its toll on my wife, especially being a nurse through the COVID-era. Whenever we go back to Vietnam, I can see how happy she is and often mentions moving back there after our trips. Maybe it’s vacation euphoria but her entir…</span>

 Where do you come from, why choose VN? Im from small city, looking to move to HCMC for 6 months. Some things I’ve not learned about yet;health care system, insurance, remote jobs.

 Some fried pork puffs or spicy rice paper with some stuffs?! Oi choi oi! 
 You can talk about munchies from anywhere. One of my top top munchies is Cheez-it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning a 1.5 week long trip to Vietnam, flying into HCMC. I would most likely plan a few nights in the city to explore it, but I mostly want to spend time in nature and relax, as a mental health retreat and for the fact that I can&#x27;t walk a lot anyway due to physical issues.
 I&#x27;m looking for an area not too far from HCMC, that&#x27;s not too hard to reach with public transport of private transport. An area with some decent but affordable hotels. 
 What would you recommend?

                              <span>Cannnot send and receive SMS since Sunday 13 August. There was a small window on Tuesday night, when I received a barrage of SMS messages (including test messages I sent my self and sms messages from Three UK technicians etc.)
 While the SMS messages were coming through, I noticed that the phone network had changed from Mobiphone to Vinaphone (or similar - I don&#x27;t remember the name exactly. It wasn&#x27;t viettel.)
 Next morning when I checked phone the network had gone back to the previous automatic select setting: Mobiphone. Again, no SMS&#x27;s received. 
 I remember the same issue happened a few years ago, but it was promptly sorted out. This occasion, I&#x27;ve reported the issue to THree (UK). They are yet to revert to me with an explanation and/or workaround. 
 Anyone encounter similar issue when using your home country mobile in Vietnam?. Are you able to send and received SMS message?

                              <span>My wife (vietnamese) and I (Austrian) are thinking about buying some property in Vietnam. Possibly as investment but also as a future home for ourselves. We currently live in Europe but probably want to move to Saigon in the future to be closer to my parents in law.
  
Is there anything we have to keep in mind about the citizenship of my wife? She is thinking of becoming Austrian citizen but unfortunately Austria doesn&#x27;t allow dual citizenship, meaning she needs to give up her vietnamese passport. Can we still purchase real estate in Vietnam although none of us will be vietnamese citizenship? If we buy a property before she changes her nationality, will it have any legal consequences regarding the property?
 
What are some recommended webpages to look for properties (south Vietnam, Saigon, Da Lat) online? (vietnamese only is fine)
 
Is there any kind of public accessible data about average prices per square meter for different regions across the south of Vietnam?
 
Is it common in Vietnam to hire an agent when buying a property which does the searching for us and asks for a reasonable commission? How would we go about finding someone professional?We are not searching for and cannot afford a luxury property. E.g. I doubt we can afford something in downtown Saigon.
 
Any other obvious pitfalls that we should know of? I know that we are very much at the beginning of the process and we are both pretty clueless. I&#x27;m more of the &quot;handyman&quot; in the relationship but unfortunately I do not speak vietnamese yet and it&#x27;s hard for me to research by myself. Hence it&#x27;s a learning process that me and my wife have to go through together. 
 
 Thanks a lot for any input and help!

                              <span>My party of 4 arrived at the Da Nang airport a few hours ago. I did some research and know that I need to order car with Grab, which I did. Then I encountered 3 scams back to back, 2 unsuccessful and 1 successful. 
 The app told us to go to the pick up area, which we did. There&#x27;s a brunch of guys there, which I knew was very suspicious, so I chose to ignore them. 
  
The Grab driver then called and told me that he&#x27;s about 20 minutes away, he&#x27;s stuck in traffic and asked that I cancel the ride. I told him the app showed that he&#x27;s on the other side of the parking lot. He hung up cause my internet was shitty, then we exchanged texts where we pretty much said the same thing a second time. I told him that he is committing fraud and he needs to cancel if he&#x27;s not ready to pick us up. He then end…</span>

                              <span>For instance my elderly grandma had slipped twice in the bathroom, one time breaking her collar bone and was left screaming for hours.
 I asked my uncle why doesn’t he install a metal bar to hold onto or at least lay down a rubber mat on the tile. He said she just needs to be more careful next time and that it “probably” won’t happen again.
 I have another relative who I’ve seen text message/look at porn with both hands while driving his scooter in the middle of traffic and of course he’s been in multiple accidents but they were “not that bad”.

                              <span>Just to preface this I know I&#x27;m a sad old man and I hate fun. I don&#x27;t like drinking or going to clubs and bars so I generally avoid them. Despite this I don&#x27;t mind them existing because they are easily avoidable.
 I am currently travelling in Vietnam and it would seem that the karaoke is impossible to avoid, generally because it is so loud and there are so many karaoke bars. Here in Dalat some of them seem to operate even in the middle of the day. Even the staff at my hostel do it (none of the guests seem to participate). This isn&#x27;t just for a couple hours in the evening either, they seem to enjoy doing it constantly from 6pm to 10pm. 4 hours of this shit? Really?
 I suppose aside from ranting my question is why is everybody expected to tolerate this intrusive activity in Vietnam? Does everyone enjoy listening to this or do they just accept that it exists and move on? Also, are there any actual rules around karaoke bars I.e. when and where they are allowed to operate?

                              <span>Currently I&#x27;m 25 vietnamese male, used to get in a university but dropped out due to financial problem, just finished military service this year. I&#x27;m studying programming at a education center, and going to finish in the next 2 month.
 I&#x27;ve always want to study abroad to have a wider and better view of the world we&#x27;ve living in. And also, since I have never complete my college, I want to continute it by participating in a international university to accomplish a degree in computer science. I&#x27;m planning to actually do it by the age of 30 (I don&#x27;t think I will get married by that time). I&#x27;m just wondering is there any cases like me in Vietnam and actually get into a foreign college by 30 or older? Because when I try to google my concern, the result I get seem mostly come from already developed conutries.

                              <span>About to fly from Hanoi to Canada and got a brand new tablet still in its original packaging untouched in carry on. 
 Anyone who flew with new unopened electronics in their carry on out of Noi Bai before -- did they make you unbox your device at security to put through the x-ray scanner? or can you just scan it with the box and packaging and everything still intact? 
 Should I just store it in my checked baggages instead? The device&#x27;s battery is under 100Wh (75Wh) -- both Canada CATSA and the U.S. FAA allow it to be checked in, just needs to be turned off and well packed.

 I know in America at least Vietnamese cuisine is largely stuck in the 70s. Is this a phrase that has always existed, or is it a new word? I only really hear it from hipster white people who love categorizing and labeling things.

 . Another incident occurred that same summer.
 I’m kinda messed up by it. Anyone else?

                              <span>Hi, I am looking to move to Vietnam, but the thing that scares me the most are insects.
 What is the probability of me encountering a centipede in here? What can I do for lowering the chance of meeting them closer to 0?
 I heard there are a lot of nasty and scary crawling things around. I want to feel safe at home and not be constantly thinking of some scolopendra crawling up on me.. brrr...

                              <span>My friend is Vietnamese and is having his wedding in January in Vietnam and we’ll spend a few days doing touristy stuff before. I gotta go because he’s a good friend and plus I really want to. Problem is that I have a mild tree nut allergy and deadly peanut allergy. My friend promised he’ll translate and won’t let anything happen to me but I’m worried that either he won’t say the right thing, the chefs won’t understand what that means or there will be cross contamination because food allergies aren’t really a thing there as y’all probably know, and they may not follow strict food guidelines like they do not the states. Any tips for a fella in this situation? My plan is to stick to white rice and McDonald’s as much as possible but idk if I can do that for 10 days.

 I’ve spent the last month travelling Vietnam, starting in the north and working my way south. I arrived in HCMC a couple days ago and have noticed a ton of places have a security guard sitting on a plastic chair outside. A lot of these seem to be restaurants or higher end retailers. 
 I didn’t notice anything like this in any other Vietnamese city I’ve visited and I’m curious what the difference is. Are there a lot of thefts in HCMC? Is it to make sure nobody accosts tourists? Is it just to make places seem so fancy they need a guard? They seem to mostly be browsing their phones but maybe I’m missing something. What’s with all the protection?

                              <span>Here are my thoughts on my visit to VN after living abroad for 38 years
 1) shocked by the traffic Pedestrian and motorized vehicles completely mixed together 2) not accessible to handicapped 3) service is top notched if you interact with people on a personal level . lots of self employed people , owners are always on site and care about their business 
 I ordered a birthday cake and the bakery will deliver to the restaurant!!!!
 4) in the absence of personal interaction, people behaviour is just horrible , pushing others , never wait in line (I.e. when I was at the airport )
 5) phone service is so cheap , everyone is glued to their phone 
 6) the gap between the rich and the poor is just too much

                              <span>I just want to express my frustration that honking during traffic won&#x27;t make people go any faster. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a magical path that&#x27;ll open up. Why are we doing that? 
 I mean, we&#x27;re all stuck in the same situation, right? It feels counterproductive and just adds to the noise and stress. Anyone else feel the same?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a teacher in Brazil and I am very interested in Vietnamese culture, specially about Education. My education was in a country and time very anticommunist, and I have discovered prosperous VietNam about 5 years. My formation is in Physics, so I am a late student about Marxism.
 Here in Brazil, most of people believes USA won VietNam war and that your country is a big and poor &quot;gueto&quot;. I got surprised (5 years ago, when I began to search for &quot;where socialism works well&quot;) to discover Vietnamese heros beated the Yankees.
 I have much respect for all Vietnamese people, you are heros or hero&#x27;s sons and daughters. I want to learn much about dialectic materialism and how your children are educated to build a so great country and nation.
 Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t speak Vietnamese, so I use Yankee-idiom. I tried to learn your language, but it was hard to me, so I&#x27;m learning mandarin first, so I could familiarize with a softer tonal idiom first.
 Love and respect to you Vietnamese!
 Peace among us, war to the lords!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am travelling to Vietnam from the 2nd to the 12th Initially I had planned for go from HCM to Da Nang, chill in Hoi An for a bit and go where the wind takes me for the rest of the holiday. Ideally wanted sunny weather, heat with diving and lazing on a beach. I&#x27;ve been doing some more research and checking 10 day forecast and a lot I&#x27;ve read is that the weather is potentially going to be the complete opposite of what I was wanting. 
 Can anyone give me some insight on where else I should go for my beach holiday or regardless it&#x27;s going to be a toss of the dice no matter where I go? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Me (29M) and my partner (28F) will be spending Christmas in Vietnam this year. We are either going to be in Da Nang/Hoi An or Nha Trang. Which would be better for 2 backpackers to spend Christmas? We will probably be in a hostel and will try and meet other people doing the same as us. Just wondering which is nicer, we are not looking for a western Christmas.

                              <span>Travelling to Southeast Asia this fall and realized we&#x27;ll be in Vietnam during the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. We&#x27;re flying in and out of Ho Chi Minh City but we&#x27;re also planning to move around the country (like to Hoi An, Phu Quoc, etc.) so our itinerary isn&#x27;t set in stone yet. 
 Any festivities to check out or must-dos for Tet Trung Thu that might influence where we want to be for that day? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I posted previously about the lethal Ben Thanh market. Today I visited Saigon Centre and my faith was restored! It’s probably a tourist trap but there was many lovely vendors. No pushy or forceful people. Maybe one or two but only in the minority. I could browse easily and didn’t feel like anyone was going to shout at me. 
 I didn’t buy anything today apart from a scarf. Can anyone tell me how the bargaining works here. Some said fixed prices some said give me your price. I tried halving but some “said sorry no we cannot do it.” Then we came to an agreeable rate But it was only the vendors I purchased from. I didn’t barter with others but the price was really high for some stuff. 
 Any help?

                              <span>Hello my fellas! I am competing for a case competition, so I really need your help. The case is about fish sauce. I hope you can help me answering a few questions so that I can understand more about the market.
  
What makes you/your family member choose fish sauce? (packaging, taste,…)
 How can you tell between poor fish sauce and tasty one? 
 What do you prefer: bad fish sauce at a reasonable price or tasty fish sauce at a higher price?
 Are you willing to try new fish sauce that you have not tried before, or you’re going to be loyal to fish sauce that you like?
 What aspects of fish sauce do you care more about: smell, color of the fish sauce, or both? 
 To what extent do you think fish sauce is unique to Vietnamese daily cuisine?
  
Please help me win this case competition. Thank you! ❤️

                              <span>Tôi không có nhiều bạn nước ngoài đâu, nhưng mà chỉ là tình cờ lướt được video trên mạng nói về sự khác biệt này. Ở Việt Nam, tụi mình khi đi ăn cùng bạn bè sẽ thường kiểu gọi đầy bàn đồ ăn ra, sau đó khi có bill thì share theo đầu người. Hoặc là hôm nay người này mời, hôm sau người kia mời.
 Nhưng mà hình như ở nước ngoài không giống vậy nhỉ. Họ sẽ gọi đồ ăn của họ và chỉ tính tiền phần ăn đó, còn của mình sẽ tự trả của mình. Sự khác biệt này vô cùng thú vị, có thể cho thấy khác biệt văn hóa giữa cách chi trả của từng quốc gia. Các bạn đang sống ở nước ngoài và sống ở Việt Nam có thể bàn luận một chút không?

                              <span>Xin chào, tôi xin lỗi nếu bài viết này được viết bằng tiếng Việt kém. Tôi đang sử dụng Google dịch.
 ​
 Vừa rồi tôi có đọc cuốn “Đêm qua tôi mơ thấy bình yên” của Đặng Thùy Trâm và rất xúc động. (nếu bạn cũng đã đọc nó, hãy cho tôi biết suy nghĩ của bạn).
 ​
 Thùy thường ngỏ lời với một người yêu giấu tên mà cô tưởng như đã chia tay nhưng vẫn còn tình cảm. Cô ấy viết tắt anh ấy là &#x27;M&#x27;. Tôi đã tìm kiếm thông qua google bằng tiếng Anh nhưng không có thông tin.
 ​
 Tôi hỏi diễn đàn này vì tôi nghe nói cuốn sách có lượng người theo dõi lớn hơn nhiều ở Việt Nam. Có ai biết thêm về &#x27;M&#x27; không? Nếu bạn có thêm tài nguyên về cuộc sống của những người được miêu tả trong cuốn sách, vui lòng chia sẻ &#x3D;)

                              <span>My boyfriend’ll come back 🇻🇳 in November to visit his family after 4 years in Germany.
 He agreed to let me travel with him (I begged him 100 times 😅).
 He informed his family about me. His dad, big brother, sister in law and younger sister were very excited, and his mum seemed neutral.
 We would spend 5 days in Hanoi with his family and visit Danang before coming back 🇩🇪.
 His parents said I could stay in their house. They have a big house, so there are private spaces for me and boyfriend.
 I feel excited and concerned at the same time. Is it too “friendly” if I stay in their house? Or staying in hotel is safer option 
 What should I do to maintain good relationship with them as a westerner? If I stay with them, I can join their daily activities (cooking,…) and that’ll be fun 😁
 I prepared some gifts for his little sister. She’s so sweet.

                              <span>I noticed that the prices to add extra luggage are different on web browser (22 USD) and the app (13.66 USD). And the cheaper app one won’t let me purchase it for some reason. Are we able to purchase extra luggage at the airport a few days before? I feel like my luggage (20kg) that I purchased will be heavier once I leave the country.

                              <span>Besides the government structure, what is socialist about Vietnam. It seems to me like people here operate on the most extreme capitalist mindset even more so than capitalist countries. There are more social safety nets, social goods, social ideologies in Europe, Australia, or USA, than there are here. Just as a quick dumb example: there are way more parks and public areas in any of those countries than here. And the few ones that there are here always end up overrun with people trying to sell crap. In &quot;capitalist countries&quot; more people tend to agree collectively to leave public places for the public. They (usually) tend agree to pay taxes to fund all sorts of social services. It seems to me that in Vietnam everyone is always chasing the most minor personal gain even at the cost of social advancements for all. What is social about Vietnam?

 Can it be shipped here in PH? I&#x27;ve been craving them ever since.

                              <span>I am a Vietnamese-American who traveled to Vietnam to see my family and I happened to meet a girl at a spa on my last day in Vietnam. (It was at a highly rated spa with legit services)
 I thought she was attractive so I started up a conversation to get to know her and she said she didn’t have a boyfriend. I got her instagram and we started to talk for a month. She was very enthusiastic (never one word answers) and flirty with all her responses except I always had to start all the conversations. I recently told her I was really interested in her but that it would be difficult for us to maintain a relationship being so far away from each other and she said she was interested too and that if we “really loved” then it would work. 
 However, I went through her instagram followers and found her boyfriend that she has been dating for like 9 months. She doesn’t have any photos of him on her instagram but the boyfriend has all the photos of her on his profile. 
 After finding out, I didn’t confront her about it and immediately stopped messaging her and she hasn’t messaged me either but that wasn’t surprising to me because I was always the one to start the conversations. I guess I can understand why now because she has a boyfriend… Even though, we haven’t talked for a week, she still shows interest by liking my instagram stories.
 My question is why would she deceive me like this and waste all of my time? Was she ever actually interested in me?
 Part of me just wants to screenshot all the messages and send it to the boyfriend

                              <span>I live away from my family for just 10 years. However, the relationship between me and my parents was never good. I am close with my sister and my niece but the last time I saw them was 7 years ago. To be fair, we are all different people now. Although we text, call, talking in person is still another thing. 
 I left the country for education, for work but I also wanted to stay away from my family. Just typical Asian parents problems. Since moving away from them, our relationship got somewhat better, just because I don’t have to deal with bullshit anymore.
 I tried to put a smile on my face, I told my self that they will just stay for 1 month, I will be okay. But just 30 mins and I already felt depressed. It started with they filming me the second they saw me at the airport, shared it on Facebook and Tiktok, then with them trying to “help” me. Then they took off their shoes and put their feet on another seat when we were on public transport. I understand their motives, I just couldn’t stand it. The things they talk about, I can’t join. The things they do, I am not comfortable to. The cultural difference between us is big enough to keep us apart.
 I am worried that this trip will push me and my family away even further. 27 more days to go, and I don’t know how I should approach it.

                              <span>Some cafe I see people served bạc xỉu with Milo, which has become my favorite sweet coffee drinks to make at home.
 I&#x27;ve try mixing with green tea powder once...taste terrible, but maybe because of the wrong portion.
 Coconut milk is also common in some drinks that I&#x27;ve order.
 It make me wonder what other combo is there that I&#x27;m not aware of.
 Nutella sound like a good idea in theory, but has anyone adventerous enough to test this yet? 😆

                              <span>Hi sorry for asking this again, but previous reddit threads on this topic are outdated and don&#x27;t seem to be relevant anymore.
 I&#x27;m coming to Vietnam in the third week of September and my dream for this trip is to do some deep water soloing. I&#x27;ve never done it so I&#x27;m in need of a guide. (I am an experienced boulderer, but not the greatest swimmer. I&#x27;m trying to get over my fear of jumping in the water from heights....)
 If anyone knows any current climbing or adventure companies that organize tours or day trips or even just some guy with a boat and a topo I&#x27;d be psyched to hear about it!

 I will be visiting your beautiful country from January to March next year
 I&#x27;d like to spend most of my time near the beach, but still have good infrastructure, so Da Nang and Nha Trang make sense to me
 Air quality and water quality (for swimming at the beaches) are important 
 Being able to walk or bike most places is also nice, though good public transportation helps too
 I&#x27;d also like to be able to make genuine connections with people (both locals and immigrants)
 What do you recommend?

                              <span>Hi, I am coming back to Vietnam for good soon from the states. I am wondering about the money in my bank account right now. Should I use Remitly to send the money back there (I&#x27;ve heard they have the option where you will be receiving dollar bills from the comfort of you home), and then I can go to &quot;tiệm vàng&quot; later to exchange them? Or should I paypal my brother&#x27;s bank account in Vietnam? Also, what is the best bank for me to open later when I&#x27;m back there? Thanks in advance for any comments.

                              <span>Hi, all! 
 I like music that&#x27;s considered on the alternative side, everything from pop punk to death metal. 
 Most of the Vietnamese people I&#x27;ve met like to listen to ballads, which I don&#x27;t mind but I would rarely put some on.
 My niece and nephew just showed me the 7uppercuts and I really liked their stuff. Currently Tron Tim is on a loop and it will be for a while. 
 Can you guys recommend me more alternative music? I&#x27;m currently in the mood for pop punk but feel free to send me heavier stuff.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Off the back of the post asking the opposite, curious what people love about it. I&#x27;ll start with the general night time environment, broad concept but I love the karaoke by the street, the lights, street noises, all of it, it&#x27;s so different to where I live (although I do prefer living rurally like I do) and it cheers me up just riding around HCMC on a bike at night.

                              <span>This is a bit of a two part question. To preface for context - I am a Vietnamese person that grew up in the US. My Vietnamese speaking abilities is very bare-bones and simple. As such, when I went back to Vietnam, it was quite easy to identify me as a Viet-Kieu the second I opened my mouth.
 Now this prompted some thought and curiosity within me. For the typical local Vietnamese person, is it possible to identify the country that the VK person is from based off of their speech pattern/accent?
 Furthermore, do foreigners from different countries have different accents when speaking Vietnamese? For example, in the US, there is a distinctive difference between Latinos speaking english, Asians speaking English, Europeans speaking English, etc. As well, within those groups, you have subtler differences too. Like the French accent is different than the UK English accent. Vietnamese people speaking English have a different sound to Japanese people speaking English. Does this phenomenon occur in Vietnamese too?

                              <span>My brothers and i were born in the UK and went back to vietnam recently for the first time. it was a great experience but i noticed that even though we grew up speaking viet (it was my and my older brothers first language and my brother started speaking it right after learning english) almost everyone seemed to catch our « foreigner » (they called us viet kieu) accents pretty early on. in your opinion do most viet kieus usually have a strong accent ? if you are a local in VN what do viet kieu accents typically sound like to you and is it easy to know if they’re foreign born even if they’re fluent? Any tips on accent reduction at least while in vietnam? what are some sounds or words that distinguish the different accents/dialects ?

                              <span>Im studying abroad in france and there’s a dish called “bobun” here, it’s very popular and is often the first thing people point to when vietnamese cuisine is brought up. However i started to wonder if it’s actually vietnamese or more “viet inspired.” It’s a relatively simple vermicelli salad with toppings like beef, egg rolls, veggies. Is it “authentic”? 
 Both of my parents are from vietnam but i was born in america, so i wouldn’t say i was an expert on viet cuisine but i wondered if this is more of a fusion dish like orange chicken. My parents said they don’t know any dishes called just “bò bún” but that “bún thịt nướng” exists in VN for example. Does “bò bún” or anything like that exist in vietnam/vietnamese cuisine? if so what would be the closest to this dish?

                              <span>Anytime anyone says anything slightly critical of this country, the entire community will either be up in arms telling the foreigners to leave or insult them. Case in point the earlier ‘satire’ post, and many comments defending rude behaviours. 
 I don’t normally post or comment much, but the more I check out this subreddit the more I realise how terrible the mentality of the people in Vietnam is. 
 As A Viet diaspora, I really wanted to be proud of my heritage and culture, but it is just so hard. I am sure many second generation overseas Viets have this feeling as well. 
 Every time I see Vietnamese people from Vietnam while traveling overseas, the majority of them are extremely loud, oblivious to the people around them, and have terrible manners/ behaviours (eating with mouth open food flying everywhere like tf?). It is just so embarrassing every single time.
 Yes, Some polite behaviours are relative, however there is still a core set of behaviours that is consistent everywhere, such as, do not block the path, do not spit on the streets etc. One can’t just hide behind the concept of relativeness and ignore reality altogether. 
 I am both sad and angry because I know the Vietnamese are capable, but they just refuse to change or listen to criticism.
 Edit: Future readers can observe the comments and judge for yourself.

                              <span>Hi, I have been to Vietnam several times and now seriously thinking of going back there again.
 When I was thinking about my itineraries, I wanted to find out some website where I can find some day-trip or additional tour etc, like Viator or Klook. Could anyone tell me how Vietnamese people find/book such activities for their own trip?
 Thanks in advance for your help and knowledge sharing!!

 Does anyone know of a Vietnamese based proxy service that can buy items from Japan (just store, don&#x27;t need auction) and know how to navigate the shipping of the item into Vietnam?

                              <span>Greetings,
 I recently had the experience of getting to spend 3 weeks in Da Nang for business.
 I absolutely fell in love with Vietnam and have more than a passing curiosity to pursue a life there when I have completed my current employment contract.
 The thing is, I didn’t run into a single expat who wasn’t someone from NZ/AUS and on holiday money/trust fund living. They weren’t actually working, just long term hanging out.
 So for my expats who DO make a living contributing to Vietnam’s prosperity, what are some of the usual occupations expats do?
 My most current occupational background is in aviation maintenance , but I also have a masters in International Relations, and over 20 years of kitchen/food prep/food service. 
 I saw that there’s no “pensioner visa”, which would be nice because I’m expecting a pension of around $3000/month in about 5-8 years, but I don’t mind working past my first retirement.

 Hows the quality? And do you know anyone who has done it?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m moving to Vietnam soon and I would like to hear from people familiar with Bien Hoa City.
 What is it like? What are the things you enjoy or love about Bien Hoa? How does it compare to other places? Do people frequently travel to HCMC for quick trips? What are some nice sights to see or things to do in the area? Nightlife?
 Would love to hear some positive things, as I had my heart set on HCMC but I think Bien Hoa looks just as amazing and I think it would be a stepping stone into the country.

 As he juggled more than twelve Reddit tabs, bouncing between threads on r/Vietnam and leaving his objectively correct takes on topics such as “Why is Vietnam so goddamn filthy?” and “Why do the local barbarians chew with their mouths open?” McDooglestein told reporters that as a seasoned traveler from a very wealthy first world nation, he’s “never been so appalled by an utter lack of manners” as he has been during his time in Vietnam.

                              <span>Theo Tòa án tối cao Hoa Kỳ, trước khi thẩm vấn, cảnh sát phải thông báo cho nghi phạm hình sự như sau:
 &quot;Anh có quyền giữ im lặng và từ chối trả lời câu hỏi. Bất cứ điều gì anh nói cũng sẽ được dùng để chống lại anh trước tòa. Anh có quyền có luật sư trước khi khai báo với cảnh sát và luật sư sẽ hiện diện khi cảnh sát thẩm vấn anh. Nếu anh không thể tìm được luật sư, anh sẽ được cung cấp một luật sư trước khi trả lời các câu hỏi. Anh có thể trả lời câu hỏi khi không có luật sư, nhưng anh vẫn có quyền ngưng trả lời bất cứ lúc nào để chờ sự có mặt của luật sư&quot;.
 Điều này có nghĩa là không ai được phép cưỡng ép nghi phạm trả lời bất kỳ một câu hỏi nào khi không có mặt luật sư và trước khi ra toà thì nghi phạm cứ giữ im lặng thoải mái.
 Các quyền này là cơ bản trong nhân quyền và được áp dụng ở tất cả các quốc gia dân chủ. Theo tao nghiên cứu thì luật tố tụng hình sự Việt Nam không có điều nào thể hiện rõ những quyền này cả. Vậy nên bức cung, ép cung nó mới phổ biến và gây ra nhiều vụ án oan sai.

 I&#x27;m curious if it really is the most widely spoken, or it just happens to be the one that&#x27;s internationally recognized?

                              <span>My partner and I have limited time in Hanoi and would love to explore the Ha Giang Loop before leaving the northern part of VN. 
 What is the fastest time possible to safely complete the Ha Giang Loop or at least touch some base?
 Thanks in advance! 😌

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;ll be coming to Vietnam for work, and as a first-timer in the country, I want to make sure I&#x27;m well-prepared for my arrival, and I&#x27;m looking forward to your insights on what to expect and how to handle the arrival process smoothly.
 If you&#x27;ve been to Hanoi Airport before or have experience with arriving in Vietnam, I&#x27;d love to hear from you! What are the steps you recommend taking upon arrival at Hanoi Airport? Any tips for immigration, baggage claim, customs, currency exchange, transportation, and getting settled into accommodation would be greatly appreciated.
 Additionally, if you have any advice on local customs, cultural norms, or must-try experiences in Hanoi, I&#x27;m all ears. I believe that learning from others&#x27; experiences can truly enrich my journey.

                              <span>Perhaps các bạn can help me with this question. We have family that is currently working abroad over in South Korea and would like to wire transfer funds back to Vietnam to their family. Is there currently a service that allows them to accomplish this? I&#x27;ve looked into Wise, Remitly, Sendwave and a few others but did not currently see SK as a outbound remmitance, but only inbound for receiving. Thanks in advance!

 What are some of the brands you would recommend for quality Vietnamese ground coffee (Robusta)? If so, where to get them? Appreciate the help!

 I read something somewhere that Vietnam is really culturally opposed to extreme metal. Why is this so?

Pizza 4P&#x27;s is not really my style. Basta Hiro is better and cool but again not American style. I&#x27;m thinking to try Red and Round Restaurant soon. Anyone know of a good American or New York style Pizza joint around here?

                              <span>Tôi năm nay 20 tuổi muốn làm post này để nói kinh nghiệm đối đầu với toxic trên mạng .Tôi lúc nào chơi game Cs go gặp mấy đồng bào Việt Nam thì 80% là toxic cuối trận lúc nào cũng mắng khôn , cào phím . Trong lòng của tôi cũng rất là bực khi chơi game gặp phải mấy ông nội này nhưng mà tôi cũng nhận ra mình chỉ chơi game , chơi cho vui có gì đâu mà phải làm khó cho bản thân mình mà bực bội .Toxic có đầy ban cũng đâu hết được , quan trọng nhất là bản thân mình . Cứ chơi cho vui thôi , đừng để tâm mấy chuyện đó , cuối cùng nó cũng chỉ làm khó cho bản thân mình . Đôi khi người ta lỡ lời họ nói vậy hay họ thích gì họ nói đó . Đây là kinh nghiệm trong đời sống đừng để lòng mấy chuyện bực tức , cuối cùng mình là người gánh bệnh tật .

                              <span>Hi everyone! I’ll be visiting Vietnam during Christmas and I’d love to learn some Vietnamese to be able to speak to my partners family. 
 I use Duolingo right now, however I feel like they don’t explain the language very well and I need my partner to explain everything to me. 
 Does anyone know an app/book to help me learn basic conversations? 
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>Is the lunch lady in Saigon worth it? I’ve seen mixed reviews… people saying it was good, other people saying it was okay, other people saying they got scammed… I can’t make up my mind as I only have a few days there. I want to make sure I’m eating the best of the best.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a foreigner living in Vietnam and I follow some &quot;meme&quot; pages on Facebook about ASEAN nations (such as Indonesia, Cambodia, etc) I always see a lot of teasing (and sometimes infighting) in the comments about certain topics such as how Cambodia can&#x27;t let go of the past (when it comes to their territory) and how Indonesia is bad at football but always &quot;talks big&quot;. 
 So to the Vietnamese users of this sub, how do you feel about each of the SEA countries? Aside from Vietnam (of course), which one is your favorite? (Probabaly gonna see a lot of &quot;anh em Lào&quot; comments here haha)

                              <span>My pick has to be food diversity and how creative we are with taking what our surrounding countries has to offer develop our own version that fits the palettes of the locals. If you look at many popular dishes we have today, many can be linked to France, Thailand, China, Philliphines, etc. One of our popular dish is literally called Che Thai for crying out loud.

                              <span>Đang ngủ thì bị con này cắn, mình có tra thông tin và chỉ biết tên của nó là &quot;ectomocoris elegans&quot; và thuộc họ Bọ xít. Mọi người có thêm thông tin về nó cho mình biết nhé. Chứ giờ không thể ngủ lại vì nhức 🥲 
 Cảm giác khi bị cắn: nhức (như bị ong đốt). Sau đó có là cảm giác nhức nhối lan dần ở đầu ngón trỏ (vì mình cắn ở đầu ngón tay) nhưng mình đã chặn cơn đau này bằng cách siết ngón trỏ lại. Sau đó rửa bằng xà phòng cà dùng povidine 10%. Hiện tại, ngón tay của mình cảm thấy hơi nhức (không quá nhức như ban đầu), căng cứng và tê ở đốt ngón tay đầu tiên.
 I was sleeping when I was bitten by this one, I looked up the information and only knew its name is &quot;ectomocoris elegans&quot; and belongs to the family of Hemeptera. If anyone has more information about it, please let me know. But now I can&#x27;t go back to sleep because of the pain 🥲. Sensation when bitten: pain (like being stung by a bee). After that, there was a burning pain in the tip of my index finger (because I bit the tip of my finger) but I stopped this pain by squeezing my index finger. Then wash with soap and use povidine 10%. Currently, my fingers feel a little sore (not too sore like the original), tight and numb in the first knuckle.

                              <span>Hi.
 A friend of mine living in France wants to marry his vietnamese girlfriend so he can have a longer visa, or she can leave the country to have a better salary (the ideal solution). He recently found out that his gf&#x27;s mom faked her birth year so she could legally work at 14. 10 years later, now that her mom isn&#x27;t responsible of her child fake birth certificate anymore (is it true?), she told the authorities about that. Therefore they believe mariage isn&#x27;t possible anymore and both fear the government repression.
 Is there any solution to that ? It&#x27;s difficult to find any informations about vietnamese government and law on the internet by not speaking or writing vietnamese well.
 Also, I personally fear that this could be a gigantic scam. Is it some deja vu story ?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello!
 My girlfriend (who is viet) and I are going to Vietnam in October. We&#x27;ve tentatively decided Oct 9th - 23rd or around there. Now I&#x27;ve been to Asia before and was in Hong Kong in april myself to visit my family along with my gf.
 I am wondering if I should be taking any preparations food wise , as I am aware that the food hygiene is not that great. I also don&#x27;t want a repeat of what I experienced as a kid in HK 20 years ago (diarrhea and the shits and vomiting) lol. In my experience, it was herbs and ice water that gave me problems, but I was wondering if I should be more careful?
 Second question is -Im bringing a camera along with me for travels, but its quite an expensive camera. My girlfriend was discussing this with me and told me to be carefeul about it being snatched. Therefore I am wondering i should take extra precautions with getting a security strap thats securely anchored so that no body can just snatch it away from me. Is theft an issue?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Ive been in vietnam for 5 months, there is this custom that makes me feel very irritated. My friend( a vietnamese) whenever he has a friend that comes over to meet him, although the guy is sitting at the front, clear as day, his friend on a bike park right outside the street, spamming the honk like a madman, not even bothering take it inside and call my friend, what is that ? This is frustrating and i am thinking of finding a place to live elsewhere that is more civilized. Is this honking culture everywhere ? Or its just in the countryside ?

                              <span>Initially, I thought many of these women were taking bridal photos or that they were models. But then I just noticed local women almost every 10-15 min in nice dresses having their photos taken in all sorts of settings. Alleys, bridges, in front of abandoned buildings and steel gates. 
 And many will have 1-3 men with large lenses taking their photos. 
 Is this a typical tradition in HCMC / Saigon? Photos for online dating? Wedding photos? Social media flex?
 Visiting HCMC / Saigon for the first time. Haven’t seen anything similar in other SEA cities.

                              <span>Currently traveling around Vietnam for the first time and loving it. I work in construction in Australia and so some things stand out to me. I have noticed that many things are done to a certain level and then finished poorly. We went to My Son today and I overheard a tour guide telling his group that the Cham would complete tasks perfectly to 80% and then poorly the other 20%. So is that still a thing here?

                              <span>I am travelling in Vietnam and I seem to have contracted food poisoning from somewhere. Of course I never think that something like this will happen until it does! I am wondering what does the sub think the level of hygiene is at in Vietnam in terms of food preparation? Also what are some of the places or foods I should avoid or signs to look out for to avoid this happening again?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a college student in Hanoi who is a thrift enthusiast and want to practice my English speaking skills.
 So I will volunteer to guide anyone who like thrifting to explore the real thrift markets in Ha Noi. I will help you bargain good price, find the place to shop for cool stuff, give you some tips to explore Hanoi, and maybe eat some street food while we go.
 Places im planning to go:
 - Đông Tác Market (all kind of second-hand stuff)
 - Đặng Văn Ngữ Market (cheaper than Đông Tác and has mostly women clothes)
 - Hoàng Tích Trí Street (leather goods)
 All of these places are in Đống Đa District
 Available time: 1 PM - 6:30 PM, every weekend
 Just sent me a message, I will create a group and then we will go together.

 Can you relate?
 “If I go back to Vietnam, could I go with this person? And you realize no. They would not make a good travel companion, they would not get it. And if they do not get Vietnam I don’t know whether I can be friends with them anymore. That’s a terrible thing to admit. Your perspective have shiftet. You cannot look at your old life the same way. When you know things could be different.”

                              <span>My mother is looking to move in September but am having trouble finding an airline that will allow to bring our family shih tzu along. He is a service dog and should be allowed in cabin. I have found a few that would allow him to travel to certain countries but is restricted when when it comes to flying into Vietnam. 
 Anyone able to successfully travel with a similar snub nosed dog with them? If so which airlines did you use?

 Can I have a Grab take me to Sun World. I have fun there. And then can I walk to the Ga cáp treo Suối Mơ - Bà Nà Cable Car Station? And from there I will take the cable cars up to Ba Na Hills? And to return, I would take the cable cars back down, and have a Grab pick me up from around Sun World.
 Also, does anyone have any idea how long the cable car ride takes?

                              <span>27 year old Female here. I am planning to travel to Vietnam in November along with my friend. We have not yet decided the dates. Is there any special time in November when events are occuring? For eg: events where we can witness fireworks?
 Also, in general, travel tips would really really help us! What places should we cover and what are absolute gems? Is safety a concern we should have? I am from India bdw. We are planning to book a return flight from a different city than the city we will be landing in since we wish to cover many places. Also, we will be in Vietnam for around 10 days. 
 I also wanted to confirm if USD is accepted everywhere. We will also be carrying Forex cards. 
 I really apologize for so many questions. This will be my first international trip. Really excited to visit your beautiful country and amazing people!!!
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I have a multi drug resistant bacterial infection that has failed all treatment options in Thailand. There is an antibiotic sold in Vietnam that i can use as a 3rd line treatment. 
 I am wondering i anyone who is traveling to Bangkok can buy it and take it with them. I will pay for the medications and give extra money. I am just very desperate at this point. I have suffered with this for months and I am afraid. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I notice that so many foreigners who are allergic to different kinds of foods traveling to Vietnam. But I barely see Vietnamese who have food allergies. Even if they have it, it is just very light symptoms like a little itchy or their skin turning red, not deadly like most foreigners. 
 Is there any explanation for that? why are a lot of foreigners allergic to foods versus a very small number of Vietnamese people?

                              <span>To be fair, only 1984 and Animal farm are currently banned (Homage to catalonia is in circulation) and you can still buy the english version of those books online or get the bootleg 2013 Vietnamese version that was discontinued by Nha Nam for $5-10.
 Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead is published by Tre Publishing (owned by Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union btw). AFAIK, it’s very popular among younger readers. 
 Fun fact: Ayn Rand was extremely vocal against the Vietnam War believing Communism would have collapsed without intervention (lol?) while the voice of America, John Steinbeck, publicly supported the war (in private, it was more complex than that). He also famously hated ideological orthodoxy i.e even calling champagne socialists “temporarily embarrassed capitalists” (sound familiar?). This might be why it took until 2021 for Steinbeck magnum opus “East of Eden” to be released in Vietnam.

                              <span>Xin chào mội người. Em đang là sinh viên mới hết năm nhất ở NEU. Bây giờ em đang hoang mang quá không biết làm gì để cái tương lai nó sáng. Background em học chuyên khá lớn, IELTS 7.5, em xét tuyển sớm và đỗ nên cũng không quan trọng điểm thi THPT nhưng thi không ôn gì cũng đc 27 điểm. Flex tí nhưng, ai cũng sẽ tưởng một đứa thế này thì lo quái gì. Em thành thật em khá lo về cái long run cho sự nghiệp. Em đang học tài chính vì nó hay và rộng nhưng em thật sự chưa biết cái gì phù hợp. Cái chính là ở đại học em chưa biết nên chú trọng cái gì ạ, em có thử tham gia các CLB nhưng failed. Em cũng muốn đi thi case nhưng chưa đủ kiến thức. Em còn định thưc tập nhưng chưa có công ty tuyển. Địng hướng của em đang định vào big3 consulting hay big4, em cũng khá muốn làm về data hay business analyst. Nhưng em lại thấy khá nản và yêu cầu rất cao kiểu em not good enough. Hiện tại em thực sự mê consulting và em cần một số lời khuyên để nổi bật ạ. Em thấy bản thân đang khá phai mờ, tại vì có quá nhiều cơ hội trên đại học và em không biết nên đầu tư vào đâu. Em thấy mình khá vô dụng, đại học nhiều người giỏi lắm nhưng em không biết học đến đó bằng cách nào huhu. Em không muốn 4 năm tuổi thơ mình chỉ có học, xong chơi, làm mấy công việc kiếm tiền qua ngày rồi bị đá ra ngoài xã hội loay hoay nhìn bạn bè phát triển.

                              <span>Hello All,
 I have posted here a year or so ago about the difficulties of getting my daughter her birth certificate here. My wife is Vietnamese, I am American, and we live in Vietnam which is where my daughter was born. The birth certificate issue was due to us giving her a western name and no one here telling us you cannot do that and instead just rejecting the birth certificate. So we got that resolved and gave our daughter a Vietnamese name and now have her birth certificate so the next step is getting a passport so I can take them to meet my family in America.
 It has been atleast 6 months and no passport. The reason being is when we renamed my daughter we gave her my family name which is a single syllable 3 letter name. Previously it was my father in law&#x27;s name who is divorced from my…</span>

                              <span>I just downloaded the app and registered. Then I realized that my number is registered to a different person. How did this happen? I bought this sim around January 2022. It was brand new. I still have the sim case (the card that the sim was attached to) I hid my number below the name. But the numbers that I circled, are those a phone number?

                              <span>im a viet canadian and growing up my parents always spoke about chinese people using “they” and talked about them like they were super foreign and distanced from us. i get it because even though we have some cultural similarities like lunar new year we are still very different. however recently i found out that both of my parents each have a chinese grandparent who moved from south china to vietnam and assimilated long ago. there are no traces of chinese heritage within my family, no one has preserved the culture and language, it’s as if we are 0% chinese rather than 25% chinese. but honestly had i not inquired i never would have known. is this unusual for viets who are able to trace a chinese ancestor? do you consider yourselves viet-chinese or just viet? for my family i have always wondered why we don’t acknowledge it or consider ourselves chinese when there is a significant part of our heritage that is from china, but culturally we are 100% viet, the only chinese culture my parents have is going to eat dim sum lol. so i don’t really know if i can consider myself partially chinese when it was essentially erased. is it a common experience for any other viet people either in the diaspora or living in VN itself? if you had any chinese ancestors has your family retained any aspect of their culture now?

                              <span>I will be in Danang for work in October. 
 I was hoping to get a sports coat made. I have never had one made, so I dont really know the process. I was hoping for some recommendations of places to go. 
 I also need to find some souvenir shops. I dont want any food or purses or clothes. I am looking for statues ideally. So far, I have:
 (Stone Sculpture Store - 2747+VGJ, Hoà Hải, Ngũ Hành Sơn, Đà Nẵng 550000, Vietnam)
 (Non Nuoc Stone Carving - 160 Nguyễn Duy Trinh, Hoà Hải, Ngũ Hành Sơn, Đà Nẵng 550000, Vietnam)

                              <span>Im as a vietnamese going on youtube noticed a new trend recently where many channel start analysing(not actually but more like recap criminal cases). Those channel starting out kinda normal but then it getting weird in someway. Not be judging bc Im also watched these video a lots but like some fans start saying like this is just a scare story for midnight. Some people listen to this when work and sleep💀. In conclusion, is this a okay thing? Or it gonna creating some problem in future….

I would like to ask for your participation in my survey if you are an expat and want to/already open a business in Vietnam! The survey is only about 3-5min and every information is for research purpose only so please tell me if you are willing to help. 
 If you are not interested in survey but have anything to share about motivations behind expat&#x27;s business operation in Vietnam, give me a sign and I truly hope we could have a small conversation (not a lengthy interview 👎 ) about your story! Every single response is gonna help me a lot so I appreciate your effort and if you know anyone suitable please introduce to me.

                              <span>Hãy nhìn bản đồ đường UNCLOS 200 hải lý đăng trên BBC.
 Bản đồ đường UNCLOS 200 hải lý
 Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei,... đang đòi chia theo đường UNCLOS 200 hải lý. Nếu tòa quốc tế phán quyết đảo không phải của Trung Quốc nhưng của Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei,... thế thì khác nào từ mất đảo cho Trung Quốc đổi sang mất đảo cho 3 nước đó, chúng ta đâu có được cái gì?
 Hơn nữa, bây giờ thì Trung Quốc vẫn đang là bên vi phạm luật, Việt Nam vẫn còn mang tư cách nạn nhân bị lấn chiếm. Nếu đem ra kiện thì ngay lập tức 2 quần đảo sẽ không còn là của Việt Nam nữa, khi đó các hành động sử dụng khai thác 2 quần đảo của Việt Nam sẽ bị coi là lấn chiếm lãnh thổ của Brunei/Malaysia/Phillippines. Hiện tại 2 quần đảo hãy còn là vùng đang tranh chấp, chúng ta vẫn đang có 50 tiền đồn trên quần đảo Trường Sa, chẳng lẽ đi kiện để rồi mất trắng?
 Cho nên là đừng nghĩ quốc tế đang ủng hộ chúng ta. Trong cuộc chơi giữa các ông lớn với nhau thì chủ quyền của một nước nhỏ như Việt Nam chúng ta không là cái gì cả. Rất đau lòng nhưng cần phải chấp nhận sự thật như thế, chứ nếu ảo tưởng Hoàng Sa-Trường Sa vẫn đang thuộc về Việt Nam thì sẽ vĩnh viễn đứng nhìn cảnh kẻ khác làm giàu trên máu thịt của mình mà thôi.

                              <span>I was in my car parked stationary in a proper boxed spot, and got rammed into from behind by a motorcyclist. I even got the whole thing recorded on my rear camera. But dude was raving about not having to pay anything as in Vietnamese culture, the car is always at fault regardless of how the accident happened.
 The motorcyclist is also demanding cash via text now in compensation to fix his motorcycle, phone, and laptop (I exchanged phone numbers with him for my insurance claims). Damage is minor and i don&#x27;t plan on paying him a single cent. Just curious if this mentality is common.
 A Vietnamese friend of mine told me that its often true simply because car drivers are perceived to be more financially capable to bear the costs, even if they&#x27;re not at fault. If this is true, that&#x27;s pretty messed up. 
 Update: Motorcyclist is still trying to text and call me for cash. I suggested we settle this in the police station with my rear cam recording at hand. But he rejected. I&#x27;m starting to believe that this dude probably doesn&#x27;t even have a license.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m a second-gen Viet American, which of course comes with its own set of deep cognitive dissonance. 
 I&#x27;m quite proud of my culture and celebrate it openly, and I&#x27;m also very lucky to have grown up in an area with strong Viet communities. As I went into high school, as a reaction to dismal education on the history of the Vietnam war, I did a lot of reading on my own and was pretty surprised by how different it was to my parent&#x27;s accounts. 
 Of course I understood my parents went through unimaginable hardships during the war, I absolutely don&#x27;t dismiss their personal experiences. I think it&#x27;s common for Viet-American kids to be raised being told that HoChiMinh is an evil, genocidal man and that the communist party is the worst thing ever. I adopted it as part of the culture of the dias…</span>

                              <span>I’ll be traveling to Vietnam in two weeks. I’ll be in Saigon, Da Nang/Hoi An, and Hanoi (and the surrounding area perhaps). I am not on a backpacker budget but I figure for most of the trip there is still no reason to spend anymore than like 1,000,000 VND (30-40 USD) a night because the rooms are nice enough at that price. 
 But, this trip is somewhat of a celebration (just finished law school and took the bar) so at least once in the trip I would like to splurge, by Vietnamese standards, and get a really nice room. I guess like 3,500,000 VD (150 USD) a night. 
 I was thinking this would be best done in Da Nang because it’s on the beach and it’ll will be a pretty relaxing part of my trip. It didn’t seem necessary to spend too much in Saigon because I’ll be out and about all day and basically just sleeping at the hotel. 
 So, does this line of thinkingmake sense, and if so, can anyone recommend some more upscale places that you’ve had good experiences at? Would like a nice pool and bar area, good food, service, etc… 
 Open to this stuff in Saigon and Hanoi as well just like I said, doesn’t seem as worth it as Da Nang but open to being proved wrong. Thanks!

I could just drink that like soup, and I did.. haha I&#x27;m looking for a recipe for hanoi style bun cha sauce, I&#x27;ve seen so many recipes and I feel like most of them focus mostly on the meat preparation but I&#x27;m obsessed with the sauce I would love you input, maybe some family recipes?!

                              <span>I&#x27;m traveling to Ho Chi Minh for the 2nd time in October and I&#x27;m super excited. I didnt have the best experience the last time I went but im looking forward to traveling here again. I adore Vietnamese food (im SE asian too) and i wanted to ask if locals have any suggestions for restaurants and Vietnamese food I should try (aside from the usual pho and banh mi). Appreciate any suggestions 😊

                              <span>I am travelling to Vietnam with a friend as an adult for the first time, and I need all the advises I could get. I know that we need to get an evisa to enter the country, but if we are heading out in mid-October, when should I apply for the visa? Also, can I use the same visa to leave back to USA? We will be there in October, so what will the weather be like? What would you guys recommend to pack, buy/bring? What are some places you guys recommend for us to visit? We are open to everything, but super excited to do some shopping (clothes/skincare/makeup,) food places, entertainments, and spa/massage etc. We&#x27;ll be staying in Saigon around Binh Thanh if it helps! Also, if there is any apps that would be useful for my travel, I would greatly appreciate it. FINALLY, please let me know what to avoid, and what are some well-known scams to look out to. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I’ll be going to Vietnam for the month of September with my boyfriend. This is not a hiking vacation, but we will do some touristy things I’m sure. He’s viet and I’m American, but he moved when he was a child and I can’t figure out what to wear and he’s not much help. Some people tell me just normal clothes, some tell me very modest attire. I know it’s hot and humid, so no way I’ll wear any jeans. Are tennis skirts ok? Should all dresses and skirts be ankle length? Is it offensive to see shoulders? I don’t want to offend anyone, but I also want to be comfortable.

                              <span>Currently there&#x27;s been a lot of Vietnam bashing on behavior but it&#x27;s really unfair. Most middle class Vietnamese people don&#x27;t have the behaviors people come here to vent about. 
 I&#x27;m curious, is there a high society movement? Do people use the term &quot;high soc&quot; here?Are vietnamese trying to differentiate themselves as high society from low society? In Thailand all you hear is high soc low soc everywhere especially with the rich parents of the students.

                              <span>I’m Vietnamese but born in Australia. Apologies for my ignorance but I need some perspective. My family said Vietnam dislike China and I want to get perspective from those who are living in VN atm. I’ll be visiting Vietnam in September for the first time with my husband. He is Malaysian Chinese who is also born in Australia. He has an Australian passport but his surname is very chinese. Will he get targeted for bribes at the airport? $20 is not much for us but it’s the principle. My dad said that they don’t usually target younger people but I saw a few people here mentioning that they do. I can’t wait to visit my motherland but a bit nervous as I don’t know what to expect. Thank you

                              <span>chào mn, gần đây thì mn đã nghe nhiều về những drama xung quanh hoa hậu rồi nhỉ?
 mình thực sự không biết tác dụng của hoa hậu là gì.
 sắc đẹp là thứ từ khi được sinh ra đã nhận được, không cần qua rèn luyện thì có gì để thi thố và tự hào nhỉ. tự hào về thứ được ban cho ?, pttm tí cũng đẹp lên ngay ấy mà.
 nếu thi hoa hậu phải biết ứng xử thì thi mấy cuộc thi hùng biện cũng được mà nhỉ :v , thậm chí họ còn làm tốt hơn ấy chứ.

                              <span>I am going to Vietnam with my family soon and I was wondering how Grab works (both for rides &amp; food delivery) 
 Can I pay in cash or does it have to be only card? Does international credit card (VISA) work? Does it automatically convert from VND —&gt; USD when charged?
 I already let the bank know I am going to be in Vietnam. 
 Appreciate any advice, thank you!!!

                              <span>Thứ nhất: Mấy người vi phạm giao thông thì đã là người sai rồi. Mỗi năm có hàng triệu người chết vì tai nạn giao thông, mà đa phần là do những nguyên nhân hoàn toàn có thể phòng tránh được. Mấy người vi phạm thì tức là đang tăng rủi ro tai nạn lên cho bản thân và người khác, đến lúc tai nạn tàn phế ra thì ai cứu, chỉ còn biết than trời chứ làm thế nào được?
 Thứ hai: Csgt ăn đút lót thì chính mấy người vi phạm là người đút lót, csgt lỗi 10 thì mấy người cũng lỗi 7-8. Giả sử bạn vi phạm, bị vẫy lại, thay vì xin ghi biên bản, nộp bằng lái nộp phạt, thì lại chọn đút lót cho csgt hứa em không sai nữa, và rồi về chửi là csgt ăn hối lộ? Mà nếu các ông nghĩ mình không sai bị ăn tiền láo thì làm mẹ biên bản đi cho nó chuẩn chứ rén à mà hối lộ? Khó hiểu? Xong giả sử gặp ông csgt chuẩn, nhất quyết không nhận hối lộ thì lại lên mạng cào phím nhà nước phạt lắm tiền hút máu dân à?
 Tất nhiên tôi không cổ vũ cho hành động ăn hối lộ của csgt, hai cái sai thì không làm nên một cái đúng. Chỉ là nếu mọi người có ghét csgt thì hãy tìm lý do khác như kiểu gặp mấy thằng cảnh sát hách dịch, thái độ hà hiếp dân chẳng hạn, chứ tự người vi phạm đút lót để cho qua chuyện mà giờ lại chửi csgt ăn tiền thì nó vô lý.
 P/s: bình thường thì &quot;thằng cảnh sát&quot;, &quot;chó vàng&quot;, &quot;pikachu&quot; nhưng lúc ăn nhậu hay vặn quá tay ga bị vẫy thì chìa mấy trăm ra gọi &quot;anh cảnh sát&quot; ngọt xớt :)

                              <span>Hello! Will be traveling to Hanoi on the first week of September. I saw in my weather app that it’ll be rainy but I just wanted to know how bad the rain would be? Would it be raining the entire day? And would Ninh Binh still be enjoyable even though it’s raining? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi my friends, would love to travel maybe even live in vietnam for a while but I might have a disease called celiac. it’s basically when even small amounts of gluten make you severely sick it is causing inflammation in your body and much more.
 I used to love vietnamese food here in germany but from my knowledge most of the dishes contain gluten at least here.
 Are there many dishes without gluten? is gluten free easily accessible on the country side? 
 It’s actually so severe that I have to be careful going to restaurant because if someone prepares a meal with gluten ona table and then prepares a gluten free meal on it that might be enough for me to react and get glutened.
 advice will be appreciated &lt;3

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to preface my rant - I&#x27;m Vietnamese. Living in western culture my whole life. Travelled extensively all around the world. I got enough of a perspective.
 I don&#x27;t follow the sub closely, but lately I can&#x27;t help but notice the posts where the OP is really dumbfounded that a totally different Asian culture with a heavy history has it&#x27;s ways in day-to-day life and views?
 To me it looks like the certain disdain and irritation as in &quot;Why you guys aren&#x27;t like Bali, where the culture is all so westernized and easy for us to consume?&quot;
 It seems so natural for me that when facing a different culture and especially in a developing country I am very respectful and accepting of the way they are. Instead of being on a high moral ground and in a position of a consumer, I try to get to know the people, the culture and be thankful that I&#x27;m being welcomed to their home.
 UPD. Since people get confused about what I&#x27;m trying to say. There are things that are deeply rooted in the culture of a nation. That&#x27;s the &quot;otherness&quot; that people may or may not appreciate, but that&#x27;s unique to every culture.
 There are problems that arise from socio-economical background and are pretty common in Asia and all around the developing countries. Those are things no Vietnamese is proud of but we are on the track of dealing with them.

                              <span>Van den Brink said, &quot;We front-loaded our pricing. We ran into a pretty strong economic slowdown in the key market of Vietnam, which is disproportionately important to us.&quot;
 This is from the recent earnings report. Is Vietnam really experiencing an economic slowdown like this CEO said?

My 2nd cousin and I are the same age. I spend tonight like many nights before laying in the living room bed in the dark with multiple fans spinning and wondering how life could have been different. I wonder how life would have been like if the roles were reversed.
 17 years ago, I was 13-14 years old and visited Vietnam for the first time with my grandma and uncle and his wife. I spent a month in Vietnam and do not remember much but I do remember meeting the youngest great aunt and my 2nd cousin. I have happy and memorable memories with them. I remember meeting my great uncle who had a mental illness. He was locked in a jail bar room for his …</span>

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s a personal choice to eat how you want. And some foreigners also eat with the putrid sound of wet mushy food smacking back and forth while eating with their mouth open.
 But I find it to be much more common here in Vietnam. 
 To me, it&#x27;s one of those sounds that rattle my insides. Similar to someone rubbing a balloon or scraping on a chalk board. 
 I&#x27;m sitting at a coffee shop now and a couple just sat next to me and they are both mouth smacking their food for the past 10 minutes or so. Even putting my earbuds in and putting the volume high. I can still hear it
 I know others also find this sound irritating. And it&#x27;s obvious that people are able to eat without opening their mouths all the way 500 times during a meal and showing everyone the visuals and sounds of the first steps of the human digestion process
 I don&#x27;t say anything. I&#x27;m not being a Karen. But it&#x27;s absolutely disgusting. Why don&#x27;t friends say anything to these people? Or literally nobody cares and it&#x27;s enjoyable to eat a meal with these people as they make some of the most unappetizing noises? Why so common here in Vietnam? Like, the louder you eat your food, the richer you are? It brings you good luck or something? 
 Nasty noises from your mouth keep the ghosts away maybe? 👻

                              <span>Hi everyone! My partner and I have slowly started to look into potential baby names as we want to start a family soon. For reference, I am European Australian while my partner was born and raised in Vietnam. Any children we have will most likely grow up in Australia, though will frequently visit Vietnam to see family. We want to choose a first name that can easily be used in both Australia and Vietnam.
 We have been looking into Western first names that when shortened also sound like a Vietnamese name (this would be their nickname and also what they are called when in Vietnam). For example:
 (F) Maia (shortened to Mai) / (F) Maysie (shortened to May) / (M) Vincent (shortened to Vinh).
 Do you guys think this is too weird? 😅 Can you think of any other names like this?
 Otherwise, we were thinking of using a Vietnamese first name that is easy for English speakers to pronounce. Does anyone have any ideas?
 Opinions and advice would be great, thank you 😊
 Edit: We are mostly struggling with male names, though recommendations for female names would also be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Me and my girlfriend will be traveling to Vietnam from end of August till mid September (23 days).
 We came up with the following itinerary: 
  
Ho Chi Minh
 
Hoi An 
 
Lang Co Beach 
 
Hué 
 
Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park
 
Nih Binh - Trang An 
 
Hanoi 
 
Sa Pa / Fansipan or Ha Long Bay (depending how we feel)
 
 You think this is viable? Or did we plan too much? Your input is very much appreciated!

I miss the cheap food, my family, the vibes, technically everything you can think of. But that’s just life I guess, back to responsibilities and jobs. Genuinely can’t wait until I can go back 😂😭

                              <span>Probably we all know Vietnamese people get really uncomfortable with public displays of affection (kissing, hugging,…). I’m curious about how family members show love in their daily life. 
 I (30F) don’t remember the last time I gave my parents hugs or said “I love you” to them. I love them dearly, but it feels really awkward for me to say loving words or be affectionate toward them. 
 In our nuclear family, we give each other big hugs and say “I love you” every single day. My kids would get very upset if I forgot to do those things before rushing to work. 
 My parents at their 70s don’t sleep together anymore, and I never heard them say “I love you” to each other. I feel bad for them. I really wanna give my parents some support but there’s always an invisible wall between me and them that I find it so difficult to break. 
 I wonder if my situation is typical in Vietnamese culture or is it just my family background? My parents rarely say sweet words, always try to suppress their feelings and emotions (except for anger and frustrations 😑). They show their love by attentive care and share.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I’ll be traveling to Ho Chi Minh City in September with my boyfriend and his family from the United States. 
 My boyfriend grew up there until he was about 8 years old then he moved here. He has a self admittedly very limited knowledge of the culture, things to see, norms etc. but he and his sister keep giving me the idea that I’ll hate it there and be very uncomfortable; the food will be shocking, pickpocketers, massive pests, domestic abuse, and lots of personal judgment of me based on how I react but they aren’t able to give me much specific advice of how to behave
 I don’t want to go into this 2 week long trip with a negative attitude, so what are some things to look forward to on my trip? I know it’s a beautiful place with lots to see but I just don’t know where to begin with all of these warnings about how bad it is
 Additionally, what are some cultural norms I should know about to make sure I don’t offend anyone, get lost or put in a bad situation when I don’t know the language?

I stop momentarily to look at my shoe and assess the situation and this guy just starts trying to untie my shoelace!
 I swiftly moved on when he started doing this but I&#x27;m still quite confused about this interaction. I don&#x27;t see what objective the man had in mind by doing this as obviously any sensible person is just going to respond to this by walking (or running) away. Can anyone enlighten me as to what was going on here? Could there have been anything particularly offensive about my shoes that warranted this behaviour?

                              <span>Having lived in Vietnam and other parts of asia for quite a while, there is one topic which is quite difficult to understand ; real estate and its pricing.
 My general observations to date :
 - Generally, land is highly sought after for both investment, speculation and living. They&#x27;re seen as an appreciating asset. Prices are eyewateringly high in major urban centers by global standards. Value is not in the home on the land (often knocked down quickly), but rather in the land itself
 - Condominiums are depreciating assets ; as they age, new projects pop up, generally the price tends to go down over time. That said, there are those who hope to buy a project off-plan (eg. before it is built), and then resell it by the time it is competed hoping to make money (arguably also speculation)
 - Foreigners face restrictions (cannot own land without complicated workarounds), and for condominiums must buy from a specific pre-allocated set of units in certain projects, which stays below a threshold (I believe 49%). Then there&#x27;s the leasehold structure of 50 years which may impact the sale-ability
 Would love to get input on whether this is right, what I&#x27;ve missed and what more there is to this.I still have lots of questions, such as :
 - Are vietnamese subject to the leasehold structure?
 -How firm ones individual rights are in the case the Govt plans some project that impacts ones residence?
 - To what extent is there predictability to the prices or if its just a FOMO (fear of missing out) speculation frenzy?- If condominiums generally depreciate, then is it really a worthwhile financial investment?
 -How are land prices set? is it wild west or is there a government appraisal / pricing process? if so, how come land prices even in fairly rural places are higher per square meter than for example, London?

                              <span>I hate that shit when I was a kid. Literally the most toxic thing to discuss about. Made me and many other people feel like shit and awkward. I don’t know why this became the norm. It’s like they think that because we’re kid, we don’t have feelings and don’t feel sad when adult talk down on us and compared us to other people. I know that in Vietnamese culture, respecting adults is utmost important even when what they are doing is wrong, which is probably why it has been happening for so long. Just imagine asking them back “well why aren’t you as successful and better shape than Chu Ut? You had more time than me at being successful, why are you comparing me to other kids?” Definitely will get the stick for that haha.

                              <span>Yesterday there was a post about Born Pink’s concert stadium filled with trash after the concert had finished. There were alot of people who defended it using excuses such as: “Oh all concerts are like that everywhere.”, “they paid big buck for the tickets, they had the right to use the service.”,etc.
 Well, here’s a few examples of Vietnam’s beautiful natural landscapes ruined by trash because the people don’t give a shit about policing their trash.

                              <span>Some examples I picked up of the common vehicles:
 Honda PCX150 is 70 million in Vietnam and the PCX160cc ABS model is 47 million.
 Honda Jazz is 700 million in Vietnam and in Indonesia, it&#x27;s 416 million. That&#x27;s a difference of almost 300 million.
 Is there a big used vehicles market? Is it worth buying a used vehicle? If yes, what&#x27;s the best place to search it as Facebook marketplace isn&#x27;t commonly used here
 Are their brands that I should opt for instead of paying such a high premium that are perhaps taxed less in Vietnam like Vinfast or something similar?

                              <span>Heading to Hanoi this Fri (4th Aug) and we planned to head to Sapa for the next 2 nights (5th to 7th Aug).
 However looking at the weather forecasts (indications of heavy thunderstorms), I am wondering if it&#x27;s going to be worthwhile or are we better off staying in Hanoi and doing day trips to Ninh Binh etc. or even do Ha Long Bay. Besides the weather I am also concerned if the roads will be safe - we have booked a shared minibus (those that can seat 7 to 8) which will take 5hrs each way to/fro Sapa - any advice appreciated!

                              <span>Viet couple here. We went shooting in Pattaya. To be honest, shooting in Cu Chi Tunnels was much more fun, you got to shoot stuffs from WW2 even, and free to use your phone to record. In Thailand you can&#x27;t take any photo or video, and they charged 300 baht (210k VND) for 5 photoes and vids.

 A depiction of me dying a little inside wkwkwk
 TL;DR: Surely it must be possible to have short simple Vietnamese sentences that don&#x27;t sound and look all the same to a beginner?
 Hi, so, I started learning Vietnamese via Duolingo recently... DL is really not known for teaching you words in a logical order and often giving you weird starter examples but VN version is next-level to me. Sometimes it teaches certain really random words. Like starting with things like ong (bee) for Vietnamese. Mhh OK... Anyway, Indonesian is similar but it&#x27;s still great for daily vocabulary practice :)
 But I wonder... Is this what I will have to learn to read for real? I seriously feel like Duolingo curriculum creators are fucking with you in the first few lessons. Like why would you pick the name of the main antagonist to be An, and then you have your first sentences to be stuff like An ăn anh ấy. I&#x27;m making this example up because I forgot the exact ones, but the early samples have something like this where it&#x27;s just non-stop an&#x27;s and as a beginner you&#x27;re just like.... Mother of God LOL cmon bro.
 I feel like they legit put the most unfavorable sentences at the start to make you question if you want to learn the language O_o. I know that due to tones you can easily have many words that look the same but... It seems so unrealistic to me to have simple sentences in literally the beginner section and then teach something like &quot;Con cá cắn cái ca&quot;... I feel like they do this on purpose LMAO... Am I just imagining things or should I just get used to being massively confused at the start of learning Vietnamese :D?

                              <span>Context, I am Vietnamese but have spoken english for most of my adult life. So, I have limited ability to converse with my mum in Vietnamese. There are people in USA who are Vietnamese with children also of Vietnamese descent. Those children are demanding their parents purchase a Tesla for them, so they can learn to drive. I am looking for Vietnamese words to describe spoilt and self-entitled brats who have no clear thought of the struggles their ancestors went through. Google&#x27;s translate is tự cho mình quyền doesn&#x27;t cut it at all. Help please 🙏

Should I pick up a bag at Highlands (or is that like going to Starbucks and getting a bag in the US to being elsewhere?) Are there smaller brands to support and where can I buy them?

                              <span>I entered a one way road by mistake while I was following google maps. There was no signage and the cops caught me. I expected a 500.000vnd maximum fine, but they took away my license and told me to pay 3Million or they won&#x27;t return it. 
 I tried telling them it&#x27;s way too much but the cop outright said if I keep asking him to reduce the fine, he&#x27;ll revoke my license. He wasn&#x27;t even ready to accept my reason. 
 I didn&#x27;t have that much cash so he told me to call a friend and ask or to go to the ATM and get it.
 Do I need to pay this much money every time they stop me? I&#x27;m a foreigner and I&#x27;m new to Hanoi. This was a horrible experience. I understand that they take bribes but 3mil was over the top!

                              <span>Just for context, my family are southerner and we immigrated to the US around 1970s to 2000s and I was always taught by my family that southern Vietnamese are often nicer and easier to hangout with when compared to the northern region. Based on my own experience and experience from my family, this is often true. My dad told that Northerner struggled a lot before and after the war and so they have to work hard to make money and get fed, and that often can translate to behavior of taking advantage of other people. What are your guys experience about this? Not trying to start any fights, just curious if this is something that people can generally agreed on or just a lens from my own experience and not neccesary apply to many others.

                              <span>What is the reality of finding a job in VN for an American ? My wife is Vietnamese and recently floated the idea of moving back VN ( Ho Chi Minh City )so her parents can help us raise our daughter. I don’t speak Vietnamese. I’m guessing I’d be better off finding seasonal work in the US and see my family part time ? This is all hypothetical at the moment.

                              <span>I know, it’s been discussed many times, but i am curious to hear it from the latest visitors. Is a Ha Long Bay cruise worth it? On one hand there’s a nice experience with good views ( as they say) - one another hand theres a 150€ price tag per person, rumors of tons of floating trash that ruins everything, lots of cruises that crowd the area, and it gets boring after a while? What is your experience, thanks

                              <span>Did I offend a bellhop?
 I was traveling with my family and allowed a bellhop to carry our bags into our room. Me and my wife stayed in our rooms and my children in another room. He gave us our luggage and my children tipped him 10,000 dong. At the time it was all we had to tip so we just left it at that. Strangely enough my children found the tip money slipped under their room door.
 Did the bellhop return it out of distaste that it was too little or any other reason? From what I can recall tipping is not mandatory and I thought that amount was better than nothing. Thoughts?
 *Edit: Thank you everyone for your input. I could understand it could be bc the tip came from my children and accepting it was against some moral code or out of pity. It also could be possible that he thought the tip was way too low; Ill never know unless I hear it from him.
 *It is very interesting to hear everyones opinion about tipping as well. I do believe that extraordinary service should be rewarded, but if a tip is given, it should be a worthwhile amount.

                              <span>Long story short, my parents didn’t teach me vietnamese well in my childhood because they were scared I would have an accent when speaking english. I know basic vietnamese, especially when listening, but I’m horribly anxious to speak it. I’ve bought books and flashcards and courses and still have been having trouble learning, partly because I’m used to the southern dialect, which conflicts with a lot of resources on learning the language. Are there any tricks to learning vietnamese? I want to be able to visit vietnam and speak fluently and not look like some americanized idiot.

                              <span>I actually don&#x27;t give a shit about VN any more than any SEA country (although VN is lovely) but I can&#x27;t but notice all the anti-VN posts lately, and it&#x27;s weird for someone in SEA to hear complaints of:
 - Bad driving
 - Litter
 - Selfishness ?
 - Rats
 - Game shows
 - Toilets (paper)
 - Social Toxicity
 What&#x27;s going on? The last week this sub has faced a steady stream of complaints that VN has the same problems of all SEA nations. What&#x27;s happened? Did everyone decide to do on holiday to VN and then moan about it? Or has reddit decided to bombard me with silly posts.
 I&#x27;m really confused, what&#x27;s happening in this sub? I follow this sub to keep up to date with things in VN. I&#x27;m not that interested in complaints about the traffic and TBH I have no idea who is so shocked that traffic in a SEAsian nation is awful.
 IDK. Maybe I&#x27;m out of touch
 Eddit: And the next post I see is someone complaining about stomach upset from the local diet

                              <span>Is it just me or their game show nowadays actually cringe. I swear every time I turn them on, people on the game show are loud asf, thinking their jokes are funny when they say it out loud at 100000000 decibel. Moreover, why are there so many of them and they mostly have the same MC and directors?

                              <span>Hey guys! So my son will be born in a month. My wife and I have bought a lot of stuff but I was just reading on another Reddit page about how a lot of stuff you really don’t need to buy new and you can find the majority of what you need on “buy nothing” groups, especially since a lot of the stuff is used for such a short term that it’s still practically new anyways. 
 I searched on Facebook hoping to find a local group like that in HCMC and…nothing. Can’t say I’m surprised tbh 😂 but then again, maybe I wasn’t looking hard enough? Please let me know if you are aware of a group like that for my area. Thanks guys!

You try to cross a road, no one cares, they try to gun their motorbike to beat you there first. You try to walk into a narrow doorway and the person next to you does everything in their power to bullrush past you to get through first. No manners in this culture. I hate visiting here.

                              <span>So some of you probably heard of the shitstorm the influencer Thao Ni Le is going through at the moment. Although it’s nothing new at all that these internet celebs jump on any topic that promises to be generating clicks and views, it’s somehow still mind boggling to me that a Viet Kieu (from Germany) coming to Vietnam, rises to fame here, and then learning absolutely nothing about Vietnam’s history and touches a topic that’s highly sensitive here. While on holidays. Via Instagram. 
 So my question is: What do you think about Viet Kieus coming to Vietnam and claiming to be genuine Vietnamese (obviously for career moves) and is the general public aware of that behavior?

 I&#x27;ll be moving to Hanoi soon, and was hoping someone could help suggest a great health club in Hanoi with access to a gym, pool, steam room, sauna (and cherry on the top - ice bath!) Does such a gym exist? And, if so, what would the rates be?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I’m a Korean American expat based in South Korea the past 16 yrs. For the first time, my Korean native gf, her brother, and I visited Ho Chi Minh for a week July 22-28. I know the saying is visiting and living are two different things.. 
 Nonetheless, we had a blast. Stayed in an Airbnb at Vinhomes Central Park and went to a good mix of touristy foodie spots many near Ben Thanh Market and to local spots around the city where we couldn’t use any English to order. 
 We were quite surprised by the weather temperatures as we were expecting hot weather similar to Thailand but it was rather cool the entire time. It’s actually hotter and more humid in Korea right now.
 Never visited Bui Vien Walking street as my gf and I aren’t heavy party-goers or drinkers (I’m in my early 40’s and she’s in her late 30’s and we’ve had our fair share of debauchery in our 20’s and early 30’s). Her brother was keen on checking it out but we just never made it.
 The only thing I wish I was able to check out is the bjj/mma/combat sports scene as I’ve been training myself the last 9 yrs in Korea. Saw a few bjj gyms I wanted to check out but also didn’t want to be selfish and take away from the time I should be spending with my gf and her brother. Am curious as to what the scene is like in Vietnam if anyone that trains would care to share.
 Here are some photos of our trip as well. A bunch of the cliché touristy spots. I’m also a photographer so I prefer shooting with my dslr rather than a phone and edited the photos in my editing style which might not be the best or most realistic representation of the places. But these the ones I’ve shared to my sns. 
 We absolutely loved Ho Chi Minh and are keen to visit Hanoi the next time we make it back.
 Been lurking in this sub the last week to gain insight into this fascinating country and would love to hear any and all experiences, both good and bad, from those actually living here if anyone cares to share.

                              <span>What does a real &quot;local&#x27;s&quot; party look like? My wife is Colombian and thinks that Vietnamese people don&#x27;t really party...they only drink beers and sing karaoke at home...All the clubs in the cities are for Westerners playing the same stupid songs over and over... Are there real Vietnamese dance parties? Huge clubs or events where people dance, drink, laugh, and get sweaty all night? If so, where?! What type of music are people dancing to? What districts do these things happen in? Are there any good videos of the party scenes?

                              <span>I was at night market. Went to the clothing shop. Two ladies were bargaining for something. And one of them was repeating &quot;Give me for 210 and I&#x27;m gonna leave you alone&quot; many times. Dude was fixed at 250. But they were pushing him so hard to go for 210. Also they were talking in English very fast. So he couldn&#x27;t understand anything except number 210. I mean I know you can bargain but isn&#x27;t it too much? Or is it pretty common to haggle at that level?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 so I got addicted to coconut coffee, and especially the roasted (I think) coconut pieces on the top of it. Anyome knows what its called, and if I can buy that in shops? I will be eternally grateful, and pay for your first 5 beers in Hanoi or HCM.

                              <span>My grandmother recently passed away in February. I wasn’t very close to her, but my family asked if my mom and I were going back to Vietnam next year for my grandmother’s first death anniversary. My mom definitely intends on visiting for 3 weeks, and she asked me if I can request work off to go with her (for 2-3 weeks). I currently work at a ski resort, and February is our busiest time of the year. To be honest, I don’t really want to go. I feel uncomfortable staying with my family for various reasons; I would also be going from below freezing now in high elevation to a humid tropical climate, but most of all I always feel anxious around my Mom. I had also been talking about and planning a trip with my partner to go to Italy for a week in March, so I’m not even sure if I’d be allowed to take that much time off in such a short amount of time. My mom says the first death anniversary is very important, so would I be ostracized by my family if I don’t go?

                              <span>Khoảng 8 năm trở lại đây mình thấy MV Việt chất lượng càng ngày càng tăng (từ hồi có Sơn Tùng?). MV có đầu tư, sáng tạo, xem rất đã, cảm thấy chả thua gì mấy nước giầu, ăn đứt mấy nước khác trong khu vực (trừ Thái Lan). Chắc có một phần nhờ camera bây giờ rẻ, phần mềm chỉnh sửa mạnh hơn ngày xưa.
 Mình tổng hợp thử 1 playlist những MV có production value cao mà hoa hết cả mắt:
 https://youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLDjUb6e81MyYcCmBL--8HCVIuDZXqwQJn
 Một cái mình thấy hay của âm nhạc Việt Nam gần đây là nhiều nghệ sĩ hàng đầu/mainstream đi lên từ viral/indie như Sơn Tùng, Đen, Da LAB, Vũ, Ngọt, Cá Hồi Hoang,... Chắc do nền công nghiệp âm nhạc Việt Nam còn non trẻ nên có nhiều cơ hội cho người nghiệp dư hơn. Rồi còn nhờ có các kênh mạng xã hội như Youtube, Soundcloud,... nữa.
