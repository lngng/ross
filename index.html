                              <span>Having a hard time locating and contacting a simple luggage repair service in HCM. 
 Per the below really only need a zipper be brought back into the zipline so I assume a shoe repair service could do that to?
 Im in D4 but willing to travel a reasonable amount.

                              <span>I (19M, US Citizen) am interested in moving to Vietnam for about a year or two (I am a freelance artist, and that&#x27;s what I plan to do while I&#x27;m there). I want to move to Northern Lào Cai in a studio somewhere in a city where I can retain most of my standard of living. It&#x27;s right next to China which would make border runs every 90 days very easy (With China&#x27;s 10-year multi-entry visa.) 
 I was doing some research for it but I just couldn&#x27;t find the answers to the questions I had. 
  
Is Lào Cai more rural or urban?
 Why can&#x27;t I find any studios for rent there? (Maybe I haven&#x27;t looked hard enough, but every search just shows places in Ho Chi Minh)
 Is Lào Cai relatively safe?
 Rough monthly Cost of living (I am extremely frugal and willing to make sacrifices to get by if need be, I really only need water, safe housing, and internet/phone services for my work)
  
Thank you in advance for the help, I don&#x27;t speak a lick of Vietnamese yet so it was difficult to translate through all the websites and still find nothing.

                              <span>Has anyone seen this saying written in colonial-era sources? “The Vietnamese plant rice, the Cambodians watch it grow and the Lao listen to it grow.” 
 I’m not familiar with Khmer or Lao cultures. Is there any grain of truth to the stereotype?

                              <span>My partner loves vietamese dramas but doesn&#x27;t watch them much since coming to my country as she doesn&#x27;t really watch them alone and used to view with her mither. I&#x27;m not a big drama show person, but, I think it would make her really happy to watch them with her so I&#x27;d like to try them out. Also, I&#x27;m sure once I start watching they&#x27;d grow on me quite a bit. 
 Does anyone know of any sites that provide English subs? I&#x27;ve found one I think but it ends up being very selective on what show, movie, or episode has the subs.

                              <span>I recently came across some Messages between my bf and his sister in law, they were talking in Vietnamese although I’m not fluent I can make out a few words, they continuously call each other em yieu and Anh yieu. I know yieu means love. When I asked him about it he said that it’s normal to bwteen sisters and brothers to say that to each other , but I’ve never heard him call his own biological sisters by that kind of name . I just want to know is this appropriate or normal in Vietnam tradition to call brother in laws and sister in laws Anh yieu and em yieu?

                              <span>This r/place event shows how poor Vietnam&#x27;s internet culture is when many Vietnamese first use a global, mixed-country social network. Most Vietnamese people only use Facebook or TikTok to chat with fellow countrymen in their community. So, like fish in a pond going to sea, some embarrassing aspects can be seen:
 Weird nationalism is most evident when a propaganda poster is the first choice of art to show Reddit about our country. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with wanting to show sovereignty, but this event isn&#x27;t the place to do it. So among various creative artworks, the propaganda poster appears very out of place. We could&#x27;ve drawn cultures, buildings, or famous people instead. If you use Facebook a lot, you can also see for yourself how obsessed Vietnamese are with nationalism.
 Facebook doesn&#x27;t have a clear upvote and downvote system like Reddit, so many Vietnamese people who only use Facebook have the habit of commenting mindlessly in their own way and get downvoted straight away as a result when they comment on Reddit. That illustrates how poor their reasoning and chatting skills are.
 Vietnamese Facebookers and tiktokers tend to follow the crowd and blame others. When the Vietnamese artwork expanded, there were thousands of copy-paste comments with empty apologies and blaming an unknown third party. But without doing anything to fix it, the affected communities have to do it themselves. They only care to save their faces to feel good while doing nothing.
 As a Vietnamese person myself, I used to use Facebook a lot in the past, but nowadays I barely use it because of the terrible internet culture in Vietnam. After finding out about Reddit, I find it a much better social media platform for entertainment and discussion. Engaging in Vietnamese Facebook posts is just really frustrating to me.

 Ý thức kém xong nói thế này thế kia. Đến lúc raid ngược thì chịu lại đổ lỗi. Nói thật chứ các ông làm ăn nó cũng 1 vừa 2 phải thôi chiếm thế này hội xQc nó raid cả bức cũng không ngoa. Làm ơn hãy có ý thức đừng chỉ vì 1 bộ phận newbie từ stream Độ qua mà cả cộng đồng ae redditer Việt Nam chân chính bị mang tiếng xấu!!! Thanks

                              <span>Yêu nước là tốt, nhưng giờ thông điệp và độ thẩm mỹ đã đi quá xa so với dự kiến ban đầu
 Mọi người thấy đấy, ban đầu mục đích ý nghĩa là tuyên truyền về chủ quyền biển đảo bằng hình ảnh Việt Nam và hai quần đảo, rất đẹp, rất ý nghĩa.
 NHƯNG
 Sau khi bành trướng. Thêm mấy hình công nông bộ đội vào to hơn hẳn cả hình ảnh đất nước và hai quần đảo. Chủ thể lúc này đã bị chuyển đổi, ý nghĩa cũng đã bị thay đổi theo. Tấm hình giờ rất không khác gì một tấm pano áp phích cổ động những năm 80 và ý nghĩa về chủ quyền biển đảo cũng không còn nữa.
 Tôi yêu nước, nhưng tôi cũng chả đồng tình cái cách những lá cờ nhạt nhẽo (Đặc biệt là cái Pano VN hiện tại) của các nước lấn át những bức art thực sự , phá huỷ hoàn toàn công sức tạo nên các bức art tuyệt mỹ đó của các hội nhóm khác.
 Các bạn nên bớt rảnh lại, và đừng lôi vấn đề yêu nước lấp liếm hành vi phá hoại này lại ngay. Mục đích của chúng ta đã đạt được từ cách đây hơn 24h trước rồi. Cộng đồng reddit đang chửi chúng ta như chửi chó kia kìa

Preferably lightweight and good to share? Or you can even tell me what to avoid! Are there cheaper grocery stores too or are the prices similar?

                              <span>Hi guys I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right sub to ask this qn, if it&#x27;s not pls direct me to the correct one 🙏.
 So I&#x27;m a JC student from Singapore and towards the end of the year a grp of us are going to visit several orphanages in Ho Chi Minh to entertain the children there as part of a school organised trip. We have come up with several activities to accommodate the kids as many of them have either physical or mental disabilities.
 One of the ideas that I proposed which got the go ahead was to play some songs on the recorder for the kids. I heard that music can be very engaging towards those that have mental disabilities. Some advice that I received was to pick songs that would be familiar to the kids so that they could enjoy it.
 So is there any song recommendations that the kids would know? Vietnamese nursery rhymes? Anything along that vein? Although I do have a musical background I have not touched the recorder in quite a while. So songs that might be too complicated would be a no go HAHA.
 Anyways thanks for reading, have a great day!

                              <span>1) I’m a vegetarian visiting Vietnam (Saigon) for the first time. What food options will be available for me and what should I look for?
 2) Where to get best prices for currency exchange? INR to VND
 3) I want to explore Vietnam like a local and understand the daily life, culture, food (veg only though), shop, etc. what do I do? Where do I go? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Long story short, I’m going to be meeting my biological family for the first time in-person in a few months. I am from the US. What would be good gifts for when I meet them? If it helps, I am from New York so there’s the possibility of bringing cool things from NYC. 
 I want to get something for my birth mom, brother, his wife, and their two young children.

                              <span>While most was watching Messi&#x27;s first game in the US. I was ecstatic about US vs VN. The game was better than expected only because I thought US was going to cut through VN like butter. Although offense and counter attack was so so defense was great and to block a penalty kick by Alex Morgan. Miss T. T. Kim Thanh is the MVP in my book for that. Needless to say USA might struggle for the 3 peat.

                              <span>Some kind hearted people decided to burn their mattresses and other rubbish right next to the English center I work at. I understand it&#x27;s the country side and it&#x27;s common to burn trash. But why right next to the school. The whole road is empty , yet they choose to burn next to the school and fill the rooms with toxic plastic smoke. It&#x27;s disgusting and terrible for all the children and adults health.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve observed that Vietnamese individuals rarely engage in serious academic or scientific discussions on Facebook. Content channels that focus on science are carefully curated, making it challenging for them to become popular. Instead, groups that boast about achievements, offer humor, or criticize celebrities tend to gain significant traction. This has always piqued my curiosity, as finding groups that genuinely provide valuable knowledge is a rarity. If you happen to know any such groups, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it if you could share their names and information!
 Regarding the group I&#x27;m currently enjoying, it can be found at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/vietnambinhan.

                              <span>I think this is the problem that some of us are facing when having typical Asian parents. The relationship between me (26) and my mom (65 years old) is really bad that we didn’t have a proper conversation for 10 years (+). It&#x27;s not that she did anything wrong, it&#x27;s just the age gap between us that makes us hard to understand each other. And the things she thoughts were good for me made me felt uncomfortable and pushed me further away from her. I wouldn’t go in details but I think we all understand what they are.
 I left the country when I was 16 years old and leave far away from her since then. But because of that reason, our relationship is getting better. I only came to visit once before Covid. And that visit turned out terrible. As soon as we spoke to each other, we fight. I then came to the conclusion that as long as I kept a safe distance from her, our relationship will be improved.
 I can tell that she is trying to fix our relationship in recent years. Every time she called me, she really tried to not say anything wrong or to upset me. The things she did wrong that hurt me, she no longer does. It&#x27;s just the negative feelings toward her that already haunted me.
 I wanted to try, but the idea of speaking to her itself made me feel uncomfortable, not to mention the long quiet between us. 
 In the last couple of years, I don&#x27;t really find myself trying to improve the relationship anymore. I am happy without speaking to her, although I still endear her a lot. To make up for my neglect, I take care of her by sending money back to Vietnam. I understand that it&#x27;s not enough. And as her child, I need to do more for her.
 But she is getting older, I know that any conversation I have with her could be the last one. I am too scared of the idea that I will regret not taking action sooner one day. However, I don’t know how to fix this and where to start with. My Vietnamese fellow, if you were in the same situation, could you give me some suggestions?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I’m just a foreigner who is living in Vietnam, but I feel I have a right to bring this up, probably brought up many times. 
 But this is without a doubt one of the most beautiful places in the world, but it is disgusting to see people throw trash on the ground, even trash covering the roads in rural areas, I am en route to Nha Trang by bus and our driver just pulled over outside someone’s home in the Minh province, throw three iced coffee cups out the door, got out to have a smoke and threw the butt towards the homes driveway. 
 Serious questionable mentality with some people here. Need to start treasuring this amazing country they have and not treat it as a landfill. My Vietnamese girlfriend along with our mutual Vietnamese friends, all in our mid 20’s to early 30’s are disgusted by it also. Shit behaviour

                              <span>First and for most thank you for reading this,
 For context, I moved to California when I was in 4th grade. I&#x27;ve studied in America for almost 10 years. I&#x27;ve struggled and pulled through a lot, and I&#x27;ve been accepted to a very well-known university (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) in California for engineering (highly recruited and famous among all tech companies). 
 My options were: UCSB, UCD, Cal Poly, and UCI. I chose Cal Poly. 
 I can stay in America and make a lot of money, but my parents are getting old and I planned to live near them. I can write and speak in both Vietnamese and English, but I prefer English as my main language (writing in Vietnamese can be a struggle). 
 Since, I have lived in America for so long, I&#x27;m not familiar with the job prospect in Vietnam. I hope to work for a foreign company in Vietnam that pay me well for my prestigious foreign degree and skills.
 Therefore, I need advice on what kind of engineering or degree would yield me the most job prospect in Vietnam. 
 Options: Computer Engineering, Data Science &amp; Statistics, Mechanical Engineering, or Business 
 Any insights or combinations of degrees that would optimize my salary would be greatly appreciated. Any kind of experience or companies that I can focus to break into? 
 I plan on getting an MS degree also.
 Please give me a reasonable salary range that I can expect to work in Vietnam for a foreign company.
 My parents live in HCM City. 
 If you spend time reading all of this to understand my situation, I hope you know that I greatly appreciate your time. I consider Vietnam my hometown, and a place that I love. Thank you so much!

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m currently on a mission to find the perfect spot for a special life event - proposing to my girlfriend of six years. We are going to travel to Vietnam in the middle of September, and we will start our trip in the north around Sa Pa. Then, we will probably continue gradually to the south.
 I don&#x27;t think I will be able to keep this secret for so long, so I&#x27;m searching for a good, quiet, and romantic place, probably in the north of Vietnam. However, if there is something worth considering in the South, I will be open to it :)
 I would really appreciate your personal recommendations for a romantic location.
 Thanks in advance!

I was a bit shocked considering it&#x27;s Vietnam? Is this normal or was I scammed. It wasn&#x27;t in a hospital it was in a pharmacy, not to mention it was cash only! I&#x27;ve no proof except their own written prescription for insurance to claim it back

                              <span>My mother was born and raised in Saigon and fled after the war to America. I&#x27;m American born and don&#x27;t really speak Viet. Growing up, I remember tons of &quot;us vs. them&quot; stories and how the sound of northern accent can instantly put them (moms family) into an angry and aggressive mode. I never really gave it much thought because I&#x27;m American. I&#x27;ve only visited Vietnam twice years ago.
 Anyways I&#x27;ve lived in Japan for a few years and met a girl from Hanoi. I&#x27;ve never dated a Vietnamese girl before and honestly never thought I would. Conversation wise and personality wise, I think we get along quite well. It&#x27;s funny because we have to communicate in Japanese, which is neither of our mother tongues. I&#x27;m now more motivated to improve my Vietnamese, and her English is making good progress too.
 We aren&#x27;t dating officially, but both of us are definitely interested in next steps. We are both 30+ so I think we both recognize the need for discretion and caution, to respect each other&#x27;s time, feelings, and limitations. I need to be in America for the time being so it would be long distance. 
 My main concern is regarding potential culture clashes with her being from the north. I hate to say it but my family is so judgmental and can be blindly toxic. Im really worried how my mom would react. I know it&#x27;s illogical and kinda racist behavior so before people attack my mother, please understand that she comes from war torn Vietnam and we have lost numerous family members during the war. They have serious trauma associated with the northern accent, and I would like to hear what others think and how their experiences have fared.
 Any thoughts, advice or discussion is welcome. Thank you for sharing your experiences and keeping it civil.

                              <span>It is said that after China was conquered by the Manchus, they were polluted by the barbarian culture. Many Sinosphere nations wanted to invade the Qing Dynasty and restore China. It is said that Gia Long planned an invasion, which never came to fruition. 
 However, Vietnamese clothing showed signs of evolving to be more like the Manchu Qizhuang in the late-19th century for some reason.
 Before that, Vietnamese clothes were more flowy like Chinese and Korean ones. Japanese ones weren’t so flowy but they didn’t look like Manchu ones.
 Why?

Rushed back to my hotel and downed a hydration pack. Is this normal? Does the body adjust? Everyone else at the gym had the normal amount of sweat. I didn’t even lift heavy!

                              <span>I love coffee in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve lived in Vietnam for 8 years now and coffee is 20℅ of the reason for that. I&#x27;m married and my wife and I have a daughter. 
 We&#x27;ve travelled a lot and stayed at a lot of different hotels and resorts. One thing my wife and I have always noticed, the coffee at these resorts is terrible. 
 How can a resort that charges 1.7 mill a night make worse coffee than Ca Phe 123 I can find down some random street who only charges 25k? 
 My wife says it&#x27;s becuase the resort wants to make it for western customers, but a place like Vin Pearl has 90℅ Vietnamese guests. 
 Like, go to any cafe with plastic tables and chairs and I would bet money their coffee will be better than a 5 star resort. What&#x27;s up with that?

                              <span>The current game of Vietnam vs the USA has all the makings of a possible upset. I have not heard much hype from my Vietnamese friends and coworkers. Sadly they seemed more excited about Messi debuting for Miami. I would hope that there are world cup viewings setup in Ho Chi Minh and other major cities; to show support for these women.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an American expat in Taiwan but my wife is Vietnamese hence why I lurk on this sub. I noticed that there seem to be a lot of salty redditors on this sub who seem to think that all white expats in Vietnam are sex tourists, and dating the locals is an expression of &quot;attempting to quench their thirst for submissive Asian girls&quot;. Pretty much every post here where an expat gets scammed by a bar girl has at least one or two redditors celebrating their misfortune.
 I don&#x27;t see this attitude nearly so much in Taiwan. Nobody seems to have much of a problem with expats dating and marrying locals, and I seldom here any accusations of less than honorable motivations for doing so. 
 Is it that Vietnam attracts a particularly unsavory variety of expat? Are Vietnamese men more xenophobic than their Taiwanese counterparts? Is this particular subreddit just a little bit more toxic than it&#x27;s Taiwanese counterpart? 
 Partially curious just for shits and giggles, but also trying to get a feel for what living in Vietnam would be like and the attitudes of locals towards expats in case the misses and I ever decide to relocate there.

Just ordered one large gin and tonic. Out 30 USD but could have been worse. Never ran into this situation in other countries but seems extremely common in hanoi. 
 Oh well. Live and learn.

                              <span>Welcome to my TED talk,
 My background: born and raised in Vietnam, studied and worked in the UK for 11 years. I&#x27;m planning to go back to Vietnam in near future and being super irritated at the quality of media being fed to the general public as a whole, especially younger generation in the country.

                              <span>One thing I find peculiar, from what I&#x27;ve been told, whether foreigner or citizen, all properties require a 30% upfront down payment in order to qualify for or be approved for a loan from a financial institution? Is this correct? Not yet in the process of buying but considering it among other options in VN and in the region. Can anyone share personal experiences of buying as a foreigner or married to VN partner? I understand that VN is a fast growing economy and the housing market is rapidly changing and have also heard many opinions on whether it is a financially sound decision in regards to the current and projected state of the market and quality of purchased unit. Can anyone share a personal experience?

                              <span>Looking to hire a Saigon lawyer to navigate the court system.
 Any advice or recommendation for a lawyer dealing with property dispute?
 How fair/corrupt is the court system?
 Is it common in VN, for a lawyer to work for opposing sides?
 Do lawyer takes money/favors from both sides?
 Is it also common for judges accept bribery?
 Any experience would be useful.

                              <span>Hello! So recently I went to HCMC. The food and the places were amazing, but the one thing I can’t get out of my mind are the dogs around the city. At first I just saw one dog of a particular breed which is supposed to be “regular-sized” and thought that must’ve been a mixed dog. However, the more I explored the city, the more dogs I saw that had short and stubby legs (they are all different breeds btw). I even went on a Mekong delta tour and even the dogs on the island we went to were stubby as well. Can someone explain this to me or is it all just a coincidence? I’m genuinely curious about this as I’ve thought about it for a good amount of time on the flight home lol.
  
I read somewhere that they’re tiny mainly to fit them in smaller apartments/housing around the city. But why not get dogs of a small breed to begin with? 
 
A local humored us by saying that dogs are smaller so that they can be eaten easily (pls don’t be true T_T)

                              <span>Hi, probably not the best place to ask (already booked a doctors appointment to talk to a GP). 
 2-3 weeks ago I was travelling in Vietnam and went to the Cu Chi tunnels. There was a couple bats in there. While going through one the tunnels a bat flew at me, bounced off my torso and flew away. The contact was very brief and I didn’t feel like it scratched/bit me but after seeing some fearmongering tiktoks (haha cringe I know) they were saying you should get a rabies vaccine/immunoglobulin even if it didn’t bite you as the bites can go unnoticed due to their small size. It’s been 17 days since the bat flew into me. 
 Should I be worried? Is lyssavirus common for bats in the area or have their been many cases? Tried to find some vietnam specific info but no luck. I know in Australia (where I am from and where I am now) that contact with bats is typically treated for rabies. 
 Will definitely take the advice of the GP once we’ve talked but just wanted to know if any of you guys have had similar experiences or any knowledge.

                              <span>I live in US and plan to travel to Vietnam with family in August, flying into Hanoi. First time visiting Vietnam. I saw a post about getting money exchanged at jewelry shops, and all ATMs charge crazy fees. So, wondering if I need to get some VND in US before I fly over since it might take some time for me to find a jewelry store. Or perhaps I can use USD if I can&#x27;t find a jewelry shop?

                              <span>I was online searching for COVID mask rules, but the most of them seems to be out dated.
 What are the current rules and what does the most people do? I plan to be in cities and on country sites.
 I will bring spear masks for the pollution, but the question is, if it is also necessary for COVID.

                              <span>American citizen here, looking to go spend some time in Vietnam &amp; escape the U.S bc of the current state of things. Was curious, can I get an ADHD diagnosis/assessment &amp; possibly medication in Vietnam as a U.S citizen? I’ve been trying dearly to get it done in the U.S but it is so expensive &amp; just trying to find a psychologist is complicated. &amp; how is healthcare there for a U.S citizen? Is it free or low cost? Do I need to be insured etc? Any insight helps truly, thank you!

                              <span>So I’ve been back in Vietnam for over 1.5 month now. But it seems to be very hard to find the right place to meet people around my age (21). Anyone that can help me out with potential places that are knowingly open for conversation and meeting people (Ho Chi Minh City).

I know my wife will not get on a motorcycle and is not great with heights. Is there any other way for us to enjoy this area without scaring her to death :).
 Thanks for your help…

                              <span>Chào mọi người! Sự kiện thu hút nhiều sự quan tâm của Reddit đã trở lại rồi và bất cứ ai cũng có thể tham gia bằng cách truy cập vào r/place.
 Để có thể phối hợp tốt hơn, các bạn nên tham gia vào hai Discord server dưới đây:
  
Server của r/vietnam tại https://discord.gg/HRvPMnKzBA
 Server được tạo cho sự kiện r/place tại https://discord.gg/r-placevietnam-960076480916901948. Lưu ý rằng nó không được vận hành bởi các mod của r/vietnam.
  
Chúc các bạn chơi r/place vui vẻ.
 Và đừng tạo những bài viết mới về r/place nhé. Như vậy làm sub rất giống bị spam. Cảm ơn các bạn!
  
Hey r/vietnam homies! The epic pixel art battle of r/place is returning in 2023. Let&#x27;s represent Vietnam with some sick pixel art!
 For better teamwork, we have two discord servers that you can join: 
  
The official r/vietnam discord server at https://discord.gg/HRvPMnKzBA
 
The Vietnamese r/place community server at https://discord.gg/r-placevietnam-960076480916901948. It&#x27;s specifically for r/place but just remember it&#x27;s not run by the r/vietnam mods.
 
 Let&#x27;s have fun and make friends with all the communities. And of course, don&#x27;t forget to occasionally touch grass and stay hydrated when placing those pixels ;)
 See you on the canvas, you creative geniuses!
 And please don&#x27;t flood the sub with new r/place posts. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 In May this year I spent about a week in Da Nang and I really enjoyed my stay there.
 I am planning to do another Vietnam trip soon and want to know if there are any good (multi-day)hikes in/around Da Nang?
 Thanks!

                              <span>At first the seller told me $60 which is 1.418.400 VND.
 The item is a jacket and the box is sized accordingly. I made a shipping box of the dimensions and I got a quote from Vietnam post’s website. I input all the details and I received the estimate cost of 426.900
 I asked the seller how come there’s a difference between the quote and the estimate and they told me it will be higher and sent me a screenshot of a page from bill.ems.com.vn and the quote came to 2.208.600 VND
 Is this correct? I just want to make sure because usually government post is not that high priced.
 Thanks in advance
 Edit: to clarify the 426.900 I have mentioned is the EMS option from Vietnam Post

We are excited to welcome everyone back, as well as newcomers to enlist in our effort to once again establish and defend a bright point of the &quot;Front Page of the Internet&quot;.
 Again, please come in, make yourselves at home, grab a ca phe da and your trusty netrunning machines, and start laying down those pixels!

 I&#x27;m planning a trip to Vietnam and I&#x27;m wondering what the weather is like in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City during the month of August. I&#x27;ve heard that it can be rainy during this time, but I&#x27;m not sure what to expect.
 If you&#x27;ve been to these cities during this time, can you share your experience? Did the rain impact your itinerary or were you still able to enjoy your trip? Any tips on what to pack or how to prepare for the weather would be greatly appreciated.
 Also, if you have any recommendations for must-see sights or hidden gems in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, please feel free to share!
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Hello so I’m traveling to Saigon in 2025 and will be there for a year and I want to make sure I can still get my estrogen and spiro while over there I’ve heard that you can go to a pharmacity and get it over the counter just by paying for it easily is this true? Can someone tell me how can I still get hormone medication while in Saigon?

 6 years ago my husband and I visited the Pearl farm in Ha Long Bay and bought a simple pearl necklace that now has more sentimental value than everything I own put together.
 The chain broke so I visited a local jewelers to get it fixed and they contacted me today to say they&#x27;ve lost it.
 I am absolutely heartbroken.
 If there are any travelers on their way there that live in the UK please let me know 🙏🏻

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping to shop for some tailor made suits in Hoi An in two months, but am visiting several other cities after that. Is it feasible/reasonable to have my suits shipped to my HCMC hotel as that&#x27;s my final destination in the country? Any insight on the price/time/logistics for that? I&#x27;m not concerned about bringing them on my final flight home and would rather not deal with international shipping.

                              <span>Hi there!
 Husband and I (both EU nationals) are moving to HCMC soon and will be living there on student visas. Looking at our health insurance options, I would really like to hear about your experiences. We&#x27;re both in our 30s, no pre-existing conditions, no kids in our present or future, and looking for coverage that goes further than emergencies but doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Any recommendations? 
 Thanks everyone!!

                              <span>Hello,
 My boyfriend and I will be traveling to Hanoi in mid-September. We have heard that it is cheaper to walk in to hotels rather than reserving them online, as the online prices can be much higher. Is this true? And would we be able to find hotels relatively easily by just walking in? Our plan was to book a hotel for the first night or two and then just find another hotel we could walk into.
 Also, does anyone know of a good hotel in Hanoi between $25-40 a night? I&#x27;ve been looking on Agoda.com, but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell if the reviews are real or not.

                              <span>A friend visiting sent me this pic from a domestic flight within Vietnam and asked why this was a thing. After that, I couldn’t stop seeing naked feet everywhere (airports, cafes, parks, bars…) so I guess I was at one point desensitized to it 
 Are naked feet in public fairly accepted or is it a divisive issue?

                              <span>Hey so I just got to Hanoi and my friend matched with a girl on tinder. She took us to a club and proceeded to buy drinks, balloons and food. We spent a couple hundred dollars and the girls still wanted to order more drinks until we said enough is enough. We understand this was a mistake and shouldn’t have signed anything until we knew what we were getting.
 Do these girls work for the club? Do they get commission? 
 Very curious and how to differentiate between a genuine connection vs a scam.

                              <span>Hi there friends, I (24F) and my partner (30M) are moving from the UK to HCMc in September. If anyone is able to offer advice on the following areas that would be really helpful!
  
What resources did you find were best for helping you to learn Vietnamese before moving? Textbooks etc.
  
 What are some rental red flags you&#x27;ve come across? We are hoping to live in D2/D3.
 I have moderate eczema and am curious about how a humid climate will impact that. If anyone in similar positions have found it easy enough to find OTC treatments?
 
  
To round it off if there are people in this subreddit that are also living around HCM and are looking to get a beer or coffee it would be great to make connections!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Visiting Vietnam in a couple of weeks, and wondering if I can get a good deal on a road bike. 
 Bikes are very expensive where I’m coming from, and it’d be great to have recommendations on bike shops/ retailers that frequently run discounts.
 Looking for a carbon frame with Ultegra group set. Not too fussy on the brand, but it’d be good to go with a Tier 1 name (Giant, Trek etc)
 Thanks in advance

 Thank you so much

 Why is that? Any idea? She doesn&#x27;t know and says my app must be wrong. But google translate does it the same way as the app does.

                              <span>So, me and my vietnamese wife plan to retire from U.S. and live in Vietnam. I know i pay taxes for withdrawals from 401k but does Vietnam also tax that income? I would have all of my Social Security and 401k payments put into my US bank and then transferred as needed to Vietnam bank. I&#x27;m just trying to get an idea on what my budget will be like after taxes and such on my 401k and Social Security.

                              <span>Why does every 3rd person insist on inflating prices so much for westerners? I can’t even order a bahn mi now without first asking for the price in case of yet another 60k snack. I will be cooking at home mostly for the next 3 months and heading back to Thailand. It’s a shame these people are ruining tourism and potential income for the rest of the lovely people I meet.

                              <span>I’ve been in Vietnam for the past couple of weeks visiting family and one thing that has been really difficult to witness is seeing how dogs are treated here. We passed by an owner beating a chained up dog and hearing its cries made my heart sink. On other occasions we’ve seen strays and malnourished dogs locked in cages forced to sit in the sweltering heat. This is not to say ALL Viet people treat dogs poorly, but I do sense that maybe dogs are not widely regarded in the same way as back in the States where I am from. 
 As a dog lover, I find the dog meat industry horrible given what I’ve read (dogs are stolen from communities and beaten/tortured/etc or unethical farming practices) but I know to some people it is just viewed as any other type of meat (beef/pork). My hope that this practice dies out, but I know where there’s demand, there will always be people who are willing to supply. This has made me wonder if the dog meat industry is still popular and how local communities view eating dog meat? Are there any hopes of this industry coming to an end?

                              <span>It&#x27;s a pretty hot topic recently. Some parents want their kids to study IELTS really early, like 6-10 years old. 
 Pros: Kids get to learn english very early which will most likely set them for success later on.
 Cons: It puts unnessessary stress on kids, kids can&#x27;t form an opinion about politics yet so the writing task is basically a goner. IELTS is not realistic; real life english is a lot less formal than IELTS.
 I figure if you use Reddit you&#x27;re probably better at English than 99% of native Vietnamese, so the opinions have a bit more merit to it.

                              <span>Whenever I make food that requires you to boil water/food (like pasta or chili), I usually set the food to boil on the stove then go do something else until it&#x27;s time for me to return. Despite this, every time I&#x27;m away from the kitchen for even a few minutes, my family will run into my room and yell at me that my food is boiling like it&#x27;s an emergency or something. And this happens with EVERYONE, dad, mom, grandpa, grandpa, aunts, uncles, cousins... on my dad&#x27;s side and my mom&#x27;s side... ... sometimes multiple times a day.
 This has been the case for as long as I&#x27;ve been cooking, 10+ years now. I can&#x27;t tell if this is a just an older generation thing, a cultural/Vietnamese thing or a my family thing??? I honestly want to know where this stems from. I&#x27;ve told my family that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m supposed to cook the recipe and they don&#x27;t need to worry about the food boiling but they still do it D:
 Does anyone else&#x27;s family does this?

 Also, regulations and such aside, can I expect to run into issues with local law enforcement for carrying a bow? I will be backpacking and it will be inside the pack.

 Anyone have any recommendations? Ones that are relatively affordable 😅😅

I&#x27;m planning on going to Landmark 81 tomorrow but I don&#x27;t want to pay the ridiculous entrance fee. Is there any way I can go up for free (it doesn&#x27;t have to be the top floor observation deck, I just want a good view)? Also, are there any other pretty sights to see?

                              <span>So, my wife and I have decided we are going to try to permanently settle in VN next year.
 I am an Australian citizen and my wife is dual Australian/Vietnamese. Since we have been saving for a house deposit in Australia, we literally have enough $$ for my wife to buy a plot of land and build a house on it in Vietnam, in the area my wife&#x27;s family lives. We want to do that, have a child, and my wife can potentially start a beauty salon in the local town.
 The main requirement for this to actually happen is that I need to be able to work 100% remotely. I am a software developer, and currently working remotely in VN (at the parents&#x27; farm) due to a very flexible company policy that allows me to work up to 4 weeks per year anywhere in the world. This policy is great, but obviously unsuitable for what my wife and I want to do. So the first thing I&#x27;m going to try to do is negotiate a deal with my employer - take a pay cut, work remotely, possibly fly to AU periodically (1 week every 2 months) to do on-prem work to maintain a bit of a physical presence.
 Failing that, I would need to find a remote job. We can probably afford for me to take a 30% cut and still live very comfortably. The trick is finding an employer happy for me to be 100% in VN (I&#x27;m prepared to be very flexible to meet timezone requirements), and possibly dealing with the tax implications of being a foreigner with a foreign job permanently living here (practically - I will be on rolling 5 year visa exemptions unless I get permanent residency).
 I guess my question is - are there people here (particularly software devs) who have done anything similar, and who have any advice about dealing with tax requirements, finding remote employment, etc?
 Any input appreciated!

 I&#x27;m a tourist myself but I would like a more &quot;chill&quot; place/vibe. I like more cozy bars, local food and i just walking around a city. 
 But i don&#x27;t want to be so far off the map where locals give you the &quot;wtf are you doing here&quot; face when you enter a bar or restaurant. Any area recommendations ?

 My 2 cent: Vietnam economy is rising, people are optimistic, they&#x27;re nationalist and would rather stay in Vietnam. The old stereotype of &quot;desperate Vietnamese fleeing the country&quot; is a 80/90s meme back when the country was really, really poor.
 People don&#x27;t want to move outside of the country anymore, aside from the poor region of Vietnam (Nghe An) who want to move abroad so they can send money back to their family.

                              <span>Hi guys, is there any German here who would like to exchange languages with me? I can help with Vietnamese. I’m Vietnamese (25f) and learning German at the moment. But OMG it’s hard. Even though Duolingo helps me a lot, I want to have a chance to talk with real people. Some details about me: - My German now is A1/A2, so basic. - I’m in Ha Noi but not in the center so I would like to do video calls instead of meeting in person. - I’m not a Vietnamese teacher (only tutored math for students in secondary and high school in the past) so I can’t provide you the lessons like a teacher, but I always try my best with what I do. - I also don’t mind about the timezone if you are not in Vietnam at the moment as I’m working for a foreign company so my time is messed up, so if you can only help me at 2am in the morning Vietnam time then that’s totally okay. I can do it. Please send me a dm. I would appreciate your help. Have a wonderful day everyone!!

                              <span>Recently, my new girlfriend and I went on holiday- me caucasian, her Vietnamese. 
 We visited a tourist attraction (not a pagoda or anything remotely religious) in a countryside city. Neither of us had been there before. 
 At this place, I observed on 3 seperate occasions older women staring a me then staring at my girlfriend for a long period of time and giving her a dirty look. 
 2 other women said something disparaging (i believe referring to her as a hooker), as did a young guy. 
 My girlfriend is quite pretty, but she was dressed very modestly - certainly not dressed in a way that was remotely provocative. We only have an age gap of 5 years. We are both friendly and curteous to people we are around. 
 I have never experienced this before. I made me really upset for us. How dare they judge us like that? Who do they think they are to say things like that?
 Is this common, or is this unusual?
 If it is common, how to best deal with this? I felt like accosting them and dressing them down for being so rude, but I did not.

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m heading to Vietnam in a couple weeks and wondering if it&#x27;s possible to rent a bike or join a tour or something where I can cycle down Hai Van Pass?
 Upon reseraching alot of the tours are cycling up it which I&#x27;m not sure if I can physically do. I&#x27;m 30/m/average fitness but not don&#x27;t think I could cycle uphill in the heat. Would prefer to go down the hill at my own pace.

                              <span>We are currently staying in Hanoi and had plans to visit Ha Giang and Ha Long bay. Due to the incoming storm we were considering skipping both and flying out to Da Nang and then Ho Chi Min, as it’s outside of the typhoon path. It’s still raining in both those cities. I know its hard to predict anything regarding the weather, but does anyone have advice/recommendations. Flying back home on 7/26.

                              <span>As title, why are crypto always mentioned when someone ask about sending money aboard? Setting aside the volatilty of crypto (stablecoin isnt stable, binance is not infallible, etc etc), how can you explain the origin of that money? While it is not universal, im pretty sure that there are strict anti money laundering laws in EU/NA. Wouldnt you be forced to declare/taxed on that amount? As crypto gains is taxable.Also, wouldnt it takes a lot of effort to figure out how to do the crypto trading? As there are easier, legal means available (ATM withdrawal with Master/Visa), or plain old Western Union, bank wire transfer? If you want less fees, then there is also currency swapping. 
 Edit: i mean here in reddit. I have seen quite a few posts in here that have comments about using crypto as money transfer method.

                              <span>Hello All,
 I am writing a Vietnamese-Chinese cookbook. I am curious and wanted to write about dishes and their recipes that have derived from Chinese cuisine. I am sure that are a lot of influences from them. Can you please list the dishes name in Vietnamese language and English translation.
 Can you also put in local links where to cook these dishes?
 Thank you so much for your help.

                              <span>Hi all you lovely people!
 I have a question, and I hope I don’t sound ignorant. 
 In the United States, the Vietnam war is easily the second most taught war (only behind WWII) in the 20th century. 
 The blunders, the brutality, the cost of lives on both sides (with an emphasis on Vietnamese citizens) , and whether or not it was needed to check communism (and if it had any effect in doing so) are all frequent topics in history classes. 
 So to the question - how is the war remembered in Vietnam now, and what’s the general consensus on the long term impacts?
 Apologies again for any potential ignorance, but the beauty of reddit is the ability to get information from people you wouldn’t normally meet, and this is a topic I’m genuinely curious about. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, Is anyone here familiar with ATM procedure? My dad forgot to take the card out within the time frame so the machine “swallowed” it. Now, it’d be easy if the card is in my dad’s name. It belongs to my aunt, who moved to the US 8 years ago. It’s her retirement. (In her not so bright moment,) she authorized it to my uncle, dad’s brother, because he lives in HCMC where she got paid from. Đông Á made them signed a separate form of the bank and kept it. Aunt and uncle don’t have a copy. They trusted Đông Á bank when the bank said they only need the government authorization form. Now they wouldn’t let my uncle get a new card. Mind you, the card has to be renew every 4 years and uncle successfully got a new card for dad once. Now the bank did a 180 saying we need to find the person who filed the bank’s form or have the copy in our hands. It’s so ridiculous and we’re at lost. We don’t have immediate relatives working at Đông Á so aunt will have to pay at least $1500 to fly back and sign the form. TL;DR: Đông Á bank asking for a form they have on file to make a new ATM card

 - Both Wise and PayPal are unable to do this because they don&#x27;t allow you to pull money out of a Vietnamese bank account, they only allow sending money in from the UK
 - I found a service called Ezyremit, which is a Vietnamese fintech company based in Australia. Has anyone used this service before and how reliable is it?
 - Is there any other way? I heard that there are some banks that allow you to do this with low fee like HSBC or CitiBank, is that true?

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am a type one diabetic and in Vietnam for the next 3 weeks. After a scary bout of low blood sugar/food poisoning I need help finding Baqsimi. This is a life saving emergency sugar that&#x27;s given through the nose. 
 I have tried three pharmacies (two local ones and one pharmacity.) I haven&#x27;t ran into anyone who has it, can order it or speaks English. 
 Every time I show the counter person a picture they just shake their head no. 
 Would anyone know how to track some down in Hanoi? Would I need to go to the hospital? 
 Please excuse my ignorance. I appreciate any help.

                              <span>Some people say they take Mebendazole to kill intestinal worms. Is that the best medicine? What are the symptoms of a worm infection? After living here in Vietnam for several years, I&#x27;m experiencing a recurring &quot;sour stomach&quot;, for lack of a better description. I&#x27;ll go to my doctor if it persists, but I&#x27;m interested in learning about what people are doing.

                              <span>So I spent a month completing the Pimsleur course for Vietnamese. Unfortunately, there is only 1 level for Vietnamese, where there is typically 5 level. I just came back from a 3 week trip to Vietnam to visit from family and the Vietnamese study prior to going really helped. Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do regarding studies, I liked using pimsleur since it has a structured course to work through and it gives a lot of practice for listening, speaking and writing. Should go back to the basics with grammar textbook or continue to more digital or audio courses?

Renew my Viet passport in Canada can be pretty expensive (CAD$300+) and I feel like I got scammed. I know I cant renew one in Vietnam and send it here by mail. Thanks!!

                              <span>I was talking to a few Vietnamese relatives of mine when I heard about a ranking system that was put in place after 1975 that restricted people from getting jobs or into colleges.They called it &quot;chủ nghĩa lý lịch&quot; and apparently it was from 1 to 14, with 1 being the most advantageous or privileged while 14 was highly disadvantaged. The only information I learnt from them is that my family was 13 and 14 was for Chinese. 
 Does anyone know what the other 12 ranks are and what they mean? I haven&#x27;t been able to find a definitive source listing all of them out, both in English or Vietnamese.

 I am planning to move to Da Nang soon for work. The thing is I am only able to rent an apartment in advance through an agent without seeing everything in person.
 Anyone has a good tips to make sure the whole process is as smooth as possible and the most important thing is not to get scammed.
 I know I should probably get an Airbnb but there are also overpriced problems, fake reviews, bad experience on that app as well. 
 Thanks x 10000. I really appreciate any help and advice.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 You probably have heard this phrase many times. And as a Gen Z, I&#x27;m very sick of it. Like somehow, we become the center of all the bad things on this planet.
 I have many friends who are at my age or younger, and they had already achieved many admirable achievements. The achievements that (in my opinion) could be only in the dream of many people. And that was just in my circle of friends. On the daily news, there were also many youngsters who were managed to bring the pride for the nation despite of their young ages. They might be hard working students, talented athletes, or sometimes, dedicated teenagers who just wanna make change to this world, etc. 
 And after all of that, people choose to pick some of the &quot;thành phần bất hảo&quot; (undesirable person) to represent our whole generation. I mean, what make people think their generations are so superior ? And it is even more annoying when it comes to real life. Some of my &quot;non gen-Z&quot; colleagues in my work place even use that thinking to make fun of my every single opinions. Like... That is how your &quot;grew up&quot; ass should behave ? It is like... people need a dumpster for their toxicity, and somehow, we have become the main object for that.

I’m a single guy and I like to go out so always the possibility I will end up bringing someone back to hotel which seems like not allowed in hotels. Is this only talking about bar girls? Is it only 4/5 star hotels stopping people from bringing guest?
 Saw list online of guest friendly places but don’t want to be limited and most weren’t very nice or had poor reviews.

                              <span>My partner and I are planning our first trip to Vietnam next February and trying to plan our time as best as possible. We want to ensure we get as much in as possible, but we also worry we are moving too fast and not stopping to enjoy each stay enough. I wish we had more time, but we will head to Thailand after this trip and visit family. We will spend roughly ~18 days in each country.
 Nothing is set in stone yet as we are still researching and planning. We would love an outside eye from people with more experience than us. 
 Things we&#x27;ve considered but currently don&#x27;t have on the itinerary as of now, include Sa Pa and the Ha Going loop. My partner is not thrilled with the idea of motorbikes...
 ​
 ​
 Our Current Itenary:
 Day 1 Fly into Da Nang -&gt; Bus to Hoi An
 Day 2-4 Hoi An 
 Day 5 Bus Hoi An -&gt; Hue
 Day 6-7 Hue
 Day 8 Fly (Sleeper bus?) Hue -&gt; Hanoi
 Day 9-10 Hanoi
 Day 11 Bus Hanoi -&gt; Tom Coc
 Day 12-13 Tom Coc
 Day 14 Tom Coc -&gt; Hanoi
 Day 15-17 2 night 3 day Lan Han Bay Cruise
 Day 18 Fly Hanoi -&gt; Bangkok 
 ​
 Any advice or help would be much appreciated!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m looking to ship one medium sized suitcase (43 x 60 x26 cm) from Vietnam to the US at the end of this month. I haven&#x27;t packed and weighed it yet but I&#x27;m hoping 25 kg or less. It&#x27;s too small to move with one of the big international moving companies like Asian Tiger. Does anyone have an experience with companies like ShipMyBag or mybaggage or DHL for shipping luggage out of Vietnam? I&#x27;m interested in:
 (1) price
 (2) how long it took/if anything was lost or damaged
 (3) experiences with customs.
 It would be mostly clothes and souvenirs, no food and maybe a few electronics.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m coming to Vietnam for a month traveling north to south, still in the planning phase but we plan on doing a lot of day hikes and explore outside the main tourist areas, and do some activities like kayaking.
 Usually packing for holidays are quite easy for me to decide but I&#x27;ve never been to East Asia, and the hot weather and possible lots of rain? Makes it hard for me to decide, plus I like to travel light. 
 Warmth wise is there a chance of it getting cold anywhere in August? I&#x27;m wondering if to bring a fleece or micro fleece and a synthetic padded jacket, or if a fleece and windproof jacket might do. Also probably pack a bunch of hiking shorts and 1 pair of hiking trousers.
 Coat, I have a high end thick shell raincoat, under arm zip vents, dosent pack so small into a day bag though, great in the wind, but can imagine sweating loads if it&#x27;s warm and I&#x27;m walking. I have been meaning to get a lighter rain jacket so not sure if it&#x27;s worth getting one instead or if a poncho will be my best friend?
 Shoes, I&#x27;ve got some rugged Sandles, they seem good for the citys and and anywhere near water. Daily shoes though not sure. Hiking can it get really muddy? Hiking boots seem good but annoying to carry around when not in use. Waterproof shoes I imagine feet will get super hot. Or my usual all rounder shoe is my hiking trainer. It&#x27;s meshed so keeps my feet cool but takes forever to dry usually, and won&#x27;t handle heavy mud/rain well, can combine with waterproof socks. Although if it&#x27;s 30+ degrees maybe they might dry quicker? Or if there&#x27;s any type of fast dry hiking trainer people recommend? Any tips for an would be much appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>Gần 2.000 người mãn hạn tù tại Malaysia về nước trên &#x27;chuyến bay giải cứu&#x27; đã bị nhóm cán bộ ở đại sứ quán thu những khoản tiền trái quy định, cao hơn thực tế. Cựu đại sứ tại Malaysia khai đã chia số tiền thu thừa theo tỉ lệ chức vụ của các cán bộ.

 Hôm nay (14-7), phiên tòa xét xử vụ án &quot;chuyến bay giải cứu&quot; tiếp tục phần thẩm vấn để làm rõ hành vi đưa, nhận hối lộ của các cựu quan chức.
 Lời khai tại tòa những ngày qua cho thấy trong đại dịch các bị cáo là quan chức của nhiều bộ ngành ở trong nước nhận hối lộ của các doanh nghiệp để cấp phép &quot;chuyến bay giải cứu&quot;.
 Còn ở ngoài nước, một nhóm bị cáo là cựu cán bộ ngoại giao nhận &quot;bôi trơn&quot; theo kiểu đếm đầu người, thậm chí thu tiền thừa của các công dân mãn hạn tù về nước rồi &quot;ăn chia&quot;.
 Chia tiền theo tỉ lệ chức vụ của các cán bộ
 Ông Trần Việt Thái khai được bổ nhiệm đại sứ đặc mệnh toàn quyền tại Malaysia từ tháng 5-2020. Ông là người chịu trách nhiệm chính trong việc tổ chức các &quot;chuyến bay giải cứu&quot; đưa công dân Việt Nam ở Malaysia về nước khi dịch COVID-19.
 Đại sứ quán Việt Nam tại Malaysia đã tổ chức 21 chuyến bay đưa công dân về nước, trong đó có 8 chuyến bay đưa 1.891 người đã chấp hành xong án phạt tù về nước.
 Ông Thái cho biết để tổ chức các &quot;chuyến bay giải cứu&quot; đưa người mãn hạn tù về, ông đã chỉ đạo Nguyễn Hoàng Linh và Lê Ngọc Anh (cán bộ đại sứ) đi khảo sát tại các trại chờ để xây dựng kế hoạch, phương án và đề xuất kinh phí các mức thu, chi.

                              <span>My friend and I fell victim to a new strategy that they use to save money. Our flight was scheduled for 8:35am and upon arrival at 6:15, they apparently cancelled the flight and that it was at 6:25am. Which means that we were too late to check in. Our travel agent checked on her end and says it still showed the original details. 
 Consequences: we miss the first flight, schedule a last minute flight with a different carrier, eventually missing the second leg of the flight because of the delays. Total cost is 260+160+90USD to get to where I need to be. 
 Their reasoning: they provided ample notification so they were not liable for us checking in “late”. No refund. For the second leg, our flight was within 3 hrs of the next leg “according go policy”. They pulled up the relevant article on their website. No refund.

                              <span>Just came back from a summer trip to the US and the washer and dryers are just superior to anything I’ve used here in Vietnam. I have an Electrolux washing machine and it takes forever to do a load and doesn’t clean soiled articles well. And a Candy brand dryer which doesn’t dry by air but by heating the drum and evaporating the water. Also takes forever to dry clothes/ blankets. 
 Does anyone know of any options in Vietnam for washer and dryers that are similar to what you would find in the US?

                              <span>I have been watching the series of videos about this recent fire on youtube. The first video shows the fire already established and locals rushing to save their livelihoods. There is one particularly sad scene where a man and his son rush to the fire carrying bowls of water. The man, intent on not spilling the water, finally pauses and looks up at what confronts him. You can see the despair in his eyes; the exact moment when he gives up against the impossible odds against him. Locals rush to and fro, helping set up the fire hoses, rushing in to battle the flames in any way they can, mostly getting in the way.
 The second video is of the aftermath. OP chats with one of the boat owners (I think, I have no Vietnamese unfortunately). What strikes me is the seeming lack of anger or sadness. It …</span>

                              <span>I’m french born vietnamese and l’m planning to move to vietnam (with my boyfriend) because my mother is living there. I can speak and write in vietnamese and french fluently so I think is a plus for me to find a job there but what scare me the most is the work field that i’m actually in. I’m working in printing industry and from what I saw, the market is really saturated there (too much small and middle size company) and my profile is not that exceptional to compete with someone with the same skill but cheaper. So what kind of arguments can I give to recruiters to convince them to hire me ?

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I&#x27;ll (34M) be in Da Nang the second half of October and deciding which area to stay in. Trying to avoid overly touristy areas. I&#x27;d prefer to bike/walk to most places and to stay close-ish to the beach. But, if there&#x27;s a &quot;better&quot; place to stay further from the beach, I&#x27;m open to it. Priorities are proximity to (mostly) non-western restaurants, bars, coffee shops, historical sites—you get it.
 My biggest priority though is meeting people. I&#x27;d really like to meet some locals and travelers at bars, non-western restaurants, meet-ups—wherever. I have a bad habit of exploring cities by myself and am actively trying to change that. Looking to meet people and have a good time, but not necessarily party/go to clubs. I heard Oi Bar was a good place to start. Any and all recommendations are appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>I am born in France with all my family being french, apart from my mother who is half french half Vietnamese, the mothers side having fought the french and her fathers side having fought and most probably in charge of various atrocities. 
 Since this sub seems open to a lot of various questions from all different sorts of people I wanted to have your opinion and thought about how french Vietnamese people are seen/treated in VN and how you feel as someone with a similar background. But this question originally came to me when I thought to myself
 &quot;Will I be seen with any disdain or ill treated if I am found out to be french when I eventually decide to go to VN?&quot;
 (I look very much European, but would be capable of hiding the fact that I am french as long as my passport in not required) I meant this with every ounce of respect. Thank you very much in advance. Bon jours de la Bastille en passant!

 I inherited this box from my (Eastgerman/GDR) grandmother. Who told me once this was from a friend in Vietnam? Can you help you me decipher what is being written here and/or what is displayed? 
 It is obviously a war scene with the airplanes and paratroopers in the background?
 Hope this is an appropriate request for this sub.

 As is well known, Vietnam and China had a war in the 1970s，China calls this war a self-defense and counterattack war.【I would like to make a statement first that I support Vietnam.】
 According to the Chinese, the cause of this war is the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese have made mistakes, and the Chinese should teach the Vietnamese a lesson
 But in reality, it was Deng xiaoping who joined NATO, and this war was a show for the Americans

                              <span>Đà Nẵng got their first McDonald’s and people are up in arms about it. Would you try it for a taste of home? Or do you think it’s not worth the money? 
 Personally, I haven’t had McDonald’s in the past 3 years I’ve lived here, so I had to try it once just to remember how equally shit/delicious it was.

                              <span>It&#x27;s an often overlooked event of colonialism in Vietnam. Even in VN&#x27;s history lesson the teachers only talked briefly about it and not much is discussed about them at all here. Japan is well-known if their brutality in WW2 - often surpassed in the French in terms of exploitation and cruelty. Yet, most VN seems to have forgotten about them
 What&#x27;s your take?

                              <span>It was for survival.
 &quot;North Vietnam&#x27;s victory made the entire nation poor and undeveloped.&quot; is what the extreme anti-communists keep saying. To be honest, when the US army came to Vietnam with the intention of destroying the Vietnamese, thinking about your wealth seems luxurious.
 Here is the list of 33 massacres I found that were perpetrated by the US, the RoV and the South Korean armies.

 The Vietnamese fought simply to save their families and their own lives. If the enemies are going to kill you, what&#x27;s the point worrying about money?

                              <span>Hey I&#x27;m trying to see people&#x27;s opinion on this guy, Ive been watching his stuff now and then, knew him through his brother (an icon in vietnamese esports scene), I watched him go from a standup comedian to now doing mostly controversial videos. Most internet users in Vietnam arent that well educated, these people usually comment &quot;reactionary&quot; under his video or just casually insult him because of his disability. Now, personally, I partially agree with what he&#x27;s saying in his videos and I feel great that someone living in a society like Vietnam is brave enough to put out their different views, actively pointing out social, cultural flaws of the system (sometimes exaggerated though). I may be pretentious here but I consider myself a better than average young vietnamese person in terms of education, understanding of freedom of speech and open-mindedness, it would have been nice to have some meaningful polite conversations about his videos but as of right now, Vietnam is not at that level yet.

 Widespread accounts of sexual assault also exist, with some studies estimating that up to 10,000 Vietnamese women and girls were raped by South Korean soldiers.
 Korean forces are alleged to have perpetrated the Binh Tai, Bình An/Tây Vinh, Bình Hòa, and Hà My massacres

                              <span>I have a rescued dog, 8.5 kg (corgi mix). I have the weekends off, so somewhere close by is ideal. Preferably somewhere inexpensive, just want to relax and get my mind off for a day or two. Are locals open to couch surfing?

                              <span>As an American, we hear so much about the veterans of the Vietnam war facing PTSD, housing instability, prejudice etc. I’m curious about what life was/is like for the Vietnamese men and women who were involved, especially whether they experienced PTSD or something similar.
 Are there any books, films, interviews about what they had to go through? Anyone with anecdotes from friends or family members that you’d be willing to share?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 Need honest and straight forward advice please.
 My girlfriend is Vietnamese, and I am looking to settle in Vietnam as my girlfriend don&#x27;t want to move overseas. I currently visit Vietnam every 2nd month on tourist visa.
 I don&#x27;t want to marry her just to buy a property sooner so looking for ways to find a property. I want to marry her at the right time and for good reasons.
 - Searching online doesn&#x27;t help as I have only been finding properties in USD
 - I will happily buy property together with her as long as it&#x27;s in both of our names and not just one name only
 If anyone can provide any guidance - I have simply read that foreigners can buy property in new projects/developments but that doesn&#x27;t help much as all the properties advertised in English seems to be spiked in price in USD.
 Would prefer property price of up to 1.8 billion VND and if I/we can get a home loan too, that would be absolutely perfect

And to be honest, I think we should cooperate more closely as long as have common enemies like North Korea and especially China. Vietnamese friends, what about you?

                              <span>My wife’s iphone was stolen from the old quarter in Hanoi. This happened a block or two away from the water puppet theater. The thief took great advantage of us being vulnerable as it was raining, we were trying to manage our two kids and looking for a place to eat. Find my iPhone located it near a pawn shop 3 kms away from where we were. We were so tired and frustrated from our trip + the hotel staff advised us that there is no point pursuing the phone or the police. Later, a shop owner told us to w should have gone to the police and they might have been able to help. Whatever. Now we are back in our country. It is what it is but as much as I don’t want it does affect our emotions and feelings towards Hanoi and touristy areas. This can happen in many places and in many countries but still when it happens to one personally, it’s hard to not be biased. We had overall pretty good time in Vietnam, esp in Saigon and DaNang.
 Have things like this happened to any of you?

                              <span>My family is in HCM for 2 weeks and my little sister is bored to death with the sight-seeing and stressful shopping at big marketplaces. We found a cute stationary/gift shop called Ốc Sên Shop that she absolutely LOVED and a cat cafe that featured rescue cats which she stayed hours at. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations of activities or shops that are similar? We stopped by Rách Gia earlier last week and found a boutique called Barbie House which she also expressed interest in. So I guess any cute gift shops / clothing boutiques / fun activities around here that would interest a late teens sister. 
 Thanks in advance!!

 In my culture this is not really a thing, and we don&#x27;t usually bring gifts... but I know it&#x27;s common in southeast Asian culture and I don&#x27;t want to offend anyone.
 My gf is telling me I don&#x27;t have to bring anything, but her sisters Vietnamese boyfriends all brought some food or alcohol the first time they visited her family according to her lol.
 I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for several months now and known my gf for over a year.
 Any help/advice is appreciated:)

 I was just focused on developing my career and achieving &#x27;white people&#x27; success in mum and dad&#x27;s eyes I didn&#x27;t really put in the effort to connect ... I came by this track recently and it got me in the feels: 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jwJKjRfhTxA
 Does anyone feel like they could have put in more effort into learning Vietnamese to connect with family members now that we&#x27;re older (25 and up) ... sometimes I feel bad about this 😕

                              <span>I&#x27;m soon going to Vietnam to visit a friend, but I want to bring something special for his mother...an older woman in her late 60&#x27;s, little schooling, who has spent much of her life working in the rice fields. Any interesting suggestions...something that might not take up too much room on a carry on bag? What might she appreciate and/or actually use? Maybe it would be better to find something in Vietnam for her that would be appropriate?

                              <span>When you go to a Vietnamese restaurant do you stand at the door and wait to be seated or do you just go in and sit wherever you like?
 In the US we always wait to be seated unless there is a sign that says &quot;seat yourself&quot;.
 I&#x27;m a bit awkward so I don&#x27;t want to just stand at the door like a moron waiting to be seated if I&#x27;m supposed to just seat myself anywhere.

                              <span>Currently, all over the world are having a headache about the problem of underground pollution. The cause is caused by human production activities such as the use of chemical drugs into the ground too much.Causing the phenomenon of barren land cannot be reused and that land becomes dead land. With the current population growth, the food problem is also a major problem, if the land cannot be reused, it will cause food shortage problems, and may also cause groundwater pollution in the underground.

 I hope you&#x27;re well.
 I&#x27;m going to be in Vietnam for a few weeks in August and I was thinking of catching a train in a direction, for the experience of having done it. 
 But I find myself stuck on which direction to go! I&#x27;m thinking of Hà Nội to Đà Nẵng or the other way around. What do you think?

                              <span>HI, I need an app to link a foreign card to it and make payments cashless payments, such as sending money from my foreign bank card to Vietnamese nationals&#x27; bank accounts.
 Asked some wallets such as Momo and Vnpay, they support only Vietnamese cards.
 Tried Paypal the fee is ~34% (took 0.34$ from 1.00$ test payment, also put the amount on hold for the reciever), so I&#x27;m looking for cheaper options.

                              <span>Hello friends
 I will be visiting Hanoi in September. I am looking to book a cruise to Halong Bay. I can see that there are loads of cruise operators and website advertising this. How do we check if they are legit, and what scams should we look out for? The reason why I am asking and abit weary is when I booked my hotel, my phone has been getting messages non stop from the hotel, telling us to book a tour with them instead and warning of scams from other operators.
 I am interested in this tour company is anybody able to tell me if it’s legit?
 https://www.cruisehalongbay.com
 I have attached some screenshots about some registration number that this business posses.
 Thank you very much!

                              <span>I am traveling in vietnam for the first time and I am overwhelmed by the country, the people and their warmth and friendliness and the food. Now I was a few nights in a cute homestay. I wanted to extend this by one night, but I could not, because the room has already been booked again. Now they have offered me a small apartment, which I gratefully accepted. I was brought there by a friend of the owner with the motorcycle (about 10 minutes drive). When I asked her how much I should pay for the ride, she replied that she wanted nothing. Tomorrow I will leave this apartment again. Now my question to you: should I leave her the money for the ride tomorrow or just a small tip for the apartment? If so, how much would be appropriate? Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Every time when the yearly mass military recruitment wave is approaching, people would bring up this topic to debate but after 1 or 2 weeks it&#x27;d fade away. Supposedly it&#x27;s a major reason for people to bribe out of the service and funny enough it&#x27;s actually easy to avoid the mandatory calling.

                              <span>What do you recommend as bank for foreigners that can do money transfers to international accounts via their online platform? Because I&#x27;m so done with HSBC.
 I&#x27;ve been with HSBC for 4 years now for my salary account and their customer service is utterly disgusting. After 4 calls, 12 emails and a visit to the bank, they still aren&#x27;t able to address my concern. My credit card will be blocked two days from now, and I had submitted all the documents 2 weeks before, but they still aren&#x27;t processing it. All the email replies are canned templates and calling their hotlines cost a lot because it&#x27;s just recorded music. The customer service representatives are clueless and they just keep repeating what is written on the website, and not answering my questions. It&#x27;s so tiring to talk with them.
 No wonder they have mostly 1 star reviews on Google. All 206 reviews averaged to 1.7. What a joke for an &quot;international&quot; bank.
 I&#x27;m checking Citibank and Shinhan Bank, what do you guys recommend?

                              <span>Hi all! 
 First time travelling to Vietnam. My partner and I are currently in Hanoi and loving it. We are heading on down to Ho Chi Minh in a couple of weeks. It&#x27;ll be my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday when we are there and i really want to give her a special day.
 Any recommendations on things to do, restaurants to eat at (shes vegetarian btw) etc etc ??
 Staying in District 1 so preferably walking distance or not too far from this
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, for few months back i started to grow some passions about cinema, and i would like to go for University of Theater and Cinema, but since the date to apply already concluded.
 I have a dream to become a small director, to do a small project, some short films about my life or making a big one with the size compare to cinema. I wanted to brought our country&#x27;s film to a next level, maybe everyone are also like me, but i feel it.
 In Ho Chi Minh, is there any training center or other College i can learn to be one, from the techniques to using cameras, edits,... So i can know the details in every part once i making the film, now i&#x27;m already starting to develop some scripts which i think it could tell something, might just a crap but it is what i love.
 I can&#x27;t thank you enough for this

                              <span>I remember when I was a kid my mom had to bring USD cash to bribe airport authorities to not steal our stuff and let us into the country.
 I heard this was common for ppl who are Vietnamese and entering into the country. 
 Is this still normal? If so, how much cash should I bring?

                              <span>My boyfriend is in Vietnam with a group of guy friends and I saw a reddit post saying if you go clubbing with a group of guys, the girls that work there will accompany them. Is this true? How does it work? I trust my boyfriend but I don’t trust the strangers that could possibly spike his drink and I’m uncomfortable about the fact that they’ll have sexy women keeping him company.

Is there a Vietnamese word to refer to the current counter-culture? (I.e. tattoo, graffiti, dark music, extreme art etc) thanks 😇

I was born in USA and am currently traveling Vietnam from north to south solo without any restrictions and bias opinions from my family to have fun and explore my roots.
 My family escaped from Saigon to USA. They tried their best to give me a Vietnamese upbringing. I remember that it was going well. I started to hang out with my cousins who were born in Vietnam and came over to USA when I was in elementary school. I was bullied by how I spoke in Vietnamese and never felt fully welcomed by them. I moved away from an Asian community in middle school and was bullied for being Asian. There were few Asian people but they somehow fit in with the white or black crowd. I mo…</span>

                              <span>Vietnam is in my bucket list for a long time. This big country cannot be explode in 7 days so I have decided that I will travel and in between I have to work. 1. If I take a tourist sim card with 5G is it enough to connect my laptop and work ? Mostly IT work in Google Chrome and some software. No video upload etc. 2. Which sim card to take for this 30 day plan ? 3. I see lot of buses operate in cities. Are these AC buses, operate on time ? (Or like Indian buses. No schedule). 4. For travel between cities how early I need to book train/bus ticket ? Which website can I use to book ? 5. Any concern on snatching/pickpocketing? 6. My plan is saigon - DMZ - da nang/hoi an / hue - Hanoi - ninh bin - cat ba island. Is it ok or shall I add something? Exit from Hanoi airport. Max I can spend 3 to 4 weeks. In between I have to work full days :( 7. I don&#x27;t speak vietnemese at all. Will there be issue with ordering food with street food vendor? Thanks.

                              <span>Da Nang has been showing me so many new things. Around ~9-9:15pm on Cầu Rồng, there was a bunch of motorbikes speeding (like i have never seen vehicles go this fast in Vietnam&#x27;s big cities) down the bridge with guys on the back whipping belts out. Eventually, one guy is on the ground with his bike knocked down, getting beaten with belts. The perps take off, leaving the guy curled up in fetal position. This all happened in the middle of moving traffic.
 I guess....WTF??? I&#x27;m assuming this is a one-off but seems very bold to be doing it so publicly.

                              <span>As the title says, I&#x27;m looking for some interesting documentaries to learn more about the country and culture. Unfortunately mostly when searching the only ones that come up are war related, for which I have no interest in rehashing. Ideally I&#x27;d like to find content thats more in depth on the culture, not just random tourism focused stuff.
 Any recommendations would be appreciated. Likewise if there are any better news/current affairs publications beyond VNexpress/TuoiTre that would also be great.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about this statement. None of my Vietnamese friends have been able to give me a concrete answer yet...
 Why is it that every conversation I have with older folks here (male or female) seems to go in the exact same direction? How long you been here? What is your job? How old are you? Are you married? NO?! Then they insist I marry a Vietnamese woman.
 Sometimes it&#x27;s a quick, lighthearted suggestion but then other times it&#x27;s a full on sales pitch. One old man told me that he likes the look of western women, but they don&#x27;t age well like Vietnamese women do so I best take up a Vietnamese wife... which I found very funny. 
 So why do you guys think this happens? People seem so passionate about suggesting it to me

                              <span>I am aware of the fact that this is a common problem among every community but it seems really ridiculous in Vietnam. Whenever I play a game, I often stumble upon Vietnamese with hard swears as their username, and they&#x27;re often pretty toxic. I was playing this game about tanks, we lost the match because a guy on our team was afk. I notified the enemy team of his position and that&#x27;s when this guy, with the most original username ever, (Ditmemay12) starts to unleash his tantrum on me. He told me to shut up, I&#x27;m like what? The afk guy was the only one left on our team so I wanted to get this over with. What was he trying to do? Show his typing skills? Show how much of a failure he has become? (Btw the guy sucks at the game). It&#x27;s not the first time I have seen such behaviours, it&#x27;s everywhere. On Facebook, Discord, etc. Any social media platform that has Vietnamese. Again, I know it&#x27;s a common problem and those people does not represent the entirety of he Vietnamese community. But I feel like those kinds of people take up a hefty percentage of the community. Have anyone gotten the same experience as me?

                              <span>We have been staying in Hanoi for a week already and we are staying the next three weeks. We’ve been getting by using google translate and common sense and so far he’s tried a wide variety of Vietnamese food without a reaction. Seems like a lot of food uses soy oil so far. He carries epi pens with him.
 However, people are often confused by the translated message and we think it’s not clear. 
 Using google translate from English to viet to English, “no nuts, no sesame” returns as “no seeds. Unseasoned” which isn’t helpful at all hahaha.
 Also nuts can translate to peanuts but he is allergic to all nuts and nut oils. Sesame also seems to have multiple translations.
 A translation of something like “I can’t eat nuts, nut oils, sesame, sesame oil. Does this food contain them?” would be ideal! :D 
 thank you for any help!!
 Edit If you’re interested hes only eating a small bite of food then waiting 5-10 mins for a reaction to be safe. if he reacted he would make himself throw it up. He also has tablets and 4 epi pens. He’s also a med student.

 I&#x27;m planning on flying into Ho Chi Minh city, spending a couple of nights, then I want to make the trek up to Hanoi. Does anyone have suggestions on how to do this, and what the most interesting path might be? Also is it safe to travel alone or are there some sketchy parts I should avoid?
 Ideally I&#x27;d love to rent a motorcycle and ride up myself... but I&#x27;ve never ridden a motorcycle or driven in Asia so scratch that idea. Is there some kind of boat I can take, or something? I&#x27;d love to make my way up to Hanoi over the course of 5-6 days and see as much of Vietnam as I can.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

                              <span>Hello guys, I am planning trip to Vietnam for 2024. The best time would be sometime between january to march, but there is also lunar year at 10th feb and I heard there is nothing todo by that time and everything is more expensive. Is that true? Is it better to come after Lunar Year? Anyway I was also googling something about Vietnam Craft Beer and beer festivals. I found something but doesn’t give much info really. Is there something like that? Could you tell me more about craft beer in Vietnam please? Thank you

                              <span>Hello! I’m here with my Vietnamese boyfriend and his family.
 I’ve been looking a little at clothes and everything is for skinny people, is there any stores in Saigon you could recommend for bigger girls?
 Fells weird saying I’m “bigger” when I’m normal sized in my own country, but I do understand the Asian standards of being skinny.

 I&#x27;m a major fan of Vietnamese food, but this will be my first time visiting Vietnam. Are there any specific dishes that you would recommend for me to try out? The more local, the better!

                              <span>Probably one of the best buffet in Hanoi I&#x27;ve ever tried and visited
 Heartwarming and very considerate staff Price is roughly 400k ₫ per person
 I&#x27;m saying this because I&#x27;ve tried over 35+ well known buffets in Vietnam (saigon, da nang, nha trang... etc) and this buffet hits the spot. 
 Just my 2cents of course. Ps: not a commissioner but a foodie influencer on ig from america

 95% of the girls working those “booking” scams work for this group. 
 You’re welcome lol.
 These girls ought to be named and shamed on Facebook frankly. Nothing wrong with working as a club promoter but lying about it to pull guys into astronomically priced mafia dens and have their “friends” join your tab is a step too far.

                              <span>I come from a 3rd world country with not much allowance for this trip but I would like to bring home some souvenirs. I’d probably buy snacks to share or kitschy stuff for close friends. My mom wants me to buy a bag for her too😭 Any good recommendations for Ben Thahn stores or Vietnamese snacks to bring home? Or is there a better place to buy these rather than Ben Thahn?

 Question: Are there any lounges you would recommend in Terminal 2 of Hanoi airport? Would you pay when you arrive or book in advance?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My (23 F) boyfriend (23 M) is from HCM city and moved to America one year ago. We’ve been dating for over six months and the relationship has gotten serious.
 I love him (surprisingly, his family also loves me) and it’s looking like things might end in marriage down the line. I’m amazed they accept me so easily when my family doesn’t accept him, but I try my best anyway. His family wants everyone to live together someday soon. My boyfriend says no.
 My boyfriend has a rebellious spirit. His cousin bought me VN government-issued textbooks to study the language, but he doesn’t want to teach me Vietnamese manners. It leads to awkward situations with his family A LOT. He says “just be yourself, it’s America!” but I want his family’s approval.
 His parents were very poor in VN and are very traditional. My family is rich and has more advanced manners than average Americans. I grew up with my grandparents too, so I act and dress more like an older lady. It’s funny because sometimes I act like a polite American to his parents and they say to my boyfriend “she has Vietnamese manners, nice”. I’m totally uneducated but I know I offend them a little sometimes. 
 For example, he didn’t tell me I should offer his parents to eat before I eat their food. Things like that. 
 Please, if anyone has information on how not to offend Vietnamese parents, tell me. I never dress provocatively or curse, and I try to be as helpful as possible in the kitchen. My boyfriend’s family gives me a lot of patience as a westerner, but I want to do the right thing.
 Thank you 💗

                              <span>TLDR: just another diaspora’s thought. 
 For context, I am 100% local. Vietnamese I mean. I just left Vietnam last year for my study, after 32 years living in the country, Ho Chi Minh City to be specific. I had always felt “un-belonged” before whilst living in HCMC, and the biggest reason is because. I am very independent, in almost everything, mentality, finance, living style etc. I own what I say, and do. I have a big extended family with 10 uncles and aunties, and a small immediate family with a single mom and a big older brother (we are 18 years old apart). I grew up without a father, and he’s around somewhere in this country, just not around in any form. My family is very respectful, and I am very proud of them. My mother is a strong woman who went through a lot of things to raise me …</span>

Đến bây giờ cậu ấy tán lại tớ khi cả 2 đã đủ lớn hơn (20 tuổi), cậu ấy rất tốt, chủ động nữa, cộng thêm việc tớ thấy tội lỗi khi hồi ấy ko đáp lại cậu ấy, nói sao nhỉ, tớ cảm thấy tình cảm tớ không đủ lớn để có thể trở thành người yêu. Cậu ấy từng nói với tớ là “ nếu lần này ko thành công thì chắc sau này ko dám yêu ai nữa mất” nên tớ thấy tội lỗi lắm. Tớ không biết có nên nuôi lớn tình cảm này không, hay là nên kết thúc luôn nữa 😭😭

                              <span>Really embarrassed to talk about this. I’m not looking for sympathy. I just wanted to warn other travellers about this.
 I’m a foreigner from London. Have been using a dating app here. I noticed there are some girls on the app who are very eager to meet right away and go for a drink. Stupidly, I agreed to go with one this evening.
 She told me to meet her around the corner from Sniff club. Met her, looked nothing like her photos (which hardly showed her face anyway). She led us to this club.
 She didn’t even speak English and we communicated via google translate…
 She said she wanted to drink champagne 🤦🏼‍♂️ so I bought a bottle. Then she asked if she can do some balloons, and kept asking for more and more. At one point she suggested I tip the bar staff. 
 She was super flirty and touching me all over. Until I said no to more balloons she acted like a grumpy child.
 I noticed some girls who were waiting on the corner, who later on were in the same club with some foreigner men.
 I am quite sure these girls are employed by the club to get men to come in and spend money. My total bill was 5 million…
 It’s a sad feeling to be taken advantage of like this. Everyone I’ve met so far has been so kind and generous to me.
 So yea, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is!

                              <span>My mom has very little teeth left. She wants to get partial dentures when she go back to Vietnam next year because of the affordable cost. 
 She has the money to get them done in the US but refuses because she wants to save money.
 My extended family is advising her to get them done in the US to avoid complications and is pressuring me to convince her. They said the dentists in Vietnam are incompetent and that if she were to have issues with the dentures, she will have to get them redo in the States which will cost even more money. 
 I understand both sides of the argument. I’m unsure what to tell my mom 
 Can you guys share your thoughts on this matter?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m currently exploring to find a new long-term home in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve been living in the Philippines for 6+ years, and one year in Indonesia, so I&#x27;m used to some of the pros &amp; cons of living in SEA like:
  
Natural disasters (PH has tons of typhoons, ID has lots of earthquakes although tbh I hardly notice those)
 Shit politics that drive you insane
 Expensive X (in PH food is overpriced AF, in Indonesia, electronic are overpriced AF)
 Terrible commute to the office if you can&#x27;t walk it
  
Hardly anything shocks me. I just go with the flow and accept the bad stuff or ignore it when possible.
 BUT of course, some things can be dealbreakers.
 I&#x27;m not in PH right now only because I lost my home in the Philippines during COVID and at this point, I&#x27;m not too sure to go back. It&#x27;s a long and …</span>

                              <span>Just curious, it might become a reality, and Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, and Vietnam fall along a line in the ocean that would become a war zone.
 Edit: that line of US/National bases extends from South Korea to Singapore/Malaysia. 
 There’s also a treaty in Thailand up until about 2045 iirc.

                              <span>I’ve heard that foreigner men attract lots of Vietnamese women. Do female foreigners also attract lots of Vietnamese men for long term relationships? Is it a turn off if the women make a lot more then the men (due to having an expat salary)?
 Curious to hear your opinions!
 Ps: what about Western asian women?

                              <span>In a particular marketing team, there is a supervisor who holds the same number of years of work experience as the other team members but demonstrates less competence. It is evident to everyone in the office that the supervisor is the CEO&#x27;s favorite employee. Whenever the CEO makes an insensitive joke, if the supervisor reacts poorly, the CEO apologizes. However, if anyone else in the team reacts negatively, the CEO calls them out, expressing dissatisfaction with their response.
 Interestingly, it was the supervisor who recently fired a colleague, but the CEO publicly supported the decision, attributing it to himself. This situation suggests that the CEO is protecting the supervisor by taking responsibility for the dismissal. This lack of transparency creates an unbalanced power dynamic within the office. After the incident, the office became dull.
 Moreover, the supervisor constantly seeks to know what others are doing, including questioning their work methods. This behavior can be bothersome, especially when team members are competent and experienced. For instance, one team member was surprised when the supervisor asked for assistance with a basic marketing task, such as scheduling social media posts. It is disconcerting when someone in an executive role lacks knowledge of fundamental marketing tools.
 These observations raise my concerns about power dynamics within the team. The supervisor appears to be favored, even with her limited competence, while others are held to a different standard. Additionally, the CEO&#x27;s protection of the supervisor and the supervisor&#x27;s micromanagement tendencies suggest an abuse of power.

 I’m flying to Tokyo on Monday and I found a good deal on vietjet that departs at 11:20pm from HCMC. 
 Is this airline reliable? I don’t want to show up and it 4 hours late or cancelled altogether. Does anyone have any experience flying this airline?
 Thanks.

 Are there any other verbs that have a seperate word which refers to the same action but in a different tense?

                              <span>My wife’s family is Vietnamese. When we play blackjack with her family and coworkers, they play a version where the Ace card can equal 1, 10, or 11. I’m American and the only way I’ve seen this game played prior is with an Ace being valued only as either 1 or 11. Is this normally how Vietnamese play or do they have their own rules for the game? I’d appreciate any feedback.

I can’t sleep and have woken up several times, and everytime i wake up its because of noise from the outside. Every fucking time, it’s just karaoke noise. Those men whining and “singing”. This also happened in the afternoon when they sing for the fucking NEIGHBORHOOD. I feel cold ans my head aches. Why do people love karaoke so much? don’t they have any human decency? Don’t they think about the consequences of their action?

                              <span>I would like to move to Vietnam and I was wondering if anyone had an idea of the salary there for a lawyer working for one of the Big 4? I want to know how I should negociate my salary and what expectations to have. 
 Last time I went, I met a “project manager” in a construction company, and he said he was making $6000USD/month. Is that reasonable to think that I could make close to this kind of salary?

                              <span>So i found this website that shows you the freedom rating of countries around the world, and you cant even access it without a VPN if youre in Vietnam which is already a major red flag. When i go to check what our rating is its 19/100 for global freedom and 22/100 for internet freedom which is way way worse than i had original thought (Though i can’t guarantee if the data is correct or not). I want to hear about your experiences living here and about how correct that is.
 P.S the website is called Freedom House

                              <span>I know i probably shouldn&#x27;t be asking the internet, but I&#x27;m currently in Vietnam and this has become a recent problem. Two days ago i woke up with this mark after sleeping in a hotel room in Vietnam (Nortern region). I didn&#x27;t notice it until i saw it in the mirror but now it has become more irritated (probably because of the friction with my clothes). I don&#x27;t know how i got it, what it is and how to take care of it. It&#x27;s on my ribcage and is about 3 cm in hight, the redness has spread over time.
 First two pictures are current, third is what it looked like in the beginning.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I notice that many businesses in Vietnam use Facebook as their &quot;only&quot; web presence. And either Facebook Messenger, Zalo, or Telegram as the &quot;only &quot; chat app to allow their prospective clients to reach them.
 If you don&#x27;t have an active facebook account, you can&#x27;t view their content freely. Facebook would keep on pestering you to login. ( I regularly face this problem. )
 Many businesses have websites, but instead of a regular inbuilt chat feature, there would be either Facebook Messenger, Zalo or Telegram. If you don&#x27;t have one of these apps ; you can&#x27;t contact them. ( My personal experience for 3 years) 
 Does it ever occur to them that how many businesses they lose because of this limitation? Why not give multiple options to their clients? Why force them to download a new chat app?

                              <span>Covid-19 and a daunting wall China erected along its southern border forced a virtual halt to the trafficking of Vietnamese girls and women into China, many of them for forced marriages with Chinese men. Now, signs are emerging that such trafficking has resumed.

                              <span>The karst formations in PH and TH are very similar to those in Ha Long Bay but the water seems much clearer and nice to swim in. Would it still be worth seeing Ha Long Bay after I’ve been to those places? I’ve heard the water is polluted and not swimmable. Should I spend my time seeing other part of VN? Thanks

                              <span>Hey guys… weird request/question, does anybody here have a SIM card that works in Vietnam. I’ve recently built my own computer and wanted to play crossfire like I did when I was in Vietnam, however the system requires me to text the automated sms system to confirm the account. I don’t live in Vietnam anymore and can’t figure out a way to do it online( all free websites only allow to send full number). Could I use your number to do it lol? 😅

 I&#x27;ll be arriving in Danang a bit late (9:30pm). Does anyone know if the mobile SIM card kiosks will still be open? I&#x27;ll be arriving from abroad and will need to hail a Grab to my hotel...so I&#x27;ll need data to do that.
 If not available, is there wifi in the airport?
 Thanks.

 I just got back and feel like some of my favorite places have gone downhill

 I&#x27;m planning to visit Vietnam in October. I&#x27;m preparing my trip and I&#x27;ve read plenty of recommendations on Reddit, what do you guys think of this itinerary:
 2 days: Hanoi (arrival)
 3 days tour to Ha Giang Loop Tour
 2 days tour to Halong Bay
 2 days tour to Ninh Binh
 1 day: Hanoi (departure)
 I&#x27;m missing something?
 Thank you.

                              <span>I was recently travelling in Southeast Asia and I was shocked by the behaviour of people (especially Vietnamese) regarding trash and plastic. I saw so many people (young and old) simply throwing their trash onto the street: people eating chips and dropping the bag in the sidewalk, a man putting deodorant and tossing it to the middle of the road, plastic bottles, bags, cans of drinks… basically litter everywhere. 
 This is particularly disturbing in big cities like Hanoi and Saigon, which are apparently developed and everyone has a phone and internet, but no one seems to have environmental awareness about reducing and recycling their waste.
 I can understand that old habits die hard and older people continue doing that, but the younger ones seem to follow that path as well. 
 Also, the amount of plastic is insane. Is there really a need to get a drink in a plastic cup, inside a plastic bag, sealed with a plastic lid and drink it from a plastic straw? Even if you drink it on the spot and not take away, they will still put the plastic lid with a machine. On top of that, after finishing the drink, all that plastic ends up being dumped on the street.
 I’m no environmental “freak” or entitled European, but I’m genuinely curious if this is an issue being addressed by Vietnamese people (in schools, public campaigns) or if they simply don’t care. Has there been any improvement in recent years? Do you think there will be?

                              <span>Xin chào! What are nice spots/mountains for hiking in Vietnam? When I was there a few months ago, I was kinda disappointed. Not by the landscape and nature but rather by the accessibility and availability of tracks. I went hiking near Da Lat and Phan Thiet, which was great, but although the north is a lot more mountainous, they were barely accessible due to dense forests and lack of paths. Sometimes there was &quot;too easy&quot; access, which attracts tourists (e.g., viewpoint in Ninh Binh). Ofc Fansipan is an option but I&#x27;d rather do the tour by myself without a guide, also I heard it&#x27;s quite touristic. Do you have any areas or specific mountains which you would recommend?

                              <span>Hello. I would just make this post into a numbered list because I can&#x27;t organize my thoughts well. I hope someone can help us 🙏
  
My mother was born in Saigon in 1969.
 She was able to get a copy of her birth certificate from the Philippine Statistics Authority but it is illegible.
 We emailed the Philippine Embassy in Hanoi but they said there&#x27;s no report of her birth in the archives.
  
If the Philippine Embassy said her birth has no record, is there really no other way for her to get a legible copy of her birth certificate? The local registry here says she should send her personal documents to Vietnam for the correction of her birth certificate, but would it make sense to do that if her birth really has no record in the archives?

                              <span>Ok. I’m sorry for posting here but need some help. My gf is Vietnamese and I’ve asked her but… well she’s not good at this things (according to her) 
 We’re going from the new ao Tien port to Hanoi airport. I’ve googled my ass off but I can’t really find any buses form anything around that place…
 Any suggestion in what stations to check around the port? I can’t find anything. 
 Thank you. And sorry for worthless post but Im actually struggling.

                              <span>I am looking to replace a portable screen for my travel office equipment. Selection on lazada etc is very limited and weak on specs / details.
 Are there any larger electronics stores that would have such products in stock to check out in person? As an example, this is a model that seems to be generally be sold in Vietnam and I would be glad to pickup https://www.amazon.com/LG-16MR70-ASDU1-Protable-Monitor-Silver/dp/B0BZQJ5SPC
 If I have to resort to an online e-commerce vendor, is it more custom to pay upon delivery or ahead of shipping? Does not having a VN bank account usually make such transaction hard?
 TIA

                              <span>Good Morning All,
 I am an American and I live permanently in Viet Nam with my wife who is Vietnamese.
 I have lived in Viet Nam for 10 years now and we recently moved here to live a more simpler life. However, I&#x27;ve been thinking about opening up my own business as I have extensive experience in my field and I feel quite confident I can make it work well.
 My question is what is the least hassle-free way of doing this. I have zero problem putting the business 100% into my wife&#x27;s name if it means less issues.
 Would this be the recommended course of action? If so, is anyone aware of the fees or capital requirements for a 100% Vietnamese owner versus a foreigner owner? Anything else that might be worth taking into consideration?
 I&#x27;m not trying to shortcut any taxes or anything like that. I have no problem paying my fair share. I&#x27;m just trying to get everything started as cost-effectively as possible.
 Thanks!

                              <span>We will be travelling from Ninh Binh to Hue in October with our 4yo, who is not fully toilet-independent and still needs help on the toilet. 
 The train is of course much more convenient logistically than flying, but I have read so many horror blogs and reviews about cockroaches and absolutely feral toilets and smokers on the train etc. 
 It&#x27;s now 2023 and I am not sure if some of the older reviews still hold. Has anyone done this recently? Should I just go back to Hanoi and fly to Hue and simply suck up the waste of a day? 
 Also, is the &#x27;rainy season&#x27; in Hue/Hoi An in mid-October absolutely awful or usually ok for tourist activities? We booked international flight from Danang before checking weather so we are pretty much stuck with going to central area. Thanks in advance for any help.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My Vietnamese girlfriend&#x27;s mom was recently admitted into the hospital for some health issues. I would like to get her Get Well flowers.
 In the past I messed up by getting white flowers for my gf on Valentine&#x27;s days. Supposedly her mom was not happy about it being white, because white is suppose to be used during a passing.
 What would be an appropriate color for flowers for this occasion?
 Appreciate the help!

                              <span>Whether it&#x27;s live music in a cafe or huge outdoor televised productions, it&#x27;s always the same format. An anonymous band and one or two lead singers.

Có một hôm mất điện, bà ta đành phải thắp nến lên cho sáng. Một lúc sau, có tiếng người gõ cửa. Bà ra mở cửa, thì ra đó là con của nhà hàng xóm. Đứa bé nghiêm túc hỏi: “Con chào dì, dì cho con hỏi nhà dì có nến không ạ?”. Bà ta thầm nghĩ: “Cái gia đình này nghèo đến nỗi ngay cả nến cũng không có sao? Tốt nhất không cho, cứ như thế họ sẽ ỷ lại mất”.
 Nghĩ rồi, bà liền nói to một tiếng: “Không có!”. Đúng lúc bà ta đang chuẩn bị đóng cửa, đứa bé đó liền cười rạng rỡ và nói: “Con thừa biết là nhà dì không có nến mà!”. Nói xong, đứa bé liền lấy ra hai cây nến: “Mẹ và con sợ dì sống một mình không có nến nên con đem sang tặng dì hai cái để thắp sáng ạ!”. Lúc này, bà ta vừa tự trách bản thân, vừa cảm động rơi nước mắt, sau đó liền ôm chặt đứa bé vào lòng.

                              <span>Out of curiosity, from those who have experienced any of these how effective does everyone think these following traditions are?: - Wind snatching (Dật gió) - Wind scraping (Cạo gió) - Cupping (Giác hơi) - Acupressure (Bấm Huyệt) - Bloodletting (Cắt llể)
 Do they actually help with what they intend to do (e.g reduce pain/stiffness, cure diseases, improve skin or health etc.) or are they mainly placebo from your experience?
 Context if you’re curious: I’ve lived in Australia my whole life and an currently in Vietnam to visit family after a long time. My family is very insistent on using traditional medicine techniques to improve my skin. They took me to a doctor who put small cuts on my skin all over my body, and when I searched this up I got the term ‘Cắt llể’ for bloodletting. They’ve been doing this almost more than weekly and they say that it’s getting all the bad blood out. In my opinion it’s a real pain and honestly I doubt it’s doing anything. But maybe it works for others?
 I’ve been provided wind scraping before with my family using the green eagle medicine and they said that the redder it is the more sick I am. It’s probably very red because of how hard they scrape it into my skin! It definitely helps warm you up though.
 I’m just wondering how this all is for both people who have lived in vietnam and how normal it all is. Thank you!

                              <span>For a lot of us in the west, when we feel disillusioned with the way the world is going, we take positions against our government, take up anti-establishment slogans and listen to anti-establishment music. Fashion, music and art styles are born from opposition to cultural norms and government direction.
 How do people in Vietnam (and I suppose other one-party, unitary countries) express their dissatisfaction with contemporary culture without being political about it? Are young people generally less rebellious when there&#x27;s a legitimate threat to criticising your country? How widely accepted is Vietnamese education with regards to politics and history? Do people tend to question it or accept it wholesale?
 Sorry if this is a controversial topic, it&#x27;s just something that&#x27;s been on my mind

                              <span>Hi! I’m visiting from overseas and have a few questions about the area:
 1) I can see lots of demolished buildings around Da Nang - what happened? 
 2) I noticed some buildings (houses mostly) are in the middle of empty urban lots - how come? 
 3) A lot of the shops in old town Hoi An sell the exact same products - why is this? Edit: by this I mean multiple stores selling the exact same T-shirt. Supply issue? Same owners? 
 4) In Da Nang lots of beach front hotels have been half built - is this because of Covid? 
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>I am coming home to the mother land for three weeks.
 I&#x27;ve been looking for things to do in Saigon and nothing really appeals to me. Obviously food and coffee culture there is amazing but what else?
 I also hate busy hustle and bustle cities. I currently live in one and want to get away from it.
 My plan is to go surfing and exploring in vung tau for 5-6 days. And then go to a relaxing resort/beach in phu quoc for 5 days.
 That still leaves about 7 days in Saigon... I wonder if I should just spend more time in vung tau and phu quoc instead of Saigon since I don&#x27;t like city/night life.
 What you guys think?

                              <span>I am Ukrainian model working in Japan. My boyfriend’s Vietnamese. He used to be a model (that is how we met and fell in love 🥰), but now he has his own business.
 He is from a business family in Hanoi. His parents studied abroad and had business in Eastern Europe. So they can speak some Ukrainian. 
 His mom’s a lovely woman. She took care of me like her daughter. She bought me new clothes, taught me Vietnamese. I feel like little princess when staying with his family.
 She told me to get into university, because model is not a long lasting career. She’ll fund my education if I become her daughter in law 
 I love her, but I’m worried she’s trying to control me. Or I’m overthinking, bc I watch too many Korean dramas.
 Do old Viet parents change behavior after a girl become their official con dau?
 Can anyone give thoughts to this topic? ESP Vietnamese people or foreign women getting married with Vietnamese men
 Are there any Eastern European girls marrying with Vietnamese here? How is your relationship with Nha Chong

                              <span>I&#x27;m going for 3 months to hanoi for work related stuff. Should I take an airbnb or search for a normal location ? I don&#x27;t know what kind of insurance there is for airbnbs, is it the same ? It seems cheaper and less complicated for me to take the airbnb but i&#x27;m not sure if I am making the right choice or if there&#x27;s any downsides to it.

                              <span>Hey all, I am visiting Hanoi during early October and wanted to know if you had any recommendations in mind for day trips? Also, how much would these day trips cost?
 I&#x27;ve been told I can let my hotel know that I&#x27;ll be gone for a few days and book a hotel elsewhere, but I&#x27;m broke and would like to use the hotel days I purchased in Hanoi if possible. Why would it be a bad idea to do a day trip anyway?
 Thank you all and happy 4th!

                              <span>Hi các bạn. Một tí background về mình. Mình đi du học Canada từ năm 14 tuổi. Đến bây giờ mình đã 28 tuổi. Tốt nghiệp đh ngành Supply Chain đi làm cũng được 6 năm ở Canada rùi. Hiện mình cũng đã có quốc tịch Canada. Vài tháng trước mình có về Việt Nam đám tang bà mình tiện thể ở Việt Nam 1 tháng để chơi. Mình nhận ra là mình đã bõ lỡ rất nhiều thứ ở Việt Nam từ khi mình đi du học. Từ lúc đó mình có suy nghĩ là mình muốn về Việt Nam làm việc và sinh sống. 1 phần cũng là vì để ở gần ba mẹ và ông mình, 1 phần là muốn tiềm hiểu thêm về ngành Supply Chain ở Việt Nam và mở rộng network và 1 phần nữa là tận hưởng những năm tháng thanh xuân mà mình đã bõ lỡ. Mình có apply vu vơ thì được 1 cty đa quốc gia nhận. Lương ~ $4000 usd/ tháng. Tầm tầm với bên này mình đang làm. Mình suy nghĩ nhiều lắm không biết có nên về hay không. Mình có ny bên này có nhà thuê có xe nhưng ngy mình thì k thể về vs mình được. 
 Các pạn có suy nghĩ gì cho mình xin ý kiến nhá. Thanks all.

                              <span>24 y/o guy been wanting to visit for a while now, but life has gotten in the way up until now. 
 I’d love to stay for 3-6 months, and perhaps visit some other countries in SEA but we will see. Maybe even 6+ months if budget allows. 
 Would this an okay budget? I’ll have around 10k usd/237,100,000 vnd saved, and hoping to spend around 1,000-1500 usd a month if possible, but can go up in budget if needed.
 I’m good with street food and a simple affordable condo/apartment that maybe has a pool or something, I’m a simple guy. I don’t shop much or drink much, but I would like to participate in the nightlife some(few beers) and maybe go on some dates etc like on some weekends. Just have a little fun I guess.
 Sightseeing and experiences.. I have a few places in mind but would love a bunch of recommendations. Id like to explore around most of the country as much as possible so hit me with suggestions of some great places you enjoy. I have an interest in everything really!
 I think that’s about it, haha. And if there’s anyone who wants to show me around/go out for some fun when I land, I’d love to meet. Thanks in advance and hope yall are having a good day :)

                              <span>Question 50 in the English high school graduation exam has stirred up controversy among candidates. 
 &quot;Their pioneering (A) research showed that the learning motivation of the two groups of learners was quite distinctive (B) from each other, and the comparative (C) group whose learning motivation was stronger performed better than the control (D) group.&quot;

 The task requires identifying the underlined part that needs correction. 
 There were debates surrounding the correct answer, particularly regarding options B (distinctive) and C (comparative). Well-known IELTS teachers like Kien Luyen and Mai Phuong weighed in on the matter.
 ​
 🤔 While the official answer is B (distinctive), there are still many teachers who hold reservations about this conclusion.
 ​
 In your opinion, which answer do you believe is correct?

                              <span>I’d like to share with you my story of how I opened a bakery. Before I found my independence, I felt like I was born unlucky. When I was young, I was in a baby walker and fell into a wood stove in the kitchen. There was no knowledge back in those days of how dangerous these baby walkers were. It left me with almost 90% burns to my body. After the accident, I was transported to Children&#x27;s Hospital 1 in Saigon, where I stayed for two years for intensive care and treatment. 
 I felt lonely growing up, I didn&#x27;t have many friends and felt ostracized by society. I dropped out of school due to intense bullying, even though it was my dream. I was lucky though to have one friend who was like me. They also did not go to school because they were bullied due to the way they looked. We spent time toget…</span>

                              <span>I have a couple of Vietnamese flag stickers that I want to put on my laptop (along with Australia, Germany and Esperanto, to represent my favourite languages). However, my girlfriend said the Vietnamese flag (red background, gold star) could be considered offensive to people (particularly southern Vietnamese, who have their own flag AFAIK) who had left Vietnam and might cause a problem if someone sees it. Is it that much of a problem?
 EDIT: I have now plastered the shining star onto the back of my laptop! Ha ha.

                              <span>I know that the salary of the staff at the ward administrative agencies is sometimes only 4.000.000 vnd per month. This salary is even lower than unskilled workers. Even with prime minister, it&#x27;s only around 20.000.000 vnd. With this salary, no one can survive or support their family with only one job. It&#x27;s not uncommon for them to regularly ask people for money when dealing with paperwork. In other words, are the people themselves paying these employees directly, not gorvement? And this is the reason why public administration in Vietnam so troublesome?
 Why don&#x27;t they set up agencies that charge high fees (special lanes) for people&#x27;s convenience? Instead of letting people being confused by the tricks of the staff to force people to pay bribes?

                              <span>I 28m am living in Houston, USA. I have noticed that it can be difficult to practice Vietnamese although I have been learning for some time. Often when I want to speak to the Viet people of Houston they often prefer to speak in English, yes I know that my Vietnamese is not perfect nor is my understanding and that dialect may be a barrier. At times I will ask they try to speak VNese with me even though I may struggle to understand. How do I make it known that I prefer to speak Vietnamese to improve my own understanding? 
 In houston we have many people speaking southern dialects and I have learned a northern dialect. I believe it is best to know and understand multiple dialects. I noticed that people will understand roughly what I am trying to say but out of politeness will not speak Vietnamese with me because they can tell from my speaking that maybe my understanding is not the best this happens most especially with viet kieu. 
 What are suggestions that you all would have to help me engage in normal conversation?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am looking for a Vietnamese native speaker for my two toddler age children. I&#x27;ve reviewed the various tutoring sites and understand they take a large cut of the fees and I would rather those fees go to the tutor. This would be online 2x a week. We&#x27;re in the States and can discuss times. Please DM if interested. 
 My apologies if this is not the right venue.

 Also - if you have experiences of Sheraton Grand Đà Nẵng or IC Đà Nẵng - please share - I&#x27;m thinking of booking these two cool hotels. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>In a souvenir shop in Vietnam, I found this small bottle of what seems to be a wet specimen of a baby cobra, or a snake whiskey? Not sure.
 The bottle is so small: 30 to 50ml max. The seller claims that the snake inside is real. I&#x27;m skeptical but it seems to be true. I also don&#x27;t mind if it isn&#x27;t since it costs less than 5$. 
 I bought four of them as souvenirs for my relatives back home, but now I am wondering if it will be ok to transport these internationally? Is it legal to do so?

                              <span>I&#x27;m tryng to learn Vietnamese, and like every beginner I struggle with the tones. My teacher suggested me to watch some cartoons/shows so I can get used to the speech, but I struggle to find things on Youtube with subtitles. Most of the videos have the auto-generated youtube subtitles, but they are pretty low quality and don&#x27;t always come synchronized with the speech. I&#x27;m looking for some cartoons (mostly because of the smaller vocabulary) that have subtitles on them put on by the creators, not auto generated. Any ideas on what should I search for / recommendations? Thanks in advance 😀

                              <span>Hello,
 I am from New Zealand.
 I will be traveling to Vietnam as part of my travels to South East Asia.
 Exchange rates and options in my country are horrible. None of the banks do exchange of currencies anymore, and the options left here are very slim, and which charge high transaction fees with bad exchange rates given.
 I was wondering if i could bring $NZD bank notes with me and exchange it in Vietnam? Are there currency exchanges in Hanoi that would take NZD currency??
 Appreciate any advice given, thank you!

                              <span>I’ve visited vietnam around 10 times now. I think I want to create even more roots by going longer on my next trip, and spending a few months learning some Vietnamese.
 My question is, I’m thinking of staying in Hai Phong, Hanoi or around Da Nang to study. 
 Does someone have a school recommendation? And also, should I instead consider going to hcm to pick up the southern accent? (I’ve always preferred the north)

                              <span>For me for example I got this weird fascination with the Cups and mugs that your coffee comes in at coffee shops. 
 The Cups and glasses can be small tiny ones to very round ones. Now I&#x27;ve even seen mugs with coffee written on them and matching phins to go on top.

I only have few days off, and I&#x27;ve done some research and Haiphong was the only place where it was affordable and also Sunny. All other places are anticiapted to rain a lot. So I think I will go to Haiphong but I have very few information about it. Do you guys have any information? Thanks in advance!

 EDIT: I was born in Melbourne, Australia but my family is from Ho Chi Minh City, District 4, Quận Tư. So Chợ Sóm Chiếu is very close to my heart having always come back and fourth between Australia and Viet Nam. I can read, speak and write in Vietnamese so please connect in either language, I am always open to improving the mother’s tongue.

                              <span>Xin chào, I&#x27;m a big foodie from Spain who&#x27;s traveling to vietnam in August, and I&#x27;d like to make the most of my culinary experience. I&#x27;d want to learn to recognize the main ingredients and dishes, and understand the essence of Vietnamese cuisine.
 The intention is to, when there, eat as much as possible in authentic places and street vendors.
 Could you recommend some ways to learn about the cuisine (books, Youtube channels, blogs...) or give me some advice on the culinary part of my trip in general? 
 Cảm ơn!

                              <span>I’m attending my first ever Vietnamese wedding and not familiar with Vietnamese customs. So is this dress okay? And what are some Dos and Donts?
 Also, I’m an unmarried young 20-something. What would be an appropriate wedding gift? I don’t know the couple personally but I know the bride’s mother (not friends, but very friendly)

                              <span>Hello,
 I tried egg coffee in Hanoi and loved it. I want to let people in work try it but would rather make it at home. The recipe I found was vanilla extract, egg yolk and condensed milk whisked together. If I made this the night before and kept it in the fridge would it keep it&#x27;s consistency the next day or does it need to be made fresh?

                              <span>A few months ago I went to Phong Nha and had some amazing food. There was a dark green salty dipping sauce they provided. I was told it was a local specialty. Does anyone know the name or how to make it? I think they provided it with some pork to dip into. I am having trouble remembering what it came with. Thanks.

The main reason for disapproval is because they think the prices are outrageous. They recommend I use local vendors. The problem is that I do not speak or read Vietnamese; trying to learn it. I got recommendations before for vendors in Quảng Ngãi but it is all through Facebook and there isn&#x27;t a direct payment option like in the states. Trying to avoid just sending money, seems it feels very impersonal. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I’m a Vietnamese and currently living in the U.S. I want to bring a drone (mini 3 pro) to Vietnam to record my countryside, but I heard that there was problem when you arrive to the Danang International Airport specifically (HAN and SGN are known as friendly drone owners). Do you guys, who arrived at the DAD (international), have any problems with drone confiscation or have any stories about it? Please share your experience, so I can decide to bring it with me or just buy it after my arrival. Thank you so much

                              <span>In short, going Vietnam 18-20days end of July to mid Aug.
 Places been before: DN, Hoian, Hue, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Giang. (went before but dont mind using them as layover).
 I am planning to fly in from Saigon and fly out from Hanoi this time round. Have yet to book tickets
 Places i want to visit: Saigon!, Dalat!, Phong Nha! (4D tour).
 Places i can do without: Mekong Delta (AKA can tho?), Nha Trang, Mai Chau, Phu quoc(worth it?)
 My concern is Dalat to Phong Nha is a little detour, not too sure an efficient way to travel while passing by some other cities. I am considering Dalat to Hoi An 5D motorbike easyrider tour but feels a little expensive, then from Hoi An overnight bus to Phong Nha for 4D caving adventure and then Phong Nha to Mai Chau and to Hanoi back home. 
 It feels a little tired and what suggestions do u have? I can reroute my entire plan again

However she refuses to call me boyfriend, even when strangers ask she clarifies I&#x27;m only &quot;her friend&quot; or &quot;her neighbour&quot;. When challenged she says she&#x27;s still deciding whether I&#x27;m a good person.
 At the same time she wants me to fly to her home city with her at the end of the year. And all her friends and colleagues from work say she talks about me often.
 Is this a cultural difference? Are women from Vietnam always so hesitant to call someone boyfriend?

                              <span>I&#x27;m headed to Da Nang, Hue, and Hoi An for a few weeks and would love any suggestions for what food we should try while we&#x27;re there. We already have down the usual suspects (bun bo hue, banh canh, mi thit nuong, mi quang, banh beo and banh bot lot). 
 I&#x27;d also love to know if there are dishes/food that are hard to find outside of the region or are made differently in the North / South and if there are any specialties we should sample from a specific city.

 I’m thinking of a place that does a class followed by a social ?

                              <span>My 2 weeks in Vietnam’s close to its end. 
 I just want to say, Vietnamese food is unparalleled. I’m also Southeast Asian (Philippines), but the food here hits differently. 
 It’s always perfectly balanced. Flavors aren’t aggressive, yet the food is very flavorful. The servings are always just right. The food is filling, but not heavy on the belly. It’s literally perfect for me. 
 I only stayed in Hanoi and Saigon, but I had the most fun just eating, interacting with locals and travelers, and people-watching. Everything I did here was so self-indulgent lol. 
 I’ll be back, Vietnam. Thank you for your rich history and culture. I learned a lot of your history after coming here, and I have huge respect for the people. 
 I will forever remember this place close to my heart ❤️.

                              <span>I live in my parents owned apartment in a local neighbourhood. I am currently staying here for another year during my time in Vietnam. Although the apartment allows pets, there is a significant number of residents who strongly dislike them and the residents are majority older generation. They often demonstrate closed-mindedness, rudeness, and narcissistic behavior. Additionally, the staff, including security guards and cleaners, engage in gossip and talk behind our backs. I have personally experienced consistent rudeness from an older female cleaner. She unnecessarily reprimanded me when I was about to walk my dog after exiting the lift while she was cleaning. I was unaware of her cleaning schedule, but since then I avoid walking my dog at that time. She has also spread rumors among other residents, falsely labeling my dog and me as dirty. It&#x27;s clear that she holds a personal grudge against me and my dog. I have been ignoring her but she constantly says it when I&#x27;m around and it is bothering me a bit.

That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d like to watch some Viet films. So can you five me recommendations. (It doesn&#x27;t have to have dubs as long as there&#x27;s English/Hungarian subtitles)
 Edit: Also could you tell me places where I can watch them for free? Thank you :)

(Junior positions) I would love to connect with individuals who have personal experience being sent to Vietnam as an expat or have similar IT-related experiences while living and working in Vietnam. Or can drop me any company names where i would have the possibility to work in Vietnam. If you or someone you know fits this description, I would greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations. Looking forward to hearing your stories and advice!

                              <span>4 people, wanting to take multiple grab bikes, at the same time. Like a convoy. 
 How would we go about this? 
 Each order separately, tell bikes 1-3 they need to wait for bike 4 to arrive, and then once bike 4 arrives all head off?
 Would this delay be acceptable to bikes 1-3? Is there some way to do this through the app itself?

                              <span>Im 22 years old and want to learn and experience as much as i can (i live in usa).
 Im with my girlfriend and she is Vietnamese. We dont party, but we do like to have fun and go to arcades/nature/unique things.
 We already did Ba Na Hills, the beach, marble mountain, and next we are thinking about doing My son Sanctuary, or Hoi An.

                              <span>There is a report published recently by a analyst. They said between the three: Viettel, Mobifone and Vinaphone; Viettel wins consistency and core quality, while Vinaphone wins fastest speed almost 3x the second winner being Viettel. Mobifone eats dirt in almost every metric and I feel blind after reading that report. 
 You see, I&#x27;ve been using the same operator for more than a decade and I wonder if there is better fit for my needs, maybe you can find yours here too. I&#x27;m first:
 I use Mobifone.
 Connectivity is okay, worse on height, not much 5G. 
 Customer service is helpful and does available 24/7. 
 Good data package, I paid 300k VND per month for 8GB data daily. There are plenty options. 
 Their App works fine for all basic stuff you need, but the UI always feels like still in the Beta stage and not fully functional. That bugged me the most. 
 What&#x27;s your mobile plan and how is your experience?

 It’s kind of hard to search on Google since the forums are really old. I live around District 1, close to Pasteur. 
 If anyone knows, please let me know :) thank you!

                              <span>When I first came to Vietnam and actually saw these hats I thought they looked really impractical for some reason, and very fragile looking. Plus being in a tourist area and being obviously not Vietnamese I didn’t want to look like a tourist. 
 I get sun burn ridiculously easily and being on a dive boat doesn’t help. I gave in and ended up buying a non la out of pure desperation to keep the sun far away from me. Turns out they’re actually really useful and now I understand why I see so many women wear them.

Besides learning basic Vietnamese and using a translator, are there any cultural issues I should understand? How can I make them feel comfortable? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m currently in the process of authenticating my documents to teach in Vietnam.
 Here&#x27;s the thing; I&#x27;ve already legalized/authenticated my degree but the problem remains with my teaching certificate because the document was issued by a US institution (university) and I&#x27;m not a US citizen besides, my country isn&#x27;t part of that hauge convention thing, so based on my research, i believe I can&#x27;t authenticate the certificate in the US embassy in my home country.
 There&#x27;s too much information online that I don&#x27;t even know where to start and how to properly authenticate it. Has anyone had this experience before? (A non-us citizen authenticating a US document). What should i do? I don&#x27;t want to fly to Vietnam before authenticating my TEFL, i know it would be much harder this way.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m traveling to Vietnam to visit my boyfriends family. I wanted to bring gifts but I don&#x27;t know what I can bring that&#x27;s not available in vietnam. My boyfriend has no idea because he hasn&#x27;t been there in more than ten years but he told me to not bring any clothing since they are produced in vietnam and are sold there cheaper (I wanted to buy Babys clothes for his cousin who gave birth recently).
 What are some things that you buy for your families in vietnam when you visit them? What are the most requested things? I read that gummy bears are very popular but I don&#x27;t want to only bring gummy bears. He doesn&#x27;t have lots of contact with his family so he&#x27;s too shy to ask.

 Discovered this YouTube channel recently and loving it. I just find the random conversations with customers so charming. Super interesting glimpse into the daily life of a Gojek driver.

 Don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re male, female, somewhere in-between, somewhere not in-between, religious, irreligious, Viet, non-Viet, communist, capitalist, or part of some Satanic sex cult (actually that&#x27;d be cool af).
 My IG handle is @benji_man_van if you need to do a background check to make sure I&#x27;m not a weirdo even though I am.
 Edit: Also this is my first time back in Vietnam since I was 6 years old. Nha Trang is so beautiful.

                              <span>Hi,
 I work for a company in Germany and have German citizenship (used to have Vietnamese citizenship). I&#x27;m planning to visit my family in Vietnam and work remotely for my German company from there later this year for about a month.
 The issue is that my company in Germany requires me to have a working permit in Vietnam, or an exempton for one, because according to them &quot;I&#x27;m working in Vietnam&quot;. 
 I have done some research, and it seems like:
 &quot; Working in Vietnam as a manager, executive, expert or technical worker for a period of work of less than 30 days and up to 3 times a year; &quot; may exempts a foreigner from needing a work permit (source https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/vietnam/human-resources-and-payroll/visa-and-employment-permits). 
 However, I have personally asked https://www.vietnam-visa.com. It seems that I&#x27;m not eligible to apply for an exemption of work permit since I don&#x27;t have a sponsor company in Vietnam and technically speaking, I don&#x27;t work for any company in Vietnam.
 Does anybody have any experience applying for an exemption of work permit in Vietnam or something similar?
 Best regards

 I do want to ask what advice would you give to someone moving to Vietnam? I already have a job lined up including my accommodation for the first month. My visa is in the process of being sorted and I’ve started trying to learn Vietnamese. I’m wondering more about daily life, what there is to do, which online resources would you recommend for learning Vietnamese, etc?
 Bonus if you know where the best cà ri gà in Hanoi!

 Hi everyone, I’m a Việt kieu born overseas who’s only spoken Việt to their parents. My language an speaking is lacking as a result of this, and I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for some short novels or Vietnamese history books for me to get used to the language again! 
 Thanks a lot and let me know if I made any typos.

                              <span>This is my second time in Vietnam. The first time I visit Vietnam as a teenage I never heard of the word. I am currently in Vietnam for the second time as an adult and I hear the term Viet Kieu a lot.
 Viet Kieu is a person with Vietnamese blood that is living outside of Vietnam, whether they were born in Vietnam or another country. 
 Sometimes people call me a Viet Kieu or I will tell them that I am a Viet Kieu. Now that I think about it, is it a good thing or bad thing? I know is it a way to label us but I have been saying it with pride. 
 I know different people have their own opinions about Viet Kieu. People may like or dislike us, think we are rich, or expect us to bring gifts from our country to give to our relatives in Vietnam. They may look down on us because we escaped our home country due to the war or think we are lucky because we were able to create a life outside of Vietnam. We may or may not be rich in our country but the money exchange from our country to Vietnam makes us look rich.
 I rented an apartment with my family and they told me all the Viet Kieu lives in this apartment. My family told me girls will want us for citizenship. My mom told me not to tell people that I am in a Viet Kieu in public because I will get robbed.
 A lot of people try to talk to me in English. When I start talking to them in Vietnamese, they would tell me that they thought I was from overseas. I tell them I was born and live overseas. I do ask the locals about this in person but Reddit is a better platform to be straight up. Some people that I ask are the older generation that lived through the war or the new generation that were born after the war. 
 Give it to me straight. Give me your opinion. Is it a title I should wear with pride or embarrassment and shame?

                              <span>I was talking to my dad about Vietnamese pronouns and how different pronouns can feel more intimate and special.
 My favorite pronouns is mình/tôi which typically means the same and is used to refer to yourself but is also used by couples. I like its insinuation that your partner is a part of you and it&#x27;s very cute and endearing.
 Another interesting one is moi/toi which means me and you in French and was sometimes used by folks during the French colonialization of Vietnam.

 I have ridden dirt bikes before and had my own moped in Australia for a few years, and drove a moped in Bali a few times. Just wondering if this will be enough experience to make the drive?

Trong lúc mình học xa, mẹ thường gọi điện và bảo nhớ mình. Nhưng khi vừa về thì mẹ mình lại thái độ với mình, rằng mình không thương bà tại mình không thường xuyên gọi về và cằn nhằn liên tục.

We&#x27;ve been in Thailand for over a year and I was wondering about the cultural norms in Vietnam. In Thailand things like, &quot;saving face,&quot; being non-confrontational, feet low/head high, etc. are cultural norms/part of daily life. What are some Vietnamese cultural norms/do&#x27;s &amp; dont&#x27;s that we should know of? Thanks!

 Is anyone here using the starlink kit already? Can you share your experience with it (pricing, import fees, speed, connectivity issues and monthly payments if any etc) and if possible, the city you are living in? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I was born and raised in Vietnam, but I&#x27;ve spent a significant portion of my life living overseas. Now that I&#x27;m back in HCM City, I&#x27;m feeling a bit out of touch and I&#x27;m looking for advice on how to meet new people and make connections here.
 I know dating apps are popular these days, but I&#x27;m honestly not the best when it comes to texting and connecting with people I don&#x27;t know well. I prefer more personal interactions where I can get to know someone face-to-face.
 So, my question is, what are some effective ways for me to meet and connect with people in HCM city? Are there any local events, clubs, or communities that you would recommend joining? Maybe you know of specific places where people tend to gather and socialize? All suggestion or personal experience is welcome.
 p/s: I speak both english and vietnamese fluently.

                              <span>I guess many guys here are using Badoo for casual dating. You all must have already be warned many times. But I’ll be another one to remind you again based on my terrible dating experience. There are girls out there who will rob you! This girl took whatever she can from my apartment while I was napping and took off. And of course, the police don’t give a crap as usual. Badoo doesn’t give a crap. Everyone just sits back and enjoys a good story of how a dumb foreigner was robbed by a cunning Vietnamese girl. Take care my friends. I repeat.

                              <span>Calling the other on the phone only to sit on the phone in silence. 
 I&#x27;m sorry if you do this haha, but it&#x27;s so annoying to witness/be around when this is happening! For example: My aunt called my other aunt (whose house we were driving to which is less than 15 mins away) and put her on speakerphone and all I heard was my other aunt tussling dishes and food prepping for a house party. My dad and aunt do this too and my cousin told me her old bosses at the nail shop she used to work at do that too! If I&#x27;m around someone doing it I don&#x27;t even like to talk cause it feels like the other person silent on the other end of the phonecall is eavesdropping or that I&#x27;m intruding even though they&#x27;re sitting in silence lol. My cousin and I were talking about it but we didn&#x27;t have a good reason as to why. 
 What is the reason?!

                              <span>I am doing a 11 day trip and visiting these cities. Will be traveling by plane. About 3-4 days each country.
 I plan to stay the weekend in Hanoi for the night life.
 I know this route is odd as I am jumping from Cambodia and Vietnam but they were the cheapest flight with no layovers. I’m don’t want to do long bus trips considering my trip is short. 
 Has anyone done this route or something similar?
 I’m looking for recommendation on what to do and in which order. I’m getting little overwhelmed with the options I see. Considering this is a short trip, what do you think is an absolute must do? Time frame and cost would be good

                              <span>(Edit: the title is supposed to say &quot;Man needs help learning English&quot; not Vietnamese. I also posted this in r/Vietnamese and I guess the words got jumbled around in my head, sorry)
 I should start by saying that I am only assuming this man is Vietnamese, because I googled his name, Tran, and Google says it&#x27;s a Vietnamese name. 
 I work at a gym, and this man comes in to work out and use our massage chairs. Any time he needs to communicate something to me he uses Google translate, and he does know a few phrases like &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;good night,&quot; but today he brings his phone up to me and shows me his question, which is that he would like help learning English. 
 He asked for my phone number and I didn&#x27;t want to be rude, so I gave it to him, but he texted me saying he needs someone to help him learn English. 
 I&#x27;m not really a teacher, and I definitely don&#x27;t speak Vietnamese. I want to provide some sort of help, because he&#x27;s always so nice and patient when I&#x27;m helping with whatever he needs around the gym, but I&#x27;m at a loss for what to say. 
 I was hoping maybe reddit would be a good place to find people who understand Vietnamese culture, and might know what sort of help he is looking for specifically?
 (I have texted him asking if he is Vietnamese just to be sure. I really hope that doesn&#x27;t come off as rude. Just trying my best guys. Waiting on that response)
 (I flaired this as discussion but realistically a flair like &quot;language&quot; might be more apt. I picked what seemed to make the most sense out of the options, sorry if I didn&#x27;t use it right)

                              <span>Vietnamese born American here. I am currently solo traveling Vietnam from north to south. My family is from Saigon. When I travel or live with my family, I only get their point of view and bias opinions.
 Since I have been traveling the north solo, I have interacted with locals. It is hard to understand non-Saigon accent sometimes but I can understand enough to hold a conversation. I will tell them that Hanoi accent is hard to understand and that I learned Vietnamese from my family who is from Saigon. One person said that Hanoi Vietnamese is the proper way. Even the American War museum was so much different from American history. It shows how little I know about my roots.
 Please recommend your 3 top must read books. It can be about the war, history in general, culture, or anything.
 The books have to be in English because I cannot read Vietnamese lol.

                              <span>I ordered perfume from abroad in the amount 1,400,000 VND total, and 900,000 VND before shipping. 
 They say:
  
This shipment contains cosmetics. As articles 35 circular 06/2011/TT-BYT, consignee can only imports cosmetics with total customs value under 1,000,000VND. If it’s over 1,000,000VND, you must provide the import permit from Ministry of Health.
  
Can that really be right..?! You need a permit from the ministry of health? I found the referenced legislation here but I see no mention anywhere of a 1,000,000 limit on imports 🤷

                              <span>I wonder if in Vietnam they are aware of what is called &quot;noise-induced hearing loss&quot;. It&#x27;s just that I was just wandering the internet and found a WHO document that says the Western Pacific (including Vietnam) is and will continue to be the most affected area. So in Vietnam people are aware of this and does the government make action to raise people&#x27;s awareness about this problem ? What is the way they do it?

                              <span>i grew up abroad and while my parents left about 50 years ago, they seem to hold a slight interest in french culture, but overall the only time we really encountered anything related to france was when speaking viet and running into the loanwords. they grew up shortly after vietnam was a french colony, so had a french-ish education and usually display a moderately positive idea of french things (like fashion, food, language, etc). but how do people nowadays generally think about france, whether viet in VN or viet abroad? i have read that the french presence in VN was quite violent and not just food/language. do many VN people today (especially older ones) still have any interest in france or french culture? are there many lingering ties to french culture in today’s vietnamese culture or society (other than the loanwords)? as a vietnamese, do you embrace it, feel indifferent about it, or have resentment towards it?

                              <span>Hi everyone! My name is Victor, from Saigon Dragon Studios. For a bit more than 2 years now we’ve worked on the RTS game Space Tales, and today we’re making its Steam page public :)
 https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457960/Space_Tales/?beta&#x3D;0
 Quick background about us: we’ve launched SDS in 2015, as an outsourcing studio specializing in video game 2D and 3D arts. Vietnam (and HCMC) are well known in the video game industry as several top outsourcing companies are located there. A ton of Vietnamese talents have worked on famous games/movies. Surprisingly however, there aren’t many studios in Vietnam who develop and publish their own games (– whenever I am in a game convention for example I always hear ‘ah yes Vietnam, it’s where Flappy Bird was made”, which really annoys me because it’s not representative of the talents Vietnam has.)
 A couple of years ago we decided to start working on our own game in parallel of our outsourcing services, and we wanted to do as much as possible in Vietnam (only music and sounds are being made elsewhere). We still have a lot of work to do on our game, but we would love to hear your feedback on what we have to show for now.
 The teaser for our game can also be watched on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;elHEmpUTcEk 
 Looking forward to receiving your feedback.

 Vietnamese legislators on June 27th finally agreed to extend the validity of tourist e-visas to 90 days and allow multiple entries. How this move affects the current situation?

                              <span>I’m 22 and was born in the US, my parents both immigrated from vietnam. I visited when I was 4 but don’t remember much except the blistering heat. My mom basically forced me to come with her this past June, and I was dreading it bc the time difference, the heat, and the fact that it’s more of a developing country and I’m so spoiled in the Us. Well that was so naive of me because I definitely had an unforgettable experience and vietnam blew me away. 
 We backpacked a bit through vietnam, we went to Saigon, Canh Tho, Cu Chi, Sapa, Hanoi, halong bay, phu quoc, Mekong, tay ninh. At first when I landed I couldn’t wait to get back home. But throughout the trip , the sights were in believable, the food amazing, the motorbikes were so fun, and just cruising through the streets people watching of the cities was so enjoyable. There was just so much to see culture wise as well and opened my eyes to a different lens of the world. and now that I’m back home I feel a small heartache which I wasn’t expecting. It’s been 2 days and I’m still thinking abt this trip
 Although some people were rude and inconsiderate, most were so kind, they treated me and my sister like celebrities. (I thought we looked viet but guess not lol) ppl were constantly approaching us saying we were beautiful. Also i noticed that everyone talks to each other like they already know each other, which is so different than in america. I loved vietnam and want to go back again. This trip holds a special place in my heart and I think will trigger me to start travelling internationally more because that was transformative

                              <span>I shipped a small package to a friend in Hanoi using USPS Priority Mail but haven&#x27;t gotten any tracking updates since May 26th.
 The last update was: 
 &quot;Dispatched from sorting center
 Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam&quot;
 Should I be worried it&#x27;s taken this long, is there something specific to Contact? I double checked just to see if the package got transferred to another carrier (VN post and EMS), but neither showed up anything.

                              <span>Hey everyone !
 I recently met, then started dating a wonderful girl from Vietnam. Her birthday is quite soon, i have my ideas on what to buy her, but I was wondering if theres any particular gift that a Vietnamese girl, or Vietnamese people might appreciate for their birthday. 
 It&#x27;s been a month or so, but we really, really appreciate each other a lot already, so something cheesy is ok too. That can include cooking. Already tried egg coffee and lemongrass chicken so far. She&#x27;s in her mid 20s if that helps, and we both live in Europe.
 Also, I wanted to give appreciation to you guys in general, I didn&#x27;t know much about Vietnam, but you guys are so nice and welcoming It&#x27;s scary, your country&#x27;s history is pretty humbling too. I can&#x27;t wait to be lucky enough to visit Hanoi one day !
 Thanks, in advance.

 I&#x27;m planning a trip in December. I spent six weeks in Central Vietnam about 10 years ago and I loved it! Unfortunately I&#x27;ve been struggling with health problems for the last couple of years, and so this trip is very much going to be a relax by the pool type of affair.
 I was considering Hoi An or potentially Sapa for a 10 day stay? The touristy nature of Hoi An is a bit confronting whereas the Northern mountain ranges are attractive as hell to me. Can anyone lend their opinion/give any recommendations for a resort-style stay that isn&#x27;t going to be busy to the point of stressful?
 Proposed Itinerary
 December 1st - 4th Fly into Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay for a few nights to recover from flight
 December 4th - 14th Bus/train/plane to destination and stay for 10 days
 December 14th - 17th Bus/train/plane back to Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay a few days before departure
 Additional Info
  
I should be able to manage around 5,000 steps each day
 Budget is around $4,000 AUD for two people for 17 days (not including flights)
 I&#x27;m used to travelling for the adventure so this style of travel will be very new to me. Anything luxurious + off the beaten path is very appealing!
  
Would appreciate any help! Thanks.

My plan was to visit check-in to hotel and leave for bana hills as soon as I land in danang but I&#x27;ve not slept throughout night. Can you people suggest at what time I should travel from da nang to ba Na hills from city ? Is going there early morning 9-10 is must or we can enjoy same thing in evening 3-4pm too ? 
 Also where to buy bana hills tickets ? Online or directly from the hills ? 
 Thanks in advance and good morning.

                              <span>Currently in Saigon and just learnt that Vietnam has culturally significant trees called heritage trees. Is there a map or some resource I could use to locate some. Thank you!

                              <span>When viets who were born abroad come to vietnam, is it easy to distinguish if they grew up elsewhere? assuming they can speak the language, are they usually treated like foreigners or viewed differently from local-born viets? i was born during the diaspora and would really like to go to vietnam one day. VN was my first language, so i’m not worried about understanding the language but i probably have a bit of an accent and am not sure how i would blend in or if people would even recognize me as one (i’m kinda pale so people sometimes think im chinese lol). but i’m curious to know what it’s like for others in the same situation. if you were born somewhere else and then came to vietnam how was the experience? were you treated more as a vietnamese or as a foreigner?

 And where can I buy them in Saigon? Thank you.

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I&#x27;m in Hue for a few nights, looking forward to exploring the imperial city amongst other things soon. Was just thinking I might take myself to the cinema this week to watch the new Indiana Jones but not sure which one to go - there seems to be 4 in relatively close proximity to each other. Which one stands out amongst the pack and why?
 Thanks!
