                              <span>Wow... this is probably an impossible question to answer, but we&#x27;re planning our 2 week trip to Vietnam March 7-21 and after accounting for Hanoi (3ish days), Hoi An (3ish days), Ninh Binh (2ish days), I feel like we can only include 1 of these &#x27;adventure&#x27; places to not feel rushed. If you HAD to pick 1 (maaaybe 2) of these experiences, what&#x27;s your pick?
 3ish days to trek in Sapa
 4 days motorbiking the Ha Giang Loop
 3 days with a guided cave expedition in Phong Nha
 3 days motorbiking/trekking in Dalat
 Some background info: my wife and I are in our late 20&#x27;s and love combining city life, food, culture, and nature/adventure on our trips. If anything, it&#x27;s hard for us to &#x27;chill&#x27; and slow down while traveling, but we&#x27;re certainly trying to embody that on this trip more than others :)

                              <span>I plan to live in Vietnam for 6 months later this year, and hope to bring my cat with me. I will be flying from Canada to Vietnam. With a brief google search I&#x27;ve found that as long as my cat fits in a carry on bag under my seat, has her rabies shot, documents with her history of vaccines, and a vet approved letter she should be able to fly and enter the country with me. 
 I&#x27;d love to know if anyone can share their experience travelling with a pet to Vietnam and if I am missing any information. Thank you!

 I am from the USA, so I am nervous about culturally offending locals from my ignorance, so I want to study up on some basic things to do or not to do. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello! Please help me (39F and Canadian) do something kind for my Vietnamese immigrant neighbours (late 20s M/F and 3F) for Lunar New Year tomorrow.
 They are such good neighbours! They made me pho when I had surgery and they feed my children homemade spring rolls. One time the Ba Noi was visiting from Vietnam and she made me shrimp in banana leaves but I didn’t know how to eat it. I tried to ask the Ba Noi but she doesn’t speak English so I just tried to take a bite out of the banana leaf. The Ba Noi laughed and laughed and showed me how to unwrap them and eat the shrimp.
 Their little 3F comes over to play with my kids almost every day and we just love her so much. Her parents work so hard — six days a week and long hours. They are such good people and I’m so happy to know them. 
 Anyhow, tomorrow is Lunar New Year and I know they usually have a big party with their Vietnamese friends and set off fireworks. 
 I read that usually you give gifts of money in red envelopes for Lunar New Year. Would that be appropriate for me, their white Canadian neighbour, to bring over tomorrow?
 My two concerns are that I don’t want them to feel that they have to invite me to their party, reciprocate the gift or make them uncomfortable. Also I don’t want to accidentally do something unlucky.
 Thank you Reddit for any advice you can give me!

                              <span>We are considering a month summer trip on the Vietnam SE coast. Potentially flying into Denang and spending a week in Hoi An and then maybe flying or night bus/train to Nha Trang and staying there for 3 weeks for relaxing beach time. 
 I’ve read you can’t rent a car in Vietnam and we would not feel comfortable riding scooters with our kid (or even probably just an adult 🤣). 
 The places I’m looking at to stay are not in the city center so we can have more space and a pool. We already live in a high rise in a big SE Asian city, so I’d prefer a villa experience while on vacation. 
 My husband thinks having to use Grab multiple time a day if you want to grocery shop, eat out, visit a different beach will be a huge hassle and the cost will add up. This feels like a dealbreaker to him and he thinks we should scrap the Vietnam idea and go to a different country. :(. I read about hiring a car with driver for a few weeks. This sounds pretty weird to me and maybe awkward, but I figured I need to explore this option.
 How do you find a trusted driver like that? Through your villa rental management staff or is their a reputable company people use? I’ve read about scams where drivers will try to take you to restaurants or tours that give them a commission, which I want to avoid. 
 TIA!

                              <span>My Vietnamese fiancé (25F) and I (30M) are getting married in the UK in a few months. She has a marriage visa for the UK and we’ve done our notice of marriage with our local government. The Registar said that we need to get paperwork from the Vietnam Embassy in London. Looking online and the only information I can find is for if we are getting married in Vietnam. 
 Anyone with experience in the area, your insight would be greatly appreciated! TIA

                              <span>Hey all, we&#x27;re travelling to Vietnam with our two kids (one is two years old and one is four months) in mid Feb, for three weeks. Are there any things we absolutely must see?
 Current plan is to fly in and out of HCMC, travelling up the country between, with potential stops in Hoi An, Hanoi, and maybe Phu Quoc. But suggestions are very much welcome!

                              <span>I’m a first-year college student from the States studying geographic information systems and computer science. My university has a study abroad program with RMIT Vietnam that I’m interested in and was wondering how good the university is regarding their curriculum and class settings. I’m set to graduate a year early within my degree plan as I’ve earned many college credits during high school and I want to have an opportunity to go out of the States to study abroad during my 3 years in college.
 How are the programs or courses in information technology and computer science there? Most importantly, what’s the outlook like with the tech or CS industry in Vietnam as I’m interested in networking around as well. I’m looking at doing a semester worth of courses, so any insights about university life and studies revolving around the RMIT campus or Vietnam in general are highly appreciated.

                              <span>I am really amazed so I had to make a post. Not sure if it’s the hot climate or the travel jitters or something else, but I just have trouble finishing my meals here
 Vegetable Spring rolls look tiny, but somehow I already feel full after eating just a couple. Bánh mì is another one - just half a sandwich and I’m already satisfied. And don’t get me started on the pho or bun bo hue - I think it would take me two full days to finish one bowl
 Back home I could easily devour several slices of pizza and still be hungry, so not sure why Vietnamese food is filling me up so quickly lol

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I applied for visa through them thinking they were government official site (gov.vn) and received the e-visa about a week later. I then asked a question about how my name appears on the e-visa (last,first, middle vs. last, middle,first) and got no response. It’s been a week since. I read the on the embassy website that visas done by third party may not be legit and can result in entrance refusal. Anyone has experience with this site or this kind of service? Thanks

 Otherwise, do you know any place or person from where to buy snus/nicotine pouches around DaNang?

                              <span>I arrived a week ago and thinking of doing a video to present HCMC.
 Am asking the locals here and also any expats in case I miss anything.
 It can be places to visit, foods, history, anecdotes or anything that can be interesting.
 Want to keep first impressions fresh and stir the curiosity of anyone who might be interested in visiting.
 Serious replies please and open to suggestions.
 P.S: Let me know what I should avoid photographing or filming if anything.

                              <span>Hi all, I am planning a trip of about 3/4 weeks in Vietnam and I would like to travel the whole country from north to south (or maybe the other way around).
 Because of work, the only times I can take a full 3 to 4 weeks is either August or end of December/beginning of January around the Christmas holidays. I seem to understand that both these times are not ideal from a weather point of view.
 I have been researching quite a bit and if I got it right it looks like I am going to risk typhoons in the north in August; while December is quite cold in the north and very rainy in the central area of Hue and Hoi An.
 Unfortunately I cannot get around these two times of the year, so I was wondering if you have any suggestions. Maybe some of you have been in August or December and can let me know if it&#x27;s really risky to the point of having the whole trip ruined by weather?
 I am somewhat tending towards December. Can you enjoy the cruise in Halong Bay at this time or is it too cold and foggy?
 Thanks so much for any tip you may want to give me! :)

                              <span>We’ve been using a Vietnamese supplier exporting products to me abroad and recently their quality has gone down with the most recent completely faulty and unusable. 
 I’m also certain they’re cheating taxes making me so weird things sending to their personal accounts instead of their business bank account. 
 What are my options. They refuse to refund me. I’m a small business and it’s really going to hurt me if they won’t refund me. 
 Thanks in advance.

 I am backpacking Vietnam in February/March, starting in Hanoi and then settling in HCMC to work.
 What would be best for me to buy travelling wise when I get to Vietnam, rather than here in the UK, to potentially save money?
 I know its a broad question so I do apologise but anyone with experience etc the help would be much much appreciated :)

                              <span>Hi! I am trying to find some funny jokes that will help me better understand the humor. From my research it seems the North vietnamese culture has a lot of wordplay jokes, and the South favors slapstick comedy. What are some of your favorite jokes, and if you could also explain in English why they are funny that would help a lot, too! I am a total beginner in my learning of the language. Thank you to everyone who shares :)

                              <span>As a foreigner here that has a deep love for Vietnam and its culture, i always felt it was important to learn the language. My Vietnamese is ok, but it could, should and one day will be much better! 
 My honest question is though ... Why do so many Vietnamese people make it so hard to learn the language? By this i mean, if I say something wrong in Thai or Khmer, or Italian, I am corrected and helped. In Vietnam, they just give you the &quot;wavy hands&quot; or worse still laugh!
 When Vietnamese speak English to me, much of it is wrong, but I appreciate that they are trying and I &quot;autocorrect&quot; what they said in my head, so as to not embarrass them and then I answer them. The same cannot be said the other way. 
 I really am not meaning to be rude, but why do many Vietnamese (I appreciate it not all) simply try to help me, by autocorrecting and helping me to speak better? 
 Many thanks for all your help!

                              <span>As someone who works in football here in Vietnam (and across Asia) as a foreigner Vietnamese football is as fascinating as much as it is infuriating.
 Like most leagues and countries there are issues with corruption, greed and self interest. But what really gets me with Vietnam is the MASSIVE potential for the sport, the huge love for the support... but the terrible attendances to league games.
 Sure there are issues with marketing, match fixing, poor kick off times, poor product and more... but I would like to ask the Vietnamese in this group, and those that live here... What are the issues YOU see in Vietnamese football and how would you change them to make things better? Thanks!

                              <span>For clarity - I&#x27;m trying to understand the motivations of the Southern Vietnamese people during the war. 
 I understand the Catholics, land owners, and capitalists. They would obviously side with Western ideals.
 But it doesn&#x27;t explain the Buddhist majority, or the majority of people who were not that wealthy. Why did they fight with the U.S. against Ho Chi Minh? Can anyone shed some light on this issue? What were their motivations and beliefs?
 Every time I try to read about this I get the U.S. and International perspective. But I never understand what was happening with the actual Vietnamese people there.

                              <span>My girlfriend has been telling me about Lunar New Year. She grew up in Vietnam, we both currently live in the US (I&#x27;m white). I want to give her one of the red envelopes with lucky money but I don&#x27;t know how much to give. I&#x27;m 3 years older than her if that&#x27;s relevant. She said her lucky numbers are 6 and 8 so does it make sense to give her like $8? From what I&#x27;ve read it seems like the amount isn&#x27;t supposed to be a lot but I don&#x27;t want to be insensitive to her culture by giving too much or too little.

                              <span>Client lost £30,000. Supplier not responding to messages. Absolute nightmare. How is legal services in Vietnam? A person said that there is no point inform the police or contacting the lawyer; consider the money gone. Is that the case? 
 I have all the details of the business and the person. Also got his pictures.
 An update: A local informant has stated, it&#x27;s possible that he filed bankruptcy.

                              <span>Hi all. My girlfriend is from Vietnam and she usually gets pretty homesick around this time of year for obvious reasons. I’m trying to think of a nice way for us to do something on Saturday night to celebrate. It’s our second Tết together, last year we did some basic decorating but it was hard to find anything good around where we are. She made some traditional food as well. This year I want to surprise her with something nice but don’t know what to do. Any ideas? Even something simple would be fine I think.

                              <span>Hello fellow Redditors,
 I am a 47-year-old Belgian man who has had the pleasure of visiting Vietnam 12 times, spending a total of 16 months there. Through my interactions with the South Vietnamese community where I live, as well as my multiple visits and online relationships, I have become fluent in speaking and writing in Vietnamese. In fact, when a native Vietnamese speaker hears me on the phone, they often mistake me for a Vietnamese person. In addition to my fluency in Vietnamese, I also speak French, Dutch and English, and have a basic understanding of German.
 My dream is to find a job in South Vietnam, but I am facing a bit of a hurdle. I have been working for the government since 1996 and therefore do not have any other qualifications beyond my high school diploma. Additionally, I have no concrete proof of the skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout my career. However, I am skilled in working with computers and have strong communication abilities. My current job involves designing templates that are sent to millions of citizens, but the software I use is not utilized by any companies in Vietnam.
 I am willing to accept a salary that is typical for Vietnam, as money is not a concern for me. My only qualifications are my high school diploma and my work experience, so my CV is essentially my career. I am open to any job, but I am unsure of the best course of action. Should I try to find a job while on a tourist visa and do visa runs until I secure employment? Or, should I enroll in a school in Ho Chi Minh City in order to obtain a student visa? I believe my English and Vietnamese language abilities are sufficient to pass any necessary tests, and I am eager to immerse myself in the educational experience.
 All I know is that I am happiest when I am in Vietnam, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to make my dream a reality. Thank you for reading and for your responses.

 For context I am a Vietnamese Canadian living in Canada, a little over a month ago I had came back from my Vietnam trip and had matched on bumble with this girl from Vietnam. Long story short ever since then I&#x27;ve been feeling some type of way towards her (in a good way not a bad way).
 Growing up in Canada I&#x27;ve never really had the need to say new year wishes in Vietnamese to my other friends here but rather just my grandparents and parents. So I&#x27;m used to saying things like chúc mừng năm mới.. or con chúc ông bà nhiều xúc khỏe song lâu tram tuoi etc. 
 So my question is are there any ideas on how I can send her new year wishes without just the plain chúc mừng năm mới? In other words what are some ways to send wishes from friend to friend. 
 From the top of my head in the context of friend to friend, I can only think of wishing for good health, happiness and lots of money. 
 Apologies if this question came out kind of odd or if i&#x27;m overthinking it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to Vietnam in October and a bit unsure about this. I get Xanax prescribed, but only for flying - it&#x27;s not an ongoing prescription. The UK government suggested I need to bring a prescription and a letter from my doctor, but they can be overzealous. I&#x27;d rather be cautious though !

                              <span>Hi, I study in Hanoi for the semester, and I&#x27;m in Sài Gòn for a week, and every Vietnamese I know told me Sài Gòn is just good for food and clubbing, nothing to visit (their words). So what typical/hard to find elsewhere food can I eat here and where in the city? I already tried hủ tiếu, bánh mí chảo and Bánh tráng trộn, they were all great. (if by any luck you know a good place to visit, share with us :)))

                              <span>My wife and I are visiting VN from March 8-26th. Where we are flying into and out is still in the air depending on the itinerary. I&#x27;m a 41 Hue refugee that at 2 months old we escaped from VN to Hong Kong then Philippines then CA, US. I have never been back, and the plan was to visit in 2020 but covid hit. Now is the time. Super excited. Minus traveling days we should have 16 full days.
 Here are the places I wanted to visit: Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Long bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An.
 Originally we wanted to fly into Saigon then fly into Da Nang and make our way up north and fly home from Hanoi. However after watching vids on youtube and reading, wondering if we should just skip Saigon and spread say 2 days to the cities mentioned above. Is it worth visiting giving our amount of days in VN? I&#x27;ve heard people say they wouldn&#x27;t have been sad if they skip it while others say it&#x27;s a must visit. Also how many days of each cities is sufficient.
 Any suggestions would be helpful. thank you.

I visited her twice in Vietnam and on the second visit found out she had been cheating on me through snooping. I need the help from someone to figure out what was said by her in her texts so I know what happened exactly. I believe this will give me some peace. I have quite a lot of texts. Is anybody willing to help me?

                              <span>I will be visiting VN next month from Canada. I heard you get a better rate for money exchange if you bring brand new $100 CAD bills as opposed to old $100 CAD bills. Is this true ? Also, where is the best place for money exchange in District 4 of HCMC?

                              <span>Hi Everyone
 I am hoping this is the right place to ask.
 I am currently trying to buy a few products from Vietnam (essentially coffee, that i am not able to find in France or at 5x time the price). I am wondering if someone could help locally or if you know a proxy buying service dedicated to that?
 Most of the Vietnamese website i have tried don’t deliver abroad.
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m from Germany and my gf and her family are from Hanoi. As I have a genuine personal interest in history in general and Vietnamese history in particular, I would like to ask my parents-in-law about their experiences in the American War.
 They are in their early 70s and I know he was a soldier in the NVA. Would it be acceptable to bring this topic up in a respectful way and in an appropriate setting (e.g. during a one-on-one conversation while going for a walk, not at the family dinner table)?
 I&#x27;m asking because - unsurprisingly - WWII is still a touchy topic in Germany. But these two wars are obviously very different, with Germany being the aggressor and committing genocide. My own grandparents never talkes about WWII, although the topic was still always weirdly present in the background.
 I&#x27;ve done a bit of reading beforehand (Last Night I Dreamed of Peace by Đặng Thùy Trâm, The Sorrow of War by Bảo Ninh, The Peguin History of Modern Vietnam by Christopher Goscha) and watched the Ken Burns documentary about the War, so I wouldn&#x27;t be totally ignorant and ask dumb/insensitive questions.

                              <span>Grandfather is name Tuat Van Nguyen born in Hanoi, Vietnam and I believe he grew up in Hanoi, where he was kidnapped on his way to Catholic school. His father was a locksmith. This is all I can gather from him as it is it is a very sensitive topic. We are heading back to Vietnam to search for his parents, or any members of his family, in Saigon and then making our way to Hanoi. I am hoping I can get a head start with some search tips online. It seems the best way to go searching for this would be to look at church records but unfortunately, I need help on the ground. Or any sort of obituary. He seemed to recall one sister. Would it be worth hiring a private investigator? This time we&#x27;re going back in April. I am his first granddaughter 33 years old and will accompany him.
 Both his grandparents lived in Thai Binh, and he lived there with them before he went to school in Hanoi with his parents.
 His father, Yet Van Nguyen
 Mother, Do Thi Nguyen
 Grandfather, Tuat Van Nguyen born 07/15/1935. He did spend some time in Paris, I think when he was about in his 20s. Someone took him under his wing but he left back to Vietnam to search again.

                              <span>Hi everyone - I&#x27;ve spent the last few days combing through all your posts on traveling Vietnam, lots of helpful stuff so thanks to everyone. Currently planning on flying to Hanoi mid Sept, spending a couple days there and bussing to Ha Giang, doing the loop on motorbike then coming back. 
 My bday is at the end of the trip and I&#x27;d like to splurge a little at a luxury-ish resort or something where I can really chill out and be taken care of. From what I&#x27;ve read so far, current top of the list is Da Nang, but just wanted to see if anyone has any other good recs. 
 Wants
 -Remote-ish, not overly touristy but still some kind of town action we can walk to for food, beers, etc.
 -Resort with a pool, preferably overlooking the beach
 -Proximity to other towns/beaches so we can rent scooters and go on little day trips
 Recommendations on Towns or actual resorts would be amazing!

                              <span>When compared to other Sinosphere nations like China, South Korea, and Japan, Vietnamese culture seems more chill. Education is efficient and not stressful while work culture isn&#x27;t as intense. Vietnamese students have more extracurricular activities to do such as football compared to Chinese students who study day and night from the start of life to prepare for the gaokao. Vietnamese suicide rates are much lower than Japan&#x27;s or South Korea&#x27;s.
 What cultural/social/political developments led to Vietnamese culture being more chill?

                              <span>Hi,
 I’m a 25 year old guy, coming from Canada. Will be in Saigon from Feb 13-23, then over to Hanoi.
 I’ll be around the District 1 area (in general, still confirming Airbnb) and I’d like to see if anyone wants to be friends? Or do some tourist things together?
 I love food and would like to try as much as I can around the area! I love experiencing new things, and getting tattoos. 
 I’m also open to any local ideas of things to do around the area, or day trips for motorcycle?
 Send me a DM, or comment!

                              <span>Hello fellow bikers! Has anyone had experience with the Yamaha R15 vs the CBR 150R? I have not fully decided, but I&#x27;m leaning heavily on the smaller 150cc for less weight and fuel economy. I have past experience with 300cc-600cc motorbikes but it doesn&#x27;t make sense to ride the bigger bikes in Vietnam. I&#x27;m looking to ride around town and occasional long rides.
 I&#x27;m open to getting the R3 or Ninja 400 as well.
 Please let me know what your best experiences are and what makes good sense. (Note: I will have an Airblade in case I&#x27;m lazy.)
 Thanks in advance!

 I wasn&#x27;t raised In n Asian household so I was slowly learning about my Viet culture 
 I went to a Vietnamese restaurant, and I couldn&#x27;t finish all my food, and I felt really bad about it.... because I didn&#x27;t want to leave a bad impression. I heard that it&#x27;s seen as wasting food, and is also disrespectful to the chef in other east Asian cultures just didn&#x27;t know if it was the same for Viet. I feel really bad about it.

If anyone plays football or tennis I&#x27;d love to give you a game. Even if you&#x27;d be free to chill out and just go for a coffee and walk or whether you want to hit the local bars I&#x27;m just love to have some nice company!
 ​
 Please dm if interested. Thank you!!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 30 year old guy from Europe who is into meditation and music and spirituality. Kinda bored and most of my friends have left for tet. I sometimes walk or cycle around West lake. I haven&#x27;t been here for long so wondering if anyone wants to grab a coffee or beer or take a walk over tet. Happy holidays guys.

                              <span>Long story short: I&#x27;m a Vietnamese foreign student in the States and in the process of waiting for a green card here. My dad got an MBA during the 1990s, and he went back home to work for an insurance company. My mom obtained a law degree in Vietnam and worked in a different field. My question is: what kind of jobs can my parents do? Obviously, I will be the person who helps them start over and climb the social ladder, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t want them to struggle in old age. Can my dad start over and work at a company with his US degree, even though it will take several years to adjust and improve his English? What kind of jobs can my mom do? I have heard a lotta became nail techs, but I&#x27;m unsure if she could handle all the drama and long working hours. I honestly love them so much for all the work they put in to send me here, so at least I want to help them with a new life :( If any of yall in similar boats, I would love to hear yall your experiences!!

                              <span>I’m in Vietnam, Hoc Mon area. I brought plenty of hundreds and some twenties. I have 2 objectives:
  
I need single dollar bills. Where can I change one of my hundreds into a hundred singles. 
 
I understand the quality of usd is very important here; is there a place that will exchange my subpar quality bills for higher quality ones. 
 
 I have a feeling the answer to my question is ‘any large Vietnam bank’ but I want to see if you all have better insight. 
 Thank you very much for your help and advice in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning a Bachelors Motorcycle ride for my brother in April of this year. There will be about 15 riders.
 We are starting in Da Nang and ending in Ho Chi Minh City in the span of 4 days, he gave me a list of must haves for this trip: Hai Van Pass, Rice Fields, and Swimming Spots. 
 Would love to get some recommendations on places to see, things to do, places to eat and places to stay.
 Also, where is a good place to rent motorcycles in Da Nang and return back in Ho Chi Minh (for about 15 people)

 Does anyone know a reputable breeder?
 I&#x27;m looking for small breeds like Pom, Bichon... specifically because I live in a small apartments. 
 Another question is, I&#x27;ve heard dog thefts are regular here. Is it safe to walk my dog outside? I live in District 2. 
 Also since I&#x27;m already asking questions, what would be the best dog breed for apartment life? That doesn&#x27;t need too much exercise...walking etc

                              <span>Hallo - I would like to recreate a trip I had in Viet Nam a long long time ago - Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi - but I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble trying to find a few of the places I visited before. If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it. I have most of the journey mapped out but there&#x27;s not much english language travel out there for Thanh Hoa so it&#x27;s hard to find exactly where they are. 
 I remember going to 1) a tourist destination of a river with a lot of fish, and 2) a medium/large busy indoor/outdoor market on the way to Sam Son which had amazing pho and lots of street food. I don&#x27;t remember and apparently didn&#x27;t write down anywhere the names or specific locations of either of these places and google isn&#x27;t helping me. I would love to know if these places still exist and if so exactly where they are :D Any help would be very appreciated, thank you!

                              <span>I’m currently in HCMC and am flying home on Thursday from Hà Nội. I’m assuming that due to new year, the flights direct are both expensive and almost non existent.
 Flight searching tools show most routes stop off at Phu Quoc. On my final day before going to Hà Nội, should I get an early flight to Phu Quoc, spend the day there (with my luggage which could be a pain) and then fly later into Hà Nội. Or am I better off getting flights closer together and spending less time on the island? 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated

                              <span>Xin chao! It is a long time since I were last in Vietnam. I will be here for Tet and I have bought some red envelopes. 
 I would like to give some families/children of families I know some good luck Tet money. Please advise an appropriate amount per envelope / per family for this.
 Also, I believe there is something like a moon cake made from gelatinous rice or mung bean than that is also very traditional. 
 Please advice the name so I can buy.

                              <span>I&#x27;m Filipino so I have an inkling that we have similar cultures in terms of meeting elders and what not. What should I bring as a gift? I was thinking a Filipino desert but I can also just do a fruit basket.
 How would I address his parents? With Mister and Missus? Or is there a specific term? They are pretty traditional according to my BF, but he isn&#x27;t close to them. 
 I want to put my best foot forward.

                              <span>We&#x27;re planning to visit Vietnam in late march for a couple of weeks, we want to spend a week in Hanoi and a week in Ho Chi Minh. I&#x27;d kind of rather play things by ear when we get there, book our flights and hotels now and then when we get there do some things like river tour or an overnight cruise. But I&#x27;m not sure how crucial it is to book those things in advance. When we get there, can we talk to the hotel about booking a cruise or a guided tour or will it be difficult to locate those with short notice?

                              <span>Does anyone here have experience with having shipped a suit from Hoi An with one of the tailors here? If so, do you pay customs and duties when you receive it back home? I’m wondering if I just deal with it and carry a few suits for the next 3.5 months, or if it makes sense to pay the shipping to Canada and then potentially pay the customs and duties on it. 
 I’m not sure how the process works, but it seems like this can be quite an expensive endeavour. Any advice would be appreciated! 
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;ve heard the word rabbit in mandarin sounds like the word cat in Vietnamese but I&#x27;ve also heard folk tales about how the Cat tricked the fast rabbit that the banquet was somewhere else so the cat took its place.
 Just wanted to hear people&#x27;s story so I can share.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m currently planning on a trip to Vietnam and thinking through transportation around the city- specifically grab availability to and from my hotels to the airport. Some of my hotels do offer airport transportation, but I can&#x27;t figure out if their quoted prices are a serious upcharge compared to Grab.
 I&#x27;ve been to other countries before where ride share apps are available, but cars are limited (eg, it takes 30-40 minutes to get a car and the car cancels multiple times.) Is this a cause for concern with Grab in Vietnam?
 Hoping to ask for your insight about transportation and the reliability, availability, and pricing of Grab in:
  
Saigon Airport to District 3 around 11pm: Are cars available at this time? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
 Hanoi airport to old town: I believe I&#x27;ve read on a Reddit thread that the car picking you up is not the one the app promised. Is this still the case? What would the pricing be?
 Halong Bay port to Van Don Airport: This is the one I&#x27;m worried about the most. Is Grab availability quick here? If not, does anyone have recommendations on how to get to the airport? Any companies you use that you recommend?
 Da Nang Airport to Hoi An: Are grabs available and reliable here? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
  
As a female, my primary concern is safety, reliability, and flexibility. Our group is 3 people: will this change the type of car we need for Grab?
 Thank you so much for any insight you can give on any of these cities and your experiences in transportation here! I really really appreciate it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been travelling around Vietnam as a foreigner and it&#x27;s killing me how there are so many elderly walking around working. Some to the point of collecting recyclables.
 Does anyone have thoughts on what can I do to help and raise awareness? There&#x27;s a stigma going on to not help them for fear of scams or something but wth... they are doing what they are doing because they need the money or it&#x27;s their livelihood. 
 What&#x27;s especially bothering me are the tourists! Like what are you doing bargaining with the locals? You have the privilege and luxury of travelling well and stuff, paying a little extra and giving them a better life. 
 Sorry, I was venting a little bit back to the topic, what can I do to help? I&#x27;ve been giving money here and there and it&#x27;s endless. I&#x27;m buying stuff I don&#x27;t need and I don&#x27;t know what to do.

                              <span>Hello!
 So, I&#x27;m suffering from misophonia. Misophonia basically means you react extremely sensitive to some sounds. Not just - I don&#x27;t like that sound - but full on rage / anxiety / panic / fear / aggression triggered immediately upon being subjected to it. It can be conditional though - meaning a sound only triggers that reaction in some context but not in others.
 Sounds like that for me are bass from music (no problem with bass from music I hear myself or when going to a night club but when trying to sleep f.x.). People smacking while eating. 
 Now - why do I direct this question specifically at Vietnamese people and not expats or tourists reading this? Well, Vietnam is a very loud culture and to make things worse sound proofing of buildings here doesn&#x27;t seem to exist. At least I have never &quot;seen&quot; any. Windows especially are always leaking air and because of that sound from outside.
 So, I&#x27;d assume that a misophonically challenged person would be suffering a lot. But, is misophonia even a problem here? Maybe being subjected to very loud sounds all the time since birth provides immunity to it? Do you know of Vietnamese misophonics - are you one yourself? What are your triggers? How do you cope? How do you arrange yourself with it?
 Cheers

                              <span>Hello, we&#x27;re visiting Dalat in February and I&#x27;m planning to visit a coffee farm after landing at the airport. 
 What is the best coffee farm with nice views in the morning, on the way between the airport and Da Lat?
 And what hiking trails do you recommend for awesome views with clouds in the morning, especially if there are some flowers on the fields?
 Do you recommend hiring a driver or simply taking a Grab?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a 1.5 year old who I’m trying to teach some Vietnamese. She currently learns a ton of classic American songs like, “Wheels on the Bus” or “Old Macdonald”. I’ll usually look for the Vietnamese version but it’s just not the same. 
 Are there any classic or kids songs that y’all can recommend?

                              <span>Would it still be worth to do the loop via car instead of motorbike? Anyone have a recommendations for good tour companies? I’ve seen QT and Jasmine mentioned a lot, but after reading reviews, I don’t think they’re the right fit for me. I prefer a small group vs going in a tour with 30 riders
 Side question: are tips expected for tours in Vietnam? I will also be doing son doong cave expedition and wondering if I should tip

                              <span>Hello everybody, my wife and I booked a flight from Vientiane to Hanoi for January 15th through 12go.asia. I made a dumb mistake and put in the wrong last name, her birth name instead of the name she has now after the marriage. After being in contact with support from 12go.asia, they informed me that you have to request the change at least 3 days before departure date. I know it was my mistake but I just can&#x27;t believe that you can&#x27;t change something like this before the flight. Does anybody have experience with this? Could we just show up at the airport and try to change it there? Would we have to cancel the whole booking or could we just buy a new ticket for her and I could keep my booking, even though I made a booking for 2 people? Thanks in advance in case anybody could give me information on this!

                              <span>I’m visiting Hanoi for the first time next week! I’ve heard that it’ll be pretty cold there right now. 
 Can I survive with a jacket/ cardigan or do I need a thick coat?

                              <span>Tesla has recently decreased its Model Y prices from $66,000 to only $53,000 and the Model Y Performance now starts at only $57,000 with a 0-60 time of 3.5 seconds and 303 miles of range as well (down from 330 miles on the Base Model Y). With the Vinfast VF 8 still starting at $59,000 despite having less track record than Tesla, what do you now think of the Vinfast VF 8 and what are your opinions of Vinfast now, given the fact the Tesla Model Y is now cheaper (in fact, the 7-seat interior on the Model Y is only $4000 more than the 5-seat interior)?
 I am also curious who would buy the Vinfast over the Tesla Model Y, if any, outside of Vietnam, and what measures Vinfast would need to address to succeed, or they would fail regardless?
 For me, I do think Vinfast should just halve their price to be competitive:
 The Vinfast VF 8 could be $29k trying to steal market share from the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5/CX-50, Hyundai Santa Fe/Tucson, Kia Sorento/Sportage, Nissan Rogue, Mitsubishi Outlander, Subaru Forester, etc.
 The Vinfast VF 9 could be $42k trying to steal market share from the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Mazda CX-9, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Nissan Pathfinder, Subaru Ascent, Chevy Traverse, Ford Explorer, etc.
 I am actually Vietnamese by the way, born in Vietnam and currently living in the US and after seeing Tesla prices drop, if I had to choose between the Tesla Model Y and the Vinfast VF 8, I would choose the Tesla Model Y Long Range. Also, a review of the &#x27;quirks and features&#x27; of the Vinfast VF 8 will be coming soon as I am heading to Montreal this weekend to film a video over at the Vinfast store.

                              <span>I heard this Vietnamese insult it literally translates to &#x27;I&#x27;m your father&#x27; in English. Of course, it has the figurative meaning of &#x27;I slept with your mother&#x27;.
 Does anyone know what the expression is?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I am currently working on writing a novel in which one of the main characters is Vietnamese-American. He was raised in a family culture that is supposed to be relatively traditional as per Vietnamese values and lifestyle, so I&#x27;m trying to do some research into what that looks like, especially in everyday life.
 So here&#x27;s my question: are there any particular details or things I should include to make traditional Vietnamese life feel accurate and respectful? Are there any potentially harmful stereotypes I should avoid? I want to get a more direct authority on the subject than decades old library books and internet articles. Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>1) assuming they have a US drivers license without a motorcycle endorsement.
 2) assuming they have a US license with a motorcycle endorsement.
 Both assumptions would be for a TEFL teacher on a proper visa. I tried searching but I get confused by the conflicting responses (some of which talk about taking a written Vietnamese test).

                              <span>Hi all. Question. I&#x27;m working in a team with people from Viet Nam. Two of them are getting married. My employer wants to know what would be a suitable wedding present in Viet Nam. We are thinking about giving them a bonus of 5 million VND, but what do you think: is that a good ammount, too little or too much? Or is it in general not done to give money for a wedding?

                              <span>I am looking for stereotypical Vietnamese music that features drawn out vocals and it is sang by a guy singing outside in public. I heard this from a taxi driver playing it in his car on youtube. I think it is not something the young would like. It is also not traditional super old music. I struggle to find anything like it.

                              <span>Hi R/Vietnam,
 My girlfriend is Vietnamese, and is not able to travel to her relatives this year for the new year celebration. We live in the United States.
 I visited her family last year to celebrate, but everything was new to me. Money exchange, meals, etc.,
 I want to try and find some items or typical celebratory treats or decorations to help make her feel a little less depressed about missing her family this year. 
 Any suggestions of items i could purchase or meals that are customary? 
 Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
 Thanks

 Facebook basically ate up every chat log and every low res videos that provided zero context whatsoever, then people started taking it on Reddit and Twitter. I&#x27;ve never laugh so hard on such a clownfest. Heck, I can even pretend to leak a Zalo chatlog saying &quot;Oh I&#x27;m a relative of the two students on the press conference today, they were forced to answer in favor of &quot;the upper people&quot; &quot; and people would gobble them up like a bowl of warm soup.

 Never change, fellow Vietnamese netizens, never change...

 I want to clarify that I do not wish to spread misinformation, but it is important that we put pressure on the military school, the university itself (HUFLIT) and the media to be fully transparent about the situation.
 Many posts on Facebook and Twitter related to this have been removed after the incident blew up on social media.
 According to an official statement in a press conference from the military school, this incident was a conflict between female students, with one of them accused of stealing, causing her to breakdown and scream. Later on, her family came to pick her up.
 There are also 2 female students present at the conference: one of them filming the video and the other one being the suppo…</span>

 I am staying in Da Nang for 3 months and I would like to rent a western motorbike long term.
 Most shops only have the „classic“ vietnamese motorbikes.
 I am looking for something like a Honda Rebel or Honda CBR.
 Do you guys know any shops that have them?

                              <span>While it&#x27;s a heartbreaking and frustrating story, I found a lot of suspicious things about it.
  
Why is there no name mentioned in the story? I mean not just the confession but all the messages, voice chats and videos that are claimed to be related to it. Isn&#x27;t that too strange? Especially when some claimed one of the supposed victims is well known by many people and has a father who&#x27;s a general. How come her name not mentioned even once?
 
The details of the story changed by a lot. Initially it was claimed that a teacher was passing by before discovering the incident and saving the girls (there was a suprisingly lack of details on how he confronted the rapists and saved the girls). Then somehow the story changed from 2 girls being caught on the road to being brought into a room by an off…</span>

                              <span>Unfortunately it seems it will be taking and cold during my key days in Da Nang. Wondering whether it would be worth changing my flights and perhaps spending time in a different city. 
 Quite disappointed as I was hoping to spend time at the beach, Marble Mountains, etc. Now it looks like it may not be possible, but not sure about accuracy of forecast. 
 Any thoughts? Thank you

I tried to talk to my mom about it but her respond was...not the best. I need help and advice, any drop-out or someone who used to be in the same situation can point me the way? (My English is kinda wonky because it&#x27;s like 5AM and i&#x27;m still studying for the upcoming exam)
 I&#x27;m Vietnamese, with very strict parents who decide my whole future and I&#x27;m not allowed to work so I&#x27;m financially depending on them.

                              <span>This is kind of a very niche situation but I figured I&#x27;d ask here. My Fiancée and I are looking to get married in Japan. We&#x27;re both foreigners: I&#x27;m American while she&#x27;s Vietnamese. The process requires a lot of paperwork most of the difficult part coming from her side.
 We&#x27;ve run into a snag where it seems her local Vietnamese government is asking for documentation about me before issuing the documents she needs from them. Though according to her my documents aren&#x27;t required and it&#x27;s just the government being stupid.
 Does anyone here have experience getting the Giấy xác nhận tình trạng hôn nhân and Giấy xác nhận chưa thụ lý đăng ký kết hôn when marrying a foreigner? Did you need documents for them in order to get these documents?

 she was r*p* by 12 male soldiers from military camp, not male students and this is 100% not unprecedented, many similar cases occurred before but have been concealed by Vietnamese officials, including Ministry of Defense
 This is actual the call for help of many students, undergraduates are studying in Vietnam, so many information and images we&#x27;re saving in the public drive. Just want to send to as much as anyone can see for this DISGRACE.

                              <span>I am looking for Vietnamese Karaoke Music as i am organising our next work party. My Chef is from Vietnam and (of course) a huge karaoke Fan. He is about 60 Years old and prefers classics from the 90s/80s/70s. Could you recommend me any songs so I can suprise him with my music choice?

                              <span>[TW - rape, suicide]
 Recently there have been stories on Vietnamese Facebook about female students being supposedly raped by other male soldiers at a military school, where they had to go and stay 2 weeks for military training (which is compulsory for most university students in Vietnam). After the assault, there has also been rumors that 2 of them has attempted to commit suicide, with 1 of them successfully killing herself.
 The first video is the screams during the incident. When the girl screamed for help, it could be heard that one of the guy shouted &#x27;Banh rộng chân ra&#x27;, which roughly means &#x27;Spread your legs out&#x27;.
 The second one is the body being carried away after one of the students committed suicide.
 After the stories went viral on Facebook, the military school published a notice about the subject passing it off as &#x27;internal conflict&#x27; and that &#x27;no harm was caused&#x27;. The official Facebook page of the university (HUFLIT) has posted this document on their offical pages.
 Other images are messages from the fellow students at the school.

                              <span>I love history and I have been living in Ha Noi for 5 years. I recently found out that Ha Dong used be part of a now defunct province called Ha Tay which was absorbed by Ha Noi in 2008 creating the city we know today. I often drive through Nguyen Trai street to Ha Dong and I often wonder what was the actual border between the two cities prior to 2008? Its hard to tell since most of the area between Ha Noi and Ha Dong has been built up over the years.

                              <span>Hello! I have been trying to do my part in learning about Tet. I really love the culture. I was invited this year to go on a trip with my husbands family (who moved here along with my husband from vietnam only a few years ago), to participate in a more cultural lunar new year than their typical. They live in america, and since moving here they just stay home for the holiday. It seems that they are very excited to go on this trip, and i want to show my appreciation in any way possible. There is a strong language barrier between us, we mostly only communicate through my husband. I am wondering, what are some possible gifts i can bring them to show them my appreciation? I have done my research, but as an outsider i do not want to overstep and i feel a little insecure about giving them traditional gifts. I need to know if this is just me. For example, would it be overstepping if i wore a red dress? Or would it excite them that i want to participate like that? Would i be weird if i brought them lucky flowers? Any insight at all would be very appreciated :)

                              <span>I like history, and I also know that the war waged in Vietnam is one of the biggest tragedies in the 20th century. Recently I came to know about a documentary about it made by Ken Burns. I want to know if someone here watched it and what is your opinion on that documentary.
 Edit: I think it&#x27;s somewhat stupid to say &quot;Vietnam War&quot;. Sounds like the fault is yours.

 We are thinking on making the Ha Giang Loop with a group of people (renting motorbikes). 
 Do you know how we could find/form a group that is planning to go there in the same time period? Shall we ask at the rental location maybe?
 Thank you!

                              <span>This year will be the first Tet with my boyfriend, he&#x27;s Vietnamese and I&#x27;m white. He used to celebrate pretty heavily with his immediate and extended family when he was younger, but the whole family has since stopped celebrating like they used to and I want to start up the celebrations again with him this year since I think it could be really nostalgic for him. I plan to decorate and cook, but what about gifts?
 I know that traditionally gifts of money are usually given to younger members of the family, so would it be weird if I got him a gift? I just really love gift giving and will look for any excuse to get him presents, but I don&#x27;t want it to be weird if it seems inappropriate for this particular holiday. If it wouldn&#x27;t be weird, what are some possible gift ideas that would be fitting? He really loves white tea, hates sweet things, and is always appreciative of plants if that helps.
 I remember him fondly reminiscing on the fun of red envelopes, and since it would be kind of awkward to give him money I had the idea of using the red envelopes to make a scavenger hunt for him. Thoughts on this idea? Too weird? Brutal honesty is appreciated, I&#x27;m still learning but it&#x27;s hard to get an idea of what he would enjoy for Tet without spoiling the surprise of all my plans
 Thanks so much for any and all help!

                              <span>I’m specifically trying to find a place in Saigon where I can practice my apnea (breath hold). This involves me lying face down in the water (using a snorkel and mask). Of course this will look odd to anyone who isn’t familiar with freediving and in the few instances I’ve had of actually trying this resulted in either getting shouted at by the lifeguard or they simply don’t allow anything that isn’t circuit or lane swimming. 
 How would I ask about whether I could do some freedive practice on the surface? My practice partner relies on me speaking Vietnamese for stuff but I don’t know how to say this.

                              <span>Our landlady lives on the penthouse of our building, and last year Tet we asked if it was okay to go up to her balcony to watch the fireworks on the eve (you can access the balcony without entering her house). She said of course, (I&#x27;ve tutored her daughters and we&#x27;ve visited together before). Afterwards they invited us in for drinks (it was just my husband and I and her, her husband and kids), and now she says they&#x27;ve had great luck this past year (good health, built a big new house, etc.) so she would like us to be officially invited for the evening this year lol. At the big new house they built. 
 Last time was just spur of the moment. I get a bit overwhelmed about the times during Tet when you do the specific things etc - I was just wondering if I should prepare a gift that would be &quot;lucky&quot;? She&#x27;s always been helpful and friendly to us, but I&#x27;d like to show my appreciation in a culturally appropriate way. For example, I only recently learnt that you can&#x27;t give certain flowers (the yellow chrysanthemum) as gifts, though luckily I&#x27;ve never done that. Would just like to know if there&#x27;s a &quot;special&quot; gift that would be appreciated. Feel quite honored to be invited to be the first into her home in the new year!

                              <span>Hey guys, going to be in Ho Chi Minh for ten days this January. I am a seasoned backpacker and really wanting great food and culture (for context I&#x27;m from Melbourne), I will also be travelling with my mum for a period who&#x27;s VERY Korean but want some nice experiences. Struggling to find a travel blog or anything online I&#x27;m really resonating so hoping this community can give me some insights. 
 Food wise I would love street food, cool bars, places where locals eat and drink, areas where younger tourists go to socialise, where young locals go to socialise. 
 Is it worth doing a few days elsewhere? 
 Sorry, I know i&#x27;m asking a lot but any type of response will be gladly appreciated. Much love!

                              <span>He&#x27;s the guy who was posting those &quot;predator hunter&quot; videos from HCMC. He seemed to be posting pretty frequently up until about 2 weeks ago when everything stopped. No updates from his Facebook page, and his YouTube account seems to have been deleted. I just want to make sure he&#x27;s ok. Although he was doing a good thing, it&#x27;s still a very risky venture in Vietnam. I&#x27;m curious what happened. Does anyone know anything?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I just like to understand a myth that I have been told by my Vietnam wife relative during my trip there in Dec 2022. 
 For context is, the relative open a chocolate shop in Saigon and it isn&#x27;t doing well. She commented that Vietnamese doesn&#x27;t like chocolate as much as coffee.
 Any insights to why choco is less favourable ?

                              <span>I will be traveling to Vietnam with my friends for more than a week in February. We will be staying in Hanoi for 4 days and in Da Nang for 5 days. We already have our stay booked in Hanoi, a cruise in Ha Long Bay and we have a list of places (mostly popular tourist attractions) which we would like to visit. I was hoping if you guys could give any tips and advises for our trip? Is there anything that we must see, any dishes we should try (I am aware of Egg Coffee, Pho and Bun Cha which we can get in Hanoi)? Is there anything that we should be cautious of (any scams etc.)?
 We are all very excited to come to Vietnam and explore it! Any advice will be much appreciated.

                              <span>Hello, I have a trip planned to Vietnam in Feb. Can someone point me to official governmental information on whether travel insurance covering COVID medical expenses are needed to enter the country. The tourism website has an infographic that states it&#x27;s required, but I can&#x27;t find anything elsewhere. 
 ​
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I have an odd question. One of my neighbors is Vietnamese, and we live in the United States.
 I&#x27;ve been noticing at night a red light in their living room. They do not have curtains. It looks like 2 urns? And some other things that I can&#x27;t make out. It looks like it&#x27;s in a case of some sort. And there is 2 red lights on at all times, from what I can tell. 
 I was thinking it could be for a reptile, because I was going to offer them some of my old reptile keeping items, but my husband reminded me that they are Vietnamese and it could be a cultural thing. 
 I don&#x27;t want to be rude by assuming, so is this something done in your culture? 
 Thank you all so much!

I ignored him as I was afraid of a scam, but I met him today and I wonder who this man is? Is he famous in Hanoi?

 I am going to Vietnam the 22&#x27;nd, and am very excited! I am however worried, since I only have one shot of hepatitis b vaccine and I need two. Can i get a second in Vietnam?

                              <span>Does anyone know of a prepared meal service in Hanoi that delivers to your house with a pre-arranged menu? I&#x27;m looking for one that offers healthy options (western variety food if possible) with a budget of 100-200K each meal with 3 meals a day.
 I did some research and found some options for HCM such as SmartMeal which looks pretty decent but unfortunately they don&#x27;t operate in HN, if anyone utilizes these services or has any suggestions I&#x27;d definitely appreciate it, cheers!

                              <span>We came to visit Ha Long Bay and will be doing a cruise tomorrow but are so confused by grand world. It is full of vacant nice buildings, a large market with nobody to buy the goods and I think we are the only ones in our hotel. Feels like we’re in a horror movie! What gives? Where is everyone?

                              <span>Hi! I’m travelling to Hanoi this mid March to spend 5 nights as my first ever solo travel! 
 I’m 25f, enjoys nature a lot, meeting people, and good food. I wanted to ask your personal recommendations on which spots I shouldn’t miss? From food, to nearby spots?
 The places I’m eyeing to visit are: - About 1-2 days in Hanoi - Hoi An - Ninh Binh - And Ha Long Bay.
 Questions:
  
Would it be good to spend 1 day in each town?
 What would be a good itinerary?
 Is Ha Long Bay worth it? Other towns you love?
 Food/ restos I shouldn’t miss in these places?
  
Thank you so much! ❤️

                              <span>Hello I am traveling to phu quoc with a group of friends for three nights. We are all around 30 years old. Found two places we really like. One is in duong dong town and the other one is in an thoi at the very southern tip of the island. Which one would be more convenient? We like to eat so does the west side have more restaurants than the south? We will be flying in but plan to do a boat tour to visit surrounding islands also.

                              <span>Pho is one of my favourite dishes. If it is not one of yours then there is something fundamentally wrong with you! I know its sensible to parboil your bones first to remove any impurities and get a clearer broth. However is it acceptable/correct to roast the bones first? This is pretty standard practice when making a broth in the west but I believe in doing things properly.

                              <span>On 08/01 Vietnam opened borders with China. What do you think about a possibility of the second Covid lockdown?
 In short, China’s epidemiological situation is awful, people getting sick and dying en masse, there are also new strains that they do not report to WHO.

                              <span>Hi there!
 I went out to the grocery store and some Vietnamese came to and told me he have some “pretty girls” and tried to show me some of their photos. I refused to him of course and went into the store but he took a picture of me and sent it to someone. It was very creepy! Has it happened to someone here? Why did he do that?

                              <span>We&#x27;re on a budget. Is it worth it to take that one day cruise to Halong bay? Or should we go dor 2 days 1 night cruise?

 Any suggestions for someone doing this for the first time and not wanting a pre-packaged supermarket basket?

                              <span>I just arrived at Dien Bien Phu and I’m heading to Sapa next. I also just found out, that there is Tet on the 22th of January. 
 -Which is the best place to be in northern Vietnam to enjoy the celebration? Hanoi? 
 -Any travel advice for these days? Does everything really close for the holidays? Do some of the tours/tourist attractions still open? 
 Thank you for the advice!

                              <span>What social/cultural/political developments led to Vietnam becoming less authoritarian than China?
 Vietnam has access to Western sites while China blocks most. 
 China cares about policing the internet more than Vietnam, and China cares about policing cultural works than Vietnam. Yes, Vietnamese movies have some serious censorship but at least they can still make ghost movies and homosexual relationship content.
 Vietnamese leaders can more easily accept criticism from their citizens while Chinese leaders are less tolerant of criticism. Vietnam’s security minister was criticized for eating at a Salt Bae restaurant in London and had to resign. In China, many major scandals are heavily censored and covered up.
 What reasons make the Vietnamese government less authoritarian and more humane than the Chinese government?
 If it’s a case of losing authority? Why is the Vietnamese government more prone to make decisions that risk their authority than the Chinese government is?
 Is the higher humaneness of the Vietnamese government stemming from cultural reasons?
 Vietnam is still repressive and has one of the world’s worst press freedom scores, but the fact that they have access to all Western sites and more political accountability is a clear sign that it is much less authoritarian than China.

                              <span>Hello all! I just got engaged two months ago, I’ve been thinking about getting a customized ao dai for both my fiancé and I for our wedding. I’m located in the US and was wondering how much is a customized ao dai over in VT? My mom is currently visiting Da Nang and she went around looking for ao dais and couldn’t find anything to her/my liking, she told me that the colors and prints are for the spring season or for tet. I don’t mind waiting since I’m still planning my wedding, I don’t need it right away but just want to look and find the print and fabric that I like. She also told me the cost for two ao dais are roughly $500-$600 US dollars, does this cost sound right? I told my mom I don’t mind paying for that price but she kept telling me that it’s expensive. If anyone has any recommendations for places for a customized ao dais I would really appreciate it!

                              <span>I am travelling to Vietnam soon. I don’t want to carry lots of 500,000 notes, especially when just buying street food. 
 What notes do cash machines give, say on a 1,000,000 withdrawal?
 Is there anyway to get smaller notes (20k, 50k, 100k)?
 Thank you

                              <span>I was reading some articles about the history of Vietnamese sovereignty on South China Sea islands and I noticed something odd. These articles only talk about how South Vietnam affirmed and exercised its sovereignty on the islands, but they don&#x27;t say anything about what North Vietnam did, not even lips service. Did North Vietnam do or say anything?

                              <span>Hey guys, so I’m travelling to Vietnam next week and there are some things I’m worried about. 
 I’m currently on medication and I’m curious if I’m allowed to bring that into Vietnam? Do I need some kind of receipt or certification from my doctor to prove that the medicine belongs to me? I’m scared they’ll seize it at the airport.
 I’m also a very physically active person, and I plan on working out while I’m in Saigon. I’m taking creatine, and I have been pretty consistent with it so I don’t wanna stop now. I want to bring it to Vietnam but I’m a bit nervous. It’s a white powder. What if they think it’s cocaine and they confisticate it? But I’m guessing they have trained dogs for that?
 Maybe I’m taking this too seriously. I’m on vacation and I should enjoy it, and not think so much about the gym. What do you guys think?

                              <span>I’ve lived in Hanoi for around 5 months. I have thick hair, but it constantly falls out now. My bathroom floor is covered in hair. I’ll run my hands through my hair and strands will come out. I lived in the US before this and never had hair issues. I use a water filter in my shower and take great care of my hair. 
 Is this normal? Any tips?

                              <span>I am trying to recall some of the stuffs I have read during this period of time. Some of the literature was of Viet origin. But some wasn&#x27;t. I finally remembered series like Animorphs, Ngũ quái Sài Gòn, etc.
 In particular, I recalled reading some teen mystery/detective book. I could have been written before the 90s. But I remember reading it in the late 90s to either 2000/2001. There is not much more to go on. Outside of the fact that I know it isn&#x27;t Sherlock Holmes, Detective Conan, or TKKG (another series that I was searching for). Hope you guys can help. Thank in advance. I am sure there should only be a handful of series and or books about teenage detectives during this time.

                              <span>Hey forum! I’ll be travelling Vietnam and it’s neighbouring countries on a motorcycle for a couple months and currently finalising some approximate financial figures. To those of you who have done something similar or “in the know”, how much should I budget for motorcycle maintenance/reparations? FYI, I’ll most likely be travelling on a Honda wave 110 or future 125, averaging approximately 150km/day for shy of 120 days.

                              <span>Planning on visiting the country Wed Jan 25-Feb 6. Planning on hitting Hanoi, Ban Gioc waterfall and surroundings, Halong Bay, and Hue/Da Nang/Hoi An. The timeline seems a little rushed, and it would be nice to leave the weekend before. Unfortunately taking more time off afterwards isn&#x27;t an option due to work deadlines, so it would have to be before. But since Tet is on Jan 22, would it be a waste of two days of PTO to leave on Jan 21 instead of Jan 25, since everything might be closed?

Jan 25-27 Hanoi ; 28th Hoi An ; 29 &amp; 30 Da Nang; Jan 31- Feb 2- Ho Chi Minh Also can you recommend some non meat restaurants to visit as we are all vegetarian. Thanks!

                              <span>I know that this is a very long shot, but:
 Do you have any suggestion for local independent or underground culture, especially in HCMC and Hanoi? Artist run spaces and collectives, experimental music (new music, noise, electronic, performance/sound art), cultural/social projects for local independent artists and musicians, queer communities, etc? 
 Although I won&#x27;t miss some obvious touristic spot I would like to see and support some of the local scene. Never been in Vietnam so I don&#x27;t know what to expect :) 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m in Hanoi with my fiancee and we&#x27;re looking for a USB C to HDMI cable so I can connect my phone to the TV at the hotel we&#x27;re staying at. I&#x27;ve gone to a few shops in the Old Quarter and came back empty.
 I&#x27;ll be away until Monday evening but would love if there&#x27;s a way to order one and have it shipped to the hotel on the weekend or Monday. The concierge at the hotel tried but was unsuccessful.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello friends! Next week I’m travelling to Vietnam with my mother and we’ll be staying there for three weeks. Last time I went to Vietnam was in 2015 so I’m pretty excited. 
 We’ll be spending the first week in Saigon, second week at my grandparents to celebrate Tet, and the third week in Phu Quoc Island. 
 There is one thing I’m worried about and that’s losing my phone. I’m worried about getting it stolen while in Saigon. It’s pretty crowded there so I’m a bit paranoid. 
 My phone is super important to me so I don’t wanna lose it. I’ll be wearing a fanny pack and I want to take a lot of photos and record videos while I’m there. 
 That’s also the problem. What if someone walks past me and snatches my phone while I’m recording? Or if someone on a motorcycle drives by and snatches it.
 When I was in Vietnam in 2015, I was just a child so I didn’t have a phone at the time so there was nothing to worry about. Anyone got some advice? What should I think about? 
 I’d also appreciate suggestions on nice restaurants and places to visit!

                              <span>What I mean is in terms of culture, the people or anything else, cause the usual case is maybe you move cause the quality of life is better but you identify with Viet culture more. Stories of foreigners who became enamored with our culture and love the country are often highlighted, but I wanna shift the focus on my fellow natives

                              <span>I see alters at my hotel lobby, at restaurants, billiards halls, everywhere. There are ones that have snacks and tea, and shots of alcohol, even ones with disco led lights. Which is super cool and interesting!
 I&#x27;d love to know why. Please tell me all you know about Vietnamese alters. Thank youuu🙏🏽🙏🏽

 Do Half-Day Hotels exist or am I better off just getting a cheapie budget hotel for a full night&#x27;s pay? Silly question but you never know what Redditors can offer up.

 Just wondering if there&#x27;s any good places to look into volunteering? I&#x27;m open to anything, just will have a bit of free time on my hands.
 But don&#x27;t really want to pay for the experience, prefer somewhere in or near Hanoi.

                              <span>What kind of clothes(jackets or cardigans)? Is it really cold in Hanoi? 
 
Suggest me some amazing clubs near Halong Bay or Da Nang maybe. 
 
I’ll be 2 days in Ha Long Bat, 2 Days in Hanoi and 3 days in Da Nang, what all should I keep in mind.
 
Some amazing adventure sports as we are a group of 6 guys travelling.
 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’d like to hear your opinion on the Future 125 vs the XR150 to travel Vietnam. I won’t be doing any off road trails and plan on travelling the north and venturing into Laos and Cambodia after. 99% of the time I’ll be travelling without a passenger. I’m 185cm(6’0) &amp; 75kg(165lbs); I’ll be carrying around 10kg of luggage. I’m leaning towards the future 125: It’s semi auto, lighter than the 150 and the parts are more widely available. Is the 125 sufficient or would you recommend the 150?

                              <span>Hi all, me and my partner are coming to vietnam in February and are pretty prepared, but still unsure about what vaccinations are totally necessary as there&#x27;s so much variation across different sources. We are currently up to date with Hep A, Tetanus, Rabies and Typhoid, as well as the usual vaccines you get as a child in the UK (Mumps, Measles, Rubella, Polio, HPV) Is there anything else that anyone would recommend? We can&#x27;t currently find anywhere that is offering Japanese Encephalitis vaccinations, so I&#x27;m also wondering if we will be safe to travel without this one? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I will be graduating this semester (in IT) and long term I would like to do a working holiday in Australia and after it work in Vietnam. The reasons why is that I want to become more fluent in Vietnamese (my skills are okay; I can say basic stuff but they aren&#x27;t great) and have the experience of living in Viet Nam. I do plan to travel to Viet Nam for a month before all of this. I also want to have experience with living in other countries. 
 I am not sure if I am delusional so please tell me if I am. I am taking italki courses as well as a Vietnamese class at my university.

                              <span>Is this a common thing in Vietnam? I admittedly haven&#x27;t been travelling a whole lot since the pandemic so haven&#x27;t been paying much attention to other places. But it seems a lot businesses have what look to be obviously fake 5 star reviews on google maps, far more so than other places (Mostly accounts that have only given 1 review ever). It&#x27;s hard to gauge what businesses are reliable, as it seems so many businesses do it, even ones that are &#x27;good&#x27; or have been around for a long time. I&#x27;ve also seen a few 1 start reviews that seem like smears, which may somewhat explain why businesses try to counter it
 Are there other websites people check to find how reliable a business is?

                              <span>Hi Everyone, I (30s F) will be visiting Vietnam for about three weeks this mid- February. I&#x27;m looking for a travel buddy for activities such as hiking, walking, cultural exploration, volunteer, eco friendly tour... if you are planning to travel around Hanoi and througout Vietnam during this time and want more company, please let me know. I will be based in Hanoi and ideally looking for day trip, or out of town 2-4 days then ilback to Hanoi. 
 I was born and grew up in the Old Quarter of Hanoi but have been living oversea since 19yo. I still have many friends and family in Vietnam. I just visited Vietnam end of last year so have catched up on most family/friends and gatherings. I also realized my recreational interests have changed now (probably due to age and living in NZ) and more into activities such as town/market walk around, hiking, walking track, cultural experience...my friends in VN will just take me to a cool cafe or new restaurant everytime and i have started to feel I have enough of it. 
 So if you are like-minded, I would love to hear from you.

In Vietnam is there a way to get near the Chinese ‘borderline’ (not the actual passport control etc) but just so i can say that i’ve been to the border and maybe take a cool picture without being in a vehicle having to actually cross the border? Just thought it would be quite cool. This could be completely impossible but was just curious, thanks

                              <span>hi! my mom is from rural southern vietnam, and my dad is from hue. i grew up in the U.S. and am pretty detached from my roots. i never learned the language, and most of my vietnamese friends are the same way.
 my mom made a comment last week that made me wonder about the regional stereotypes in vietnam. she said that she originally never wanted to marry someone from hue because she thought they were stingy and cheap with money. i can also tell that there’s many differences in food preference, accent, personality, etc.
 what are some other differences and stereotypes between the regions in vietnam? is there a difference between rural and urban southerners as well? my parents often joke about my mom is a farm girl at heart, so i’d love to know.

                              <span>I’ve downloaded the grab app to familiarize myself with how it works before an upcoming trip to HCMC and southern Vietnam. Currently in USA - the app map for rides doesn’t seem to load and I can’t see fares to get a sense of the prices to and from diff places in Vietnam. Does the app work, but just not work bc of my geographic location? Any feedback on how reliable this service is ?

                              <span>Currently in Vietnam, and I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of owl-themed cloth bags and wallets in the markets and souvenir shops in HCMC, Hoi An, and Hue.
 A quick google and subreddit search says owls and owl hoots are signs of misfortune/death... so why are they everywhere?
 I keep forgetting to ask the tour guides, so hoping someone here knows!

                              <span>Hi. (throwaway account for privacy purposes). I&#x27;m seeking legal advice. My company just dropped this on us (foreign workers) on New Year. I suppose they&#x27;re trying to cut budget (or encourage us to work more??). What&#x27;s your take on this? Is this even legal according to the labour laws for foreigners in VN?
 Please note: I&#x27;m not naming and shaming, I just want to have a better understanding of this so I can weight my options (either to stay or leave).
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I just returned home after 3-ish years in a god forsaken frozen corn field and noticed that there are now these yellow license plates everywhere. They&#x27;re on buses, taxis, ubers/grabs, trucks, etc. I also noticed that some of the yellow plates also have &quot;contract vehicle&quot; (xe hợp đồng) stickered somewhere on the frame or windows.
 ​
 What do these yellow plates mean? Are they like company/corporate vehicles or something? The one commonality I can find is that they are all work/commercial vics of some sort (as opposed to private/personal transport).
 ​
 I could have sworn that there weren&#x27;t these yellow plates back before I left. I&#x27;m almost certain that back then all the taxis, busses, and grabs still used the normal white plates. Did something change while I was away freezing my ass off?

                              <span>Hi everyone As the title suggests, I am loving my time in Vietnam, except for the bureaucratic headache of dealing with my lost luggage. 
 Simply put, on 26 December 2022, my luggage did not arrive, and I followed all the usual steps of filling out a lost luggage form, and notifying my original airline, JetStar. Of course, JetStar is blaming Vietnam airlines, who connected my flight from Saigon to Hanoi. I am now trying to submit a compensation claim with Vietnam Airlines, but all the resources point me to the general information and the form, which I have already filled out. My question is simply what email address do I contact/who do I send my claim to at Vietnam Airlines?
 I’m already past the 7 day notification period but given my deadlings with tracing and that I’ve been out of reception for much of my time here I’m hopeful I can shake them down. 
 Thanks so much.

However I have a really good job offer in Ben Tre and I would like to hear some opinions about living in Ben Tre as a foreigner who for now doesn’t speak Vietnamese (I want to learn but it will take some time tho)
 I’m aware it is a beautiful area of Vietnam but I wonder how foreigner-friendly is a not as big city as Saigon is and if the cost of living is higher/lower and some other aspects to take in consideration that you can think of.
 Any help is welcome! Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Some time ago I had dinner at a restaurant in NYC called Le Colonial. It was a high-end Viet-French Fusion kind of place. The dish I had was called Bo Sate. It was beyond good and I&#x27;ve not been able to forget about it. I want so badly to be able to make it at home.
 It was made with beef tenderloin (Bo), and had a sauce (Sate?) which included sweet potatoes and green string beans. My search for Bo Sate recipes only turns up Thai sate recipes, which is not the same.
 I really appreciate any hints or suggestions you can offer.

I was just wondering how come there are less honking in the traffic? Are there any new laws regarding this or what triggered the change? Just curious!

                              <span>Hi,
 I’m looking to move somewhere else in Asia after having lived in Thailand for 4 years. I wonder how it’s like to live in Vietnam in terms of access to international food like imported beef and other groceries, can they be found in the supermarkets there? How long does the visa on arrival last? Are the prices on food and living generally low compared to in western countries? What about transportation, is it advisable to rent a motorbike? Are the hospitals and healthcare up to the same or similar standards as in Thailand? Are fitness centres well equipped with modern machines?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a mortgage for an apartment that started at 9.1%. every year they increased by about 1 or 2% which I wasn&#x27;t so happy but it was in my tolerant level so I didn&#x27;t complain. Tonight I just received a message that this year it would be 15.4%, up from 12.9 from last year. I don&#x27;t have the contract right now but I will check later to see if this is even legal. I remember there maybe some thing like maximum increment of 2% a year. The bank is TPB btw.
 Is this a normal thing? Is the rate too high for current market? Is there anything I should do?
 Update: thank you everyone, this looks like a market thing. I hope everyone is doing well financially. These rates really suck.

She says we need to do another wedding in my country and her mom and family has asked her a couple times... Since when is double wedding a thing? I mean I don&#x27;t have no problem doing a small party in my country with my closest relatives/friends but there&#x27;s no way (as much as I love her) I&#x27;m spending 5 digits on another event. Westerners who&#x27;ve married a Viet woman, what is going on and why have you never spoke about this, ever. 😁🙏

                              <span>Will be in Hanoi last week of January. Didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s winter weather there. How cold is it really? Can you wear a t shirt during the day outside? How about during night or do you need winter clothing? Also if there is no heating. Does that mean the hotels / airbnbs are cold in side / uncomfortable

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a story in which a foreigner will be reading part of a Nguyen Trai poem in Vietnamese. The poem is Bình Ngô đại cáo. The passage I have selected is this:
 Nguỵ đảng hoài gian, cánh dĩ mãi ngã quốc.
 Hân thương sinh ư ngược diệm,
 Hãm xích tử ư họa khanh.
 Khi thiên võng dân, quỷ kế cái thiên vạn trạng;
 I have a two questions about this. The first is about translations. I don&#x27;t trust Google Translate and it&#x27;s hard to track down a good translation online. Can anyone help?
 The second question might be harder. I want the foreigner to mispronounce one of the words so that it changes the meaning to something kind of funny. Are there any words in there that could change to something silly if they are spoken with the wrong tone? 
 I can always choose a different passage if this one doesn&#x27;t work, but I want the content of the poem to be about war.

                              <span>Hey, I’m going to Vietnam, Pleiku and stayed there for about a month between March and April. I’m wondering if you guys have any suggestions and/ or recommendations things to go for fun or to eat. Since my Aunt has a car, I think she could drive us around in Pleiku. Also, anyone know international market around that province because my Mom wants milk for her coffee 😅. Thanks a bunch

Looking for recommendations, driver?, tips, etc. Since it’s a short trip for two amazing countries, please help list the must see/can’t miss spots. Cambodia will most likely be only Siem Reep/ Angkor Wat and will probably fly from NY to Bangkok and spend a night or two there. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Is there a “market leading” travel insurance company that backpackers and nomads use to travel around south east Asia? I’ll be travelling Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia on a motorbike. Although I’ve ridden motorbikes for many years and will be wearing the appropriate gear, accidents happen.

                              <span>To those of you who have already travelled Vietnam, more specifically the north: What’s the best way to manage funds? 
 Would you recommend carrying a lump of cash on you or taking out just enough for the week? 
 How available are ATMs &amp; how much are the fees? 
 What should I watch out for with the ATMs?
 Do locals only use Vietnamese Dong or do they accept/prefer USD, GBP, EURO etc? 
 How much cash should I bring into Vietnam?

 Me and my friends are planning to visit the following cities in the last week of January 
 Da Nang Hanoi and Ha Long Bay Ho Chi Minh
 I wanted to know what kind of weather can we expect? Is it a more jacket/jeans weather or can we bring along dresses, shorts etc?
 Thanks!

                              <span>We are coming in March and will be visiting Hanoi, DaNang, &amp; HCMC. I was going to bring two pairs of shoes: Vejas (walking shoes) for tourism activities and Tory Burch sandals (dress up for going out in the evening). Will this be enough or should I pack something different or additional? I am packing light and only bringing a carryon because of all of the travel.

However I have heard that it is monsoon right now so it&#x27;s not worth it I am leaving in less than 12 hours but I can cancel because I only just booked

 just meet here the other day - a game developer from Saigon.
 Was wondering - if there are indie game dev developers or companies here?
 Any gamedev meetings?
 On other note - I used to promote game development / indie game development. Maybe some universities would like to talk about gamedev with the students? Any way to contact Unis?

                              <span>Hello! Sorry in advance for my geniune remarks that might be stupid or rude, my intention is just to understand Vietnam better. As a foodie, I&#x27;m fascinated with all the food shops, restaurants, stalls in Hanoi. I noticed that most of the restaurants are generally 100% women-lead from cooking to servicing and to billing. Why? The rare exception I noticed so far are restaurants 100% ruled and managed by men, and these are thai-ish food related and generally by stylish men. Is there any sort of explanation? Thanks :)

 This is going to be our third time visiting Việt Nam. Until now, we mostly used air planes and trains. This time we would like to spend more time, so we would like to go in smaller steps to see more places. It seems the usual way to travel is by bus. How does the bus system work in general and after Covid? Is there one public transportation system or are there also privat companies. Would you also take taxies into account? When should we use which kind of transportation? Our route currently looks like the following:
 Sài Gòn -&gt; Mỹ Tho -&gt; Cần Thơ -&gt; Sài Gòn -&gt; Phan Thiết and Phan Rang  Đà Lạt  Buôn Ma Thuột -&gt; Tuy Hòa -&gt; Quy Nhơn -&gt; Pleiku -&gt; Kon Tum -&gt; Hôi An and Đà Nẵng ( denotes that the order is not yet decided)
 Our plan is to take the train where applicable.
 Though, this is only the first half of our route as we would like to continue our route to Hà Nội in a similar style for another 30 days, but we have not looked into it too much yet. We hope this is a reasonable route to travel.

                              <span>So I am back in nam finally seeing my fiance again after the covid stuff. When we sleep she insists we have some fan or AC on so that the room does not run out of oxygen? It does not matter where we are visiting or if the room has clear ventilation. I was wondering if this was just her or if this was some vietnamese belief sorta like the Korean fan death superstition. To clarify she truly believes we will suffocate if its not on.

 What is the technology industry like in VN? Are there opportunities locally or internationally? Do students study coding? etc.

                              <span>So we&#x27;re currently in Vietnam, heading off for some relaxation in Phu Quoc today from HCMC, but all the plans I had for thr rest of the trip are being rained out. We planned on doing Dalat, Mui Ne and Hoi An but the weather is terrible :(.
 We&#x27;ve already spent a few days in Hanoi and did Ha Long Bay, and while we love it we don&#x27;t want to spend another 9 days there after Phu Quoc (leaving on the 13th). I&#x27;ve been looking at Ninh Binh / Tam Coc as an option for a 3 day stay, but all tours seem to leave from Hanoi to that area, and everything I&#x27;m reading says to do that area on a scooter but I don&#x27;t have a bike license and my partner isn&#x27;t comfortable driving one on her own.
 Is finding local tours easy in that area?. Any other suggestions for the north of Vietnam?. We&#x27;re not the backpacking types, both middle aged and enjoy a certain amount of comfort :)
 Thanks!!!

                              <span>So, I came down from central VN to Saigon for the weekend with my family. We stayed in an apartment at VinHomes Central Park, largely because it was convenient to get to the NYE fireworks on the river. Like, a ten minute walk. Along with a large crowd, we waited for the midnight fireworks to start. 
 And waited... and waited... and waited...
 At 12:20, we gave up and took the kids back to the apartment. When we got back, I turned on the TV and loaded the live stream of the Saigon fireworks. Nothing but streams of people leaving the riverside.
 When I got up this morning, I checked the local news, hoping to find an explanation. One news site, VN Express, had a glowing report of the festivities in HCMC along with photos of the &quot;fireworks display&quot;:
 Vietnam rings in 2023
 This was the only reference I could find, so I&#x27;ve started the new year off with a mystery.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been digging around wikipedia APIs for a few weeks (learning project, making a website with trending articles from regional wikipedias) and across 15 different languages a single anomaly stands out:
 Since January 2020, the Đài Tiếng nói Việt Nam article consistently blows out all daily viewership metrics:
  
February 2020 -- narrowly beats front page with 32k views.
 
March 2020 -- destroys it with 50k hits over 30k
 
August 2021 -- 3rd after front page and Taliban
 
April 2022 -- dwarfs everything else with 81k views. The next non-special article is about a dude named Tô Anh Dũng has measly 11k.
 
December 2022 -- still going strong with a 2nd place after front page
 
 I don&#x27;t think it ever left top 3 for the past three years, no other article across the entire wikimedia comes even close.
 Is it tradition to read about Voice of Vietnam during breakfast, or did some popular site embed the article into their front page somehow? Any inside would be greatly appreciated 👐

                              <span>My wife (Canadian) and I (British) are going on our honeymoon to Vietnam, but intend to visit Thailand for a few days midway, before returning to Vietnam for the last portion before flying home. 
 The official guidance for British citizens is that 15 days single entry is allowed without a visa, then you have to wait 30 days till you try to enter again. I&#x27;ve seen claims that the &quot;30 days untill you re-enter&quot; rule isn&#x27;t really enforced and that you can just re-enter again on the 15 day rule, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to test that theory based on unsubstantiated claims...
 So my plan currently is to use the 15 days for the first entry, then apply for an E-Visa as soon as I get to Vietnam, print it somewhere, and use it when I re-enter Vietnam the second time from Thailand. 
 Do any British people have experience leaving and returning to Vietnam as a tourist in one trip? What did you do?

                              <span>My wife and I are planning to visit from Feb 7-16 from the US. We are super excited as we have friends who live in Singapore and said Vietnam is the best place to visit in Asia. My wife wants some beach time so they suggested these two locations. Our trip is short so we will only be exploring the area that we stay in. I also want nightlife and culture. Any advice is greatly appreciated :)

                              <span>Hey folks. Happy New Year!
 I’m looking for a track ID if anyone can help. It’s a song from early 90s. There’s a short rap introduction and then two woman singing. Hip Hop/pop and the video is filmed in HK i think. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I will be visiting a Vietnamese friends (don’t know them well) family’s house for a party next week. I’m not sure what to bring and whether or not it’s considered rude if I can only stay for 30 minutes. I’m not sure if I should even stop by if I need to leave so soon - I don’t want to make it seem like I’m not enjoying spending time with them. I need to leave early because I have a huge trip the next day.
 Question: What should I bring to their house and should I stop by if I can’t stay for very long?

 https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/VNM/vietnam/gdp-gross-domestic-product
 which suggests GDP per capita has increased 1000% since 1999. So just out of interest, has life got much better for you and/or your family over that time?
 I&#x27;m not biased, just interested in hearing inspiring or cynical stories, either is good.

                              <span>I come from a developing country that can be compared to Vietnam in many ways. But the main difference is the apparent tolerance of the state/authorities to informal businesses, eg street food. Are informal small business tolerated or encouraged ? Is there any form of corruption involved? How does the state collect taxes ? What is the size of the grey economy? How important is a business registration? 
 
Most restaurants, even small and apparently informal ones, have a PoS management software, and many print a receipt. I often see small business managers using calculators and apparently doing their accounting. Similar restaurants/business in my country usually don&#x27;t even have a logbook (combination of illiteracy and bad management). I know that Vietnam mostly got rid of illiteracy decades ago, but I feel that there&#x27;s more to this than just knowing how to read and write.
 
I mostly think of the vietnamese as one of the most industrious people on the planet. But on rare occasions, i meet people that seem even lazier than my countrymen, usually the younger ones. Especially in cafés, waiters seem incredibly slow and unprofessional. What&#x27;s happening here ? What am I missing?
 
 Sorry if my questions are ingenuous. I just want to better understand the vietnamese society.

                              <span>We are expecting a boy soon and have a hard time deciding on a Vietnamese name for him. Our family doesn&#x27;t live in Vietnam but has roots there, so I really want our child to have a little bit of his culture with him.
 Names we have considered are Minh Anh and Tuan Anh. Tho, I find Minh Anh to be more on the feminine side. 
 I like the two word names with Anh being the second one if possible (a family thing) , but not necessary. Any other suggestions?

                              <span>Hey friends, I’ve been interested in getting a Vietnamese passport or dual citizenship. What is the difference between the two? Can you get one without the other? I was born in VN and have my birth certificate but did not have a passport as I entered USA under my parents passport (5 years old).
 What do I need to do to get dual citizenship. Keep in mind that I would not be able to obtain any documents pertaining my parents as they do not want me to get dual citizenship. I have family in VN also.

                              <span>My friend in Vietnam always compares Ho Chi Minh to the Taliban. He just doesn&#x27;t shut up about it. I thought this was somewhat absurd and I stated matter-of-factly that Ho Chi Minh booted France out of Vietnam but he acted like that was a bad thing. His uncle fought with US soldiers and they were exiled to Singapore. He&#x27;s basically grown up in Vietnam though but he&#x27;s trying very hard to come to America.

                              <span>I (21F) have a Vietnamese friend (20) we&#x27;ll call F.
 We&#x27;ve been close friends for nearly five years. They&#x27;ve taught me a lot about antisemitism (they&#x27;re half jewish) and about Vietnamese culture.
 Recently, we&#x27;ve been getting into some arguments about their behavior and general attitude toward our friendship. I try to be as openminded and a good listening ear but I&#x27;m not sure how to pick out what is and isn&#x27;t &quot;okay&quot; for them to say. (For clarity, I&#x27;m autistic and I cannot for the life of me discern some things as excuses and others as real reasons. I err on the side of caution and take everything as a reason but recently I&#x27;ve had a gut feeling about that being the wrong approach.)
 Some things we&#x27;ve gotten into recent tiffs/disagreements about have been:

                              <span>Hi , I’m a Vietnamese , kinda outdoor guy , i travel alot sea fishing / camping . Everywhere i goes , even up in the moutain , trash by human are every where , those peoples go camping just pack their gear and leave trash there . 
 When ever i go sea fishing , the whole fisherman village is fully of trash , there is no trash bin , i tried to find one every time , but they said they dont have it , they said the sea is enless , so they dump everything in the sea . Year and year + 
 U can ask random high school kids here , no one care about the gobal warming , no one care the forest being chop down everyday for hotel / resort ( look at dà lạt / phú quốc 4 year ago , now - trash everywhere . ) . No one care about protect the nature &amp; animal eviroment . I mean wtf they learn at school ? It 2023 already and people still throw beer can on the street
 People celebrate new year , make sure u guy check the aftermatch in the working street. It alway a huge trash behind . 
 How u guy feel about this problem . What can i do for people to know the important of that ? I feel like im just a drop of water in the ocean . We need big change ?

                              <span>Hey forum! As some of you may already know, I’ll be travelling to Thailand in a couple months. My planned route will take me up north from Hanoi, more specifically NW,N&amp;NE. I’m staying away from the “tourist cities”, so I’m aware that a vast majority of interactions will be with locals. Apart from good manners and common sense, is there anything else I should know to stay polite and respectful to the locals? Perhaps a couple phrases in Vietnamese etc etc.

                              <span>Hi everyone! 
 I am currently working on a fiction novel series in which two of my main characters are in a queer relationship and one of them comes from a very traditional Vietnamese home. (His mother is Vietnamese.) I do plan on them getting married later in the series, and I have some general questions about how some of their traditional wedding practices may differ based on them being both males. I&#x27;ve tried doing some research on it, but I can&#x27;t find much about queer couples specifically. (Note, these characters do live in America, however my MC would like to incorporate his mother&#x27;s traditions into the wedding.)
 For reference, my MC (main character) is Vietnamese and his LI (love interest) is white.

                              <span>Hello! 
 I will be visiting Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam this upcoming Fall and was wondering if there are any local fashion brands that I should check out? I heard that it is not worth shopping for global brands so I am more interested in shopping locally. 
 The style I am looking for is casual loungewear/active wear, but looking for thick/plush materials that would not pill, fade, and is soft. I typically avoid any loud patterns or colors and enjoy more neutrals. Brands that I think of as an example of the style I am going for is PANGAIA, Gymshark, Alphalete, etc.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Just now, roughly 5-10 minutes before this post was created, I heard my neighbor doing what sounds like physically abusing and beating a dog. From what I can hear him yell, he broken something of the dog and did something to the dogs teeth, possibly causing it to severely bleed. The dog was wimping and crying very loudly as I can hear my neighbor with his wife and children messing up the dog. I live basically next door with the window right above his house. I need to know if there is any practical way of reporting him for &quot;Animal Abuse&quot;. There has to be some way to make him stop as I very much cannot stand the situation.
 Due to obstruction, the videos I have do not contain any images, but the auditory evidence is very clear.
 I live in Phu Quoc, if that affects anything.
 Please give advices, I am only a highschooler and most other members in my family seems like they won&#x27;t do much.

                              <span>Hello, overseas viet in hcmc on vacation. I&#x27;m looking for cheap souvenirs (keychains, fold cards, magnets, totes) for myself and friends. The prices at the central post office seem high so are there any good alternatives? I&#x27;m a little wary on ben thanh and am able to venture to other markets like binh tay if they are better. 
 Also, I&#x27;m looking to spend NYE in district 1 tomorrow. where would the fireworks be launched or the viewing area? also, any tips for tomorrow (crowds, preparedness)?

                              <span>I will be visiting soon from Bangkok for a weekend to Hanoi and am looking for any shops that sell local artists works. Not so much the stuff you’ll find in tourist shops but stickers, keychains, postcards and prints that are made by the youth and subcultures of Hanoi. Skater culture and coffee culture shops here usually sell that kind of merch. Even “cute” style designs I don’t mind. Just want to support young artists. I’m staying near the French Quarter and the lake. Thank you in advance.

I can&#x27;t help but wonder whether this beautiful and romantic trash is ending up polluting the sea or if there are measures in place to remove them beforehand.
 Somebody knows something?

                              <span>My 11 year old attends a Vietnamese school and is in 6th grade. She is currently not doing well having failed two math exams what I would like to know is is she does not pass her math exams throughout the year do they not pass her to the next grade and make her repeat the year over or do they make her do summer school to pass the math grade? Curious as the tutor we got her now seems to be useless in helping her do better. Thanks

                              <span>Hello friends, 
 What is your current job and your most recent previous job in Vietnam? What city/district is the job in and how did you land the job? 
 I&#x27;m curious for my job search what jobs and positions/roles other expats have and how you got it. Not to mention is it with a local company or international company? I&#x27;m looking to see how others went about getting their lives started in Vietnam
 If you have any stories on the timeframe it took for you, how long you&#x27;ve been there and what times you applied that were peak performance hours for applications for jobs I&#x27;d love to hear your stories! Thanks friends and stay safe!

                              <span>Hey forum, I’m here with another question! In two months time I’ll be travelling to Vietnam, where I plan on purchasing a motorcycle to travel south east Asia on. I’ve narrowed down my search to two models, Honda Wave &amp; Winner. I’ll be landing in Hanoi, where I’ll stay for a couple days sorting out the motorbike and logistics. Although I’m keen on buying one of these two models, I’ll buy whatever’s available to me once I’m there. My question is as follows: are there any well known websites, forums, social media groups, companies etc where travellers and organisations sell their/these motorbikes?

                              <span>I will be riding for 7 days and covering the northeast Vietnam from Hanoi. My route will be Hanoi - tuyen given - Ha giang (west and north/east)- Meo vac - cao bang - Lang son and back to hanoi. I start the road trip on the 2nd of Jan. Any one else riding around that time? I wouldn&#x27;t mind riding together or meeting up if you are around these locations. Also, for anyone who has done this before, any tips to make this trip a bit smoother?

                              <span>So I have been planning a trip to Vietnam soon, I had just bought a DJI Air 2s for videography and photography purposes. I&#x27;ve been reading online to see the drone laws in Vietnam but its all over the place, what do I really need to know about flying a drone? I saw that drones with cameras aren&#x27;t allowed but I&#x27;ve seen footage in air of Vietnam? Also, the process of getting a permit seems expensive and complicated for just a day of flying, do I really need it? 
 -cheers!

                              <span>Recently an American ESL teacher based in Saigon took to social platforms to expose the truth about the rampant sexual harrasment in a Vietnamese High School (Nguyen Thi Dieu).
 1/Upon seeing a female highschooler being forced to remove her jacket and inappropriately touched by a security guard at school, Teacher Kenny apparently stood up for her by using physical force against the guard. Kenny was furious and was asking for an investigation as this has happened numerous times before with other students. 
 2/There is CCTV footage documenting the guard being inapproprate with students in his office : forcing them to undress to check their nametag, inappropriate touching and groping female students. The school board forced everyone to stay silent and threatened to destroy Kenny&#x27;s teaching career in Saigon if he went on to draw attention to the case. The guard, on the other hand, only got off with a warning. 
 3/Teacher Kenny has since spoken up about the incident on many social sites such as Tiktok and Facebook, students who are former victims of harrassment by the guard are also speaking up and trying to gain traction for the case.
 4/The Vietnamese English teacher, however, is bribing students with exam points if they stay silent or inform her about the ones who side with Kenny on social media. She called students &quot;stupid&quot; for siding with a &quot;white westerner&quot;, threatened various UNDERAGE students for making tiktoks defending the victims and teachers. An adult woman who is an educator is going around spreading racism and threatening minors.
 Here&#x27;s a link to Kenny&#x27;s tiktok : https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS86jpE2w/

                              <span>Hello,
 I will be flying from California to Việt Nam in January for Tet and plan to bring many electronic gifts (like 5 laptops, 5 iPhones, 5 Apple Watches). I imagine the wise thing to do is just place all of them in a check-in container and pick up at the destination. I was wondering if there would be a problem if i placed a single laptop, watch and iPhone in my carry-on. 
 Thank you in advance for any advice.

                              <span>I know many of you have had lots of questions, and hopefully this will help. The news contacted me and asked if they could send out a reporter to interview me and go along on a catch. Of course, I agreed and did a 30 minute interview prior to the catch last night. The reporter asked many, many questions. Then, the reporter witnessed a catch first-hand. They&#x27;ll be writing up a story of their experience. I will share the news story when it is published. 
 I have no idea what her experience was or how she feels about everything. So, I will be just as interested to read the story as many of you. I answered all questions they had. I showed them several things that they were very curious about:
  
I showed all the chat logs where the predator always contacts me first. I never make first contact.…</span>

I tried two tour companies and they both said they didn&#x27;t have any tours that included the festival and it would be too crowded. Any advice or thoughts on attending the festival or best day/days to attend? Any suggestions on where to stay and transportation? Thanks!

Is the Suzuki Raider a suitable bike for several months of travelling around the country and its neighbouring countries? How much does a second hand one go for on the market? And finally, what are its main competitors worth me looking at?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I will be traveling to VietNam early next year. I have a severe seafood (more so finned fish, but contamination is a concern) and brazil nut allergy and I was hoping to get some insight into how I would communicate that in Vietnamese if I need to.
 I looked it up through Google Translate, but I find that it is often not very accurate. If anyone has any advice on pronunciation that would be helpful too, as I find that more difficult as a native English speaker.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to phrase it best either, so if anyone has advice regarding that it would be great. I am thinking it would be best to keep it simple, just something like &quot;No seafood/brazil nuts, I die&quot; or &quot;I will die&quot;.
 So far something I have thought of trying is to print out an allergy card with the information on it, but I think it may be good to get other suggestions as well. 
 Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone! I was wondering if anyone has tried the fried chicken at Lotteria in Vietnam and what your thoughts were on it. Personally, I&#x27;ve tried all the big international chains like KFC, Popeyes, and Jollibee, and I have to say that none of them hold a candle to the deliciousness of Lotteria&#x27;s fried chicken.
 The chicken at Lotteria is always fresh and tender, and the marinade they use is just the right balance of herbs and spices. Plus, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. In comparison, the chicken at the other fast food chains I&#x27;ve tried has been either dry or cold, or both. It&#x27;s just not the same level of quality as what you&#x27;ll find at Lotteria.
 Now, I will admit that the rest of the menu at Lotteria leaves something to be desired. The sides are pretty mediocre and the sandwiches and burgers are just okay. And the desserts? Well, let&#x27;s just say they&#x27;re not exactly worth writing home about. But despite all that, the chicken at Lotteria is still worth the visit (or delivery) in my opinion.
 So I&#x27;m curious to hear what others think - have you tried the fried chicken at Lotteria? What were your thoughts? Is it worth the visit (or delivery)? And if anyone knows of a better fried chicken place in Vietnam, I&#x27;d love to hear about it!

                              <span>Hey forum! Next year I plan on travelling Southeast Asia by motorbike. I’ll be starting my trip in Vietnam, where I intend to purchase a motorbike. I need help decided what motorbike to travel on. The vast majority of the time, I won’t have a passenger and my rucksack + gear will weigh under 10kg; I weight 75kg. I had two motorbikes in mind (“the Chinese motorbike” Honda Win &amp; the xr150. I’d appreciate if you leave your thoughts on these two mbikes and any additional suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I feel like most of them are such hit or miss. Some are okay, others are absolute garbage with most of the games not even working, even though they&#x27;re in a fairly nice place. (looking at you, Crescent Mall) 
 But I&#x27;d like to hear about your favourite places. I don&#x27;t care about the price lol

                              <span>I recently came across the song một đêm say. Fell in love with the song and immediately learned it. I like playing open mics and busking sometimes and would love to find some more gems to play when I’m in Saigon or working in California (in garden grove and San Jose a lot). I mostly listen to singer songwriter acoustic stuff, American folk, indie, and pop. If you can point me to some of your fav Vietnamese artists and songs I would appreciate it :).

                              <span>Hi all,
 We (my wife and I) are currently in Vietnam, enjoying the country thorougly and planning our next steps. In a few days, we’ll head to the middle of Vietnam, and after that likely to the South. 
 However, it seems the weather won’t be that good for the middle &amp; the south, especially in the region of Da Nang and Nha Trang.
 Also, Phu Quoc seems to get pretty rainy, which was basically our ‘end of holiday’ getaway. 
 Do we need to consider going abroad (say Thailand, Phuket - looking more stable over the course of 2 weeks), or are weather forecasts in Vietnam generally wrong? Would love to hear from you!

                              <span>Hi all! I’m traveling to Vietnam and have a severe shellfish allergy. Can anyone confirm if the following is accurate? I plan to show it to wait staff… I’m looking for it to say “I have a severe allergy. I can&#x27;t eat shrimp, crab, lobster, oysters, squid, octopus and shellfish. I can&#x27;t eat food cooked in the same oil as shellfish. I can&#x27;t eat sauces made with shellfish (like oyster sauce) or fish sauce with shellfish”
 Tôi bị dị ứng nặng. Tôi không thể ăn tôm, cua, tôm hùm, hàu, mực, bạch tuộc và động vật có vỏ. Tôi không thể ăn thức ăn nấu trong dầu như động vật có vỏ. Tôi không thể ăn nước sốt làm từ động vật có vỏ (như dầu hào) hoặc nước mắm với động vật có vỏ

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I am currently a student studying in US. My passport is expired soon and I would like to renew it. Can’t come home just yet. I have a few questions 1. Has anyone applied recently could let me know the exact fee to renew? Can’t find that info on the consulate website?
  
I swear I found an online link to upload my paperwork a few month ago. Does anyone know how can I find the link to apply online instead of mailing because I can’t find it anywhere now.
  
Thank you so much!

                              <span>I am Vietnamese on my moms side and there is a lot of drama between my family in my home country and my family in Vietnam over inheritances and what not. It has reached the point that both sides refuse to talk to each other. 
 However, much to my annoyance, my generation (those born outside of Vietnam) are purposely being kept out of the loop. It doesn&#x27;t help that I don&#x27;t speak the language and that my family just blatantly discussess all of this right in front of me, knowing that I can&#x27;t follow the conversation. The only tidbits of info I get are from eavesdropping on my mother when she is trying to explain the mess to my father.
 When I communicated my chagrin concerning me being kept clueless, my mom explained to me that in Vietnam fights are being kept isolated within the generation and that none of this will affect me, because I am from the next generation.
 Is this a thing in Vietnam or am i being told a bunch of nonsense? Personally, I would prefer to remain on friendly terms with my family in Vietnam.

                              <span>Hello!
 A friend and I want to go out of Romania, where we live, on a 3 weeks long trip, and Vietnam will probably be our destination.
 My simple plan is to fly to Hanoi and rent an apartment in the city center. After that, we could split our time between discovering Hanoi at a very relaxed pace and going on daytrips such as these: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293924-Activities-c63-Hanoi.html
 We are open to splitting our times between multiple places in Vietnam, or maybe cutting our time here short and spending a week in Kuala Lumpur or Tokyo, but it seems like a hassle.
 What would you do?

 My husband and I are travelling to Vietnam for two weeks in march as our honeymoon. We are flying into hcm and flying out of Hanoi. 6-21 march I was just wondering if there were any suggestions of a beach destination at this time of year that we could spend a few days relaxing?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I have about 1.5 weeks left in Vietnam until I have to go back home. I&#x27;m looking for some recommendations on where I should visit this time of the year, or just in general! I&#x27;m currently staying with family in HCM, so anywhere drivable is fine but I also don&#x27;t mind flying somewhere a bit further. So far I have been to: HCM, Sapa, Can Tho, Ha Long, and Ha Noi
 In the past I have also been to Nha Trang and Dalat. 
 I am considering Hoi An. Also would love recommendations for good night markets in the HCM area, or areas with great street food in general! Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello,
 I will be traveling with my wife and 3 kids (18,16,13) for 2 weeks in March. First time for my wife to come back to Vietnam after she left when she was 6 months old in 1972.
 I am hoping to find a driver for the whole 2 weeks who is willing to travel with us. It would be ideal if they spoke English but that may be a lot to ask? Any thoughts on the best way to find someone?
 Also, because there are 5 of us, AirBnb can sometimes be a good solution. Any reason not to try this route (for example, first 3 nights in Saigon we could get an apartment in District 1). Cost isn&#x27;t a big issue as I want to make this a memorable trip for everyone. 
 thanks in advance for any and all thoughts.

 Just scared for some random reason when I get there I get denied entry. I never traveled outside the USA before.

                              <span>Why are Vietnamese people like that? And then they enjoy their seafood from the same sea… And before you say it floated from somewhere else or some other bs.. Every day I see kids, families, couples sitting right at the edge of the park, eating foods from those styrofoam boxes and drinking their bubble teas. No one is taking their garbage with them to dispose of it.

                              <span>Hi! So myself and my partner are moving to Ho Chi Minh from the UK tomorrow and we are equal parts excited and nervous! I was hoping to make some friends whilst we are living in Vietnam so thought I&#x27;d post in here. We are 30 and 28 years old and we both love music, going to the gym and bouldering. I love gaming and can also play the bass guitar (would love to start a band actually!). We also both love food and going for a few drinks now and then. 
 Please message me if any of our interests align and you would also love to make some new friends! Would be nice to know we aren&#x27;t alone in the amazing country that is Vietnam!

                              <span>I live in a smallish town in the South, I am a foreigner and my wife is Vietnamese. I&#x27;m pretty embedded in my family and local community and I know that people prefer to handle things &quot;in house&quot; or without the police a lot, but I&#x27;m just at a loss.
 The house directly behind ours (their back wall forms the wall of our yard) has a woman who is an absolutely insane and abusive nutcase to her very small child, or maybe children I&#x27;m not sure. She screams like a lunatic and hits the poor child, which makes it wail this horrific wail I can&#x27;t take anymore. It&#x27;s honestly shameful I haven&#x27;t done anything yet but I just haven&#x27;t known what to do and everyone here has a very &quot;mind your own business&quot; attitude so I don&#x27;t know who to turn to.
 Last week I was afraid that I was listening to her actually killing her child. There was a pained screaming that only comes from death, and then it suddenly cut off to total silence. I remember though that lately I&#x27;d heard a puppy, I think she killed the puppy in front of the child. I heard the child sobbing.
 Who do I contact, what branch of government handles investigations like this? Besides the absolutely over the top regular abuse, I feel like if she really did kill that puppy in front of the kid(s) she may one day kill them too. I don&#x27;t know, I think maybe she has some really intense post-partum psychosis. Due to the layout of the neighborhood I&#x27;ve never actually seen any of them and I don&#x27;t know what the front of their house looks like.
 I&#x27;m very worried and I am at the point that I can&#x27;t let my moral cowardice get in the way any longer, something needs to be done.
 Can any Vietnamese people here help me? My wife doesn&#x27;t hear it because she&#x27;s rarely in the back yard and while she&#x27;s normally a very lovely person, I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s taking it seriously and may be worried about social blowback.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Is there a market or street where I can buy inexpensive bed sheets made of 100% cotton? And inexpensive pillows with goose feather? (I will only use it for 1 month- so don&#x27;t want to pay much. But needs to be 100% cotton)
 Can I trust the label/seller if it says 100% cotton? If not- how can I be sure?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I just visited Saigon in November for the first time. The city was amazing but I felt like I was not able to enjoy a majority of what HCMC has to offer because of the heat. 
 My question is…. Is it possible to get “used” to the heat biologically ? I don’t want tips on how to stay cool… I just want to know if it is possible for my body to get used to the heat if I stay for a certain amount of time. I tend to sweat easily and it seems like stepping outside of my hotel would trigger the sweats. Any advice here? On my trip I just ended up going to Da Lat and other cooler parts of VN.
 Thanks!

                              <span>First time visiting Vietnam in March and we will be doing 10 days in the north and trying get some ideas for how we can plan the trip. We want to fit in Ha Giang/Sapa, Ninh Binh, Halong Bay, and Hanoi in but the issue is 10 days is a little tight.
 What do you guys think about the 4 day/3 night option vs 3 day/2 nights for Ha Giang Loop? Is it too rushed to do the 3 day option on QT&#x27;s website? It allows us to fit Ninh Binh and Halong Bay in a bit easier but I&#x27;m a little worried that it&#x27;ll be too rushed to enjoy the loop.
 The other option is to do Sapa instead of the Ha Giang loop which will definitely make the itinerary easier since I think you can definitely fit Sapa in 3 day/2 nights in very easily.
 Thoughts? Are there any other places you think I should consider and bump one of the options I listed out?

                              <span>Hey guys, my wife and I are finishing our journey through Vietnam and would like to load off some of the warmer clothes we had for north of the country. I’ve checked DHL and the price is pretty much the same as the price for a flight. What are our other, preferably cheaper, options of sending some of our stuff back home? 
 Appreciate the help.

                              <span>This time, an American tourist was caught trying to meet a minor on Christmas Day. Unfortunately, this was also his last day in Vietnam. More than likely nothing will happen to him as he has already gotten on his flight back to America, but the good news is we will be submitting the evidence to his local authorities in New York where he lives. 4 catches in 4 weeks. 
 Be sure to check your children&#x27;s phones to see who they may be chatting to. I will post the video tonight at 8pm (local time in Vietnam). 
 Just like the other catches, this guy stays and tries to talk his way out of the crime he committed. It is illegal to lure a minor. It is illegal in Vietnam, the United States, and nearly every country around the world.

                              <span>Hello, My girlfriend is b12 deficient. Back in the uk she receives b12 injections every 12weeks and we are now 2 weeks away from that time. She has the b12 formula in capsule form from a uk dr that would need to be injected by someone here in Vietnam. My question is where would we go too get this done and how much would it roughly cost? Any help I’d appreciated thankyou

                              <span>Does anyone know what the deal is with these speakers in the neighbourhood?
 I’m currently residing in Long Hai at my wife’s parents house. I’ve been coming here for a few years. The speaking normally starts around 5 am. My wife said it’s some kind of government news message.

                              <span>Hello all,
 My wife and I are currently enjoying a cruise in Ha Long Bay, and contemplating about our journey’s next step in Vietnam. 
 We are definitely into trekking, and the idea is to travel to Sapa, either for a 2 or 3 day trip, to check the beautiful rice fields.
 However, the weather forecast says it will rain unfortunately, and I am not entirely sure if december is a good time to visit, since it may be quite cold.
 Would you guys recommend a visit to Sapa the 27th till the 29th of December?
 Would be great hearing from you. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello! I’m adopted from Vietnam. My adoption paperwork (I think surrender papers specially) lists my bio mom’s ethnicity as “Xinh.” Could anyone tell me anything about this ethnic group or point me towards some resources? I’m not finding too much about it on my own. Thank you!

                              <span>We are staying in Hồ Tràm for holidays, in a big tourist resort. On a Christmas eve Turkey dinner, there was a big group of people, who were (almost)all wearing white fancy clothes: most of them young and adult ladies but some men, children and at least one old lady. They were almost all wearing white fancy clothes: dresses, lacy shirts etc. Except the old woman was wearing something red &amp; some men had jeans or black trousers. They were also playing some games or giving speeches or something.
 In my culture white fancy clothes are usually something a bridal party wears, or on some other special occasion if everyone is wearing them in unison. I was wondering if this is a cultural thing for a special occasion, as they all looked more Asian than Caucasian, and asked our waiter, what was the occasion end gestured in their general direction (I think I did it discreetly) and our waiter was immediately super apologetic and kept repeating &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry&quot; and we were super confused, saying &quot;no need to apologize, it&#x27;s fine&quot; etc. and we never got an answer, what was the occasion, and we were left in confusion.
 My SO was giving me shit afterwards for asking it. I never intended it to be anything hurtful or insulting, as they were in high spirits and I think it is okay in many cultures to ask simply &quot;what&#x27;s the occasion&quot; when you see a group or family celebrating. 
 So if someone could guess what was the occasion and also tell me if I was an insensitive white biach.

 I have a non-Citibank (Mastercard) bank and want to make a withdrawal. Does anyone know what the withdrawal fee is at a Citibank ATM? Does anyone have any other bank that charge $0 or lower ATM fees? Thank you I’m advance.

                              <span>You may be surprised to know Vietnam has a wonderful cosplay community. There are several groups that organize events year round (usually 1-2 events every month). Currently, there is a Winter Convention Manga Festival going on; it was today and it will also be going on tomorrow too! 
 If you are into anime, manga, comics, and cosplay, then you should absolutely check these events out. I have been going to every event for the last 5 months or so. I film short videos (3-5 minutes) showing the cosplayers. I let them do a pose/action for about 5 seconds and show as many as I can. 
 You can find the cosplay festival videos by searching YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I have a &quot;Cosplay!&quot; playlist from all the events. If you see me there, I am always happy to include you in my videos if you want to be in one. I do it to showcase the cosplay community and let others know about this community in Vietnam. All the people who go are very kind and friendly. Those of us that dress up always allow people to take photos and videos. 
 Entry fees for most of the events is around 120,000 VND. Hope to see more new cosplayers in the near future. If you have any questions, just let me know!

                              <span>I am native and speak the language well. My husband and I have traveled to Vietnam many times together, visited many different regions/cities, we are very comfortable and love it there. Traveling as a young couple in our 20’s was fun and easy. This time we are taking our daughter and I’m suddenly so nervous 😫 Any tips/advice/words of encouragement would be much appreciated!
  
There is no law or regulations on car seat. We were thinking to rent a car and bring our own travel carseat from the US. Has anyone done this? Is transportation going to be a pain?? 
 
Is “high chair” even a thing?? We love street food and always sat on the little plastic stools…our 18mo will for sure just jump off and run lol. How do you handle a toddler when eating out?
 
Can anyone recommend some nice parks or playground in HCMC and Da Lat we can take a toddler to? (Please no Thao Cam Vien or Dam Sen…does that place still exist? Lol no idea) 
 
 Anything else relating to safety, health, food, sleep/Jet lag, that you have experienced please share ❤️ xin cảm ơn 💛

                              <span>Hi, I am in Saigon and my wife is looking for one of those &#x27;all over jacket things&#x27; to wear on the scooter. 
 I am probably describing it badly, but it&#x27;s basically a long sleeve jacket that goes all the way down to the feet with a hood and possibly even gloves? Head to toe. Like a scooter burka, but waterproof? 
 Any idea where we can buy one? Maybe one of the local chos?

                              <span>Can someone please suggest a good beach, or a beach hotel/resort near danang. My flight lands in da nang, we are planning to stay for 4 days and then fly out of da nang. We are traveling with a child, so hoping to find a beach within a 2hour drive from airport. (Initially planned to stay in da nang, but have been reading reviews here that untreated sewage from da nang being released in the sea. Would surely want to avoid it after reading)

                              <span>In our early 20s, my friend and I spent about 6 months living in Vietnam and we had an amazing time. My friend is turning 30 and their favorite snack there was the coconut pinattsu from FamilyMart. I&#x27;d love to send them some for their birthday.
 Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere in the US and the only options online have minimum orders of 1000 packages.
 Is there any chance someone would be willing to send maybe 10-20 bags to the US (compensated of course).
 Thank you!

                              <span>We plan to go to the Cu Chi Tunnels. I read that &quot;big&quot; people tend to have problems to get in there. I&#x27;m not really big but have wide shoulders due to sports. At 1,85 my chest size is about 115 cm.
 Anyone was there and can share their experience? (including Body dimensions would be best).

 Thinking of pulling up to some club right after I land in HN on 12/30, then spend the next week or so exploring the night life.
 I’m mostly interested in dancing so places like 1900 is out. Currently The Warehouse and Birdcage are on my list. Anywhere else I should look at? Preferably queer friendly and more underground.
 Incredibly down to meet up with anyone who’s going as well. Have my cousins here but I don’t think they like techno lol.

                              <span>Ever since I was in middle school, I self taught English, and before I knew it I started thinking in English in my mind. Nowadays, I have started to notice that I struggle a lot when I interact with people in Vietnamese, I always try to find the equivalents of the words im thinking and end up stuttering or saying something that I thought would convey what Im trying to say but dont? I only feel comfortable to truly express myself in English and sometimes, by reflex, I just think out loud or mumble to myself in English and probably make others think theres something wrong with me.
