                              <span>Hello, my father was born in VeitNam but was adopted when he was a child so he lost a lot 9f his culture. We are planning our first trip as a family there and I was wondering what things are a must do in order to experience the culture. I would live to connect to that part of my heritage so any suggestions are appreciated!

                              <span>Hi there friends, I (24F) and my partner (30M) are moving from the UK to HCMc in September. If anyone is able to offer advice on the following areas that would be really helpful!
  
What resources did you find were best for helping you to learn Vietnamese before moving? Textbooks etc.
  
 What are some rental red flags you&#x27;ve come across? We are hoping to live in D2/D3.
 I have moderate eczema and am curious about how a humid climate will impact that. If anyone in similar positions have found it easy enough to find OTC treatments?
 
  
To round it off if there are people in this subreddit that are also living around HCM and are looking to get a beer or coffee it would be great to make connections!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Visiting Vietnam in a couple of weeks, and wondering if I can get a good deal on a road bike. 
 Bikes are very expensive where I‚Äôm coming from, and it‚Äôd be great to have recommendations on bike shops/ retailers that frequently run discounts.
 Looking for a carbon frame with Ultegra group set. Not too fussy on the brand, but it‚Äôd be good to go with a Tier 1 name (Giant, Trek etc)
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Xin Ch√†o everyone. I am right now in Ha Noi and was wondering where to buy film. I will also stay in Da Nang for around 6 days. Is that also enough to develop some pictures ? How long would it take and what are the prices for the film and the development? 
 Thank you so much

 Why is that? Any idea? She doesn&#x27;t know and says my app must be wrong. But google translate does it the same way as the app does.

                              <span>So, me and my vietnamese wife plan to retire from U.S. and live in Vietnam. I know i pay taxes for withdrawals from 401k but does Vietnam also tax that income? I would have all of my Social Security and 401k payments put into my US bank and then transferred as needed to Vietnam bank. I&#x27;m just trying to get an idea on what my budget will be like after taxes and such on my 401k and Social Security.

                              <span>I‚Äôve been in Vietnam for the past couple of weeks visiting family and one thing that has been really difficult to witness is seeing how dogs are treated here. We passed by an owner beating a chained up dog and hearing its cries made my heart sink. On other occasions we‚Äôve seen strays and malnourished dogs locked in cages forced to sit in the sweltering heat. This is not to say ALL Viet people treat dogs poorly, but I do sense that maybe dogs are not widely regarded in the same way as back in the States where I am from. 
 As a dog lover, I find the dog meat industry horrible given what I‚Äôve read (dogs are stolen from communities and beaten/tortured/etc or unethical farming practices) but I know to some people it is just viewed as any other type of meat (beef/pork). My hope that this practice dies out, but I know where there‚Äôs demand, there will always be people who are willing to supply. This has made me wonder if the dog meat industry is still popular and how local communities view eating dog meat? Are there any hopes of this industry coming to an end?

                              <span>It&#x27;s a pretty hot topic recently. Some parents want their kids to study IELTS really early, like 6-10 years old. 
 Pros: Kids get to learn english very early which will most likely set them for success later on.
 Cons: It puts unnessessary stress on kids, kids can&#x27;t form an opinion about politics yet so the writing task is basically a goner. IELTS is not realistic; real life english is a lot less formal than IELTS.
 I figure if you use Reddit you&#x27;re probably better at English than 99% of native Vietnamese, so the opinions have a bit more merit to it.

                              <span>Whenever I make food that requires you to boil water/food (like pasta or chili), I usually set the food to boil on the stove then go do something else until it&#x27;s time for me to return. Despite this, every time I&#x27;m away from the kitchen for even a few minutes, my family will run into my room and yell at me that my food is boiling like it&#x27;s an emergency or something. And this happens with EVERYONE, dad, mom, grandpa, grandpa, aunts, uncles, cousins... on my dad&#x27;s side and my mom&#x27;s side... ... sometimes multiple times a day.
 This has been the case for as long as I&#x27;ve been cooking, 10+ years now. I can&#x27;t tell if this is a just an older generation thing, a cultural/Vietnamese thing or a my family thing??? I honestly want to know where this stems from. I&#x27;ve told my family that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m supposed to cook the recipe and they don&#x27;t need to worry about the food boiling but they still do it D:
 Does anyone else&#x27;s family does this?

 Also, regulations and such aside, can I expect to run into issues with local law enforcement for carrying a bow? I will be backpacking and it will be inside the pack.

Is there any way I can go up for free (it doesn&#x27;t have to be the top floor observation deck, I just want a good view)? Also, are there any other pretty sights to see?

                              <span>So, my wife and I have decided we are going to try to permanently settle in VN next year.
 I am an Australian citizen and my wife is dual Australian/Vietnamese. Since we have been saving for a house deposit in Australia, we literally have enough $$ for my wife to buy a plot of land and build a house on it in Vietnam, in the area my wife&#x27;s family lives. We want to do that, have a child, and my wife can potentially start a beauty salon in the local town.
 The main requirement for this to actually happen is that I need to be able to work 100% remotely. I am a software developer, and currently working remotely in VN (at the parents&#x27; farm) due to a very flexible company policy that allows me to work up to 4 weeks per year anywhere in the world. This policy is great, but obviously unsuitable for what my wife and I want to do. So the first thing I&#x27;m going to try to do is negotiate a deal with my employer - take a pay cut, work remotely, possibly fly to AU periodically (1 week every 2 months) to do on-prem work to maintain a bit of a physical presence.
 Failing that, I would need to find a remote job. We can probably afford for me to take a 30% cut and still live very comfortably. The trick is finding an employer happy for me to be 100% in VN (I&#x27;m prepared to be very flexible to meet timezone requirements), and possibly dealing with the tax implications of being a foreigner with a foreign job permanently living here (practically - I will be on rolling 5 year visa exemptions unless I get permanent residency).
 I guess my question is - are there people here (particularly software devs) who have done anything similar, and who have any advice about dealing with tax requirements, finding remote employment, etc?
 Any input appreciated!

 I&#x27;m a tourist myself but I would like a more &quot;chill&quot; place/vibe. I like more cozy bars, local food and i just walking around a city. 
 But i don&#x27;t want to be so far off the map where locals give you the &quot;wtf are you doing here&quot; face when you enter a bar or restaurant. Any area recommendations ?

 My 2 cent: Vietnam economy is rising, people are optimistic, they&#x27;re nationalist and would rather stay in Vietnam. The old stereotype of &quot;desperate Vietnamese fleeing the country&quot; is a 80/90s meme back when the country was really, really poor.
 People don&#x27;t want to move outside of the country anymore, aside from the poor region of Vietnam (Nghe An) who want to move abroad so they can send money back to their family.

                              <span>Hi guys, is there any German here who would like to exchange languages with me? I can help with Vietnamese. I‚Äôm Vietnamese (25f) and learning German at the moment. But OMG it‚Äôs hard. Even though Duolingo helps me a lot, I want to have a chance to talk with real people. Some details about me: - My German now is A1/A2, so basic. - I‚Äôm in Ha Noi but not in the center so I would like to do video calls instead of meeting in person. - I‚Äôm not a Vietnamese teacher (only tutored math for students in secondary and high school in the past) so I can‚Äôt provide you the lessons like a teacher, but I always try my best with what I do. - I also don‚Äôt mind about the timezone if you are not in Vietnam at the moment as I‚Äôm working for a foreign company so my time is messed up, so if you can only help me at 2am in the morning Vietnam time then that‚Äôs totally okay. I can do it. Please send me a dm. I would appreciate your help. Have a wonderful day everyone!!

                              <span>Recently, my new girlfriend and I went on holiday- me caucasian, her Vietnamese. 
 We visited a tourist attraction (not a pagoda or anything remotely religious) in a countryside city. Neither of us had been there before. 
 At this place, I observed on 3 seperate occasions older women staring a me then staring at my girlfriend for a long period of time and giving her a dirty look. 
 2 other women said something disparaging (i believe referring to her as a hooker), as did a young guy. 
 My girlfriend is quite pretty, but she was dressed very modestly - certainly not dressed in a way that was remotely provocative. We only have an age gap of 5 years. We are both friendly and curteous to people we are around. 
 I have never experienced this before. I made me really upset for us. How dare they judge us like that? Who do they think they are to say things like that?
 Is this common, or is this unusual?
 If it is common, how to best deal with this? I felt like accosting them and dressing them down for being so rude, but I did not.

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m heading to Vietnam in a couple weeks and wondering if it&#x27;s possible to rent a bike or join a tour or something where I can cycle down Hai Van Pass?
 Upon reseraching alot of the tours are cycling up it which I&#x27;m not sure if I can physically do. I&#x27;m 30/m/average fitness but not don&#x27;t think I could cycle uphill in the heat. Would prefer to go down the hill at my own pace.

Due to the incoming storm we were considering skipping both and flying out to Da Nang and then Ho Chi Min, as it‚Äôs outside of the typhoon path. It‚Äôs still raining in both those cities. I know its hard to predict anything regarding the weather, but does anyone have advice/recommendations. Flying back home on 7/26.

                              <span>As title, why are crypto always mentioned when someone ask about sending money aboard? Setting aside the volatilty of crypto (stablecoin isnt stable, binance is not infallible, etc etc), how can you explain the origin of that money? While it is not universal, im pretty sure that there are strict anti money laundering laws in EU/NA. Wouldnt you be forced to declare/taxed on that amount? As crypto gains is taxable.Also, wouldnt it takes a lot of effort to figure out how to do the crypto trading? As there are easier, legal means available (ATM withdrawal with Master/Visa), or plain old Western Union, bank wire transfer? If you want less fees, then there is also currency swapping. 
 Edit: i mean here in reddit. I have seen quite a few posts in here that have comments about using crypto as money transfer method.

 I am writing a Vietnamese-Chinese cookbook. I am curious and wanted to write about dishes and their recipes that have derived from Chinese cuisine. I am sure that are a lot of influences from them. Can you please list the dishes name in Vietnamese language and English translation.
 Can you also put in local links where to cook these dishes?
 Thank you so much for your help.

                              <span>Hi all you lovely people!
 I have a question, and I hope I don‚Äôt sound ignorant. 
 In the United States, the Vietnam war is easily the second most taught war (only behind WWII) in the 20th century. 
 The blunders, the brutality, the cost of lives on both sides (with an emphasis on Vietnamese citizens) , and whether or not it was needed to check communism (and if it had any effect in doing so) are all frequent topics in history classes. 
 So to the question - how is the war remembered in Vietnam now, and what‚Äôs the general consensus on the long term impacts?
 Apologies again for any potential ignorance, but the beauty of reddit is the ability to get information from people you wouldn‚Äôt normally meet, and this is a topic I‚Äôm genuinely curious about. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, Is anyone here familiar with ATM procedure? My dad forgot to take the card out within the time frame so the machine ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù it. Now, it‚Äôd be easy if the card is in my dad‚Äôs name. It belongs to my aunt, who moved to the US 8 years ago. It‚Äôs her retirement. (In her not so bright moment,) she authorized it to my uncle, dad‚Äôs brother, because he lives in HCMC where she got paid from. ƒê√¥ng √Å made them signed a separate form of the bank and kept it. Aunt and uncle don‚Äôt have a copy. They trusted ƒê√¥ng √Å bank when the bank said they only need the government authorization form. Now they wouldn‚Äôt let my uncle get a new card. Mind you, the card has to be renew every 4 years and uncle successfully got a new card for dad once. Now the bank did a 180 saying we need to find the person who filed the bank‚Äôs form or have the copy in our hands. It‚Äôs so ridiculous and we‚Äôre at lost. We don‚Äôt have immediate relatives working at ƒê√¥ng √Å so aunt will have to pay at least $1500 to fly back and sign the form. TL;DR: ƒê√¥ng √Å bank asking for a form they have on file to make a new ATM card

 - Both Wise and PayPal are unable to do this because they don&#x27;t allow you to pull money out of a Vietnamese bank account, they only allow sending money in from the UK
 - I found a service called Ezyremit, which is a Vietnamese fintech company based in Australia. Has anyone used this service before and how reliable is it?
 - Is there any other way? I heard that there are some banks that allow you to do this with low fee like HSBC or CitiBank, is that true?

 I am a type one diabetic and in Vietnam for the next 3 weeks. After a scary bout of low blood sugar/food poisoning I need help finding Baqsimi. This is a life saving emergency sugar that&#x27;s given through the nose. 
 I have tried three pharmacies (two local ones and one pharmacity.) I haven&#x27;t ran into anyone who has it, can order it or speaks English. 
 Every time I show the counter person a picture they just shake their head no. 
 Would anyone know how to track some down in Hanoi? Would I need to go to the hospital? 
 Please excuse my ignorance. I appreciate any help.

                              <span>So I spent a month completing the Pimsleur course for Vietnamese. Unfortunately, there is only 1 level for Vietnamese, where there is typically 5 level. I just came back from a 3 week trip to Vietnam to visit from family and the Vietnamese study prior to going really helped. Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do regarding studies, I liked using pimsleur since it has a structured course to work through and it gives a lot of practice for listening, speaking and writing. Should go back to the basics with grammar textbook or continue to more digital or audio courses?

Renew my Viet passport in Canada can be pretty expensive (CAD$300+) and I feel like I got scammed. I know I cant renew one in Vietnam and send it here by mail. Thanks!!

                              <span>I was talking to a few Vietnamese relatives of mine when I heard about a ranking system that was put in place after 1975 that restricted people from getting jobs or into colleges.They called it &quot;ch·ªß nghƒ©a l√Ω l·ªãch&quot; and apparently it was from 1 to 14, with 1 being the most advantageous or privileged while 14 was highly disadvantaged. The only information I learnt from them is that my family was 13 and 14 was for Chinese. 
 Does anyone know what the other 12 ranks are and what they mean? I haven&#x27;t been able to find a definitive source listing all of them out, both in English or Vietnamese.

 I am planning to move to Da Nang soon for work. The thing is I am only able to rent an apartment in advance through an agent without seeing everything in person.
 Anyone has a good tips to make sure the whole process is as smooth as possible and the most important thing is not to get scammed.
 I know I should probably get an Airbnb but there are also overpriced problems, fake reviews, bad experience on that app as well. 
 Thanks x 10000. I really appreciate any help and advice.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 You probably have heard this phrase many times. And as a Gen Z, I&#x27;m very sick of it. Like somehow, we become the center of all the bad things on this planet.
 I have many friends who are at my age or younger, and they had already achieved many admirable achievements. The achievements that (in my opinion) could be only in the dream of many people. And that was just in my circle of friends. On the daily news, there were also many youngsters who were managed to bring the pride for the nation despite of their young ages. They might be hard working students, talented athletes, or sometimes, dedicated teenagers who just wanna make change to this world, etc. 
 And after all of that, people choose to pick some of the &quot;th√†nh ph·∫ßn b·∫•t h·∫£o&quot; (undesirable person) to represent our whole generation. I mean, what make people think their generations are so superior ? And it is even more annoying when it comes to real life. Some of my &quot;non gen-Z&quot; colleagues in my work place even use that thinking to make fun of my every single opinions. Like... That is how your &quot;grew up&quot; ass should behave ? It is like... people need a dumpster for their toxicity, and somehow, we have become the main object for that.

I‚Äôm a single guy and I like to go out so always the possibility I will end up bringing someone back to hotel which seems like not allowed in hotels. Is this only talking about bar girls? Is it only 4/5 star hotels stopping people from bringing guest?
 Saw list online of guest friendly places but don‚Äôt want to be limited and most weren‚Äôt very nice or had poor reviews.

                              <span>My partner and I are planning our first trip to Vietnam next February and trying to plan our time as best as possible. We want to ensure we get as much in as possible, but we also worry we are moving too fast and not stopping to enjoy each stay enough. I wish we had more time, but we will head to Thailand after this trip and visit family. We will spend roughly ~18 days in each country.
 Nothing is set in stone yet as we are still researching and planning. We would love an outside eye from people with more experience than us. 
 Things we&#x27;ve considered but currently don&#x27;t have on the itinerary as of now, include Sa Pa and the Ha Going loop. My partner is not thrilled with the idea of motorbikes...
 ‚Äã
 ‚Äã
 Our Current Itenary:
 Day 1 Fly into Da Nang -&gt; Bus to Hoi An
 Day 2-4 Hoi An 
 Day 5 Bus Hoi An -&gt; Hue
 Day 6-7 Hue
 Day 8 Fly (Sleeper bus?) Hue -&gt; Hanoi
 Day 9-10 Hanoi
 Day 11 Bus Hanoi -&gt; Tom Coc
 Day 12-13 Tom Coc
 Day 14 Tom Coc -&gt; Hanoi
 Day 15-17 2 night 3 day Lan Han Bay Cruise
 Day 18 Fly Hanoi -&gt; Bangkok 
 ‚Äã
 Any advice or help would be much appreciated!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m looking to ship one medium sized suitcase (43 x 60 x26 cm) from Vietnam to the US at the end of this month. I haven&#x27;t packed and weighed it yet but I&#x27;m hoping 25 kg or less. It&#x27;s too small to move with one of the big international moving companies like Asian Tiger. Does anyone have an experience with companies like ShipMyBag or mybaggage or DHL for shipping luggage out of Vietnam? I&#x27;m interested in:
 (1) price
 (2) how long it took/if anything was lost or damaged
 (3) experiences with customs.
 It would be mostly clothes and souvenirs, no food and maybe a few electronics.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m coming to Vietnam for a month traveling north to south, still in the planning phase but we plan on doing a lot of day hikes and explore outside the main tourist areas, and do some activities like kayaking.
 Usually packing for holidays are quite easy for me to decide but I&#x27;ve never been to East Asia, and the hot weather and possible lots of rain? Makes it hard for me to decide, plus I like to travel light. 
 Warmth wise is there a chance of it getting cold anywhere in August? I&#x27;m wondering if to bring a fleece or micro fleece and a synthetic padded jacket, or if a fleece and windproof jacket might do. Also probably pack a bunch of hiking shorts and 1 pair of hiking trousers.
 Coat, I have a high end thick shell raincoat, under arm zip vents, dosent pack so small into a day bag though, great in the wind, but can imagine sweating loads if it&#x27;s warm and I&#x27;m walking. I have been meaning to get a lighter rain jacket so not sure if it&#x27;s worth getting one instead or if a poncho will be my best friend?
 Shoes, I&#x27;ve got some rugged Sandles, they seem good for the citys and and anywhere near water. Daily shoes though not sure. Hiking can it get really muddy? Hiking boots seem good but annoying to carry around when not in use. Waterproof shoes I imagine feet will get super hot. Or my usual all rounder shoe is my hiking trainer. It&#x27;s meshed so keeps my feet cool but takes forever to dry usually, and won&#x27;t handle heavy mud/rain well, can combine with waterproof socks. Although if it&#x27;s 30+ degrees maybe they might dry quicker? Or if there&#x27;s any type of fast dry hiking trainer people recommend? Any tips for an would be much appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>My friend and I fell victim to a new strategy that they use to save money. Our flight was scheduled for 8:35am and upon arrival at 6:15, they apparently cancelled the flight and that it was at 6:25am. Which means that we were too late to check in. Our travel agent checked on her end and says it still showed the original details. 
 Consequences: we miss the first flight, schedule a last minute flight with a different carrier, eventually missing the second leg of the flight because of the delays. Total cost is 260+160+90USD to get to where I need to be. 
 Their reasoning: they provided ample notification so they were not liable for us checking in ‚Äúlate‚Äù. No refund. For the second leg, our flight was within 3 hrs of the next leg ‚Äúaccording go policy‚Äù. They pulled up the relevant article on their website. No refund.

                              <span>Just came back from a summer trip to the US and the washer and dryers are just superior to anything I‚Äôve used here in Vietnam. I have an Electrolux washing machine and it takes forever to do a load and doesn‚Äôt clean soiled articles well. And a Candy brand dryer which doesn‚Äôt dry by air but by heating the drum and evaporating the water. Also takes forever to dry clothes/ blankets. 
 Does anyone know of any options in Vietnam for washer and dryers that are similar to what you would find in the US?

                              <span>I have been watching the series of videos about this recent fire on youtube. The first video shows the fire already established and locals rushing to save their livelihoods. There is one particularly sad scene where a man and his son rush to the fire carrying bowls of water. The man, intent on not spilling the water, finally pauses and looks up at what confronts him. You can see the despair in his eyes; the exact moment when he gives up against the impossible odds against him. Locals rush to and fro, helping set up the fire hoses, rushing in to battle the flames in any way they can, mostly getting in the way.
 The second video is of the aftermath. OP chats with one of the boat owners (I think, I have no Vietnamese unfortunately). What strikes me is the seeming lack of anger or sadness. It ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>I‚Äôm french born vietnamese and l‚Äôm planning to move to vietnam (with my boyfriend) because my mother is living there. I can speak and write in vietnamese and french fluently so I think is a plus for me to find a job there but what scare me the most is the work field that i‚Äôm actually in. I‚Äôm working in printing industry and from what I saw, the market is really saturated there (too much small and middle size company) and my profile is not that exceptional to compete with someone with the same skill but cheaper. So what kind of arguments can I give to recruiters to convince them to hire me ?

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I&#x27;ll (34M) be in Da Nang the second half of October and deciding which area to stay in. Trying to avoid overly touristy areas. I&#x27;d prefer to bike/walk to most places and to stay close-ish to the beach. But, if there&#x27;s a &quot;better&quot; place to stay further from the beach, I&#x27;m open to it. Priorities are proximity to (mostly) non-western restaurants, bars, coffee shops, historical sites‚Äîyou get it.
 My biggest priority though is meeting people. I&#x27;d really like to meet some locals and travelers at bars, non-western restaurants, meet-ups‚Äîwherever. I have a bad habit of exploring cities by myself and am actively trying to change that. Looking to meet people and have a good time, but not necessarily party/go to clubs. I heard Oi Bar was a good place to start. Any and all recommendations are appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>I am born in France with all my family being french, apart from my mother who is half french half Vietnamese, the mothers side having fought the french and her fathers side having fought and most probably in charge of various atrocities. 
 Since this sub seems open to a lot of various questions from all different sorts of people I wanted to have your opinion and thought about how french Vietnamese people are seen/treated in VN and how you feel as someone with a similar background. But this question originally came to me when I thought to myself
 &quot;Will I be seen with any disdain or ill treated if I am found out to be french when I eventually decide to go to VN?&quot;
 (I look very much European, but would be capable of hiding the fact that I am french as long as my passport in not required) I meant this with every ounce of respect. Thank you very much in advance. Bon jours de la Bastille en passant!

 I inherited this box from my (Eastgerman/GDR) grandmother. Who told me once this was from a friend in Vietnam? Can you help you me decipher what is being written here and/or what is displayed? 
 It is obviously a war scene with the airplanes and paratroopers in the background?
 Hope this is an appropriate request for this sub.

 According to the Chinese, the cause of this war is the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese have made mistakes, and the Chinese should teach the Vietnamese a lesson
 But in reality, it was Deng xiaoping who joined NATO, and this war was a show for the Americans

                              <span>It&#x27;s an often overlooked event of colonialism in Vietnam. Even in VN&#x27;s history lesson the teachers only talked briefly about it and not much is discussed about them at all here. Japan is well-known if their brutality in WW2 - often surpassed in the French in terms of exploitation and cruelty. Yet, most VN seems to have forgotten about them
 What&#x27;s your take?

 &quot;North Vietnam&#x27;s victory made the entire nation poor and undeveloped.&quot; is what the extreme anti-communists keep saying. To be honest, when the US army came to Vietnam with the intention of destroying the Vietnamese, thinking about your wealth seems luxurious.
 Here is the list of 33 massacres I found that were perpetrated by the US, the RoV and the South Korean armies.

 The Vietnamese fought simply to save their families and their own lives. If the enemies are going to kill you, what&#x27;s the point worrying about money?

                              <span>Hey I&#x27;m trying to see people&#x27;s opinion on this guy, Ive been watching his stuff now and then, knew him through his brother (an icon in vietnamese esports scene), I watched him go from a standup comedian to now doing mostly controversial videos. Most internet users in Vietnam arent that well educated, these people usually comment &quot;reactionary&quot; under his video or just casually insult him because of his disability. Now, personally, I partially agree with what he&#x27;s saying in his videos and I feel great that someone living in a society like Vietnam is brave enough to put out their different views, actively pointing out social, cultural flaws of the system (sometimes exaggerated though). I may be pretentious here but I consider myself a better than average young vietnamese person in terms of education, understanding of freedom of speech and open-mindedness, it would have been nice to have some meaningful polite conversations about his videos but as of right now, Vietnam is not at that level yet.

 Widespread accounts of sexual assault also exist, with some studies estimating that up to 10,000 Vietnamese women and girls were raped by South Korean soldiers.
 Korean forces are alleged to have perpetrated the Binh Tai, B√¨nh An/T√¢y Vinh, B√¨nh H√≤a, and H√† My massacres

 Are there any books, films, interviews about what they had to go through? Anyone with anecdotes from friends or family members that you‚Äôd be willing to share?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 Need honest and straight forward advice please.
 My girlfriend is Vietnamese, and I am looking to settle in Vietnam as my girlfriend don&#x27;t want to move overseas. I currently visit Vietnam every 2nd month on tourist visa.
 I don&#x27;t want to marry her just to buy a property sooner so looking for ways to find a property. I want to marry her at the right time and for good reasons.
 - Searching online doesn&#x27;t help as I have only been finding properties in USD
 - I will happily buy property together with her as long as it&#x27;s in both of our names and not just one name only
 If anyone can provide any guidance - I have simply read that foreigners can buy property in new projects/developments but that doesn&#x27;t help much as all the properties advertised in English seems to be spiked in price in USD.
 Would prefer property price of up to 1.8 billion VND and if I/we can get a home loan too, that would be absolutely perfect

                              <span>My wife‚Äôs iphone was stolen from the old quarter in Hanoi. This happened a block or two away from the water puppet theater. The thief took great advantage of us being vulnerable as it was raining, we were trying to manage our two kids and looking for a place to eat. Find my iPhone located it near a pawn shop 3 kms away from where we were. We were so tired and frustrated from our trip + the hotel staff advised us that there is no point pursuing the phone or the police. Later, a shop owner told us to w should have gone to the police and they might have been able to help. Whatever. Now we are back in our country. It is what it is but as much as I don‚Äôt want it does affect our emotions and feelings towards Hanoi and touristy areas. This can happen in many places and in many countries but still when it happens to one personally, it‚Äôs hard to not be biased. We had overall pretty good time in Vietnam, esp in Saigon and DaNang.
 Have things like this happened to any of you?

                              <span>My family is in HCM for 2 weeks and my little sister is bored to death with the sight-seeing and stressful shopping at big marketplaces. We found a cute stationary/gift shop called ·ªêc S√™n Shop that she absolutely LOVED and a cat cafe that featured rescue cats which she stayed hours at. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations of activities or shops that are similar? We stopped by R√°ch Gia earlier last week and found a boutique called Barbie House which she also expressed interest in. So I guess any cute gift shops / clothing boutiques / fun activities around here that would interest a late teens sister. 
 Thanks in advance!!

 In my culture this is not really a thing, and we don&#x27;t usually bring gifts... but I know it&#x27;s common in southeast Asian culture and I don&#x27;t want to offend anyone.
 My gf is telling me I don&#x27;t have to bring anything, but her sisters Vietnamese boyfriends all brought some food or alcohol the first time they visited her family according to her lol.
 I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for several months now and known my gf for over a year.
 Any help/advice is appreciated:)

 I was just focused on developing my career and achieving &#x27;white people&#x27; success in mum and dad&#x27;s eyes I didn&#x27;t really put in the effort to connect ... I came by this track recently and it got me in the feels:

 Does anyone feel like they could have put in more effort into learning Vietnamese to connect with family members now that we&#x27;re older (25 and up) ... sometimes I feel bad about this üòï

                              <span>I&#x27;m soon going to Vietnam to visit a friend, but I want to bring something special for his mother...an older woman in her late 60&#x27;s, little schooling, who has spent much of her life working in the rice fields. Any interesting suggestions...something that might not take up too much room on a carry on bag? What might she appreciate and/or actually use? Maybe it would be better to find something in Vietnam for her that would be appropriate?

                              <span>When you go to a Vietnamese restaurant do you stand at the door and wait to be seated or do you just go in and sit wherever you like?
 In the US we always wait to be seated unless there is a sign that says &quot;seat yourself&quot;.
 I&#x27;m a bit awkward so I don&#x27;t want to just stand at the door like a moron waiting to be seated if I&#x27;m supposed to just seat myself anywhere.

                              <span>Currently, all over the world are having a headache about the problem of underground pollution. The cause is caused by human production activities such as the use of chemical drugs into the ground too much.Causing the phenomenon of barren land cannot be reused and that land becomes dead land. With the current population growth, the food problem is also a major problem, if the land cannot be reused, it will cause food shortage problems, and may also cause groundwater pollution in the underground.

 I hope you&#x27;re well.
 I&#x27;m going to be in Vietnam for a few weeks in August and I was thinking of catching a train in a direction, for the experience of having done it. 
 But I find myself stuck on which direction to go! I&#x27;m thinking of H√† N·ªôi to ƒê√† N·∫µng or the other way around. What do you think?

                              <span>HI, I need an app to link a foreign card to it and make payments cashless payments, such as sending money from my foreign bank card to Vietnamese nationals&#x27; bank accounts.
 Asked some wallets such as Momo and Vnpay, they support only Vietnamese cards.
 Tried Paypal the fee is ~34% (took 0.34$ from 1.00$ test payment, also put the amount on hold for the reciever), so I&#x27;m looking for cheaper options.

                              <span>Hello friends
 I will be visiting Hanoi in September. I am looking to book a cruise to Halong Bay. I can see that there are loads of cruise operators and website advertising this. How do we check if they are legit, and what scams should we look out for? The reason why I am asking and abit weary is when I booked my hotel, my phone has been getting messages non stop from the hotel, telling us to book a tour with them instead and warning of scams from other operators.
 I am interested in this tour company is anybody able to tell me if it‚Äôs legit?
 https://www.cruisehalongbay.com
 I have attached some screenshots about some registration number that this business posses.
 Thank you very much!

                              <span>I am traveling in vietnam for the first time and I am overwhelmed by the country, the people and their warmth and friendliness and the food. Now I was a few nights in a cute homestay. I wanted to extend this by one night, but I could not, because the room has already been booked again. Now they have offered me a small apartment, which I gratefully accepted. I was brought there by a friend of the owner with the motorcycle (about 10 minutes drive). When I asked her how much I should pay for the ride, she replied that she wanted nothing. Tomorrow I will leave this apartment again. Now my question to you: should I leave her the money for the ride tomorrow or just a small tip for the apartment? If so, how much would be appropriate? Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Every time when the yearly mass military recruitment wave is approaching, people would bring up this topic to debate but after 1 or 2 weeks it&#x27;d fade away. Supposedly it&#x27;s a major reason for people to bribe out of the service and funny enough it&#x27;s actually easy to avoid the mandatory calling.

                              <span>What do you recommend as bank for foreigners that can do money transfers to international accounts via their online platform? Because I&#x27;m so done with HSBC.
 I&#x27;ve been with HSBC for 4 years now for my salary account and their customer service is utterly disgusting. After 4 calls, 12 emails and a visit to the bank, they still aren&#x27;t able to address my concern. My credit card will be blocked two days from now, and I had submitted all the documents 2 weeks before, but they still aren&#x27;t processing it. All the email replies are canned templates and calling their hotlines cost a lot because it&#x27;s just recorded music. The customer service representatives are clueless and they just keep repeating what is written on the website, and not answering my questions. It&#x27;s so tiring to talk with them.
 No wonder they have mostly 1 star reviews on Google. All 206 reviews averaged to 1.7. What a joke for an &quot;international&quot; bank.
 I&#x27;m checking Citibank and Shinhan Bank, what do you guys recommend?

                              <span>Hi, for few months back i started to grow some passions about cinema, and i would like to go for University of Theater and Cinema, but since the date to apply already concluded.
 I have a dream to become a small director, to do a small project, some short films about my life or making a big one with the size compare to cinema. I wanted to brought our country&#x27;s film to a next level, maybe everyone are also like me, but i feel it.
 In Ho Chi Minh, is there any training center or other College i can learn to be one, from the techniques to using cameras, edits,... So i can know the details in every part once i making the film, now i&#x27;m already starting to develop some scripts which i think it could tell something, might just a crap but it is what i love.
 I can&#x27;t thank you enough for this

 I heard this was common for ppl who are Vietnamese and entering into the country. 
 Is this still normal? If so, how much cash should I bring?

                              <span>My boyfriend is in Vietnam with a group of guy friends and I saw a reddit post saying if you go clubbing with a group of guys, the girls that work there will accompany them. Is this true? How does it work? I trust my boyfriend but I don‚Äôt trust the strangers that could possibly spike his drink and I‚Äôm uncomfortable about the fact that they‚Äôll have sexy women keeping him company.

Is there a Vietnamese word to refer to the current counter-culture? (I.e. tattoo, graffiti, dark music, extreme art etc) thanks üòá

 My family escaped from Saigon to USA. They tried their best to give me a Vietnamese upbringing. I remember that it was going well. I started to hang out with my cousins who were born in Vietnam and came over to USA when I was in elementary school. I was bullied by how I spoke in Vietnamese and never felt fully welcomed by them. I moved away from an Asian community in middle school and was bullied for being Asian. There were few Asian people but they somehow fit in with the white or black crowd. I mo‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Vietnam is in my bucket list for a long time. This big country cannot be explode in 7 days so I have decided that I will travel and in between I have to work. 1. If I take a tourist sim card with 5G is it enough to connect my laptop and work ? Mostly IT work in Google Chrome and some software. No video upload etc. 2. Which sim card to take for this 30 day plan ? 3. I see lot of buses operate in cities. Are these AC buses, operate on time ? (Or like Indian buses. No schedule). 4. For travel between cities how early I need to book train/bus ticket ? Which website can I use to book ? 5. Any concern on snatching/pickpocketing? 6. My plan is saigon - DMZ - da nang/hoi an / hue - Hanoi - ninh bin - cat ba island. Is it ok or shall I add something? Exit from Hanoi airport. Max I can spend 3 to 4 weeks. In between I have to work full days :( 7. I don&#x27;t speak vietnemese at all. Will there be issue with ordering food with street food vendor? Thanks.

                              <span>Da Nang has been showing me so many new things. Around ~9-9:15pm on C·∫ßu R·ªìng, there was a bunch of motorbikes speeding (like i have never seen vehicles go this fast in Vietnam&#x27;s big cities) down the bridge with guys on the back whipping belts out. Eventually, one guy is on the ground with his bike knocked down, getting beaten with belts. The perps take off, leaving the guy curled up in fetal position. This all happened in the middle of moving traffic.
 I guess....WTF??? I&#x27;m assuming this is a one-off but seems very bold to be doing it so publicly.

                              <span>As the title says, I&#x27;m looking for some interesting documentaries to learn more about the country and culture. Unfortunately mostly when searching the only ones that come up are war related, for which I have no interest in rehashing. Ideally I&#x27;d like to find content thats more in depth on the culture, not just random tourism focused stuff.
 Any recommendations would be appreciated. Likewise if there are any better news/current affairs publications beyond VNexpress/TuoiTre that would also be great.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about this statement. None of my Vietnamese friends have been able to give me a concrete answer yet...
 Why is it that every conversation I have with older folks here (male or female) seems to go in the exact same direction? How long you been here? What is your job? How old are you? Are you married? NO?! Then they insist I marry a Vietnamese woman.
 Sometimes it&#x27;s a quick, lighthearted suggestion but then other times it&#x27;s a full on sales pitch. One old man told me that he likes the look of western women, but they don&#x27;t age well like Vietnamese women do so I best take up a Vietnamese wife... which I found very funny. 
 So why do you guys think this happens? People seem so passionate about suggesting it to me

                              <span>I am aware of the fact that this is a common problem among every community but it seems really ridiculous in Vietnam. Whenever I play a game, I often stumble upon Vietnamese with hard swears as their username, and they&#x27;re often pretty toxic. I was playing this game about tanks, we lost the match because a guy on our team was afk. I notified the enemy team of his position and that&#x27;s when this guy, with the most original username ever, (Ditmemay12) starts to unleash his tantrum on me. He told me to shut up, I&#x27;m like what? The afk guy was the only one left on our team so I wanted to get this over with. What was he trying to do? Show his typing skills? Show how much of a failure he has become? (Btw the guy sucks at the game). It&#x27;s not the first time I have seen such behaviours, it&#x27;s everywhere. On Facebook, Discord, etc. Any social media platform that has Vietnamese. Again, I know it&#x27;s a common problem and those people does not represent the entirety of he Vietnamese community. But I feel like those kinds of people take up a hefty percentage of the community. Have anyone gotten the same experience as me?

                              <span>We have been staying in Hanoi for a week already and we are staying the next three weeks. We‚Äôve been getting by using google translate and common sense and so far he‚Äôs tried a wide variety of Vietnamese food without a reaction. Seems like a lot of food uses soy oil so far. He carries epi pens with him.
 However, people are often confused by the translated message and we think it‚Äôs not clear. 
 Using google translate from English to viet to English, ‚Äúno nuts, no sesame‚Äù returns as ‚Äúno seeds. Unseasoned‚Äù which isn‚Äôt helpful at all hahaha.
 Also nuts can translate to peanuts but he is allergic to all nuts and nut oils. Sesame also seems to have multiple translations.
 A translation of something like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt eat nuts, nut oils, sesame, sesame oil. Does this food contain them?‚Äù would be ideal! :D 
 thank you for any help!!
 Edit If you‚Äôre interested hes only eating a small bite of food then waiting 5-10 mins for a reaction to be safe. if he reacted he would make himself throw it up. He also has tablets and 4 epi pens. He‚Äôs also a med student.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ll be in Vietnam for 8 or 9 days in December. Packing super light and will have just a large backpack with me.
 I&#x27;m planning on flying into Ho Chi Minh city, spending a couple of nights, then I want to make the trek up to Hanoi. Does anyone have suggestions on how to do this, and what the most interesting path might be? Also is it safe to travel alone or are there some sketchy parts I should avoid?
 Ideally I&#x27;d love to rent a motorcycle and ride up myself... but I&#x27;ve never ridden a motorcycle or driven in Asia so scratch that idea. Is there some kind of boat I can take, or something? I&#x27;d love to make my way up to Hanoi over the course of 5-6 days and see as much of Vietnam as I can.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

                              <span>Hello guys, I am planning trip to Vietnam for 2024. The best time would be sometime between january to march, but there is also lunar year at 10th feb and I heard there is nothing todo by that time and everything is more expensive. Is that true? Is it better to come after Lunar Year? Anyway I was also googling something about Vietnam Craft Beer and beer festivals. I found something but doesn‚Äôt give much info really. Is there something like that? Could you tell me more about craft beer in Vietnam please? Thank you

                              <span>Hello! I‚Äôm here with my Vietnamese boyfriend and his family.
 I‚Äôve been looking a little at clothes and everything is for skinny people, is there any stores in Saigon you could recommend for bigger girls?
 Fells weird saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúbigger‚Äù when I‚Äôm normal sized in my own country, but I do understand the Asian standards of being skinny.

 I&#x27;m a major fan of Vietnamese food, but this will be my first time visiting Vietnam. Are there any specific dishes that you would recommend for me to try out? The more local, the better!

 Heartwarming and very considerate staff Price is roughly 400k ‚Ç´ per person
 I&#x27;m saying this because I&#x27;ve tried over 35+ well known buffets in Vietnam (saigon, da nang, nha trang... etc) and this buffet hits the spot. 
 Just my 2cents of course. Ps: not a commissioner but a foodie influencer on ig from america

 95% of the girls working those ‚Äúbooking‚Äù scams work for this group. 
 You‚Äôre welcome lol.

 Question: Are there any lounges you would recommend in Terminal 2 of Hanoi airport? Would you pay when you arrive or book in advance?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My (23 F) boyfriend (23 M) is from HCM city and moved to America one year ago. We‚Äôve been dating for over six months and the relationship has gotten serious.
 I love him (surprisingly, his family also loves me) and it‚Äôs looking like things might end in marriage down the line. I‚Äôm amazed they accept me so easily when my family doesn‚Äôt accept him, but I try my best anyway. His family wants everyone to live together someday soon. My boyfriend says no.
 My boyfriend has a rebellious spirit. His cousin bought me VN government-issued textbooks to study the language, but he doesn‚Äôt want to teach me Vietnamese manners. It leads to awkward situations with his family A LOT. He says ‚Äújust be yourself, it‚Äôs America!‚Äù but I want his family‚Äôs approval.
 His parents were very poor in VN and are very traditional. My family is rich and has more advanced manners than average Americans. I grew up with my grandparents too, so I act and dress more like an older lady. It‚Äôs funny because sometimes I act like a polite American to his parents and they say to my boyfriend ‚Äúshe has Vietnamese manners, nice‚Äù. I‚Äôm totally uneducated but I know I offend them a little sometimes. 
 For example, he didn‚Äôt tell me I should offer his parents to eat before I eat their food. Things like that. 
 Please, if anyone has information on how not to offend Vietnamese parents, tell me. I never dress provocatively or curse, and I try to be as helpful as possible in the kitchen. My boyfriend‚Äôs family gives me a lot of patience as a westerner, but I want to do the right thing.
 Thank you üíó

 For context, I am 100% local. Vietnamese I mean. I just left Vietnam last year for my study, after 32 years living in the country, Ho Chi Minh City to be specific.

I am very independent, in almost everything, mentality, finance, living style etc. I own what I say, and do. I have a big extended family with 10 uncles and aunties, and a small immediate family with a single mom and a big older brother (we are 18 years old apart). I grew up without a father, and he‚Äôs around somewhere in this country, just not around in any form. My family is very respectful, and I am very proud of them. My mother is a strong woman who went through a lot of things to raise me ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Really embarrassed to talk about this. I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy. I just wanted to warn other travellers about this.
 I‚Äôm a foreigner from London. Have been using a dating app here. I noticed there are some girls on the app who are very eager to meet right away and go for a drink. Stupidly, I agreed to go with one this evening.
 She told me to meet her around the corner from Sniff club. Met her, looked nothing like her photos (which hardly showed her face anyway). She led us to this club.
 She didn‚Äôt even speak English and we communicated via google translate‚Ä¶
 She said she wanted to drink champagne ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so I bought a bottle. Then she asked if she can do some balloons, and kept asking for more and more. At one point she suggested I tip the bar staff. 
 She was super flirty and touching me all over. Until I said no to more balloons she acted like a grumpy child.
 I noticed some girls who were waiting on the corner, who later on were in the same club with some foreigner men.
 I am quite sure these girls are employed by the club to get men to come in and spend money. My total bill was 5 million‚Ä¶
 It‚Äôs a sad feeling to be taken advantage of like this. Everyone I‚Äôve met so far has been so kind and generous to me.
 So yea, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is!

                              <span>My mom has very little teeth left. She wants to get partial dentures when she go back to Vietnam next year because of the affordable cost. 
 She has the money to get them done in the US but refuses because she wants to save money.
 My extended family is advising her to get them done in the US to avoid complications and is pressuring me to convince her. They said the dentists in Vietnam are incompetent and that if she were to have issues with the dentures, she will have to get them redo in the States which will cost even more money. 
 I understand both sides of the argument. I‚Äôm unsure what to tell my mom 
 Can you guys share your thoughts on this matter?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m currently exploring to find a new long-term home in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve been living in the Philippines for 6+ years, and one year in Indonesia, so I&#x27;m used to some of the pros &amp; cons of living in SEA like:
  
Natural disasters (PH has tons of typhoons, ID has lots of earthquakes although tbh I hardly notice those)
 Shit politics that drive you insane
 Expensive X (in PH food is overpriced AF, in Indonesia, electronic are overpriced AF)
 Terrible commute to the office if you can&#x27;t walk it
  
Hardly anything shocks me. I just go with the flow and accept the bad stuff or ignore it when possible.
 BUT of course, some things can be dealbreakers.
 I&#x27;m not in PH right now only because I lost my home in the Philippines during COVID and at this point, I&#x27;m not too sure to go back. It&#x27;s a long and ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Just curious, it might become a reality, and Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, and Vietnam fall along a line in the ocean that would become a war zone.
 Edit: that line of US/National bases extends from South Korea to Singapore/Malaysia. 
 There‚Äôs also a treaty in Thailand up until about 2045 iirc.

                              <span>I‚Äôve heard that foreigner men attract lots of Vietnamese women. Do female foreigners also attract lots of Vietnamese men for long term relationships? Is it a turn off if the women make a lot more then the men (due to having an expat salary)?
 Curious to hear your opinions!
 Ps: what about Western asian women?

                              <span>In a particular marketing team, there is a supervisor who holds the same number of years of work experience as the other team members but demonstrates less competence. It is evident to everyone in the office that the supervisor is the CEO&#x27;s favorite employee. Whenever the CEO makes an insensitive joke, if the supervisor reacts poorly, the CEO apologizes. However, if anyone else in the team reacts negatively, the CEO calls them out, expressing dissatisfaction with their response.
 Interestingly, it was the supervisor who recently fired a colleague, but the CEO publicly supported the decision, attributing it to himself. This situation suggests that the CEO is protecting the supervisor by taking responsibility for the dismissal. This lack of transparency creates an unbalanced power dynamic within the office. After the incident, the office became dull.
 Moreover, the supervisor constantly seeks to know what others are doing, including questioning their work methods. This behavior can be bothersome, especially when team members are competent and experienced. For instance, one team member was surprised when the supervisor asked for assistance with a basic marketing task, such as scheduling social media posts. It is disconcerting when someone in an executive role lacks knowledge of fundamental marketing tools.
 These observations raise my concerns about power dynamics within the team. The supervisor appears to be favored, even with her limited competence, while others are held to a different standard. Additionally, the CEO&#x27;s protection of the supervisor and the supervisor&#x27;s micromanagement tendencies suggest an abuse of power.

 Thanks.

 Are there any other verbs that have a seperate word which refers to the same action but in a different tense?

                              <span>My wife‚Äôs family is Vietnamese. When we play blackjack with her family and coworkers, they play a version where the Ace card can equal 1, 10, or 11. I‚Äôm American and the only way I‚Äôve seen this game played prior is with an Ace being valued only as either 1 or 11. Is this normally how Vietnamese play or do they have their own rules for the game? I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback.

This also happened in the afternoon when they sing for the fucking NEIGHBORHOOD. I feel cold ans my head aches. Why do people love karaoke so much? don‚Äôt they have any human decency? Don‚Äôt they think about the consequences of their action?

                              <span>Does anyone know of a private driver that can take us from dong Hoi to phang nha caves and then drop us off at dong Hoi airport. Unfortunately only have 1 day in dong Hoi and then have to catch flight at 8 pm. I see lots of day tours from dong Hoi but not sure I would be back in time to then get to airport. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I would like to move to Vietnam and I was wondering if anyone had an idea of the salary there for a lawyer working for one of the Big 4? I want to know how I should negociate my salary and what expectations to have. 
 Last time I went, I met a ‚Äúproject manager‚Äù in a construction company, and he said he was making $6000USD/month. Is that reasonable to think that I could make close to this kind of salary?

                              <span>So i found this website that shows you the freedom rating of countries around the world, and you cant even access it without a VPN if youre in Vietnam which is already a major red flag. When i go to check what our rating is its 19/100 for global freedom and 22/100 for internet freedom which is way way worse than i had original thought (Though i can‚Äôt guarantee if the data is correct or not). I want to hear about your experiences living here and about how correct that is.
 P.S the website is called Freedom House

                              <span>I know i probably shouldn&#x27;t be asking the internet, but I&#x27;m currently in Vietnam and this has become a recent problem. Two days ago i woke up with this mark after sleeping in a hotel room in Vietnam (Nortern region). I didn&#x27;t notice it until i saw it in the mirror but now it has become more irritated (probably because of the friction with my clothes). I don&#x27;t know how i got it, what it is and how to take care of it. It&#x27;s on my ribcage and is about 3 cm in hight, the redness has spread over time.
 First two pictures are current, third is what it looked like in the beginning.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I notice that many businesses in Vietnam use Facebook as their &quot;only&quot; web presence. And either Facebook Messenger, Zalo, or Telegram as the &quot;only &quot; chat app to allow their prospective clients to reach them.
 If you don&#x27;t have an active facebook account, you can&#x27;t view their content freely. Facebook would keep on pestering you to login. ( I regularly face this problem. )
 Many businesses have websites, but instead of a regular inbuilt chat feature, there would be either Facebook Messenger, Zalo or Telegram. If you don&#x27;t have one of these apps ; you can&#x27;t contact them. ( My personal experience for 3 years) 
 Does it ever occur to them that how many businesses they lose because of this limitation? Why not give multiple options to their clients? Why force them to download a new chat app?

Would it still be worth seeing Ha Long Bay after I‚Äôve been to those places? I‚Äôve heard the water is polluted and not swimmable. Should I spend my time seeing other part of VN? Thanks

I‚Äôve recently built my own computer and wanted to play crossfire like I did when I was in Vietnam, however the system requires me to text the automated sms system to confirm the account. I don‚Äôt live in Vietnam anymore and can‚Äôt figure out a way to do it online( all free websites only allow to send full number). Could I use your number to do it lol? üòÖ

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ll be arriving in Danang a bit late (9:30pm). Does anyone know if the mobile SIM card kiosks will still be open? I&#x27;ll be arriving from abroad and will need to hail a Grab to my hotel...so I&#x27;ll need data to do that.
 If not available, is there wifi in the airport?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m planning to visit Vietnam in October. I&#x27;m preparing my trip and I&#x27;ve read plenty of recommendations on Reddit, what do you guys think of this itinerary:
 2 days: Hanoi (arrival)
 3 days tour to Ha Giang Loop Tour
 2 days tour to Halong Bay
 2 days tour to Ninh Binh
 1 day: Hanoi (departure)
 I&#x27;m missing something?
 Thank you.

                              <span>I was recently travelling in Southeast Asia and I was shocked by the behaviour of people (especially Vietnamese) regarding trash and plastic. I saw so many people (young and old) simply throwing their trash onto the street: people eating chips and dropping the bag in the sidewalk, a man putting deodorant and tossing it to the middle of the road, plastic bottles, bags, cans of drinks‚Ä¶ basically litter everywhere. 
 This is particularly disturbing in big cities like Hanoi and Saigon, which are apparently developed and everyone has a phone and internet, but no one seems to have environmental awareness about reducing and recycling their waste.
 I can understand that old habits die hard and older people continue doing that, but the younger ones seem to follow that path as well. 
 Also, the amount of plastic is insane. Is there really a need to get a drink in a plastic cup, inside a plastic bag, sealed with a plastic lid and drink it from a plastic straw? Even if you drink it on the spot and not take away, they will still put the plastic lid with a machine. On top of that, after finishing the drink, all that plastic ends up being dumped on the street.
 I‚Äôm no environmental ‚Äúfreak‚Äù or entitled European, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious if this is an issue being addressed by Vietnamese people (in schools, public campaigns) or if they simply don‚Äôt care. Has there been any improvement in recent years? Do you think there will be?

                              <span>Xin ch√†o! What are nice spots/mountains for hiking in Vietnam? When I was there a few months ago, I was kinda disappointed. Not by the landscape and nature but rather by the accessibility and availability of tracks. I went hiking near Da Lat and Phan Thiet, which was great, but although the north is a lot more mountainous, they were barely accessible due to dense forests and lack of paths. Sometimes there was &quot;too easy&quot; access, which attracts tourists (e.g., viewpoint in Ninh Binh). Ofc Fansipan is an option but I&#x27;d rather do the tour by myself without a guide, also I heard it&#x27;s quite touristic. Do you have any areas or specific mountains which you would recommend?

                              <span>Hello. I would just make this post into a numbered list because I can&#x27;t organize my thoughts well. I hope someone can help us üôè
  
My mother was born in Saigon in 1969.
 She was able to get a copy of her birth certificate from the Philippine Statistics Authority but it is illegible.
 We emailed the Philippine Embassy in Hanoi but they said there&#x27;s no report of her birth in the archives.
  
If the Philippine Embassy said her birth has no record, is there really no other way for her to get a legible copy of her birth certificate? The local registry here says she should send her personal documents to Vietnam for the correction of her birth certificate, but would it make sense to do that if her birth really has no record in the archives?

                              <span>I am looking to replace a portable screen for my travel office equipment. Selection on lazada etc is very limited and weak on specs / details.
 Are there any larger electronics stores that would have such products in stock to check out in person? As an example, this is a model that seems to be generally be sold in Vietnam and I would be glad to pickup https://www.amazon.com/LG-16MR70-ASDU1-Protable-Monitor-Silver/dp/B0BZQJ5SPC
 If I have to resort to an online e-commerce vendor, is it more custom to pay upon delivery or ahead of shipping? Does not having a VN bank account usually make such transaction hard?

                              <span>How is the weather in September?
 Want to travel from September 15 to October 15?
 Does it rain a lot, or just short time in the afternoon?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Good Morning All,
 I am an American and I live permanently in Viet Nam with my wife who is Vietnamese.
 I have lived in Viet Nam for 10 years now and we recently moved here to live a more simpler life. However, I&#x27;ve been thinking about opening up my own business as I have extensive experience in my field and I feel quite confident I can make it work well.
 My question is what is the least hassle-free way of doing this. I have zero problem putting the business 100% into my wife&#x27;s name if it means less issues.
 Would this be the recommended course of action? If so, is anyone aware of the fees or capital requirements for a 100% Vietnamese owner versus a foreigner owner? Anything else that might be worth taking into consideration?
 I&#x27;m not trying to shortcut any taxes or anything like that. I have no problem paying my fair share. I&#x27;m just trying to get everything started as cost-effectively as possible.
 Thanks!

                              <span>We will be travelling from Ninh Binh to Hue in October with our 4yo, who is not fully toilet-independent and still needs help on the toilet. 
 The train is of course much more convenient logistically than flying, but I have read so many horror blogs and reviews about cockroaches and absolutely feral toilets and smokers on the train etc. 
 It&#x27;s now 2023 and I am not sure if some of the older reviews still hold. Has anyone done this recently? Should I just go back to Hanoi and fly to Hue and simply suck up the waste of a day? 
 Also, is the &#x27;rainy season&#x27; in Hue/Hoi An in mid-October absolutely awful or usually ok for tourist activities? We booked international flight from Danang before checking weather so we are pretty much stuck with going to central area. Thanks in advance for any help.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My Vietnamese girlfriend&#x27;s mom was recently admitted into the hospital for some health issues. I would like to get her Get Well flowers.
 In the past I messed up by getting white flowers for my gf on Valentine&#x27;s days. Supposedly her mom was not happy about it being white, because white is suppose to be used during a passing.
 What would be an appropriate color for flowers for this occasion?
 Appreciate the help!

Never any backing vocals from the instrumentalists and never lead singing while playing an instrument. Is it an aesthetic thing or do people just like when someone does one thing well?

                              <span>So Ive decided to settle in vietnam and want to transfer my funds from my home country. Things like western union wouldn‚Äôt work because I need a way to reliably transfer a large amount
 I want to open an account in a vietnamese bank and do a swift transfer at the lowest cost. The bank im sending my money from charge 0 fees.
 I also have a vietnamese citizenship

                              <span>Out of curiosity, from those who have experienced any of these how effective does everyone think these following traditions are?: - Wind snatching (D·∫≠t gi√≥) - Wind scraping (C·∫°o gi√≥) - Cupping (Gi√°c h∆°i) - Acupressure (B·∫•m Huy·ªát) - Bloodletting (C·∫Øt ll·ªÉ)
 Do they actually help with what they intend to do (e.g reduce pain/stiffness, cure diseases, improve skin or health etc.) or are they mainly placebo from your experience?
 Context if you‚Äôre curious: I‚Äôve lived in Australia my whole life and an currently in Vietnam to visit family after a long time. My family is very insistent on using traditional medicine techniques to improve my skin. They took me to a doctor who put small cuts on my skin all over my body, and when I searched this up I got the term ‚ÄòC·∫Øt ll·ªÉ‚Äô for bloodletting. They‚Äôve been doing this almost more than weekly and they say that it‚Äôs getting all the bad blood out. In my opinion it‚Äôs a real pain and honestly I doubt it‚Äôs doing anything. But maybe it works for others?
 I‚Äôve been provided wind scraping before with my family using the green eagle medicine and they said that the redder it is the more sick I am. It‚Äôs probably very red because of how hard they scrape it into my skin! It definitely helps warm you up though.
 I‚Äôm just wondering how this all is for both people who have lived in vietnam and how normal it all is. Thank you!

                              <span>For a lot of us in the west, when we feel disillusioned with the way the world is going, we take positions against our government, take up anti-establishment slogans and listen to anti-establishment music. Fashion, music and art styles are born from opposition to cultural norms and government direction.
 How do people in Vietnam (and I suppose other one-party, unitary countries) express their dissatisfaction with contemporary culture without being political about it? Are young people generally less rebellious when there&#x27;s a legitimate threat to criticising your country? How widely accepted is Vietnamese education with regards to politics and history? Do people tend to question it or accept it wholesale?
 Sorry if this is a controversial topic, it&#x27;s just something that&#x27;s been on my mind

                              <span>Hi! I‚Äôm visiting from overseas and have a few questions about the area:
 1) I can see lots of demolished buildings around Da Nang - what happened? 
 2) I noticed some buildings (houses mostly) are in the middle of empty urban lots - how come? 
 3) A lot of the shops in old town Hoi An sell the exact same products - why is this? Edit: by this I mean multiple stores selling the exact same T-shirt. Supply issue? Same owners? 
 4) In Da Nang lots of beach front hotels have been half built - is this because of Covid? 
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>I am coming home to the mother land for three weeks.
 I&#x27;ve been looking for things to do in Saigon and nothing really appeals to me. Obviously food and coffee culture there is amazing but what else?
 I also hate busy hustle and bustle cities. I currently live in one and want to get away from it.
 My plan is to go surfing and exploring in vung tau for 5-6 days. And then go to a relaxing resort/beach in phu quoc for 5 days.
 That still leaves about 7 days in Saigon... I wonder if I should just spend more time in vung tau and phu quoc instead of Saigon since I don&#x27;t like city/night life.
 What you guys think?

                              <span>I am Ukrainian model working in Japan. My boyfriend‚Äôs Vietnamese. He used to be a model (that is how we met and fell in love ü•∞), but now he has his own business.
 He is from a business family in Hanoi. His parents studied abroad and had business in Eastern Europe. So they can speak some Ukrainian. 
 His mom‚Äôs a lovely woman. She took care of me like her daughter. She bought me new clothes, taught me Vietnamese. I feel like little princess when staying with his family.
 She told me to get into university, because model is not a long lasting career. She‚Äôll fund my education if I become her daughter in law 
 I love her, but I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs trying to control me. Or I‚Äôm overthinking, bc I watch too many Korean dramas.
 Do old Viet parents change behavior after a girl become their official con dau?
 Can anyone give thoughts to this topic? ESP Vietnamese people or foreign women getting married with Vietnamese men
 Are there any Eastern European girls marrying with Vietnamese here? How is your relationship with Nha Chong

I don&#x27;t know what kind of insurance there is for airbnbs, is it the same ? It seems cheaper and less complicated for me to take the airbnb but i&#x27;m not sure if I am making the right choice or if there&#x27;s any downsides to it.

 I&#x27;ve been told I can let my hotel know that I&#x27;ll be gone for a few days and book a hotel elsewhere, but I&#x27;m broke and would like to use the hotel days I purchased in Hanoi if possible. Why would it be a bad idea to do a day trip anyway?
 Thank you all and happy 4th!

                              <span>24 y/o guy been wanting to visit for a while now, but life has gotten in the way up until now. 
 I‚Äôd love to stay for 3-6 months, and perhaps visit some other countries in SEA but we will see. Maybe even 6+ months if budget allows. 
 Would this an okay budget? I‚Äôll have around 10k usd/237,100,000 vnd saved, and hoping to spend around 1,000-1500 usd a month if possible, but can go up in budget if needed.
 I‚Äôm good with street food and a simple affordable condo/apartment that maybe has a pool or something, I‚Äôm a simple guy. I don‚Äôt shop much or drink much, but I would like to participate in the nightlife some(few beers) and maybe go on some dates etc like on some weekends. Just have a little fun I guess.
 Sightseeing and experiences.. I have a few places in mind but would love a bunch of recommendations. Id like to explore around most of the country as much as possible so hit me with suggestions of some great places you enjoy. I have an interest in everything really!
 I think that‚Äôs about it, haha. And if there‚Äôs anyone who wants to show me around/go out for some fun when I land, I‚Äôd love to meet. Thanks in advance and hope yall are having a good day :)

                              <span>Question 50 in the English high school graduation exam has stirred up controversy among candidates. 
 &quot;Their pioneering (A) research showed that the learning motivation of the two groups of learners was quite distinctive (B) from each other, and the comparative (C) group whose learning motivation was stronger performed better than the control (D) group.&quot;

 The task requires identifying the underlined part that needs correction. 
 There were debates surrounding the correct answer, particularly regarding options B (distinctive) and C (comparative). Well-known IELTS teachers like Kien Luyen and Mai Phuong weighed in on the matter.
 ‚Äã
 ü§î While the official answer is B (distinctive), there are still many teachers who hold reservations about this conclusion.
 ‚Äã
 In your opinion, which answer do you believe is correct?

When I was young, I was in a baby walker and fell into a wood stove in the kitchen. There was no knowledge back in those days of how dangerous these baby walkers were. It left me with almost 90% burns to my body. After the accident, I was transported to Children&#x27;s Hospital 1 in Saigon, where I stayed for two years for intensive care and treatment.

                              <span>I have a couple of Vietnamese flag stickers that I want to put on my laptop (along with Australia, Germany and Esperanto, to represent my favourite languages). However, my girlfriend said the Vietnamese flag (red background, gold star) could be considered offensive to people (particularly southern Vietnamese, who have their own flag AFAIK) who had left Vietnam and might cause a problem if someone sees it. Is it that much of a problem?
 EDIT: I have now plastered the shining star onto the back of my laptop! Ha ha.

                              <span>I know that the salary of the staff at the ward administrative agencies is sometimes only 4.000.000 vnd per month. This salary is even lower than unskilled workers. Even with prime minister, it&#x27;s only around 20.000.000 vnd. With this salary, no one can survive or support their family with only one job. It&#x27;s not uncommon for them to regularly ask people for money when dealing with paperwork. In other words, are the people themselves paying these employees directly, not gorvement? And this is the reason why public administration in Vietnam so troublesome?
 Why don&#x27;t they set up agencies that charge high fees (special lanes) for people&#x27;s convenience? Instead of letting people being confused by the tricks of the staff to force people to pay bribes?

                              <span>I 28m am living in Houston, USA. I have noticed that it can be difficult to practice Vietnamese although I have been learning for some time. Often when I want to speak to the Viet people of Houston they often prefer to speak in English, yes I know that my Vietnamese is not perfect nor is my understanding and that dialect may be a barrier. At times I will ask they try to speak VNese with me even though I may struggle to understand. How do I make it known that I prefer to speak Vietnamese to improve my own understanding? 
 In houston we have many people speaking southern dialects and I have learned a northern dialect. I believe it is best to know and understand multiple dialects. I noticed that people will understand roughly what I am trying to say but out of politeness will not speak Vietnamese with me because they can tell from my speaking that maybe my understanding is not the best this happens most especially with viet kieu. 
 What are suggestions that you all would have to help me engage in normal conversation?

 I am looking for a Vietnamese native speaker for my two toddler age children. I&#x27;ve reviewed the various tutoring sites and understand they take a large cut of the fees and I would rather those fees go to the tutor. This would be online 2x a week. We&#x27;re in the States and can discuss times. Please DM if interested. 
 My apologies if this is not the right venue.

                              <span>In a souvenir shop in Vietnam, I found this small bottle of what seems to be a wet specimen of a baby cobra, or a snake whiskey? Not sure.
 The bottle is so small: 30 to 50ml max. The seller claims that the snake inside is real. I&#x27;m skeptical but it seems to be true. I also don&#x27;t mind if it isn&#x27;t since it costs less than 5$. 
 I bought four of them as souvenirs for my relatives back home, but now I am wondering if it will be ok to transport these internationally? Is it legal to do so?

                              <span>I&#x27;m tryng to learn Vietnamese, and like every beginner I struggle with the tones. My teacher suggested me to watch some cartoons/shows so I can get used to the speech, but I struggle to find things on Youtube with subtitles. Most of the videos have the auto-generated youtube subtitles, but they are pretty low quality and don&#x27;t always come synchronized with the speech. I&#x27;m looking for some cartoons (mostly because of the smaller vocabulary) that have subtitles on them put on by the creators, not auto generated. Any ideas on what should I search for / recommendations? Thanks in advance üòÄ

                              <span>Hello,
 I am from New Zealand.
 I will be traveling to Vietnam as part of my travels to South East Asia.
 Exchange rates and options in my country are horrible. None of the banks do exchange of currencies anymore, and the options left here are very slim, and which charge high transaction fees with bad exchange rates given.
 I was wondering if i could bring $NZD bank notes with me and exchange it in Vietnam? Are there currency exchanges in Hanoi that would take NZD currency??
 Appreciate any advice given, thank you!

                              <span>I‚Äôve visited vietnam around 10 times now. I think I want to create even more roots by going longer on my next trip, and spending a few months learning some Vietnamese.
 My question is, I‚Äôm thinking of staying in Hai Phong, Hanoi or around Da Nang to study. 
 Does someone have a school recommendation? And also, should I instead consider going to hcm to pick up the southern accent? (I‚Äôve always preferred the north)

 The Cups and glasses can be small tiny ones to very round ones. Now I&#x27;ve even seen mugs with coffee written on them and matching phins to go on top.

I only have few days off, and I&#x27;ve done some research and Haiphong was the only place where it was affordable and also Sunny. All other places are anticiapted to rain a lot. So I think I will go to Haiphong but I have very few information about it. Do you guys have any information? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Xin ch√†o, I&#x27;m a big foodie from Spain who&#x27;s traveling to vietnam in August, and I&#x27;d like to make the most of my culinary experience. I&#x27;d want to learn to recognize the main ingredients and dishes, and understand the essence of Vietnamese cuisine.
 The intention is to, when there, eat as much as possible in authentic places and street vendors.
 Could you recommend some ways to learn about the cuisine (books, Youtube channels, blogs...) or give me some advice on the culinary part of my trip in general? 
 C·∫£m ∆°n!

 I tried egg coffee in Hanoi and loved it. I want to let people in work try it but would rather make it at home. The recipe I found was vanilla extract, egg yolk and condensed milk whisked together. If I made this the night before and kept it in the fridge would it keep it&#x27;s consistency the next day or does it need to be made fresh?

                              <span>I have tried to send gifts to my fiancee in the past through advertised sites but her and her family do not approve. The main reason for disapproval is because they think the prices are outrageous. They recommend I use local vendors. The problem is that I do not speak or read Vietnamese; trying to learn it. I got recommendations before for vendors in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i but it is all through Facebook and there isn&#x27;t a direct payment option like in the states. Trying to avoid just sending money, seems it feels very impersonal. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi guys, I‚Äôm nee here. I‚Äôm a Vietnamese and currently living in the U.S. I want to bring a drone (mini 3 pro) to Vietnam to record my countryside, but I heard that there was problem when you arrive to the Danang International Airport specifically (HAN and SGN are known as friendly drone owners). Do you guys, who arrived at the DAD (international), have any problems with drone confiscation or have any stories about it? Please share your experience, so I can decide to bring it with me or just buy it after my arrival. Thank you so much

                              <span>In short, going Vietnam 18-20days end of July to mid Aug.
 Places been before: DN, Hoian, Hue, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Giang. (went before but dont mind using them as layover).
 I am planning to fly in from Saigon and fly out from Hanoi this time round. Have yet to book tickets
 Places i want to visit: Saigon!, Dalat!, Phong Nha! (4D tour).
 Places i can do without: Mekong Delta (AKA can tho?), Nha Trang, Mai Chau, Phu quoc(worth it?)
 My concern is Dalat to Phong Nha is a little detour, not too sure an efficient way to travel while passing by some other cities. I am considering Dalat to Hoi An 5D motorbike easyrider tour but feels a little expensive, then from Hoi An overnight bus to Phong Nha for 4D caving adventure and then Phong Nha to Mai Chau and to Hanoi back home. 
 It feels a little tired and what suggestions do u have? I can reroute my entire plan again

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been dating a Vietnamese girl for 3 months now since we met on a dating app. She&#x27;s working on a visa in my country. We&#x27;ve been going to cafe&#x27;s, weekend trips across my state, to local events like the show grounds and have an intimate relationship. However she refuses to call me boyfriend, even when strangers ask she clarifies I&#x27;m only &quot;her friend&quot; or &quot;her neighbour&quot;. When challenged she says she&#x27;s still deciding whether I&#x27;m a good person.
 At the same time she wants me to fly to her home city with her at the end of the year. And all her friends and colleagues from work say she talks about me often.
 Is this a cultural difference? Are women from Vietnam always so hesitant to call someone boyfriend?

 I&#x27;d also love to know if there are dishes/food that are hard to find outside of the region or are made differently in the North / South and if there are any specialties we should sample from a specific city.

                              <span>My 2 weeks in Vietnam‚Äôs close to its end. 
 I just want to say, Vietnamese food is unparalleled. I‚Äôm also Southeast Asian (Philippines), but the food here hits differently. 
 It‚Äôs always perfectly balanced. Flavors aren‚Äôt aggressive, yet the food is very flavorful. The servings are always just right. The food is filling, but not heavy on the belly. It‚Äôs literally perfect for me. 
 I only stayed in Hanoi and Saigon, but I had the most fun just eating, interacting with locals and travelers, and people-watching. Everything I did here was so self-indulgent lol. 
 I‚Äôll be back, Vietnam. Thank you for your rich history and culture. I learned a lot of your history after coming here, and I have huge respect for the people. 
 I will forever remember this place close to my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è.

                              <span>I live in my parents owned apartment in a local neighbourhood. I am currently staying here for another year during my time in Vietnam. Although the apartment allows pets, there is a significant number of residents who strongly dislike them and the residents are majority older generation. They often demonstrate closed-mindedness, rudeness, and narcissistic behavior. Additionally, the staff, including security guards and cleaners, engage in gossip and talk behind our backs. I have personally experienced consistent rudeness from an older female cleaner. She unnecessarily reprimanded me when I was about to walk my dog after exiting the lift while she was cleaning. I was unaware of her cleaning schedule, but since then I avoid walking my dog at that time. She has also spread rumors among other residents, falsely labeling my dog and me as dirty. It&#x27;s clear that she holds a personal grudge against me and my dog. I have been ignoring her but she constantly says it when I&#x27;m around and it is bothering me a bit.

That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d like to watch some Viet films. So can you five me recommendations. (It doesn&#x27;t have to have dubs as long as there&#x27;s English/Hungarian subtitles)
 Edit: Also could you tell me places where I can watch them for free? Thank you :)

(Junior positions) I would love to connect with individuals who have personal experience being sent to Vietnam as an expat or have similar IT-related experiences while living and working in Vietnam. Or can drop me any company names where i would have the possibility to work in Vietnam. If you or someone you know fits this description, I would greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations. Looking forward to hearing your stories and advice!

Do we need to mail her original green card to the consulate in Washington DC and it will be returned to her with the required documentation?

                              <span>4 people, wanting to take multiple grab bikes, at the same time. Like a convoy. 
 How would we go about this? 
 Each order separately, tell bikes 1-3 they need to wait for bike 4 to arrive, and then once bike 4 arrives all head off?
 Would this delay be acceptable to bikes 1-3? Is there some way to do this through the app itself?

                              <span>There is a report published recently by a analyst. They said between the three: Viettel, Mobifone and Vinaphone; Viettel wins consistency and core quality, while Vinaphone wins fastest speed almost 3x the second winner being Viettel. Mobifone eats dirt in almost every metric and I feel blind after reading that report. 
 You see, I&#x27;ve been using the same operator for more than a decade and I wonder if there is better fit for my needs, maybe you can find yours here too. I&#x27;m first:
 I use Mobifone.
 Connectivity is okay, worse on height, not much 5G. 
 Customer service is helpful and does available 24/7. 
 Good data package, I paid 300k VND per month for 8GB data daily. There are plenty options. 
 Their App works fine for all basic stuff you need, but the UI always feels like still in the Beta stage and not fully functional. That bugged me the most. 
 What&#x27;s your mobile plan and how is your experience?

 It‚Äôs kind of hard to search on Google since the forums are really old. I live around District 1, close to Pasteur. 
 If anyone knows, please let me know :) thank you!

                              <span>When I first came to Vietnam and actually saw these hats I thought they looked really impractical for some reason, and very fragile looking. Plus being in a tourist area and being obviously not Vietnamese I didn‚Äôt want to look like a tourist. 
 I get sun burn ridiculously easily and being on a dive boat doesn‚Äôt help. I gave in and ended up buying a non la out of pure desperation to keep the sun far away from me. Turns out they‚Äôre actually really useful and now I understand why I see so many women wear them.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m currently in the process of authenticating my documents to teach in Vietnam.
 Here&#x27;s the thing; I&#x27;ve already legalized/authenticated my degree but the problem remains with my teaching certificate because the document was issued by a US institution (university) and I&#x27;m not a US citizen besides, my country isn&#x27;t part of that hauge convention thing, so based on my research, i believe I can&#x27;t authenticate the certificate in the US embassy in my home country.
 There&#x27;s too much information online that I don&#x27;t even know where to start and how to properly authenticate it. Has anyone had this experience before? (A non-us citizen authenticating a US document). What should i do? I don&#x27;t want to fly to Vietnam before authenticating my TEFL, i know it would be much harder this way.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m traveling to Vietnam to visit my boyfriends family. I wanted to bring gifts but I don&#x27;t know what I can bring that&#x27;s not available in vietnam. My boyfriend has no idea because he hasn&#x27;t been there in more than ten years but he told me to not bring any clothing since they are produced in vietnam and are sold there cheaper (I wanted to buy Babys clothes for his cousin who gave birth recently).
 What are some things that you buy for your families in vietnam when you visit them? What are the most requested things? I read that gummy bears are very popular but I don&#x27;t want to only bring gummy bears. He doesn&#x27;t have lots of contact with his family so he&#x27;s too shy to ask.

 Discovered this YouTube channel recently and loving it. I just find the random conversations with customers so charming. Super interesting glimpse into the daily life of a Gojek driver.

 Don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re male, female, somewhere in-between, somewhere not in-between, religious, irreligious, Viet, non-Viet, communist, capitalist, or part of some Satanic sex cult (actually that&#x27;d be cool af).
 My IG handle is @benji_man_van if you need to do a background check to make sure I&#x27;m not a weirdo even though I am.
 Edit: Also this is my first time back in Vietnam since I was 6 years old. Nha Trang is so beautiful.

                              <span>Hi,
 I work for a company in Germany and have German citizenship (used to have Vietnamese citizenship). I&#x27;m planning to visit my family in Vietnam and work remotely for my German company from there later this year for about a month.
 The issue is that my company in Germany requires me to have a working permit in Vietnam, or an exempton for one, because according to them &quot;I&#x27;m working in Vietnam&quot;. 
 I have done some research, and it seems like:
 &quot; Working in Vietnam as a manager, executive, expert or technical worker for a period of work of less than 30 days and up to 3 times a year; &quot; may exempts a foreigner from needing a work permit (source https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/vietnam/human-resources-and-payroll/visa-and-employment-permits). 
 However, I have personally asked https://www.vietnam-visa.com. It seems that I&#x27;m not eligible to apply for an exemption of work permit since I don&#x27;t have a sponsor company in Vietnam and technically speaking, I don&#x27;t work for any company in Vietnam.
 Does anybody have any experience applying for an exemption of work permit in Vietnam or something similar?
 Best regards

                              <span>I (25f) am moving to Hanoi in August to teach English. I‚Äôve never been to Vietnam before so I‚Äôve been watching videos about teaching and life Vietnam and I am so excited to be moving there! 
 I do want to ask what advice would you give to someone moving to Vietnam? I already have a job lined up including my accommodation for the first month. My visa is in the process of being sorted and I‚Äôve started trying to learn Vietnamese. I‚Äôm wondering more about daily life, what there is to do, which online resources would you recommend for learning Vietnamese, etc?
 Bonus if you know where the best c√† ri g√† in Hanoi!

 Edited for English translation 
 Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a Vi·ªát kieu born overseas who‚Äôs only spoken Vi·ªát to their parents. My language an speaking is lacking as a result of this, and I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for some short novels or Vietnamese history books for me to get used to the language again! 
 Thanks a lot and let me know if I made any typos.

                              <span>This is my second time in Vietnam. The first time I visit Vietnam as a teenage I never heard of the word. I am currently in Vietnam for the second time as an adult and I hear the term Viet Kieu a lot.
 Viet Kieu is a person with Vietnamese blood that is living outside of Vietnam, whether they were born in Vietnam or another country. 
 Sometimes people call me a Viet Kieu or I will tell them that I am a Viet Kieu. Now that I think about it, is it a good thing or bad thing? I know is it a way to label us but I have been saying it with pride. 
 I know different people have their own opinions about Viet Kieu. People may like or dislike us, think we are rich, or expect us to bring gifts from our country to give to our relatives in Vietnam. They may look down on us because we escaped our home country due to the war or think we are lucky because we were able to create a life outside of Vietnam. We may or may not be rich in our country but the money exchange from our country to Vietnam makes us look rich.
 I rented an apartment with my family and they told me all the Viet Kieu lives in this apartment. My family told me girls will want us for citizenship. My mom told me not to tell people that I am in a Viet Kieu in public because I will get robbed.
 A lot of people try to talk to me in English. When I start talking to them in Vietnamese, they would tell me that they thought I was from overseas. I tell them I was born and live overseas. I do ask the locals about this in person but Reddit is a better platform to be straight up. Some people that I ask are the older generation that lived through the war or the new generation that were born after the war. 
 Give it to me straight. Give me your opinion. Is it a title I should wear with pride or embarrassment and shame?

                              <span>I was talking to my dad about Vietnamese pronouns and how different pronouns can feel more intimate and special.
 My favorite pronouns is m√¨nh/t√¥i which typically means the same and is used to refer to yourself but is also used by couples. I like its insinuation that your partner is a part of you and it&#x27;s very cute and endearing.
 Another interesting one is moi/toi which means me and you in French and was sometimes used by folks during the French colonialization of Vietnam.

 I have ridden dirt bikes before and had my own moped in Australia for a few years, and drove a moped in Bali a few times. Just wondering if this will be enough experience to make the drive?

                              <span>My husband and I are heading to Vietnam and are planning to stay for at least 3 months. We&#x27;ve been in Thailand for over a year and I was wondering about the cultural norms in Vietnam. In Thailand things like, &quot;saving face,&quot; being non-confrontational, feet low/head high, etc. are cultural norms/part of daily life. What are some Vietnamese cultural norms/do&#x27;s &amp; dont&#x27;s that we should know of? Thanks!

 Is anyone here using the starlink kit already? Can you share your experience with it (pricing, import fees, speed, connectivity issues and monthly payments if any etc) and if possible, the city you are living in? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I was born and raised in Vietnam, but I&#x27;ve spent a significant portion of my life living overseas. Now that I&#x27;m back in HCM City, I&#x27;m feeling a bit out of touch and I&#x27;m looking for advice on how to meet new people and make connections here.
 I know dating apps are popular these days, but I&#x27;m honestly not the best when it comes to texting and connecting with people I don&#x27;t know well. I prefer more personal interactions where I can get to know someone face-to-face.
 So, my question is, what are some effective ways for me to meet and connect with people in HCM city? Are there any local events, clubs, or communities that you would recommend joining? Maybe you know of specific places where people tend to gather and socialize? All suggestion or personal experience is welcome.
 p/s: I speak both english and vietnamese fluently.

But I‚Äôll be another one to remind you again based on my terrible dating experience. There are girls out there who will rob you! This girl took whatever she can from my apartment while I was napping and took off. And of course, the police don‚Äôt give a crap as usual. Badoo doesn‚Äôt give a crap. Everyone just sits back and enjoys a good story of how a dumb foreigner was robbed by a cunning Vietnamese girl. Take care my friends. I repeat.

                              <span>Calling the other on the phone only to sit on the phone in silence. 
 I&#x27;m sorry if you do this haha, but it&#x27;s so annoying to witness/be around when this is happening! For example: My aunt called my other aunt (whose house we were driving to which is less than 15 mins away) and put her on speakerphone and all I heard was my other aunt tussling dishes and food prepping for a house party. My dad and aunt do this too and my cousin told me her old bosses at the nail shop she used to work at do that too! If I&#x27;m around someone doing it I don&#x27;t even like to talk cause it feels like the other person silent on the other end of the phonecall is eavesdropping or that I&#x27;m intruding even though they&#x27;re sitting in silence lol. My cousin and I were talking about it but we didn&#x27;t have a good reason as to why. 
 What is the reason?!

                              <span>I am doing a 11 day trip and visiting these cities. Will be traveling by plane. About 3-4 days each country.
 I plan to stay the weekend in Hanoi for the night life.
 I know this route is odd as I am jumping from Cambodia and Vietnam but they were the cheapest flight with no layovers. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt want to do long bus trips considering my trip is short. 
 Has anyone done this route or something similar?
 I‚Äôm looking for recommendation on what to do and in which order. I‚Äôm getting little overwhelmed with the options I see. Considering this is a short trip, what do you think is an absolute must do? Time frame and cost would be good

                              <span>(Edit: the title is supposed to say &quot;Man needs help learning English&quot; not Vietnamese. I also posted this in r/Vietnamese and I guess the words got jumbled around in my head, sorry)
 I should start by saying that I am only assuming this man is Vietnamese, because I googled his name, Tran, and Google says it&#x27;s a Vietnamese name. 
 I work at a gym, and this man comes in to work out and use our massage chairs. Any time he needs to communicate something to me he uses Google translate, and he does know a few phrases like &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;good night,&quot; but today he brings his phone up to me and shows me his question, which is that he would like help learning English. 
 He asked for my phone number and I didn&#x27;t want to be rude, so I gave it to him, but he texted me saying he needs someone to help him learn English. 
 I&#x27;m not really a teacher, and I definitely don&#x27;t speak Vietnamese. I want to provide some sort of help, because he&#x27;s always so nice and patient when I&#x27;m helping with whatever he needs around the gym, but I&#x27;m at a loss for what to say. 
 I was hoping maybe reddit would be a good place to find people who understand Vietnamese culture, and might know what sort of help he is looking for specifically?
 (I have texted him asking if he is Vietnamese just to be sure. I really hope that doesn&#x27;t come off as rude. Just trying my best guys. Waiting on that response)
 (I flaired this as discussion but realistically a flair like &quot;language&quot; might be more apt. I picked what seemed to make the most sense out of the options, sorry if I didn&#x27;t use it right)

                              <span>Vietnamese born American here. I am currently solo traveling Vietnam from north to south. My family is from Saigon. When I travel or live with my family, I only get their point of view and bias opinions.
 Since I have been traveling the north solo, I have interacted with locals. It is hard to understand non-Saigon accent sometimes but I can understand enough to hold a conversation. I will tell them that Hanoi accent is hard to understand and that I learned Vietnamese from my family who is from Saigon. One person said that Hanoi Vietnamese is the proper way. Even the American War museum was so much different from American history. It shows how little I know about my roots.
 Please recommend your 3 top must read books. It can be about the war, history in general, culture, or anything.
 The books have to be in English because I cannot read Vietnamese lol.

 They say:
  
This shipment contains cosmetics. As articles 35 circular 06/2011/TT-BYT, consignee can only imports cosmetics with total customs value under 1,000,000VND. If it‚Äôs over 1,000,000VND, you must provide the import permit from Ministry of Health.
  
Can that really be right..?! You need a permit from the ministry of health? I found the referenced legislation here but I see no mention anywhere of a 1,000,000 limit on imports ü§∑

                              <span>I wonder if in Vietnam they are aware of what is called &quot;noise-induced hearing loss&quot;. It&#x27;s just that I was just wandering the internet and found a WHO document that says the Western Pacific (including Vietnam) is and will continue to be the most affected area. So in Vietnam people are aware of this and does the government make action to raise people&#x27;s awareness about this problem ? What is the way they do it?

                              <span>i grew up abroad and while my parents left about 50 years ago, they seem to hold a slight interest in french culture, but overall the only time we really encountered anything related to france was when speaking viet and running into the loanwords. they grew up shortly after vietnam was a french colony, so had a french-ish education and usually display a moderately positive idea of french things (like fashion, food, language, etc). but how do people nowadays generally think about france, whether viet in VN or viet abroad? i have read that the french presence in VN was quite violent and not just food/language. do many VN people today (especially older ones) still have any interest in france or french culture? are there many lingering ties to french culture in today‚Äôs vietnamese culture or society (other than the loanwords)? as a vietnamese, do you embrace it, feel indifferent about it, or have resentment towards it?

I have heard concerns like if you use your phone out on the streets it might get snatched etc or robbed. I am also born with a weak stomach so how likely am I to get food poisoning from street food or restaurants?

                              <span>Hi everyone! My name is Victor, from Saigon Dragon Studios. For a bit more than 2 years now we‚Äôve worked on the RTS game Space Tales, and today we‚Äôre making its Steam page public :)
 https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457960/Space_Tales/?beta&#x3D;0
 Quick background about us: we‚Äôve launched SDS in 2015, as an outsourcing studio specializing in video game 2D and 3D arts. Vietnam (and HCMC) are well known in the video game industry as several top outsourcing companies are located there. A ton of Vietnamese talents have worked on famous games/movies. Surprisingly however, there aren‚Äôt many studios in Vietnam who develop and publish their own games (‚Äì whenever I am in a game convention for example I always hear ‚Äòah yes Vietnam, it‚Äôs where Flappy Bird was made‚Äù, which really annoys me because it‚Äôs not representative of the talents Vietnam has.)
 A couple of years ago we decided to start working on our own game in parallel of our outsourcing services, and we wanted to do as much as possible in Vietnam (only music and sounds are being made elsewhere). We still have a lot of work to do on our game, but we would love to hear your feedback on what we have to show for now.
 The teaser for our game can also be watched on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;elHEmpUTcEk 
 Looking forward to receiving your feedback.

 Vietnamese legislators on June 27th finally agreed to extend the validity of tourist e-visas to 90 days and allow multiple entries. How this move affects the current situation?

                              <span>I‚Äôm 22 and was born in the US, my parents both immigrated from vietnam. I visited when I was 4 but don‚Äôt remember much except the blistering heat. My mom basically forced me to come with her this past June, and I was dreading it bc the time difference, the heat, and the fact that it‚Äôs more of a developing country and I‚Äôm so spoiled in the Us. Well that was so naive of me because I definitely had an unforgettable experience and vietnam blew me away. 
 We backpacked a bit through vietnam, we went to Saigon, Canh Tho, Cu Chi, Sapa, Hanoi, halong bay, phu quoc, Mekong, tay ninh. At first when I landed I couldn‚Äôt wait to get back home. But throughout the trip , the sights were in believable, the food amazing, the motorbikes were so fun, and just cruising through the streets people watching of the cities was so enjoyable. There was just so much to see culture wise as well and opened my eyes to a different lens of the world. and now that I‚Äôm back home I feel a small heartache which I wasn‚Äôt expecting. It‚Äôs been 2 days and I‚Äôm still thinking abt this trip
 Although some people were rude and inconsiderate, most were so kind, they treated me and my sister like celebrities. (I thought we looked viet but guess not lol) ppl were constantly approaching us saying we were beautiful. Also i noticed that everyone talks to each other like they already know each other, which is so different than in america. I loved vietnam and want to go back again. This trip holds a special place in my heart and I think will trigger me to start travelling internationally more because that was transformative

                              <span>I shipped a small package to a friend in Hanoi using USPS Priority Mail but haven&#x27;t gotten any tracking updates since May 26th.
 The last update was: 
 &quot;Dispatched from sorting center
 Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam&quot;
 Should I be worried it&#x27;s taken this long, is there something specific to Contact? I double checked just to see if the package got transferred to another carrier (VN post and EMS), but neither showed up anything.

                              <span>Hey everyone !
 I recently met, then started dating a wonderful girl from Vietnam. Her birthday is quite soon, i have my ideas on what to buy her, but I was wondering if theres any particular gift that a Vietnamese girl, or Vietnamese people might appreciate for their birthday. 
 It&#x27;s been a month or so, but we really, really appreciate each other a lot already, so something cheesy is ok too. That can include cooking. Already tried egg coffee and lemongrass chicken so far. She&#x27;s in her mid 20s if that helps, and we both live in Europe.
 Also, I wanted to give appreciation to you guys in general, I didn&#x27;t know much about Vietnam, but you guys are so nice and welcoming It&#x27;s scary, your country&#x27;s history is pretty humbling too. I can&#x27;t wait to be lucky enough to visit Hanoi one day !
 Thanks, in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m planning a trip in December. I spent six weeks in Central Vietnam about 10 years ago and I loved it! Unfortunately I&#x27;ve been struggling with health problems for the last couple of years, and so this trip is very much going to be a relax by the pool type of affair.
 I was considering Hoi An or potentially Sapa for a 10 day stay? The touristy nature of Hoi An is a bit confronting whereas the Northern mountain ranges are attractive as hell to me. Can anyone lend their opinion/give any recommendations for a resort-style stay that isn&#x27;t going to be busy to the point of stressful?
 Proposed Itinerary
 December 1st - 4th Fly into Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay for a few nights to recover from flight
 December 4th - 14th Bus/train/plane to destination and stay for 10 days
 December 14th - 17th Bus/train/plane back to Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay a few days before departure
 Additional Info
  
I should be able to manage around 5,000 steps each day
 Budget is around $4,000 AUD for two people for 17 days (not including flights)
 I&#x27;m used to travelling for the adventure so this style of travel will be very new to me. Anything luxurious + off the beaten path is very appealing!
  
Would appreciate any help! Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m traveling to da nang in morning 5.30 flight from ho chi Minh. My plan was to visit check-in to hotel and leave for bana hills as soon as I land in danang but I&#x27;ve not slept throughout night. Can you people suggest at what time I should travel from da nang to ba Na hills from city ? Is going there early morning 9-10 is must or we can enjoy same thing in evening 3-4pm too ? 
 Also where to buy bana hills tickets ? Online or directly from the hills ? 
 Thanks in advance and good morning.

I don&#x27;t have the new ID and the problem is I can&#x27;t take off work too long to go to Vietnam and wait for the new ID to process. Is there anyway to speed up the process? I&#x27;ve heard you can&#x27;t bribe to speed up the new ID since it&#x27;s all electronic and centralized now.

I know there is an inexpensive one that can be uncomfortable and then a little bit more pricey one. I would opt for the more comfy one for sure. Any tips or best time of year to do this? Thanks!!

                              <span>When viets who were born abroad come to vietnam, is it easy to distinguish if they grew up elsewhere? assuming they can speak the language, are they usually treated like foreigners or viewed differently from local-born viets? i was born during the diaspora and would really like to go to vietnam one day. VN was my first language, so i‚Äôm not worried about understanding the language but i probably have a bit of an accent and am not sure how i would blend in or if people would even recognize me as one (i‚Äôm kinda pale so people sometimes think im chinese lol). but i‚Äôm curious to know what it‚Äôs like for others in the same situation. if you were born somewhere else and then came to vietnam how was the experience? were you treated more as a vietnamese or as a foreigner?

                              <span>As Filipinos, we have this concept of bringing home goodies when we go visit one country, is there any prefered brands of coffee that I can bring home to give my family and friends? And even goodies in general from Saigon? 
 And where can I buy them in Saigon? Thank you.

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I&#x27;m in Hue for a few nights, looking forward to exploring the imperial city amongst other things soon. Was just thinking I might take myself to the cinema this week to watch the new Indiana Jones but not sure which one to go - there seems to be 4 in relatively close proximity to each other. Which one stands out amongst the pack and why?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I was walking down the street and a dog randomly bit just below my hand from behind. The skin was not pierced in any way and there was no wound apart from small red marks where the teeth were. From reading online apparently rabies can only be transmitted through penetration of the skin.
 I‚Äôm just feeling a bit concerned, I‚Äôm in Hanoi and don‚Äôt speak any Vietnamese apart from a few basic words and not sure where I could go to explain my issue
 Hope this post is appropriate for the sub, just didn‚Äôt know where else to ask
 Thank you
 EDIT - thanks so much to everyone for the advice, I‚Äôm heading to an international hospital and have my documents ready. Really appreciate everyone‚Äôs support on this post it means a lot üôè
 EDIT 2 - Just got my first jab and now have a schedule for the next 4! Feeling much more at ease now

Is there some sort of cultural opposition to wearing headphones ??? My title is obviously sarcastic lol but I really don‚Äôt get it

 I am an 18 year old male and went to a Catfe during my trip to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam (June 19). While I was there I tried petting a new cat that was introduced to the Catfe. Before being able to pet the cat, a girl just so happened to warn me that cat was new and that it bites. I decided to pet it anyway and ended up getting scratched, but what I kept thinking about afterwards was how attractive that girls voice sounded. I didn&#x27;t think about starting a conversation because I wanted to see more cats, but the more I think about that situation, the more I think about how I should have approached that girl in pink overalls. Not only was her voice pretty, but she was beautiful too and even her outfit was awesome. If this ever reaches her I would consider it a miracle.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m building an app to learn foreign languages by reading books, called FLReader, and I&#x27;m looking for people who could help me improve it by using it and giving me feedback.
 It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, I think. You either upload an epub or download one from our server. Then you just click on the words and it will translate the word and the phrase.
 You can download it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.jorgeperezgomez.flreader2
 Future versions will store the words for future review, provide basic lessons on grammar so the user can read the book, and so on. But I wanted to share the app first and find early adopters who could give me some feedback about how it can be improved.
 We also have a reddit sub where people will be able to tell us what they think, ask for new features and so on: https://www.reddit.com/r/FLReader/

 I&#x27;m travelling to Vietnam this summer and I need to get from Ninh Binh to Halong Bay and then from Halong Bay to Hanoi.
 We read online that it is the best option to book buses and 12go.asia was often recommended. Just wanted to check if anyone has experience with this site and can suggest one of the many travel companies. 
 Thanks in advance

 PS: We prefer much more a trekking-nature based travel than a relaxed one passing the days by the sea

                              <span>hey guys, is october/november still good time to visit vietnam and do the whole country tour? our base would be hanoi most of the time as i have family there but i also wanted to go to HCMC and if possible to mountains in central part of vietnam
 i am planning to visit vietnam with my friends (and be kind of guide as i have vietnamese roots) but due to my personal reasons, we might have to postpone the trip for october/november
 we didnt buy tickets or anything but my friends dont like the idea of postponing things if not necessary (which i understand), but i might be a bit too financialy unstable and work stressed in march/april, thats why i suggested possible postponing for october/november
 the thing is that i want to provide them with great experience and memories but also personally, it would be better for me in october/november and i am considering to be a bit selfish for a change and do it in october/november, however i do not want them to go there and experience unpleasant weather the whole time (understandably, it will be raining in some places)
 can i still sell them the idea of great trip even though it would be in october/november instead of march/april (kind of knowing that march/april are ideal months for visit)
 thanks for your opinions:)

                              <span>I&#x27;d love to take a day trip from HCMC to see the Cao Dai temple in Tay Ninh. I&#x27;m not comfortable renting a bike and driving myself up, so I&#x27;m trying to arrange transportation.
 I&#x27;ve tried searching on Google for tours/vans etc, but they&#x27;re all $100+. Same with Airbnb Experiences. Seems like a rip-off. I don&#x27;t need hand-holding through the temple, just the transportation up and back.
 All of the tourist-oriented shops around the city look like total scams, so I haven&#x27;t bothered with these either.
 Also considered using Grab but it&#x27;s not really designed for long distances... I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;d get stranded out there.
 Anything I&#x27;m missing? Or do I really need to rent my own vehicle to take this trip?

                              <span>The more people I meet here, the most animated stories are usually about meeting their husband or wife /partners..it usually involves very high drama - the guy fighting off jealous rivals, the girl fighting with parents or hating the guy initially..it seems relationship stories have outsized importance for Vietnamese.. or am I imagining it?

                              <span>I was walking through the street at night with my friend and a woman with motorcycle approached to us and asked about boom boom (massage). I said no and go away and thought she was gone. But she didn&#x27;t go away, she came back and suddenly touched my thigh and I immediately shake her off. 
 I didn&#x27;t realize my phone was stolen at that time, but I realized it was gone at that time she touched me. It happened on Thursday and today, I find out that thief logged in to my Apple account and deleted what I registered as stolen phone. 
 I bought my Iphone 14 pro 4 months ago and now it&#x27;s gone lol. I should have more careful about my things, but at I feel so bad about what happened to me beyond money. One of the worst moment of my life so far.

                              <span>I never got a driver license in my home country so when I got married my wife(who is Vietnamese) decided it would be best to get a drivers license in Vietnam. The theory test which is all in Vietnamese of course involved me studying and memorizing answers for 6 months. As a result I was able to easily pass it along with the theory test. Despite being an inexperienced driver I thought that tge practical test would be a piece of cake. But I&#x27;ve just failed my 4th test in 4 months. I feel hopeless and useless. My wife passed it after the first try and really can&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t pass it. To make things worse my Vietnamese in laws and all their friends and relatives are making feel awful about not passing the test.
 I am starting to feel hopeless and depressed and I feel really pressured by everyone around me to pass. I do a practice run the day before I take the test everytime and I am usually able to pass with 100 points but when it comes to the test I always end up messing something up. Today I even failed within the first two minutes. The other times I was actually pretty close to passing but messed up. I have gone around the course on my own many times and have no issue passing. I don&#x27;t know whats wrong with me.

I flew there specifically for this trip and spent four nights on the loop and a few nights in Hanoi on either side. I can&#x27;t help but shake the feeling that I still have a lot left to see in Vietnam when I am able to return!
 I took so much useful information from this awesome community when planning my trip to Ha Giang, so I wanted to return the favour and take some time to give something back. Hopefully helping/inspiring others to plan their Ha Giang trip, too.

                              <span>I will be moving to Hanoi at the end of August and I&#x27;m wondering about the dating scene there.
 Ideally, I&#x27;m looking to build something serious but not necessarily with a local. I&#x27;m rather Western European in my expectations and ways. . . 
 My questions are roughly. . .
  
if you found your significant other in Vietnam, how/where was that?
 
how is the dating process? (I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s extremely slow) Are the kind of locals willing to move faster and/or hook-up, the same kind that you&#x27;d want to date or not at all?
 
from dating apps: first dates as coffee dates or wine/cocktail dates? Or something else? (I never invite ppl over directly from apps - I need to feel a personal connection first and also for safety reasons)
 
is going to a bar/club alone a thing? Or only some clubs/bars are good for this?
 
ultimately, where do you meet people and socialize? I tend to do a lot of &quot;expat event&quot; kind of things but, depending on the country, the ppl that show up are not necessarily the nicest.
 
would it be very limiting to try and date only other expats?
 
finally, what pitfalls you&#x27;d warn another foreigner about?
 
 No need to answer each and every. I just want to get an overall impression of what to expect.

                              <span>I was browsing some of the Vinfast model and apparently on top of the price for the vehicle itself, you have to buy the battery or pay a monthly subscription for it. That sounds like it going to be more expensive than normal motorcycle.
 Is this popular/economical?

                              <span>Hello~
 So I&#x27;ve heard that pho is can be prepared very differently depending on what area of Vietnam you are in, so I had the idea of doing a whole-country pho tour later this year. Start at the top/bottom and make my way to the other side while trying pho (and other food of course) in different cities.
 So I have a few questions, especially for people who have more experience with Vietnam and trying food in different areas of the country!
  
Do you think this is a fine idea, or a waste of time? Is pho really that different depending on what part of Vietnam you are in, or is it mostly the same?
 Which areas (or specific restaurants) would you recommend I try for a complete experience?
 Are there any other regional foods that you recommend I try on this journey?
  
I will be trying to document as much of this as possible, so I will definitely come back with my thoughts and feedback on how different they actually were, my favorites, etc!

Is it common for most Pixar/Disney movies to get Vietnamese voice actors for the dubbing these days? Can anyone suggest some other Western movies for kids with Vietnamese voice dubs? Thank you!

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to visit Vietnam since I was 6 years old. About 5 years ago my parents divorced and my dad figured it was time to go back to Nha Trang. Last week I received news that he had fallen incredibly ill so I booked a last minute trip to Vietnam to visit him for about 3 weeks. Although this isn&#x27;t exactly a vacation as I plan on helping to care for my dad, I&#x27;m sure there will still be plenty of opportunities to go exploring and get back in touch with my Vietnamese heritage.
 Given that I haven&#x27;t gone by since I was 6 and that I&#x27;m from California, I really have no idea how to prepare. What should I bring? What should I be cautious about? What are some dos and don&#x27;ts? I&#x27;m a pretty open-minded eater and literally wish to try all the things. Any recommendations?
 Other things about me:
 My Vietnamese is decent, I understand the southern accent very well and can get by in terms of speaking, but things get a little rough if the other person has a northern accent. If the other person has a central accent, no way lol. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t read Vietnamese either.
 I&#x27;m terrible at dealing with the heat but can manage if I have to.
 I&#x27;m not taking days off work and plan to work (I&#x27;m a software engineer director) as well. How&#x27;s the coffee shop scene over in Nha Trang?
 Any recommendations on what I must do over there on this last minute unplanned trip would also be appreciated!

 Currently we are planning on visiting HCM City, Thap Cham, Hoi An, Danang and Hue.

                              <span>I&#x27;m taking my now wife to Vietnam for our honeymoon. We generally like to end a major trip somewhere we can just lounge and hang out together. We considered Phuket, but don&#x27;t want to leave Vietnam if we don&#x27;t have to. We&#x27;ve looked into many beaches, but see so many conflicting opinions.
 Any recs?

                              <span>Hello!
 I was offered a job in market research for a big international corporation that has an office in HCM.
 I&#x27;m from Romania and I saw on Numbeo the comparison between my city (Bucharest) &amp; HCM, but an advice from people living there would be very helpful. 
 I would want to rent a 1 room apartment/studio in district 1, 5 or 10, which are close to my job. I don&#x27; want a luxurios life style but I would probably eat out often, go in bars, experience the local culture, travel and overall want to live a confortable life. Not be very aware of every dollar spent.
 Is it enough 1000$ to do all that (pay rent, travel in vietnam, eat out, drink, local transport, groceries, etc,)?

                              <span>Hi, I am a UK citizen and am allowed into Vietnam without a visa for 15 days. To be clear, I DO NOT currently have a visa, but I will be overstaying for 2 days (17 days in total, had mistakes with e-visa application) and want to know what has happened with other people and their experiences when trying to exit Vietnam.
 Will I have to pay a fine and how much? Will I get a mark on my passport and not allowed to re-enter Vietnam?
 Any advice would be appreciated, many thanks.

                              <span>I bought an E Visa and bought it for the wrong month (I know my fault). This Visa still covers my entry and a couple of days but not my exit. I‚Äôve applied for a new Visa that will only come after my entry. What are the attitudes toward this? Would I be able to just purchase another Visa at Immigration without much hassle? Or will I be okay and my other visa can come whilst I am still there. 
 Thank you!

 Is Grab reliable in nin binh? I went to Mua cave today and had to walk a few km outside of the cave to get a Grab because there was none in my area haha
 Also! I know I will be getting scammed when going into no name taxis, but I saw them earlier, is it still safe to go with them despite paying a higher price?

                              <span>Hello! I have been in Vietnam for a month now, and want to learn the language better as I want to have better interactions with locals and respect their land. I want to show the people here that I‚Äôm not a foreigner who only speaks English.
 Here‚Äôs the thing - I‚Äôm doing job interviews at the moment trying to get a job, but have limited money at the moment. I did a trial lesson at a centre, and after the lesson they asked if I wanted to pay for my tuition fees then and there. The fees were 19.6 for 80 hours (I believe?) but I told them I don‚Äôt have the money for it currently due to finding work and not employed. I really want to start learning as soon as possible, but really struggle with apps such as Duolingo and resources like YouTube. I can‚Äôt learn anything from there - I get super distracted because of my ADHD and prefer in-class.
 Do you have any suggestions, or should I just wait until I start getting a salary and have more money? It‚Äôs making me a little sad that I only speak English and want to learn the language because I feel like I‚Äôm experience 1/50th of the life here‚Ä¶

                              <span>Greetings. 
 My wife is currently holds a U.S. green card but she is a Vietnamese citizen. She went to Vietnam in the beginning of May to visit her family after graduating and starting her job in August. She figured while she was there she would renew her passport (Expired in June of 2023). Unknown to us that there‚Äôs a shortage issue with the newer ID there and she can only renew her passport using that newer ID. It‚Äôs been a month and a half, there‚Äôs no sign of her getting the ID. Is there something she can do so that she can return back to the U.S. more urgently? Or rather what‚Äôs the average wait time for the ID to get processed, printed, and shipped? For future planning. 
 Thank you in advance.

It is a middle aged couple, husband and wife, no young children. Any recommendations are appreciated. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi everyone. I‚Äôm scheduling to vist Danang for 4 days next week. The weather forecast is saying that it‚Äôll rain every single day while I‚Äôm there. What the rain looks like it Danang? Will it rain hard and long or just pouring down and stop? I‚Äôm a bit disappointed with the weather, to be honest. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Well duh... It&#x27;s south east Asia in June! 
 I&#x27;m used to colder temperatures (19 Celsius) so hanoi was a big contrast. I like to go about early mornings and it&#x27;s a lovely city. I was told &quot;oh you&#x27;ll get used to it&quot;. I noticed some of yall seem cool as a cucumber out in the unshaded areas, not a drop of sweat. Then I see others with fans out. Then I see others bolting into air conditioned buildings just drenched. How are y&#x27;all handling this heat? I&#x27;ve been handling it by just putting my hair up, going out and about earlier in the mornings, hydrating, fan and something to wipe my sweat up from my vitiligo&#x27;d face.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I‚Äôve signed up for a tour around Hue and surrounding areas tomorrow with a guy who approached us on the street. He had a photo album and multiple books of hand written testimonies, all very positive!
 I‚Äôm now just wondering, was that kind of a dumb thing to do, not going through an official tour operator or is this kind of normal? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I plan to stay and work (write) in Vietnam for a month. The earliest I can go is mid-October and the latest I can return is the first week of January. I want to mainly stay in one place. I&#x27;d really like to hit the beach maybe every second day as well. 
 Is there any place that will have decent whether in Vietnam during this time, is good for digital nomads (mostly cafes or co-working spaces that are good for laptop -work) and near a beach?
 I initially had planned to go to Da nang but now read that the weather will be very wet

                              <span>Hi r/vietnam. I will be visiting HCM next week and I&#x27;m planning to buy a Samsung phone because it&#x27;s cheaper there than here in the Philippines where I live. I was initially planning to order it online and have it delivered to Bitexco Tower or any nearby branch but I can&#x27;t proceed with the website order page. From step 2 shipment details, it doesnt proceed to step 3 select payment. So I might just check and buy it in the actual Samsung Store. Is it true that you cannot buy in the Bitexco branch? The other nearest to my hotel is the 134 Nguyen Thai Hoc St. branch. Anyway, can anyone check the latest price of Samsung S23+ in HCM? I just wanted to check if it&#x27;s the same as the one in store. Also, if this is the wrong sub to post this inquiry, please help me identify the correct one.
 Since I&#x27;m already here, any tips on my upcoming trip? Previously went to Hanoi already. Can anyone perhaps help me identify the correct sequence of how I should plan my route/itinerary to visit the most famous spots in the city? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Was talking with my partner about maybe going to a Japanese place to eat with their little brother, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if the little brother would necessarily like the place. I then asked, ‚ÄúDoes he know how to eat it?‚Äù
 And my partner seemed to be quite confused. They were just kind of like, ‚ÄúYes, he knows how to use chopsticks?? And you just chew and swallow??‚Äù
 There seems to be some confusion since I directly translated, ‚ÄúBi·∫øt ƒÉn kh√¥ng?‚Äù into English as opposed to saying something like ‚ÄúOh would this fit his palette?‚Äù
 So my question is- how would you go about translating/explaining ‚Äúbi·∫øt ƒÉn kh√¥ng?‚Äù to someone who doesn‚Äôt speak Vietnamese?

 I was wondering if someone could give me some advice on how to get from Siem Reap to Ho Chi Min City? Or what stops would be necessary along the way (like border crossing) to make it without breaking the bank? Options for busses seem pretty limited and but doable price wise, any suggestions would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m an English teacher who&#x27;s been living in HCMC for about 5 month&#x27;s now and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the experience living here.
 But since I&#x27;ve visited all of the main sights like Palace of reunification, war remnants museum, Landmark 81 and a few temples in D5, I&#x27;m getting quite bored and I want to find other things to do here.
 I plan on going to other parts of the country but at the moment I only work in the evening during the week so it makes it harder to find time when looking at traveling around Vietnam.
 What can anyone recommend to do here? Any hidden gems?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I assumed they were pro-France because 1. the South Vietnamese government was backed by France 2. I think a third of France&#x27;s army in the Indochina War were Vietnamese who relocated to the South. 3. they have a Catholic majority.
 But from talking to South Vietnamese supporters it sounds like they also hate France too. Yet the French flag was raised throughout South Vietnam. Did the South Vietnamese want to expel ALL foreign occupiers or did they want joint cooperation? Was the North more nationalistic than the South?
 To me the North sounds a lot more like the American founding fathers and the South were more interested in neocolonialism.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Going to have a 13hr25min layover at Ho Chi Minh airport. 
 However, it&#x27;s an overnight layover between 9:25pm to 10:50am the next day and I can&#x27;t get a day tour or visiting tourist attractions because of that. 
 So, what&#x27;s your suggestion? Maybe I can go to some night street market before 12 then head to some bar/clubs or hotel? What are the places that I can go at late night to look around? 
 Thanks a lot

                              <span>I live a great life in the U.S. but as I am sitting at work, I still think about moving back to Vietnam or how to do so in the future. This obsession has been going on for years now.
 I&#x27;m aware of all the pros and cons, it&#x27;s just that I have this strange yearning to be there. My mom passed away last year and her family is still in Vietnam. We are very close and I want to live near her family before they all pass away as well. They are one connection I have left with her.
 The main issue is that I won&#x27;t be able to get more than 3-4 weeks vacation off each year from work, and tickets will cost around 8k now. The flight is so long too just for a trip where we&#x27;ll be spending at least one week with jetlag and stomach issues. Plus, my wife wants to go on vacations/beaches while I just want to near Quan 7 with the relatives.
 I&#x27;ve thought about moving to Orange County or Houston to ease this feeling, but those Vietnamese cities just don&#x27;t feel the same. 
 I know the future is far brighter in 15 years for the family if I stay in the U.S., I just feel sad each day working. I spend hours thinking about having enough money to live in Vietnam without worrying about the future.
 It&#x27;s not rose-tinted glasses either, I worked remotely and had lived in Vietnam for 6 months recently with my wife/child. It was great. I know education and healthcare might be a problem later on. Waking up early for coffee and breakfast while watching the crazy traffic, going out to eat seafood/hot pot at night - that just can&#x27;t be beaten.
 I suppose I&#x27;m just ranting and being too greedy. I can always get a significant pay cut/career limitation and get a remote job to live in Vietnam. It&#x27;s just that I want what&#x27;s best for my family/kid&#x27;s future as well.
 Does anyone(especially the Viet Kieus) feel the same way?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m staying in Saigon for one month (work) and need to see some greenness.. am desperate to go to cat tien but am not keen on turning up at the bus station without knowing the times (i&#x27;ve seen Mien Dong Bus Station to cat tien is direct?). 
 Anyone know how I can find out the bus times,, &amp; any reccomendations for places to stay would also be really appreciated ((was thinking cat tien eco backpackers hostel ?) . Im travelling alone and have been put off of homestays after being put in a room on my own with a v creepy man,, so I&#x27;d prefer to share a room with a few people at least. 
 Any general advice would be really appreciated (ie. things you&#x27;ve done there and loved - nighttime jungle watch ?.. waterfalls, etc?)) ++ I &lt;3 hiking 
 :) Thank you !

Is this just another example of holier-than-thou western privilege speaking, or is ice-borne illness actually something to be concerned about? Especially curious what locals think.

                              <span>Hi everyone. Do you also consider the people of Champa as your ancestors or only the kinh people, becuase I have read that the Champa people were assimilated when Champa was conquered by Dai Viet. Viet culture such as clothingsetc were imposed on them. This means that south vietnam people are also related genetically to the austronesians (PH, IND, MLY). Is the Champa civilization also taught in schools as a part of vietnamese culture?

                              <span>A parent named Le Mau Duyen has been fined 6.5 million VND for physically assaulting his child&#x27;s teacher. The assault was alleged because the child received the teacher&#x27;s &quot;average conduct&quot; rating.
 This assessment was given to the student due to an incident where the student insulted the teacher after arriving late to class. The parent, persistently blaming the teacher for hindering their child&#x27;s enrollment in police schools, where ‚Äúgood level‚Äù conduct is required, finally resorted to physically attacking the teacher.
 In Vietnam, students are evaluated based on their academic performance and conduct, using a system with four levels: Good, Fair, Average, and Weak.
 What do you think about it?

                              <span>My Vietnemese girlfriend and I recently had a baby, who was born in Vietnam. We both want our child to have her Western first-name and my family name as her last name listed on her Vietnemese birth certificate.
 I have read on the Consulate website that if we provide documentation that we are obtaining a CRBA for US citizenship for our child, that we can follow the US naming standards on our child‚Äôs Vietnemese birth certificate.
 Has anyone had experience with this? Thank you in advance!

 Has anyone ever done that? Was there any trouble with customs/tax, etc at all?

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning to have eye laser surgery done in Saigon but not sure how safe it is to do it here, considering it is considerably cheaper than in the west. 
 Also which hospitals are trustworthy? A few people recommended Benh viet mat Sai Gon which seems to be owned by the government and has done a lot of surgeries. 
 I was also wondering whether I should go for the lasik option (cost like 20m VND) or Relex smile (50m vnd). Relex smile supposed to have faster recovery time and fewer complication risks but require a skilled surgeon, which again I&#x27;m not so sure

                              <span>My wife and I just returned from a month long trip in Vietnam and her hometown of Saigon. We had an amazing time. Now that we‚Äôve been home in the states for 2 weeks she just got a call from a number her caller ID says was the Vietnamese Embassy. They claimed that someone was using her name/info in Vietnam to scam people and that she needed to work with the police in Vietnam to clear her name. They transferred her to a police station in Vietnam and the police officer used Viber to video talk with my wife in full uniform. She declined when he started asking for passport information. He said if she does not trust it she can investigate herself or find another way to have it investigated. Has anyone got a call like this before? The phone numbers check out online but this just screams scam to me. Just looking for advice and how to move forward with this?

I drink plenty of water, i tired drinking ice, coffee,coconut water, avocado, fruits‚Ä¶anything you can imagine that someone should avoid for food poisoning‚Ä¶nothing is helping me. Are laxatives here too strong for western people? 
 I have not changed my diet as i am vegetarian‚Ä¶but my stomach looks like I swallowed a watermelon.

Right now we are in M·ªôc Ch√¢u and there are so many restaurants and hotels everywhere, but basically no guests anywhere. How can the people even afford to pay the electricity bill?

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m sorry for the silly question, but I&#x27;m currently at the transit area of Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Ho Chi Minh City and looking for some food options that are suitable for vegetarian. 
 Saw this Veggie and Cheese Burger at the Burger King. I&#x27;m wondering if this suitable for vegetarians? No animal fat or meat. I&#x27;m okay with eggs. Should I just get the fries instead? Hope someone can comment.

                              <span>So I have lived in Ha Noi for 5 years and I have visited Saigon many times but I have always been interested in why Saigon doesn&#x27;t seem to have an architetural equivalent to the Hoan Kiem and Ba Dinh in Ha Noi(even parts of Ha Dong old town in fact)
 The thing that gets me is that Saigon always had more french influence then Ha Noi. It was directly governed by Paris as opposed to the rest of Vietnam which was under harsher colonial rule. It was the center of french colonial life in Indochina with the French having their tennis clubs and Rugby teams.
 Yet I haven&#x27;t seen as many old french mansions(of course there are lots of old government buildings but less so then Ha Noi)

                              <span>...in a good way. Maybe I sound like the typical tourist, but I&#x27;ve been here three weeks after flying in from India as a solo woman traveller. Everything from the food to the people are top notch. I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s because I come from a country where women who drink and smoke and walk the streets late at night are perennially unsafe, but being here is simply so liberating. I haven&#x27;t travelled the world much, but I&#x27;ve been to the Middle East, Singapore, and Germany, and none of them compare. Being here is a cultural shock in a good way.
 I know this post is vague, but I just wanted to say thank you so much wherever I could and to whomever I could, hence me doing so here. Vietnamese people are the warmest, most down to earth people I&#x27;ve come across üôèüèΩ I hope to keep visiting and learn the language someday.

 TLDR: Is buying real estate in Vietnam a good idea? How to convey to parents that I want to focus on buying a house in the US instead of Vietnam? and that also I&#x27;m getting married?
 Context:
 I am 28 years old, the firstborn son of Vietnamese parents. I moved over to the US for college, luckily got a job, and currently live in a Very High Cost of Living city in the US (think Silicon Valley, New York, DC, Boston etc.) earning 100k salary. I have my gf (also Vietnamese) living with me and my company is in the process of applying for my Green Card (US Permanent Resident) while I&#x27;m on H1B visa. My parents (mum 50, dad 5‚Ä¶</span>

 Right now I use a workaround at translate.google.com using their English symnonyms feature and then look for Vietnamese words for those words but it&#x27;s quite timeconsuming and sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t work (no symnonym for either English or Vietnamese listed).

                              <span>Will be flying into Hanoi soon and looking to explore the northern part of vietnam (Halong bay, Ninh Binh) but I heard that the region has recently been suffering from power cuts due to the hot weather. How‚Äôs the situation now? Should it be something to worry about? If so, would I be better off heading to central/southern regions? Thanks!

                              <span>Sorry if this is a stupid question but tomorrow is my last day in this beautiful country and I want to spend a good portion of the day relaxing and sipping on cold and sweet coconut water in a chilled out spot that has AC. Hope I don&#x27;t sound weird. I don&#x27;t get coconut water in my country and I&#x27;m obsessed with it. This picture is from today&#x27;s visit to Pho Viet Nam. Pho was great but that coconut was amazing. PS. I&#x27;m in district 3 near vuon chuoi market but don&#x27;t mind taking grab. Thank you.
