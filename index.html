                              <span>Hello, for context I&#x27;m người Việt born in the US (việt kiều i guess haha), moved to Saigon for ages 4-12, then back to the states for the rest of middle school, high school, uni, and now work here. My parents are from mixed backgrounds, dad a boat refugee from a military family and mom a very upperclass business family in real estate. I&#x27;ve considered moving back after getting a job offer but ultimately decided not to purely because it wouldn&#x27;t further my career, at least not in the industry I&#x27;m in. Really did consider it though since I got lots of family there too
 That being said, I do have very mixed feelings of the current government. On one hand, they freed us from all our colonizers which is something I think all of us feel very proud of and it just feels liberating, you know, knowing…</span>

 For my job it&#x27;s important to use ChatGPT, as far as Microsoft blocked the product for Vietnam, I should use it via VPN and Telegram bots.
 However, maybe you know a more convinient way?

                              <span>It probably hasnt been discussed on here much, but curious to see thoughts on the gender disparity.
 Vietnam has the 5th highest in the world , with 111.4 male births (currently) to every 100 females: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sex-ratio-at-birth?tab&#x3D;table
 This has been a social trend in the country for 30-35 years, but it has accelerated dramatically over the past 10-20 years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Vietnam#/media/File%3AVietnam_population_pyramid_01.04.2019.png
 Any thoughts on this? I can imagine some pretty concerning social issues arising from this in future (if not already)

                              <span>Sorry if this is not an appropriate place to post this, but I wasn’t sure what other subreddit to post this to.
 I met a Vietnamese guy on a tour last year in South America. We stayed in touch and when I went over to Thailand, we decided to meet up there. I’ve noticed that he is not that polite to hotel and restaurant staff as well as drivers. For example, he doesn’t say thank you when staff brings his drink or food to the table ever. He doesn’t say thank you when we are leaving the restaurant and they are saying thank you and goodbye. He’s not mean to them or anything, he simply ignores them. We hired a driver and instead of walking a few meters to meet the driver, he insisted the driver come into a very tight spot even though it was super inconvenient for the driver to have to back out. I tried to tell him we can just walk up to a more convenient spot and he said no, that we are paying the guy so we will wait for him to come to us.
 I’m wondering if this is just a cultural thing? I am ethnically Vietnamese, however I grew up in the US and my attitude is completely different (I’ve also worked in the hospitality industry so maybe I’m hypersensitive to this). I grew up being taught to be extra nice to hospitality workers because they work very hard but make very little. I get a sense from him that he sees them as beneath them. Is this a common attitude towards staff in Vietnam?

                              <span>Although there is some similarity to other neighboring countries, our culture as well as clothing still have clear differences. For example, Vietnamese smoke Thuốc Lào, eat Trầu, dye their teeth black, wear darker color outside and colorful inner Áo Mớ Ba Mớ Bảy, and hair keep hair loose. In clothing, we have many hats like Nón Quai Thao, Nón Đinh Tự, Toàn Hoa etc. Just like the chest wrap skirt in the video, we Vietnamese use it with a Round collar robe - Áo Viên Lĩnh inside with hair covering fabric; while others don&#x27;t.
 The project takes 1 year to complete and more than 5000$. All are self-funded. If you are interested, please support the full video here on Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;B06Pvic1TM0.

                              <span>Hello,
 I don&#x27;t want to be disrespectful, but I have a sincere question. 
 I spent a night in a sleeping bus in a lower cabin and the guys from the company had no choice but to sleep on the ground between cabins. One guy spent the entire night spreading his legs right and left, and doing so, he was touching my bottom all night long. I could not sleep because it made me feel really inconfortable. I tried many times to push his legs, but he would do it again, and again and again. 
 I don&#x27;t understand, because I thought it was very disrespectful to touch people of the opposite sex?
 Is it normal? How should I react if it happens again? Can I ask him to stop doing it or would he be angry? 
 Thank you for your answers

                              <span>Serious question here. Why do so many Vietnamese burn garbage? Outside of the traffic situation, burning of things and the resulting air pollution it causes is without a doubt the most negative aspect of this amazing country. I don’t get it as everything I have seen on fire could have easily been put on virtually any curb for pickup by the garbage crews at least in the cities where smoke impacts a lot of people. 
 It makes me so mad as it not only affects my health, but more so, that of babies and children who are more vulnerable plus ALL of you who live here. Why is this not something the government is cracking down on as the trickle down health effects surely are taking a toll on the nation...even just cognatively as it effects your brain too. Plus, who wants to constantly be getting whiffs of burning plastics and whatnot on the daily? It is 2023 and we KNOW better, so why the ignorance in this particular area here? 
 If you burn things on the regular basis…why? Can you please shed some light as to your motivations? 
 From Wikipedia:
 “The World Health Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.[6] Studies published in March 2019 indicated that the number may be around 8.8 million.[127] A 2022 review concluded that air pollution was responsible for 6.67 (5.90–7.49) million premature deaths in 2019. It concluded that since 2015 little real progress against (superordinate) pollution, which remained at ~9 million earlier deaths, can be identified.[128][19]00090-0-19) Causes of deaths include strokes, heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections.[6]&quot;

                              <span>As the title suggests. I’ll be arriving in Hanoi on an afternoon and would be looking to navigate to Ha long bay that very moment.
 Planning on spending an evening + next day there. Recommendations for a day cruise or a cruise which maybe starts in the evening and goes up until the next day in the evening?
 Looking to do activites such as Kayaking and swimming.

                              <span>Hoping someone has some experience on what may be the best approach. For my last two days in Vietnam, I&#x27;m struggling to decide on two different scenarios. I&#x27;m not deterred by long days and aim to do as much as I can. I&#x27;ve heard Ha Long Bay is more touristy, so I&#x27;d like to avoid that if possible. But here are what I&#x27;ve found to be the best scenarios - so if there are other options that I am not thinking of, please share!
 Option One: Day trip excursion from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay. Lasts ~12 hours and allows me to book another one day excursion from Hanoi for the second day. I feel like this will result in roughly 6 hours total of travel back and forth for each day, so seems like I am not getting the most out of my days. But, may allow me to see something else I haven&#x27;t considered for a day trip.
 Option Two: Depart early AM via train or bus to Cat Ba Island, arriving midday. This allows some brief exploration of Cat Ba National Park. However, the following day it is unclear to be me if I can actually see Lan Hay Bay. I will be leaving out of Hanoi at 2300hrs that night, so need to be back to the airport around 2000hrs. It looks like my options to get back to mainland are to ferry at 1530hrs (ending my day prematurely) or at 1730hrs (getting back too late). Would it even be possible for me to see Lan Ha Bay in this time? The only thing I&#x27;ve found only is departing from 0800 and not arriving back to the island until 1500, which means my only option would be to take the ferry back at 1730. I&#x27;d like to make this option work, if I can, to see the mostt of the island but looks like the timing doesn&#x27;t quite work :(
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Thinking of visiting in August/September and keeping my trip focused on Hoi An and Huy. I’m looking for long walks and beautiful scenery, good food, great cafes I can read in for hours and people watch. No budget. As an aside, watched The Scent of Green Papaya years ago and thought the scenery was gorgeous, looking for that kind of ambience. Thoughts? Recommendations? Naysayers? All appreciated, thanks!
 Edit: no, not switching my trip to Boulogne. Ignore the movie set dreams.

                              <span>Hey fellow travelers! I recently arrived in North Vietnam and I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for off-beat places to explore. While Hanoi was amazing, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of the city and immerse myself in the beautiful nature of this country.
 But my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I arrived at Ha Long Bay. The pictures I saw online were nothing like the reality I experienced. It was crowded with tourists and heavily commercialized. I needed to find a hidden gem!
 That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m turning to you, fellow travelers, for help. Do you know of any hidden spots in North Vietnam that are off the beaten path? Maybe a secret waterfall, a secluded beach, or a quaint village with friendly locals?
 I&#x27;m on the hunt for something unique and authentic. Something that&#x27;s not overrun with tourists and where I can truly experience the beauty of Vietnam. So, if you have any recommendations, please share them in the comments below!
 Let&#x27;s help each other escape the tourist trap and discover the hidden treasures of North Vietnam.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I wanted to kindly ask for any advice and recommendations regarding possible job opportunities in the tourism/hotel sector of Da Nang/Hoi An. I am 32 years old, originally from Germany. I have BA degree in Southeast Asian and American Studies. I am considering to do a second degree in Tourism/Hotel-Management at an online university in order to be able to work while studying. 
 My overall CV has a lot of &quot;holes&quot; in it, because in my 20s I spent quit a fair amount of time traveling around the globe. I worked seven years as a freelance journalists with a main emphasis on tourism; had countless jobs in restaurants; worked for a company specialized in book trade; and, more recently, been employed as a social worker at a school in Germany. I also have my own little side hustle going on, selling records/cds/cassettes. In addition, I speak Indonesian and Malay, and I am currently trying to advance my Vietnamese language skills. 
 In the near and distant future, I&#x27;d like to live and work in Da Nang. I spent a fair amount of time in the city in the recent decade, and I feel very much at home there. My girlfriend lives in Da Nang, too, and we are in committed long term relationship. Therefore, I am considering to find a suitable occupation for myself in the city, and I can picture myself doing a good job in the tourism sector. Online, though, I can barely find any job ads. 
 I&#x27;d be very grateful if anyone could give me some honest feedback if I&#x27;d be able to get a work permit in the tourism sector in Da Nang with my background; and if so, I&#x27;d appreciate any tips on what to keep in mind, what to be careful about, and so forth. 
 Thank you so much in advance! &#x3D;)

                              <span>Apparently I&#x27;m providing technical support as a volunteer for a ceremony in my University (NEU Career Week) and i&#x27;m tasked with making Powerpoint slides, lighting, etc.There will be parts where music is needed such as giving prizes, awards, introduction of sponsors (yes, money is involved).
 I was going to use video game themes for them, some are actually from Nintendo. But upon reading about copyrights, i thought it&#x27;d be much safer top use something different.
 My question is if I use a popular song in the ceremony, will there be accusations of copyright infringement? I&#x27;d like apologize if I asked something dumb, but I&#x27;m a 2nd year student, still got a lot to learn, and this is my first time doing such important thing.

                              <span>👋 Hi Please don&#x27;t laugh at me but my partner sent me 2 packs of Viet pancake mix and a bottle of fish sauce. I&#x27;m so rubbish at cooking but trying to learn and I&#x27;m not doing to bad. I just need a simple recipe for the pancakes. I have bacon and shrimp and spring onions for the pancakes.
 The fish sauce dip I have nooooo clue what it&#x27;s supposed to taste like. I&#x27;ve never tasted fish sauce before. I have lemon 🍋 sugar and the fish sauce. I don&#x27;t have any chili flakes as I&#x27;m making it for my 8 year old daughter too (also I&#x27;m a stereotypical English WF who can&#x27;t handle too much heat! Wahhh ) So any simple step by step for the dip please 🙏 My partner is coming over to visit and I want to impress him.

                              <span>I will be visiting VietNam very soon on vacation. My husband and I have a few tour guides and drivers that are helping us on our tour of the country. We are obviously planning to tip generously for their service but we thought an additional small gift from the US might be a nice touch. Obviously nothing too elaborate but a nice token as a friendly cultural exchange. I&#x27;m looking for ideas of something easy to pack. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I just wanted to share an interesting story of what happened to us at Gibbon trek. We have tracked down family of four female, male and two babies all foraging and playing. They seem to have a lot of fun amongst each other, especially the babies. About 30 minutes of watching them they have decided to leave the tree and go further. Male Gibbon went directly above us and let it rip, the poop showered us, my camera, clothes, and my girlfriends clothes. Anyone got similar experience with Gibbons? Our guide told us this never happened on his treks, so I&#x27;m just wondering. Amazing experience anyway, would get pooped on by a wild Gibbon any day. 10/10.

                              <span>Just looking at something like a passport power index doesn’t answer this question because almost every European country requires a visa for Vietnamese tourists. 
 But there is a big difference in how hard it is to get a Schengen visa vs. say a Moldovan visa.
 What are some of the easiest European visas for Vietnamese to get?

It seems that the rapid urbanization and economic growth in recent years have led to a boom in real estate development, but sadly, this has come with a slew of negative consequences.

                              <span>So, my parents are from rural Vietnam but ethnically, we are Chinese and I thought it would be cool to go through family birth records and trace up the generations to figure out when we migrated to Vietnam. How would one go about this? Is it possible that records may have gotten lost over many generations into the past? Also, please let me know if someone knows of a better subreddit to ask this on.

                              <span>Hello,
 Sorry if this seems off-topic but my friend has reached top 10 in the vietnamese league server as well as Challenger in both EUW and NA. I think she has a shot at Saigon Buffalo or another pro vietnamese team but besides emailing them what are some ways she could get her foot in the door?
 I&#x27;d ask in the leagueoflegends website but most of them are North American players so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be any vietnamese players. I also think its much harder to break in the vietnamese pro circuit than it is in other regions.
 Any advice appreciated. I can provide her accounts if need be.

                              <span>I have seen foreigners quite aggressively pushing cosmetic products in big malls such as Aeon Tân Bình and Vincom (D2) 
 They sweettalk and use different tropes to push their goods. There is a part of conversation between my wife and one of the sellers in Vincom plaza
 Seller (foreigner): You know today is my bday, so if you buy cream name I will give you another cream for free.
 Shop assistant (VNese) Oh, wow, boss, really? That’s such a good deal!
 They were pretty polite and nice at the start, but completely lost us at this birthday script. The VNese shop assistant’s reaction was so fake, it’s funny.
 Have you personally met such people and what do you know about it?

                              <span>Hi everyone, we unfortunately were not allowed on our flight from Thailand to Vietnam due to a damaged passport. We do have a flight out of a Hanoi to Tokyo planned in about 6 days.
 Since we were unable to travel on our flight to Vietnam, we are opting to get an emergency passport as the US consulate in Thailand.
 After receiving an emergency passport, would we have any issues trying to fly to Hanoi so we can transfer and get to Tokyo on our flight?

                              <span>Yes, I get it, Donnie Yen publicly support the 9 dash line, I dont like that too … but for real, would banning it do any justice at all when the Vietnamese government themselves, indirectly, publicly, proudly and casually “fund” China’s ambition in the South China sea with hundreds of billions of dollars of economic projects every damn year? Lmao? Not to mention all the Chinese movies and shows that were sponsored and sanctioned by the State and their money, are all over the Vietnamese TVs. 
 Those that know will boycott the movie, the average people dont know shit and will watch it. And watching it doesnt mean you support Donnie Yen’s view … and since the economy is going through a recession, the movie industry is dwindling, the International Court of Arbitration denied the 9 dash line’s legitimacy… why not show it, scrapping some billions VND while at it. 
 Sorry for the rant.

 Does anyone know the rough cost of a Rabies Shot?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be in HCMC from 26 to 29th of this month, and as a solo traveler it would be nice to grab a drink or 2 and meet new people - are pub crawls a thing in HCMC? Otherwise, can anyone recommend good spots for a solo traveler to grab a drink? I&#x27;m not particularly interested in the Bui Vien St kind of nightlife, but rather, good quality bars or pubs with a nice and social atmosphere.
 Thanks!

 what is the better way to get around Sapa, hire a local taxi for daily rates or ask the limousine company if they provide private car service while I am there. 
 any input is greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

But a day later, on all online shopping applications, that stuffs appear continuously. Also, on all social media applications, topic relates to it also pop up.

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I&#x27;m considering a study exchange in Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City. The exchange would last about 6 months. I estimate I would need roughly 6 packets of Medikinet (active substance is Methylphenidate). Is that too much too risk for? Is it generally legal to bring that stuff in - in such amounts - every packet has 30 tablets (25mg per each tablet)? What procedures would and should I go through? And finally, what kind of documents - and how prepared - should I bring with me?
 Thx for the answers. 
 PS: I don&#x27;t think I wanna risk with a bribe haha

                              <span>Good day. In the middle of a 6mo trip and as planned we are flying to Hanoi on Friday. We thought my spouse had a muscular injury from weightlifting at a hotel gym 10 days ago. Long story short- he needs a cervical MRI for progressive triceps weakness. Where can we go that would order an MRI that we could get in a timely fashion. I work in medicine and we have and we have exhausted pharmacy options. I know he needs an MRI, so I am specifically looking for a clinic/facility where he could be evaluated and get referred for a n MRI. Thank you.

Im finally going back after many years but Im worried I might not be immune to some things or my vaccinations are not up to date. Is there any shots I should absolutely get before visiting?

                              <span>Hello I am half black man in early 20s and have a trip planned to visit in a few months , I am truly in love the landscape and culture , i I don’t speak the language but plan to really make a effort. I’m curious if it would be hard for me to go on dates at coffee shops and things like that with women around my age are Vietnamese scared of black people ? There is a big mix of opinions on how Vietnamese women feel towards black men , I’d like a honest answer , and best suited city for me to go to ? Thanks 🙏🏼( edit) I never have expected so much different perspectives and insight , thank you to everyone for there input and to the people who continue to give me insight , I’m excited to go on my journey and I promise to treat the country and people with the up most respect ! Cảm ơn lòng biết ơn

                              <span>Hello! The title kinda speaks for itself. I&#x27;m in Vietnam at the moment and whilst here I was hoping to find some factory seconds from brands that I would normally find back home in Australia. Specifically, Vivobarefoot (a barefoot shoe brand), Patagonia, Arcteryx, North Face, etc. I&#x27;m in the north near Hanoi but I&#x27;m happy to travel!
 Any information or sharing of contacts would be appreciated. I&#x27;m not looking to resell, and I&#x27;m mostly needing the gear for trekking. The shoe brand for instance, they are one of the only brands that manafactures in my size (US15), so if I could stock up whilst here that would be helpful. Thanks all.

Parents have been using someone at a local Vietnamese market for awhile and they&#x27;d be saving fees if I just did it. What I&#x27;m confused now about is how to enter the address.
 I have the address from my parents and this is what is on each line. I guess this is how my parents have always addressed it when they send something, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s properly formatted. Their family lives in a rural area. Thank you!

I&#x27;m going to make an effort to buy good gifts, and they are not cheap. My question is: is the first meeting more important or more special than the next ones? I mean, if I give them better gifts on the first meeting than on the second meeting, will it be strange? Or will they expect the gifts to become better and better? I&#x27;m very confused. Could someone help? Thank you!

                              <span>When visiting my girlfriend&#x27;s family for the first time, should I give them gifts according to their &quot;hierarchy&quot;? I mean better gifts for grandma and grandpa, then mom and dad, then sister and brother and so?
 I am afraid about giving a better (and more expensive) gift for grandpa than dad and it becomes an unpleasant situation. What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Viet Kieu spent the pass week here in Hanoi, Sapa and Ninh Binh. Is it just me or the locals are rude and loud. Not the ones working and providing service to you, but the actually locals that goes to the same sites you’re sight seeing. I think they are local because of their dialect. In Sapa, went to Fansipan. Omg they were pushing in line sandwiching everyone, talking and screaming so loud. The men would smoke when there is a no smoking sign. For Buddhas sake you’re at a temple. 
 Then at Tac coc at Bai Dinh temple, signs are everywhere to be silent or quiet as possible. But these ladies are yelling screaming from a distance. Like can’t you read or have some respect?
 Ok done ranting. Maybe it’s the norm for them. But kinda rub me the wrong way.

Lúc mình chen vào giữa 2 chiếc ô tô (1 đen, 1 trắng)thì khoảng trống giữa 2 xe nhỏ lại do chiếc xe trắng chạy áp sát vào. Mình thấy vậy nên rồ ga vượt qua và tông cong kính chiếu hậu xe trắng. Do hoảng và xe đông nên mình không biết dừng xe ở đâu để giải quyết rồi rồ ga bỏ đi. Mọi người có thể cho mình xin lời khuyên được không ạ? ( Em rất xin lỗi vì việc lái xe ẩu và cách giải quyết vấn đề không đúng mực của em nếu chủ xe có nhìn thấy post này). Xin lỗi mọi người vì hành vi thiếu văn hoá khi tham gia giao thông của mình.

                              <span>My first week here, I pet my (then) fiancee&#x27;s family&#x27;s pet dog. The mutt bit me on the finger and I had to go for 5 rabies shots.
 It was a harrowing welcome to Vietnam, let&#x27;s just say that!
 I&#x27;ve been chased by a couple aggressive dogs since that, and seen some wild looking dogs just roaming the streets that I don&#x27;t want anything to do with. 
 I refuse to pet or put myself in any sort of vulnerable position even with friendly dogs. 
 I grew up with pet dogs in the west. To say I&#x27;m a dog lover is an understatement. I miss my family&#x27;s dog so much while I&#x27;m here. 
 I never would have thought that I would develop a fear of dogs, but I feel it growing every time I have to walk past an unknown dog on the street. 
 Rabies scares me more than the dogs to be honest... 
 Luckily the family dog didn&#x27;t have rabies and is still alive. But 5 shots is really annoying to schedule around. Pretty cool they are only $2 though.

                              <span>Went to get a massage here in Hanoi. Massage was 300k and after the massage I assumed 50k would be enough for a tip. But the masseuse refused and so I pulled out a 100k note and she took it and then pointed at the 50k to give to her as well. I don&#x27;t speak any vietnamese so I just gave it to her as well. Was I ripped off? 50% tip is a little too much imo 😅 I just considered it foreigner tax and won&#x27;t be going back to that place lol
 Edit: This thread has been polarizing. And for the record it was just a normal 90 minute massage. No extras. And if I&#x27;m being honest the massage was not good either. The lady was inconsistent on where to apply pressure and did not do so equally on both sides and just massaged wherever. The place was nice and situated in a somewhat affluent neighborhood so I expected something better.

                              <span>We are very much looking forward to a 8 day trip to Da nang beginning of April. Can anyone please advise what you would budget for spending money, hotel and flights all paid for. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 young children. Any information and tips for places to go would be fab 😁

                              <span>Hi everyone! I just bought a set of cards that I had seen a group of Vietnamese women play a few days ago, and wanted to learn the rules but I can’t find anything convincing on internet (the rules found in Wikipedia don’t make much sense). Anyone has a link to the rules of Tam cúc (which is, I think, the game they were playing, as they had these thin Chinese cards)?
 Thanks a bunch! Will keep on looking online in case I find anything.
 Extra question: anyone knows where to import to Europe the cool plastic or wooden stools found at the street food stalls/bars?
 Edit: If someone knows the rules, could I send a DM with my doubts on the rules found online?

                              <span>I ask because I&#x27;ve seen quite a few articles about how extremely easily-offended many Vietnamese immigrant communities, especially in Seattle and throughout California and Texas, are when they see the modern flag, equating it with the Confederate and Nazi flags, and have forced many institutions to use the traditional yellow one instead.
 I kinda wonder if it&#x27;s as serious as local news outlets say it is or if it&#x27;s all gross exaggerations that inadvertently make the Vietnamese community look bad. Because taken to the logical extreme, it would mean Hardee&#x27;s/Carl&#x27;s Jr and Steven Universe would be protested against or banned.

 I&#x27;m trying to get a friend I know into modeling work in Vietnam but as a foreigner I know very little about the industry there. May I know a list of some well paying agencies in Vietnam so she could shoot her shot? Google isn&#x27;t helping very much here haha thanks.

                              <span>So basically, renting a bike and riding from HCMC to Hanoi later this year.
 Planning to rent either a Honda Blade or Honda XR150. The dates I will be travelling are from 24th Oct to the the 4th of November. 
 So I have currently planned 10 days of riding.
 Day 1: HCMC to Cat Tien Day 2: Cat Tien to Dalat Day 3: Dalat to Phan Thiet Day 4: Phan Thiet to Nha Trang Day 5: Nha Trang to Mang den Day 6: Mang Den to Hoi an Day 7: Hoi an to Hue Day 8: Hue to Phong Nha Day 9: Phong Nha to Mai chau Day 10: Mai Chau to Hanoi
 Now here is my dilemma. I am very time restricted and only have 12 full days to complete this ride. Is it possible to do this? Am I an idiot for even considering this? Will I make it in time considering weather etc? I am a very experienced rider, so riding in the rain does not bother me, but will floods and such stop me? Any recommendations or considerations would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, I hope you&#x27;re all doing well. 
 I am used to solo traveling, and sometimes I schedule solo trips for my birthday to celebrate it on a different way. Every time I did this I had an amazing time with the people I met randomly during the trips! 
 This year I&#x27;ve chosen to do this in Vietnam and I was thinking on spending this day on a 2-days cruise to Ha Long Bay. My other options are Hanoi itself or maybe Da Nang. I am, however, scared that these cruises are full of closed groups or families and I end up having a not-so-pleasant experience. 
 For those who did this already, what do you think? Is there any other alternative you strongly suggest? Side note: turning 33. 
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Tôi 24t. Đang đứng trước cơ hội học đại học ở nước ngoài. Nhìn bạn bè đã đi làm ổn định, xem lại mình thấy nản quá. Cũng vì ko lo học hành tử tế nên phải đi đường vòng. Xin tí động lực để tiếp tục đi các bro. Cũng khuyên các bạn nên học hành đàng hoàng để ko phải phí thời gian như tôi nhé 😢

                              <span>The highlight from my trip was the warm reception from almost everybody we met.
 The lowlight was the challenge to find good vegetarian food easily. Maybe it was first trip and so we were struggling to find the non-meat options but we did found some options online which I kind of became our thing for the rest of the trip.

                              <span>Someone recommended I bus from the Airport to D1. I ended up using grab which cost about 50k vnd, ~$2. Same as busfare but way faster and more convenient. Other than having to walk out of the airport perimeter before calling the grab.
 This made me wonder why buses should be used at all. Maybe just personal preference to be in bigger, safer vehicles? Why do you guys use them?

                              <span>Hey y’all! I’m currently visiting Vietnam from the US with my friend. I’m going to have some free time and l would like to try to meet some people and hang out. I don’t speak the language so that’s been tough so I know it’s a bit of a long shot lol. I am traveling with my friend who speaks the language but I’ll be having some down time to go out and explore a bit. I’ll be in Nha Trang, Da Nang, and Saigon. I enjoy live music, sight-seeing, coffee, bars, of course food! Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do and how i can meet locals? Or even other travelers? I’m not a super extroverted person so this is uncharted territories for me.

Mà quảng cáo phải theo sở thích người dùng chứ, trc giờ tôi có cá cược bao giờ đâu mà hiện lắm thế. Kết thúc là tôi đã xóa fb ra khỏi máy mình 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

                              <span>I&#x27;m visiting Vietnam in April but having huge issues booking hotels via booking.com. Both of the hotels I have booked so far want me to either transfer them via Square/Paypal or give them my card details over Whatsapp.
 Does this seem like a scam? 
 They already have my card details, so I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t charge me the deposit immediately.

                              <span>We&#x27;re in Hanoi currently and didn&#x27;t plan ahead, so that&#x27;s on us. Ha long bay is something we&#x27;re planning to do, but the itineraries seem the same between companies and we came up with the idea of maybe just going to Ha Long and spending the night there to book a day cruise from town. 
 Is this a good or bad idea? We&#x27;re trying to budget and a lot the 2 day tours are higher than what we&#x27;re hoping for.

                              <span>I’m going to Vietnam for 2 weeks in May, I’m just looking for some ideas on how to fill my time being there. 
 My basic itinerary is the following
 Flying into Hanoi and going straight to Halong bay for 3 days Going back to Hanoi for 3 days Flying to Ho Chi Minh for 3 days Flying to Da Nang for 3 days 
 I’m going with my partner but she’s there for work for the first few days in Halong and we’re meeting in Hanoi 3 days later. 
 Just looking for some ideas on the solo 3 days in Halong for a somewhat adventurous guy, I plan on doing a day cruise and a Hike but don’t know how to fill the other couple days there. 
 I enjoy architecture and scenery I plan to enjoy in Hanoi, but any must sees would be amazing to hear. 
 The Ho Chi Minh trip I plan on doing the walking street and unsure how to fill the other days. 
 Da Nang I plan on doing the hands bridge and enjoying the beach I think doing the marble mountain as well and doing a trip to Hà Nội as well. 
 Any input, on how to fill the days is greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Just curious if anyone has recently had luck changing their vietjet booking? The website completely stops working when I try and confirm and see the price difference.
 Any recommendations? Should I call them? I have a flexible ticket!
 Thanks

                              <span>My friend (20) has lived in Latvia (Europe) for around 5 years now. He went to highschool here, speaks the language, goes to university and soon will be eligible for a citizenship here. To get it, he needs to renounce the Vietnamese citizenship but he told me that it can be a very long and difficult process. Does anyone have experience with it? Is it really that difficult?
 Another thing - he has not done the military training and is not planning to as he wants to spend his life in Latvia. But he has to go to Vietnam this summer to renew his ID. I&#x27;m worried he might get into trouble for avoiding the training so I&#x27;m quite worried about him going there. Can anyone give me some insight on this?

Of the people you know, what percentage wants to be a virgin until marriage? What is the role of religion in all of it? Do you think it is different than in the West?

Every single one of them, it reeks of a tourist trap. Does anyone here have experience with the area, are there any tours without these worthless tourist attractions? Have you negotiated with the boat drivers to take you somewhere else?

                              <span>Hey Everybody, I will spend 2 weeks in Vietnam (I live in Europe) and I already love that wonderful country.
 Of course 2 weeks are not enough to see all those beautiful spots/things, but I have a very detailed itinerary I prepared myself and I already know I will want to come back 😍
 The advice I would love to receive from you is what can I buy there that is way cheaper than in Europe. I am only thinking to buy stuff for myself, but it is not that clear to me if there are really all these opportunities like it seems reading online. 
 Appreciate any tips
 Thanks folks 😃🖐🏼

                              <span>I think, Vietnam could do several things to attract more foreign tourists, such as:
 Relaxing its visa policy and extending visa-free stay for eligible countries.
 Developing new products and services that cater to the diverse needs and preferences of travelers.
 Promoting its natural beauty, cultural heritage and gastronomy as unique selling points.
 Leveraging its strong economic ties with neighboring countries and potential markets.
 What is your thought?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some advice from vietnamese families/women or anyone who has done this before in a vietnamese context. 
 I&#x27;m the only expat in my community and I&#x27;d really love to start a mom&#x27;s group to get to know the others in the community better. I know the concept is probably not normal for Vietnam but would anyone have any suggestions on what sort of things would be a &quot;draw&quot; for a mom&#x27;s group? I know how the groups are in my home country but my husband says if I just say &quot;a time to share together, talk together, and learn from each other&quot; no one will come (I kind of agree). I also don&#x27;t want it to seem like a kid drop-off time if I say we will do things like have storytime and snacks. 
 What in your opinion would be some activities that would make a monthly group/meet-up for vietnamese moms exciting and worthwhile? 
 (For context, the group will be in vietnamese, and not in a large city setting) 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone! Does snake means something in vietnamese culture? 
 I am buying some gifts for my girlfriend&#x27;s family and one of the gifts (alcohol) has a snake symbol in it. I bought it but then I kept wondering if that may have some bad meaning in vietnam. If that&#x27;s the case, I will not give this gift. 
 Anyone? Thank you!

                              <span>Vlogs and reels deem Vietnam unsafe for travel.. crossing the street is a matter of life and death, people getting mugged here and there.. 
 People and long-time residents of Vietnam, I need to know your opinion! 
 I know these stuff should be take as a grain of salt, but what’s the real tea? 
 Tips and suggestions are also welcome! We will be traveling next week and will be staying around District 4 HCM, I’m ecstatic at the same time scared because of this awful reels.

                              <span>Hi! 
 Are there any shops in Hanoi selling old (used) comics, books and magazines?
 When i&#x27;m abroad i&#x27;m always looking for comic books in the native language, especially Donald Duck (Donald và bạn hữ) but also the franco-belgian stuff like Tintin, Lucky Luke and Asterix. It seems all this series were published in Vietnam at least two decades ago but not any longer. I guess Mangas are the big thing now.
 A couple of years ago (2017?) in HCMC i stumbled across a street (can&#x27;t remember which district) with shop on shop where old magazines were pieled up in front. I found a lot of stuff but it was just the first week of our trip and my wife would&#x27;ve killed me if we had to carry a ton of comics for a month...
 Are there any of these shops in Hanoi. I&#x27;ve been to Đinh Lễ Street and Nhà sách Mão already (these pop up when you google). But all i got was one new Tintin at Trang Tien bookstore. A lot of shops i found on Google Maps which seemed very promissing are actually closed (Covid i guess).
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am travelling through Vietnam (in SE Asia 10 months right now) and some days ago I visited Ninh Binh area. I was so surprised how money demanding people are here. First time in my trip I saw people who punch tourits as they Gave too low tip... (Tam Coc lake). People here and also in Hanoi (sorry guys, thats my impression) are so impolite... I spent earlier 2 months in the south and in the central part and now I am so dissapointed.. white person means only money... more money... I am aware of that but even when I Got sick owner of our guesthouse wanted me to rent a bike and he was angry when I said &quot;Im sick, I stay in bed&quot; . I dont want to have so bad memories from this part of Vietnam - any tips where should I go instead typical tourist trail? I loved south and central one, north until now made a mess in my tourist head 😜

 I’ve been working remotely since covid and I’m much more productive that way.
 I’m just wondering if there are remote/part remote jobs out there in Vietnam and what kind of businesses would have that? I work in finance

                              <span>Dear Redditors,
 We&#x27;re visiting Vietnam for the first time, and after seeing HCMC, Hanoi, Ha Long, and Da Nang/Hoi An we&#x27;re considering for location to work one week remotely before heading home - thus, where would you stay and why (at end of April)?
 My initial consideration is:
 a) to avoid HCMC and Hanoi and due to hecticness
 b) to avoid Nha Trang due to the potentially high amount of russian tourists/ex-pats
 c) to highly consider staying in Da Nang/Hoi An and renting a villa
 Thank you in advance for your opinions! Much appreciated!

                              <span>Not sure if this the right subreddit to consult. I am Eastern Orthodox Christian, but growing up my father and his side of the family were Catholic. I live near a Vietnamese Catholic church and I was always curious to observe a Catholic mass. Would I be judged for visiting a Vietnamese Catholic church on a random Sunday? As a Vietnamese person I notice that older Vietnamese individuals can be judgemental/gossip and as someone who usually wears head coverings to church out of respect and religious focus, I don&#x27;t want to stick out too much.

                              <span>Whenever I play any online games (especially Roblox, kid game, you know). I always see a group of Vietnamese plays together and trash-talking other players in their language. Their English is too bad that they even think the word trash-talking is swearing, and I were calling they are trash - I have no word. Kept trash talking about me because of the language barrier, I understand 100% what they said. However, they didn&#x27;t listen and always thought that I did something wrong to them, then spread the misunderstanding to their friends... Became really toxic, killed me in spawn because they have a gang,...
 If you are the member in that gang, please. Stop making the image of a friendly country turning into a toxic place where every one of my friends always warn me to stay away from them online (even Vietnamese friends advised me it)
 I also wonder if it is the majority of your community is like that, or I&#x27;m just unlucky?

                              <span>So apparently, Vietnam has signed an agreement to recognize driver&#x27;s licenses from other ASEAN countries. I&#x27;ve read from a a few sources that Vietnam does indeed recognize them in certain situations (but not others?). The sources don&#x27;t bother mentioning in which specific situations they&#x27;re recognized though. I&#x27;m planning to do the Ha Giang loop next week and heard they&#x27;re checking for checking for licenses quite frequently nowadays. Has anyone showed their Filipino, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian or Singaporean license to the cops and gotten away with it? (Or any other ASEAN country, just got lazy to list them all)

 Stefan Kubiak was a soldier who served in french foreign legion. He was sended to Vietnam to help keep french colonial rule. After he had seen french war crimes he defected to Việt Minh. He fought in battle of Dien Bien Phu. Due to recurring wounds and severe malaria, he fell seriously ill in 1963 and died in Hanoi.

                              <span>Just seeking out information regarding vietnamese language courses in Saigon. I&#x27;ll try to be succinct: I&#x27;ve looked online and on the forums but detailed info is scarce.
  
Are there comprehensive and or accredited language courses for English speakers?
 Are there long term courses with an aim to become at least high conversational or &quot;fluent&quot; in the sense of being able to clearly communicate at a decently high level?
 Are there any long term programs that facilitate long-term visas ( Education Visa/Student Visa) that are not higher learning degrees (bachelor&#x27;s ECT)?
 What are the approximate prices and costs for such programs? 
  
I&#x27;ve started doing preliminary information gathering and early stage planning for a possible timeframe of returning to HCMC between September to December of this…</span>

                              <span>Anyone has any recommendations? Ideally its combined skin care consultation with treatment services at a reasonable price. So far I have been going to Grace Skincare clinic in D1 which is pricey but good and high in demand. However, they do for example no fillers.

They keep the water cool and they&#x27;re prettier than keeping those ugly plastic jugs on the kitchen counter. Can&#x27;t find any shops or online stores that sell them though. Any ideas?

Yesterday, two friends of mine, and my own SIM card seemed to suddenly cut out and the data isn’t working and hasn’t worked today either. I don’t think I’ve managed to use 120gb, anyone have any idea? Any help is massively appreciated.

                              <span>Speaking as someone who loves baseball, I find it really cool that Vietnamese people are rocking my team’s brand (San Francisco Giants). Ofc it’s not as popular as the Yankees, Red Sox and D*dgers but I understand that MLB is more of a fashion brand and I’m sure most people who wear the brand probably don’t care about baseball at all but it just hits close to home seeing people rocking with it. Would be even better to get more people interested in the game.

                              <span>My wife is from Vietnam but has been living in the US for 8 years. Her parents have been living here longer, and no longer have any Vietnamese citizenship papers. The question concerns them.
 Due to circumstances they put their properties in the name of a relative who still lives in Vietnam, but now they wish to change that. Because they no longer have their citizenship papers, and it takes a long time to get them again, they cannot put the properties in their names. What sort of options do they have?
 I was wondering if there was a kind of trust they could use to own the property, but have the trust be controlled by them, or, at the very least, have it be controlled by a relative still in Vietnam, but with their name attached in some way that requires their consent for anything to be done to the property. They are old and probably too trusting, I want to see if there is any way we can help protect their interests as well as possible. They said they already spoke to an attorney, but I am not sure they spoke to the right kind or asked the right questions.
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Mostly curious about Hu Tieu and Bun Mam street food carts. The places that have reusable bowls, not the take out containers.
 I assume every customer just shares the same bowl and chopsticks if the owner cannot wash dishes.

                              <span>I am finally meeting my fiancé in June! I
 want to get married and get him here as soon as possible since I am already 25. I was looking into getting married right away and applying for the cr1 visa but I heard it takes such a long time and I&#x27;m looking to settle down and start a family soon.
 Should I meet him and then apply for the k1 visa??? I wonder if they would even let me apply since I barely meet him for the first time. I am just so confused about what I should do. I know I need to provide so many documents and proof. I&#x27;m in southern California if anyone knows any companies for assistance :(

                              <span>Hi everybody, I&#x27;m planning a trip to Vietnam very soon and I&#x27;d like to stay around 40 days straight then leave the country for 2 or 3 weeks and come back for another 3 weeks. I hold a French passport. Is this doable?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Xin chào mọi người. Mình hiện tại thì vừa tốt nghiệp đại học ngành kế toán và đang làm trong b4. Mình đang ở canada theo diện work permit nên sẽ có 3 năm để làm việc và cũng như cơ hội để kiếm thẻ xanh ở đây. Nhưng mà hiện tại thì em cảm thấy rất muốn về VN để sinh sống và làm việc cũng như được ở gần gia đình và bạn bè hơn. Nên mình dự tính là vẫn sẽ ở canada làm việc 2-3 năm để có thêm kinh nghiệm (và bằng CPA ). Mình chỉ đang thắc mắc là nếu trường hợp mình như vậy thì về vn có ổn không ạ? Và vấn đề lương thì mọi người thấy như thế nào? Mình thật sự rất cần lời khuyên ngay lúc này vì mình cảm thấy rất nhớ Việt Nam. Nếu quyết định về VN thì mình nghĩ lương sẽ không thể nào bằng được như ở CA được, nhưng mình nghĩ mình sẽ thoải mái hơn vì được gần gia đình và bạn bè và cũng như được ăn những món mình thích hoặc buồn thì cứ xách xe lên mà đi 1 vòng thôi. Nhưng nếu lương không ổn thì cũng hơi stress 1 tí. 
 Cho mình cảm ơn mọi người nhiều.
 Hi everyone. I have just graduated from the university majoring in accounting and currently working as an accountant in Big4. I am in Canada on a work permit so I will have 3 years to work as well as the opportunity to apply for a green card. But now, I really feel like going back to Vietnam to live and work so I can be closer to my family and friends. I’m planning to stay in Canada to work for 2-3 years to gain more experience (and getting CPA). Is ok to go back to Vietnam after that? And what about the salary expectation? I really need some advices right now because I miss Vietnam so much. If I do decide to return to Vietnam, I don&#x27;t think the salary will be as good as compared to CA, but I think I will be happier since I can be closer family and friends .
 Thank you and I really appreciate any advices/ suggestions/ inputs.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m currently in Southeast Asia and will be arriving in Vietnam in late April. I originally planned to do the motorbike loop in Ha Giang independently on rented bikes, but that was before I learned about needing a motorcycle license. I don&#x27;t want to risk my insurance being void, so that&#x27;s out of the question now. 
 I was pretty set on doing it independently without a company, so this threw a real wrench in my plan. I&#x27;ve already decided to skip travelling to Northern Thailand because of burning season, so I know I&#x27;ll be back to the area, so my question is whether I should wait until I have a motorcycle license and do it later in life, or just suck it up and do it with an easy rider. 
 The reason I&#x27;m posting is just to hear how it went for other people. I don&#x27;t love not being in control of my own bike, I&#x27;m somewhat introverted so the social aspect isn&#x27;t huge, I like being able to stop and check out little shops or side roads, and I&#x27;m concerned with a bigger group that I won&#x27;t be able to do this. I don&#x27;t really have the money to do a private tour, and even doing it with an easy rider is putting a bit of a stretch on my budget. 
 Overall though, I&#x27;m wondering if I should still just do it. I suppose I&#x27;m just looking for stories of how people felt using easy riders and whether they felt like they would have had a better time doing it solo. The loop was the one thing I wanted to do the most out of Southeast Asia, but I&#x27;m wondering if I should just do it later when I can fully enjoy it. 
 Thanks in advance!

 I&#x27;m hoping to hire an artist who can create some sketches and Vietnamese writings in a journal that will be used as a prop in a short film.
 The project will require writing journal entries (in Vietnamese) for a character and producing sketches that would include medical drawings and sketches of plants, animals, and people. I would want to produce somewhere around 6-8 pages in total.
 Here&#x27;s the sort of look I am hoping for: Example journal
 Please send me a DM and we can talk about the project and your rate in more detail! Thank you!
 (Also, please let me know if I should post this request somewhere else instead.)

                              <span>This maybe is not new but my ma (mom) told me that someone , a woman approach her with pretty much her face covered . She asked ma to get her two cans of energy drinks and gave her a single paper of 500K vnd bill which my ma persume is fake , when she gave back spare changes the woman told her why is this so expensive and some people told her it was cheaper before and demands her money back which my mom denies and asks her to give back first . After a while of arguement the woman gave my mother back the money and my ma have to count the correct ammount and check if the bill is fake or not after that she gives back the woman the bill she gave my ma earlier and then left . Just for awareness but has anyone been i a familiar situation ? I got calls today from somewhat loans sharks which i don&#x27;t know of demanding me money and my mom almost getting scammed

                              <span>Hello! Looking for some advice - let me know if this isn’t the right place. Friend and I are planning to ride 110cc bikes from north to south, weaving from mountains to coast in April/May. 
 We are fully licensed to ride motorcycles in the US and have been riding for years. Fully understand that riding there is different and we take that seriously. Would be wearing protective gear and staying off the roads that don’t allow bikes. The US IDP provided by AAA lists Vietnam as “not party to the 1949 convention but honors IDP”. This is a little confusing as Vietnam did sign the Geneva convention in 1953. So while we aren’t terribly worried about being allowed to do this, we are having trouble finding medical insurance coverage since there doesn’t appear to be any laws that explicitly say US citizens can rent or drive any type or vehicle there. We’ve read about certain companies that would provide medical coverage anyway as long as you are licensed and qualified in your home country but haven’t found one yet.
 Is anyone aware of a way we can do this? Or any companies that expats or travelers have used successfully recently? I’m not willing to ride without medical coverage so I would need to travel by other means or go somewhere else. This is a trip I’ve been thinking of doing for years - I’d be extremely bummed to have to see this beautiful country out a train window and not be able to experience the smaller mountain communities along the journey (I’d also need to do the trip alone in this case). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Spent 9 days traveling in Vietnam. Started from Hoi An and kept moving to Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, and ended at Ho Chi Minh. Used different modes of transport, met tons of people, and experienced things that I&#x27;m truly grateful for.
 My experiences helped me break a lot of stereotypes and prejudices that were told to me before my visit. Vietnam is not a country for cheap shopping or fake stuff or weird food. it&#x27;s not a country where people will con you or misguide you. It&#x27;s not a country that is rude, indifferent, or selfish.
 After 9 days in Vietnam, I&#x27;m taking back memories of meeting kind locals who go out of their way to help you, friendly shopkeepers who give you a small sovenieur as good luck because you made them smile while bargaining, helpful grab drivers who gave you a genuine smile just because you bowed and offered with money with both hands, Bar tenders and staff, who booked grab for me and offered a free drink just because i was nice to them. At every situation I got stuck or lost, I was given direction by locals who didn&#x27;t have to give a fuck about me. After traveling many places in the world, I sincerely believe that if tourists remove their stereotypical blindfolds, they can experience a truly beautiful country I.e. Vietnam. ❤️ And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m taking back to India with me.
 P.S: I would like to offer my hospitality if anyone is planning to travel to India, especially Mumbai. Over and out.

I have an International Driving Permit from USA through AAA, according to some sites I should be able to use my IDP to exchange for a Vietnamese DL. Is that possible or will they require me to have a TRC? This is for driving a car, not a motorbike.

 I am seeking for some tips and suggestions to explore the North part of the country in 2-3 weeks.
 Please share the places which I must cover/visit during this trip. 
 P.S. I love photography and so please suggest places which has potential for me to get some good memorable pictures.

 I&#x27;m planning a trip to Vietnam for a month. During this trip I&#x27;m looking to fly to either hanoi or hcmc, buy a motorbike and travel to the other end of the country.
 I&#x27;m looking for stuff to stop off and do on the way, I&#x27;m an adventures person i like sky diving, scuba diving, para gliding, quad biking, and all that kind lf stuff. 
 I love beaches, exploring, beautiful views, good food and tradition.
 If you guys have visited this beautiful country before and have some suggestions it would be Highley appreciated 😊

                              <span>Xin Chao everyone! My question is straight forward - are universities good in VietNam? 
 I know that generally STEM is better than Social subjects, however if you guys would apply to a university in VietNam, which one would you consider? I would like to study Law or Business and I already know some basic Vietnamese as i had experience with the language before and studying it for university wouldn&#x27;t be a problem! 
 Please help me as I am considering VietNam as one of my destionations for pursuing a higher education, Xin Cam On! ;)

                              <span>I&#x27;m set to leave for Vietnam next week. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve just now found out that the internet speeds are supposedly garbage in Vietnam at the moment. How bad is it? Would a VPN help get around any throttling? Are phone network speeds similarly affected? I&#x27;m actually set to be taking online classes, so this is quite concerning for me.

 I just watched an amazing Korean drama on YouTube called Tranh Đoạt Thừa Kế (&quot;Graceful Family&quot; in English) with great Vietnamese dubbing. Does anyone have recommendations on other good shows with good Vietnamese dubbing?

 Where do you buy contact lenses and contact fluid? I&#x27;m in Bin Thanh at the moment but any place that speaks english will do. I don&#x27;t need a check up, just the lenses. I head out tomorrow and hoping to pick up lenses quickly. Looking for a place like Top Charoen Optical in Thailand. Thanks!

 ​
 I&#x27;m looking for a business suit for office use. I&#x27;m tall (1m85) so I will need to have it adjusted because the ready to wear offer in vietnam does not fit well for me (too short)
 ​
 Any suggestion ? For below 3 000 000 VND ?

 Thank You

                              <span>tl;dr: trying to find an old family graveyard. I know it’s hopeless, but maybe someone here has some advice lol
 My grandmother’s grandmother is from Huế, my grandmother’s family is from Tra Vinh, where we went to a family graveyard when we went to Vietnam for the first time this summer. We were able to come there since our family still has contact with Hmong people (?) that used to work for the family who own it now. It had the graves of many family members except one, my grandmother’s grandmother: Nguyễn Thị Điệm (born ca. 1880). Although there was a picture of her with her date of death: 20 Aug 1916. My grandmother told me that she was buried in Huế with her family, and that her brother who now lives in the US visited the grave in 2000 via contact with the gravekeepers, although she has not had contact with him for a long time, and does not seem very keen on doing it either. Apparently her brother (my greatuncle) is also not that bright due to his years in the camp.
 The family was apparently very rich, and were according to my family close to the emperor, I know nothing else except that Nguyễn Thị Điệm’s brother was a very prestigious or conceited photographer.
 I know its probably hopeless, but does anyone maybe have any advice on how i should find (how to contact) the graveyard (owners)? Or any other advice?
 Or just drop your personal family stories in the comments:)

                              <span>Hi, I’m currently in Hanoi and am planning to travel to SaPa in the next couple of days for some trekking. I don’t really want book a trekking tour so I was just wondering if anyone has experience with this. Is it possible to trek to some different villages and book home stays for one night on arrival?
 Any other info is appreciated!

                              <span>I have a few opportunities in Vietnam but is trying to navigate the space here - in terms of relationship building and the softer side of people. 
 How does it work typically? I work for an MNC and while I do not want to go into the zone of corruption, I do want to understand the dynamics between seller/customers. 
 Do people typically go KTVs for some &#x27;fun&#x27; or is it usually in normal dinner places or what not? Are gifts expected?

                              <span>As the title says, it&#x27;s really hard to find someone in Vietnam since most of them have the same name and surname.
 So I&#x27;m actually a half Filipino half Vietnamese(dad filipino, mom vietnamese), when I was 7 years old, my mom was ask to go back to Vietnam since she&#x27;s been overstayed here in the Philippines, and promised to comeback after she fix the issue, and in the first few months we still have a communication with her and then suddenly gone, no calls, letter, etc.
 I am now 24 years old, Ive been searching for her for years, I do not wish her to come back to our lives, I just wanted to know how was she&#x27;s been doing. I tried searching her on facebook but no luck, cuz everytime I searched her full name a lot of the accounts has the same or similar names, I even include my middle name which is &quot;Nguyen&quot; in my facebook so its easier for her to find me.
 And I&#x27;m not even sure if this is right sub to post this, and sorry if my writing is scuffed, and also my english😅😅

                              <span>A long time ago I had a Vietnamese student who would say something anytime he would get a wrong answer or anytime he was frustrated. When I asked him about he said it was like a bad word. 
 It was a single word with a long s at the end.... Like &quot;hasssss&quot; or &quot;hesssss&quot;
 Would really like to know what the word actually was, hopefully he wasn&#x27;t calling me a dickhead! Haha

                              <span>Did a search and Vietnam&#x27;s ministry quotes 100k expats in Vietnam. They did use the word &quot;permanently&quot; though. What do you guys think is the real number?
 For comparison Thailand, with 33% fewer local population, has about 3.5m expats

                              <span>Hi all,
 I will be traveling for 4 months around South East Asia and am looking to buy medical insurance.
 All the providers I&#x27;ve seen (including reputable ones like TrueTraveller or World Nomads) say it on their fine print that they only cover medical treatment in state-run hospitals.
 I am looking for a provider that would foot the bill from a private hospital.
 Does anyone know of any providers?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I plan to travel to Da Nang via Ho Chi Minh City. The plane ticket that I am looking at has 1 hour 50 minutes layover in HCMC Airport. The airport&#x27;s domestic terminal doesn&#x27;t seem so far away from the international terminal. But being a foreigner, I need to go though the customs and immigrations, which I heard could take approximately an hour.
 Would I have enough time to catch the connecting flight to Da Nang or should I get another ticket that has a 3 hour layover?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am Vietnamese girl dating an expat for the 1st time, plz give me some advices. I live in Hanoi, he lives in HCM so this is the first time dating. He asks me to show him around when we meet in Hanoi. I was kinda passive in the relationships with other Vietnamese boyfriends before, like they picked me up to dating locations. Thus, I don’t know how to take the lead in dating with an expat in Hanoi. Which type of transportation used when we date? I don’t have car driving license. Pick him up by a motorbike I drive is bit weird, isn’t it? Have you been in this situation? Plz share your experience. Kindly introduce me some places that expats want to hangout in Hanoi. We are both in twenties. Much appreciated!
 Edit: Thank so much for your advice. Most of them are very helpful. I am way too overthinking. I was worried about the size difference if I drive him on a bike, im like 5’1 feet while he is 6’2 feet. But, I will ask him what he wants to choose bike or cab although bike is the my most preferred transport when hanging out in Hanoi. To whom who may wish me luck with green card: he is not even a Western. He is my Hindu colleague. We hit it off and accept a long distance relationship. That’s it. Now Vietnamese girls don’t date expats for money. We can be both cute and rich at the same time. Get used to it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am visiting Vietnam in July this year for a close friend&#x27;s wedding. Just wondering what Vietnamese people typically give their friends and loved ones as a wedding gift? I&#x27;ve actually never been to any wedding as an adult so I&#x27;m a bit lost and gifting in a completely different culture makes it feel even more daunting. I would love to hear some examples of what you would typically choose as a wedding gift.
 Also - Other foreign friends who are going have said they are just going to give the couple money, is this normal/acceptable in Vietnam? And if so, how much should one typically give?
 Appreciate any insights, cheers

                              <span>Hello! First time in Vietnam and enjoying the sights. Staying in Ho Chi Minh city amd curious if there are any good venues for live music, funk, or whiskey bar style settings. Recommendations welcome! Staying at the Au Lac Charmer hotel. 
 Also - what is the deal with the small bars that have multiple women out front? It’s not red light district, is it more to entice to enter the bars? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Me and girlfriend are currently in Saigon and we are obviously considering visiting the Cu Chi tunnels the day after tomorrow. However I&#x27;m not really sure whether it&#x27;s worth it or not, because of the relatively long drive there. 
 I&#x27;m very interested in the Vietnam war and already know plenty about it, so visiting something like this seem like a natural choice but at the same time I hate things that are too touristy and this seem exactly that. People posing for dumb pictures, like thousands of others before them, standing on destroyed tanks or in entrances to one of the tunnels.
 Would you recommend it?

                              <span>Hi, i am indian and i am just curious to know whether Vietnam has &quot;business/agents&quot; that offers views to Youtubers for money ? 
 Because i came across something on youtube that looks like targetting views/clicks from indians. The contents looks like from Vietnam hence i posted here. Sorry if this is not the right place for this.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am planning on traveling in Northern Vietnam this month. The air quality apps show really high PM 10 and PM 2.5 numbers, meaning the air is hazardous for health.
 I was wondering - is this casual for that side of the country or is it because of the burning season, similarly to Northern Thailand?
 Maybe anyone currently travelling there could share there experiences?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hey Community,
 I&#x27;m in Da Nang for the next 7 weeks and love it so far. But still did not meet any local women, which I obviously wouldn&#x27;t mind. I would like to go out tomorrow night, I don&#x27;t mind going solo. And then, I am usually not afraid to talk with a women if there seems to be an &#x27;&#x27;opening&#x27;&#x27;. I value a good friendship, and nice communication / talk, even if nothings happens afterwards. It&#x27;s really mostly about meeting local people/women and &#x27;&#x27;why not if more&#x27;&#x27;.
 What would be the best nightclubs to easily meet local people who are more likely to be &#x27;&#x27;into foreigners&#x27;&#x27; (I am in my thirties, very healthy and tall, I think I can be doing ok) and more likely to be able to talk a bit or good English ? Avoiding places full of &#x27;&#x27;pro&#x27;s&#x27;&#x27; and full of Koreans could be a good thing I imagine :D (but I imagine it&#x27;s not always avoidable).
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>So there&#x27;s this rap song that I came across, I &#x27;m just curious what it means since apparently it&#x27;s vulgar? Google translate made it kind of a jumbled mess. If I need to add a NSFW tag, please let me know. Here are the lyrics:
 Mình ở đâu đấy?
 Lạc vào trong xứ sở dâu tây
 Phía đằng xa,
 Giữa bãi cỏ hai người nằm ra
 Chú cuội ngủ cùng chị Hằng Nga
 Nick Vujicic dùng đầu đập cửa
 Gọi cô bé cầm nhầm bật lửa
 Bác xuân diệu vô cùng vội vàng
 Gọi cô tấm đi dự hội làng
 Bảy cô lùn đi cùng ông tuyết
 nếu bị lạc liên hệ tổng đài 1900-00-không-biết
 anh thánh gióng miệng nhiều vết bẩn
 ăn bánh quy, kẹo chip chip, sữa chua nếp cẩm
 aladin gạ gẫm mỵ nương bàn kế hoạch hóa
 sơn tinh ném bàn ghế gạch đá
 scooby dooby doo lại phải dắt sơn tinh đi tù
 giơ khẩu súng nặn bằng đất sét
 cả ngôi làng đều chạy mất dép
 scooby dooby doo lại phải dắt sơn tinh đi tù
 thủy tinh mang theo cốc trà chanh
 làng vắng tanh như chùa bà đanh
 ran mori sử dụng tán thủ
 các võ sư không ai dám thử
 nên nàng đưa conan về nhà cả hai phá án ở nhà thám tử
 một giấc mơ suýt thì hoàn chỉnh
 có giọng nói làm mình choàng tỉnh
 xanh, đỏ, tím, vàng 
 any help is appreciated, sorry for possibly sounding stupid.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 We are going to Vietnam for 2 weeks late March with my wife (28 and 25 year old): 5 days in HCM, 3days in Phu Quoc and 5days in Hanoï.
 ​
 In Hanoï we are thinking going there:
  
Hanoi Train Streets
 Ha Long Bay : do you recommend 2days/1night or 3days/2nights?
 Vietnam Military History Museum
 Hoàn Kiếm Lake
 Don Xuan market
 French quarter
  
​
 HCM:
  
Ben Thanh market
 An Dong market
 War remnants Museum
 Vincom Center
 Nam Cat Tien park
 Nguyen Hue walk
 Mekong Delta
  
​
 Do you have any recommendations or advices? 
 Also, I am a bit clueless on the best transportation to go to Ha Long Bay or Mekong Delta. In the city, I planned to use Grab or Go-jek.
 ​
 Thanks in advance :)

 Since I&#x27;ll be visiting several factories in the region, traveling by cars, would it be considered inappropriate or disrespectful if I wear shorts? 
 Any suggestions are welcome!! Thank you in advance!!

                              <span>I’ll be in Vietnam for a month soon with another month in Thailand before i return to Vietnam for another few weeks. I live in Europe and I’m not sure how mobile networks work outside European Union. I’m looking for a good few GBs of data 20-30GB allowance with a few national calls for hostels and local calls. Do Vietnamese providers offer roaming in neighbouring countries like you’d get in Europe? What are the prices like and what are my options? All help appreciated.
 I actually work for a big provider in my home country where it’s unlimited national data + 19GB anywhere in the EU for €20 . I’d love to find something similar if possible.

                              <span>I am not from there, but curious if it makes sense as a retirement plan for us. Cheaper cost of living? Visa issues? Recommandations on what parts of the country would make sense? Buying home? Medical issues? I&#x27;ve been there many times but considering long term life as a retired person. Anyone here do it?

                              <span>Two years ago I was constantly seeing stories about how Vietnam had the highest economic growth in Southeast Asia. Was getting massively invested in by Japan and Korea, and had tons of companies relocating to it from China during the Sino-American trade war. Many YouTubers I was watch on the ground said they could see the explosive growth year by year as it felt like the early days of China as it was beginning to achieve great economic success. The everyday life was becoming tangibly better year by year.
 But I checked in again recently, and I saw the GDP growth has massively faltered the past two years, and also saw that the previous economics minded president has seemingly been replaced by a more politics minded one.
 So I was just wondering, does Vietnam still seem to be on track for explosive growth and this is just a short break because of COVID or is the growth really slowing down? Is life still improving year by year in Vietnam to a noticable degree?

                              <span>Hi, I am on Phu Quoc right now and I see it again. Huuuuge luxury hotels, but nearly completely empty. When I look the price up its 5M Dong a night. 5M Dong. 
 How do these luxury hotels even survive? Why they don’t lower the price?
 It seems like the hotel owners are so crazy rich they don’t care about some losses and don’t want to lower the prices to not lose image or something. (imagine you pay $200 for a hotel and some months later it’s $100 a night because of low demand. in Europe or also in Thailand, hotels dgaf and just lower the price to get at least some customers, but here it’s not like that). Or?? I can’t understand it pls explain me guys
 Also this Vin Grand World has sooo many restaurants and stuff with expensive food, but most of them are completely empty because it’s too expensive when you could get outside the same food for much lower price. 
 It seems like the “market” with demand offer etc doesn’t really work for these giants they just dgaf about losses, or is there some bigger story behind that? I also remember how people in this sub once talked how expensive vinfast cars became or smth like that

                              <span>Sorry if this has been asked before. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if a large number of people in Vietnam want to immigrate to other countries(specifically the West) or if this is government propaganda in the West trying to put down other countries to make themselves look better by comparison. 
 Thanks for your help in advance!

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Have you stayed in a hotel in the Old Quarter recently?
 I visited Hanoi in 2018, 2019 and again in 2022. The hotels had changed a lot in 3 years as many had been affected by Covid and the flood damage. While no doubt it&#x27;s down to the unfortunate circumstances, the last couple of places I stayed in 2022 were nothing like the photos/reviews, were damaged and run down.
 Bringing the family along in 2023 and would like to know your recommendations for a nice place to stay.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I visited Hanoi for a few weeks and went to some clubs too. In most clubs the sold balloons and I was told they contain laughing gas. Saw some people getting really high on it and kinda knocked out sometimes.
 Friend handed me (already very drunk) one and I tried it several times excessively but had no reaction.
 First, I don&#x27;t know if laughing gas is illegal. Some clubs were really suspicious and you had to talk to some guy around a corner to get through some secret gate. Somehow you couldn&#x27;t here any of the loud music outside.
 And second could we get scammed? Is selling fake gas a thing? I&#x27;m not a fan and won&#x27;t do it ever again, but I&#x27;m really interested in understanding what happened there.

                              <span>Hi Everyone, Yeah it&#x27;s another Vietnam itinerary.
 I&#x27;m traveling with my wife from India to spend around 2 weeks in this country on our anniversary. Need help in making an itinerary that has a balance of both a little fast and relaxed overall.
 But I&#x27;m too confused to jot down the itinerary completely, mainly in the number of days to spend in a city. Some parts are fixed though.
 Fixed (15 days): 14th April &#x27;23 to 28th April &#x27;23,
 Flights Booked and stay booked for Phu Quoc
 14th arrival (Ho Chi Minh) Going to Phu Quoc directly
 14th to 16th (Phu Quoc)
 28th departure (Hanoi)
 I want to cover the country from south to central to the north, with the 19th being preferred not traveling as it&#x27;s our anniversary that day.
 Uncertain (16th to 28th):
 No Stay or Travel option booked
 16th to 18th: Ho Chi Minh Stay
 18th to 19th: Nha Trang, can this be skipped? as it&#x27;ll make us travel on the 19th to Hoi An/Da nang
 19th to 21st: Hoi An, Da nang, and Ba Na Hills (Unable to select dates to stay where on which date, maximizing things to do in each place)
 22nd to 28th: Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Sa pa
 We want to cover Ninh Binh and Phong Nha National Park as well but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible as this above draft itself feels a little rushed. We are already removed Dalat and Hue from our itinerary for the same reason, doesn&#x27;t want it to be too fast-paced.
 Now I want help with what place we can omit if this itinerary looks too rushed or not possible.
 Any other suggestion for a newbie in Vietnam please do suggest!

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 Has anyone ever heard of a store in Saigon called Kallos? It’s located in D10 and they have items I want to get for myself and others, however I cannot find anyone (so far) who has either heard of them or shopped there. 
 They’re an outlet (similar to Vincom) and have excellent professional reviews and items, nice FB page, reviews and it’s run by a Korean man who opened up his own shop. But it would be very reassuring to know if someone has actually shopped here before. 
 If either anyone here, or you have someone who has shopped here before, please let me know and the most important let me know if the products you bought were authentic or fake because this is what I’m worried about more than anything. I attach an image of the address and business as well. Kallos Vietnam

Now while I saw him grab them out of the Zepam 10 packet they are obviously sealed still. They don’t have the MS engraved in them just a cross on one side most of the pictures online look to have an MS as well. What do we think?

 Anh cùng đang cô gắng tự học Tiếng Việt rồi nếu mọi người ơi thể recommend những có gì anh có thể bài tạp. I would be quite grateful.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a driver&#x27;s license in Germany for cars only and I have a Vietnamese passport but my residence is in Germany.
 I would like to bring an international Driver&#x27;s license back to Vietnam to ride a motorbike legally. I know I just need to do a practical test.
 My question is: will my licence have a short expiry date like foreigners who stay in Vietnam for a limited time? Or will the license expiration date be the same as my driver&#x27;s licence in Germany because I have Vietnamese citizenship? I have no residence in Vietnam.
 My plan is to use the license again for multiple visits. It will take time for the license to be issued, so I can&#x27;t afford the time to get the license every time I visit Vietnam.
 (Yes, I know I can drive illegally and bribe officers, but I want my health and liability insurance to pay for higher damages if I ever get into a serious accident)

 Tôi sẽ đánh giá cao nếu bạn có thể hiểu rằng dư luận Hàn Quốc phần lớn cũng đang chỉ trích Bộ trưởng. Dù vậy chính phủ hiện nay đang bị chỉ trích rất nhiều nhưng không ngờ Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng lại làm như vậy... Go Vietnam
 As a Korean, I feel embarrassed about this incident. I regret the terrible things that happened during the Vietnam War.
 I would appreciate it if you could understand that Korean public opinion is largely criticizing the Minister as well. Although the current government is being criticized a lot, it is unexpected that the Defense Minister would do such a thing... Go Vietnam

                              <span>I dropped my phone resulting in my screen breaking. This phone is a Huawei p30. I will be in Vietnam for another two weeks and then onto Cambodia so need a solution. 
 Does anyone know if this can be cheaply fixed in Vietnam. I am aware lcd screens can be costly. We are going to Nha Trang next, then Ho Ch Minh and Phu Quoc.
 Should I just buy a new/second hand phone? If so, any recommendations where I could buy one from. Thanks!

                              <span>I’ll be spending two weeks across Vietnam in March and would like to visit places where I can learn about the history of your country. I understand that there are plenty of museums in Hanoi and Saigon, but I’m curious to hear about other historically significant locations that can be visited and learned from as a tourist. 
 Large graves, temples, war zones, etc.. are of interest, if possible.

                              <span>I lived in Hanoi from 2005 to 2007 (Vietnamese second gen, went back with my parents so I could learn the language and culture) and then visited during the summers until around 2010. I really want to go back at some point and I’m curious as to how much Hanoi has changed. Some things I remember:
 Roads were like 90% motorcycles, 7% cars, and 3% bikes
 Sông tô lịch was literally just an open sewer (please tell me this has gotten better lmao)
 No one wore seatbelts, and while I was there when people began being required to wear helmets, a lot of people wouldn’t buckle them
 Cutting in line was very common 
 Crosswalks weren’t a thing, you just walked across the street and people swerved around you
 Has any of this changed?

 Just about to visit Vung Tau for a day and wanted to know of any top good hook ups or best things to do.

 I know there&#x27;s that one viral Vietnamese song on TikTok, but it&#x27;s a bit too cutesy and sugary to really be a &quot;theme song&quot;. I also don&#x27;t know, or think, that there&#x27;s quite an equivalent to Gangnam Style for South Korea, but if I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;d like to hear it.

 First post here because I am panicking. I am travelling to Vietnam TOMORROW. I have no travel/health insurance. Some websites still list it as a requirement. Is it actually ?!! It is not written on my country’s embassy’s website. 
 Please help clarify this for me. I am so stressed and scared that I can’t travel .

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for almost a month. I&#x27;ve heard GREAT tales of how awesome the food is but through out my travels I&#x27;ve had one or two memorable meals until tonight. 
 Era was recommended by my hotel but I had low expectations. I&#x27;m happy to say that the food and service were magnificent. 
 Duan and his wife are foodies and it shows in the taste and presentation of the good eats they serve at their restaurant. After a short chat I learned that Duan is self-taught cook and that he and his wife love to experiment with recipes. His methodology puts me in mind of a food scientist. 
 I left very full. Very happy. And, very satisfied. I finally had a meal that was worth all the hype.

                              <span>Thao and the staff on the boat for the Halong Bay Tour were phenomenal. 
 I was on a tour with another company when I realized the return time to Halong Bay City would make me late for a transfer to Hanoi. I was assured at booking that there would not be a conflict but that was not the case. 
 I saw Thao&#x27;s boat departing (a completely different company) and asked if I could hitch a ride back to the city with them. Both the captain and Thao, the tour guide, agreed to let me come along. 
 But, it gets better. Thao called my hotel so I could grant permission for the transfer driver to pick-up my luggage. 
 He also called the transport company to arrange an alternate pick-up location and changed my pick up time. Then Thao had one of his wait staff to rush me to the new pick-up location on the back of her scooter. Thanks to them I made it to Hanoi and now sit comfortably in my hotel room. 
 Thao refused a tip and I paid a nominal fee to the captain and the waitress/motorbike driver. In fact, the waitress returned half of the very small fee I paid her and refused when I insisted she keep all of it. 
 I&#x27;m so grateful to Thao and the staff for helping a complete stranger. They truly went above and beyond earning them the LifeSaver award. Many thanks to them all.

 This was my experience. Punctual transport from my hotel to the pier. 
 Great communication via Airbnb although start times displayed on the site when booking are incorrect. I confirmed that if I took the 11:30am tour that I would be back in time for 5:30pm pick up for my private transfer to Hanoi. I was assured that I would not miss pick-up. 
 My group was escorted by a coordinator inside and instructed to sit down where we were abandoned for approximately 40 minutes. One couple left because we did not know who we were waiting for, if anyone would return, or where we were going. 
 The coordinator returns, hands out tickets and then led us to the …</span>

                              <span>I love living in Vietnam 🇻🇳 ❤️ but the thing that kills me is the unnecessarily LOUD TRUCK HORNS. My ears hurt and it startles me (sometimes to the point of crashing) every time one of them decides to blare their cargo ship horn near me. I get alerts on my Apple Watch all the time about how the noise level could cause hearing loss. Oh and the way they drive is insane too! This happens all the time: a big ol 🚛 barreling down the road in the lane traveling the opposite direction from me ENTERS INTO MY LANE, and almost literally RUNS ME OFF THE ROAD. Keep in mind, as a guy driving a motorbike, I’m already in the habit of riding on the very edge of the road, but in the interest of safety, I’ve had to go off the road so many times because some impatient cargo truck driver can’t stand to behind another car so they invade a lane of oncoming traffic whenever they feel like it.
 Back to the horn problem…it has caused numerous deaths. It’s so loud that it had caused people to be startled to the point of falling off their motorbike and getting hit by the semi trucks or getting into deadly accidents with other vehicles from loss of control. It happens too much, and although there is technically a law against it but the penalty (like 2-3tr vnđ) is so light compared to the damage it causes.

                              <span>Hi all, I’m a Vietnamese American who does dragon boat over in the US. I was curious about teams over in Vietnam since I haven’t really seen any Vietnamese appearances at international competitions online. If anyone could point me to the existence of a national team or just any team in Vietnam so that I can keep up on social media, that’d be much appreciated!

                              <span>I have a package from Hong Kong. They are upgraded parts for a small machine.
 I bought them from a store in China, it costs about 365 dollars. The store decided to deliver my package by Fedex (Air way).
 It was shipped quickly from HongKong to Ho Chi Minh for about 3 days, but then it got stuck at a clearance process for over a week. Now I have no clue what I need to do next since Fedex Vietnam keeps asking me to wait.
 For those having the same experiences, is that your typical durations for an import custom process to Vietnam? This is a first time I buy a product from foreign countries so I am little shock.

 Iced milk coffee
 According to the culinary website Taste Atlas, Vietnam&#x27;s iced coffee ranks second among the top 10 best coffees in the world.
 Taste Atlas describes, Vietnamese iced coffee is a combination of dark black coffee with condensed milk and ice.
 Traditionally, iced milk coffee must be made from medium or coarsely ground Vietnamese coffee, typically Robusta.
 The way to make Vietnamese coffee is also unique, unlike anywhere else in the world when pouring hot water through a small filter to let each drop of concentrated coffee flow into the cup, then it will be mixed with condensed milk and added ice.
 Please enjoy once if you have the opportunity to visit Vietnam.

                              <span>Hello, I am currently traveling with my girlfriend in Vietnam and we have some questions about the phone service. In Saigon we bought a SIM for 200,000d. Even though he only half understood us, we were pretty sure he meant we have 4gb per day for 30days. (is this Even a possible price?) After 5 days the internet stopped working. I had internet again the next day and got a message in the evening the 1gb/day was used up. You get but on dozens of other messages that tell something about tariffs but translated only make half sense. Can I ignore them? (I know this from South America where you were often spammed with fake stuff). And do you know which messages you can take seriously?
 Also, how does the charging work? I have seen that there is a short code *101#. In general, I am a bit clueless and would need someone to explain the whole thing to me. Thanks in advance!
 Viettel btw

                              <span>Hey guys, has anyone done this loop recently? And were there any police controls over there? I&#x27;m fairly comfortable driving around in Vietnam but don&#x27;t have an internationals drivers license, just a regular driver&#x27;s license.

                              <span>In South Korea, some schools have optional/mandatory Hanja (han characters) classes, it&#x27;s used for stylistic reasons, abbreviation, clarity, etc.
 Koreans also know their Hanja names for official documents, do Vietnamese people know theirs?
 Does Vietnam use han characters like South Korea or less so?

                              <span>Vietnam is the 36th)-largest in the world as measured by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and 26th)-largest in the world as measured by purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2022. But the GDP per capita is still low, ranking at 117th_per_capita) and they are still dependent on foreign ODA. So when do you think they can reach the same level as other SEA countries Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia?

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 Quick question again, basically I have very specific hair needs since I have nice, natural curly hair. There is a specific moisture cream that makes my curls extremely luxurious that I really cannot do without now. Because otherwise my hair will be very dry and frizzy and coarse. 
 My question, would my package either be seized or held up with customs when shipping the product? Mind you, I will not be shipping any electronics or perishables (food) or anything like this ever, I would only ever need to order skin/hair care from South Korea to Vietnam. The shop I order from is KoreaDepart, they ship everywhere, however my question is not with them it’s about can I get the products into Vietnam without being seized or held up and having to pay out the ass in fees. 
 The product…</span>

 Would you suggest doing a motorbike tour from Hoi An to Hue? Are there enough things to see or better to just take a taxi/bus?
 ​
 Thanks - only have 2 days in Hoi An, and 2 days in Hue.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking if its possible to do overnight jungle trekking in Vietnam, relatively rural. I was in Indonesia last summer and am heading to Vietnam this summer and am looking for more jungle trekking, maybe 2 nights 3 days. 
 Where in Vietnam has the best rainforest? I&#x27;m really interested in seeing the most amazing wildlife possible - in Indonesia for instance I saw Orangutans. 
 Does Vietnam or Cambodia have better wildlife rainforests?

                              <span>I see posts a lot where it is usually a foreigner marrying a girl from VN. However, does anyone have experience with marrying a man from VN as a foreigner?
 I&#x27;m not really a foreigner either, I&#x27;m a VK but don&#x27;t speak vietnamese at all, but I do speak a chinese dialect and was able to get around a little in VN when I was there for 1 month. During that time, I met someone that is too perfect. We aren&#x27;t dating, just friends, we met accidently. His family runs a little food shop/stand and I couldn&#x27;t speak Vietnamese so he stepped in to help and we just started talking since I was there during slow business time.
 Prior to that I also thought about moving to VN to stay closer to family. I also like VN but I feel like I am romanticizing it too much and the reason I like it is because I can escape from my problems (work burnout).
 ​
 I don&#x27;t really know what I really want to ask. I just want to hear from people about their experience. Since men and women in VN can be different in a relationship because of culture. I don&#x27;t want to start a relationship and get his hopes up since he is older than me with aging parents.

                              <span>Hello Everyone!
 Does anyone know how to get your social security insurance contributions or a law firm that could help? 
 I am moving back to the states and was told by my HR Rep that the government can only give me a plaque/certificate with the years worked, not MONEY
 I am owed a decent amount of money and the government has refused to pay, I heard this was also a problem in china but know of friends getting their money there.

                              <span>I remember being very interested in Vietnam&#x27;s Tay Son period ever since I was as young as 7, and I remember always feeling extremely unwell hearing about all these Tay Son bloodlines and everything, including famous generals like Bùi Thị Xuân and her daughter getting stomped to death by elephants. Or the ensuing executions of Nguyễn Nhạc&#x27;s children by having them sawed in half. Despite it being years later, I still feel sad reading about the infamous Nguyen Lord and later Gia Long&#x27;s rampage against Quang Trung&#x27;s monarch. But then It is also my responsibility to be aware that part of his bloodlust was also due to the fact that he had witnessed the killings against his own family when the Tay Son swept down South.
 Humans are scary.
 If anyone else has any insight or corrections which I know will be inevitably pointed out, I would totally love to hear them and see what else I needed to learn about this event.

                              <span>I’m going to Vietnam next month, going from Ho Chi Minh, through central Vietnam and ending in Hanoi. 
 I don’t eat pork or shellfish , and would prefer not to eat any other meat such as chicken or beef. 
 How easy will it be to find options that are ‘chay’ when I am out exploring? How easy will it be to avoid fish sauce, which I know contains shrimp, for example? 
 Is there anything I could buy in a supermarket that is vegetarian that I could quickly grab and go, if I’m in a hurry ?
 Many thanks! 😊

 Of course staying cautious, being aware of surroundings, are basic wonderful tips. 
 But what are some ADVANCED tips that you would recommend? 
 One tip i have received, is buying an AirTag, and putting it on personal belongings. This is great way of utilizing technology we have in 2023.

                              <span>I have been looking into getting a loan in Vietnam as a foreigner for a property purchase. 
 Did not have much luck with banks. Most do not offer loans for foreigners, or people living outside of HN or SG. Vietnam Russia Bank (VRB) seemed to be the easiest for foreigners. 
 I then found Homebase and it seemed too perfect. But the more I read about them in both English and Vietnamese media, the more they seem legit. Though it&#x27;s hard to find much reviews from customers that aren&#x27;t their own promotional material.
 Does anyone know of any experiences with them? Interested hearing both Vietnamese and foreigner experiences.
 If not familiar, they work like: they initially buy the property and own it, then you buy it back from them at a pre-agreed upon price (at any time). You&#x27;re allowed use the property while buying back.

                              <span>I was flying to Tokyo and i got to the check in counter only to be told i needed 3 doses instead of 2. I was directed to the office but a guy stepped up yo me and offered to get me a pcr test to let me fly for $200. In a panic, i agreed and he did some stuff and got me the test, but the gate was closed. So basically i had to buy a flight ticket to Osaka for a little bit later ($455) because i was told i couldn’t get any refund or transfer for the ticket i had + my visa for Vietnam was over today. I then had to pay the guy 4 mil for the pcr and sprinted to make my flight. In addition, new flight from Osaka Just ran into another guy in Osaka who was at the airport and he said the fake pcr was not only 150 but i could have just paid 1 mil to have my ticket changed until i could get a real pcr test for cheap. I feel like an idiot although i know i was just panicked and wanted nothing more than to make it to Tokyo so I’m out $700 extra dollars.

I&#x27;m trying not to schedule a taxi service so I can look for a currency exchange (just for that night&#x27;s funds) and data only SIM card (Vietel or other). I&#x27;ll arrive at about 10pm local time.

                              <span>Recently, I have been reading about the Doi Moi policy, which the Communist Party or Vietnam (CPV) implemented in 1986. 
 A lot of articles and videos I found on the Internet tend to praise the policy for transforming Vietnam into a rising economy in the ASEAN region, surpassing my country (the Philippines) and others in terms of economic growth and development. 
 I even watched a video from Bloomberg about how North Korea once planned of adopting Vietnam-style reforms to open and grow its economy before the COVID-19 pandemic.
 So I want to know what this sub thinks of Doi Moi. Should other developing countries like the Philippines and North Korea follow Vietnam&#x27;s example? Was it effective in bringing prosperity to Vietnam?

                              <span>I’m curious, has anyone ever been to “Tuyết Thành” - outside of Saigon? What’s it like? How hard is it to get to from Saigon?
 “Tuyết Thành, or &quot;Snowy Citadel&quot; in English, is a city located just 35 kilometers outside of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite being situated in a tropical region, Tuyết Thành is renowned for its year-round snowfall, which is a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for years.”
 “The snow in Tuyết Thành is a stunning sight to behold, falling softly from the sky to create a winter wonderland that is both surreal and magical. The snow is powdery and light, making it perfect for building snowmen or engaging in snowball fights. The cause of this phenomenon remains a mystery, but locals speculate that it&#x27;s due to a unique combination of climatic and geographic factors. Nonetheless, Tuyết Thành is a popular destination for tourists seeking an extraordinary winter experience in Vietnam.”

                              <span>So I&#x27;m an expat who&#x27;s been living in HCMC since 2017 but have always lived in an apartment building, so I&#x27;ve never had to worry about the ISP I used for my internet. I&#x27;m moving into a house for the first time and have to get my own internet. I&#x27;ve noticed that my banking app has options to pay for Internet and the options are FPT and Viettel. Considering the recent state of the internet in my current apartment (undersea cable blah blah and all), I thought I&#x27;d ask which of these are the best option.

                              <span>So I recently made a post about shipping an open-box ps4 to my cuz in HCMC using an independent Viet shipper here, and it got held up at customs. That’s what the shipper told me anyway. 
 I’ve decided to ship her a brand new console in the box and everything. What shipping should I use to ensure that she’ll get it? I have UPS, FedEx, DHL, regular postal service. 
 Any tips on filling out customs paperwork and stuff to make sure it gets through? 
 If you’re wondering why I’m not giving her the money to just buy one, I got this ps5 as a gift for free so I can’t justify shelling out $500-600.
 Edit: extra words

                              <span>Hey All, I saw someone posting about shipping VR here but im debating to just buy local.
 Anyone into it? Im new to it however i have some cash to blow on a good setup.
 Anyone buy locally or suggest any good shops? Id rather not piece ship it internationally and if i dont have to rather not buy when i head to US and put it on the plane. 
 I debated steams full setup and a new PC to run it. I am really going to focus on a realistic driver setup(minus the moving hydrolic chair stuff) and flight simulator to learn how to fly.
 Hanoi is ok to but prefer Saigon.
 Open to people commenting on setups also if they have experience since im a noob to it all

                              <span>Hi Saigon Redditors, 
 Any budget hotel you can recommend within D1? I am looking thru Booking right now but open to hear about personal reccomendations based on stay experience. I kinda need to move out of my rented place tomorrow. If you want the story I will oblige, but really need to find and book a place tonight. 
 I just need a name that is it.
 Cam on!

                              <span>hey there,
 I am traveling to Vietnam next month from Australia. I am trying to figure out what kind of travel adapter I need but not having much luck. Was hoping someone on this thread might be able to point me in the right direction. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I need to order a few unique accessories for a VR headset from abroad, and I&#x27;ve never in my life used websites like amazon/ubuy/etc. 
 I&#x27;m not familiar with shipping to Vietnam and wanted to get some insights here from the people who have experience with this.
 Which service would you recommend (Amazon, etc.)? Would it be 100% reliable? What obstacles might exist there? And is it as easy as simply ordering on the website and waiting for delivery, or would I need to personally contact customs to pay any extra fees? 
 I live in Central Vietnam so it would not be possible for me to go to Hanoi or HCMC to deal with customs.

                              <span>What’s the price of a decent laptop in Vietnam? I live in the UK and was going to buy one roughly around £650 (~18.5 million vnd), will use it for school work and also some gaming. Would it be cheaper for me just to wait until I move there and then buying one there? Sorry, I am not aware of the prices of things like this in Vietnam, thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I came to the US in 2005 with a passport that was issued in 2003 (expired in 2008). I am currently a permanent resident. My boss is asking me if I want to go overseas for a couple months for business trips in April. However, I do not know if I can even renew my original passport or can I just get a new one? I am near DC so I can just drive there for passport service instead of mailing documents in.

                              <span>I am in my last 6 months of schooling and want to take my CELTA certification to come teach in Vietnam. I was really set on Hanoi, but from what I have been reading it is apparently not a very walkable city. Here in the US, I do not own a car and very rarely drive. I have taken public transportation my whole life and really prefer that to owning/paying for a car.
 I am a bit freaked out by the idea of renting a scooter given how hectic the roads are, but I will do it if that&#x27;s what it takes to come live in Vietnam. But I was wanting to ask how feasible is it to walk and use public transport in Hanoi, or if there is a better city that is suited for this that is not HCMC? What about places outside major cities? Thanks for your help

                              <span>Hello everyone, Maybe the Redditors here can help me out. I&#x27;m trying to look for insurance companies in Vietnam that provides coverage for COVID-19 for tourists. I&#x27;m NOT looking for insurance coverage for an Expat staying long term. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, a minimum coverage of at least $10,000 is a requirement for entry. Any and all suggestions welcome. Thank you.

 ​
 Has anyone run into Facebook not paying you when you are traveling around to different countries like Vietnam? Is there anything you can do?

                              <span>I have a co-worker that picked me up because of snow and ice on the roads. I have worked with him for around 8 years and respect him so much because he has taught me a lot at our job. I want to buy him something for the kind gesture of picking me up to show him my thanks that wouldn&#x27;t be included in a &quot;gas money&quot; 10 dollar bill. Gas money seems to impersonal to me.
 He is in his 50&#x27;s. Married with a kid. What could I get him that would show my gratitude while also my respect for his culture? I appreciate him being him and want to be respectful.
 Any help is much appreciated. Thank you.

 Is Phu Cuoc overcrowded now? What about Mui Ne?
 Safe for foreigners? Any kidnappings / crazy shit? Are the Russian tourists causing any problems?
 How easy is it renting a car? Or what’s the best way of getting around?

                              <span>Im new to Reddit so not sure how to post text with pictures. After posting this incidents in some FB groups, people shared their similar experiences so it happens quite a lot. I have never thought someone dares to steal in this area where there are so many security cameras
 Summary: - Before going through security screening, I took off my watch, put it in my purse. My purse didn&#x27;t have zipper or lock. Put my purse lying down next to my husband&#x27;s bag, in the same tray. (XRAY MACHINE IMAGE confirmed there was watch in my purse) - My husband push the bag tray in Xray machine then went through body scan. Then another man jumped in while I was taking off my shoes. I let him since I didn&#x27;t want to delay other people - I went through body scan after pushing the shoe tray in Xray - Right after that, I got my purse back from my husband at the conveyor belt. I STOOD RIGHT THERE AND SEARCHED FOR THE WATCH, it was gone. I walked a little further (about 10 steps) to avoid blocking the way and took all stuff out of my purse to search for it. Nothing - 1 minute later (YES WE HAVE CAMERA FOOTAGE), my husband went back to the conveyor belt area to check all the trays around. Found nothing - I reported the issue to the airport security team. No official report, no help from them. Later I had to fly back to Phu Quoc to make a scene and got official report and watched camera footage and Xray machine images.

                              <span>Hello! I am in Hanoi next month and given that Vietnam is one of the world&#x27;s biggest garment manufacturers, I am seeking shops that sell overstock clothing/shoes/gear from western brands (ie, Athleta, North Face, J. Lindeberg, etc.) 
 Any locations shared would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I recently visited Ho Chi Minh City and was amazed by the quality and unique designs of the helmets for kids. I think there is a great potential for such a business in India, and I am interested in exploring the possibility of importing these helmets.
 I am looking for helmet suppliers who can ship to India. Specifically, I am looking for suppliers who specialize in helmets for kids. I would appreciate any recommendations or suggestions on where I can find such suppliers.
 If you are a helmet supplier based in Ho Chi Minh City and are interested in exploring the Indian market, please reach out to me. I am keen to learn more about your products and services.
 Thank you in advance for your help and support. I look forward to hearing from you!

 If you know good spots up in Hanoi too, that’d be cool. Willing to take any local recommendations for any dish as well. I understand that best can be difficult to define and tends to be subjective, so whatever you tell me I’ll look into.
 Thanks!

 All references I can find for learning the language indicate that words like chào like in xin chào are pronounced the same way we would in English, like chow, choice, chomp etc.
 Down here in the south people pronounce it with more of a g sound as in growl, gouge, graph. My wife says this is not true, but to my ear that&#x27;s what it sounds like.

                              <span>So Im currently in negotiations to work with a well established startup in vn.
 They have already received 2 rounds of funding for 12 million USD and have yearly sales of almost 50 million. They are doing well and employing around 75 people, including native engineers and many skilled factory workers. 
 After this month of brutal internet, the series B round funders have issued an ultimatum for them to move design out of vietnam immediately. This was very embarrassing after a month of video call after video call was dropped; we were having a terrible time accessing code repositories hosted out of country, and a bunch of other problems due to new products relying on cloud connectivity. 
 the investors are foreign, frankly they have little faith in whats going on here. They seem to believe its not just a coincidence of all the internet cables but one breaking down; but rather a systematic problem, either in infrastructure, or govt mismanagement. They visited earlier this month, met with city officials in ho chi minh, and were appalled at the attitude, as well as conditions around the city, and believe growth in a high tech field will only be impeded by being here. 
 Frankly i cant argue. I love what we are working on and hate to have to turn away from this myself, but while they can work hard and compete, they will always be be hamstrung by access to real talent, and the 2nd world infrastructure. There is a culture of inefficiency in vn thinking that fester these kinds of problems. But founder is a rare brilliant vietnamese engineer who came home to make something good here, and looks like they wont be able to stay. 
 Come on vn, get your shit together.

                              <span>I will be going to Hanoi in a couple of weeks and need to book restaurants for me and my colleagues for 2 evenings. We will be staying in the Tay Ho district.
 Do you have any recommendations?
 Everything could be relevant, both fine dining and more casual.

                              <span>Hello all Vietnamese friends, I&#x27;m a white Czech and wanted your opinion on this: I shop a lot at the local Vietnamese store and I really like learning languages, so the last time I went to to the store, I asked the clerk (he may be the owner) if I could try my Vietnamese hello and he was smiling and went along and even tried to teach me more phrases, so I think I wasn&#x27;t rude. Also I was the only one in the store, it was early morning. What are your feelings on this, would you consider it rude or disrespectful? I wouldn&#x27;t try this if they were busy, or if I knew the person was born here, I just like the feedback and maybe it would make them feel more welcomed and make them remember their home country?
 I&#x27;m not sure, have at me!

                              <span>I’m seeing a lot of conflicting information about busses, travel time and pricing. What’s the best way? It says on maps 3h 17minutes. But most busses say closer to 5h. Money isn’t the issue so what would be our best option? I’ve seen posts saying the direct busses are quite bad. Please advise.

                              <span>Hey guys! My boyfriend and me are currently in Da Nang and we are planning to do a road trip with a motorbike. Any suggestions where we could buy a motorbike for a fair price ? 
 We are planning to visit Cambodia and Thailand as well. (maybe Laos) Are there any difficulties to cross the border ?

                              <span>Hi there. I’m moving to HCMC next month for work and I was just wondering how much dating differs to how it does in the west. I am a 23 year old boy from the UK and I have lived in Thailand for a year, is it similar? Also just to be clear I’m not talking about sex tourism, I’m on about actual dating someone, boyfriend girlfriend etc. Thank you

 How easy is it to get new sim cards with mobile internet plans as a foreigner? How is the network and internet speeds? How much do they usually cost?
 Do most cafes have wifi?

 I am a musician and music teacher in Canada. I teach at a school with students from all around the world and every week we listen to music from a different country. We are going to be exploring Viet Nam next.
 Can you recommend me some music to show my students? They are between ages 9-12 and we’re open to music from any genre.
 Thank you

 This is exactly how I feel trying to learn the Vietnamese pronouns, except that in Vietnam you have to guess a woman&#x27;s pronoun (based on age) without asking her and you get the evil eye if you get it wrong, lol.

We are mostly looking for mountains or a place with pleasant weather in April. I have narrowed down to below places, but my parents can not trek, due to bad knees. Also we dont want it to be a hectic trip and want some time to enjoy a place as well. Can you please suggest me the places I can skip ? Vietnam : 1. Hanoi 2. Sapa 3. Ninh binh 4. Halong bay 5. Cat ba island 6. Mai chau 7. Pu luong 8. Moc chau 9. Ha giang
 Also, country other than Vietnam is also welcome(except Europe,since we can travel for 9 days only) .

                              <span>TW/CW: ANIMAL ABUSE, ANIMAL DEATH, HA#Gi#G 
 Hello there I’m not Vietnamese but I stumble upon a video on Facebook about a case of a pet salon where the workers unprofessionalism ended up in a dog’s death, by doing my research I found the original video on YouTube it’s called chewy hung to death at a pet spa by Brent Strydom (I really recommend not watching the video as it was incredibly graphic and horrible to see what happens to the dog) the user called Brent strydom seems to have been the owner of chewy and was claiming justice for what happened, it was uploaded on 2017 so idk if it got resolved or not since comments are deactivated and he didn’t left any social media on his channel to contact him so if anyone may know something about this case please let me know

 Tôi sẽ sử dụng ý tưởng &quot;Văn hóa Việt Nam&quot; cho một cuộc thi nghệ thuật. Tôi cần một số ý tưởng, vậy khi bạn nghe &quot;văn hóa Việt Nam&quot;, điều gì xuất hiện trong đầu? 
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều! :)

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s partly because of the CSGT not enforcing traffic laws, but in Australia and I assume other places at least 2/3 of the reason people follow traffic rules is because the public will publicly shame you if you don&#x27;t and if you&#x27;re unlucky someone will punch your face in. But it seems even the good drivers in Vietnam just roll over and accept it when someone tries to murder them on the roads.

                              <span>Im in the US. My cuz is in HCMC. Shipped her a game console but it got held up. The shipper says it’s in the warehouse at the airport pending some customs issues. They didn’t explain a lot. I shipped electronics before with no problems. Should I just assume that it’s lost at this point? The shipper said to wait 2-3 weeks. It’s coming up on 3 weeks and they’re not returning my calls. 
 Anyone encountered this issue? Are there specific products that warrant more scrutiny?

                              <span>I’ve been wanting to do the Ha Giang loop this next time I visit Vietnam, which was supposed to be mid/late April. However, our trip might have to be pushed back a few weeks, and I’m worried about the start of the rainy season interfering with good driving/riding conditions. My partner and I both have decent experience on motorbikes, but we haven’t decided if we want to do the EasyRider option or drive ourselves. Any input on weather considerations for the overall experience would be amazing!

                              <span>Cock Bait. There&#x27;s a bird of the feathered variety living somewhere outside my apartment. It never seems to sleep. It just makes the same incessant, droning &quot;Do do do do, dodoo&quot; all night and all day every ight and everyday. I have a feeling someone owns it but it must bother them too. Surely it keeps hundreds of people awake at night and infuriated during the day. Anyone experienced the same? (Don&#x27;t know what it looks like but I want to kill it!) Crap vegetarian, Hanoi.

                              <span>Hello r/vietnam,
 We are four friends who are planning a trip to Southeast Asia between December 2023 and January 2024. As we begin to plan our itinerary, we are hoping to find a relaxing spot where we can unwind and swim towards the end of our trip.
 We&#x27;ve heard so much about the natural beauty of your countries and we would love to experience it firsthand. As described in the post on r/laos linked below, we would like to do a wild experience in the first weeks. We are hoping to find a beach or lake where we can enjoy some peace and quiet at the end of our travel. We are also hoping to find a spot with some amenities nearby, like restaurants or shops, but we don&#x27;t want anything too crowded or touristy.
 We would really appreciate any recommendations you might have for a relaxing spot where we can swim and unwind during our trip. We are open to any and all suggestions, so please feel free to share your favorite spots and hidden gems with us.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

                              <span>Verse 1:
 I&#x27;m hopping on a plane
 Leaving right away
 My heart&#x27;s set on a different name
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 My flip-flops and my shorts
 Are waiting at the door
 To explore every hidden nook
 Of Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That&#x27;s never been too clean
 Where the traffic&#x27;s like a symphony
 And the street food&#x27;s obscene
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That&#x27;s got its own soundtrack
 With motorbikes and horns and shouting
 And sunsets that take my breath
 ​
 Verse 2:
 I&#x27;m ready to escape
 This monotonous place
 And see how life&#x27;s done in the East
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 From Pho to Banh Mi
 And everything in between
 The food here is so divine
 In Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 Where coffee&#x27;s a religion
 And there&#x27;s so much life on every street
 That I feel pure elation
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That never seems to sleep
 Where locals bike and tourists gawk
 And the air&#x27;s a little too thick
 ​
 Bridge:
 If I can make it here
 I&#x27;ll make it anywhere
 It&#x27;s up to you
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That&#x27;s got its own kind of magic
 With history that&#x27;s felt at every turn
 And energy that&#x27;s so classic
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That&#x27;s got its own style and flair
 With markets that hustle and bustle
 And a pulse that&#x27;s beyond compare
 ​
 Outro:
 Saigon, Saigon
 I wanna wake up in a city that screams my name
 Saigon, Saigon
 Where the hustle and bustle is always insane.

                              <span>VIP eleven passenger mini van from Da Lat to Nha Trang. Optional hotel pick-up ( I went to the bus station) and drop off directly at your destination hotel. There is one restroom stop on this route. We left on time and arrived on schedule. 
 First of all the staff are excellent. Friendly and helpful check in agent and driver. 
 Have no issue whatsoever with the customer service. For that this vendor earns three stars. 
 Areas of improvement:
 VIP bus was messy. Had water bottles and trash from previous guests. Mini van was a little worn. Not as pristine as the photos but not terrible either. 
 Where Cuc Tung looses stars is the driving experience. It was terrifying. The driver took unnecessary risks. There was low visibility due to fog and rain. Other travelers pulled off unto the side of the road but our driver&#x27;s speed barely slowed down around the twists and turns of the mountain two lane highway And, he regularly passed cars while in blind curves. It was three a* clenching hours I was thankful to have survived. 
 Safety should be a higher priority than timeliness.

 If anyone is interested in buying, feel free to DM.

                              <span>Hi everyone. Easy question. First time in Vietnam. I’ll be landing rather late, around 22:30 so maybe I’ll clear immigration by 11 pm. I have no cash so I’m hoping to withdraw at an atm at the airport. Is there anything open at that time? Thanks.

                              <span>Does anyone know if it is real jade being sold at the tip of Ngu Hanh Son (Marble Mountain) in Da Nang? Where are they sourced?
 I went to most stalls in the area, even the small street vendors and they all claim that the jade they sell is real. I am just curious about the authenticity because their jade were selling for only a fraction of what it would cost in gold stores. For example, some ranged between 50k - 1 mill. Also, what is the deal with the price difference? I assume some may be either fake or real. If anyone is familiar with the area, some advice on where to find an authentic dealer is highly appreciated.

 I‘ll Soon Travel To Vietnam and Want To Know How is your Relation To Cannabis? 
 I Know its Hardly punished By the Gouvernement if they catch you. Does this Happen often? Is the Police Looking especially for weed smokers? It is Hard To Buy ? Or do i Go better By Staying a Month away from it?

                              <span>I have a few questions about the housing market in HCMC. I’m really just asking out of curiosity since I can’t actually purchase a SFR in Vietnam. Reading about Seoul’s fucked-up housing situation kind of freaks me out so I’m kind of curious about what’s happening in HCMC. 
 My aunt “recently” sold their childhood house in D3 of HCMC for ~$500K USD. This is just what I overheard so I could honestly be mistaken, but this seems like a crazy amount for someone in VN to purchase considering the average annual salary of someone in HCMC. The only thing that stands out about this house to me is that it’s unlike the standard tall, narrow row houses with 4+ floors and had two floors, was much “wider” than it was tall, and had a backyard. It was a little out of place relative to the other structures around it. 
 Is this “standard” pricing throughout most of HCMC? Sorry, I know this is a particularly stupid question since HCMC is massive. 
 Do most people in HCMC “dream” about purchasing single family residences or has the goal shifted to purchasing a nice condo? Another family member told me that you can reasonably expect a newer condo to go for about ~$80K USD which still seems disproportionately high for the average salary, but I don’t know. 
 Who is still able to purchase a “house” or a “condo”? 
 Would you say the majority of people in HCMC today were born and raised there or moved there in the last 20 or so years?

                              <span>My wife is traveling to Ha Noi in March and this is our fourth trip to places in Vietnam. Last time she was in Ha Noi she was cold at night. I know. I know. It isn’t very cold… but she wants to know if there is a market or store there that sells warming blankets that you put on a bed and plug into the wall outlet? Where would she get that?

                              <span>How do I unlock my phone? 
 I have a Samsung Galaxy A52 Android phone running on Viettel. I&#x27;m planning to travel to the US and I want to us my phone with one of the carriers there. I checked T-Mobile and my phone&#x27;s technology and band appear to be compatible. But I don&#x27;t know if my phone is unlocked, or how to unlock it.
 I bought it in Danang from one of the big electronic stores. There are three A52 models. Mine is the regular A52 that does not support 5G. Model SM-A525F/DS.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello friends- a friend and I have both realized we have some recollection of a cover of &quot;The Rain&quot; by Orange Juice Jones in Vietnamese existing, and that it was not a freak fever dream from our childhood.
 We are desperate to find it because it is exactly what you would expect from similar covers. (Thai Tai&#x27;s &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; cover is peak 90s cheesy and unexpected.) I am actively combing through my playlists and discography to find it, and am wondering if the song goes by a different title in Vietnamese.
 I recall it was Trung Hanh or someone similar who sang it, but I cannot accurately recall.
 Thanks in advance,
 Keru

                              <span>Many shops require you to forfeit your bag when you walk in, or to put it in a locker.
 Many shops tape up your bag with sticky tape when you buy something.
 Some shops staple your receipt to the bag.
 etc.
  
My question is not why such practices exist (presumably all are somehow intended to minimize theft) and what they might indicate about society---that has been discussed here before.
 Instead, my question is where and how they originated. Can anybody shed light on where, how and when these practices became widespread in VN---and how they spread to become ubiquitous across the country?
 (Obviously these practices are not all unique to VN; that&#x27;s irrelevant.)

                              <span>I&#x27;m long-term renting a house here in VN and like most other houses there is a large-ish altar built in to a wall (complete with switched yellow lights) and another altar above the kitchen hearth. 
 I&#x27;m not Vietnamese and so the concept of ancestor veneration is totally foreign to me, but I appreciate that it&#x27;s a part of the culture here. In my own house though, I really don&#x27;t care. So the kitchen alter is currently holding spices, and the main home alter is bare (I was thinking it&#x27;d be good for books and knickknacks).
 My question: Am I going to offend someone or put them off if they visit my house? Am I exposing myself to some supernatural peril? I&#x27;ve previously lived in places with a mezuzah and Mary in a clamshell and don&#x27;t see how this is different, but my landlady is nice and if using an alter as a spice rack is disrespectful I don&#x27;t want to rock the boat.

                              <span>I am Vietnamese American. I was born in the United States, to Vietnamese Immigrants. Paris By Night for a long long time was my only cultural string to my heritage. I learned everything about Vietnamese culture from them.
 As I understand however, Thuy Nga has been struggling to expand it&#x27;s audience base. The younger generation especially in the US is not as tied into the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War so those older songs ( aren&#x27;t that appealing ). DVD sales are useless now. And the &quot; Young &quot; Singers that Thuy Nga has; well for one thing, they&#x27;re not that good at singing, and they&#x27;re not &quot; Young &quot;. One of Thuy Nga&#x27;s &quot; Young &quot; Singers, Diem Suong is 33 years old. And Nhu Loan is 41. 
 Enter Myra Tran. She was not recruited by Thuy Nga. But rather, came to them through American Idol. She&#x27;s now ( so far at least ) doing pretty well in Vietnam, while having some success in the US with Paris By Night.
 ​
 What do you guys think ? Can Thuy Nga adapt to new audience through Myra Tran ?

                              <span>Hi or xin chào! 
 Three of us, all women 25 to 27 years old from elsewhere, are living in district 3 for a month. 
 Where should we go on our weekends off? 
 What nature-based activities can we do in a weekend? 
 What should we visit after work? 
 Any great local food places? (Not wanting western food thank you) 
 Where should we go for shopping? - clothes, blankets, toiletries and so on :)
 Finally, what instagrams should we follow for recommendations? 
 Cam on, thank you 😊

                              <span>Hoping someone who was in the same situation can help me with the question: I have dual citizenship, one of them is VN. However I&#x27;ve just lost my VN passport and I need to flight somewhere this week. Is it possible to get out of VN using the other passport, which I did NOT use to enter?

 My Vietnamese friends tell me sports gear is relatively less expensive in Vietnam. And, am travelling to Vietnam before I go back to India and then UK. I am an Ironman athlete and have a cycle purchase pending.
 Kind members of this sub - please help a lost person know where to look for cycles to buy in the country. I will take them with me whilst leaving the country. Cycles and sports gear in general.

I use Verizon here in the US and was planning on purchasing the $10/day International Plan, until I saw the International Coverage map and saw that Verizon only offers 3G throughout Vietnam. I was curious if it would be better to just purchase a Vietnamese eSim in advance, and if so where could I? Thank you!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I will stay in Vietnam for several years, and I’m planning to buy a car. I&#x27;m only concerned about the car having a level 2 automated driving system ( I get used to in my country before) or full speed acc. My Vietnamese wife told me when the car was imported to Vietnam, they will cut off this function. But I believe some brands probably can find it.
 Can you recommend a car brand or model that has this system? Thank you a lot!

                              <span>Hey! I want to know if there is any way to ship clothes from vietnam to Canada? I wanna buy some from jennaby.u but it seems they only ship within Vietnam. Does anyone have any idea how to ship those to Canada? Or is there anyone who will come to Canada from vietnam? I&#x27;m willing to pay more but idk how to get them shipped here.

                              <span>Our tour bus just got into an accident on the way from Hanoi to Ha Giang. Everyone involved is safe. I&#x27;m pretty pissed at the driver and bus company though. Driver was driving like an asshole and I&#x27;m not surprised we got into an accident at all. Do I have any recourse here? They put us on another bus that only has room on the floor for the next 4 hours. I would expect some kind of compensation or money back for dealing with this, but as a non-vietnamese speaker I don&#x27;t know what chance I&#x27;ll have to actually get that.
 Edit: The bus company is Ngọc Cường VIP
 It was a head on collision with a commercial delivery truck

 Last night at around 9pm, a small brown dog of about 3kg and 8 months old escaped the house. The dog&#x27;s name is Bơ.
 The neighborhood the dog was lost in is near Kim Mã and Nguyễn Chí Thanh.
 If you have seen the dog or would have any information that could help out, I would appreciate it. Thank you

When I&#x27;m doing research it seems to me that tourist accommodation on beach destinations mostly are big hotels, tall buildings with all sorts of ammeneties, A/C and so on. I&#x27;m curious if there are any areas of Vietnam where the types of rustic low key bungalows/chalets common on e.g. island beaches in Thailand, are the norm?
 Thank you very much for your help and opinions 😊

                              <span>Dear Vietnam Redditors,
 Please, help me understand how Vietnam railways work, as I&#x27;m severely confused...
 I&#x27;m planning on visiting Vietnam in April, and wanted to book SE3 overnight train from Ninh Binh to Dong Hoi in advance. The problem is: I get different options depending on which website I use.
 If I try official dsvn.vn I can book a bed in 6-beds car, operated by, as far as I understand Vietnam Railways itself:
 https://preview.redd.it/wxgfmsgvj0ja1.jpg?width&#x3D;753&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;246be640edd3e9d999b8fc3d4658c29828db0bb6
 If I search through baolau.com, I am presented with 4-Berth sleeping cabin, operated by New Livitrans Express:
 https://preview.redd.it/7zruwhogk0ja1.jpg?width&#x3D;1143&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9c6e0b44d9e051972fdff8c43c82546deb1438e3
 Finally, 12go.asia shows two separate trains, seemingly departing at the very same time: one operated by Vietnam Railways, another by Violette Express Train. Both seems to offer 4-Berth Sleepers?
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/yqnx4uq8l0ja1.jpg?width&#x3D;1147&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;32b9b500ac10f136f14364c06286222c51c4c4bb
 Whom should I trust? Is it a single train with carts by different operators?
 Any help will be greatly appreciated! :)

I broke up with her due to differences in our culture and she kept fighting me over my past. Blocked her from social media in december 2022.
 Met my current girlfriend on Tinder in august 2022 and we hit off right away after meeting each other while I was on holiday in Vietnam. We decided on being exclusively to each other and we both deleted Tinder. I told her eventually I was a divorced man, but she continued to talk to me.

                              <span>Hi all, I don&#x27;t know if anyone has any experience or know anyone but I would like to have a casual photoshoot in Da Nang or Hoi An in March just to commemorate the trip. I was wondering if anyone knows a studio or has contacts or know where I can find a good photographer who can speak English to help us?
 Thank you
