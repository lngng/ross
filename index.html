                              <span>I&#x27;m travelling to HCMC before new years. I&#x27;m meant to be staying for 6 days but thought that might be too long in the city. I&#x27;d like to go to a rural village/ serene place for 2 days before NYE. I&#x27;ve looked into Can Tho and the floating markets look interesting. Any recommendations on places to visit in the country side?

                              <span>Hi all,
 First of all, my situation:
 I&#x27;ve been living in HCMC for almost 2 years now but I&#x27;m thinking of leaving. My reasons are the high rent, the noise and air pollution, and the traffic.
 Rent here is the highest in Vietnam I think, higher than in Ha Noi I&#x27;ve been told.
 About noise, I tried lots of places and honestly outside of &quot;luxury&quot; high rise appartments, other places are affected by noise at night or early morning to the point of being unlivable. I got really depressed once because a place a rented had neighbours arguing all day, karaoke and loud drunk talking at night, funerals,... 
 About air pollution, it&#x27;s worse these days, I can see smog most time I look outside from a high enough floor.
 Traffic is also getting worse. I came to HCMC right at the end of COVID quarantine so it was somewhat normal then, then it got gradually worse. 
 Now my question: I&#x27;m considering moving to another city, probably Da Nang. Is Da Nang really better in terma of rent, noise, air and traffic? I&#x27;ve been there once and think it&#x27;s better but it was just a short trip so I&#x27;m not sure, heard some stories about karaoke in Da Nang so I want to hear more from everyone.

 Do they automatically transfer your checked bags or do I need to run and go get it and recheck to the other airlines?

                              <span>Am I being scammed somehow ?
 I just moved into a studio apartment in D1 in HCMC. Got a decent price: around 7.5mil per month. Just a small bedroom and bathroom, no living room or anything. 
 I wanted to check the electric meter outside my room so I turned off electronics and it wasn’t moving. So far so good. 
 I don’t use the fridge , so it’s been off the whole month. Most of my electric usage is for my A/C that runs about 12 hours per day. Otherwise the only other electricity I use is for charging my laptop, or my projector if I’m using it (rarely).
 Electric bill comes in at the end of the month a staggering 1 million vnd! I speak to a neighbor from the house next door. He says he’s paying around 400k for the entire house! 
 Now I know the price per KW is 3.000 vnđ, but the landlords make a profit by charging 4.000 vnd. So I’m thinking that either my A/C is super congested and using up a ton of electricity or my landlord is somehow screwing me. 
 Any thoughts? I will be talking to him about this issue in 2 days when I pay rent.

                              <span>Hello Vietnam!
 Sorry for another travel post but after reading through the sub, and watching videos I figured making a post may be the best method since I have some unique elements to my inquiry.
 I spent most of the year working on a project that took a lot of my time, it wrapped in November but I have quite a bit of vacation to use up now. I&#x27;ve always wanted to go to Vietnam. I was in a LT relationship that recently ended and so that factored in with the work leave is making me think now may be a good time however, it&#x27;d be a solo trip and pretty spontaneous due to time.
 My travel window would be likely Dec 8 - 21st. Outside of the US, I&#x27;ve traveled to Asia three times (Japan once, Korea twice). I did solo travel to Japan but I knew very basic Japanese and don&#x27;t know any Vietnamese.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m going to Vietnam in a month, I&#x27;m from Italy so EURO.
 I have Curve, Revolut and BBVA and none of them charge me for exchange fees or atm withdrawal abroad.
 I&#x27;ve read though that in Vietnam every time you withdraw from an ATM or pay with a card you are charged an extra ~3% fee from the Vietnamese bank. Is that so?
 What&#x27;s the most convenient option? Is exchanging EURO at the airport the cheapest option?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m from New Zealand and learned recently that the Cham people speak an Austronesian language, which is the same linguistic family as Te Reo Māori from NZ. 
 What I&#x27;ve also noticed is that Vietnamese seems to have some loan words from the Cham language, like:
 Eye - mắt - mblak (Cham). Mata (Māori) can mean face, but may sometimes refer to eye, eyebrow, or looking out. The Cham word for face is also mata.
 This - này - ne (Cham) - nei (Māori) (usually used as tēnei, but also by itself, like in ā te pō nei (this night).
 There are quite a few more that I found.
 Because of these similarities, could there be more of a Cham influence on Vietnamese than I thought? Is it common knowledge that the Cham language has influence on Vietnamese and vice versa?

                              <span>I am a textile sesign student and recently I have been making patterns based on Vietnam&#x27;s Tet Nguyen Dan and one of the prints contain the fruits present in Mam Ngu Qua. I had been using a book to figure out what all fruits can be added (as main or substitutions) in it and it mentioned figs as one of the substitution that can be added on the tray and it stuck with me and I made a design with that as well. Now I found some websites that claimed figs are not used at all and its making me nervous as I don&#x27;t have enough time to remove it from the design before I am to showcase the collection for marking. So before I chuck it out of my collection, I thought I should come here amd ask you guys. What do you think I should do?

                              <span>I have started making my own Vietnamese drip coffee at home, but I am not sure of the “proper” way to brew. Sometimes, a vacuum is formed from the heat and condensation and seals the lid shut, causing the coffee to not drip into the cup. Am I supposed to break the vacuum seal? Do I just leave it for 10-15 minutes until the temps drop and the vacuum breaks on its own? Is a vacuum seal supposed to even happen?
 Sorry, I am new to dripping my own coffee. Please don’t flame me!

The scammer told him that he needs $2000 for an operation. As kind hearted (and somehow gullible) man, my uncle sent $2000 on the spot. And he is one of the poor relatives among my family. I feel so bad for him. I feel so sorry for his family. His wife works day and night for a clothing factory with really bad conditions and he is a construction worker in Vietnam. Can someone help me and tell me how I can help him? I only have this one information of this scammers bank account.

                              <span>I am planning a trip to Hanoi for 2week trip in march. I plan to have some luxury stays and some very minimal cheap stays to get a feel of what I can bare. I am getting tired of US politics and crazy events lately. I want to learn more the resilience and beliefs of Vietnamese and maybe Buddhism. 
 Ultimately I want to see if I can be retired snowbird in Vietnam Jan-April or live in the region (Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, ect..). I am 53 and healthy and athletic. I raised two wonderful adult ladies and separating from a controlling spouse. I want to be free and take someone that we can mutually take care of each other. I want to connect with authentic people/community that support each other and live a less complicated life.
 I am a Korean migrated to US and I never felt I belonged. I look Korean but white in the inside with my upbringing. I am looking back now and want to meet people like me. Think differently, feel, love. I am looking for friends to hang out and eat and go to clubs. New connections that will pull me back to Asia and feel at home. 
 Question 1. What would be better than Hanoi for value for money compared to other Asian cities. 
 Question 2. Do you find it&#x27;s easy to make good authentic friendship with travelers and local people? Is it easy to date and any advice on best way to find activities with other singles wanting to connect in Hanoi. Connect and travel together?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;d like to learn Vietnamese but I don&#x27;t know where to start. I have no prior exposure of the language or country whatsoever so I really am clueless about Vietnamese culture. However after doing a little research I found out that people are divided on what the standard dialect of Vietnamese is. Google articles say the standard dialect is Northern Vietnamese but will also tell you that you should learn the Southern dialect instead and materials that teach you the Northern dialect I&#x27;ve noticed are kind of frowned upon. I really have no idea what these mean Which sounds stupid I know but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll take the time to learn. Does it really matter which dialect I will learn between those two? Are the differences between the two dialects really that noticeable to the point of miscommunication? I also noticed that learning Vietnamese is also not as accessible as learning other languages like Chinese or German so if anyone has/know any free resources to learn Vietnamese then I&#x27;d appreciate if you&#x27;ll share it in the comments... Thankss

I haven&#x27;t driven semi-automatic yet, but it looks easy enough to learn. I&#x27;m wondering, since the Winner has 6 gears, is it any harder? I only drive around the city and am in traffic a decent amount...I&#x27;ve heard fully automatic bikes aren&#x27;t great for busy areas. Let me know if you have any advice, xin cảm ơn. ^^

                              <span>Hi, everyone! I hope you are all doing well. 
 Me and four other family members will be travelling to Ho Chi Minh this December. May I ask which street or district is ideal to stay at for the duration of our tour? 
 Also, I would like to know some recommendations for a 3-day tour doable by people ranging from 18 to 68 years old. I hope you can help me out in this tour. Ideas about the public transportation access will also be helpful. 
 Thanks so much! Looking forward to your replies! :)

                              <span>Our family of 5 adults will be flying into TSN airport from Seoul mid-December (as part of our trip from the US). Has anyone experienced the priority immigration line and whether it is worth paying for it (we already have our e-visas)?
 It seems to me that the priority line is mainly for aircrew staff. Do these immigration line &quot;fast-track&quot; services &quot;bribe&quot; immigration officials so customers could use that line also?
 I&#x27;ve also heard that the line closest to the priority immigration line (heard towards the left) tends to be quickest. Has anyone experienced that to be true?

                              <span>Chào mọi người,
 The wife and I want to go to vũng tàu soon. I&#x27;m Người nước ngoài, and she&#x27;s originally from Vietnam but grew up abroad, where we met. We now live in Vietnam.
 She remembers Vũng tàu public beaches with food vendors, beer vendors, chair vendors, etc. I&#x27;ve been to beaches like this, and while you always need to watch yourself from getting ripped off, I enjoy having the option to buy some food and drinks from people coming up right to your spot on the beach and the variety of stuff that they might bring. She remembers it fondly too. But I&#x27;ve read that the govt has possibly restricted vendors from these beaches? Is this true? And are there no beaches that have these vendors? We&#x27;re trying to plan the trip and I can&#x27;t find any real answers can someone help me?
 Nước ngoài translation:
 Tôi (người nước ngoài) và vợ muốn đi du lịch ở vũng tàu để đi biển, đi chơi, ăn hải sản, v.v... vợ tôi nhớ vũng tàu có nhiều người bán đồ ăn, bìa, thuê ghế ở biển. Tôi đã đi biển khác mà có người bán, và tôi rất là thích Những mà, tôi mới đọc mầ chín phủ không cho phép người bán trên biển nữa. Có đúng không?.
 Sorry if that Vietnamese gives anyone heartburn. Thanks for the advice!

                              <span>Finhay is an investing app that my wife and I came across a few years back. The interest rates are about 2% higher than traditional banks. We put a fair bit of money in it, collected nice interest, and used it to pay off our mortgage. As we start building up our savings again, we are questioning whether to continue saving money in Finhay at higher interest rates (~8%) or to put it in traditional banks (~6%), which of course have risks of their own in Vietnam&#x27;s relatively wild west financial system.
 I&#x27;d love to hear any insight you all have on the safety &amp; risks of Finhay. Thanks so much!

Thứ nhất, em thấy giá cả chi phí cao so tình hình kinh tế nhà em. Thứ 2, đó là em ở lớp ko thích mấy thành phần(ích kỷ, nói xấu,...). Nên em lên đây xin ý kiến mọi người ạ. Em cảm ơn rất nhiều

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;ve been listening to a really beautiful song I came across on spotify, &quot;còn yêu em mãi&quot; by elvis phương, and I was wondering if anyone could translate it for me properly (all of the lyrics). I feel as though google translate makes it lose its essence
 Edit: I&#x27;d also love to know more about the depth of the words that had been used. So in case there is something special about the vocabulary, grammar and so on, I would absolutely appreciate some explanations. I&#x27;m ready for a vietnamese &quot;lesson&quot; :)))))

                              <span>Hello some friends and I are staying in Halong Bay in February and were wondering if anyone had any recommendations for two day overnight cruises that also visit Ninh Binh. Seems like from looking online most of those are three days but unfortunately we can’t do that. Additionally, most of our group are fluent in Vietnamese. Thank you!

                              <span>Flying into Saigon on 12/28, wondering if i should commit 5 nights there and stay for NYE or do 3 nights and fly out early on the 31st to Da Nang and just party there. Honestly with the wife so some fireworks and a nice fun vibe would be cool. Just not sure if its worth to stay 5 nights in Saigon just for NYE when the caves and mountains in the north are calling.

                              <span>Hi everyone I need to report a sexual assault that happened in tam coc a few days ago. Unfortunately, the Ninh Binh police hang up on me as they do not speak English. Is there an email address or hotline that could help me with this ? It drives me mad knowing this man is walking around without worries doing the same to other women. Also, I have videos of him running away from me, but guess those are unlikely to help unless there are cameras on the streets showing his face. Thanks for your help

The usual ones on the street cafes I believe are Robusta? Those are the ones I really like, and do it Vietnamese style, with condensed milk 😅😅😅. At the moment I use Trung Nguyen S but I was wondering if there are far better ones I could buy in Ho Chi Minh ☺️ thank you ☺️

These are gifts to family members in Hanoi. I&#x27;ve heard stories of people having to pay fines because custom officers at Noi Bai will think they&#x27;re for resale. Is that still going on or is she going to be fine?

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 I am 21F from the US and planning my first trip abroad and intend on it being to Vietnam. In school I learned a lot about Vietnamese history which caused me to want Vietnam or China as my first location and I settled on Vietnam. 
 Because it’s my first trip I want to be able to spend without much worry shopping and food wise. And be in a semi nice/clean hotel. I also intend to hire a Vietnam local to help with navigation, translation, etc. so a few questions. 
 How much should I budget for hotel? Any suggestions?
 How much should I budget for shopping?
 How much should I budget for bribes/transportation?
 I plan to travel to a popular city and more “normal” aka less touristy city if you have any suggestions. 
 I also plan on paying my guide/new friend around 7 mil vnd each week (plan to stay for 1-3) and I’m not sure if this is sufficient based on the current economy, I would pay for all food, transportation, etc while they are with me. 
 Any other travel suggestions as an early 20s female traveling alone in Vietnam is welcome and thank you in advance.

                              <span>I often hears folks on r/TrochuyenLinhTinh calls Nguyễn Phú Trọng as Trọng lú (Alzheimer Trọng basically).
 It sounds humourous to me, given that he is also quite old, and it draws similarity to Joe Biden, whom also gets called lú by Trump fans as well.
 What is the story behind the infamous name Trọng lú?

                              <span>xin phép admin cho tui đăng lại vì hồi sáng tui chưa nói rõ nên comment bị lệch hướng hết (lỗi tui lỗi tui)
 hê lô mí bồ
 tui đang cần tìm các từ đồng nghĩa hoặc cách nói khác của “(không) quan tâm”. ko phải quan tâm theo kiểu chăm sóc mà là quan tâm, để ý những điều người khác nghĩ hoặc nói
 hiện tại tui đang có những từ/cụm từ sau:
 để ý, để tâm, để bụng
 mặc kệ, để ngoài tai, kệ xác, kệ mẹ, kệ bà, kệ mợ, bơ, bơ đi mà sống…
 tui vẫn cần tìm thêm, càng dân dã hoặc càng trẻ trâu thì càng tốt. tui cần tìm nhiều và đa dạng chứ ko cần đúng ngữ cảnh nên có từ nào mí bồ cứ liệt kê hết giùm tui nha
 chỉ có là ko được trộn tiếng Anh nên là mấy cái như đ&#x27; care hay đếch care là hong được. với là tui cần tìm cách nói khác của từ (không) quan tâm chứ ko phải câu thoại thể hiện thái độ không quan tâm nên là cũng ko phải kiểu “nhún vai và nói ’tưởng bố mày quan tâm à?’“
 thanks mí bồ

                              <span>Lần đầu viết bài, văn có lủng củng không hay thì mọi người thông cảm giúp mình nhé. Thật lòng không biết bắt đầu câu chuyện thế nào. Mình năm nay 19 tuổi, sống ở Ninh Bình. Đáng ra giờ này mình đang năm 2 đại học, tuy nhiên vì 1 số biến cố mà mình vẫn đang ở nhà nuôi mộng đại học. Và quãng thời gian này mình đang cảm thấy rất tuyệt vọng, mình có những kế hoạch, và mình sợ nó sẽ mãi không thành hiện thực. Để tập trung vào chuyện học hành thì mình đã bỏ hoàn toàn fb, zalo và các bạn của mình thì đang học đại học. Vì thế nên mình không còn ai để nói chuyện cả, và việc không giao tiếp với ai ngoài gia đình thực sự làm mình suy sụp. 1 số lúc thôi, nhưng lúc nó xảy ra mình không biết ứng phó thế nào. Rất căng thẳng, mình cảm thấy bản thân vô dụng, là 1 thằng ăn bám. Suy nghĩ của mình rất rối. Mình cần người để nói chuyện, tâm sự. Tuy nhiên mình lại nghĩ rằng làm thế để làm gì? Cũng không đạt tác dụng gì cả. Làm thế chẳng khác nào thừa nhận rằng bản thân yếu đuối, phụ thuộc vào người khác. Nó đến tự nhiên và cũng rời đi rất tự nhiên. Giờ tự nhiên mình thấy bình thường rồi. Chắc chỉ đơn giản viết ra suy nghĩ của bản thân là đỡ. Sao cần phải nhờ người khác khi tự giải quyết được nhỉ. Good luck brothers. 
 Tuy nhiên ai có cách hay thì cho vào đây nhé, mình sẽ rất biết ơn.

                              <span>Been here for a a week now and as a solo traveller, Ive been enjoying the solo experience, I often go to eat alone, do activities alone and drink at bar and all sorts of stuff but I never feel lonely at all no ! 
 Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there were moments were I want to share moments but it makes me appreciate humanity and people a lot more. 
 A lot of travellers and locals often become surprised at the fact that I just do things independently and tell me things like &quot; I&#x27;m too scared to be alone&quot; or &quot; Aren&#x27;t you scared?&quot; Or &quot; Where&#x27;s your boyfriend?&quot;. 
 Scared of what ? Scared of not being able to be comfortable in my own skin? I&#x27;d be more afraid of that tbh! 
 The reason why I never feel truly alone or lonely is being I&#x27;m at a state of being where I feel content in the present moment, I want to soak it all up and enjoy the time I have here, I talk to people if I want to connect but I also have this freedom to also experience my inner world with the world outside of me and for the time I have here I want to be able to experience that.
 So for another question, what do the introverts or freespirits do here as well in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hey all, just came back from a 2 week trip in VN and it was amazing. I had a few questions lingering from the trip on my mind, which I wanted to just hear discussion on.
 1) As title states, why is PQ so empty? It reminds me of a nicer Cancun/Cabo and the people are amazing. For some reason there was ZERO people at Grand World when we visited during the day and then it wasn&#x27;t even that busy at night either. The shops seemed fake but they actually had workers when we went in so I&#x27;m still confused.
 2) Is tourism down in VN in general this year? Why is that? A lot of the Grab drivers were letting us hire them for the full day and we would just have to pay the Grab rates(or less) and they didn&#x27;t charge at all for waiting time... (for example if we went to Grand World for 5-6 hours, he would just charge us for the ride there and back)

 tui đang cần tìm cách nói khác của “(không) quan tâm”. ko phải quan tâm theo kiểu chăm sóc mà là quan tâm, để ý những điều người khác nghĩ hoặc nói
 hiện tại tui đang có những cách nói sau:
 để ý, để tâm, để bụng
 mặc kệ, để ngoài tai, kệ xác, kệ mẹ, kệ bà, kệ mợ
 tui vẫn cần tìm thêm, càng dân dã hoặc càng trẻ trâu thì càng tốt. mí bồ biết cách nói nào nữa thì kể giùm tui nha. thanks mí bồ

                              <span>Hi all.
 My family and I are planning to visit Phu Quoc for a few days and I&#x27;m looking for the best transportation option.
 The problem is that motorbikes are not an option for 3 out of 4 of us for various reasons (older age, bad eyesight, and no driver&#x27;s license). From what I&#x27;ve gathered, grab/other taxi services aren&#x27;t that common around the island, and renting a car is impossible. But we&#x27;d still like to explore and move around and I&#x27;m getting a bit discouraged by the research I&#x27;ve done so far.
 Is there an option I haven&#x27;t considered yet? Or, maybe my research is wrong? What would be the best transport option for the 4 of us around the island?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Recently left Vietnam after back packing through it for 90 days; missing it already. In my last few days in Hanoi before flying out I redownloaded Pokemon Go just to see what&#x27;s up, and on my last day there I caught a Beldum with perfect IVs.
 Now, I learned a little Vietnamese (mostly so I could order food in a restaurant from a Vietnamese menu) but I don&#x27;t exactly have a wide vocabulary. I wanted to nickname that Beldum something Vietnamese and was wondering, for any pokemon fans here, if you have any good ideas for what you might nickname a Metagross.
 Otherwise I&#x27;m gonna be stuck calling the thing &quot;Bánh mì&quot;, and it deserves better.

 September 2023, I spent the entire month in Vietnam. I entered Vietnam from USA on an Evisa that let me stay until December 2023. First I stayed with my family in HCM then spent the rest of the time solo traveling to central and the north. Towards the end of the month I wanted to go Thailand. This is where I messed up.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning a one-week trip to Hanoi in mid-January next year with my parents, who are in their 70s. The tentative plan includes a 2-night stay in Hanoi, followed by a 3-day 2-night cruise at Halong Bay. 
 Any suggestions for other tours or trips outside Hanoi? My parents are healthy but can&#x27;t walk or climb steps for extended periods. We&#x27;re more inclined towards natural scenaries and experiencing local culture than shopping.

I am currently in the US, and it is difficult to find physical copies of Vietnamese books, and I am trying to learn Vietnamese. I would be open to any suggested reading if someone has a better book to read.

I take Remeron and Doxepin and going off those for any length of time is not an option. Are there any exceptions to this rule?

                              <span>We are heading to Ho Chi Minh from Canada (2hr layover in Narita) on Dec 17 and flying from Hanoi to Tokyo on Dec 27. We will travel from HCM to Hanoi by plane and train. 
 We will have lots of luggage we need in Japan but don’t want to carry when traveling in Vietnam. What should we do? Japan Airlines said we can’t take our suitcases and send to our Japan address during our layover. I called our hotel in Hanoi and asked if we could courier our luggage to their hotel for 9 days and they said no. Thoughts?

                              <span>Our son recently became friends with a Vietnamese boy in his class. We love him and his family, but his parents do not speak English (despite having lived in the US for several years). 
 Last week, our son had a birthday party and as a gift, they gave him a credit/debit card worth $100. We were flabbergasted. They do not seem like an overtly wealthy family: middle class house, etc. 
 We don&#x27;t know what to do. We are uncomfortable with this gift, but unable to discuss it with them. Of course we would be very tactful if we could, just explaining that it is not the norm in this culture to give such an exorbitant gift. Since they do not speak English after living here for years, we thought perhaps they work in fields where they don&#x27;t need to, and are thus sort of encapsulated in a cultural bubble? 
 Thoughts on this, and how we should approach it? 
 (Also: when they came to drop off/pick up their son from our house, they refused to come inside. Not even into the entryway. And it was cold outside, so I was standing there with the door open while we waited for the kids to come downstairs. I invited them several times. The only thing I can remotely think of is that we have cats, and maybe they&#x27;re allergic?)

                              <span>My spouse has interviewed and been offered a job in HCMC. We were originally thinking 2 years would be the max, and then extend if we like it or move on if we didn’t. The job offer that was received was 3 years. The pay and benefits are good, but he wouldn’t get 2 days off in a row which puts a damper on traveling to other cities to explore. Just wondering what others thoughts are on living in HCMC for an extra year. Would you? Why or why not?

Sorry, i dont have accents on my keyboard. 
 Are any of these correct?

                              <span>I never had real Vietnamese food before, but I found a small restaurant in my neighborhood recently and now it has become my favorite! I usually don&#x27;t eat soups because I find them boring, like the classic veggie or chicken soup that almost everyone makes, or tomato soup, potato soup and so on. They&#x27;re ok, kinda bland sometimes, but nothing special to me. 
 But the first time I tried Pho Bo, it just blew me away, the combination of flavors is just spectacular. Now whenever I go to this restaurant, I always start with a Pho Bo. Then I continue with other stuff like Bahn Mi, Bún chả and others that I forgot their name and struggle to pronounce them, but I&#x27;m trying to learn. I think it&#x27;s good to learn their real names, it&#x27;s a sign of respect and appreciation. 
 I also like that they&#x27;re playing traditional Vietnamese music on speakers, I find it very relaxing. And the people there are also very friendly and hospitable, which makes the whole experience so much better.
 A huge thank you for all the food you bring to the world!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for a month now. Before, I had the impression that it isn&#x27;t really an expensive country.
 I checked per capita income, it isn&#x27;t much. 
 But everyone here has some expensive things that just don&#x27;t make sense. 
 Everyone seems to have iPhone, that too - pro models. Many people here drive expensive cars. Even the grab cabs are relatively good cars.
 But accomodation, hotel stays aren&#x27;t expensive. Food is fair priced.
 So it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. - how much people earn here, on an average? - if people aren&#x27;t earning much, how are they able to afford such expensive things? - what is normal mentality people have regarding finances and savings. Do they spend all they earn? - what is mentality on owning things? Why does everything have extensive phones and cars here?

                              <span>I think some of this explains a lot of the recent posts….
 Not that it matters so much, but I’ve lived in Vietnam the past 20 years, can speak the language, etc. I’m not asking for an appeal to authority, but I have, in my view, earned the right to judge. 
 In terms of the most important parts of culture, Vietnam is a toxic mess that needs to grow up and figure itself out. Now let me qualify that. 
 When you get to know Vietnamese people, they are great. Some of my best friends are Vietnamese. People I would trust with my kids. They’re kind, gentle, caring, and generous. But this is a one-on-one thing. 
 Then there’s the public culture. When the cloak of anonymity drops and no one knows you, people are often vile and selfish. The noise, the littering, the way people drive, elevators, queui…</span>

                              <span>I’ve read a couple of posts/ comments on this sub about experiences of black people in Vietnam. One said that in Vietnam black people are thought to be, aggressive or dirty or unlucky and should expect racism, and not be treated like other tourists, i.e. in a welcoming way. I realise no country is free of racism (some are worse than others) but is it likely to be so apparent that it negatively impacts my experience of Vietnam? If so I would like some insight so I know what to expect.
 I’ve travelled to a handful countries in SE Asia most have friendly locals and I didn’t feel any different to any other travellers. Except in two-ish cases. One country was memorable for people handing me babies to take photos and basically being in a zoo like situation and in another I experienced constant racism, being called a ghost people whispering behind your back, not being served like other people in restaurants etc. The only place I was treated well in that country, was the hotel I stayed at. I plan on going back to the first country because as tiring as that became, after the novelty of being an instant celebrity wore off, the people were not inherently racist just not exposed and they were actually lovely people. The second I will avoid for as long as I can.
 I plan on making the most of this trip either way because I like to experience new places but some insight would be helpful so I can be mentally prepared. It’s a short trip so I’ll only be going to HCMC and Nha Trang. Apart from a few trips to areas near these places, I won’t be venturing anywhere else.

                              <span>So I know this sounds like a stupid question and it might be ahaha but I&#x27;m scottish and I&#x27;ve been away from home for awhile now and I always crave haggis. I&#x27;m literally about to get on a bus to Vietnam tonight and I&#x27;ve found haggis in a shop in Cambodia. I called my dad to tell him about it and he told me it&#x27;s been banned in other countries before?? I&#x27;ve been wanting haggis for so long I think I&#x27;ll cry if I can&#x27;t take it into Vietnam with me lol. I can&#x27;t find anything about it online so I&#x27;m praying someone here can tell me ahaha I know this is silly

 We can draw many parallels.

                              <span>Hey so have many of you guys run into these fake Facebook profiles of attractive Vietnamese women that add you as friends? Then they continue to get to know you and follow up advertising about teaching you crypto and are super pushy about it. I am always suspicious the moment they talk to me but let it play out. I never let it get past that part and just tell them to fuck off. However, I am curious where are they going with those scam? They waste so much time and energy and some of them straight up forget their humanity for the sake of trying to get some easy bucks. They also always pretend to be from Cali but I suspect they are from our homeland because I can’t imagine living in the US and using these dirty tactics to make a living. It is so shameful and embarrassing.

                              <span>Hi there everyone,
 I’ll be visiting Hanoi, VN next week, and I’m so excited to explore the city.
 Where can I score good thrift clothes or local clothing brands in Hanoi?
 Where can I find free art galleries in Hanoi?
 Where can we have an affordable yet fancy dinner in Hanoi?
 Where can we find a friendly and nice straight or gay bars/clubs in Hanoi?
 Thank you so much! 🫶🏻🇻🇳

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just booked a room in TPHCM/Q5, and I received a free shuttle from Tân Sơn Nhất to my hotel.
 This was offered by booking.com, not the hotel.
 Do you have any good/bad experience with this &quot;E-Life Limo&quot; service?
 I&#x27;m afraid of scammers that will ask for more money even if booking.com says it&#x27;s free for me.
 I have Grab App and a SIM, so I can easily book a Grab if needed.

                              <span>Hi Guys, This is our 1st international trip after marriage on our 1st anniversary. I have been to Thailand before but since my wife wanted the feel of it, I have included a week. Need suggestions if thats a good idea. Vietnam itinerary- Land in Hanoi on 12th Jan. 3 nights Hanoi/Ha Long and nearby 1 night in train/bus to Da Nang 2 nights in Da Nang 1 night in Hoi An or vice versa 1 night in train/bus to HCMC 2 nights in HCMC
 On 22nd Jan, flight from HCMC to Chiang Mai.
 2nights in Chiang Mai 1 night travel to BKK BKK to Phuket flight 2 nights in Phuket/Krabi Phuket to BKK flight 2 nights in BKK/Pattaya On 29th Jan, Monday, back to India.
 Thailand itinerary is not finalised yet just a rough thought on the above as on my previous trip I have already covered BKK, Pattaya, Phuket, Koh Samui and the full moon party. This trip was before Thailand legalised weed. I am also considering Thailand this time as both of us want to experience the weed culture now along with the new places like Chiang Mai, Krabi etc. Currently i have only booked the departure to Hanoi on 12th Jan, planning to book HCMC- Chiang Mai and BKK to delhi back, by tomorrow. Please help guide if I am doing the right thing.

 31 of us coming to Nha Trang next weekend, on a batchelor party.
 We have booked our venues, but are looking for some different / weird activities we can do to embarrass the groom to be, that would be ok in a restaurant. We dont want anything sexual.
 Any help would be appreciated !

                              <span>I opened a Vietnamese cafe in Philadelphia United States. We sell grilled pork skewers, beef skewers, shrimp skewers, fried rice, shrimp fried rice, seafood fried rice, chicken wings, fish wings, garlic wings, spring rolls. Many of the Vietnamese restaurants here sell phở, mì quảng, bún bò huế and soups. We want to sell food the other restaurants don’t sell. What are some ideas or recipes we can offer that will sell well and be popular? We have a small kitchen space so it’s difficult to offer a lot of different options at the same time. 
 Tôi mở một quán cà phê Việt Nam ở Philadelphia Hoa Kỳ. Chúng tôi bán xiên que nướng, xiên bò, xiên tôm, cơm chiên, cơm chiên tôm, cơm chiên hải sản, cánh gà, cánh cá, cánh tỏi, chả giò. Nhiều nhà hàng Việt Nam ở đây bán phở, mì quảng, bún bò huế và các món súp. Chúng tôi muốn bán đồ ăn mà các nhà hàng khác không bán. Một số ý tưởng hoặc công thức nấu ăn nào chúng tôi có thể đưa ra sẽ bán chạy và được ưa chuộng? Chúng tôi có không gian bếp nhỏ nên khó có thể đưa ra nhiều lựa chọn khác nhau cùng lúc.

                              <span>We bought Viettel sim cards at the airport, assuming that any booths inside the airport were official stores. Our sim cards were simultaneously deactivated after 36 hours. We went to the official Viettel store in Hoi An, and she looked up the sim cards. She said that they were very old and that they were not registered on their network anymore. She also told us to only buy from an official Viettel store, and said that there are no official Viettel stores at Da Nang airport. We had to buy new sim cards (we paid 170k for 2 gigs a day for a month - less than the 240k we paid at the airport). Thankfully we paid with a credit card so we can dispute the charge.

                              <span>Husband and I have just finished visiting the northern region of Vietnam, mainly Hanoi, Cat Ba and Ninh Binh. We are just blown away by this beautiful country and it’s people.
 There’s just so much to see and do in this beautiful country. Only being here for a few days we were so sad to leave but have so much appreciation for the hustle and bustle life of busy cities like Hanoi, as well as the calm and quiet lifestyle of those in Cat Ba.
 The variety of food options available here makes me so embarrassed as a westerner who had only heard about Pho. My favourite meal was when I had a local home cooked meal prepared by the wife of the caption who was taking us on a tour on Ha long bay. 
 Lastly, the people. I have never met such wonderful, accommodating and most admirably hard working individuals in any other place in the world. Some people on this sub say that people nag tourists to buy stuff, but I see that as them working hard to earn their keep. I just feel so much respect and admiration and ashamed at the times I have felt lazy to do my privileged job. 
 So grateful to have had this travelling experience in this beautiful country and can’t wait to be back.

                              <span>You know those donut ladies that are all around Hanoi pushing a baby carriage filled with 3 day old donut holes?
 I&#x27;m wondering - where do they actually get all of the donuts? Like - what&#x27;s the source? 
 The ones they try to sell / force onto me are always so old and stale, but I have a feeling that I&#x27;d really like the fresh ones, if I could find any. 
 Anyone know where they come from? Thanks! :)

 It will be two adults and two teenage boys? We love good food, nice hotels, and a little tourist stuff but not too much!

                              <span>Just spent my evening at bui vien and absolutely heart breaking to see so many young children being sent out to sell items/blowing fire/begging. Being dragged around by parent or young siblings absolutely tired unable to keep eyes open. We even saw an infant no older that a month old being taken around the loud clubs with her begging mother. WHY is there not a ban in place for children to be on this PARTY street late in the evening?? Why are the vietnam govt allowing these children to be used in this way. I don’t know how people can enjoy there evening seeing the sad reality for these children. My heart breaks for them all.
 EDIT 
 i believe some people have taken this post in the wrong way. What I am wondering is if these children are being used by gangs etc why does the gov not try and minimise children being used in this way in main tourist areas etc

                              <span>I know that cosmetic and self care is something ordinary in Vietnam. I’ve always been curious and wanted to do bloodwork and test my genetics to see what my body needs, is over sufficient or deficient, likelihood of baldness etc. Have anyone done this before and where can this be done if possible.

                              <span>I’m not sure my English is correct. How much should women often “challenge” their Vietnamese partners for wedding?
 Introduction of myself: I am Chinese girl living in Hanoi. My sister and brother-in-law moved their factory here in 2018. I saw them having a good life here . They can afford having kids which is nightmare in China nowadays. So I decided to move and work here. I’m 24 years old, and it’s time to think about serious traditional relationship. My brother in law introduced me his Vietnamese customer. He’s a great and humorous guy. He’s running 3 clothes stores and online shops. We’re having good relationship and I think about marriage. In China, women’s families often expect wedding presents as cash from men. In my home province in China, it’s often 100000 cny (340 million vnd). I don’t expect the same amount in Vietnam. May be our tradition can be different. I’m curious how much I should expect from my future Vietnamese husband.
 I’m ready for marriage life here. My personal finance is good. And I improved my Vietnamese a lot. I can sing See Tinh well 😁. It’s very easy for Chinese to pronounce Vietnamese words.

 What is the process to get an apostille stamp for my Vietnamese document in Vietnam?

                              <span>Hi! I might get an offer soon to relocate in vietnam. I wanted to know how much should I allocate for rent in HCM area? Anyone can suggest a good but safe neighborhood for 2 females. I have been to HCM many times but not really familiar in terms of the rent since we always booked hotels. All suggestions Much appreciated Thank you!

                              <span>Hi I just found this forum and I&#x27;m kind of typing this in a rush because I&#x27;m pretty freaked out at the moment.
 I&#x27;ve been working as an English teacher in Vietnam for the past (almost) 2 months.
 My boss showed me a contract at the beginning but I never actually signed anything. I am trying to look for new work because she &#x27;fired&#x27; me like a month ago?? But I&#x27;ve still been working for her??
 Basically, she told me at first that the company can&#x27;t keep me because they can&#x27;t afford teachers and I&#x27;m not good enough. But then she said I could stay at the accommodation while I find new work.
 Then when a new company showed interest, she told me I can&#x27;t change over because I&#x27;ll get the company in trouble? She explained that she has to cancel my visa first. The agent says I need a letter from my bo…</span>

                              <span>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be any escaping the huge gangs of Chinese in danang. 
 Twice today, once in a beautifully quiet pho restaurant, sat down, then suddenly a huge coach outside and in they flocked accompanied with a shouting tour guide armed with a flag, table barged into, bag on the floor knocked over, coughing whilst walking past no hand over mouth, loud noise for the next miserable 20 minutes. Then later on the beach, all calm, and along come a huge flock of about 40 of them, walking literally right next to me even though there&#x27;s so much space, yelling at each other. Wtf is going on?! Lol. Can Chinese people travel alone or in couples or is it a government rule by the ccp that they must travel in large flocks of minimum 50 and cause maximum impact wherever they go... Just curious.... Don&#x27;t see any other nationalities travelling like this....

                              <span>I just came from Tokyo where I would sing karaoke and have a great time. It was fun. It was lovely. People bonding over music and enjoy life in karaoke bars/rooms in noisy areas like Kabukicho, far from residental areas.
 Just came back to Vietnam, a country that is the complete opposite of Japan in every way imaginable and I swear it sounds like someone is running a duck over with a lawnmower every time they pick up a microphone. I&#x27;m no Freddie Mercury by any means, but it has to be something in the water here making people tone-deaf.
 I just got to my girlfriend&#x27;s house, she has been really sick for a week, and despite knowing that the neighbors have been playing karaoke nonstop. Extremely selfish? Yes. But, I&#x27;m currently listening to what sounds like a roadkill dying and I want to stab my eardrums out with chopsticks.
 How is this legal? In every other place I&#x27;ve ever lived, the police would shut this tragedy of a performance down asap. Is it the way the language sounds or are people supposed to sound like they&#x27;re drowning when they sing? Can we get a petition going to forever ban karaoke machines within a 4km radius of any city?

 It feels uncomfortable to me and it looks unprofessional, but I&#x27;ve never complained about it. Should I neck massage my subordinates to fit in with the culture? lol I wonder how wives feel about this.

                              <span>What a waste of money. I have BAC debit card and withdraw money from VPBank (blue logo), the one that do not have 50,000vnd fees. First, American Bank took $5 for each transaction + 3% and I believe there was also not the best convert rate. 
 What a waste. 
 VPBank was only gave option to withdraw 2,000,000 vnd at once. Tried to change for 5,000,000, withdraw,-- didn&#x27;t worked.

                              <span>Hello Friends,
 My dad is currently very sick with terminal cancer and lives with me in Canada outside of Vietnam. He has a Sacombank bank account with a decent amount of money in it, but it’s “locked in” as it was an interest generating account. 
 Due to his illness, he will not be able to travel back to Vietnam to do any banking as he’s very sick. Is there anything we can do to unlock the account so he can move funds to our country (Canada)? He’s under the belief the banks need him physically there but he’s in nope shape to travel.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am travelling to Vietnam for 5 days in the last week of January. We are group of 3/4 people and have short listed Ninh Binh and Hanoi as places to visit. We are landing in Hanoi, that’s why. Haven’t booked the tickets yet. 
 So, do you all think it’s wise to cover these two places in 5 days? We want to stay for at least 2 days in Ninh Binh as well not just one day tour there. 
 Would really appreciate your guidance on what places we should must go considering the short span of time in both cities. 
 Is it a wise decision to cover both places or should we stick to one place only? 
 Thanks for you help and suggestions in advance!

                              <span>Please recommend tours from Hanoi to Halong Bay and back. I want something cozy, not over crowded, could include some activities as cooking Vietnamese food, kayaking. I want to experience this place without chaotic environment.

I&#x27;m sort of dumb so not super lyric heavy would be the best. A point in the right direction would be great. Thanks!

 I’m looking to go from Hanoi to Vientiane in around a week with a few friends. I’ve seen some flights but they’re quite expensive. 
 Is there a sleeper bus available or no? I can’t seem to find much online. Would appreciate any help :)

Now I&#x27;m home with tons of souvenirs, one of them is a game (not sure) called Choi Chan. But I cannot find a clear explanation of the game on the internet, can someone help me on my quest? The image shows small little vertical boxes. 1 game 1 box. (I&#x27;ve bought multiple for my friends)

                              <span>I expected people to do research to know what to expect and today alone theres 2 posts about scam taxis in TSN. I get it, its a mess of an airport. Sometimes its a maze just to navigate so ill try to make it easier. I assume u have downloaded grab before the trip to SEA, and u can pay in cash.
 If u dont have any data, it is possible to ask your hotel to arrange transportation. Usually higher end places can do this. Somebody will hold a sign with your name at the arrival gate. Airport wifi kinda wacky sometimes
 If u arrive from international airport, once ur out of the airport, go across the street to the parking lot. There are prearranged Grab vehicles spots where they can pick u up. Book them and head there asap
 If u arrive from domestic, its a lil annoying but doable. Leave the domestic terminal and head to the building across, this is the parking building.
 parking building
 Head straight pass all the shophouses and little kiosks to the parking lot looking area
 ​
 Grab pick up area
 Grab&#x27;s designated pickup area is on lane D1, from pillar a5 to l5. Book em and wait for em here.
 Do:
 - Turn on location on grab so the grab driver know where u are
 - Ignore all the trip or taxi sellers on the way
 - Keep an eye on exact pickup location. Grab gives u a range of pillar (ie d5 to j5). Stay at the right place so the driver can pick u up on time. They only have about 3 minutes
 - Check if its the right plate number, cant even tell u how many people forgot bout this
 DONT:
 - Take any taxis other than Vinasun or Mai Linh. Even for these 2 brands they tend to send &quot;VIP&quot; taxis that charge u at higher rate
 - Spend time listen to anyone dissuate u from taking ur booked ride for &quot;cheaper&quot;. Tell em u had a ride and move pass em
 - Let ANYONE even touch ur wallet. Like tf??
 Airports are hotspots for scams, its like this for any country. Its the same shit outside of Charles de Gaulle or Beijing. Stay vigilant and enjoy ur trip

                              <span>My girlfriend just got bitten by a adolescent dog when we entered a restaurant. There were two dogs that were playing and one of them came up to us and started nipping at our legs, it bit my girlfriend and pierced the skin.
 The dog seemed alright, I think it was just being playful and saying hello in an untrained way but my gf is pretty worried that theres a chance she&#x27;s going to get rabies and die. We&#x27;ve had the course of rabies injections before coming to Vietnam but it&#x27;s my understanding that this doesn&#x27;t give you full protection and the ability to ignore dog bites.
 We left the restaurant before being able to ask if the guys dog normally does this
 What do you guys think?
 We&#x27;ve just called the dog owner and he said the the dog has had a rabies vaccine
 Edit: Have gone to the hospital to have shots

                              <span>Hey just wanna share my top 2 favorite biscuits from Vietnam so far. These 2 punch above their weight class.
 Discovered Marie Gold this year. My god...Yummy buttery unassuming biscuits thins.
 Discovered coffeejoy last year. Is a thins too, but coffee flavored. One of those biscuits you just eat non stop cos is just flavor, and munchiness but doesn&#x27;t fill the stomach.
 Any one have any other recommendations?

Bribed at the airport (Was told I brought too many bottles of medicine and was asked to give them $30 or have all the medicine confiscated)
 
Elderly cutting people in line whenever they see an opportunity and just people cutting in general
 
Pushing and shoving when waiting in line and no idea of people’s boundaries.
 
Fake pricing and trying to rip off people in general (rampant across Vietnam and in almost all market except the mall)
 
Trash everywhere
 
Lack of Public Utilities
 
Traffic is so chaotic and unsafe (Witness a deadly accident and a death of a motorcyclist in the three weeks that I’ve visited here)

                              <span>Looking for advice on whether to cancel my trip to central Vietnam. I’m visiting Hue/ Da Nang/ Hoi An in roughly 3 weeks. Will the flooding clear up and tourist sites reopen by then? Or if we should stay away, where in Vietnam would you recommend visiting instead?

                              <span>Vietnam/ho chi minh government is not doing anything to maintain a good image of vietnam. Directly outside the airport, car flagging area, full of scammer trying desperately to take all your money out of the pocket.
 The first step stepping out of ho chi minh, the best economic city of vietnam, of its airport, the whole country&#x27;s image is severely damaged. Totally no police patrolling and ensuring any passengers safety.
 I believe there are alot of good people in vietnam too, but the lack of law and safety is really bad, allowing scammer to roam freely.

                              <span>Welcome comments from Vietnamese and western audiences, and would appreciate if you can identify your background.
 I am from China and watched it last week in Australia. Generally I enjoyed the show. The choreography, stage design, acting are all fantastic. There were some really impressive scenes to look at which are more powerful than a modern action movie could do. 
 The downside is that I did feel the extent of stereotype on Vietnamese/Communist characters is a bit glaring. I can understand it was written by French men during the cold war so we shouldn&#x27;t be too harsh. I&#x27;m wondering how everyone here thinks about it.

I left a credit card active, hoping they don’t use it when they try the others. So I can at least use my phone with ereaders.
 I have until the 29th before me evisa expires. I’m going to the embassy tomorrow. How much does a new passport cost? Can it be paid for with a credit card on an ereader? Banks are Wellsfargo and Chase. How quickly can banks usually get out a new card? I used my card on Grab to order a few meals and some water. I have 20,000 in dong.
 A total headache, my god. 😆 Any informed advice would be most appreciated!

                              <span>been in hanoi 7 days now, super surprised about how eager everyone seems to be to put tourists on motorbikes. feels like there’s a conspiracy to keep the hanoibus lines secret. they’re cheap and about as reliable as your average US urban bus. why aren’t they more often suggested? is it because Vietnamese people don’t want to share their public transport with tourists/foreigners? yes they’re slow, yes you detour, maybe these are good things that some tourists might actually want?
 anyway. after some stumbling about i finally figured out that if you put “xe 
” into google it’s pretty easy to find the regional bus routes, too, which i assume (perhaps foolishly?) won’t be much worse. 
 but here’s the thing. i sorta want to relive some version of my experience from 20 years ago on Java riding the indonesian version of “Xe khách dù” using only speaking knowledge of numbers, and before google. the only guide i found suggested they’d be impossible for foreigners to navigate, which seems ??? . uncomfortable, sure. absolutely no equivalent to anything “back home” in europe - 100%, correct. but “impossible?” really?
 we’re trying a regional bus tomorrow to one of the “craft villages” that all the guides say you should hire a taxi to get to (??). if that works then i think i would like to give a “Xe khách dù” a shot. 
 is this a terrible idea? will my presence on one will cause more upset or offence than curiosity or humour (including humour at my expense, “look at the stupid foreigner” kinda thing)?

                              <span>A couple years ago, there was discussion within the party to split into two factions that would still adhere to marxism and socialism but with different presidential and prime minister candidates for elections. Do you this happening in the forseeable future?

                              <span>Long story short my brother from VN is visiting us in Australia atm and I&#x27;m noticing he&#x27;s quite a heavy drinker (4-6+ drinks per day) and by our standards that&#x27;s alcoholism.
 Obviously because he&#x27;s on holidays I don&#x27;t want to ruin his fun but at the same time I don&#x27;t want to contribute to the problem (both morally and money wise) but I&#x27;m curious as to whether alcoholism is seen as a &#x27;problem&#x27; in Vietnam? 
 I know the males in vietnam are very keen on nhau but I&#x27;m not sure if social attitudes see it as a problem. My wife is Fiji-Indian and she says in their culture its completely normal to have 5-6 beers a day, but this doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a problem. 
 Just wanted a different perspective to see how I can address this issue.

                              <span>hi y&#x27;all. 
 the weather in saigon is extremely humid and muggy, especially in the morning, hence i tend to wear shorts (gym shorts and short jeans) whenever going out. but i have noticed there are places/situations that wearing shorts might be inappropriate. so far, the situations i have been through myself include visiting temples, going to government offices, and attending a funeral. are there any other places that i should pay more attention? i am male btw. 
 thanks every in advance for enlightening me!!

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m heading to Danang this December and hoping to try paragliding while I&#x27;m there. Can anyone suggest the best spots for paragliding that won&#x27;t break the bank? The prices I&#x27;ve seen online are crazy – nearly $100 for one person! I&#x27;m sure the locals might have some better insights. It&#x27;s more expensive than the 5-star hotel I&#x27;m staying at, which is pretty amusing! 😄
 Also, besides paragliding, I&#x27;d love recommendations for other fun activities in the area. Any local favorites or must-do experiences? Thanks a bunch!
 Edited: Moreover, Is this national park worth going with a tour guide or DIY should be fine? https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/11139-trekking-bach-ma-national-park-day-tour-hue/

 Secondly: we were told it can&#x27;t be done. We have no international driver&#x27;s license. We were told nobody would rent to Americans. We were told laws were strict due to recent accidents and not to bother unless we did it via a group.
 For us - this all proved to be wrong. And because of these misperceptions - we didn&#x27;t encounter a single American on our route (plenty of French/Chinese/Japanese/British/Australian/German people, though).
 We didn&#x27;t want to be beholden to a group tour so we knew we were taking a risk - but it turned out to be not-s…</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m an Australian woman who will be travelling to Hoi An at the end of the year and would like recommendations for a tailor.
 The problem is that I am very short (160cm), very fat (130kg) and want to buy men&#x27;s business shirts and maybe a men&#x27;s suit.
 Are there any tailors who are used to dealing with short, fat tourists?

Looking to fly with them as I read that VietJet and Bamboo are rubbish. Travel for late March/early April 2024. TIA. 🙏🏼

                              <span>I was reading a book recently that claimed Pol Pot planned to invade South Vietnam, and essentially try to take Saigon before the North Vietnamese forces arrived and restore the Mekong to Cambodia, which nationalists there historically claim. It didn&#x27;t happen because of how unexpectedly quickly the RVN forces fell to the North, although Cambodian forces did briefly take Phu Quoc after the fall of Saigon before being expelled. And then ultimately crushed in 1978 when the battle-hardened Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia. 
 It got me thinking about what would have happened if he had invaded the much weaker South Vietnam, assuming it hadn&#x27;t collapsed so quickly. Could he have pushed through to Saigon? Would China, who preferred to have Vietnam divided, have provided more support? Any good sources or alternate history places to read more?

                              <span>We visited several parts of Vietnam from South to North but nowhere we saw a rich population of birds. Especially in the more tropical south I would have expected much more. Also insects - not much. Is there a reason or am I just wrong with my observation?

                              <span>Long story: my mom (Viet Kieu with no Vietnamese CCCD) gave my grandmother money to buy land and a house. So we spent monies on buying that land and built a house. 
 My grandmother died, then transferred that land title to my Aunt. Now that my mom retired to Vietnam, she has CCCD and Ho Khau. 
 We asked Aunt say to transfer land back to my mom&#x27;s name, she refused. She gave a lame excuse like &quot;Oh, when I die, I will put you on the will paper, transferring the land to you. Don&#x27;t worry nobody will live in your house&quot;. (She has the red book, it means she could easily sell the land and house right?) 
 My aunt is a 60 year old, childless, never married woman.
 I have a video recording of the aunt admitting that my grandma gifting the land to my mom, and the whole village (it&#x27;s small) knows that we bought the land and house 15 years ago. I have many aunts and uncles and nighebours that can be the witness, if that means anything in court.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Just took a trip to Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. One thing I noticed, particularly in shops, cafes and restaurants is that while in the other countries (even hyper expensive Singapore), buildings were usually an arctic blast the moment you walk in, a lot of places in Vietnam often only have 1 AC unit running, AC set to a high temperature or areas of the premises partitioned off for &quot;cleaning&quot;.
 I also noticed they usually just open the windows in the morning in spite of the noise, heat and pollution, waiting till the heat was unbearable before finally shutting the windows and turning the AC on and would sometimes turn off the AC 30 minutes or more before closing time. Is it really that expensive to run AC in Vietnam? . . Disclaimer - before the &quot;all police&quot; chime in, obviously not all Vietnamese businesses are like this and I&#x27;m sure they do this in other countries too but that besides the point.

                              <span>I saw a number recently that only 5% of international tourists revisit Vietnam. So I&#x27;m doing a survey polling international visitors to analyze the reasons here: https://forms.gle/kTGkPDg5zNt2CkUC9
 It only takes 5 minutes to complete and I would love to hear some perspectives on this issue, as that number is really low compared to countries like Thailand or Indonesia.

                              <span>Hello everyone, How is life like in Ben Tre Vietnam? I have this job offer at a kindergarten which should keep me busy during the day for the most part, so I basically have the evenings and the weekend for myself. Is there much to do there? How long does it take to get to HCMC if I want to spend the weekend there, I am also big into swimming, are there any swimming pools that you can subscribe to? Food options etc. I applied your feedback.

                              <span>hi! anyone know if there’s much of a difference between booking day tours in advance online/in dong hoi vs in person, locally in phòng nhà? was leaning to local last minute as id assume it’s cheaper/more sustainable but have been offered a pretty package by someone we met tonight 1.02mil dong for multiple caves + transport to phòng nha also making me reconsider is how vague the public bus route stops are in dong hoi - anyone know if the bus stop on tran hung dao / nguyễn hữu canh intersection has the b4? 
 thank you! :)

                              <span>Hello! When my Uncle served for the US Army in Vietman, he was stationed in Nha Trang. His experience was far different than so many other veterans - he had a pretty good life while he was there and has been back to visit, in fact. He managed to get into a relationship with a local woman named Diep (out of respect I am not posting her full name) which he still reminisces of fondly to this day. He yearns to know that she is okay.

 This is a shot in the dark but I wanted to at least let my Uncle know that I shared his story. I also realize that she and many others may have had a completely different perspective of things. Apologies ahead of time but this is about their relationship, nothing else. He is getting very old and this is one of the last things that he&#x27;s never gotten closure on. If you know or knew this woman, enjoy the pictures. If you wish to share anything about her, please do. I&#x27;ll share them with him.
 Thank you. Be well.

                              <span>Hi guys, this is my first post on reddit so go easy on me 😉 I&#x27;m meant to be travelling to central Vietnam in the next few days, but I&#x27;m considering extending my stay in the North if Hoi An/ Hue are still hugely impacted by the floods.
 Does anyone have an update of the conditions in that area? Any help appreciated 🙏

                              <span>So getting married in Vietnam in December. My wife to be ❤️ wants my family to greet her family &amp; ask for our families to join? I’m not sure she told me it’s very traditional and a must. My uncle ask me for a template or an example. Can I get some help here? Anyone have to do this before?

                              <span>The effects of Covid aside, what&#x27;s going on beach-side in Da Nang? It seems like 70% of the hotels stopped being built at some point during their construction. Additionally there&#x27;s many that are open and staffed but always empty.
 I assume a certain degree of corruption or money laundering, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that on this scale. I would love to the longer story if there is one...

                              <span>Today, lying contemplatively, I suddenly sat and pondered about charity. I looked at it from a different perspective.
 If there were no charity missions, would the children there not know about the existence of better food, nicer clothes? Most people know that charity is often organized with groups going to remote areas for a few days, cooking, providing clothes, books, and supplies, and then everyone goes back home.
 The children/people in those areas get to eat &#x27;okay&#x27; for a few meals, and then it goes back to reality as usual. So, does charity bring any meaning to the people there? Or is it a way for the children to see themselves as &#x27;poor&#x27; compared to society? So, if there were no charity, or if they didn&#x27;t go on social media to see others &#x27;flexing&#x27;, would their lives be less self-conscious?

                              <span>3 years ago, Vietnam goverment threatened to ban Facebook, scaring a lot of foreign investors of a direction that reminds them of China. It didn&#x27;t happen but Vietnam is developing their own domestic social media to have a tighter control. Do you think Vietnam will follow China&#x27;s footsteps in the future of doing that?

                              <span>Hey all, I&#x27;ve booked a flight from Thailand to Vietnam via VietJet and received the booking confirmation and booking number in my email. However, there&#x27;s no actual flight ticket anywhere to be found! The Vietjet website FAQ section seems to imply a second email with the tickets should&#x27;ve been sent out with the booking confirmation but I&#x27;ve never received this. If I use my booking number on the Vietjet website to retrieve my booking details it only shows me my flight itinerary, no ticket.
 Has anyone had this experience with Vietjet before? I know it&#x27;s a budget airline and it&#x27;s got it&#x27;s money saving ways (read: scummery) but I&#x27;d still love to hear any advice.

                              <span>Hi,
 I adjusted my travels to not end up in Huế when the floodwaters were up high, but some people have told me it’s now subsided.
 Can anyone in Huế give an update on the flooding today? Is the citadel area, northwest of the river, now dry? And are restaurants and markets operating normally?

 I come with a question and hope to get an answer because this is impacting my study. 
 While learning I notice some sayings would use “do la” vs “nay”. How do I differentiate when to use them? 
 Example: do la mot chiec vậy đẹp. that is a beautiful skirt. 
 Quyền sach nay đặt tiền. This book is expensive. 
 Ban co thích cứ a hang nay khong? Do you like this store? 
 So basically I’m asking when is it nay and do la. Is this just something to remember or is there a grammar vocabulary thing I should work on to help transition my learning. 
 Cảm ơn VN and Reddit ❤️

                              <span>Hello ! I will be in Vietnam for a solid two weeks for a student program. It will be in the beggining of March! I&#x27;m of course really excited to get to know Vietnamese culture, to get a taste of a bit of everything. 
 But aside from my excitement, the beggining of March is also the start of Ramadan, holy month for us Muslims. Since I&#x27;ll be fasting and all, I would like to know how Muslims are perceived by the rest of the Vietnamese population. I saw that there are a lot of mosques, but maybe people don&#x27;t perceived it very well you know? So I rlly want to know from you guys! Thanks a lot!!

For my research I am trying to understand the history of the ethnic minorities and especially the programs that were initiated to relocate these minorities. I am trying to understand these programs such as program for poverry reduction such as program 34 on a national level but also on a province level or even district level. However I am not Vietnamese and it is hard for me to find critical articles or information in english... can maybe someone help me please? And if you maybe know some interesting settlements to do research on it would help me a lot! Thank you!

                              <span>Hey everyone
 My friend and me were remniscing and joking today about our Vietnam trip that we made almost 10 years ago.
 During the discussion we came upon the subject of hearing those generic beats and basslines of those Vinahouse tracks being played loud af in random shops in Southern Vietnam.
 You know, these famous &quot;DUN - DUH DUH DUH - DUN&quot; beats. 😂
 And during the discussion, we asked ourselves if there is an actual original song or remix that started it all.
 In that article here...
 https://danangleisure.com/vinahouse-in-a-nutshell-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-it
 ... there is the mention of a remix of a song called “Tình phai” by DJ Hoàng Trọc and DJ Alan Tian, that apparently initiated the birth of the genre.
 I searched for that particular remix here and there, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything.
 Does anyone know a hint or could point us to a specific song or remix? I am aware that Vinahouse songs are pretty much always just a silly remix of some other song, but there HAS TO BE ONE specific remix or track that started it all??
 I think of something like in that particular video here:

 Thanks to all you legends!

                              <span>Hi, we&#x27;re planning of travelling to Hanoi in December and doing an excursion to Hạ Long Bay area. We can plan to either do a 2 day 1 night cruise but typically these finish at midday and then travel back to Hanoi. Does anyone have any recommendations for trips that are 2 day 1 night but only travel back to Hanoi around 4/5 pm so make the most of the 2nd day? We are unable to do a 3 day 2 night trip as our flight is very early on the 3rd day.
 Alternatively does anyone know what cruises we can do that drop off at Cat Ba island on the 2nd day and we do our own thing before heading back to Hanoi? I believe the last boat/bus back is at 4pm, but please tell me if there are other later options for returning to Hanoi.
 Any any recommendations on if to do Lan Ha Bay/Cat ba island instead of Hạ Long Bay?

 Mới vụ gần đây có một tiktoker bị bóc phốt vì nói lớ tiếng việt. Căn bản là bạn này sinh ra ở Việt Nam nhưng sống ở Mỹ cũng được nhiều năm. Mới gần đây, bạn ấy có đăng một vài video trong đó bạn nói tiếng Việt có bị chậm. Không biết là ai ném đá trước nhưng sau một thời gian thì có nhiều Tiktoker khác bu vào chửi bới và khinh bỉ rằng OOP giả bộ không biết Tiếng Việt để tỏ vẻ Mỹ Trắng.
 Lúc đầu thì mình cũng ngỡ ngàng tại vì mình sống nước ngoài cũng khá lâu. Mình chưa bao giờ tiếp xúc với người Việt gốc nào giả bộ nói lớ tiếng Việt để “làm màu”. Những comments mình đọc được thì cũng nhiều thành phần nói thẳng ra là vô cùng vô văn hoá và thiếu suy nghĩ. Bao nhiêu người, già hay trẻ, xô vào để cấu xé cô gái có 22-24 tuổi làm vài video giải trí trên mạng. Rồi nhiều Tiktoker còn tự chế thông tin kêu là bạn này mới qua được một năm, bạn này bắt chước hoa hậu nào đó cũng bị lớ giọng sau khi học nhiều thứ tiếng. Thật sự là mình hơi ngạc nhiên khi thấy tình trạng bóc phốt bây giờ nhỏ nhặt đến mức chỉ nói lớ tiếng Việt là ăn chửi. Liệu Tiktok VN bây giờ có thô thiển quá mà chỉ toàn “The Drama”, kiếm nạn nhân để mà chửi câu view hay không?

                              <span>There were me+guide, two .nl girls+guide and a fellow droning.
 Sunrise was magical. I wanted to come back down by cable car to preserve my knees, so had an hour and a half all alone up there after they all left.
 Highly recommend.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a white guy travelling slowly by train and stopped in a small station called Bong Son 80km north of Quy Nhon then went 15km north with a taxi. There&#x27;s obviously very little tourism there especially westerners so at least 1/3 of people say hello or ask questions, kids come running to me etc but mostly positive encounters.
 Of course some laugh at me because I&#x27;m a 185cm dude on some tiny multicolor bicycle I got from my hotel roaming the dirt roads but I don&#x27;t mind.
 But today I was cycling at this spot https://maps.app.goo.gl/WJqaow9SXyUgEGic9 and a young guy around 16yo on a scooter stopped me in the middle of the road and was quite angry for some reason. Couldn&#x27;t speak a word of english and I can&#x27;t speak vietnamese. He left after maybe 2 minutes so I kept going the same way (down south to get to a creek) and he turned back, turned again and was behind me and gave me a kick with his foot in the back of my bicycle.
 I realised he certainly didn&#x27;t want me to go that way for some reason so I turned back and I didn&#x27;t see him again.
 Any idea what happened there ? It&#x27;s not like there were house nearby or I was in a private property.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am studying sleeping arrangements in Southeast Asian sleeping arrangements for a graduate school final project. If you are from Vietnam (preferrably live in Vietnam also) and could spare 30-45 mins to answer a few questions, I would really appreciate it! We can find a time that works for both of us and set up a Zoom meeting, thank you!

                              <span>Wow what can I say, it&#x27;s been 18 years since I&#x27;ve been here, I came here when I was 12 and when bird flu was an issue. It&#x27;s so incredibly different, for context, I&#x27;m Vietnamese Australian and being here made me fall in love with the life here, although maybe that&#x27;s idealistic but living in a western society for so long made me realise how deeply problematic the social system and dynamic are, it might work for some and it might not work for others but I love it here, btw this is my first solo trip and well... So far here&#x27;s my experience, the ho Chi Minh song from vietjetair is stuck in my head, I feel a deep sense of pride for him even though I wasn&#x27;t born here,I oddly comfortable here, I ate Banh mi Huynh hoa, I spoke to the locals, I got scammed but hey it&#x27;s all experienced so I&#x27;m not mad, just a little disappointed but hey it&#x27;s life. People are helpful, willing to help.
 So I guess this probably a very adventurous start, and a big welcome to Vietnam. Wow, that&#x27;s day 1 anyway till I post again, next flight Hanoi !
 If there is anything fun to do and awesome food/drink to try, please let me know !

 blue pin
 My concerns are:
  
air quality
 are there bike paths along those rivers where I can exercise
 can I rent a decent size apartment (over 40 sq. meters) within walking distance for under 1000 USD (prefer a bit lower).
  
I have never been to Vietnam but have only heard good things about living and working there. 
 Please feel free to comment or advise.

 Anyone has any idea that how long the letter will be released by the customs ?
 It is literally just a letter a paper

                              <span>We drove all over southern Vietnam and 99% of the roads look exactly like this. Even the roads out in the countryside. They&#x27;re not very smooth (apparently they don&#x27;t have road smoothing machines) but they&#x27;re otherwise flawless. They&#x27;re better than the roads in Seattle.

                              <span>Hi, we are currently planning to go to central Vietnam from Hanoi -&gt; Ninh Binh &gt; Phong Nha &gt; Hue &gt; Hoi An &gt; Da Nang. Arriving in Hue on 21st and leaving Da Nang for Ho Chi Minh on 29th but because the current flooding in Hue we were wondering whether to completely skip central Vietnam and just go to the south. Do you think it&#x27;s ok to go there still or should we miss it?
 My main concern is the flooding but also will it be mainly raining whilst we&#x27;re there too? 
 Are Hoi an and da Nang impacted by the floods? And is transport still possible?
 In which case thinking of spending more time in the south.
 Recommendations from people locally are really appreciated or have been before!

 What are things to look out for?
 Approximately how much do gold/silver/platinum wedding band rings go for in Vietnam?
 As I am not on jeweler myself, how do I ensure I am actually getting a ring with the correct metal and not a knock off?

                              <span>Hi, we are two canadians traveling for three months in Vietnam and we will like suggestions for a place to stay (city/village) for a couple weeks. We enjoy nature and calm but also maybe a place with a couple bars where we can meet people and also some nice cultural events. We were thinking somewhere north and we are not sure if we are going to stay very long in the south because of the hot weather. ( We like the cold!) Eventhough our flight back home will be leaving from Ho Chi Minh City. We are in Hanoï right now and we are craving for a place much less busy and quieter (we have been in cities for the past 3 weeks). It can also be in center Vietnam, we were thinking of being there at the end of December / beginning of January. Thank you for you advice!

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I am a 27M from Western Europe but living in Korea since 2 years.
 I was recently contacted by a Korean giant company to work in Vietnam on a more leadership role than what I do now.
 Everything seems great for now however when going across the recruiter&#x27;s profile I could see that they offered 30M/month on this job.
 As I don&#x27;t know anything about Vietnam or their currencies, I checked the change and I was surprised to see that it was not even meeting the mininmum wage in my home country.
 I understand that economy and buying power may be different in Vietnam, however I am bound to travel a lot (Home country, Korea, SEA...).
 Because it seems so low, I was wondering if it was a scam or a possible mistake, or if it is a normal and decent salary in Vietnam.
 Edit : The job would be in Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu
 Edit 2 : I got a lot of answers, thank you for your reactivity !
 As far as I know, this is not a scam - I got contacted on LinkedIn and everything is linked to this worldwide korean company, including the job listing.
 As a LinkedIn expert myself having done a lot of recruitment, you can&#x27;t usurpate identity and pretend to be from another company while posting a job.
 I didn&#x27;t receive details about the salary yet. I just found the 30M information on the recruiter&#x27;s profile.
 Thanks to you, from my understanding it may be great for a local but not for an expat. Let&#x27;s hope their package is evolving if they want to hire an expat, or let&#x27;s pray that they forgot a number !
 Thank you

                              <span>I know this might not be well received, but it is my experience and wanted to share.
 Just finished a 7 days motorcycle tour in Ha Giang that started and ended in Hanoi.
 I&#x27;ve never seen a more scary place than Hanoi and surrounding area from a pollution, crowded and garbage perspective.
 The 70 km from Thai Nguyen to Hanoi I felt like I&#x27;m riding through the end of the world. 
 You cannot see the sky and buildings afar from pollution, over industrialization that pollutes every living thing, garbage everywhere.
 In the city sitting in traffic between a mass of cars, trucks emitting black smoke and scooters I felt like I&#x27;m going to pass out.
 Absolute hellish experience. Probably my first and last time in that city.

                              <span>I will be flying from Singapore to Da Nang in December from a Saturday evening to Monday evening. After that I will fly to Hanoi for two more nights. 
 I am an amateur photographer (website here for reference) and am very interested in photographing the fishing villages around Da Nang and Hoi An--more particularly Hoi An where I anticipate heading to after landing in Da Nang. I would like to photograph fisherman with their nets out on the water but also people mending/storing nets in the villages. Stylistically, this would be very similar to Réhan&#x27;s work with fishing villages.
 I am looking for recommendations on where near Hoi An (or Da Nang) people fish. I understand there is some fishing right of Cua Dai beach. Would hiring a boat on the Thu Bon river allow for easier viewing of fisherman?
 Thanks!

                              <span>hi, so my parents are ethnic chinese, born and raised in vietnam, the family needed to flee south vietnam late 70s early 80s
 i really did not understand what the vietnam war actually was about til i got older cause through their lense it was mainly „well the communist were shit and evil towards us“ but they did not mention too much the american army. so i grew up thinking „well these communist folks were super bad“ (and „communist“ was used interchangebly with „north vietnamese“). also, grew up pretty western, so the evil communist narrative is kinda norm.
 at some point, a couple of years ago i watched this long documentary series called „vietnam“ by us-american documentary filmmaker ken burns, and for me, it was a very significant turning point cause now all the „evil communist“ had faces, their story, their motive. that being said, of course i knew the narrative of my parents are by no means universal. but you know, that was basically the only story all your life.
 however, i never knew that this war was so incredibly complex, not only since the beginning of the american engagement. for me the documentary doesn‘t seem to biased, on the contrary, it reveals alot of the american misjudgment and bad (and dare to say, evil) decisions. 
 how do you guys perceive the documentary? do people in vietnam know this movie? what effect did it have on you, if you‘ve seen it? genuinely interested in some thoughts

                              <span>For context I’m Hoa— but I speak Viet and Mandarin (from university) mostly. But I recently had to finish a paper and thinking writing about Viet would be probably easy. I ran across the work of Mark Alves, a linguist who basically reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of Vietic language. And I started to realise how Vietnamese really kinda stands on its own as being a SouthEastern and East Asian language. I don’t why but this was my shower thought about why there is so much Chinese built within Vietnamese language.
 I noticed in his work there was a lot of old Chinese (and of course other dialects and Chinese words over history) still used in Vietnamese. I had a weird shower thought that Vietnamese language seems like a sponge for Chinese language, if they didn’t have an existing word for it they just take it from their big neighbours. And I think hearing from my family about colonialism isn’t the whole story why there’s so many words adopted. I’m curious about if anyone knows if there are studies on this.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am a so called &quot;Việt kiều&quot; in my early 20s. Born and raised in America. I have been back to Vietnam 4 times since I was 12, with the most recent trip being about a month ago. It was the first time coming back as a grown adult, so I did and saw a lot more. It was the most memorable trip of my life.
 Returning to America, I feel my life is boring. I don&#x27;t have many friends, and I hate my job. It felt weird to have to return and live in a country that is so quiet and...sterile in comparison. We have a Viet community here in my state, but it pales in comparison to Texas, Cali. I miss Vietnam so much, I am considering getting a 90 day visa and returning before Tết, living off of savings. I have family who are more than happy to accommodate me, but I also want to rent a place for a mon…</span>

 During my last trip to south east Asia I visited Vietnam and, of course, I fell in love with the Country.
 I also really enjoyed Hoi An and its charm, and I had the opportunity to get some tailored suits (of course) and to buy some leather items such as wallets, keychain, etc.
 I bought the leather stuff in a store called Da Bao, which I tried to send some email to see if they can do international shipments. But unfortunately I had no replies. 
 So my question to you guys is, can you recommend a good store who can do it? (of course non strictly from hoi an).
 Cảm ơn!

 Also, i am considering the option of taking a car/bus on the highway. Wondering which option would be better. 
 Keeping my fingers crossed, hope everything gets better and y’all stay safe. ❤️

                              <span>Recently, I made several transactions to withdraw funds from an ATM. Most ATMs only allow foreigners to take out 3 million Vietnam dong per transaction.
 Out of several 500,000 VND bills, one of them is slightly torn. I took a picture of the ATM and the ATM number and information on it.
 Have been here before in the past they made a big deal about a slightly torn and 200,000 VND note, and would not take it.
 According to this law site, it states any bank per the law needs to replace a ripped bill, however, and practice does this work? Or should I just tape it and try to use it somewhere? The tear is maybe 4-5mm on the bottom of the note.

 When people have money in one of the above cases, they will have the right to exchange money at the bank. This is the obligation of the Bank as stipulated in Article 6 of the Circular No. 25/2013/TT-NHNN. According to the provision of Article 6, for money that is not eligible for circulation as stipulated in Clause 1 and Clause 3, Article 4 of this Circular, State Bank branches, Central Banking Department, the collecting-exchanging unit shall be responsible for immediate withdrawal, exchange for customers who have demand, without limit of quantity and requirement of procedures. For money that is not eligible for circulation as stipulated in Clause 2 Article 4 of this Regulation, the above units shall receive and consider exchanging with the conditions specified in Point a, b Clause 2 Article 6 of this Circular. If the conditions for money exchange are not satisfied, these units shall return the money to customers and give a notice of the reason thereof.

                              <span>I caught the night train down from Hanoi last night. We hit massive flooding just outside Hue (Quang Tri) and stopped at 7am. 
 We haven’t moved since. We can’t get off the train, and we’re not being given any information by the staff, or the tourism company the train service is with. There’s not much food or water, and the staff are hiding from us. 
 I’m starting to get quite worried and stressed. Does anyone know when the floods will recede? Or could we be stuck here on the train until the weekend or longer? We’re scared we will run out of food and water and power soon. We definitely won’t move until morning now. 
 We would get off and try to find a car to take us back north, but it’s dark and too risky, we don’t know the situation out there. 
 Please stay safe everyone in the region!
 Edit: woke up. We’ve still not moved. We’ve been on the train for 36 hours+ now. It’s still raining heavily. My boyfriend is starting to get sick and is coughing with no water. We’re starting to get very sad and scared. We haven’t seen any staff members for 10+ hours. We’re not at a station so can’t get off. We’re on a ‘tourist carriage’ so no Vietnamese to ask for help. We’re ‘safe’ physically from the rain, and I’m grateful for that, but I’m so fed up of not knowing. At this point, we just want to fly back home from what was meant to be our dream trip. I feel so, so guilty for suggesting we take the train 😭 
 Edit 2: staff has abandoned us. We cannot find them. We have had news and no supplies for 12+ hours. Everyone is leaving the train and trying to escape now. We know it’s not safe, but we will also risk leaving now while it’s still light and the rain has stopped for a while. We will try to get to Dong Ha, then go north.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve gotten stuck in Hue tonight on one of the few non flooded streets (Doi Cung).
 Just wondering what everyone else is doing to kill the time and if there&#x27;s a non flooded cafe or bar people are headed to.

                              <span>For 22 years of my life, I’ve never ever heard my parents say Xin Chao when talking to friends and family on the phone while living in America to give context my parents are immigrants, I was born in America. Plus, ever time I hear or see the word Xin Chao, it reminds me of the League of Legends champion.
 Am I the odd one?

                              <span>A Vietnamese friend of mine is in big financial difficulties. Stupidly he took loans from illegal lenders - sharks @ 15% interest per month. He paid interest every month but none of the principal amount, so far 90% of the loan value. 
 Considering this kind of lending is illegal, how can he get out of this and negotiate better terms without ending up injured or worse?

                              <span>As the title suggest, it is currently flooded and my flight out is tomorrow morning at 10. Should I pack some food now and head on out to the airport now?
 I don&#x27;t think the waters are going to clear out overnight so I&#x27;m better off going now vs struggling tomorrow?
 What do you guys think is the best course of action?
 I probably have to find higher ground then flag down a cab or book a grab to the airport? I&#x27;m guessing I can wash up there and wait overnight for my flight.
 I have a friend flying out tonight, she&#x27;s heading to Saigon. I will just checkout today despite paying till tomorrow. Is there food available at HUI Airport?
 Edit: was trapped in the hotel, the staff had locked up the doors and abandoned us. Absolute bizarre experience but turns out it was tied up.
 Untied and made it to the streets before a boat picked up us. Currently staying at a homestay just a km away from the airport.
 What an experience.

                              <span>We are getting married on Christmas Eve and hoping to find a good bar/nightclub for our after-party in Saigon. I&#x27;m Viet but have lived abroad for quite some time now so pretty clueless about the nightlife scene of the city.
  
Good music (no vinahouse please)
 Lively but not too loud
 No sketchy scenes (no overt drug use)
 Does not cost an arm and a leg
  
Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, I need your help! Where can I buy essentials with receipt after lost luggage. 
 Ive arrived yesterday in Vietnam (Hanoi) yesterday for the first time. Unfortunately, I learmed when I arrived at the airport that my checked bag has not made it through with me. I was lucky enough to have pack my most expensive item with me (just in case you know...) But now I&#x27;m left without clothes and over the counter medications (tynenol, gravol, Imodium, ...).
 I have been trying to find places to buy back some stuff in Hanoi today that are legit and provide receipt. While I was able to get some medications I&#x27;m Pharmacity in Hanoi. I&#x27;ve not been able to find legit places to get basic clothes with receipt. I went to a mall that have Amerian brands to try to find something that is not a random store in the street but realized that there is only men&#x27;s clothes and everything is well overpriced aven comparer with Canada. 
 Do you know a good place to go to shop for essentials, most importantly shoes but also shorts, pants, shirts where they give receipt and prices are ok? My itinerary &#x27;/reservation are to go to Cat Ba and Nin Ninh in the next day but I doubt I&#x27;ll find something there. I&#x27;m very lost at this point so I&#x27;m ok going back to Hanoi of required. Please help me!

                              <span>Observed this interesting feature recently in Mai Châu from the scenic overlook above (this picture from Google). What is the purpose of this paved area? Appears too short for a runway, but not a street either?

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve stayed here for a bunch of years now and I always had a gaming PC with me. Every house/apartment I&#x27;ve lived in, my PC case or peripherals like microphone or any metallic parts will discharge a painful static shock to the part that touches my person. 
 I&#x27;ve checked online to make sure I did everything within my control, things like no carpet under the CPU, new power cables, quality extension plugs and no stray exposed cables touching the case. 
 Wall plugs here doesn&#x27;t have the 3 hole option so that&#x27;s telling me something is not grounded hence the shocks. 
 If it helps, my microphone gives out a permanent static white noise with or without my voice activating the microphone, tested by using the &quot;listen to this device function. 
 Questions: 
  
Should I change my PSU? 
 
Should I call the electrician to come and ground my house properly (I recently built a new house)? 
 
Are there any work arounds for those who experienced the same problem? 
 
Gamers with gaming laptops, do you get shocks from your laptops while its charging? (I am seriously considering getting a laptop because of this problem but I am unsure if it makes any difference because of the lack of grounding) 
 
 Any help is greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 My brother, nephew and I are going to HCM in January. We are staying near the Bui Vien street and this is no hate towards tourists like we are, but it&#x27;s also nice to experience the &#x27;real nightlife&#x27; like the locals experience it. 
 All three of us are happily in a relationship right now, so it&#x27;s not about &#x27;hunting&#x27; girls. It&#x27;s all about having a good time in a bar or club. Something different than Bui Vien (or something located on Bui Vien but not really tourist-heavy). Do you guys have some tips and tricks for us three?

                              <span>Hello everyone 
 It seems like I may be going to Vietnam sometime in December 2023/January 2024. I am still waiting for e-visa to be approved. What will the weather be like there at around this time? Is there any trains going in/out of the different cities? I ask because I tried googling it and it gave me nothing. 
 This is my first time in Vietnam. We will be flying in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), I have no itinerary right now, but what do you recommend visiting from Saigon, mostly day trips or a night or two stay overs? And share any other information you want. 
 I am super excited to be visiting, if I do end up going. Many thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am still disturbed by what I saw yesterday.
 On the shoulder of a road, there was a truck. On the loading area, numerous crates were filled with dogs. In each crate, there were so many dogs that they were stacked on top of each other. Some of the dogs were trembling, utterly frightened, or not moving at all. I suspect some of them were already dead.
 I presume these are stray dogs that have been captured. But what is done with them? Are they taken somewhere and killed? Is that even legal? If they are killed, why are they subjected to such cruelty first? Not to mention, I don&#x27;t find killing them acceptable.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 Bit of a weird/obscure one but a while back I saw a video about a banh mi place in Saigon (possibly elsewhere but 99% sure). Their main speciality was a huge banh mi with beef short rib as the meat, they put it on the roll with the bone still in and then pull the bone out.
 I&#x27;m flying into Vietnam for the 7th time later this week and was hoping to try this place but have lost any record of it and can&#x27;t find it anywhere. Hoping someone here may be familiar with it and can help.
 If it helps, they also offered a few more different/fancy banh mis including a seafood one with caviar. It wasn&#x27;t one of the $100 banh mis or anything, was about 3-400K or so and big enough to feed 2 people.

 I had Indian for before in Saigon but it sucked. So finding place is a lucky find.

                              <span>Hello! First post here. Currently exploring Saigon,and l just visited Takishimaya at Saigon centre and nabbed a RG Epyon! Love that place since I visited last time because I don’t have to deal with markup prices. Do you guys know what are some other good spots to pick up weeb (I.E Gundam, Vtuber, etc) stuff from? (And maybe some accessories for a ROG ally) Will check post tomorrow.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be visiting Vietnam for the first time soon, and I read a lot about using very cheap grab bikes. This concept of jumping on a bike behind a stranger and letting them drive you on a freaking bike scares the shit out of me 😅 How does it even work - do you hold/hug them from behind or how do you hold? Isn&#x27;t the helmet they give you super gross from all previous passengers who leave their sweat there? Is it even safe to use?
 Those are genuine questions, not a rant 🙂

 I see the beach and assume warm but in January I doubt people are swimming? 
 Thank you!

                              <span>I’m going to rant here because this happened on a VietJet flight, but I’ve noticed other Asian airlines have the same stupid rules.
 The 7kg cabin baggage limit doesn’t make any sense! It’s supposed to be the combined limit for the carry-on and the personal item, but both are usually over this limit. Any carry-on under 7kg would be mostly empty. 
 I don’t care if an airline wants to make more money and charge more. They can certainly do so, but they should have reasonable rules and clear prices.
 I just had a bad experience checking in to a VietJet flight where the employe made me empty my carry-on and put half of the things in my big bag and half in my backpack. They checked in my big bag which was now slightly over the 20kg limit and my almost empty carry-on. They kept telling me to make my backpack lighter, but it was that heavy because of my laptop, iPad and battery pack which can’t be checked in because they contain lithium batteries. I kept asking them what to do, but even they didn’t know the solution and eventually just let me go.

                              <span>👋 hello. American looking for authentic cha gio here in the states. Specifically, many Vietnamese restaurants use egg-based (yellow) roll wrap paper and not the clear, white rice paper. I was always told that the yellow one was the Chinese way of making them, and that proper cha gio were made with the clear ones. (Is this true?) Personally, I prefer the clear white wraps 100% of the time. I’m disappointed when I order cha gio in a restaurant and I get the yellow kind. Does anyone know how I can ask what kind of paper they use and what answer reflects my preferences? Will a Vietnamese restaurant look at me sideways for even asking?
 Thanks!
 Background: American, but my (White) grandmother was born and raised in Vietnam. Our family has since adopted some Vietnamese dishes as part of our family culinary traditions, including thit koh, bun thit, and cha gio. Looking to maintain those family traditions in the way I was taught. 😊

                              <span>So my bros and I are all legally blind. We still work out and like to party and eat out and stuff, so the other day we went to our favorite neighborhood spot for some grub. There were about 30 of us, and although we can’t see a thing, we have excellent hearing and some of us speak English.
 So we were seated around various tables and we heard this foreign guy seeming to have a great time with his female friends. There were all just chatting and we figured out that he was gay and they were out having a “ladies day” of sorts. He was joking around with them and gossiping like one of the girls. He kept saying stuff like “no betch” and “that’s right girl, he ain’t all that”.
 Then we heard the sound of another foreigner and he also sounded effeminate. He seemed to be trying to flirt with the first guy. The first guy suddenly pretended to be all macho and changed his voice. We were like bruh.
 We heard what sounded like hands grabbing plump body parts and we heard some kissing. Then the other gay guy got even madder and was saying stuff like “you know you don’t like them, you big faker” and then we heard footsteps storming off.
 So we all just chuckled and went on with our meal. You hear a lot of wacky stuff around here if you just stop to listen

 Mình có 1 cô hàng xóm, thân với mẹ mình lắm, cổ cũng thương mình như con vậy đó, năm 2019 cô và chồng đi Canada. Mình có đứa bạn mới quen, hai đứa cũng thân nhau, xong nó cũng đi du học nước ngoài luôn. Cảm giác nó lạ thiệt hen mọi người, mới ngày nào họ còn ở đây ngay cạnh mình mà giờ mỗi người 1 khung trời rồi.

                              <span>It was a warm breezy afternoon this past Saturday, and I had this huge hankering for some of Cô Linh’s gourmet street food, and without giving it a second thought, rode my bike to and then pulled up a little plastic red chair to Auntie’s food cart and gleefully asked for a hot bowl of Bún Bò Huế. 
 Out of the corner of my eye, observed what appeared to be an ethnically Malaysian tourist, a “brownie” smiling cheek-to-cheek, sitting with these very attractive and somewhat scantily, but not unusually dressed Vietnamese females, but thought nothing of it as one of them was my cousin, Trang, and the other two, knew from the High School karaoke club and the local Kung Fu dojo, as one of the other girls was a well accomplished martial arts champion.

                              <span>We were paid like 2 million VND each for the GFE so no complaint from us. We took him for something to eat before we go back to his hotel since we were quite a bit hungry. Although a bit drunk, he agreed. While eating, he was a bit handsy so we wanted to finish the meal quickly so we could get back to the hotel and do the deeds. 
 Out of nowhere, this tourist confronted our John, and said that he should stop. He made a big scene and everyone was looking at us. We thought the tourist was going to get into a fight with our John, so instead of it escalating, me and my girls just paid for the food and got out of there ASAP. 
 ​
 Guys, how do I avoid situation like this? Do I get handsy myself on the John so that tourist don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m being kidnapped?

                              <span>Look nothing against tourist as I am a tourist as well. I tour Vietnam quite often from Maylasia, and this is starting to happen more frequently. I was minding my own business and having fun with three other Viet women. They were like 45 kilograms of chicken these women. The women were enjoying themselves with the drinks I was buying. I was balling out with these 45 kilogram chicken and they were loving it. Then all the sudden this crazy tourist comes over trying to be a hero and tell me to take my hands off the product. I ignored him as I paid for these women, so I kissed them. He said something again about me touching the woman. So I grabbed the women again to piss him off and kissed them as well. The guy looked miserable. Like he had come to vacation with his wife and mother in law. He was jealous as I left my wife and mother in law at home. Why would you bring that kind of sand to the beach? There is plenty of sand here to play with. Any how, the women were having fun and enjoying my company. These tourist should mind their business just like I was. We are some hard working men from Malaysia here for some R&amp;R. These type of tourist confuse me. Are they here to vacation and have fun or play some fantasy superhero? If the women were in trouble they could scream or call the police. There was plenty of people around and we were all having fun. 🤩 Enjoy life my people.

                              <span>Just a fun story I wanted to share, no offense to anyone who digs the style I‘m going to talk about.
 My dad migrated from Vietnam 30 years ago and what striked me almost my whole adolescent life was his particular style of clothing. Like everything has a luxury brand name on it. All in all it it’s this kind of „young money“ street style from 2010. Sunglasses, caps, LV satchel, expensive watch, you name it, paired with buddhist accessories. From a fashion standpoint it’s completely randomly combined. This stands out even more since no other 60 year old man dresses this way in the country I grew up in. Though I’d say especially migrant groups tend to do that as well as a status symbol though there‘s something, besides the jade bracelets and stuff, that makes it so different and I really can‘t say what.
 And then, in 2019, I visited Vietnam for my first time. And when I walked around Bui Vien street or took the local busses, I’ve seen other middle aged men that radiated some thuggish ominous vibe like bouncers and I realized They wear the same outfits!! I don‘t know what exactly made it so similar but the composition of their outfits reminded me immediately of my dad. I had the feeling they wore even more accessories like a watch but also a jade bracelet and a wooden pearl bracelet on the same arm. It‘s so weird hahaha but now I know, where he got that inspiration from

 Don&#x27;t think the school has a hall to contain the noise so that means neighbors have to wake up when they start their practice session...at 7am.

                              <span>Hi! Sorry if this is an odd question lmao. So I love my nail tech, she is wonderful at her job and also really fun and easy to talk to. She is from vietnam and started a successful nail salon in the United States with her family. I was chatting with her and I said the acetone solution looks like Kool aid and she said she doesn&#x27;t know what Kool aid is and has never had it. As gross as it may sound to some Kool aid was a big part of my life growing up and while I don&#x27;t drink it in adulthood since its not the best for you I still love it. Would it be rude for me to bring her some? Unopened obviously. I feel like it may come across as rude or making fun of her and that is NOT my intention. I&#x27;m posting this here because I&#x27;m unaware of the nuances in Vietnamese culture surrounding gift giving and such. The last thing I want to do is offend her.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;ll be visiting soon and thought I might try and get some flow toys while I&#x27;m over but I guess that depends on if there is anywhere to pick them up? In Aus it&#x27;s pretty much online only and I would rather not pay someone to import it only for me to have to buy it unseen anyway! Cheers.

                              <span>Not sure if this is the right place to ask, got these from a family friend who was travelling in Vietnam for a few weeks, we find them really difficult and think we might be eating them wrong? Is it meant to be so powdery, instructions on the back say &#x27;ready to eat&#x27;

                              <span>Hey guys, me and a friend will be travelling through Vietnam this december and are planning to spent most of our time in the North of Vietnam especially in the Sa Pa area for some hiking and being in mother nature. We‘re a bit worried that during this time of the year the nature isnt as beautiful due to the rice already being harvested and the weather being very rainy or cloudy. What has been your experience in the region regarding our worries?
 Thank you very much in advance :)

                              <span>Planning to go to Ky Quan San (3046m) - Bach Moc Luong Tu mountain range in Lao Cai province this december. Do you guys have any contact of the local potters from this Area? I’m planning to do this one solo with one of my friends and i don’t really like going with the big groups from other’s tour organizers. My friend can speak Vietnamese btw.
 Someone said this one is one of the hardest climb in Vietnam. Is it possible to do this for 2 days and 1 night instead of 3?
 Thank you guys for the help!

 In one of those restaurant/shops with outdoor seatings on those mini plastic chairs I saw a middle-aged brown guy that was talking up these three Vietnamese women while they were eating. The girls looked like they were half his age. 
 The girls looked much younger than the guy but he was really handsy with them. He then grabbed the head of one of them and then force kissed her right on the mouth. He started laughing in the happiest way and then kissed the other two girls in the same manner. 
 I kind of just stopped and started staring at them for a quick second because I was shocked and then the guy put his …</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I’ll be travelling to Hanoi for 4d3n at the end of this month. I’ll be staying in the old quarters, now I’ve seen a few posts here shitting on the old quarters, how true are they? I’ll be staying at an airbnb and have been asked for my passport pic by the owner to show to the police? is crime very rampant there?
 Also what are some must go and no go in Hanoi? I’ll be taking a daytrip to Halong bay too so I guess it’s more of a 3d2n trip in Hanoi.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I often read of drug smugglers, for example, getting the death sentence. But I don&#x27;t recall ever reading news of a sentence being carried out. I&#x27;m kind of hoping that this might be because it usually isn&#x27;t actually done; that maybe these sentences are often commuted to life in prison or whatever. I also understand that the death penalty is carried out by firing squad. Can anyone enlighten me on this please?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be in Vietnam for my first international trip (solo!) 
 Will be in SEA Dec 30 - Jan 19. 
 My flight is into Bangkok, and my flight out is Hanoi, Vietnam. 
 I was thinking most of my time split between Thailand and Vietnam, and a sprinkle of Cambodia. 
 But, how do I make the most of Vietnam?

                              <span>I rented an apartment from VXH, a government high ranking manager, possibly some general. The apartment is in Mipec complex, Hà Đông, Hà Nội. When I vacated the place, he visited the place and confirmed that he will return the deposit. He carried on my duty to pay the bills and lèa the house. Later on, he also replied a message to return the money on Oct 12. However, it has been a month since, and he has not returned the deposit. He refused my phone calls and never reply his reason not to return the money. Since sueing or asking for money is potentially problematic, I want to ask. 1. is it ok to ask his friends/wife/people at his place for his whereabouts? 2. how to sue now that I left Hà Nội and can&#x27;t return. Would the government office, whatever that handles the case request me to be in Hanoi to carry on with the case? I also have heard that his wife works in the court and this will most likely thrown out. So how to make sure that the case will go. 3) there are many laws, on of which is the notorious 331 that puts people in prison for supposedly defamation of character. Their law in defamation of character is not like in the States - I have no profit or ill intention to do this beside getting my money. So how to avoid this?

                              <span>Which airline is more lenient towards your cabin luggage? I&#x27;ll be flying from Saigon to Bali and back, and I think my carry on is a bit larger than their stated dimensions. Never had any issues flying large carriers in Europe or US, but it will be my first time flying an Asian low coster.

 Hey, I&#x27;ll spend 3 weeks in vietnam with my gf in march/april and we&#x27;re staying in Nha Trang for 6 days. She really liked this hotel but something feels off. Some comments on booking are a bit weird and I can&#x27;t find much on google, but it&#x27;s on booking so... Anyone knows anything about it? 
 Otherwise, any recommendations for a good resort/hotel in Nha Trang, Tuy Hoa or around that area? Nha Trang is where I&#x27;m ok spending money on accomodation since it&#x27;s the only place where we&#x27;ll actually spend time at the hotel/resort, so I&#x27;m looking for one of those 5 stars with amazing buffets, pools and all that. 
 Any other recomendations regarding Nha Trang and its surroundings are welcome :)

                              <span>Hello! I noticed some of my hotel bookings say proof of covid shot is needed. Wondering if this is just not updated, or if there are some select hotels checking for proof of vaccine.

                              <span>Around 9:30 PM tonight, November 11, 2023, I was passing through the Kim Liên tunnel, Hanoi, Vietnam. I was on the back of a fast-moving motorbike when I randomly looked up at the sky and saw many flashing, color-changing circles like these. These are original videos and ones that have been made to slow motion so you can see everything in different speed. At first, I thought they were lights from a crane on a high-rise building, so I looked away. But a few seconds later, I looked up again and wondered “what? hold on…” how there could be such a high building in the sky! I tried to take a photo but couldn&#x27;t because the bike was moving too fast, so I recorded videos instead. It looked very surreal and strange in person. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this before. Did anyone else passing by that area tonight look up and see the same thing? Could these be drones? Can anyone explain what this might be?

                              <span>Tui trước thuê nhà của ông này, VXH, cán bộ cấp quản lý ở sân bay Gia Lâm. Khi tôi dọn đi đã bàn giao nhà đàng hoàng, và trả toàn bộ tiền điện nước dịch vụ, có xác nhận. Chủ nhà cũng hứa sẽ trả tiền cọc 8tr ngày 12/10. Căn nhà thuê ở chung cư Mipec, Quận Hà Đông. 
 Nhưng đến giờ thì ông ta vẫn chưa trả và không trả lời tôi. 
 Tôi không biết một cán bộ quân đội, sợ cái gì, mà không thể trả lời. 
 Không muốn trả hay bất cứ lý do gì thì ông ta cũng trả lời tôi một tiếng được. Chẳng lẽ một người lính lại không có dũng khí để nói ra được điều mình muốn. 
 Tôi chỉ muốn ông ta trả tiền, hay chí ích là trả lời. 
 Mà đòi thế nào cho hợp lý với ông cán bộ cấp cao này.
 1) đòi tiền thế nào trong khi ông ta không hợp tác? Nếu tôi nhắn tin đến gia đình người thân ông ta, chỉ để hỏi ông ta ở đâu, tôi cần kiếm để hỏi vụ cọc thì có được không?
 2) nếu kiện cáo thì khi triệu tập tôi có nhất thiết phải gặp không? Tôi không có ở HN, và ông ta thì ở HN.
 3) làm sao để tránh cái tội nhục mạ, khi bản chất việc lấy tiền của người khác là nhục, mà đòi tiền thì nhắc đến cái nhục đó?

 Probably sure this question gets asked a lot but do you have any recommendations for great Banh Mi spots and other foods and drinks (not the biggest pho fan sorry)
 I’m staying in the old quarter and would just like to avoid the usually tourist traps.
 Thank you

                              <span>When a foreign traveler first sets foot in unique Vietnam, they are immediately shocked by the bustling and intricate traffic scenes. Especially in major cities like Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, the streets of Vietnam are a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds, where thousands of vehicles move incessantly. Foreigners may be surprised to witness the sight of motorcycles – the dominant mode of transportation in Vietnam – gliding smoothly through narrow streets, sometimes carrying an entire family or towering loads of goods. Alongside these, leisurely bicycles, creatively crafted homemade vehicles, traditional ‘Xích lô’, and even large trucks jostle together, creating a multi-hued tapestry of urban life.

                              <span>Just 2 blocks down from my apartment, I had no idea until I went to my rooftop to hang my laundry. From what I heard, it started in a mechanic shop. 
 Praying for everyone’s safety and recovery.

                              <span>When my dad would host parties or Nhau ( sorry my Vietnamese isn&#x27;t that great) I would see like 6-7 uncles walk in with slabs of beer and laying newspapers all on the floor, in the night they would play music really loud, song karaoke and bang on the bowls with chopsticks. 
 My aunties would all be waiting until 5am so they can drive them home LOL 
 Near the end of the night, my uncle&#x27;s would fight eachother too and someone would go home with a black eye, the next week they come back, it&#x27;s all good hahah wth. 
 Anyway, my dad was drunk as fuck and he woke everyone up cause he was pissing so loud and you know what he said when he slammed the door open? 
 He goes &quot; Aaahhhhhhhhh TAO BAY LEN TROIII&quot;

Then, two days ago, my stomach started burning, I had a lot of acid reflux, a killer headache and extreme fatigue. My sister has exactly the same symptoms and we’ve eaten exactly the same things. I’ve been living on cheerios, bananas, and potatoes for two and a half days already. I’m here for another three weeks. Any advice on what I could eat? I tried pho and it was a big mistake. Anyone had a similar experience?

                              <span>Hey!
 We are Raven and the Dark Shadows, a rock band out of Miami Beach, Florida. Our album features musicians from Pearl Jam and New Found Glory.
 We are currently planning a Pacific tour and thinking of stopping in Vietnam on our route.
 Do you guys know of any cool venues. Something like an old theater or converted church is ideal for us. A capacity between 150 and 300 is ideal. Looking forward to visiting your beautiful country, and if you have any insider tips, please let us know!
 Thank you.

For example, in the case of a child passing away before their parents do, would they be integrated within the worship practices of the parents or grandparents, or not at all?

We all travel differently, and this style of itinerary is ours (experienced). However, I&#x27;m not sure if my listed method of transportation is the best option in reality. Can you please give me feedback on that? Please also give your &quot;must eat/see&quot; for these places if you have any!

 Edit: I have my tickets booked for landing into Hanoi airport on Sunday and leaving from Ho Chi Minh on Saturday evening. 
 I did this to break my long journey to my home and saved a couple hundred dollars in the process.

                              <span>Hi there,
 Visiting Hanoi for 2-3 weeks, and my partner and I are interested to meet some other artists. We&#x27;re in video game design, music, and videography. Any recommendations for where we could find live music or any sort of a scene related to the above? Limitation is that we don&#x27;t speak Vietnamese, so I understand if that might be quite hard at a deeper level.
 Similarly, what part of town would fit us best? We&#x27;ve both travelled a lot, and don&#x27;t need the coddling of having a boulangerie and pizza parlor within arms reach at all times.

                              <span>We just booked an early flight to Hanoi for almost 4 full days and wanted to do the 3D2N Ninh Binh - Ha Long cruise tour. I’m more interested in nature scenes and not a big city person, so a day in Hanoi is probably enough for me. The tour would have us stay the first night in Ninh Binh and then drive us to Ha Long the next day and stay overnight on a cruise. I read here that booking might be cheaper in the quarter but I’m not sure where to find them or which tour we should go with? I saw one online for $250 each which isn’t cheap. Would they also charge extra for water and other necessities? And would it feel too rushed to do this tour?

 We are trying to reach out to people that have lived or live in the flood vulnerable regions of the city and can give some insight of how the floods work and how the populations adapts it´s lifestyle and biuldings to this flood events. 
 I´m grateful for anyone that may be available form a 30 minutes online meeting or a email/text exchange about this topic.

                              <span>Hi me and my friends will be arriving in Hanoi on the 17th November and are looking at getting tickets for the Vietnam vs Iraq football match on the 21st, I’ve seen online to get the tickets via VinID but cannot seem to set up an account without a Vietnamese phone number. Is there any other way around this or could we get tickets on the day?

                              <span>Hello everyone, how are you doing today?
 I just want to gather people that love 3d printers in Vietnam.
 I have a subreddit r/in3dvietnam which share free 3D files and news in a daily basis, if you are interested in, feel free to join.
 Since the community is about Vietnam so maybe Vietnamese is the main language, but I could use English as well if you are a foreigner.
 Thanks and warm regards.

Who and where can I contact about this issue? And where can I check the contact information that entered?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m from Germany, East Germany to be precise. Back when Germany was divided, there were around 60,000 Vietnamese guest workers in the former GDR (soviet occupation zone). I myself was too young to experience the GDR. 
 We are always accused of racism, but when I talk to my parents, grandparents or other older people and ask them about Vietnamese people in the GDR, I only hear great acknowledgement and appreciation. Statements like &quot;good and honest people&quot;, &quot;they were very decent and hard-working&quot;, &quot;calm and level-headed&quot;, or &quot;we didn&#x27;t see them as foreigners&quot;. I have never heard anyone say anything bad about Vietnamese people. I wish I could say the same about Muslims from the MENA countries, today. I just wanted to let you know that in the past, as well as today, you are very much appreciated in Germany.

                              <span>I left Vietnam with my mom when I was a baby. My dad died drowning in the sea trying to escape a year before us. 
 I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for two weeks now and I was actually quite surprised by how much poverty there still is here. It seems that so many people are struggling and making so little money. The diet, stress, sunlight exposure seem to all contribute to the population having smaller bodies/frames and looking much older than their counter parts in the west. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;11&quot; with a muscular build and I feel like freaking captain America walking around here. 
 All this makes me very grateful for my life. But I also feel guilty because I realize everything I have was given to me. I didn&#x27;t choose to the west. I am just a product of my parents and environment. It was my mere chance that I am where I am and who I am. One little change in my past, like my mom deciding not to try to escape or getting caught escaping and I could be in saigon trying to hustle like everyone else here. 
 I am also saddened to see how much Vietnamese ppl struggle and work so hard in this ungodly humid and hot temperature. It seems like they have so few opportunities to advance and make a better life. 
 I have heard things are slowly changing though. More people are able to get higher education and the middle class is growing. I hope when I come back in ten years things will be much more different. 
 As viet kieus, do you guys feel the same gratitude and guilt as I do?

                              <span>I noticed that there are tourist restaurants and there are hole in the walls where locals eat. 
 As a viet kieu I have no problem going to a hole in the wall to order and eat. But when I go there I notice people there staring at me. And sometimes the workers have a bit of an attitude? I might just be paranoid or over thinking it. I speak Vietnamese (semi fluent) so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re annoyed that I can&#x27;t order properly. 
 What do you guys think? Am I just being paranoid or is there really a locals only vibe at some places?

 But I finally met a complete ass hat last night. White dude from Canada. He was completely wasted, chain smoking, and yelling at people around him. He kept mentioning how he came here to find a wife and how he hasn&#x27;t gotten laid at all yet. Big surprise, big fat white loud mouth hasn&#x27;t gotten laid yet. Shocking women all around the world don&#x27;t enjoy rude idiot drunk assholes. 
 God it&#x27;s embarrassing that I&#x27;m also from Canada. 🇨🇦
 What type of tourists do locals hate the most?

                              <span>My family has been traveling for 3 years and have visited many different countries both developed and undeveloped. We&#x27;re currently in Vietnam for the first time and although it&#x27;s exciting here, I&#x27;m getting tired of a few things that we&#x27;re not used to. Almost every day we have been here, the locals try scamming us. From the street sellers who give me less change money than I&#x27;m supposed to get, the &quot;take a photo with my fruit basket on a stick&quot; and then heckling you to give photo money or buy something, &quot;take a free donut&quot;, etc. It&#x27;s wearing me down as I&#x27;m a very honest person and have tried my entire adult life to support little mom and pop shops with their businesses. We just spent 2 months in korea and a week in Japan and those locals were very honest, did not heckle, and if they offered a free sample, it was really free. Plus the lack of consideration. Last night at 1:30am, there is construction still going on like a circular saw and banging metal. I wake up to it, and have to sleep with it. Does the police or other locals not care about quiet sleeping time? We have never encountered something like this on a constant basis in any other country we&#x27;ve traveled to.
 We are scheduled to leave here next week, then off to Ho Chi Mihn for a week, and then after that we had scheduled Da Nang for a whole month but now considering canceling Da Nang if it&#x27;s going to be more of the same. So for people who have traveled to Da Nang, can you tell me if we will be facing the same situation as here in Old Quarter Hanoi?
 ​
 We have met some really nice people in nice shops who offer us good service and the right change so we have been returning to those spots to eat. There&#x27;s a coconut/smoothie spot we enjoy so everyday we buy 5 drinks.

                              <span>Hi! My family and I will be travelling to Vietnam in January 2024 for a month. I was wondering what the weather is like there? We will be spending a week in HCMC, a week in Hue and some days in maybe Da Nang, Nha Trang or Da Lat. I’m getting some mixed information that it’ll be hot, maybe chilly or foggy. 
 We are from Canada so I would really like to know what I should be mindful of and pack for. TIA!

 Cảm ơn :)

                              <span>Hi all, we’re flying to Hanoi soon on Vietnam Airlines, a Boeing 787. We’ll be in regular economy.
 I’m interested in buying a Bluetooth transmitter so I can use my own noise cancelling headphones with the inflight entertainment. Does anyone know if those planes have single or double headphone Jack inputs? Can’t find the info online anywhere!
 Cheers!

 Is 1 hour 30 mins a sufficient layover time for this?

 I usually travel with &quot;Iati&quot; insurance, but it&#x27;s meant for traveling, not for longer stays. What insurance do you recommend me?

                              <span>Hi I just wanted to give an update on this poll I did a while back: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/16jlwu5/market_research_for_handbagtote_bag_fashion_start/
 ​
 I&#x27;m slowly launching the tote bags that I described in the original post. I feel a little bit embarrassed to try to push this new project out there but what do I have to lose then to share my experience right?
 I am so thankful for the people who voted in the poll and gave their opinions. It really helped me narrow down my focus. This is a passion project that stemmed from a long overdue trip to Vietnam.
 I was born in a refugee camp in Malaysia and moved to Canada when I was 4. I only been to Vietnam once when I was 14 on a family trip. Then this year back in April I decided to go back to Vietnam on my own at the age of 30. It was an incredible experience reconnecting with family and making new friends as a solo traveler who can barely speak Vietnamese. I have to say that Vietnamese locals are so open and love to connect with foreigners - I think that&#x27;s what makes the country so great!
 Anyways, I got a felt tote bag from a popular Men&#x27;s wear brand there and walked around with it in Canada, constantly getting compliments on the bag. I decided to start my own brand selling these felt tote bags with my own designs. Right now the designs and branding is focused on the soft &quot;Asian&quot; girl aesthetic but I hope to venture beyond these tote bags to explore different aspects of being Vietnamese living outside of Vietnam. I feel that we are constantly trying to connect to heritage while building a unique Western-Vietnamese experience navigating two cultures.
 I hope you guys follow The New Win on social media and check out the website: bythenewwin.com.
 As you can see the poll winner &quot;Saigon District 1&quot; inspired the first design. I&#x27;m gearing up for the first Drop soon and I hope you check back for more Drops in the future.

Do you any tips on what &amp; where we could buy some medicine? We are located near Hoan Kiem Lake. Also, some easy food places recommendations are welcomed (even though Vietnamese food is very delicious, might be smart to go easy a bit). Thanks in advance!

                              <span>So I’ve been having interviews with Vietnamese employers for a teaching job and they’ve all been lovely so far. But someone interviewed me today and she commented on the teaching demo I sent. She said “I saw your teaching demo. You were so fat there! But I see you now and you’re not fat. Did you lose weight?” and she waited for me to answer that question haha. Is this normal and should I expect more blunt comments like this? I’m not fat but I’m not skinny either. I’d say I’m midsize/curvy.

                              <span>as the title says.
 today i had a call with my mom, and apparently in my hometown parents are really worried about their kids watching weird, loud videos where soldiers brutally killing humanoid heads in giant toilets. and i immediately knew it&#x27;s the pointless &quot;skibidi toilet&quot; trend.
 this used to be a harmless thing where gamers made silly videos using a game called Garry&#x27;s Mod just to have fun with each others.
 but Vietnamese trashy creators, as they always do, now catch up with the thing and try to create the most controversy and harmful things ever, while pasting &quot;skibidi toilet&quot; into the title to trick kids into giving them more views. horrible thumbnails with real Vietnamese faces popping out of a toilet, and you call that children&#x27;s watchable contents?
 it&#x27;s sad to see how abusive Vietnamese trash content creators have become. in the past, they literally made videos like Spiderman having weird thoughts with freaking Elsa from Frozen.

                              <span>Me and my friends booked a flight to Thailand by searching through Skyscanner, booking was done through the third party Agoda platform. After a few days, we received an email that stated that our flight is changed from 12pm departure to 9pm departure from Singapore. We have activities already planned out and I feel it is unfair for them to change the timing without giving us the option to refund.
 We have tried calling them via the contact found on their website and Google maps (Call center 19001886 or send email to [19001886@vietjetair.com](mailto:19001886@vietjetair.com)) but nobody picked up, all their social media links to nowhere and we even tried visiting the office in Singapore, which is non existent (&quot;Vietjet Air Singapore Ticketing Office&quot; on Google Maps). 
 Has anyone encountered this situation before? Any advice on what we can do? (Ideally a refund)

                              <span>Hello ! I&#x27;m creating an app to train to recognize Vietnamese tones! (because I am struggling with them 😅). You can try it if you want, it&#x27;s free but it is only available on android phones for now :
 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.kayafugames.vietnamtones
 Feel free to tell me what you think. I&#x27;m wondering if the progression is not too quick - maybe I should add more levels with only two tones to choose from.
 Enjoy! :)

 https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3240554/vietnamese-decry-construction-borders-unesco-site-ha-long-bay-killing-everything
 A huge residential complex being built on the borders of Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay prompted a public outcry in the Southeast Asian country on Monday, as concerns mount over human impacts that have degraded the Unesco World Heritage site.
 The bay, famed for its brilliant turquoise waters dotted with towering rainforest-topped limestone islands, is one of Vietnam’s most popular tourist destinations, attracting more than seven million visitors last year.
 The shore and the surrounding town are already heavily developed. But on Sunday pictures were published in state media of an enormous construction site running through the waters – and next to the spectacular karsts – of Bai Tu Long Bay, which borders Ha Long.

                              <span>This is a serious question and is for discussion purposes.
 As I know, the official salary of officials is very low, even lower than workers. Even the prime minister&#x27;s salary is only around 20,000,000 VND.
 This creates the first problem: because they are the only ones who can solve problems (administrative, legal) for the people. They will create barriers to make the problem more difficult to solve. To get bribe money.
 The higher their position, the more difficult problems they can solve, and the more bribes they can get. Because these positions can all be bought with money. This environment, of course, becomes a potential market for investment.
  
Want to become a traffic policeman standing at the intersection? Money.
 Want to become president or vice president of the province? Money.

                              <span>hi! i’m planning on going to southeast asia in 2024, im seeing SO much conflicting answers on when is the best weather. Rough loose itinerary i’m thinking-
 fly into Bangkok—North Thailand—Laos—Vietnam—Cambodia—South Thailand &amp; Islands
 i want to travel down the whole country starting in the north but my main things i’m most excited for are Ha Giang Loop and Ha Long Bay private island overnight through the hostel. so want best weather for those. thank you!

                              <span>Seeking advice!!
 Background: I&#x27;m Vietnamese- born and raised in vietnam but moved to United States at very young age. I&#x27;m still able to retain the language. My girlfriend is Egyptian born and raised in Egypt, and also moved to United States at a very young age. You rarely see Vietnamese/Egyptian couples in the states...which makes our relationship very unique. Both of our culture values are very similar. Most would think that Arab are muslim...which is true but my gf and I are both christian but different domination...anyways that&#x27;s a whole different conversation of it own. My parents are very traditional. they would want me to date and marry to a Vietnamese girl. However to me, i should be able date anyone regardless of culture/race. Every time i would talk about girls outside of the culture they will give racist remarks.
 Question: How would i go about introducing my Girlfriend to my traditional Vietnamese parents without them having a prejudice mindset?

                              <span>In a recent meeting in India, billionaire Gautam Adani sat down with Pham Nhat Vuong, Chairman of Vingroup, to discuss potential business opportunities between India and Vietnam.
 During the discussion, Adani expressed his admiration for Pham Nhat Vuong&#x27;s entrepreneurial journey. He was particularly impressed by how Vuong transitioned from the instant noodle business to becoming a leading force in the production of cutting-edge electric vehicles and advanced battery solutions for global sustainable mobility. All of this was achieved in a remarkably short span of time.

                              <span>Hey! 
 I&#x27;m in Hanoi for three weeks and occasionally need to do some work. I just need a normal desk with an office chair and a monitor. I contacted some co-working spaces, which would be perfect because they charge by the day, but they don&#x27;t offer any hardware (monitor, keyboard and a mouse).
 Another option would be to go to a gaming cafe and just plug their hardware into my laptop. Has anyone done that?
 Would renting the equipment be an option? Tried googling, but only a single really expensive option came up. Buying doesn&#x27;t work as I will be traveling around Vietnam. 
 There should be quite a lot of digital nomads in Vietnam, so someone has to have dealt with the same problem. Didn&#x27;t find any on this subreddit tho.
 Thanks!
 PS! I&#x27;ll probably face the same problem in January at Da Nang, so any info on the way of the land over there would also be much appreciated.

                              <span>What would happen if Vietnam had built nuclear energy ? I heard people say it&#x27;s because geopolitics that prevented us from building nuclear with Russia&#x27;s help. But looking at how Bangladesh managed to get Russian help then I suppose it&#x27;s the government&#x27;s fault for having fallen into Western &quot;renewable energy trap&quot;. We know that only nuclear energy can support economy better than renewables. So what are your opinions ?

 The Southeast Asian electronics manufacturing hub is home to Intel&#x27;s largest factory worldwide for assembling, packaging and testing chips, and has been banking on the company further expanding there especially after Joe Biden announced deals to support Vietnam&#x27;s chips industry during a visit in September.

They&#x27;ve managed to achieve so much, fought bravely to regain independence and secured it regardless circumstances. It was You against the French, then against the Americans and their global wealth tools of oppression. Wish You all the best. My parents will be visiting Hanoi in a couple of days. Any recommendations would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi guys, I’ll be going to Vietnam for the first time and plan and going to ha long bay during one of the stops. I don’t know how to swim which I know is embarrassing and as it turns out one of the bucket list things to do is in ha long bay is kayaking. We’re doing the cruise which is fine but is kayaking something that’s recommended even for someone who can’t swim? Would I miss out on a lot if I don’t do it? My friends are okay with me just staying on the cruise and waiting but if it’s safe enough then I might give in. Any suggestions or opinions are welcome. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, I’m heading to Vietnam next week and will be visiting Ho Chi Minh City, Hoi An, Ha Long Bay, and Hanoi over the next few weeks. It’s my first time in Vietnam, and I’m excited to explore! 
 I think I’ve got a pretty solid itinerary planned, but since it’s the holiday season I’m hoping to pick up some unique souvenirs and gifts to bring back to the U.S. I found a shop in Ho Chi Minh City called OHQUAO that seems pretty great - unique paper goods/design. Wondering if there are other shops like this people would recommend I check out? I really enjoy shopping for home goods, art/decor, stuff like that.
 Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

                              <span>I&#x27;m visiting danang for a week, have already gone swimming for a few days now and the water seemed muddy but overall quite clean, until today. We were walking along My Khe beach late afternoon in the rain, and suddenly noticed parts of the water got darker， with several cockroaches washed up on shore, some live ones were crawling around that area as well. I was shocked to see the sewage overflowing into the water. Is My Khe beach clean enough to swim? Or any suggestions for other beach areas north or south of my khe that may be more clean/safe?

                              <span>How is gestational diabetes handled in vietnam? Is it something these they for? What are the glucose levels recommended to follow? 
 I’m a vietnamese American living in America and currently pregnant with our first baby. Recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have to meet glucose levels set by American medical institutes. Given that I’m ethnically Asian and grew up eating Asian food at home and maintain Việt culture at home life- I am apt to believe a lot of the American medical standards don’t fit me as I’m not the same genetic or dietary background as most of their standards which is collective studies base on the “average” white person (since white ppl make up the majority of the population in america) so was curious what vietnam did for gestational diabetes 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 My parents have extremely high triglycerides and don&#x27;t show any signs of slowing down their white carbohydrate intake. It is in the 1,000+ range. I tried to find the word in Vietnamese but i haven&#x27;t found it, and I only found words for blood pressure and cholesterol.
 How can I explain it to my parents? My viet is crap and I wasn&#x27;t able to find so many articles on it. I would also like to show them some articles/videos in Vietnamese that will support what my doctor and I agreed on, which is a lower carbohydrate diet and its benefits, and why she should not be eating so many carbohydrates (80% of diet)

 But I noticed that no one ever holds their waist/hips. Seems kind of dangerous right? What if you fall?

                              <span>In 1123–1150, Vietnam managed to repel a combined Khmer and Cham invasion. The Khmer Empire was at its peak of power at that point but it lost to Vietnam.
 In 1075-1077, the Vietnamese Ly Dynasty launched an invasion deep into Song China&#x27;s territory. They were still a small kingdom that only gained independence 100 years ago and were attacking the strongest empire on earth at the time. The Song responded by invading Vietnam but they were defeated.
 The Mongols also invaded Vietnam and were defeated in all 3 times.
 While the Ming Dynasty conquered Vietnam in 1407, they were only able to hold Vietnam for 20 years.
 In 1471, Vietnam managed to wipe out Champa, which was an enemy for over 500 years out of existence. This is akin to France wiping Spain or Germany out of existence.

 We see a post or more about Vietnamese women literally EVERY single day. So far, so good.
 Since it&#x27;s MORE than obvious what you guys want, why don&#x27;t you simply go to one of these waaaay to many happy ending massage parlors or sex workers in the first place, where you get the benefit of knowing what you&#x27;re paying for and also know HOW MUCH you&#x27;re going to pay.
 Two friends visited me once in Hanoi and they were super excited about the chance to get laid with some asian girls. They were talking about it the whole time before they even arrived. Even though i opposed that, I showed them places where they could get what they want, for no more than 1.5M.

 EDIT: ‼️he is not blood related‼️ 😫 my grandma married this man, where this man already had two other baby mama’s before my grandma. So this cousin is from this grandpa’s other baby mama’s side where he is a cousin from a mom who married into this grandpa’s family. Even though he considers my grandma also as his grandma, and also texted my mom as an auntie, and I approached him as a cousin because we got introduced as ‘yall are cousins, he is a child from your grandpas side’

                              <span>I&#x27;ve stayed at two hotels now and both were not good. They looked nothing like the pictures and even though they had good reviews, it seems like the reviews were lies. 
 The rooms were terribly small. One had no window whatsoever. The &quot;pool&quot; was like 2 feet deep. The &quot;gym&quot; was two treadmills and a bike. The construction quality of the rooms and bathrooms were shoddy. Everything felt thin and cheap. You can hear everything happening through the walls. 
 On the plus side, the staff were always extremely kind and helpful. I really loved the service. The breakfast nuggets were always good as well. 
 Both hotels were half a million dong per night. 
 Do I just need to find more expensive hotels? What&#x27;s a good budget for something decent but not extravagant? A million dongs?

                              <span>flew into Saigon last week and staying Bien Hoa for about another week(2 weeks in total in vietnam). I&#x27;ve gotten horrible cellphone service since I&#x27;ve been here. only time I&#x27;ve gotten somewhat decent service is when I&#x27;m either on a wifi connection, or when I visited Vung Tau. 
 I&#x27;m American and currently have AT&amp;T cellphone service. wishing I had picked up a Vietnamese sim card before I left the airport. I rely heavily on Google translate to understand different people here.

                              <span>Just want your thoughts on this. 
 I’ll be spending some time up North doing the Ha Giang Loop and Ha Long Bay, I have a few days left to explore Hanoi and was thinking of doing a day trip to Ninh Binh though it could be quite tiring and was thinking of if I should skip that and spend some more time exploring in Hanoi.

                              <span>I ended up getting a little lost on Google reading about people explaining the terms you would use to talk to other people in Vietnamese (chị, cậu, etc.) and I got a bit curious since I didn&#x27;t see anything about this: Is it common to address your cousins differently based on their parents&#x27; age in relation to your own parents? I will add that I am Vietnamese myself, and I call all my cousins whose parents are older than mine &quot;chị/anh&quot; (vice versa for younger and &quot;em&quot;), but is this the standard? Was curious since it does sometimes lead to me calling my cousins who are much older than me &quot;Em&quot; and my middle schooler cousins &quot;Anh&quot;, and I always found it a bit funny

                              <span>Hello, 
 I need some advice, please. I will stay in Hanoi for one and a half days, and I want to do a one-day trip. However, I&#x27;m a bit hesitant about which option to choose:
 1) Halong Bay (Route 2)
 2) Ninh Binh (Hoa Lu, Trang An, Tam Coc, Hang Mua)
 3) Bai Dinh, Trang An, Mua Cave
 Thank you so much

Does anyone know of a forum to post or search for this type of thing? I would love to connect with him. We did try emailing him thru the 23 &amp; Me site but his profile hasn&#x27;t been active in a few weeks. His name is Kevin Nguyen. Any help would be great!

 Anyone has or knows these scenarios? Does it sound scammy to y’all or I’m overthinking 😂
 Edit: they have the same career: “shareholder of my aunt’s business. And none of them had verified profile

We have been asked for a picture by the owners for a pic of just us ( we thought maybe to put on their website or something like that ) but then also by someone in the bar who just wanted a selfie. This is our first time in Vietnam and just would like to know why. We dont care we laughed and also asked for a picture with them too just wanted some idea as to why. To preface we are very white with pale skin and from Liverpool which we did tell them- not sure if this is a reason but let us know if so !

 Seems like this is especially true in Saigon. Is it the pollution? The constant hustle of city life? The cigarette smoking? The beer consumption? Poor quality of food? 
 In phu quoc, I notice ppl look a bit younger and overall happier.

But they been meeting each other every weekend for like ever to sing karaoke and drink. This is just one prime examples of many I&#x27;ve encountered. If he is tired, then he should say he needs a time off.

                              <span>Something I have noticed during my time in Vietnam is that in many of the stores, restaurants etc you go into (generally the more expensive ones) the staff give the ‘hello sir’ and then just sort of stand right near you and watch, as you browse, as you decide, as you calculate cash for the bill etc. I’ve even had it where there are multiple workers stood looking at me. I find it incredibly off-putting and it usually just makes me want to leave immediately as I feel under pressure.
 Has anybody else noticed this phenomena? Is it normal?

                              <span>From my many years of travelling, visiting all of Southeast Asia except Laos and Myanmar, East Asia and India, it&#x27;s my first time an airport staff aggressively shouted at me. 
 After the Immigration, the guy who checks your passport and boarding pass in the final security check, alerted me that there&#x27;s an issue with my check-in baggage. He told me to wait in the waiting area. I was very nervous since it&#x27;s the first time that my baggage was questioned. And I kept thinking of worst case scenario like finding illegal items and being fined etc. I was waiting for a few minutes and asked politely (saying &quot;Sir&quot;) and he said that the staff from the airline is arriving. There&#x27;s no one at the security screening at that point and after several minutes, asked him politely again, and then he shouted in a loud aggressive voice &quot;I TOLD YOU TO WAIT HUH. WAIT!! &quot; and I was shocked by that aproach. Even his fellow staff looked at him. 
 I was shaken by his aggressive reply and just sat in my seat while he just turned his back at me. Fortunately, the airline staff arrived and accompanied me at the baggage screening. It was a pocket wifi and it&#x27;s carry on only. After clearing, I went to other side of security and went to boarding gates.
 (Also earlier, the lady at the check-in counter seems very testy, the way she processed the check-in procedures) 
 The staff at Saigon Airport seems to be in a lot of stress and not very friendly. I really had a bad experience on this Airport and it made a pretty bad impression as a visitor, , unlike the ones in Hanoi and Da Nang.. Honestly, from the attitude of staff and the whole airport experience (queueing, check-in), it&#x27;s much worse than the comparable NAIA (Manila) T3. Next time, I will choose Da Nang or Hanoi Airport.

                              <span>hi! am heading to Da Nang in a couple of days and want to surprise my partner for our anniversary by bringing them to a nice dinner at a restaurant in Da Nang.
 was hoping that i could perhaps get a nice list of dinner places that are a bit more romantic.
 we don’t have any cuisine preferences, but maybe not chinese food? (because we have a LOT of that from where we’re from haha)
 i’m a student, so my budget is about $40-50 usd for us both. 
 thanks so much in advance! :)

 I’m reading about Vietnamese History and I’m wondering if Crown Prince Nguyễn Phúc Bảo Long had a son before he died in 2007. If not, does this mean the royal family in exile no longer has a successor anymore? 
 Thank you very much. 🙏🙏🙏

                              <span>Hello all,
 Looking for some input and if I should remove or add any days anywhere in particular and if I&#x27;m missing something. I&#x27;m a medium paced traveller, don&#x27;t take things too slow but neither rush through the trip. 
 I&#x27;m into cozy hotels (not too expensive), historical sites &amp; museums, local food, drinks &amp; coffee places. I&#x27;m not a nightlife person and usually stay away from crazy spots - doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t like to visit and see them for a couple hours. I want to make the best out of my Vietnam trip. 
 I&#x27;m planning the following route in my Vietnam trip for so many days:
 Hanoi 4
 Ha Long Bay 2 (Here I plan a one night trip where they come pick you up from hotel and return you the next day - any agency you&#x27;d recommend? looking at prices online I expect around 350 euro pp)
 Ninh Binh 2 (Saw that can be done as a day trip but many people recommend spending the night)
 Sapa 3 (Here is the most uncertain part of the trip, not sure if worth spending the 6 hours of train/bus to reach here, stay 1 full day, and return the 3rd day - any experiences on how to proceed best?) 
 Hanoi 1 (coming back from Sapa and prepare for flight to Da Nang)
 Da Nang/Hue/Hoi An 5 (any idea how many days I should spend in each? I&#x27;m reading that Hoi An would be the best out of these 3 cities so I don&#x27;t mind cutting 1 city to spend more time in Hoi An) 
 HCMC 3 
 Phu quoc/ Con Dao 4 (I still have to decide which of the islands I should go to - price wise flight from HCMC is similar but I&#x27;m reading plenty of negative stuff on Phu Q so I&#x27;m leaning more towards Con Dao).

 Em đang thấy mình như vậy. Em mới sinh em bé được vài tháng. Bố của em bé nói thẳng ra là một thằng hèn, không gửi phí sinh hoạt cho em bé từ lúc em bầu tới giờ, và cậu ta luôn trách móc em đủ thứ và cậu ta không ưa thái độ của em. Và từ lúc em bầu tới giờ cậu ta cũng chưa một lần hỏi thăm đến sức khoẻ của em chứ đừng nói là gửi phí sinh hoạt. Nhưng mà vấn đề chính k phải chuyện này, mở đầu câu chuyện em phải chì chiết sỉ vả thằng chó đó 1000 lần em mới vừa lòng, đó là thói quen của em mong mọi người thông cảm, em đang cố healing để bỏ chuyện đó ra khỏi đầu.

 Is that enough time for things to be delivered? How long does it usually take/which one is faster? Is there any way to find sellers from hcmc? Or are there places which can sell at similar prices in hcmc
 Sorry for way too many questions

 ​
  
Somewhere scenic, my mom can take a thousand of pics 
 Some activities to do? Or even a tour in the area to learn about the cultures / history
 Food! We love food 
  
​
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: looking to visiting mid - end of Feb / early March!

 I am looking for some advice. I come from the UK and for Christmas I would like to get my partner a Vietnamese food themed hamper. He has absolutely fallen in love with the food and culture, so I wanted to get him something special for Christmas. So far in the hamper is a cookbook, personalised chopsticks, nuoc chan sauce. All these I can source quite easily in the UK. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Perhaps some traditional drinks or snacks? And if so, ideas of where I can buy them?
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>Hi! I am looking for a small village accessible by bus from Hanoi within 3 hours max that would have beautiful scenery, nice cooler weather and off the beaten path. I am open to more touristy options if they are really nice. I plan on doing a writing retreat and want as less distraction as possible, but would look forward for some nice mountain scenery or old village charm that i could easily stroll through on foot or bike. Thanks!

                              <span>Saw these signs all over North Vietnam in public restrooms in touristy places like Ha Long Bay, Ninh Binh, etc. Anyone know where I can buy some to bring back to the states? I&#x27;d love to put one up in the bathroom at my job 😄. I&#x27;m staying in Hanoi Old Quarter for 1 more day before I go back to HCMC, if anyone knows of any aluminum sign shops. Thanks!

                              <span>I’m in love with Da Nang, it’s beaches, it’s food - through pictures. I’ve also read about its amazing local and digital nomad community. 
 What would you say the weather is like from early December to early Jan in Da Nang? 
 Too wet and best to try another time? Or not too wet and it’s worth staying a month starting early December? 
 I’m keen to surf, spend time by the beach, walk by the beach.

 Which hotel would you recommend?

                              <span>I&#x27;m Việt Kiều and live in the west. I&#x27;ve noticed that most Vietnamese people have single syllable first names (Phuong, Linh, Huy, etc), but the few kids born here I&#x27;ve seen with two syllable first names, it starts with My, followed by another name - &quot;My ___&quot; For example: My Ha, My Tam, etc. I was wondering if this was a common type of name or sounded &#x27;natural&#x27; as I wanted to name some Vietnamese characters for something I&#x27;m writing.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m thinking about traveling to Vietnam in June. I come from an asian country that always uses a bidet and honestly I&#x27;m not comfortable using anything else.
 Is it the norm to use a bidet? Or is toilet paper a more common method? I was just wondering about the hotels and public washrooms. 
 If someone could help me out, i would really appreciate it.

                              <span>First question is about how much I should be spending on good street food. I just bought a banh Mỹ with chicken and egg for 55,000 from a little corner shop. Good deal?
 Second question is about protein drinks. In Thailand there was a 7 Eleven every few steps, and they all sold various protein drinks. The Circle K I just went into had none. How can I procure protein drinks without buying a huge tub?
 Thanks everyone!

                              <span>After overstaying by 2 days and paying a 1.25 million fine at the airport, I received a passport stamp allowing me to stay until November 4, 2023. What are my chances of obtaining an e-visa after this?

                              <span>My friend told me that in Vietnam there&#x27;s a law where if you&#x27;re in a car accident and at-fault, you have to pay the hospital bills of the person you injured. So apparently when someone gets hit, the driver will often turn around and try to &quot;finish him/her off&quot; since it&#x27;s cheaper to pay for their funeral than all their medical expenses. 
 Is this true? Can someone link an article(s) where this actually took place. Sounds plausible yet comical.

                              <span>Cơ quan CSĐT (Công an TP.HCM) đã tống đạt quyết định khởi tố vụ án, khởi tố bị can và thi hành lệnh bắt tạm giam đối với nguyên phó khoa trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân vì mua dâm người dưới 18 tuổi.
 Một nguồn thông tin cho hay, Cơ quan CSĐT (Công an TP.HCM) vừa tống đạt các quyết định khởi tố vụ án, khởi tố bị can và thi hành lệnh bắt tạm giam đối với ông P.V.H. (47 tuổi, ngụ TP.Thủ Đức) về hành vi “Mua dâm người dưới 18 tuổi”.
 Các quyết định và lệnh trên đã được Viện KSND cùng cấp phê chuẩn.
 Ông P.V.H. đã bị tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân. Ông này từng mang cấp hàm Thượng tá, nguyên là phó khoa của trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân, trụ sở ở TP.HCM.
 Bước đầu, ông P. đã thừa nhận có hành vi mua bán dâm đối với bé gái 15 tuổi.
 Ngày 3/11, trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân đã có thông báo gửi đến công an các đơn vị, một số địa phương, học viện, trường, bệnh viện CAND về việc kỷ luật cán bộ. 
 Theo thông báo, vị phó khoa này bị kỷ luật bằng hình thức “tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân” từ ngày 1/11.
 Vụ án đang được Cơ quan CSĐT Công an TP.HCM mở rộng điều tra.

                              <span>Hi,
 We are flying out of Ho Chi Min on the 3rd of Jan late in the day so we were hoping to spend new years somewhere else, maybe Phu Quoc or does anyone have any other recommendations for South Vietnam? We don&#x27;t want to be stuck on the streets with millions of people so either a big beach style party or something really elegant maybe, a resort with events would work also but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything specific.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never been required to take one after being here some time. But a memo went out where I work that it would be required next year (I think nationally it already is, but whatever....) Anyway, my BMI is very low even for Vietnamese standards 44-45 kg at 170 cm. I&#x27;m a man. Otherwise healthy although I have had my blood pressure tested in the moderate to high zone at times, although other times it was normal. Not sure if I had nerves at the exam, but it has come out high in some exams. Not sure if I have any other issues. I can teach 12 hours straight if necessary, not sure why we need a confirmation of what can be seen, but what could get my visa not renewed? Thanks!

                              <span>After the last point, I am concerned as I am flying to Ho Chi Minh and later will be flying to Hanoi from the same airport.
 Do you have any advice for someone coming here for the first time? Such as things not to do, things to watch out for, or if I need to get to the airport earlier?

                              <span>Was wondering if an artist named &quot;Pham Chinh Trung&quot; is famous in Vietnam for his lacquer work?
 Received a pen made by him (or has his brand at least) as a gift and it is really nice. I would like to study and purchase more lacquer products while I am in Vietnam next week. 
 Also if there is any other recommendations regarding son mai, I&#x27;m all ears. Really looking for the good stuff though, not street knock offs.

I don&#x27;t know exactly how impactful is the recession on the lives of most people, but I heard some ppl say it is probably worse than on TV because there&#x27;s more job layoffs. Just curious, how impactful is it ?

                              <span>Yesterday I received a call informing me that the train I was traveling on SP3 had been cancelled, and my ticket would now be changed to SP1. I also received a text message, and I had no suspicion at the time.
 Just now, someone called me and asked me where I was. He said he would meet me at the Hanoi station and put me on the train. I thought to myself: The service of Vietnam Railway is really good.
 After I entered Hanoi Station, I found that the sp3 train had not been cancelled. There were many people in the train, and I could tell at a glance that they were also tourists. At the same time, I saw the person who called me. He was wearing a &quot;xx travel&quot; T-shirt but not the blue uniform of the Vietnam Railway . He put me on the train and told me he was sorry. I think I roughly understood it, and I didn&#x27;t expose him. I didn&#x27;t suffer any loss, and I knew that he was just an ordinary office worker who just wanted to complete his work.
 I guess maybe more people joined the tour group, but they didn’t have enough train tickets, so they randomly selected a few lucky passengers like us and lied to them. This should be something that tour groups operate and Vietnam Railways acquiesces to.

                              <span>I’ve only ever been to Phu Quoc twice and both times I am convinced I flew later in the evening, around 9pm the first time and then 11pm the next. Getting the later flights allowed me to return home from work to collect luggage and then be on the island in good time. 
 However more recently I wanted to go back and found myself completely unable to find any flight that flies after 6.45pm. I checked multiple airlines, even seeing if booking a month or two made any difference. I couldn’t find anything. 
 Anyone got any idea what the hell is happening?

 Go to a karaoke room, shut it down by 10.
 It always happens to be the worst fucking singers in history.
 Sorry Vietnam you need to break this fucking shit culture asap. I have never hated something from this country more. Or any country for that matter.
 Singing the shittiest wannabe country/folk/traditional bullshit ever. Thinking theyre Celine Deon or some shit. 
 This damn family has been singing the same bullshit drunk for hours, its taking everything i have not to go start yelling at them. Now they have people come over and play their instruments also and they are horrible beyond horrible 
 If i was a Viet I dont think i could hold back on them

                              <span>I’m currently in hcmc and it’s my first week in Vietnam so excuse my lack of cultural wit.
 Today I was trying to park my bike and a random looking guy showed up. He started scribbling something on a piece of paper so I assumed he wanted to charge me for the parking. I told him to show me some kind of ID but he wouldn’t so I told him to get lost and just left the bike there. On my way back I realised he’s moved the bike to the middle of the road. I’ve got a few questions:
  
Do these people charge money for parking?
 
If so, on what basis? Like, do they own the parking spaces?
 
If they do charge, do I just trust any random looking dude here and hand them in my money?
 
What is his job exactly, how does anyone benefit from his services?
 
 Also I do apologise if I just broke some social standards. The only similar experience I’ve had was in Naples where local drug addicts demand money for parking, and I’ve been advised by my Italian friend to just ignore them. I would really like to know how to deal with this here in Vietnam.

                              <span>As someone from the Philippines, I know that the sub has some strong opinions for Korean, Chinese and Indian tourists. So, it made me think, what do the Vietnamese thinks of fellow SEasians? In my 8 days in Vietnam, I only noticed a handful of them. Most are Koreans and Indians. 
 As a Filipino, I was surprised that we&#x27;re the biggest spenders in Vietnam. I was also mistaken for a Thai a lot. It seems that Thai tourists frequent Vietnam.

                              <span>I think you guys could relate to this.
 Growing we’ve all probably heard some variation of this. Where your parents would stop you from misbehaving by saying “oh if you don’t do this, a cop will arrest you” or “if you don’t stop doing this, that man over there will kidnapped you”.
 I thought that that kind of parenting was something that is long gone by time our generation came around. 
 But lo and behold, just this evening while I was enjoying a drink a mother near me was trying to get her daughter to eat. Now I wasn’t paying attention because it wasn’t my business… until the mother looks over at me and said “if you don’t eat that man will kidnapped you”. I was the only other customer there so I knew for a fact she was talking about me.
 And I just… didn’t know what to do or say, I just look over at them surprise for a few second while she continue, saying how I’m gonna do it and where I’ll take her
 I paid and left pretty quickly after that but how do you responded to something like that? WHY are we still doing something like that?!

                              <span>As of October 31, 2023. Prime Video became unavailable to Vietnam users. Refund will be sent to subscribers. 
  
&quot;Unplugging Prime Video: The What and The Why Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming arm, has been a part of Vietnam’s digital entertainment spectrum since 2016. The service, akin to Netflix, brought a plethora of international films and TV shows to Vietnamese screens. But come October 2023, active subscriptions will be cancelled, and full refunds will be issued. Additionally, Prime Gaming benefits will also become inaccessible.
  
While Amazon remains silent on the rationale behind this closure, industry insiders speculate Vietnamese regulations may hold the key. The country mandates transnational paid broadcasting services to obtain licenses—a hurdle that Amazon seems unwilling to surmount. However, this is merely conjecture in the absence of an official explanation.&quot;

                              <span>This should be part of the train culture, but it’s a pity that I don’t have time to experience it myself. 
 I took the train from Saigon to Nam Dinh. When I arrived in Da Nang, the song &quot;Đà Nẵng trong tim tôi&quot; was played on the train. So what song will be played on the train when I arrive in Hanoi or Saigon?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I’m on cat ba island from 16th until 20th and I need a strong and secure WiFi connection to try and get tickets to a festival that usually sells out very quickly (Glastonbury festival). 
 It looks like the hostel we are staying in has poor WiFi, so does anyone know the best spots for strong WiFi on the island? Any good hotels or internet cafes? We’re thinking of checking into an Airbnb with private WiFi on the final night just to see if it’ll help our chances of getting a ticket. 
 Any advice welcome! Thank you.

 I have emailed 19001166@bambooairways.com and it wasn&#x27;t even replying at all.
 Anyone facing the same issue?
 I&#x27;m in Saigon but their head office is permanently closed. I&#x27;m left with no other options at all.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m a European guy who recently travelled in Vietnam for a month.
 On one day I decided to travel on my motorbike to a nearby town that wasn&#x27;t touristy at all, because I wanted to see more of the real Vietnamese life.
 I ended up sitting in a cafe with a Vietnamese stranger. We drank coffee, smoked, talked through translate and had fun. I&#x27;m 19, he&#x27;s 27 with a young child if that matters.
 We ended up meeting again, travelling around and he showed me some sights. At the end of the day he insisted I slept at his house. Here I sat with him and his younger brother, we talked and eventually I went to sleep.
 Next day, I have to leave early to book a bus. My Vietnamese friend/host also had to leave early. When I was about to leave I saw a woman and I asked him if that&#x27;s his mom. He said yes.
 I told him I wanted to go thank her for letting me stay at her house. He declined. I insisted. He declined again, he seemed to really not want me to do that.
 His mom, who seemed to me doing some chores, didn&#x27;t acknowledge me at all, not even look at me.
 I found this super weird. Why was this the case?
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is a personal thing or could have to do with Vietnamese culture. Maybe I did something wrong. If it has to do with culture, do you know why this happened?

                              <span>Hello Vietnamese friends, I am from New Delhi India and I visited Vietnam for the first time, this was my second international trip and it changed the way I look at life. I stayed 2 nights in Ha-long bay and four nights in Hanoi old quarter. The people of your country are some of the warmest people I have met in my life, your roads are so clean, and even though you feel you will be run over people coolly navigate around you. No one is rude to you on the other hand I was helped by locals from falling into a tourist trap, every country had good and bad people. The majority of your country had great people with big hearts. You don’t disrespect neither do you have a demeanor where someone can try to undermine or disrespect you, maybe the years of war and made you so strong yet so humble. Money is the basis of all economies yet in your country, majority folk don’t give it the importance it’s given the world over. Food was so fresh and the amount of fruits you eat and the fresh seafood shows on your flawless skins. The women take the cake in hard work and yet manage to look so elegant in whatever they wear, they are such boss ladies it’s commendable. There are other countries in South Asia which have built economies on sex work, yet yours keeps its head held high and aims to give a more wholesome experience to any visitor.
 I write this from my bed in India, sad and depressed at having come back from such a lovely country which I wish was like my second home!
 Thank you Vietnam 🇻🇳 🙏🏻

                              <span>Chào các bạn,
 tớ là một người nước ngoài mới tốt nghiệp trường học và đi đến Việt Nam để học tiếng Việt. Hàng ngày tớ nghe nhạc nhưng tớ chưa biết nhiều ban nhạc hay ca sĩ ở Việt Nam. Tớ suy nghĩ nghe bài hát Việt Nam một cách hiệu quả để cải thiện tiếng việt của tớ. Tớ thường thích nghe Rock, Jazz hay Rock Pop. Tớ đặc biệt thích &quot;City Pop&quot;, một loại nhạc Nhật. Tớ muốn hỏi các bạn thể giới thiệu cho tớ một số ban nhạc Việt Nam giống kiểu Rock, Jazz hay City Pop, nhưng nhạc Việt Nam nà cũng được. (xin lỗi nếu Post này có nhiều lỗi, tớ chưa học tiếng Việt lâu :)))

                              <span>Yoshitaka Shindo&#x27;s local company built a new building in 2017 for Vietnamese technical interns, with an average bedroom size of 3.1 m2 per person. It was pointed out that this building did not meet JITCO regulations even before it was built, but this company stated that this was not a problem because Vietnamese people live in worse conditions in their home countries. But the regulation that the minimum bedroom size per person should be 4.5 m2 on average was established. In response to this issue this company made a donation of 4 million to Yoshitaka Shindo. As a result, this rule was changed and the aforementioned building is no longer in violation.

                              <span>I never like taking taxis anyway, I usually use Grab but my mom is a little more old-fashioned so whenever I’m traveling with her at the Tan Son Nhat airport she insists on using a taxi. She is Native Viet and I am Việt kiều. 
 First time, they scammed us to pay double/triple a normal fare price (and I know taxis to and from airport are already higher end, so it was double that price already). 
 Second time I gave them the hotel address, which was a chain hotel. Dude didn’t want to drive across town and said this particular chain accepts any reservation at any of their locations so he dropped us off at the hotel chain spot close to the hotel. I was already suspicious when he said this, but my mom accepted it readily and didn’t argue. She’s been living in Vietnam for over two years now for retirement and also grew up here, so if she thought it was fine I wasn’t going to argue either, especially since I was exhausted from a long flight. Obviously it turned out not to be true and the hotel receptionist said as much and called us a cab to our actual hotel reservation. 
 Even after these two incidents my mom still goes to the taxis when leaving the airport as she says there are no other options. However, to book a Grab car to pickup from airport you just have to walk to the airport parking lot and they’ll pick you up from there. She struggles with technology and apps though and still feels more comfortable using the taxis even knowing they’re overpriced and scammy. But for anyone who’s comfortable with using apps and booking a Grab, go for that option. Teach the older folk how to use it too. These taxis are atrocious.

 I know there’s lots of similar gates in Hanoi but does anyone know this specific one? I’ve tried reverse image searching but the descriptions are all a bit vague. Thanks!

                              <span>As a Viet, having been traveled to many countries, I have never experienced anything as unprofessional and exudes as bad energy as this place. It’s one the greatest embarrassment this country has to offer. Custom and Border officers truly brought great shame. One dude looks like he’s day drunk, the other officer cleared 3-4 people while he cleared only one. Elderly people and crying babies standing in line for hours. Every officers look visibly pissed off. What a great way to welcome foreigners to our country. This officer got my blood boiling when he physically push a Japanese tourist back in line, the tourist was simply chatting with his group because they have to wait 2 hours in line. He later show extreme irritation to the dude, slam his passport on the table in a rude manner. The Japanese tourist was in shock. Godd!!! It pissed me off everytime I land in this god forsaken ass place. Not to mention getting a taxi out of the airport. It’s extremely chaotic, unorganized, and everything is in disorder with no clear direction. Im amazed people still visit this country. Because that is some of the shittiest welcome any country could ever give.

My mother and some of my co-worker shows disdain towards them for whatever reason? When I probed my mom about it, the reason she stated for hating Indians is that they’re “stinky” and that “they are all thieves”, which I kinda don’t buy that line of reasoning. Anyone else experience similar things or do I just happen to live around particularly racists folks?
 Edit: thank you all for the replies, reading them was very…. enlightening. Needless to say, I think I’ve been rather naive with my ways of thinking thus far, thank you all for informing me.

                              <span>I&#x27;m presently dating a Vietnamese woman. We&#x27;ve gone on multiple dates, she&#x27;s spent the night at my place, but there hasn&#x27;t been any intimacy. I gave her flowers on 10-20, and we&#x27;re affectionate in public, and when it’s just the two of us but when I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said she wants to see where our relationship is headed. I&#x27;m really confused after everything we&#x27;ve shared. Should I run for the door?

                              <span>EDIT: I am leaving. Perhaps with a different company, or if there were a different demographic of people in my tour group, I would have stuck it out, but my gut is telling me to leave. Some odd things have happened that are not just related to the party culture. These people are racist. Guys, always trust your gut.
 Hi all, I (20F, poc) scheduled a Ha Giang easy rider loop tour through a hostel after all the rave reviews online. I arrive, and quickly realize that this is all just one big excuse for young white European people to drink and party. I felt extremely uncomfortable my first night here, before the tour starts, as I did not come to Vietnam to drink with strangers, don’t like these people in my group, and am uninterested in the tourist drinking and partying scene. I don’t know why I didn’t do better research to see what a terrible tourist trap Ha Giang has become. I wanted a beautiful nature motorbike tour, but I am thinking of canceling because I don’t want to drink and don’t want to be the only person of color in the group, already half-excluded.
 Has anyone felt the same way when visiting Southeast Asia, and how did you avoid this? I’m here to travel solo, decompress, enjoy nature and different cities and locals, not interested in making friends with other tourists.
 And now, I’m not sure what to do. Is the loop still worth it if I don’t want to party at night and just feel uncomfortable with the people in my group? I’m thinking of just bailing and going back to Hanoi, which I loved.

 Also is there anywhere i can go to get shirts of local clubs? 
 Thanks to anyone who reply!

I&#x27;m a huge foodie, but I also want to know of some must see destinations there. I&#x27;m staying for a period of 3 months, so please let me know all there is to see. I&#x27;ll probably be in Hanoi for my 22nd birthday. Thank you!

                              <span>Does anyone have experience getting sertraline from a pharmacy or doctor? If so, what did it cost? I’m a foreigner and have a prescription from outside Vietnam. It appears easy to get here but the two pharmacies I asked quoted almost 20,000 per 50 mg pill, which is very high.

                              <span>Hello!! My husband and I are traveling to Vietnam for the first time, specifically to Hanoi, during the first few days in December.
 How is the weather in Hanoi typically during this time of year? We are from New York City so we see all types of weather.
 Will it be cold and rainy? Or mild temps? We are going to Hong Kong after so we are trying to gauge what and how to pack.
 Thank you!

 Hôm nay tôi đáp máy bay đến Hà Nội quá giờ trưa với cái bụng đói cồn cào. Tôi nhờ tài xế chở đến một quán bún chả ngon. Và anh ấy đưa tôi đến quán có tên là Đắc Kim, tôi thấy quán có treo bảng hiệu lớn là lọt top Michelin Guide vừa rồi. Tôi hào hứng dùng thử và đúng là hương vị rất ngon.
 Tôi ngồi ngay đối diện chủ quán và nhìn mọi người chuẩn bị các nguyên liệu. Giữa tầm mắt của tôi và chủ quán là một cô lớn tuổi, tóc bạc, tôi nghĩ cũng gần 70. Khi đó tôi đang đưa máy lên để quay lại cảnh mọi người thao tác, vì tôi vốn rất thích nhìn những người lớn tuổi mà vẫn hăng say làm việc. Giữa chừng thì tôi bất giác nghe thấy người chủ quán la hét vào mặt của người làm công lớn tuổi đó bằng những lời lẽ mà tôi tưởng tượng chỉ có trong phim ảnh Việt Nam th…</span>

                              <span>We’ve all heard of those family feuds over property, right? Well me and my mom thought about it and we’d like to avoid just that in the future. 
 Backstory: my mom is Vietnamese but lives in Sweden. Her brother is holding either half (or on the contract, currently holding) her house for her until she retires and moves there in the future. Now grown up and having seen my family members patterns, I’m almost too sure that a conflict will arise in the future from this. Mainly between my moms brother, and his wife. The two aren’t too fond of each other. Another red flag I noticed during a trip to VN one summer was that my uncle started tearing up and making a whole scene in front of everyone when my mom just calmly asked for her name to also be included on the papers for the house. He was screaming about being accused of being greedy when no one approached it that way. I felt like he was scared and projecting. 
 Any advice is appreciated. I’d hate to see my family members fight over four walls in the future. 
 PS. This property was gifted to specifically my mom from her parents. My grandparents made sure each one of their kids got a retirement property.

                              <span>Hello! I have a question. I work at a garment factory in Vietnam. How can I retail my products to customers in the United States? My products include khaki pants, dress shirts, and more. I have looked into Amazon, but I noticed that they already sell similar basic items directly, and their fees seem quite high, around 40%. Can anyone provide me with some suggestions?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t assume a rational explanation for this question exists, but why are there so many adults who ride around on their motorcycles while their child is sitting on the back with their head exposed to the whatever could happen on these mean streets of VN. 
 Parents &quot;protect&quot; their own heads but not their own childrens. Yesterday during a massive downpour of rain, a father sat comfortably in his helmet and raincoat while his daughter sat on the back, cold, wet and at risk of head injury should they crash.
 At least for me, if there is only one helmet, my passenger gets it. 
 if there is one raincoat and we can&#x27;t share, my passenger gets it. 
 I honestly can&#x27;t imagine a world where you love your children but won&#x27;t sacrifice a helmet or raincoat for them.

                              <span>Title. I just want to see the price ranges for a certain area and I am wondering if there are any sites other than fb groups or chotot to search for such things? 
 Side question: is it a good time to buy farm land now? if not, when should I look out for better prices? pre-tet? 
 context: yes im a foreigner but my viet wife gonna do the buying and paperwork. purchase of farmland is not for making money but to convert it to personal use

She is a bit unfamiliar with food allergies because they aren&#x27;t that common there I have found out. Does anyone have any tips or specific restaurants that can handle nut and shellfish allergies? I should not that I am not allergic to fish sauce or peanuts, specifically shellfish and tree nuts.

                              <span>Where is the best place to play pick up basketball in Ho Chi Minh City?
 I&#x27;ve tried Phu Tho in District 10 and it was great the 1st time but then the 2nd time some lady said I had to rent it out just to shoot around on a court that was empty and dark with no lighting. 
 There&#x27;s another court called Seventy Seven and that one was pretty cool but it looked more of a &quot;friends getting together and pitching in to play&quot; type of deal. It didn&#x27;t have a very &quot;pick up&quot; style feel to it at all. 
 There is a gymnasium in District 3 and you need to rent that one out as well. Apparently, the Ho Chi Minh City Wings play at this location. 
 I haven&#x27;t even looked at District 1 yet, but I&#x27;m starting to kind of feel you need to rent a whole court out to get anything going.
 Maybe we can get a group going of at least 10 of us getting together to rent a court out together. I&#x27;m just trying to run 5 vs 5 for an hour or so to get a good work out in. 
 I&#x27;m going to try Phu Tho again because today might have just been a wierd off day as last time I was there, it actually felt like a normal park where people just rolled up and started playing pick up.
 I know basketball is not very big in Vietnam but for a developing city with 9 million people in it, I expected more out of the basketball community.

                              <span>For context, I randomly saw a video (fb) inwhich a guy (called Bino) was shocked when he saw a customer make $21k monthly. And here go the comments.
 The first one: &quot;it is normal in America for ppl to makes 6 figures annually&quot;
 The second one: &quot;my ex make $100k monthly&quot; lol wtf
 From what I&#x27;ve heard, the medium-high salary for a Vietnamese person and an American are $1000 and $4000, respectively, but I might be wrong. I just curious what the average income in Vietnam and in big cities (in Vietnam) is.

Paypal and payoneer is a no since they are too unreliable and the fee is horrendous.

                              <span>I share the same sentiment. And I was born and raised in Vietnam. Every once in a while you run into someone who’s kinda old, but not that old, and you don’t know if you should call them anh or chú. 
 Same with the women: idk if they’re old enough for me to call them cô or chị without offending them
 Edit: Just remembered something else about pronouns so figured I’ll blow y’all mind. 
 Within the family tree of Vietnam, you call your cousins anh/chị/em, not based on age but based on your parents age. In other words, if my father has a younger brother, and they both have children, my uncle’s kid would have to call me anh/chị regardless of age. This means it is possible that I am anh/chị even if I’m the younger cousin!!
 Another thing is if within a family tree, a person is on the same generation as your parents, you call them cô/dì/chú/bác. So for a large family with 1st generation of 5, it is possible to have some people of the 2nd generation younger than some people in the 3rd generation!! But the people in the 3rd generation still have to call the 2nd gen people cô dì chú bác cậu mợ, regardless of age
