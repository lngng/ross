But what about other banks? It would be nice to know so I can open another account in order to withdraw money later over there. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this might be a stretch but there was a movie my grandmother used to play for me during my childhood. 
 It involved a child and his greedy father. There was a phoenix who flew both to grab goods from a nearby island (I think gold and starfruit) but the father grabbed too much gold and weighed the phoenix down while flying on its back. 
 The phoenix looked animatronic if this helps :(. I imagine there’s a ton of versions of this since it’s a popular folklore. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I lived in Da Nang for a couple of years but since I was working I didn't get the chance to travel all that much. I'll be returning with my partner for the month of February and we're wondering if there's a unique/fun way to travel from Hanoi to Da Nang that involves seeing some sights along the way. Or, alternatively, if it's worth just flying instead to cut the duration of the trip. We'd like to see Ninh Binh but my understanding is that we could do that in a day or two from Hanoi and then return and fly out to Da Nang. 
 Any insight appreciated! Thanks very much.

 For a couple of reasons, it’s faster for the employees to make, and I like my coffee black. Anywho, the coffee only cost 12k. I noticed, that the first few times I had ordered my coffee, some of the clerks would fill it a little less than half of the cup. Now! That I have consistently go there everyday, I get the best coffee around town. O don’t even need to tell them my order, instead the clerk would automatically ask me, “black? No ice, no sugar?” I love it! Plus, this time comes around there’s this clerk that just doesn’t care about the amount he gives me. The dude fills it to the brink. Kudos to him! Let me know if this hack works for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I've been living in Vietnam for a while now, and this is something that's started to grate on me a bit.
 Most of the vietnamese teachers that I have gone out to eat with, have invited to my house, sang karaoke with, and thought I'd gotten friendlier with, still call me just "teacher" even though I've long since told them they can just call me by my name unless in front of students in which case they can call me "Teacher _____". I also always call them by their name or nickname, unless it's someone I'm not that familiar with.
 ​
 It's kind of like insisting on calling someone "Doctor" or "Sir" after they've already allowed you to call them by name, like they want to keep the relationship distant to less than acquaintances, which is fine if that's what they want, I won't have to join their drinking sessions anymore haha.
 ​
 Is this normal in vietnam? I have a vietnamese friend that says in their language they just call each other by name, but when I discuss it with the teachers they say they are just being "polite" in their culture. I even told them I prefer to be called by my name and they still say, "hello Teacher."

Which one should I choose, and why?
 I am interested in seeing anything old and interesting (old buildings, temples, markets). If there is a mountain nearby I can go to that's a plus. Nicer weather (this will be in February). Good eating (cheap street food?). Which of the two cities is cleaner, less crazy driving and/or street congestion (human).
 I'm not interested in bars, romance or shopping.

Neither of us have a motorbike license or any experience with bikes so we’d have to ride pillion and it is a bit pricey ($400 USD).
 Has anyone done these types of tours before and is it worth it?? It seems like a really amazing way to see the country but we’re torn of whether if it’s the best use of time/money.

 Tried calling and emailing all official Vietnamese embassy/consulates with no results. Nobody every picks up the phone, voicemail boxes are full and won’t accept messages. Emails to all public addresses haven’t been responded too. 
 Probably tried calling 50+ times throughout the last 3 weeks. Sent 15+ emails to the various consulates and the embassy.
 Absolutely no response from any officials. This is super frustrating…
 She has no living relatives in HCMC to help with the local authorities.
 Any suggestions on what else to try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 
 8 days ago, I began catching online predators in Vietnam. I have 3 catches already. Yesterday, I caught my first teacher. That didn't take long. This guy was an English Teacher at an international school here in Vietnam. 
 He was immediately fired from his school, his apartment was contacted and they notified police immediately. He is losing his work permit. His embassy is aware of the situation. 
 It is very scary to think there are teachers out there trying to meet up with kids for pleasures. Thankfully, he met me instead of a kid and I reported ALL INFORMATION to proper authorities. 
 You can watch the catch on YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I will continue to do my part to protect the community and children in Vietnam. 
 I know some of you were skeptical about my original post when I said I was going to do this. 3 catches in 8 days is the results so far. Again, all evidence against each predator is always submitted to local authorities, employers, family members, embassies and whomever else may need it. That is all I can do on my end. 
 Much love to all of you! Thanks for your time. Will continue to update the community when new catches come out as you may know this person. Share, share, share and make others aware of these guys.

 Any suggestion helps, Thank you!! :)

 Over the past few years I've started reading around Chinese politics and have been intrigued by all the goings on in the CCCP. As my spouse is Vietnamese, I would be interested to read any English language resources that there are about the goings on inside the Vietnamese Communist party, whether it be books, websites or other formats.
 Does anyone have any preferred texts / suggestions?

I’ll be in HCMC/ Phu Quo/ Da Nang/ Phnom Penh/ Siem Reep & Hanoi. Anyone think $1000 US is enough to have a good trip or is $1500 US more reasonable to spend ? Roughly 16 days in Vietnam and 5 nights in Cambodia. I want to be able to buy whatever I want/need without having to worry (ex. Go to fancy restaurants and order King Crab). For all I know, maybe $1500 US isn’t enough for the lifestyle I’m going for. First time traveller to Vietnam, any thoughts or tips would help :) and yes, I know that it’s best to bring crisp new $100 US bills + every hotel I’m staying at has breakfast included.

They would ask for coffee money of 10 dollars per person after assistance. Is this legitimate? 
 Do they split the money with the airport officers guarding (they check to make sure you have a boarding pass/passport-not the ticket agent of the airline) the entry door of departure? Any experience with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, my wife got a job in Vietnam. We are moving there at the end of the month. I am trying to figure out how much money we will need to bring and how (cash, card, etc?).
 Does it make sense to exchange USD to VTN Dong is US and already come with Dong? Do we bring cash and try to exchange it instead? What is the best move? 
 As i understand, she will be able to open a bank account there once she has her work visa done. With that said, we will have substantial spending for first month and she won't get paid until the end of the month (finding apartment, 2 months deposit plus first months rent, food, necessities etc). I am thinking we need to bring enough USD cash with us otherwise we will get destroyed with foreign exchange fees? I also read there are limits on daily withdrawals? Is it feasible to bring USD and exchange it at gold shops? Is there a limit how much they will exchange? What about airports?
 ​
 Any advice or ideas would be appreciated it.
 ​
 Thank you!

Live shows with local bands, too
 I will be around 3 weeks in each place (if that matters).
 Or even places where alternative people gather. I have an alternative look when I don't work, and I feel more comfortable when I hang out with other local alternative people rather than strolling the cities idly in my gothic attire. Especially being an alternative woman, it can be kind of alienating.
 I don't speak Vietnamese even though I'm trying to learn some basics in order to be able to communicate with local people if that matters too :P
 Thank you!

I have a top box for my motorbike and go around Saigon once a week passing out waters and food. Every week, I try and go to a different district and look for those in need especially the kids who are working on the street corners just trying to help their families. 
 If anyone has a top box and lives in Saigon as well and wants to go out with me sometime it is truly a rewarding experience. The smiles and gratitude stick with you and make every day meaningful. Please reach out to me via messenger and maybe we can get a group going. I have been doing this for around 12 weeks straight and will continue to do it, but would be cool to get a little group going.

I think these kids were Hmongs, did not have european traits (just Vietnamese with blond hair).

Have already found a Vietnamese business partner I can trust, so I don't mind if I don't own the company on paper? Doesn't need the business to thrive, just want it to run on itself so it can sponsor my business visa.

I had learned through online resources the way you hi to people is “Xin chào” for formal and just “chào” for informal. I took Spanish the last two years of school and had learned to use “usted” to say “you” formally to people older than you or to higher-ups, so I assumed I would use “Xin chào” to greet my family. When my dad picks me up from school, I began to greet him with “Xin chào,” but recently he told me I would actually say “Con chào ba” to greet him or anyone else (pronouns changing depending on person). I was curious if that was a regional thing (my dad is from south vietnam but my bà nội is from north vietnam/south china) or if that’s a general thing among all vietnamese people?

 Does anyone know of any war memorials in Saigon that aren't in museums. I've tried searching but have not found any results that don't direct me to the War Remnants Museum. Is this on purpose?
 How do the residents of Saigon commemorate the war or is it a subject they much rather not discuss? (The Vietnamese war is something I have only recently found out about so please excuse my ignorance)
 Any help is greatly appreciated and if this is not the place to ask please direct me to the correct thread.

 Will be in Da Nang during Tet and my friend who is living in Vietnam said that everything will be closed and be ready to buy some noodles beforehand so you would have something to eat. He lives in Hanoi though, so I was wondering if everything is closed in Da Nang also?
 If this is not the thing in Da Nang, then where could I get information on what is happening and when?

 Can anyone recommend me and FOODIE hot spots? Ideally places local go - inexpensive, delicious foods not to miss out on. 
 I'm reading up on Bun Cha is pretty exclusive to Hanoi... also the dill fish noodles?

 I just wanted to ask for some book recommendations for my Vietnamese mom. She basically does not read, just a typical Facebook mom haha. Her memory is getting a bit worse so I want her brain to keep sharp with a bit of reading.
 I was thinking some very easy read, maybe like some romance novel or any interesting thriller, action, drama. Those are at least the kind of movies I see her watching, so I think that genre would be good.
 Also I’m currently moving between Germany and Czech Republic, do you know what is the best way to even get books in Vietnamese? I was googling, but I always just get the translated version and not the Vietnamese:( 
 Thanks!

 So I’m freaking out a little as I’ve booked seperate flights with a self transit to get back home from Cambodia with Cambodia Angkor air to Ho Chi Minh and then the final stretch with Vietnam airlines to Australia tomorrow and I didn’t realise that I might have needed an e-visa to collect my baggage and continue on with my journey. 
 Has anyone ever done this before or might know exactly what we can do in terms of getting a transit visa to get home? 
 I’m currently riding on getting my luggage as carry on and doing an online check in so there will be no need to actually go past the immigration area. 
 If anyone has any advice I’ll be really grateful. This is causing me a fair amount of stress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Duolingo, and I've picked up a (very little) bit from just living here ... I can buy food, deal with money, understand classroom commands etc. Obviously, I'm a teacher. I also generally can understand what topic people are talking about, but not what they're saying, if that makes sense.
 My issue with Duolingo is that I like knowing what I'm learning, not just guessing. As in, I'd like to know the grammar rules and stuff. I know not everyone learns that way, but I quite like to learn theoretically! This will be my fourth language to learn, so I feel like I have an idea of how I best learn. (I am not fluent in my third, but have learnt enough to get by in simple situations, which is kind of what I'm aiming for here).
 I am thinking of asking one of the Vietnamese teachers I work with for a lesson once a week but my schedule doesn't allow time for much more. Self study would be ideal for me, especially reading, grammar and vocab. I have lots of short pockets of time to kill between lessons. I have a handle on most of the tones, but that's what I would focus on with an in person teacher (tones, pronunciation etc).
 Any resources to recommend? I'd greatly appreciate it :) 
 Cảm ơn bạn bè!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a tour or tour guide in Saigon that is interested in discussing the political history of VietNam and Ho Chi Minh from a socialist/communist perspective.
 I understand that looking for a tour like this in English might be unpopular/lacking because a lot of western opinions on these perspectives are neutral to negative, thus they probably don't want to do these tours. I also feel that most tours and guides around the world play it very safe and conduct their tours in the most uncontroversial or unchallenging ways possible, which can be problematic for someone who wants to hear about a problematic or contested period of history. I've even been on a few tours in Central Europe (ahem Hungary) that went far the other way with very conservative nationalistic and revisionist recollections of historical moments, but I feel it's difficult to find guides or tours with a collectivist mentality.
 Does anyone have any tours or guides they can recommend to me for January? Or am I thinking too hard about this, and maybe the average Vietnamese guide does feel this way and want to share about their country through this lens? I just don't want a guide that gives me a Wikipedia summary of Saigon's political/social history because they think it's what I want to hear.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am curious how popular it is for girls to dye their hair in Vietnam and if the elders were to complain if the girls dye their hair brown, blonde, red, blue, pink, etc?
 In my family (all Vietnamese, living in the US), my 85 year old uncle (aunt's husband) really hates hair dye to the point where if one of his family members dye their hair (ex. my cousin), he would yell at them. My cousin dyed her hair blonde and she ended up being scorned by him. He told her "you look very ugly with the hair dye. Please un-dye the hair".
 His daughter had cancer and had to undergo chemo and because she lost her hair, she decided to buy a wig. I think she went with the black hair wig because if she went with blonde, her father would disown her.
 Also, for some of my cousins (part of the uncle and aunt's side), they brainwash their children not to dye their hair. They say that not only does hair dye look ugly (even brown or blonde hair because one part is light and the other is dark), it causes cancer as well. According to them, if their children dye their hair, they will get grounded (maybe even spanked) and they might get disowned by the family because they are seen as 'rebellious'.
 I definitely don't view that way and I view hair dye as a person's identity and personality.

THe weather updates we find for the last and next weeks look very wet and we've found a video of flooded streets in Hoi An. I know it is Typhoon season in this area now, but is it expected to get any better by then? We would be planning to do outdoors activities like visiting temples and beaches and possibly snorkeling or scuba diving but none of them seem like good options if the weather is as bad as it is now.
 Would it be better to spend less time in this area and go to Mui Ne, Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta for 2 weeks instead of one? Maybe spend some time in Dalat?

I went with my wife last time and this time going with my parents, sister, and her husband. Are there a lot of options in typical tourist cities for 3 bedrooms or just book separate rooms? Not sure which would be cheaper and availability.

 We are due to go HCMC this weekend for 4 days and are worried that the weather in HCMC looks really hot for the kids (31c). They are ok in Phu Quoc but we are next to the sea in a resort.
 We were wondering what is the weather actually like in HCMC during the day and evening? Bearable or not?
 Also tips for stuff to do would be good taking the weather into account!

In the duration of my stay, the department of education in Yen Bai didn’t grant me the work permit because they were confused about my BA which is a degree in English Language Teaching. Therefore, I’ve started looking for a job in Hanoi but my visa is about to expire. 
 During one of my interviews, an employer told me that I had to do a visa run because I don’t have a work permit. Is this correct or are there any ways that the employer may not know about? If it is correct, what is the cheapest way to do a visa run? I’ve done research about it and found some information but if there is anyone here who knows about this stuff or has had a personal experience like this, I would like to hear from them cause I’m in a dire situation. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2024, I am thinking of going to Vietnam for the first time since the pandemic began (I might go to Vietnam in 2023, but I have to see my itinerary as my parents might instead come to visit the US, so I might not need to go to Vietnam, and plus, I am taking Summer 2023 to go to Europe, so I might not have time to go to Vietnam).
 As for transportation, since public transportation is quite limited in HCMC compared to places like Boston, NYC, Washington DC, San Francisco, Europe, Moscow (used to live/study in Moscow before moving to the US, so I know the public transit situation in Russia), etc, I think I might either rent a car or use a motorcycle to get around.
 Since I typically don't use taxicabs when I was in Vietnam when I was young, instead, parents drove me around Vietnam in their car, I don't know how much taxis between HCMC and Binh Duong cost (my mother's siblings live in Binh Duong by the way), so I think I might either rent a car or a motorbike.
 In Vietnam (my home country and country of birth), I am planning to be there for around 2 weeks, and from what I have seen on Kayak, Google, etc, there are not so many traditional rental providers in HCMC Vietnam (eg. Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, etc). With that said, since I wanted to go around HCMC, go to Binh Duong, and maybe go to Nha Trang and back (I am planning to go there by myself), should I buy a motorbike or should I rent a car?
 I am also curious about road conditions in Vietnam if they are any good or not (things change a lot in three years as Vietnam is quickly developing) and plus, are trains/buses any good or should I just stick with the motorbike and the car?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I’ve lived in Vietnam 6+ years and have had many Vietnamese teachers, but I’ve finally found one I really enjoy learning from. 
 I used to learn from her in person in Vietnam but now I just learn on zoom. 
 I recommended her to another person here on Reddit who just gave me feedback about how great she is so I thought I’d try to get her a few more students by advertising here. I get nothing from this except I just want to support her. 
 She makes custom lessons depending on what you want to learn and you’re learning style. She’s an actual teacher in Vietnam but luckily she teaches Vietnamese to foreigners (or viet kieu) with more of a western style … if you know what I mean 😂
 I think she charges about 14-16 dollars per hour. 
 Please send me a message for her contact info. Thanks

 i don't see the problem of my country being communist is a bad thing. 
 But i see in here alot of American or people live in developed country really didn't not like Communist country.
 what i had seen is we are not restricted to anything. and we are really free to do anything. 
 i think i am being biased because i don't know much about hte large scale impact of How communist part impact normal people like me. Since i don't know any better.
 What are you guys observance on what Vietnamese are restricted to under Communist Party?

 Any suggestions are welcome. Looking to avoid crowds and traffic where possible so my image is that (for example) a trail run or a loop around a big park/lake would be ideal. 
 Open to tips on hydration and prep as well (including some food that's gonna go down well as I'm not a massive fan of Vietnamese cuisine outside ban xeo, a simple pho (no 'special' ingredients), banh hoi and fresh fruit/veg. 
 I've never run in Vietnam but I've run during Japanese summers and am picturing something pretty similar in terms of humidity (i.e. I had to do shorter distances at slower speeds otherwise I'd get exhausted/dehydrated really quickly). Looking forward to adding a few solid Vietnamese runs to my Strava and (hopefully) improving my conditioning through this. Don't wanna use the humidity as an excuse to get fat/lazy.

 JMG got stopped by an elderly man (acting as the security guard of the building), he tried to explain to the guard that he is a doctor and there's a person dying inside. The guard didn't let him go inside because this is a private property, not a complex building. JMG was very agitated at this refusal so the guard tried to keep his distance, JMG chased the guard down and scrub him by the neck like an animal, push him back to the house, pote tially smack him a couple of time and tell him to open the door. A local man then came out and explain to JMG in English that he is the owner of this building, there's no other person inside and he is making a big mistake. 
 JMG friends arrived and admit they gave him the wrong address then rush inside another house to save a dying man. The police arrived at the scene later and JMG was very uncooperative, refuse to admit that he was assaulting an elderly man and insult them. 
 Now JMG is running a public relation campaign, trying to pay the press about how his actions are just, that everything he did was trying to save a man from heart attack, and he just a bit strong handed with the guard.

 I dont remember the plot but i was maybe in the 1920s. The actors were dressed in suits and fedoras and equiped with handguns. Cound be something towards mafia,crime war or even japanese occupation.
 The opening or ending song was something similar to "Bella Ciao" 
 Chinese version on YT: Bella ciao
 It always aired everyday at 10pm or even later
 Take my description with a grain of salt because some of it could be straight up bullshit

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi again to this great, responsive community! 
 I'm writing to see if anyone can recommend a bakery that makes colorful/detailed cakes (this one is for a birthday, but any beautiful cakes are welcome) in Saigon?
 I saw some pictures elsewhere of dragon cakes, and others responding that cakes with zodiac characters are popular in Vietnam, but these types of bakeries and cakes don't show up when I try to search for them. I'm not really interested in European/western flavors or designs or characters, I hope to find something generally like this. 
 I can't speak Vietnamese so phone communication might be difficult, but of you know any such bakeries with an email address, I can surely translate a request and send it on to them. Thanks for any recommendations you may have!
 Edit: I did see that someone wrote bakeries like Givral may have something like this, but I didn't see options on their website so I wonder if such cakes just aren't posted online?

First of all, do we have any rights if the accomodation is a scam or the rooms are bait-and-switch? I am guessing not. Second, I can't seem to be able to reach the booking.com customer service. All the time the response comes from the host. Third, the system didn't take my card details, but cancellation is not possible(well, you can cancel but at a cost of the reservation)
 Not sure if this is the norm in Vietnam or some sort of scam/bait and switch operation??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! My partner and I are in Vietnam for the first time and have some questions about Ha Long Bay if anyone could please advise? 
  
Firstly, as someone who can feel seasick on rough water am I likely to feel ill on a cruise, especially overnight? Or are the waters so still that boats are barely rocking? 
 
Secondly, we are trying to decide between Ha Long Bay or Lan Ha Bay. Which would you recommend for a first timer? Seems like Ha Long Bay is a little more spectacular and can walk inside caves but super duper touristy, Lan Ha Bay slightly less touristy but a little less grand? Or is it just worth it to go to both?
 
Is it worth it to stay on Cat Ba? It seems like we'd have a slightly less hectic experience if we spent a couple of days on Cat Ba and did some hiking or kayaking, is it worth going to? 
 
Is there easy to access and regular public transport from the North of Cat Ba where the ferry drops off to the South where hotels are? Apparently there are buses and taxis bit not sure how easy they are to get or how regular.
 
 Thanks for any help! :)

I know most people just take their shoes off inside and have bare feet, but is the use of an inside pair of shoes a common thing in Vietnam, or is that just a tourist thing for hostels? Thank you! 🇻🇳

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are currently travelling through Vietnam. We were told the local gold dealers were a good place to exchange cash. We found a very busy one in HCMC but they went through our AUD and picked out different notes and gave a different rate on the different notes. 
 What is going on here? Isn’t it all the same?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone, I'm planning to visit Vietnam from 14th to 23rd Jan 2023, I recently discovered that Tet festival will be celebrated from 22nd Jan and most tourist places will be closed a week before.
 Is this true? Should I postpone my travel? I'll be be traveling to Da Nang Sapa Hanoi Ninh Binh.
 Also, I hear that train street is closed for tourist, so can we atleast go and have coffee at the shops or it's completely closed?
 Any suggestions and tips will be helpful.
 Thanks

Me and my husband are traveling to Ho Chi Minh City 16th of Jan 2023, were we will spend 3 days before flying to Phu Quoc 20th and staying there for 11 days. We are mostly traveling to Vietnam for the food, culture and to just enjoy the weather and the beaches. I have 3 questions. 1. Should we be worried that tet starts 22nd of Jan, if we want to visit local restaurants and museums in Ho Chi Minh City? 2. Do you have any recommendations for authentic Vietnamese food in any of those places? 3. What are some must see places in Phu Quoc?

 We just opened up a waitlist to onboard early users as beta testers at getcode.com
 Our goal is to get 10 people from every country on the waitlist. There's a good early Vietnamese community growing so I wanted to post here and see if others might be interested. You can sign up directly at getcode.com and feel free to send me a message as well if you have any thoughts/questions. 
 Would love to get you on Code when we start rolling out and get your feedback.

I am on a visit in Vietnam after a very long time (last time I was here was when I was a small kid). Basically, I am visiting all my close and not so close relatives and most of my aunties and uncles are giving me money as a gift. What is the etiquette in Vietnam about accepting/refusing such gifts? I really appreciate their love and I am thankful they want to gift me money, but I don't really need money. For me it's enough that I can meet them and spend time with them after such a long time. They all come from wealthier backgrounds so they are gifting me large amounts of money (in the range of hundreds of dollars basically), I would prefer to refuse the money - is that acceptable in Vietnam or is it a taboo and I have to accept the money gifts? Thank you

 https://youtu.be/RN8IWPsuFE8
 I read the comments I thought it was friendly phrase used by Vietnamese that see Laos as friends/brothers but then I looked it up only and some source I found makes it sound more of a derogatory term to lower class Vietnamese. So what does Đông Lào really mean?
 Side note: Thai use the phrase West Vietnam, Lao-Kaew or Lao-Dang to Lao people as a derogatory term for those who are mixed with Viet or those embrace Lao-Viet brotherhood. Many Thai believe the Lao government is a puppet to Vietnam. And that the Lao government teaches their people to hate Thai and love Viet more. The truth is Thai has done more damage to the people of Lao for centuries. Link below if you want to read about Thai-Lao history

 I currently have booked a tour of Hang En 2D/1N with Oxalis adventures for around $300. I was thinking of booking something with Jungle Boss tours of Elephant cave and Ma Da Valley where we would hike and swim through caves in one day ($65). Side note: I'm planning on doing a motorbike tour after that will bring me from Phong Nha to Khe Sahn to Hue and then to Da Nang/Hoi An over 3 days (~$210). 
 The Hang En tour is the most expensive thing I'm doing on my trip so I'm trying to figure out whether I can get a very similar experience by seeing a different cave. I've never really explored any caves so I'm not sure what to expect.

In regards to the Opium pipe just anything beautiful that isn't a rush job/souvenir. Not sure if I'd like to take something vintage away from the country but any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 Any suggestions on whether I should stay in Da Nang or Hoi An? It seems like there is no consensus on Hoi An, some people say it should only be a day trip and other people wish they had spent more time there. I have a mid-budget and care most about trying great food, having unique accommodations, beautiful scenery, and being able to go on cool day tours. I'm not interested in shopping so Hoi An does not sound very appealing. I fly out of Da Nang which is why I thought it would make sense to stay there and make a day trip to Hoi An. It also seems like similar tours are offered from each location. 
 My rough itinerary is as follows: Hanoi - 2 nights; Ha Long Bay - 2D/1night then bus to Ninh Binh - 1 night, overnight bus to Phong Nha - 4 nights then train to Hue - 1 night; then easy rider to Da Nang/Hoi An - 2 nights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I try to have conversations with vietnamese people via chat, while still learning vietnamese right now. I am mostly able to understand them, but still have some struggles. To name a few examples, which I coudn't find answers for:
  
How do I agree with someone in an informal way and not sound too formal, especially to people who I refer to as "em"? Is "Dạ" and "Vâng" too formal? While "Ừ" or "À" kinda seems too inappropriate and informal.
 
What does "nek" and "nè" mean? I read somewhere that these are the same, but I still don't really know what they exactly mean.
 
What is the difference between "nha" and "nhé"?
 
What is the difference between "rùi" and "rồi"
 
Is "á", "ợ", "ah" at the end of the sentence the same as "ạ"? Why not just use "ạ" if it is the case.
 
I'd like to know more shortforms which are very common in chatting. It would be great if you guys could name me some.
 
 My goal is to become more natural and fluent in vietnamese. Hope someone can help. Thanks in advance. :)

I paid with card in supermarkets for small stuff, like 10k for a bottle of water, and this has never been a problem.
 I gave been told today by my hotel that I'll be charged a 3% fee to use my card (big hotel chain, the bill is 1.8M). 
 Is this legal and common?I am pretty sure that in my country it would be considered illegal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 Long story short, I was put up for adoption to live a better life in America when I was 2 (mistake child, have 2 biological brothers 10+ years older than me). I grew up in a great family in the states, but I’ve always wanted to go find my biological family. Right before COVID I traveled to Vietnam for 30 days to try and find my family. I found them after a few days and lived with them for the remainder of my time there and I’ve gotten very close to them these past couple years.
 I am going to visit them here soon for Tet and want to give them money and gifts. How much money should I give them (enough to be generous, but not enough for them to rely on me)? And what gifts should I bring? My two brothers have 2 kids each and they are all mid-teens, so I bought each family laptops for school / college. I was thinking candy? I had a bunch of candy that I had brought last time and the kids loved it. 
 Thanks in advance!

 But I’ve also heard hông biết used for “I don’t know” and a YT video explained using that for “I don’t know”
 So I’m basically asking is hông ever used (outside of hông biết) ? Is it just an alternative pronunciation of không?

 I'm somewhat pretty interested on the conflict called the Vietnam War, I watched/read quite a few things about it and I used to live in HCMC. The documentary of Ken Burns was super interesting but to me it lacks of the Vietnamese people's experience at the time. If you have some ressources to share about it (even in Vietnamese language) I would be grateful :)
 The conflict with the french is interesting too, if you have anything about it please send it my way. Peace.

 A lot of Vietnamese (here on Reddit) hate Vietnamese Americans because we are anti-communist and accuse us as traitors. While Vietnamese Americans accuse Vietnamese in Vietnam as brainwash idiots.
 However, if we lived in each other shoes, we would probably do the same thing that each side accuses each other off doing. 
 If you lived through the war and saw your people murder and torture by the communist government regardless if you are from Northern or Southern Vietnam, you would not be pro-communist. Similarity, if all you learned in school was the Vietnam War (American War) from the perspective of the winner (North Vietnam), then your view will be in favor of the current regime. 
 Our views, experiences, attitudes, behaviors are shaped base on the context of our lives and those of our families. 
 But one thing that we can agree on is that we want Vietnam to become a develop country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào các bạn!
 I am a 21yo & half vietnamese, half european (french & italian). I both have vietnamese and european features (& nationalities). I principally lived in France, and I did not learn vietnamese when I was younger, I knew a little from previous trips. I am currently Việt Nam for 3 months by myself (it's been more than 2 months now) and I am speaking a lot better, can hold conversation. Somehow, most of the people here see me as a foreigner. When I approach them (bằng tiếng việt) they stare at me & hit me with the "tây ạ?" and ask me why I can speak vietnamese. I have to explain myself pretty much every time to anyone speaking to me, & also not to have the tourist prices haha. Also every time I go to the countryside, everyone stares at me like & talk about me like I don't understand them lol.
 ​
 It hurts me as I always considered myself vietnamese, as I lived with my việt kiều mom most of my life and growing up w vietnamese culture, I feel very vietnamese to put it simple haha. It starts to make me feel a bit sad, & even sometimes I feel wrong not to look viet enough & don't feel like I belong to this community. Everybody in France can tell I am asian from my features, but here I am a foreigner to them.
 ​
 Do you have any tips on how to approach this situation? Does anybody have been through the same experience? I think it would make me feel better to know that I am not alone in this. 
 ​
 Cảm ơn mngười! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm staying for 3 months, originally rented a place already. When I arrived, everything was not as advertised and/or broken and the landlord hangs up on me. I need to find a new place to stay soon.
 I am looking for a place with 2 rooms, already furnished, kitchen, wifi, and a/c. 
 I see that the posts here usually say to look on facebook but can someone recommend me some groups? 
 As for district, probably 5,8,10? but I am open to other districts as well.
 Has anyone rented a place similar to what I am looking for? What does it usually cost? Please give me an idea of what to expect in cost to rent!
 I've asked around and see that a lot of places only allow you to rent if you plan to stay for 6 + months. I would rather have it month by month since I don't want to run into the same issue I am having now with my current place.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because Vinfast is popular in Vietnam with the Vinfast Fadil being one of the best sellers in the past three years, do you think Vinfast would be popular towards Vietnamese Americans, given the fact there are many Vietnamese Americans who are anti-communist (like many of my mother's relatives who live in the US)?
 Also, I am curious if Vietnamese Americans are willing to buy a Vinfast or would they choose another car (like a Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Volvo, Porsche, VW, Polestar, GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, etc)? For me, even though I was born in Vietnam and currently live in the US (my parents still live in Vietnam however), I am not thinking of getting a Vinfast as there are many EVs which offer better value for the money, in my opinion (like Hyundai Ioniq 5, where there is a better brand cachet).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. For years I've been using a Garmin 66i for my hiking across Europe and North America. I recently started travelling to Vietnam for work, spending weeks at a time there (4 trips this year already, 82 days in country total - just since August). I brought my 66i and I've been doing hikes with some of the locals on the weekends. It's been amazing. However, I've come to find that my Garmin has almost no detail about any of the areas I hike in. No trails, no contour, no roads. Many times it is blank. It's fine for tracking where I go, should I need to find my way out, but it's a pain to try and plan or navigate some of our hikes when I can't really see what is out there.
 I checked Garmin's website and there's no maps to purchase. There seems to be third parties selling SE-Asia maps but I can't really get a read on how trustworthy they are.
 Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations? I'm heading back out in a few weeks for a 6 week trip, one week of which we'll be going deep into the woods in northern Vietnam for 4 nights 5 days hiking and exploring caves. I'd like to have my garmin properly giving me information.

 We're visiting Vietnam during the second week of December. We'll be going directly to Tuan Chau harbour from the Airport. We are five of us and prefer to have a taxi ? Any idea where we can book it from and how much it would cost ? The cruise company is charging us 180 USD for one time transfer which seems quite excessive
 Can you'll recommend any options ?

I would say I know very elementary statements but don’t know much about the grammar or past/future tenses. So assume I know little to no Vietnamese to begin with. And now I’m visiting Vietnam at the end of the year and want to be able to carry small conversations with relatives, restaurant/store workers, etc. does anyone have any tips on learning basic conversational vocabulary and pronunciation?

 I am interested in meeting local people, not so much interested in simply partying and getting plastered with other expats/tourists. Are the local people of Vietnam keen on hanging out for NYE celebrations? Or is the lunar new year more popular of a holiday in VN?
 Also, what are some good ways to meet people and learn about the people and culture in VN? From what I've read, if you look like a foreigner (I am 190cm white guy from America lol) people will talk to you if they see you eating by yourself and are generally quite friendly. Is this true? I'd love to meet people and feel warm and welcome, unlike when I went to Australia and it felt almost the same as America--super lonely and hard to meet people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all, 
 I have lived and worked in Vietnam for the last 5 years. But recently I have been denied entry to Vietnam and I don't know why. I left Vietnam to get a TRC which requires foreigners to leave Vietnam and come back on a business visa in order to obtain a TRC. However I have been denied by Hanoi immigration due to a 'immigration violation'. 
 I still do not know exactly what the problem is and how to fix it! I am more than happy to pay a fine. I have tried many times to call and email Hanoi immigration but still no reply. I even visited Vietnam embassy in Thailand and London but they couldn't help. 
 Is there anyone that can help me or give me a contact with someone that works in VN immigration so I can speak to them directly and fix this problem. 
 I have wasted a lot of money and time on agents who take my money under many promises but then do not help at all!
 I am a British citizen and currently living in London. I appreciate any help and kind of desperate as I have all my clothes, my jobs, my apartment, everything still in Saigon :( 
 Thank you all

 Moving to Saigon in February and want to carry on kickboxing or start muay thai etc.
 All of the gyms I have found online, the prices are pretty crazy. I understand I'll probably find inflated prices but to pay 200 - 300 dollars a month is quite a shock haha.
 Does anyone have any recommendations of mma/ muay Thai/ kickboxing gyms that are not expat traps?
 Again, Im not expecting to pay local prices.
 Any help is appreciated 🙏

We live in Vietnam. I normally drive an electric motorbike and don't have a motorbike license. I have a TRC. I've learned that one of the leading motorbike rental shops (QT Motorbikes) will rent a motorbike to me, but they require that I leave my passport with them. I don't like doing that. (Also, I might need my passport at a hotel or if the police stop us.) I'm looking for recommendations for a motorbike rental in Ha Giang that will rent a semi-automatic bike to me for two days without requiring my passport as a deposit. Thanks
 Edit: Would welcome hotel recommendations in Ha Giang and places to see within a few hours' motorbike ride, too.

 My university has offered a trip to Vietnam for a month because our university collaborates with a university (BUV) in Vietnam, Hanoi and I need to do some volunteering work and such.
 Expenses such as Flights and accommodation are covered which is nice and is why I took the offer. I have never been outside of Europe and have no real idea what to expect. 
 I'm eager to have this new experience and see a completely different culture and hopefully meet some nice people :)
 What should I expect? And any tips?
 Thank you :)

 I’m curious about the wealth distribution by age in Vietnam. Been in Vietnam for a few weeks now. I’ve noticed a lot of people in their late 20s/30s wear nicer/designer clothes and tend to have fancier bikes than those older than 40. Although, I also know people that are younger may tend to care about these visual indicators of wealth more.
 Vietnam is a rapidly modernizing country, so I’d assume people born in the late 80s/90s have had better career opportunity? Curious about people’s perspective here. Assuming that the fallouts of the wars with America and China took some time to economically recover from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time I booked them. Actually booked AA but the carrier was JAL. I thought JAL had a decent reputation.
 Other than some super efficient and sweet stewardesses this was not a good experience. 
  
Tried to upgrade to an emergency aisle seat for 100$. At first the very nice Caucasian worker said ok. But after checking with the Japanese JAL rep they said no. Only Japanese citizens can book it. Huh????? Can you imagine if AA said only Americans can book certain seats?
 
Inflight entertainment really blew. The movie selection was like a scarce selection of movies one might find at a rummage sale. They did have one James Bond movie. I ended up watching that and Shawshank Redemption for the umpteenth time. The hardware interface had such lag you never knew if a button press actually worked. Had to restart a few times. I know it's a lot to ask but nowadays a selection of podcasts is pretty common. Also, and this is in general, why can't airlines offer live newsfeeds? JAL had a day old BBC International segment and one Japanese language news segment.
 
I sat economy. The seat was particularly torturous even for economy. It was hard and small. I spent the last 6 hours of the flight rotating my position trying to find new unused parts of my ass that would give me ten minutes of relief. I'm a medium size guy.
 
The food was typical airline food in this case limited to Japanese cuisine That was ok by me but I thought I'd mention it. I had two legs on this flight: BOS to NRT (14 hrs) and NRT to SGN,( 6 hrs).Both flights had the exact same menu. I just skipped meal service completely on the second flight. 
 
 Maybe my experience was a one-off. Anyone want to share?
 Thanks.

 Has anyone done this in HCMC and what banks would you recommend/avoid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I am currently visiting Vietnam and really enjoy the country, culture and cuisine! Therefore I want to buy some nice chopsticks as a souvenir for home that reminds me of this country whenever I try to replicate one of the delicious dishes.
 But so far I could only find some on the night markets and they don't look good or of good quality to be honest. I am looking for a nice design, wooden and local/handmade would be a nice addition. Currently I am in Hanoi and will be leaving soon. Googeling brought me to these of Hanoi Desing Center ( http://hanoidesigncentre.com/product/570-wooden-chopsticks-m17). But unfortunately the shop doesn't seem to exist anymore, I checked the location and they don't reply on Facebook.
 Do you know any stories where I can get something like this? I would really like to find some nice ones. Thank you!

 Ive occasionally heard different stories about the spouse inheriting or having to sell to get the value and even the local family being awarded the property. But I never heard in practicality what happens in this situation. 
 Or what is best to do before hand to simplify the inheritance procedure.

I've read that jewellery stores give you the best rate but does anybody have any specific spots in D3 so I don't have to travel too far with my cash? 
 Also I plan on getting a VN sim, if I call around to some stores to ask what their exchange rate is would they understand English? I don't know any Vietnamese outside of random food menu items lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i'm moving to Vietnam in a couple weeks to teach English for the first time. I want to live in District 3 or Binh Tanh but the language centres I've been offered are all around a 20 minute drive from these places. So it looks like ima have to rent/buy a motorbike/scooter. I currently don't have a license but I've read you can ride a 50cc scooter without one. How easy/doable would it be to rent a 50cc motorbike for a 40 minute round-trip each day?
 After I've settled in a little, I'll probably work on getting a license.
 In the meantime, does anyone know of any other ways to get about the city that wouldn't be as expensive as getting a taxi every day?
 Cheers

 I’m spending 30 days in Vietnam and don’t really mind the cost as such but I want something that will work the entire duration, not something that will work 1 day and shit bricks the following. If you got a sim at the airport, which kiosk did you go to? 
 I went back in April and had no issues with grabbing a random kiosk seller sim but seem like a lot of people are reporting issues of reliable sim at the airport lately.

 I’m sure this is coming from a place of privilege. But I have a deep feeling of belonging here. I’m sure I will be back for business. But I wish I could stay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted another opinion on this as I want to be safe.
 Me and my partner are interested in doing the Ha Giang loop in a few days. My partner has been driving all over southeast Asia with me on the back for the past several months with no issues. However, we've only ever driven an automatic and we're a bit nervous as I saw a couple posts on here that said a semi automatic or manual was needed to do the loop. We messaged the scooter rental we rented from before when we did the Hai Van pass to ask them about the loop and they told us it was safe to do the loop on a 125cc automatic scooter with two people on it. We wanted something a bit bigger if we could do it on an automatic but they don't have anything over 125cc.
 Just wondering from people who have done it recently, especially with all the construction I've read about, if they felt that would be adequate. If not, maybe we might get a lesson on the semi automatic when we get to Ha Giang and see how comfortable we feel on it before deciding what to do? 
 Thanks!

Does anyone know how difficult this is or if it’s even possible? I don’t think it’s as simple as turning up with a stall? I imagine if it’s “first come first served” the locals would not be very happy about you beating them to it. I would think there’s some regulation and rent to be paid though? 
 She is looking into it but was hoping someone here might know something about it!

 The Ha Giang Loop is an iconic ride through Northern Vietnam. Stunning mountain passes, delicious food, and chilly weather are certainly the highlights of the trip. 
 It's absolutely on the tourist circuit, however. Be prepared to pass swarms of tourists, both domestic and foreign, on small scooters. Nearly every guest house in the towns you stop at will be full and, most likely, will have a party going on. 
 Overall, an excellent ride that I'd highly recommend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this is the place for this. But I’m doing a solo trip to Vietnam for 3 weeks in December (9th to 29th). If anyone else is in a similar position and wants to meet up, let me know. I’m not a creep, just a normal woman in her early 30s, and thought it might be cool to meet some fellow redditors!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need some recommendations of fome coffee equipment. I currently own a Timemore C2 grinder, Aeropress go, Hario french press, some phin filter & a cheap shopee scale (but the timer couldn't work anymore). I am listing them so you can have a good gauge of my budget vs quality.
 I am thinking of getting a gooseneck kettle, a new scale & V60. 
 1) Gooseneck Kettle: I am not sure if I should get a temp controlled one at this point. But I want a small one. Not those 1L and above. Looking at Hario or time more
 2) V60: Plastic, ceramic vs copper?
 3) Just get a cheap one from amazon? Is it worth to get so expensive. whats the diff?
 What brands and model should I be looking at?

In the beginning, she was eating a sandwich. By the end, the mustache fell off her face, and funnily she takes the mustache and stick it between her brows like a unibrow and also onto his face. At one point, to show masculinity she pulls her pants up all gungho and declared 'I AM MAN!' in English. The boyfriend was so nervous that he was trembling so much to the point that he shook off the couch and fell onto the floor. She was later revealed to be female.

The singer or the person it was focusing on is a female with red hair, actual blood-red or rose-red hair. The world is about to end with astroids or meteors hitting Earth. The female goes about her day while everything is in chaos around. At one point she was at the gas station getting gas and at a store getting groceries while everyone around her is panicking. By the end of the music video, she is eating a (romantic) dinner with someone (maybe not human) while a meteor is about to hit the earth.

 Is there anything I should be conscious of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, first time in Vietnam and I'm trying to use BusMap to get from my Hotel to Walking Street ( Phố đi bộ ). Yesterday I was waiting for bus "route 152" at (Route 152 (backward) First Station Sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất .. Bến Thành — Khu dân cur Trung Son Pickup for every 12-18 minutes). I was waiting for over 1 hour and I see the bus "152" passed me 4 times and never stopped to pick me up. I'm confused how to use the app because I'm following the directions the app tells me. Should I walk to the other bus stop further down the road? Please help!
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I am American, learning Vietnamese for a couple months now. This weekend I was at a temple and as we were leaving I went to grab my shoes from the shelf but an older lady was in front so I said “xin lỗi bà...” She turned around and said some things I did not understand, but from her tone I’m pretty sure they weren’t very happy. 
 Did I insult her?? Is there something different I should have said?? Not sure if this is the right place for this question but everyone here is very nice so figured I’d give it a shot. 
 Cảm ơn các bạn!

What’s the most popular e-wallet in VN right now and can foreigners sign-up to avail the service? Planning to use a mobile wallet (either GrabPay or Alipay) mainly for paying goods in malls and restaurants just to get by for less than 3 days in the city and I feel like I don’t necessarily need to withdraw cold, hard cash in DONG since I’ll be staying in my hotel anyway working most of the time.

Or vice versa, with exchange/international students, moving to the States and gaining so much weight. I’m wondering if the same could be said about Vietnam about the food quality, I know there’s a lot of processed food in every country but Vietnam is high on the list of countries with the healthiest diets! Does anyone have similar experiences with weight fluctuations while traveling between Vietnam and the States? I’m moving there soon and I’m really curious!

 I have a query regarding a travel route from Ho Chi Minh City to Krong Siem Reap. My preference is towards traveling by road as I have been told it's very economical compared to the flight. Along with that, I wish to know how comfortable that journey is and would you recommend it to someone who is traveling there for the first time.
 Looking forward for your helpful and insightful responses. I surely believe that I will have many more queries and I have utmost faith in the fact that most of them will be solved through this subreddit.

It would have been published sometime between May and August 1972 and features a Soldier standing on top of a tank on the cover. The magazine cover format is similar to this :https://nhacxua.vn/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chinh-luan.jpg 
 It features a family member of mine so I would happily pay a high price for a good quality scan of this cover or even more for the magazine itself or both. I'm not sure where to start, but wanted to reach out on Reddit in case anyone might know or even have this copy of the magazine. Thanks!

However a few people say Vietnamese made products are no better, usually citing (without sources) that Vietnam uses low-wage workers as well.
 Now unfortunately I am quite unaware of the living condition of Vietnamese workers. Would you say Vietnamese workers are generally better? I know it's not the best job but would you say it's good enough? Sometimes there's even absurd claim like slavery worker but I do not believe it happens in Vietnam (at least legally/endorsed). Would you say Vietnamese made products are more ethical? How would you respond to the above criticism?

We're all American (naturalized) citizens now and I don't think we have our Vietnamese citizenships (my parents currently live in Vietnam and they had to get a visa to do so). I'm handling some (American) paperwork for my parents and unfortunately they've requested a copy of my parents' birth certificates which we don't have. What would be the easiest way of getting this?
 From looking around online it sounds like my parents would have to get one from a Vietnamese embassy/consulate but it's a weird situation because they're not Vietnamese citizens anymore. My parents have US passports for reference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Coming April I wanna take a motorbike and travel through Vietnam for about 3 weeks. I have my European motorcycle license, so I'm fairly confident on the bike.
 I've always wanted to do a tour between Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, mainly riding through the mainland. However, after doing some research I get a lot of sources saying the north of Hanoi is the place to be.
 On one hand I'd love to get as much a vibe of Vietnam as possible, which seems the Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi would provide best. On the other hands, if the best sites are in the north, then I can totally be convinced to go there.
 Is there anyone who could give me some advice on this?
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, apologies for using English and the google translation below. 
 ​
 I LOVE FOOD!!! One of the most exciting parts of coming to Vietnam for me is learning about the culture and food that Vietnamese people are so beautifully famous for. 
 ​
 My problem(?) is that I have had gastric sleeve surgery so I can't eat much. Generally in Australia, my husband and I order one meal to share, but if I want something he can't eat or doesn't like, I will order my own meal and take the leftovers home to reheat later. That's going to be a little hard when I'm trying to eat as many different type of Vietnamese food as possible.
 ​
 Would it be offensive or "bad" for me to order a whole meal for myself and leave a lot of leftovers? I'd love for us to order 2 different Pho's and get to experience both but would it be a bad thing if we didn't eat it all? 
 Any tips on how to explain/apologise for my limited eating capacity will be well received!!!! PLEASE! 
 Google translate below:
 Xin chào tất cả, xin lỗi vì sử dụng tiếng Anh và bản dịch google bên dưới.
 ​
 TÔI YÊU THỰC PHẨM!!! Một trong những phần thú vị nhất khi đến Việt Nam đối với tôi là tìm hiểu về văn hóa và ẩm thực mà người Việt Nam vốn nổi tiếng xinh đẹp.
 ​
 Vấn đề của tôi (?) là tôi đã phẫu thuật dạ dày nên tôi không thể ăn nhiều. Thông thường ở Úc, vợ chồng tôi gọi một suất ăn để chia nhau, nhưng nếu tôi muốn món gì mà anh ấy không ăn được hoặc không thích, tôi sẽ gọi suất ăn của mình và mang phần thừa về nhà hâm nóng lại sau. Điều đó sẽ hơi khó khăn khi tôi cố gắng ăn càng nhiều loại thức ăn Việt Nam càng tốt.
 ​
 Gọi nguyên một suất ăn cho mình mà để lại nhiều thức ăn thừa thì có phản cảm hay “xấu” không? Tôi rất muốn chúng ta gọi 2 phở khác nhau và được trải nghiệm cả hai nhưng không ăn hết có phải là một điều tồi tệ không?
 Mọi lời khuyên về cách giải thích/xin lỗi về khả năng ăn uống hạn chế của tôi sẽ được đón nhận!!!! LÀM ƠN!

 Glad if anyone has experience with the topic and can help me.

 Everywhere I go, people constantly stare at me & when I do go into shops, I’ve been told I look Vietnamese. This happens when I speak english to them. I say thank you when I hear them, cause tbh Vietnamese women are beautiful & also didn’t know what to say in response. 
 Honestly, I’m not sure if I’m thinking too much into it but just wanted to know what it means? 
 I’m not Vietnamese (obviously lolol), just a traveler from another SEA country.
 Edit to add: I’m a female & motorcyclists stare at me while driving past. not sure if they’re just being creeps

We've been following the advice of only using Mai Linh / Vinasun or just walking, but a man at the rank queue guided us to a Saigon Tourist taxi at the queue. I thought he was the official taxi rank guide, but looking back obviously he was a partner / part of this particular taxi company.
 Taxi driver was chatty and had fairly good English, asking us about our home country.
 First issue was the exit toll - didn't realise there was one - he said we had to pay it, pointing to a sign on his sun visor. I asked how much and he wouldn't properly say, then as I looked in my wallet he reached over and grabbed it, went through the notes saying there were lots of big ones, and pulled one out. I really thought it was a 100k bill (but can't be sure) …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I plan to visit Vietnam, Da Nang around the end of January, 2023. I'm little bit concerned about Typhoons as in my home country we do not have anything relatively extreme. I read on news that Da Nang experienced Typhoon Noru - saw the videos, images and heard that there was an evacuation in thousands, so got scared a bit and thinking - maybe just go back to EU and sip beers there without worrying too much, haha. 
 I do plan to stay there for a month or two as DN. Anyone who have been there and can give any pro-tips about that place, please let me know down below. 
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My partner and I (Europeans) are traveling through VN while working remote. We did some research and asked our friends about their experiences and recommendations on this country.
 One couple in particular was very enthousiast about Da Nang. Said they could live there. Also, we read Da Nang is #3 hot spots in SeA. Based on these findings and recommendations, we booked ourself a good amount of time here.
 After spending 5 days in HCMC - which we really enjoyed - the experiences here in Da Nang didn’t really meet our expectations. We’re staying in the beach area, went to the city center, did Hai Van Pass & Ba Na Hills.
 We’re very curious about the history of this city. It feels like there’s put a lot of money into it years ago, but not very well maintained. Also they’re still building A LOT, while other properties seem unfinished.
 Is this city build to be Asias Dubai/Barcelona/Rio/Miami (since it has a beach)?
 We’re also looking for recommendations on what to do/see/eat here :)

 Use the other hand to clean butthole as well or does the gun itself is sufficient? How do you know? 
 How do you dry yourself off? Toilet paper of course but what if there's no TP? 
 Do you flush first then use gun or flush after?
 How do you deal with water splashes on toilet seat?
 Tricks/tips from your master of this subject is greatly appreciated!
 Edit: I've never use it before in the US and I've been here couple weeks. Sure it's not rocket science to use it, just interest on how people optimize the use of it. I'm sure there's a preferred method for a guy vs girl. 
 For me as a guy,since my junk, I lean forward and spray from the back. I tried spray only and use TP to check, sometimes it's clean and sometimes not. So I've use my left hand then with TP ready, wipe dry. This is where if you had a sink on top of the tank like some Japan toilet, you can wash your hands while sitting.

Sau một thời gian nói chuyện với tụi nó thì rút ra kết luận là kĩ năng nghe nói của mình quá kém T^T, nhất là khi nói chuyện với đứa UK và Úc. Không chỉ accent khác mà cách tụi nó đặt câu cũng khác quắc. Thí dụ khi gặp nhau UK hay hỏi "Have you done much today?" Lúc đầu mình nghe hổng ra cứ phải nghệt mặt ra hỏi lại, giờ nghe quen thì chỉ cần nó nói much là bắt bài được liền =)) nhưng vẫn là nghe được 50% của nó thôi không nghe ra được hết. Mình để ý cách tụi nó đặt câu hỏi và trả lời, và với cách mình được học cũng khác nữa, nhiều khi mình hỏi mà tụi nó không hiểu, nên thành ra ông gà bà vịt :))) để luyện tập thêm thì bên cạnh nói nhiều với tụi nó thì mình cũng coi show, program và để ý các nhân vật đối thoại rồi nhại theo, chứ cũng không biết còn cách nào khác không. Đặc biệt là nhiều khi muốn join conversation của tụi nó mà ko được cứ thấy vấp váp kiểu gì. Nói được 1 2 câu là ngưng nhảy số rồi. Mình muốn hỏi các bạn đã luyện kĩ năng nghe nói như nào vậy? Mình có tìm hiểu thì biết phải luyện theo intonation, schwa, diction. Các bạn luyện theo những phương pháp này thấy ổn hông? speaking của mình lúc trước cũng ko tệ lắm, 7.0 nhưng thấy cũng còn loay hoay quá. Hoan nghênh mọi ý kiến đóng góp. Any advice would help! Thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm interested in getting a better understanding of Vietnamese humor. What are some of your favorite funny shows or movies in Vietnamese? Preferably ones with English subtitles (but I know that's probably much rarer), as I am still learning Vietnamese and am not very good. The only movie on Netflix they had was Dreamy Eyes (Mất Biếc) which was a pretty good love story, but not a comedy.
 In no way am I making an assumption based on the tiny sample size of the shows available on Netflix, but is comedy less popular in Vietnam as a form of entertainment? I've also tried searching online other places besides Netflix and don't find much stuff about Vietnamese comedy. So what are some of your favorites you could recommend?

 I bought 1.2kg of coffee beans to experiment egg coffee, coconut, ice coffee, salted coffee and all kinds. 
 Any tips for this?? And is there a difference between aluminum and stainless steel phin? I bought the cheap 20-40,000 VND aluminum ones from the robusta coffee beans shop and it really doesn’t fit well. Hence, once I reach home, I bought the stainless steel one for about 80,000 VND and shipped it to my country.
 I was in a cafe and heard a song I really like but couldn’t capture the song name in time. When I reached home, I randomly searched for top Vietnam song and found “Sai gon Dau long qua”.
 What does it mean?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went on a trip to Da Nang and saw a lot of workers grinding concrete and working with dust using no dust mask or respirator. At first I though, well maybe people can't afford the respiratory, but a dust mask would still be useful for concrete dust and affordable. One could even wash and reuse them.
 Concrete dust is a pretty hazardous material to breath in. Perhaps there is less education on that? As I didn't actually know myself the first time I used it.
 Then of course the traffic is pretty aggressive and I understand the collision rate is rather high.
 So it just seems like safety isn't a top concern. Which is a shame because life is precious, IMO.

I’m not into touristy destinations. Solo traveler, looking for hidden gems of Vietnam. I recently went to Con Dao and loved it. Looking for something lesser known and off the beaten path. Not looking for a party atmosphere. Any recommendations off the beaten path? Cheap is good too. The least westerners the better. No offense.

 I am currently studying International Business in Asia course at Homeschool Rotterdam and I have a current project in which I need to determine consumer profiles in the Vietnamese fruit market. Thus, I am required to investigate this matter through field research.
 However, I don't know anyone in Vietnam and was wondering if you could help me fill out a survey that I need to have filled in by at least 100 Vietnamese people.
 The survey consists of 30 questions and it should not take longer than 10 minutes to complete. All data received will be used for study purposes only and will be kept strictly confidential. Furthermore, you will remain anonymous without having to enlist your name, email address, or other personal information.
 Would it be okay to post the link here on reddit, or would I get flagged for potential scam / fraud?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Just returned from Vietnam. My itinerary was roughly 4 days in tp HCM, 10 days up North in various places, then another 7 days back in HCM.
 I found that Hanoi was really active. Full of tourists, full of fun things happening. And most importantly, hotel accommodation was reasonably priced. Managed to get a good sized room with a balcony, at a good hotel, for around 650.000 in Hoàn Kiếm area, not five minutes walk from the lake. 
 By comparison, on my second stay in Saigon, best I could get was a passable room in a really cramped hotel with paper thin walls, for about 1000.000/n. I did scour Agoda and Booking.com for better deals, but there weren't many to be found. 
 And this despite there being very few tourists there (for some reason). That being the case, you'd think supply would exceed demand, and you'd get hotels dropping their prices in order to compete. 
 Another example: In my first 4 day stint in Saigon, I got a nice room with a balcony, in a nice but slightly run down hotel on Để Thám, for around 835.000. I would have booked them for my second stay too, but for some reason, they decided to double the price after I left. 
 I'm not whining. Just really puzzled by the economics of this.

No, I am not talking about people who fled as refugees. I am talking about people who intentionally overstay (permanently) their (tourist or student) visa in a foreign country.
 I have a relative who is considering this and work as a nail technician (in my opinion very bad route) and I would like to hear real stories or experience of people who have done it before.
 My main concerns and what I have told my relative are:
  
It's illegal and you are breaking the law (duh)
 You will have to pay a huge up front fee for this illegal service ($100k USD).
 You won't be able to work legally. Working illegally means terrible working condition and pay. It might take 7 - 10 years just to repay the fee + interests.
 You won't have life in these 7 - 10 years since you are trying to save every penny.
 You won't be able to return to Vietnam any time soon since you don't have legal documents.
  
Also, what is the best way to report this illegal activity to the authority (Vietnam or foreign country) without implicating my relative (financially or criminally)?

 Best I've seen so far on the internet is taking a minibus from Thanh Hoa to Sam Neua which is near Vieng Xai but curious if anyone has either 1) a better suggestion of getting near there from Hanoi directly since otherwise I would not visit Thanh Hoa or 2) something a bit more comfortable, since the bus from Thanh Hoa seems to be a cramped minivan with passengers shoved in with all sorts of produce/local goods and overall an uncomfortable ride compared to the great coach busses in Vietnam. Thank you!

 When I reach home, I couldn’t fit the filter press into the chamber covering the grounds properly and found out that the ones I bought are too cheap to be authentic.
 I just wanna ask the Vietnamese here which are the actual? Is there an actual one? Is it made of stainless steel? Or there is nothing wrong with my aluminum cheap phin and it’s meant to be like that and all I have to do is to just sand paper it down ?
