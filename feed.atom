        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone - I've spent the last few days combing through all your posts on traveling Vietnam, lots of helpful stuff so thanks to everyone. Currently planning on flying to Hanoi mid Sept, spending a couple days there and bussing to Ha Giang, doing the loop on motorbike then coming back. 
 My bday is at the end of the trip and I'd like to splurge a little at a luxury-ish resort or something where I can really chill out and be taken care of. From what I've read so far, current top of the list is Da Nang, but just wanted to see if anyone has any other good recs. 
 Wants
 -Remote-ish, not overly touristy but still some kind of town action we can walk to for food, beers, etc.
 -Resort with a pool, preferably overlooking the beach
 -Proximity to other towns/beaches so we can rent scooters and go on little day trips
 Recommendations on Towns or actual resorts would be amazing!

Education is efficient and not stressful while work culture isn't as intense. Vietnamese students have more extracurricular activities to do such as football compared to Chinese students who study day and night from the start of life to prepare for the gaokao. Vietnamese suicide rates are much lower than Japan's or South Korea's.
 What cultural/social/political developments led to Vietnamese culture being more chill?

 I’m a 25 year old guy, coming from Canada. Will be in Saigon from Feb 13-23, then over to Hanoi.
 I’ll be around the District 1 area (in general, still confirming Airbnb) and I’d like to see if anyone wants to be friends? Or do some tourist things together?
 I love food and would like to try as much as I can around the area! I love experiencing new things, and getting tattoos. 
 I’m also open to any local ideas of things to do around the area, or day trips for motorcycle?
 Send me a DM, or comment!

I have not fully decided, but I'm leaning heavily on the smaller 150cc for less weight and fuel economy. I have past experience with 300cc-600cc motorbikes but it doesn't make sense to ride the bigger bikes in Vietnam. I'm looking to ride around town and occasional long rides.
 I'm open to getting the R3 or Ninja 400 as well.
 Please let me know what your best experiences are and what makes good sense. (Note: I will have an Airblade in case I'm lazy.)
 Thanks in advance!

 I wasn't raised In n Asian household so I was slowly learning about my Viet culture 
 I went to a Vietnamese restaurant, and I couldn't finish all my food, and I felt really bad about it.... because I didn't want to leave a bad impression. I heard that it's seen as wasting food, and is also disrespectful to the chef in other east Asian cultures just didn't know if it was the same for Viet. I feel really bad about it.

My dad got an MBA during the 1990s, and he went back home to work for an insurance company. My mom obtained a law degree in Vietnam and worked in a different field. My question is: what kind of jobs can my parents do? Obviously, I will be the person who helps them start over and climb the social ladder, but at the same time, I don't want them to struggle in old age. Can my dad start over and work at a company with his US degree, even though it will take several years to adjust and improve his English? What kind of jobs can my mom do? I have heard a lotta became nail techs, but I'm unsure if she could handle all the drama and long working hours. I honestly love them so much for all the work they put in to send me here, so at least I want to help them with a new life :( If any of yall in similar boats, I would love to hear yall your experiences!!

If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it. I have most of the journey mapped out but there's not much english language travel out there for Thanh Hoa so it's hard to find exactly where they are. 
 I remember going to 1) a tourist destination of a river with a lot of fish, and 2) a medium/large busy indoor/outdoor market on the way to Sam Son which had amazing pho and lots of street food. I don't remember and apparently didn't write down anywhere the names or specific locations of either of these places and google isn't helping me. I would love to know if these places still exist and if so exactly where they are :D Any help would be very appreciated, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently in HCMC and am flying home on Thursday from Hà Nội. I’m assuming that due to new year, the flights direct are both expensive and almost non existent.
 Flight searching tools show most routes stop off at Phu Quoc. On my final day before going to Hà Nội, should I get an early flight to Phu Quoc, spend the day there (with my luggage which could be a pain) and then fly later into Hà Nội. Or am I better off getting flights closer together and spending less time on the island? 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're planning to visit Vietnam in late march for a couple of weeks, we want to spend a week in Hanoi and a week in Ho Chi Minh. I'd kind of rather play things by ear when we get there, book our flights and hotels now and then when we get there do some things like river tour or an overnight cruise. But I'm not sure how crucial it is to book those things in advance. When we get there, can we talk to the hotel about booking a cruise or a guided tour or will it be difficult to locate those with short notice?

If so, do you pay customs and duties when you receive it back home? I’m wondering if I just deal with it and carry a few suits for the next 3.5 months, or if it makes sense to pay the shipping to Canada and then potentially pay the customs and duties on it. 
 I’m not sure how the process works, but it seems like this can be quite an expensive endeavour. Any advice would be appreciated! 
 Thanks!

 Just wanted to hear people's story so I can share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm currently planning on a trip to Vietnam and thinking through transportation around the city- specifically grab availability to and from my hotels to the airport. Some of my hotels do offer airport transportation, but I can't figure out if their quoted prices are a serious upcharge compared to Grab.
 I've been to other countries before where ride share apps are available, but cars are limited (eg, it takes 30-40 minutes to get a car and the car cancels multiple times.) Is this a cause for concern with Grab in Vietnam?
 Hoping to ask for your insight about transportation and the reliability, availability, and pricing of Grab in:
  
Saigon Airport to District 3 around 11pm: Are cars available at this time? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
 Hanoi airport to old town: I believe I've read on a Reddit thread that the car picking you up is not the one the app promised. Is this still the case? What would the pricing be?
 Halong Bay port to Van Don Airport: This is the one I'm worried about the most. Is Grab availability quick here? If not, does anyone have recommendations on how to get to the airport? Any companies you use that you recommend?
 Da Nang Airport to Hoi An: Are grabs available and reliable here? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
  
As a female, my primary concern is safety, reliability, and flexibility. Our group is 3 people: will this change the type of car we need for Grab?
 Thank you so much for any insight you can give on any of these cities and your experiences in transportation here! I really really appreciate it.

 Does anyone have thoughts on what can I do to help and raise awareness? There's a stigma going on to not help them for fear of scams or something but wth... they are doing what they are doing because they need the money or it's their livelihood. 
 What's especially bothering me are the tourists! Like what are you doing bargaining with the locals? You have the privilege and luxury of travelling well and stuff, paying a little extra and giving them a better life. 
 Sorry, I was venting a little bit back to the topic, what can I do to help? I've been giving money here and there and it's endless. I'm buying stuff I don't need and I don't know what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 So, I'm suffering from misophonia. Misophonia basically means you react extremely sensitive to some sounds. Not just - I don't like that sound - but full on rage / anxiety / panic / fear / aggression triggered immediately upon being subjected to it. It can be conditional though - meaning a sound only triggers that reaction in some context but not in others.
 Sounds like that for me are bass from music (no problem with bass from music I hear myself or when going to a night club but when trying to sleep f.x.). People smacking while eating. 
 Now - why do I direct this question specifically at Vietnamese people and not expats or tourists reading this? Well, Vietnam is a very loud culture and to make things worse sound proofing of buildings here doesn't seem to exist. At least I have never "seen" any. Windows especially are always leaking air and because of that sound from outside.
 So, I'd assume that a misophonically challenged person would be suffering a lot. But, is misophonia even a problem here? Maybe being subjected to very loud sounds all the time since birth provides immunity to it? Do you know of Vietnamese misophonics - are you one yourself? What are your triggers? How do you cope? How do you arrange yourself with it?
 Cheers

 Do you recommend hiring a driver or simply taking a Grab?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 1.5 year old who I’m trying to teach some Vietnamese. She currently learns a ton of classic American songs like, “Wheels on the Bus” or “Old Macdonald”. I’ll usually look for the Vietnamese version but it’s just not the same. 
 Are there any classic or kids songs that y’all can recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody, my wife and I booked a flight from Vientiane to Hanoi for January 15th through 12go.asia. I made a dumb mistake and put in the wrong last name, her birth name instead of the name she has now after the marriage. After being in contact with support from 12go.asia, they informed me that you have to request the change at least 3 days before departure date. I know it was my mistake but I just can't believe that you can't change something like this before the flight. Does anybody have experience with this? Could we just show up at the airport and try to change it there? Would we have to cancel the whole booking or could we just buy a new ticket for her and I could keep my booking, even though I made a booking for 2 people? Thanks in advance in case anybody could give me information on this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla has recently decreased its Model Y prices from $66,000 to only $53,000 and the Model Y Performance now starts at only $57,000 with a 0-60 time of 3.5 seconds and 303 miles of range as well (down from 330 miles on the Base Model Y). With the Vinfast VF 8 still starting at $59,000 despite having less track record than Tesla, what do you now think of the Vinfast VF 8 and what are your opinions of Vinfast now, given the fact the Tesla Model Y is now cheaper (in fact, the 7-seat interior on the Model Y is only $4000 more than the 5-seat interior)?
 I am also curious who would buy the Vinfast over the Tesla Model Y, if any, outside of Vietnam, and what measures Vinfast would need to address to succeed, or they would fail regardless?
 For me, I do think Vinfast should just halve their price to be competitive:
 The Vinfast VF 8 could be $29k trying to steal market share from the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5/CX-50, Hyundai Santa Fe/Tucson, Kia Sorento/Sportage, Nissan Rogue, Mitsubishi Outlander, Subaru Forester, etc.
 The Vinfast VF 9 could be $42k trying to steal market share from the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Mazda CX-9, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Nissan Pathfinder, Subaru Ascent, Chevy Traverse, Ford Explorer, etc.
 I am actually Vietnamese by the way, born in Vietnam and currently living in the US and after seeing Tesla prices drop, if I had to choose between the Tesla Model Y and the Vinfast VF 8, I would choose the Tesla Model Y Long Range. Also, a review of the 'quirks and features' of the Vinfast VF 8 will be coming soon as I am heading to Montreal this weekend to film a video over at the Vinfast store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I am currently working on writing a novel in which one of the main characters is Vietnamese-American. He was raised in a family culture that is supposed to be relatively traditional as per Vietnamese values and lifestyle, so I'm trying to do some research into what that looks like, especially in everyday life.
 So here's my question: are there any particular details or things I should include to make traditional Vietnamese life feel accurate and respectful? Are there any potentially harmful stereotypes I should avoid? I want to get a more direct authority on the subject than decades old library books and internet articles. Thanks in advance for your help!

 Facebook basically ate up every chat log and every low res videos that provided zero context whatsoever, then people started taking it on Reddit and Twitter. I've never laugh so hard on such a clownfest. Heck, I can even pretend to leak a Zalo chatlog saying "Oh I'm a relative of the two students on the press conference today, they were forced to answer in favor of "the upper people" " and people would gobble them up like a bowl of warm soup.

 I want to clarify that I do not wish to spread misinformation, but it is important that we put pressure on the military school, the university itself (HUFLIT) and the media to be fully transparent about the situation.
 Many posts on Facebook and Twitter related to this have been removed after the incident blew up on social media.
 According to an official statement in a press conference from the military school, this incident was a conflict between female students, with one of them accused of stealing, causing her to breakdown and scream. Later on, her family came to pick her up.
 There are also 2 female students present at the conference: one of them filming the video and the other one being the suppo…]]></summary>

Why is there no name mentioned in the story? I mean not just the confession but all the messages, voice chats and videos that are claimed to be related to it. Isn't that too strange? Especially when some claimed one of the supposed victims is well known by many people and has a father who's a general. How come her name not mentioned even once?
 
The details of the story changed by a lot. Initially it was claimed that a teacher was passing by before discovering the incident and saving the girls (there was a suprisingly lack of details on how he confronted the rapists and saved the girls). Then somehow the story changed from 2 girls being caught on the road to being brought into a room by an off…]]></summary>

We're both foreigners: I'm American while she's Vietnamese. The process requires a lot of paperwork most of the difficult part coming from her side.
 We've run into a snag where it seems her local Vietnamese government is asking for documentation about me before issuing the documents she needs from them. Though according to her my documents aren't required and it's just the government being stupid.
 Does anyone here have experience getting the Giấy xác nhận tình trạng hôn nhân and Giấy xác nhận chưa thụ lý đăng ký kết hôn when marrying a foreigner? Did you need documents for them in order to get these documents?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[TW - rape, suicide]
 Recently there have been stories on Vietnamese Facebook about female students being supposedly raped by other male soldiers at a military school, where they had to go and stay 2 weeks for military training (which is compulsory for most university students in Vietnam). After the assault, there has also been rumors that 2 of them has attempted to commit suicide, with 1 of them successfully killing herself.
 The first video is the screams during the incident. When the girl screamed for help, it could be heard that one of the guy shouted 'Banh rộng chân ra', which roughly means 'Spread your legs out'.
 The second one is the body being carried away after one of the students committed suicide.
 After the stories went viral on Facebook, the military school published a notice about the subject passing it off as 'internal conflict' and that 'no harm was caused'. The official Facebook page of the university (HUFLIT) has posted this document on their offical pages.
 Other images are messages from the fellow students at the school.

 To know more, it is helpful to go on Twitter and search for the keyword 'HUFLIT'.

I recently found out that Ha Dong used be part of a now defunct province called Ha Tay which was absorbed by Ha Noi in 2008 creating the city we know today. I often drive through Nguyen Trai street to Ha Dong and I often wonder what was the actual border between the two cities prior to 2008? Its hard to tell since most of the area between Ha Noi and Ha Dong has been built up over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I have been trying to do my part in learning about Tet. I really love the culture. I was invited this year to go on a trip with my husbands family (who moved here along with my husband from vietnam only a few years ago), to participate in a more cultural lunar new year than their typical. They live in america, and since moving here they just stay home for the holiday. It seems that they are very excited to go on this trip, and i want to show my appreciation in any way possible. There is a strong language barrier between us, we mostly only communicate through my husband. I am wondering, what are some possible gifts i can bring them to show them my appreciation? I have done my research, but as an outsider i do not want to overstep and i feel a little insecure about giving them traditional gifts. I need to know if this is just me. For example, would it be overstepping if i wore a red dress? Or would it excite them that i want to participate like that? Would i be weird if i brought them lucky flowers? Any insight at all would be very appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like history, and I also know that the war waged in Vietnam is one of the biggest tragedies in the 20th century. Recently I came to know about a documentary about it made by Ken Burns. I want to know if someone here watched it and what is your opinion on that documentary.
 Edit: I think it's somewhat stupid to say "Vietnam War". Sounds like the fault is yours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year will be the first Tet with my boyfriend, he's Vietnamese and I'm white. He used to celebrate pretty heavily with his immediate and extended family when he was younger, but the whole family has since stopped celebrating like they used to and I want to start up the celebrations again with him this year since I think it could be really nostalgic for him. I plan to decorate and cook, but what about gifts?
 I know that traditionally gifts of money are usually given to younger members of the family, so would it be weird if I got him a gift? I just really love gift giving and will look for any excuse to get him presents, but I don't want it to be weird if it seems inappropriate for this particular holiday. If it wouldn't be weird, what are some possible gift ideas that would be fitting? He really loves white tea, hates sweet things, and is always appreciative of plants if that helps.
 I remember him fondly reminiscing on the fun of red envelopes, and since it would be kind of awkward to give him money I had the idea of using the red envelopes to make a scavenger hunt for him. Thoughts on this idea? Too weird? Brutal honesty is appreciated, I'm still learning but it's hard to get an idea of what he would enjoy for Tet without spoiling the surprise of all my plans
 Thanks so much for any and all help!

This involves me lying face down in the water (using a snorkel and mask). Of course this will look odd to anyone who isn’t familiar with freediving and in the few instances I’ve had of actually trying this resulted in either getting shouted at by the lifeguard or they simply don’t allow anything that isn’t circuit or lane swimming. 
 How would I ask about whether I could do some freedive practice on the surface? My practice partner relies on me speaking Vietnamese for stuff but I don’t know how to say this.

She said of course, (I've tutored her daughters and we've visited together before). Afterwards they invited us in for drinks (it was just my husband and I and her, her husband and kids), and now she says they've had great luck this past year (good health, built a big new house, etc.) so she would like us to be officially invited for the evening this year lol. At the big new house they built. 
 Last time was just spur of the moment. I get a bit overwhelmed about the times during Tet when you do the specific things etc - I was just wondering if I should prepare a gift that would be "lucky"? She's always been helpful and friendly to us, but I'd like to show my appreciation in a culturally appropriate way. For example, I only recently learnt that you can't give certain flowers (the yellow chrysanthemum) as gifts, though luckily I've never done that. Would just like to know if there's a "special" gift that would be appreciated. Feel quite honored to be invited to be the first into her home in the new year!

I am a seasoned backpacker and really wanting great food and culture (for context I'm from Melbourne), I will also be travelling with my mum for a period who's VERY Korean but want some nice experiences. Struggling to find a travel blog or anything online I'm really resonating so hoping this community can give me some insights. 
 Food wise I would love street food, cool bars, places where locals eat and drink, areas where younger tourists go to socialise, where young locals go to socialise. 
 Is it worth doing a few days elsewhere? 
 Sorry, I know i'm asking a lot but any type of response will be gladly appreciated. Much love!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He's the guy who was posting those "predator hunter" videos from HCMC. He seemed to be posting pretty frequently up until about 2 weeks ago when everything stopped. No updates from his Facebook page, and his YouTube account seems to have been deleted. I just want to make sure he's ok. Although he was doing a good thing, it's still a very risky venture in Vietnam. I'm curious what happened. Does anyone know anything?

 For context is, the relative open a chocolate shop in Saigon and it isn't doing well. She commented that Vietnamese doesn't like chocolate as much as coffee.
 Any insights to why choco is less favourable ?

We already have our stay booked in Hanoi, a cruise in Ha Long Bay and we have a list of places (mostly popular tourist attractions) which we would like to visit. I was hoping if you guys could give any tips and advises for our trip? Is there anything that we must see, any dishes we should try (I am aware of Egg Coffee, Pho and Bun Cha which we can get in Hanoi)? Is there anything that we should be cautious of (any scams etc.)?
 We are all very excited to come to Vietnam and explore it! Any advice will be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I have an odd question. One of my neighbors is Vietnamese, and we live in the United States.
 I've been noticing at night a red light in their living room. They do not have curtains. It looks like 2 urns? And some other things that I can't make out. It looks like it's in a case of some sort. And there is 2 red lights on at all times, from what I can tell. 
 I was thinking it could be for a reptile, because I was going to offer them some of my old reptile keeping items, but my husband reminded me that they are Vietnamese and it could be a cultural thing. 
 I don't want to be rude by assuming, so is this something done in your culture? 
 Thank you all so much!

 I’m 25f, enjoys nature a lot, meeting people, and good food. I wanted to ask your personal recommendations on which spots I shouldn’t miss? From food, to nearby spots?
 The places I’m eyeing to visit are: - About 1-2 days in Hanoi - Hoi An - Ninh Binh - And Ha Long Bay.
 Questions:
  
Would it be good to spend 1 day in each town?
 What would be a good itinerary?
 Is Ha Long Bay worth it? Other towns you love?
 Food/ restos I shouldn’t miss in these places?
  
Thank you so much! ❤️

One is in duong dong town and the other one is in an thoi at the very southern tip of the island. Which one would be more convenient? We like to eat so does the west side have more restaurants than the south? We will be flying in but plan to do a boat tour to visit surrounding islands also.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pho is one of my favourite dishes. If it is not one of yours then there is something fundamentally wrong with you! I know its sensible to parboil your bones first to remove any impurities and get a clearer broth. However is it acceptable/correct to roast the bones first? This is pretty standard practice when making a broth in the west but I believe in doing things properly.

 I went out to the grocery store and some Vietnamese came to and told me he have some “pretty girls” and tried to show me some of their photos. I refused to him of course and went into the store but he took a picture of me and sent it to someone. It was very creepy! Has it happened to someone here? Why did he do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What social/cultural/political developments led to Vietnam becoming less authoritarian than China?
 Vietnam has access to Western sites while China blocks most. 
 China cares about policing the internet more than Vietnam, and China cares about policing cultural works than Vietnam. Yes, Vietnamese movies have some serious censorship but at least they can still make ghost movies and homosexual relationship content.
 Vietnamese leaders can more easily accept criticism from their citizens while Chinese leaders are less tolerant of criticism. Vietnam’s security minister was criticized for eating at a Salt Bae restaurant in London and had to resign. In China, many major scandals are heavily censored and covered up.
 What reasons make the Vietnamese government less authoritarian and more humane than the Chinese government?
 If it’s a case of losing authority? Why is the Vietnamese government more prone to make decisions that risk their authority than the Chinese government is?
 Is the higher humaneness of the Vietnamese government stemming from cultural reasons?
 Vietnam is still repressive and has one of the world’s worst press freedom scores, but the fact that they have access to all Western sites and more political accountability is a clear sign that it is much less authoritarian than China.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I just got engaged two months ago, I’ve been thinking about getting a customized ao dai for both my fiancé and I for our wedding. I’m located in the US and was wondering how much is a customized ao dai over in VT? My mom is currently visiting Da Nang and she went around looking for ao dais and couldn’t find anything to her/my liking, she told me that the colors and prints are for the spring season or for tet. I don’t mind waiting since I’m still planning my wedding, I don’t need it right away but just want to look and find the print and fabric that I like. She also told me the cost for two ao dais are roughly $500-$600 US dollars, does this cost sound right? I told my mom I don’t mind paying for that price but she kept telling me that it’s expensive. If anyone has any recommendations for places for a customized ao dais I would really appreciate it!

These articles only talk about how South Vietnam affirmed and exercised its sovereignty on the islands, but they don't say anything about what North Vietnam did, not even lips service. Did North Vietnam do or say anything?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, so I’m travelling to Vietnam next week and there are some things I’m worried about. 
 I’m currently on medication and I’m curious if I’m allowed to bring that into Vietnam? Do I need some kind of receipt or certification from my doctor to prove that the medicine belongs to me? I’m scared they’ll seize it at the airport.
 I’m also a very physically active person, and I plan on working out while I’m in Saigon. I’m taking creatine, and I have been pretty consistent with it so I don’t wanna stop now. I want to bring it to Vietnam but I’m a bit nervous. It’s a white powder. What if they think it’s cocaine and they confisticate it? But I’m guessing they have trained dogs for that?
 Maybe I’m taking this too seriously. I’m on vacation and I should enjoy it, and not think so much about the gym. What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to recall some of the stuffs I have read during this period of time. Some of the literature was of Viet origin. But some wasn't. I finally remembered series like Animorphs, Ngũ quái Sài Gòn, etc.
 In particular, I recalled reading some teen mystery/detective book. I could have been written before the 90s. But I remember reading it in the late 90s to either 2000/2001. There is not much more to go on. Outside of the fact that I know it isn't Sherlock Holmes, Detective Conan, or TKKG (another series that I was searching for). Hope you guys can help. Thank in advance. I am sure there should only be a handful of series and or books about teenage detectives during this time.

The timeline seems a little rushed, and it would be nice to leave the weekend before. Unfortunately taking more time off afterwards isn't an option due to work deadlines, so it would have to be before. But since Tet is on Jan 22, would it be a waste of two days of PTO to leave on Jan 21 instead of Jan 25, since everything might be closed?

 Do you have any suggestion for local independent or underground culture, especially in HCMC and Hanoi? Artist run spaces and collectives, experimental music (new music, noise, electronic, performance/sound art), cultural/social projects for local independent artists and musicians, queer communities, etc? 
 Although I won't miss some obvious touristic spot I would like to see and support some of the local scene. Never been in Vietnam so I don't know what to expect :)

 I'm in Hanoi with my fiancee and we're looking for a USB C to HDMI cable so I can connect my phone to the TV at the hotel we're staying at. I've gone to a few shops in the Old Quarter and came back empty.
 I'll be away until Monday evening but would love if there's a way to order one and have it shipped to the hotel on the weekend or Monday. The concierge at the hotel tried but was unsuccessful.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends! Next week I’m travelling to Vietnam with my mother and we’ll be staying there for three weeks. Last time I went to Vietnam was in 2015 so I’m pretty excited. 
 We’ll be spending the first week in Saigon, second week at my grandparents to celebrate Tet, and the third week in Phu Quoc Island. 
 There is one thing I’m worried about and that’s losing my phone. I’m worried about getting it stolen while in Saigon. It’s pretty crowded there so I’m a bit paranoid. 
 My phone is super important to me so I don’t wanna lose it. I’ll be wearing a fanny pack and I want to take a lot of photos and record videos while I’m there. 
 That’s also the problem. What if someone walks past me and snatches my phone while I’m recording? Or if someone on a motorcycle drives by and snatches it.
 When I was in Vietnam in 2015, I was just a child so I didn’t have a phone at the time so there was nothing to worry about. Anyone got some advice? What should I think about? 
 I’d also appreciate suggestions on nice restaurants and places to visit!

I won’t be doing any off road trails and plan on travelling the north and venturing into Laos and Cambodia after. 99% of the time I’ll be travelling without a passenger. I’m 185cm(6’0) & 75kg(165lbs); I’ll be carrying around 10kg of luggage. I’m leaning towards the future 125: It’s semi auto, lighter than the 150 and the parts are more widely available. Is the 125 sufficient or would you recommend the 150?

We are currently up to date with Hep A, Tetanus, Rabies and Typhoid, as well as the usual vaccines you get as a child in the UK (Mumps, Measles, Rubella, Polio, HPV) Is there anything else that anyone would recommend? We can't currently find anywhere that is offering Japanese Encephalitis vaccinations, so I'm also wondering if we will be safe to travel without this one? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is this a common thing in Vietnam? I admittedly haven't been travelling a whole lot since the pandemic so haven't been paying much attention to other places. But it seems a lot businesses have what look to be obviously fake 5 star reviews on google maps, far more so than other places (Mostly accounts that have only given 1 review ever). It's hard to gauge what businesses are reliable, as it seems so many businesses do it, even ones that are 'good' or have been around for a long time. I've also seen a few 1 start reviews that seem like smears, which may somewhat explain why businesses try to counter it
 Are there other websites people check to find how reliable a business is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone, I (30s F) will be visiting Vietnam for about three weeks this mid- February. I'm looking for a travel buddy for activities such as hiking, walking, cultural exploration, volunteer, eco friendly tour... if you are planning to travel around Hanoi and througout Vietnam during this time and want more company, please let me know. I will be based in Hanoi and ideally looking for day trip, or out of town 2-4 days then ilback to Hanoi. 
 I was born and grew up in the Old Quarter of Hanoi but have been living oversea since 19yo. I still have many friends and family in Vietnam. I just visited Vietnam end of last year so have catched up on most family/friends and gatherings. I also realized my recreational interests have changed now (probably due to age and living in NZ) and more into activities such as town/market walk around, hiking, walking track, cultural experience...my friends in VN will just take me to a cool cafe or new restaurant everytime and i have started to feel I have enough of it. 
 So if you are like-minded, I would love to hear from you.

In Vietnam is there a way to get near the Chinese ‘borderline’ (not the actual passport control etc) but just so i can say that i’ve been to the border and maybe take a cool picture without being in a vehicle having to actually cross the border? Just thought it would be quite cool. This could be completely impossible but was just curious, thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi! my mom is from rural southern vietnam, and my dad is from hue. i grew up in the U.S. and am pretty detached from my roots. i never learned the language, and most of my vietnamese friends are the same way.
 my mom made a comment last week that made me wonder about the regional stereotypes in vietnam. she said that she originally never wanted to marry someone from hue because she thought they were stingy and cheap with money. i can also tell that there’s many differences in food preference, accent, personality, etc.
 what are some other differences and stereotypes between the regions in vietnam? is there a difference between rural and urban southerners as well? my parents often joke about my mom is a farm girl at heart, so i’d love to know.

I suppose they're trying to cut budget (or encourage us to work more??). What's your take on this? Is this even legal according to the labour laws for foreigners in VN?
 Please note: I'm not naming and shaming, I just want to have a better understanding of this so I can weight my options (either to stay or leave).
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just returned home after 3-ish years in a god forsaken frozen corn field and noticed that there are now these yellow license plates everywhere. They're on buses, taxis, ubers/grabs, trucks, etc. I also noticed that some of the yellow plates also have "contract vehicle" (xe hợp đồng) stickered somewhere on the frame or windows.
 ​
 What do these yellow plates mean? Are they like company/corporate vehicles or something? The one commonality I can find is that they are all work/commercial vics of some sort (as opposed to private/personal transport).
 ​
 I could have sworn that there weren't these yellow plates back before I left. I'm almost certain that back then all the taxis, busses, and grabs still used the normal white plates. Did something change while I was away freezing my ass off?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone As the title suggests, I am loving my time in Vietnam, except for the bureaucratic headache of dealing with my lost luggage. 
 Simply put, on 26 December 2022, my luggage did not arrive, and I followed all the usual steps of filling out a lost luggage form, and notifying my original airline, JetStar. Of course, JetStar is blaming Vietnam airlines, who connected my flight from Saigon to Hanoi. I am now trying to submit a compensation claim with Vietnam Airlines, but all the resources point me to the general information and the form, which I have already filled out. My question is simply what email address do I contact/who do I send my claim to at Vietnam Airlines?
 I’m already past the 7 day notification period but given my deadlings with tracing and that I’ve been out of reception for much of my time here I’m hopeful I can shake them down. 
 Thanks so much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time ago I had dinner at a restaurant in NYC called Le Colonial. It was a high-end Viet-French Fusion kind of place. The dish I had was called Bo Sate. It was beyond good and I've not been able to forget about it. I want so badly to be able to make it at home.
 It was made with beef tenderloin (Bo), and had a sauce (Sate?) which included sweet potatoes and green string beans. My search for Bo Sate recipes only turns up Thai sate recipes, which is not the same.
 I really appreciate any hints or suggestions you can offer.

 I’m looking to move somewhere else in Asia after having lived in Thailand for 4 years. I wonder how it’s like to live in Vietnam in terms of access to international food like imported beef and other groceries, can they be found in the supermarkets there? How long does the visa on arrival last? Are the prices on food and living generally low compared to in western countries? What about transportation, is it advisable to rent a motorbike? Are the hospitals and healthcare up to the same or similar standards as in Thailand? Are fitness centres well equipped with modern machines?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a mortgage for an apartment that started at 9.1%. every year they increased by about 1 or 2% which I wasn't so happy but it was in my tolerant level so I didn't complain. Tonight I just received a message that this year it would be 15.4%, up from 12.9 from last year. I don't have the contract right now but I will check later to see if this is even legal. I remember there maybe some thing like maximum increment of 2% a year. The bank is TPB btw.
 Is this a normal thing? Is the rate too high for current market? Is there anything I should do?
 Update: thank you everyone, this looks like a market thing. I hope everyone is doing well financially. These rates really suck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a story in which a foreigner will be reading part of a Nguyen Trai poem in Vietnamese. The poem is Bình Ngô đại cáo. The passage I have selected is this:
 Nguỵ đảng hoài gian, cánh dĩ mãi ngã quốc.
 Hân thương sinh ư ngược diệm,
 Hãm xích tử ư họa khanh.
 Khi thiên võng dân, quỷ kế cái thiên vạn trạng;
 I have a two questions about this. The first is about translations. I don't trust Google Translate and it's hard to track down a good translation online. Can anyone help?
 The second question might be harder. I want the foreigner to mispronounce one of the words so that it changes the meaning to something kind of funny. Are there any words in there that could change to something silly if they are spoken with the wrong tone? 
 I can always choose a different passage if this one doesn't work, but I want the content of the poem to be about war.

As a foodie, I'm fascinated with all the food shops, restaurants, stalls in Hanoi. I noticed that most of the restaurants are generally 100% women-lead from cooking to servicing and to billing. Why? The rare exception I noticed so far are restaurants 100% ruled and managed by men, and these are thai-ish food related and generally by stylish men. Is there any sort of explanation? Thanks :)

 This is going to be our third time visiting Việt Nam. Until now, we mostly used air planes and trains. This time we would like to spend more time, so we would like to go in smaller steps to see more places. It seems the usual way to travel is by bus. How does the bus system work in general and after Covid? Is there one public transportation system or are there also privat companies. Would you also take taxies into account? When should we use which kind of transportation? Our route currently looks like the following:
 Sài Gòn -> Mỹ Tho -> Cần Thơ -> Sài Gòn -> Phan Thiết and Phan Rang <-> Đà Lạt <-> Buôn Ma Thuột -> Tuy Hòa -> Quy Nhơn -> Pleiku -> Kon Tum -> Hôi An and Đà Nẵng (<-> denotes that the order is not yet decided)
 Our plan is to take the train where applicable.
 Though, this is only the first half of our route as we would like to continue our route to Hà Nội in a similar style for another 30 days, but we have not looked into it too much yet. We hope this is a reasonable route to travel.

 We've already spent a few days in Hanoi and did Ha Long Bay, and while we love it we don't want to spend another 9 days there after Phu Quoc (leaving on the 13th). I've been looking at Ninh Binh / Tam Coc as an option for a 3 day stay, but all tours seem to leave from Hanoi to that area, and everything I'm reading says to do that area on a scooter but I don't have a bike license and my partner isn't comfortable driving one on her own.
 Is finding local tours easy in that area?. Any other suggestions for the north of Vietnam?. We're not the backpacking types, both middle aged and enjoy a certain amount of comfort :)
 Thanks!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I came down from central VN to Saigon for the weekend with my family. We stayed in an apartment at VinHomes Central Park, largely because it was convenient to get to the NYE fireworks on the river. Like, a ten minute walk. Along with a large crowd, we waited for the midnight fireworks to start. 
 And waited... and waited... and waited...
 At 12:20, we gave up and took the kids back to the apartment. When we got back, I turned on the TV and loaded the live stream of the Saigon fireworks. Nothing but streams of people leaving the riverside.
 When I got up this morning, I checked the local news, hoping to find an explanation. One news site, VN Express, had a glowing report of the festivities in HCMC along with photos of the "fireworks display":
 Vietnam rings in 2023
 This was the only reference I could find, so I've started the new year off with a mystery.

 Since January 2020, the Đài Tiếng nói Việt Nam article consistently blows out all daily viewership metrics:
  
February 2020 -- narrowly beats front page with 32k views.
 
March 2020 -- destroys it with 50k hits over 30k
 
August 2021 -- 3rd after front page and Taliban
 
April 2022 -- dwarfs everything else with 81k views. The next non-special article is about a dude named Tô Anh Dũng has measly 11k.
 
December 2022 -- still going strong with a 2nd place after front page
 
 I don't think it ever left top 3 for the past three years, no other article across the entire wikimedia comes even close.
 Is it tradition to read about Voice of Vietnam during breakfast, or did some popular site embed the article into their front page somehow? Any inside would be greatly appreciated 👐

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife (Canadian) and I (British) are going on our honeymoon to Vietnam, but intend to visit Thailand for a few days midway, before returning to Vietnam for the last portion before flying home. 
 The official guidance for British citizens is that 15 days single entry is allowed without a visa, then you have to wait 30 days till you try to enter again. I've seen claims that the "30 days untill you re-enter" rule isn't really enforced and that you can just re-enter again on the 15 day rule, but I'm not sure I want to test that theory based on unsubstantiated claims...
 So my plan currently is to use the 15 days for the first entry, then apply for an E-Visa as soon as I get to Vietnam, print it somewhere, and use it when I re-enter Vietnam the second time from Thailand. 
 Do any British people have experience leaving and returning to Vietnam as a tourist in one trip? What did you do?

I’m not sure if I should even stop by if I need to leave so soon - I don’t want to make it seem like I’m not enjoying spending time with them. I need to leave early because I have a huge trip the next day.
 Question: What should I bring to their house and should I stop by if I can’t stay for very long?

 I'm not biased, just interested in hearing inspiring or cynical stories, either is good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I come from a developing country that can be compared to Vietnam in many ways. But the main difference is the apparent tolerance of the state/authorities to informal businesses, eg street food. Are informal small business tolerated or encouraged ? Is there any form of corruption involved? How does the state collect taxes ? What is the size of the grey economy? How important is a business registration? 
 
Most restaurants, even small and apparently informal ones, have a PoS management software, and many print a receipt. I often see small business managers using calculators and apparently doing their accounting. Similar restaurants/business in my country usually don't even have a logbook (combination of illiteracy and bad management). I know that Vietnam mostly got rid of illiteracy decades ago, but I feel that there's more to this than just knowing how to read and write.
 
I mostly think of the vietnamese as one of the most industrious people on the planet. But on rare occasions, i meet people that seem even lazier than my countrymen, usually the younger ones. Especially in cafés, waiters seem incredibly slow and unprofessional. What's happening here ? What am I missing?
 
 Sorry if my questions are ingenuous. I just want to better understand the vietnamese society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are expecting a boy soon and have a hard time deciding on a Vietnamese name for him. Our family doesn't live in Vietnam but has roots there, so I really want our child to have a little bit of his culture with him.
 Names we have considered are Minh Anh and Tuan Anh. Tho, I find Minh Anh to be more on the feminine side. 
 I like the two word names with Anh being the second one if possible (a family thing) , but not necessary. Any other suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey friends, I’ve been interested in getting a Vietnamese passport or dual citizenship. What is the difference between the two? Can you get one without the other? I was born in VN and have my birth certificate but did not have a passport as I entered USA under my parents passport (5 years old).
 What do I need to do to get dual citizenship. Keep in mind that I would not be able to obtain any documents pertaining my parents as they do not want me to get dual citizenship. I have family in VN also.

I thought this was somewhat absurd and I stated matter-of-factly that Ho Chi Minh booted France out of Vietnam but he acted like that was a bad thing. His uncle fought with US soldiers and they were exiled to Singapore. He's basically grown up in Vietnam though but he's trying very hard to come to America.

 We've been close friends for nearly five years. They've taught me a lot about antisemitism (they're half jewish) and about Vietnamese culture.
 Recently, we've been getting into some arguments about their behavior and general attitude toward our friendship. I try to be as openminded and a good listening ear but I'm not sure how to pick out what is and isn't "okay" for them to say. (For clarity, I'm autistic and I cannot for the life of me discern some things as excuses and others as real reasons. I err on the side of caution and take everything as a reason but recently I've had a gut feeling about that being the wrong approach.)

My planned route will take me up north from Hanoi, more specifically NW,N&NE. I’m staying away from the “tourist cities”, so I’m aware that a vast majority of interactions will be with locals. Apart from good manners and common sense, is there anything else I should know to stay polite and respectful to the locals? Perhaps a couple phrases in Vietnamese etc etc.

I've tried doing some research on it, but I can't find much about queer couples specifically. (Note, these characters do live in America, however my MC would like to incorporate his mother's traditions into the wedding.)
 For reference, my MC (main character) is Vietnamese and his LI (love interest) is white.

 I will be visiting Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam this upcoming Fall and was wondering if there are any local fashion brands that I should check out? I heard that it is not worth shopping for global brands so I am more interested in shopping locally. 
 The style I am looking for is casual loungewear/active wear, but looking for thick/plush materials that would not pill, fade, and is soft. I typically avoid any loud patterns or colors and enjoy more neutrals. Brands that I think of as an example of the style I am going for is PANGAIA, Gymshark, Alphalete, etc.
 Thank you!

From what I can hear him yell, he broken something of the dog and did something to the dogs teeth, possibly causing it to severely bleed. The dog was wimping and crying very loudly as I can hear my neighbor with his wife and children messing up the dog. I live basically next door with the window right above his house. I need to know if there is any practical way of reporting him for "Animal Abuse". There has to be some way to make him stop as I very much cannot stand the situation.
 Due to obstruction, the videos I have do not contain any images, but the auditory evidence is very clear.
 I live in Phu Quoc, if that affects anything.
 Please give advices, I am only a highschooler and most other members in my family seems like they won't do much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, overseas viet in hcmc on vacation. I'm looking for cheap souvenirs (keychains, fold cards, magnets, totes) for myself and friends. The prices at the central post office seem high so are there any good alternatives? I'm a little wary on ben thanh and am able to venture to other markets like binh tay if they are better. 
 Also, I'm looking to spend NYE in district 1 tomorrow. where would the fireworks be launched or the viewing area? also, any tips for tomorrow (crowds, preparedness)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be visiting soon from Bangkok for a weekend to Hanoi and am looking for any shops that sell local artists works. Not so much the stuff you’ll find in tourist shops but stickers, keychains, postcards and prints that are made by the youth and subcultures of Hanoi. Skater culture and coffee culture shops here usually sell that kind of merch. Even “cute” style designs I don’t mind. Just want to support young artists. I’m staying near the French Quarter and the lake. Thank you in advance.

I can't help but wonder whether this beautiful and romantic trash is ending up polluting the sea or if there are measures in place to remove them beforehand.
 Somebody knows something?

She is currently not doing well having failed two math exams what I would like to know is is she does not pass her math exams throughout the year do they not pass her to the next grade and make her repeat the year over or do they make her do summer school to pass the math grade? Curious as the tutor we got her now seems to be useless in helping her do better. Thanks

 What is your current job and your most recent previous job in Vietnam? What city/district is the job in and how did you land the job? 
 I'm curious for my job search what jobs and positions/roles other expats have and how you got it. Not to mention is it with a local company or international company? I'm looking to see how others went about getting their lives started in Vietnam
 If you have any stories on the timeframe it took for you, how long you've been there and what times you applied that were peak performance hours for applications for jobs I'd love to hear your stories! Thanks friends and stay safe!

In two months time I’ll be travelling to Vietnam, where I plan on purchasing a motorcycle to travel south east Asia on. I’ve narrowed down my search to two models, Honda Wave & Winner. I’ll be landing in Hanoi, where I’ll stay for a couple days sorting out the motorbike and logistics. Although I’m keen on buying one of these two models, I’ll buy whatever’s available to me once I’m there. My question is as follows: are there any well known websites, forums, social media groups, companies etc where travellers and organisations sell their/these motorbikes?

I've been reading online to see the drone laws in Vietnam but its all over the place, what do I really need to know about flying a drone? I saw that drones with cameras aren't allowed but I've seen footage in air of Vietnam? Also, the process of getting a permit seems expensive and complicated for just a day of flying, do I really need it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently an American ESL teacher based in Saigon took to social platforms to expose the truth about the rampant sexual harrasment in a Vietnamese High School (Nguyen Thi Dieu).
 1/Upon seeing a female highschooler being forced to remove her jacket and inappropriately touched by a security guard at school, Teacher Kenny apparently stood up for her by using physical force against the guard. Kenny was furious and was asking for an investigation as this has happened numerous times before with other students. 
 2/There is CCTV footage documenting the guard being inapproprate with students in his office : forcing them to undress to check their nametag, inappropriate touching and groping female students. The school board forced everyone to stay silent and threatened to destroy Kenny's teaching career in Saigon if he went on to draw attention to the case. The guard, on the other hand, only got off with a warning. 
 3/Teacher Kenny has since spoken up about the incident on many social sites such as Tiktok and Facebook, students who are former victims of harrassment by the guard are also speaking up and trying to gain traction for the case.
 4/The Vietnamese English teacher, however, is bribing students with exam points if they stay silent or inform her about the ones who side with Kenny on social media. She called students "stupid" for siding with a "white westerner", threatened various UNDERAGE students for making tiktoks defending the victims and teachers. An adult woman who is an educator is going around spreading racism and threatening minors.
 Here's a link to Kenny's tiktok : https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS86jpE2w/

 I will be flying from California to Việt Nam in January for Tet and plan to bring many electronic gifts (like 5 laptops, 5 iPhones, 5 Apple Watches). I imagine the wise thing to do is just place all of them in a check-in container and pick up at the destination. I was wondering if there would be a problem if i placed a single laptop, watch and iPhone in my carry-on. 
 Thank you in advance for any advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I will be traveling to VietNam early next year. I have a severe seafood (more so finned fish, but contamination is a concern) and brazil nut allergy and I was hoping to get some insight into how I would communicate that in Vietnamese if I need to.
 I looked it up through Google Translate, but I find that it is often not very accurate. If anyone has any advice on pronunciation that would be helpful too, as I find that more difficult as a native English speaker.
 I'm not sure how to phrase it best either, so if anyone has advice regarding that it would be great. I am thinking it would be best to keep it simple, just something like "No seafood/brazil nuts, I die" or "I will die".
 So far something I have thought of trying is to print out an allergy card with the information on it, but I think it may be good to get other suggestions as well. 
 Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I was wondering if anyone has tried the fried chicken at Lotteria in Vietnam and what your thoughts were on it. Personally, I've tried all the big international chains like KFC, Popeyes, and Jollibee, and I have to say that none of them hold a candle to the deliciousness of Lotteria's fried chicken.
 The chicken at Lotteria is always fresh and tender, and the marinade they use is just the right balance of herbs and spices. Plus, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. In comparison, the chicken at the other fast food chains I've tried has been either dry or cold, or both. It's just not the same level of quality as what you'll find at Lotteria.
 Now, I will admit that the rest of the menu at Lotteria leaves something to be desired. The sides are pretty mediocre and the sandwiches and burgers are just okay. And the desserts? Well, let's just say they're not exactly worth writing home about. But despite all that, the chicken at Lotteria is still worth the visit (or delivery) in my opinion.
 So I'm curious to hear what others think - have you tried the fried chicken at Lotteria? What were your thoughts? Is it worth the visit (or delivery)? And if anyone knows of a better fried chicken place in Vietnam, I'd love to hear about it!

 We (my wife and I) are currently in Vietnam, enjoying the country thorougly and planning our next steps. In a few days, we’ll head to the middle of Vietnam, and after that likely to the South. 
 However, it seems the weather won’t be that good for the middle & the south, especially in the region of Da Nang and Nha Trang.
 Also, Phu Quoc seems to get pretty rainy, which was basically our ‘end of holiday’ getaway. 
 Do we need to consider going abroad (say Thailand, Phuket - looking more stable over the course of 2 weeks), or are weather forecasts in Vietnam generally wrong? Would love to hear from you!

 Tôi bị dị ứng nặng. Tôi không thể ăn tôm, cua, tôm hùm, hàu, mực, bạch tuộc và động vật có vỏ. Tôi không thể ăn thức ăn nấu trong dầu như động vật có vỏ. Tôi không thể ăn nước sốt làm từ động vật có vỏ (như dầu hào) hoặc nước mắm với động vật có vỏ

 I am currently a student studying in US. My passport is expired soon and I would like to renew it. Can’t come home just yet. I have a few questions 1. Has anyone applied recently could let me know the exact fee to renew? Can’t find that info on the consulate website?
  
I swear I found an online link to upload my paperwork a few month ago. Does anyone know how can I find the link to apply online instead of mailing because I can’t find it anywhere now.
  
Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am Vietnamese on my moms side and there is a lot of drama between my family in my home country and my family in Vietnam over inheritances and what not. It has reached the point that both sides refuse to talk to each other. 
 However, much to my annoyance, my generation (those born outside of Vietnam) are purposely being kept out of the loop. It doesn't help that I don't speak the language and that my family just blatantly discussess all of this right in front of me, knowing that I can't follow the conversation. The only tidbits of info I get are from eavesdropping on my mother when she is trying to explain the mess to my father.
 When I communicated my chagrin concerning me being kept clueless, my mom explained to me that in Vietnam fights are being kept isolated within the generation and that none of this will affect me, because I am from the next generation.
 Is this a thing in Vietnam or am i being told a bunch of nonsense? Personally, I would prefer to remain on friendly terms with my family in Vietnam.

 A friend and I want to go out of Romania, where we live, on a 3 weeks long trip, and Vietnam will probably be our destination.
 My simple plan is to fly to Hanoi and rent an apartment in the city center. After that, we could split our time between discovering Hanoi at a very relaxed pace and going on daytrips such as these: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293924-Activities-c63-Hanoi.html
 We are open to splitting our times between multiple places in Vietnam, or maybe cutting our time here short and spending a week in Kuala Lumpur or Tokyo, but it seems like a hassle.
 What would you do?

 I have about 1.5 weeks left in Vietnam until I have to go back home. I'm looking for some recommendations on where I should visit this time of the year, or just in general! I'm currently staying with family in HCM, so anywhere drivable is fine but I also don't mind flying somewhere a bit further. So far I have been to: HCM, Sapa, Can Tho, Ha Long, and Ha Noi
 In the past I have also been to Nha Trang and Dalat. 
 I am considering Hoi An. Also would love recommendations for good night markets in the HCM area, or areas with great street food in general! Thanks in advance.

 I will be traveling with my wife and 3 kids (18,16,13) for 2 weeks in March. First time for my wife to come back to Vietnam after she left when she was 6 months old in 1972.
 I am hoping to find a driver for the whole 2 weeks who is willing to travel with us. It would be ideal if they spoke English but that may be a lot to ask? Any thoughts on the best way to find someone?
 Also, because there are 5 of us, AirBnb can sometimes be a good solution. Any reason not to try this route (for example, first 3 nights in Saigon we could get an apartment in District 1). Cost isn't a big issue as I want to make this a memorable trip for everyone. 
 thanks in advance for any and all thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in a smallish town in the South, I am a foreigner and my wife is Vietnamese. I'm pretty embedded in my family and local community and I know that people prefer to handle things "in house" or without the police a lot, but I'm just at a loss.
 The house directly behind ours (their back wall forms the wall of our yard) has a woman who is an absolutely insane and abusive nutcase to her very small child, or maybe children I'm not sure. She screams like a lunatic and hits the poor child, which makes it wail this horrific wail I can't take anymore. It's honestly shameful I haven't done anything yet but I just haven't known what to do and everyone here has a very "mind your own business" attitude so I don't know who to turn to.
 Last week I was afraid that I was listening to her actually killing her child. There was a pained screaming that only comes from death, and then it suddenly cut off to total silence. I remember though that lately I'd heard a puppy, I think she killed the puppy in front of the child. I heard the child sobbing.
 Who do I contact, what branch of government handles investigations like this? Besides the absolutely over the top regular abuse, I feel like if she really did kill that puppy in front of the kid(s) she may one day kill them too. I don't know, I think maybe she has some really intense post-partum psychosis. Due to the layout of the neighborhood I've never actually seen any of them and I don't know what the front of their house looks like.
 I'm very worried and I am at the point that I can't let my moral cowardice get in the way any longer, something needs to be done.
 Can any Vietnamese people here help me? My wife doesn't hear it because she's rarely in the back yard and while she's normally a very lovely person, I don't think she's taking it seriously and may be worried about social blowback.
 Thank you.

 My question is…. Is it possible to get “used” to the heat biologically ? I don’t want tips on how to stay cool… I just want to know if it is possible for my body to get used to the heat if I stay for a certain amount of time. I tend to sweat easily and it seems like stepping outside of my hotel would trigger the sweats. Any advice here? On my trip I just ended up going to Da Lat and other cooler parts of VN.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time visiting Vietnam in March and we will be doing 10 days in the north and trying get some ideas for how we can plan the trip. We want to fit in Ha Giang/Sapa, Ninh Binh, Halong Bay, and Hanoi in but the issue is 10 days is a little tight.
 What do you guys think about the 4 day/3 night option vs 3 day/2 nights for Ha Giang Loop? Is it too rushed to do the 3 day option on QT's website? It allows us to fit Ninh Binh and Halong Bay in a bit easier but I'm a little worried that it'll be too rushed to enjoy the loop.
 The other option is to do Sapa instead of the Ha Giang loop which will definitely make the itinerary easier since I think you can definitely fit Sapa in 3 day/2 nights in very easily.
 Thoughts? Are there any other places you think I should consider and bump one of the options I listed out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This time, an American tourist was caught trying to meet a minor on Christmas Day. Unfortunately, this was also his last day in Vietnam. More than likely nothing will happen to him as he has already gotten on his flight back to America, but the good news is we will be submitting the evidence to his local authorities in New York where he lives. 4 catches in 4 weeks. 
 Be sure to check your children's phones to see who they may be chatting to. I will post the video tonight at 8pm (local time in Vietnam). 
 Just like the other catches, this guy stays and tries to talk his way out of the crime he committed. It is illegal to lure a minor. It is illegal in Vietnam, the United States, and nearly every country around the world.

 My wife and I are currently enjoying a cruise in Ha Long Bay, and contemplating about our journey’s next step in Vietnam. 
 We are definitely into trekking, and the idea is to travel to Sapa, either for a 2 or 3 day trip, to check the beautiful rice fields.
 However, the weather forecast says it will rain unfortunately, and I am not entirely sure if december is a good time to visit, since it may be quite cold.
 Would you guys recommend a visit to Sapa the 27th till the 29th of December?
 Would be great hearing from you. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are staying in Hồ Tràm for holidays, in a big tourist resort. On a Christmas eve Turkey dinner, there was a big group of people, who were (almost)all wearing white fancy clothes: most of them young and adult ladies but some men, children and at least one old lady. They were almost all wearing white fancy clothes: dresses, lacy shirts etc. Except the old woman was wearing something red & some men had jeans or black trousers. They were also playing some games or giving speeches or something.
 In my culture white fancy clothes are usually something a bridal party wears, or on some other special occasion if everyone is wearing them in unison. I was wondering if this is a cultural thing for a special occasion, as they all looked more Asian than Caucasian, and asked our waiter, what was the occasion end gestured in their general direction (I think I did it discreetly) and our waiter was immediately super apologetic and kept repeating "I'm so sorry" and we were super confused, saying "no need to apologize, it's fine" etc. and we never got an answer, what was the occasion, and we were left in confusion.
 My SO was giving me shit afterwards for asking it. I never intended it to be anything hurtful or insulting, as they were in high spirits and I think it is okay in many cultures to ask simply "what's the occasion" when you see a group or family celebrating. 
 So if someone could guess what was the occasion and also tell me if I was an insensitive white biach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may be surprised to know Vietnam has a wonderful cosplay community. There are several groups that organize events year round (usually 1-2 events every month). Currently, there is a Winter Convention Manga Festival going on; it was today and it will also be going on tomorrow too! 
 If you are into anime, manga, comics, and cosplay, then you should absolutely check these events out. I have been going to every event for the last 5 months or so. I film short videos (3-5 minutes) showing the cosplayers. I let them do a pose/action for about 5 seconds and show as many as I can. 
 You can find the cosplay festival videos by searching YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I have a "Cosplay!" playlist from all the events. If you see me there, I am always happy to include you in my videos if you want to be in one. I do it to showcase the cosplay community and let others know about this community in Vietnam. All the people who go are very kind and friendly. Those of us that dress up always allow people to take photos and videos. 
 Entry fees for most of the events is around 120,000 VND. Hope to see more new cosplayers in the near future. If you have any questions, just let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am native and speak the language well. My husband and I have traveled to Vietnam many times together, visited many different regions/cities, we are very comfortable and love it there. Traveling as a young couple in our 20’s was fun and easy. This time we are taking our daughter and I’m suddenly so nervous 😫 Any tips/advice/words of encouragement would be much appreciated!
  
There is no law or regulations on car seat. We were thinking to rent a car and bring our own travel carseat from the US. Has anyone done this? Is transportation going to be a pain?? 
 
Is “high chair” even a thing?? We love street food and always sat on the little plastic stools…our 18mo will for sure just jump off and run lol. How do you handle a toddler when eating out?
 
Can anyone recommend some nice parks or playground in HCMC and Da Lat we can take a toddler to? (Please no Thao Cam Vien or Dam Sen…does that place still exist? Lol no idea) 
 
 Anything else relating to safety, health, food, sleep/Jet lag, that you have experienced please share ❤️ xin cảm ơn 💛

 I am probably describing it badly, but it's basically a long sleeve jacket that goes all the way down to the feet with a hood and possibly even gloves? Head to toe. Like a scooter burka, but waterproof? 
 Any idea where we can buy one? Maybe one of the local chos?

 Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find it anywhere in the US and the only options online have minimum orders of 1000 packages.
 Is there any chance someone would be willing to send maybe 10-20 bags to the US (compensated of course).
 Thank you!

I only feel comfortable to truly express myself in English and sometimes, by reflex, I just think out loud or mumble to myself in English and probably make others think theres something wrong with me.

Since he is still very weak, his family would like to find someone to accompany him and help get him in and out of wheelchairs and through a connecting flight in Tokyo. We will pay for your ONE-WAY ticket ($750 more or less), economy class, from Ho Chi Minh to Chicago. You must be able to enter the US without a visa (i.e., American citizen or greencard holder), since we don't have time to procure a visa. The flight leaves Ho Chi Minh City on Saturday Dec 24 at 11:45pm. 
 If anyone has basic medical or nursing experience, that would be ideal, but we're not expecting it.
 If you're interested, please direct message me and I'll respond with a Zoom link to give you a rundown on his condition and what to expect. I am in San Francisco and there is a 15-hour time difference so I won't be able to check messages until 8 hours from now during my morning time.
 My brother-in-law is a pleasant 50-year old and his illness relates to his internal organs (he's not contagious).

 I am looking for someone to learn the vietnamese language. I have tried it alone, but the pronunciation is as too big of a problem. Even apps did not really help. Is there anyone, or certain pages, on which you can learn reliably Vietnamese? I come from Germany and in my entire environment there is no real way to learn the language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been traveling Vietnam for two weeks and had a wonderful time. The country is beautiful, the food and culture are amazing, and I’ve found the people to be the best part of all - extremely gracious, respectful, and hospitable.
 But then I came to Hanoi. And I’m baffled. We had a bus driver sneezing and coughing up phlegm, spitting it into a cup, for the entirety of a three hour bus ride, there and back, without a mask. This morning, we were in a lovely coffee shop. But the girl sitting across from us, working on her laptop, was sneezing uncontrollably and coughing terribly. She was clearly not just under the weather, but very sick. Again, she was not wearing a mask. I made eye contact with a perplexed look on my face and she looked back as though I was the one in the wrong. 
 And then a cab just now. The driver coughing every 10 seconds for a 20 minute ride. No mask. 
 I know people here wear masks. More than half of the people on motorbikes have them on. What are they for? Do people in Hanoi use them just for pollution? When we were in other cities (Saigon, Hoi An, Ninh Binh, Mai Chau) I saw plenty of people wearing masks inside, and none of the kind of blantant illness that is in Hanoi.
 I’m terribly sorry if this comes off as culturally insensitive. I promise I don’t intend it to be. But coming from the West and other parts of Vietnam, and particularly in a post-Covid world, I’m really perplexed - what is going on in Hanoi?

 Would local people be more offended if I try to speak to them in English, or use my very beginner level Vietnamese? I've heard that if you try to use Vietnamese, people seem very happy that you are making an effort and will be nice to you, but I've also read posts about people who addressed somebody using the wrong pronoun and got scolded in Vietnamese by that person.

 There are many posts like this on this sub, but mostly for people who have 2 vietnamese parents, or who were born in vietnam. these are different cases and do not apply to my case!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My American relative is at Cho Ray Hospital and we're helping to pay his hospital bill. Apparently they don't take credit cards: only cash and wire transfers. Can anyone confirm? I am in the US so I can't provide cash. I asked a friend to extract the wire transfer information from the bill (see attached image) but it seems to be missing some info and I know wire transfers can go bad if you get the slightest detail wrong. There's a QR code, but it wouldn't scan for me. At the very bottom of the bill it mentions "Payoo" which appears to be a payment app. Would anybody be so kind as to look at this bill and decipher for me how to pay it? I have Venmo and PayPal. I know this isn't HIPPA compliant, but that's the least of our worries.

 I recently found out about the other side of my culture and, I have been learning Vietnamese. And, I have been getting the hang of it. The only problem I feel like I'm not doing it right and my English accent comes through. Would I be able to give myself a Vietnamese name so it's easier to say while talking the Vietnamese language or would be offensive? I'm really sorry if it is. I don't really know how to handle things since I wasn't raised in an Asian household I have a lot of mixes in my family but I don't know my Vietnamese family sadly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, 
 We are expat family (kid) from Europe, living in Saigon since half a year. I really see living in Vietnam as a lifetime experience for the whole family but I must admit we are getting tired with Saigon, in particular:
 - air pollution
 - noise
 Things we do like here:
 - green area in D7
 - great English run preschool
 - good eating and services availability 
 As I can work remotely, coming to office not very frequently, moving somewhere else is an option. I need to fly to SEA countries occasionally, trips to China and Japan can happen too. English preschool is important as our kid is just learning English :)
 Danang looks good for those reasons:
 - no air pollution
 - access to beach, proximity to other nature attractions
 - less busy, less traffic
 We have been only once, actually going to Hoi An. I would plan going there for a month or so, closed to end of lease of our apartment in HCMC.
 ​
 To the point. I am curious of opinions/experiences of other people that have done this move, or have been considering it and dropped the idea (why). Anybody here? :)

I'm also interested in groups that have a focus on dance! Thank you so much!!

 From my understanding, traditional Vietnamese clothing is regional. However, I was wondering if there were any outfits specifically for entertainers, especially for singers. Or did they just wear the same thing as everyone else? If someone could help me out or point me in the right direction, that would be fab! Thank you so much!!

 It is a puppy, it needs positive reinforcement and calm correction if it is going to learn. Hitting it when it pees inside or nips at people only scares it and makes it hide bad behavior. They hit it so hard and it makes me so sad.
 I tried to use google translate but all I can find is “how to train your dog” pages, not “this is why you don’t hit dogs” pages. 
 Please help. If there is a better subreddit to post this, please let me know and I will delete this post and put it there instead. Also, I do understand that there is a sensitive history when it comes to dogs in Vietnam, but if you’re going to keep a dog as a pet you should properly treat it as one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I have a question about the exchange rate from USD to VND I have been curious about and hope you all can answer for me. 
 I know the USD rate to VND is about 1.00 USD to 23,000 VND. 
 What does VND start with? for example, when I send money to family in VN. If I send $100 USD and it converts to about 2,300,000. 
 For Vietnamese people does this translate to about 2,300 dollars? 
 That's like here in the US, someone depositing $2,300 into my bank and having enough to buy a older used car. I would think it is equivalent to $230 dollars for you and something that can hold you off for a short amount of time spending-wise, otherwise shouldn't 2,300 lasts a much long time? 
 It seems as though the family in Vietnam spends the money pretty quickly or need to ask for asistance often. So another question would be: Is the cost of living in VN pretty high for locals? I know for us Viet Kieu it's very livable and considered cheap but im hearing a family member said his daughter ate a bowl of Pho for 50,000 and one time 90,000VND. If Vietnam money starts at 1,000 and that is like $1 dollar here in US, that's like me going out to buy a bowl of Pho for $50 - 100 usd which is unheard of. 
 So I've been looking for answers on google about this but have not found a clear answer so I am hoping you all can shed some light on this. 
 thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently in the process of applying for a job in Vietnam. I've been offered a position in Ho Chi Minh City with VUS. I see reviews on glassdoor are generally good, but that's the average of all reviews, and things could clearly have changed post-pandemic, so that's why I'm here asking. I've done teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, and the experience I had with them was very different from how VUS is doing things so far with me. To be honest, it comes off as sketchy at times and makes me suspicious.
 I'll be honest, I'm actually quite confused at points. I was offered a job, but when asked to see an actual written contract with terms, conditions, duties, etc., I was told that I would only see a contract after I've landed in Vietnam. Agreeing to take a job on the other side of the world without having seen and signed an actual contract beforehand strikes me as super sketchy. When I took teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, they provided me with full-on, multi-page contracts to read and review before agreeing to fly halfway around the world.
 I also know that I'll be flown in on a business visa and do a probation period first for a month or two before acquiring a work permit and then a resident permit from there. Once again, this also confuses me. I've never had to do a probation period before when agreeing to do a job overseas, and the whole "applying for a 3-month business visa, then a work permit" thing instead of "applying for a work visa from the get-go" thing also confuses me.
 Lastly, aside from all that, how has your experience been with VUS? How was the teaching and prep workload? How were employer-employee relations overall? Was the pay sufficient to save (aiming for $500 a month if I can) and could hours be picked up easily? If on a part-time contract, was it easy to take vacation days (even if unpaid)? 
 Any and all input is welcome. Thank you very much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I need some travel related advice from a person familiar with these cities in Vietnam : Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue City. 
 I am from India and currently in Vietnam with my parents. I have been here for 6 days and visited Hanoi, Sa Pa, HaLong Bay and HCMC, and now moving on to Hue city by an early morning flight on 21st December, and my return flight back to India is in evening of 24th December from Da Nang. 
 The issue, now, is that the weather forecast shows it will more or less rain for next 3 days (21-24 December) continuously. I was currently planning to visit the Historic city of Hoi An, then Ba Na Hills through Ropeway and then Citadel in Hue city and then go back to Da Nang and take the return flight. 
 Can someone please help me figure out how many days I should spend in each city and what I should avoid doing to make the best of whatever time I have in these 3 cities. Or. Maybe I can go to a nearby city that has no rain and travel there? Open to suggestions.

 My husband and I arrived at HCMC airport a couple hours ago - we’ve been in Thailand for the past couple weeks on holiday, and thought we’d pop over to Vietnam for a few days too. 
 When we came out the airport, one of the guys in a white shirt got us. All the advice we read beforehand was about metered taxis, and the guy said that the taxi is metered so we didn’t think anything more of it so it should be fine. Hopped in and asked to be dropped to our hotel in District 1. 
 No joke… the meter was going up 25k every 10 seconds. After less than 10 mins of driving, we told him it’s far too expensive and we need to get out. Paid 600k to be left on the side of the road :( wish we’d stuck to our guns and given him less, he made a stupid amount off our naïveté. 
 We ordered a Grab which dropped us the rest of the way for just 80k. In hindsight that’s what we should’ve done when we were looking for a taxi, but hindsight is always 20/20!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I’m considering moving to Vietnam (just made a post), and I would truly love to have some opportunity to be involved in something such as medical research in Vietnam. I have a bachelors degree in Biomedical science, and am more than willing to learn Vietnamese if needed. Are there any such opportunities like this for a British person there? I have tried looking into it a bit but can’t seem to find much information or opportunities, but maybe you guys here would know much more, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all been on this forum for a while. I am strongly considering moving to Vietnam. I’d love to have a scientific job there such as medical research, but I’ve done quite a bit of looking into this and can’t seem to find many opportunities, so I would probably go into teaching english.
 I lived in Saigon for about 6 months in 2020 with my now ex-gf, and I really loved it, and ever since have been a little obsessed with watching videos about it, keeping up with news/info there. My friends and family know I love it as I do speak about it with them sometimes.
 The problem is, while I was living there, I wasn’t actually working, so it was more of an extended holiday, and I know actually working there would be much different. I have a TEFL certificate and also a bachelors degree, and actually had an interview a while ago when I was considering moving there a year ago, and was offered a teaching job, but in the end I declined it.
 Only things that are stopping me are leaving my great friends and family here, learning to ride a bike there is a bit daunting (never driven one before), and maybe regretting my decision after taking the leap. 
 I am considering taking another holiday there for around a month and just kind of acting like I l live and work there, just to test it out, but not sure how useful that actually is.
 Anyway, if you have any thoughts on this let me know! And if you know of any medical science jobs there that a British person with a science degree could get into, please tell me (although I may make a separate post about this)!

Phiên bản City Edition sẽ chỉ có quãng đường đi được là 300 km khi sử dụng điện và xét rằng Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited dẫn động cầu sau (đầy đủ tải) có giá tương đương với VF 8 City Edition (khoảng 1,3 tỷ đồng) trong khi cung cấp quãng đường chạy điện là 485 km , điều đó có nghĩa là Vinfast VF 8 có thể sẽ khó bán ở Mỹ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm planning a two week motorbike road trip in Vietnam and I'm trying to decide where to go. I'm considering either starting in Ho Chi Minh City and making my way up to Hanoi, or just focusing on the northern part of the country. I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations on which option would be the best for a road trip.
 I'm interested in seeing as much of the country as possible, but I'm also open to just staying in one region if it has particularly beautiful or interesting sights to see. I'm particularly interested in seeing more of the traditional Vietnamese culture and nature. 
 Is the southern part of Vietnam also worth visiting, or is Ho Chi Minh City the main highlight in that region?
 Any thoughts or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!
