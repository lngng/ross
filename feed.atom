        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My husband and I are heading to Vietnam and are planning to stay for at least 3 months. We've been in Thailand for over a year and I was wondering about the cultural norms in Vietnam. In Thailand things like, "saving face," being non-confrontational, feet low/head high, etc. are cultural norms/part of daily life. What are some Vietnamese cultural norms/do's & dont's that we should know of? Thanks!

 I know dating apps are popular these days, but I'm honestly not the best when it comes to texting and connecting with people I don't know well. I prefer more personal interactions where I can get to know someone face-to-face.
 So, my question is, what are some effective ways for me to meet and connect with people in HCM city? Are there any local events, clubs, or communities that you would recommend joining? Maybe you know of specific places where people tend to gather and socialize? All suggestion or personal experience is welcome.
 p/s: I speak both english and vietnamese fluently.

 I'm sorry if you do this haha, but it's so annoying to witness/be around when this is happening! For example: My aunt called my other aunt (whose house we were driving to which is less than 15 mins away) and put her on speakerphone and all I heard was my other aunt tussling dishes and food prepping for a house party. My dad and aunt do this too and my cousin told me her old bosses at the nail shop she used to work at do that too! If I'm around someone doing it I don't even like to talk cause it feels like the other person silent on the other end of the phonecall is eavesdropping or that I'm intruding even though they're sitting in silence lol. My cousin and I were talking about it but we didn't have a good reason as to why. 
 What is the reason?!

 I should start by saying that I am only assuming this man is Vietnamese, because I googled his name, Tran, and Google says it's a Vietnamese name. 
 I work at a gym, and this man comes in to work out and use our massage chairs. Any time he needs to communicate something to me he uses Google translate, and he does know a few phrases like "thank you" and "good night," but today he brings his phone up to me and shows me his question, which is that he would like help learning English. 
 He asked for my phone number and I didn't want to be rude, so I gave it to him, but he texted me saying he needs someone to help him learn English. 
 I'm not really a teacher, and I definitely don't speak Vietnamese. I want to provide some sort of help, because he's always so nice and patient when I'm helping with whatever he needs around the gym, but I'm at a loss for what to say. 
 I was hoping maybe reddit would be a good place to find people who understand Vietnamese culture, and might know what sort of help he is looking for specifically?
 (I have texted him asking if he is Vietnamese just to be sure. I really hope that doesn't come off as rude. Just trying my best guys. Waiting on that response)
 (I flaired this as discussion but realistically a flair like "language" might be more apt. I picked what seemed to make the most sense out of the options, sorry if I didn't use it right)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnamese born American here. I am currently solo traveling Vietnam from north to south. My family is from Saigon. When I travel or live with my family, I only get their point of view and bias opinions.
 Since I have been traveling the north solo, I have interacted with locals. It is hard to understand non-Saigon accent sometimes but I can understand enough to hold a conversation. I will tell them that Hanoi accent is hard to understand and that I learned Vietnamese from my family who is from Saigon. One person said that Hanoi Vietnamese is the proper way. Even the American War museum was so much different from American history. It shows how little I know about my roots.
 Please recommend your 3 top must read books. It can be about the war, history in general, culture, or anything.
 The books have to be in English because I cannot read Vietnamese lol.

 They say:
  
This shipment contains cosmetics. As articles 35 circular 06/2011/TT-BYT, consignee can only imports cosmetics with total customs value under 1,000,000VND. If it’s over 1,000,000VND, you must provide the import permit from Ministry of Health.
  
Can that really be right..?! You need a permit from the ministry of health? I found the referenced legislation here but I see no mention anywhere of a 1,000,000 limit on imports 🤷

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! My name is Victor, from Saigon Dragon Studios. For a bit more than 2 years now we’ve worked on the RTS game Space Tales, and today we’re making its Steam page public :)
 https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457960/Space_Tales/?beta=0
 Quick background about us: we’ve launched SDS in 2015, as an outsourcing studio specializing in video game 2D and 3D arts. Vietnam (and HCMC) are well known in the video game industry as several top outsourcing companies are located there. A ton of Vietnamese talents have worked on famous games/movies. Surprisingly however, there aren’t many studios in Vietnam who develop and publish their own games (– whenever I am in a game convention for example I always hear ‘ah yes Vietnam, it’s where Flappy Bird was made”, which really annoys me because it’s not representative of the talents Vietnam has.)
 A couple of years ago we decided to start working on our own game in parallel of our outsourcing services, and we wanted to do as much as possible in Vietnam (only music and sounds are being made elsewhere). We still have a lot of work to do on our game, but we would love to hear your feedback on what we have to show for now.
 The teaser for our game can also be watched on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elHEmpUTcEk 
 Looking forward to receiving your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m 22 and was born in the US, my parents both immigrated from vietnam. I visited when I was 4 but don’t remember much except the blistering heat. My mom basically forced me to come with her this past June, and I was dreading it bc the time difference, the heat, and the fact that it’s more of a developing country and I’m so spoiled in the Us. Well that was so naive of me because I definitely had an unforgettable experience and vietnam blew me away. 
 We backpacked a bit through vietnam, we went to Saigon, Canh Tho, Cu Chi, Sapa, Hanoi, halong bay, phu quoc, Mekong, tay ninh. At first when I landed I couldn’t wait to get back home. But throughout the trip , the sights were in believable, the food amazing, the motorbikes were so fun, and just cruising through the streets people watching of the cities was so enjoyable. There was just so much to see culture wise as well and opened my eyes to a different lens of the world. and now that I’m back home I feel a small heartache which I wasn’t expecting. It’s been 2 days and I’m still thinking abt this trip
 Although some people were rude and inconsiderate, most were so kind, they treated me and my sister like celebrities. (I thought we looked viet but guess not lol) ppl were constantly approaching us saying we were beautiful. Also i noticed that everyone talks to each other like they already know each other, which is so different than in america. I loved vietnam and want to go back again. This trip holds a special place in my heart and I think will trigger me to start travelling internationally more because that was transformative

 Should I be worried it's taken this long, is there something specific to Contact? I double checked just to see if the package got transferred to another carrier (VN post and EMS), but neither showed up anything.

 I recently met, then started dating a wonderful girl from Vietnam. Her birthday is quite soon, i have my ideas on what to buy her, but I was wondering if theres any particular gift that a Vietnamese girl, or Vietnamese people might appreciate for their birthday. 
 It's been a month or so, but we really, really appreciate each other a lot already, so something cheesy is ok too. That can include cooking. Already tried egg coffee and lemongrass chicken so far. She's in her mid 20s if that helps, and we both live in Europe.
 Also, I wanted to give appreciation to you guys in general, I didn't know much about Vietnam, but you guys are so nice and welcoming It's scary, your country's history is pretty humbling too. I can't wait to be lucky enough to visit Hanoi one day !
 Thanks, in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm planning a trip in December. I spent six weeks in Central Vietnam about 10 years ago and I loved it! Unfortunately I've been struggling with health problems for the last couple of years, and so this trip is very much going to be a relax by the pool type of affair.
 I was considering Hoi An or potentially Sapa for a 10 day stay? The touristy nature of Hoi An is a bit confronting whereas the Northern mountain ranges are attractive as hell to me. Can anyone lend their opinion/give any recommendations for a resort-style stay that isn't going to be busy to the point of stressful?
 Proposed Itinerary
 December 1st - 4th Fly into Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay for a few nights to recover from flight
 December 4th - 14th Bus/train/plane to destination and stay for 10 days
 December 14th - 17th Bus/train/plane back to Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay a few days before departure
 Additional Info
  
I should be able to manage around 5,000 steps each day
 Budget is around $4,000 AUD for two people for 17 days (not including flights)
 I'm used to travelling for the adventure so this style of travel will be very new to me. Anything luxurious + off the beaten path is very appealing!
  
Would appreciate any help! Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Vietnamese passport and want to buy a house in Vietnam. However, I've heard I need the new ID to do the paperwork. I don't have the new ID and the problem is I can't take off work too long to go to Vietnam and wait for the new ID to process. Is there anyway to speed up the process? I've heard you can't bribe to speed up the new ID since it's all electronic and centralized now.

VN was my first language, so i’m not worried about understanding the language but i probably have a bit of an accent and am not sure how i would blend in or if people would even recognize me as one (i’m kinda pale so people sometimes think im chinese lol). but i’m curious to know what it’s like for others in the same situation. if you were born somewhere else and then came to vietnam how was the experience? were you treated more as a vietnamese or as a foreigner?

Which one stands out amongst the pack and why?

The skin was not pierced in any way and there was no wound apart from small red marks where the teeth were. From reading online apparently rabies can only be transmitted through penetration of the skin.
 I’m just feeling a bit concerned, I’m in Hanoi and don’t speak any Vietnamese apart from a few basic words and not sure where I could go to explain my issue
 Hope this post is appropriate for the sub, just didn’t know where else to ask
 Thank you
 EDIT - thanks so much to everyone for the advice, I’m heading to an international hospital and have my documents ready. Really appreciate everyone’s support on this post it means a lot 🙏
 EDIT 2 - Just got my first jab and now have a schedule for the next 4! Feeling much more at ease now

 Tôi là nam 18 tuổi và đã đến Catfe trong chuyến đi đến Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh ở Việt Nam (ngày 19 tháng 6). Khi tôi ở đó, tôi đã thử vuốt ve một con mèo mới được giới thiệu với Catfe. Trước khi có thể vuốt ve con mèo, một cô gái tình cờ cảnh báo tôi rằng con mèo mới đến và nó cắn. Dù sao tôi cũng quyết định vuốt ve nó và cuối cùng bị trầy xước, nhưng điều mà tôi vẫn nghĩ sau đó là giọng nói của cô gái đó nghe thật hấp dẫn làm sao. Tôi không nghĩ đến việc bắt chuyện vì tôi muốn nhìn thấy nhiều mèo hơn, nhưng càng nghĩ về tình huống đó, tôi càng nghĩ về cách tôi nên tiếp cận cô gái mặc quần yếm màu hồng đó. Cô ấy không chỉ có giọng hát hay mà còn rất xinh đẹp và thậm chí trang phục của cô ấy cũng rất tuyệt. Nếu điều này đến được với cô ấy, tôi sẽ coi đó là một phép màu. 
 ​
 I am an 18 year old male and went to a Catfe during my trip to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam (June 19). While I was there I tried petting a new cat that was introduced to the Catfe. Before being able to pet the cat, a girl just so happened to warn me that cat was new and that it bites. I decided to pet it anyway and ended up getting scratched, but what I kept thinking about afterwards was how attractive that girls voice sounded. I didn't think about starting a conversation because I wanted to see more cats, but the more I think about that situation, the more I think about how I should have approached that girl in pink overalls. Not only was her voice pretty, but she was beautiful too and even her outfit was awesome. If this ever reaches her I would consider it a miracle.

 Catfe address: CATFE, 119 Đ. Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai, Phường Bến Thành, Quận 1, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh 700000, Vietnam

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm building an app to learn foreign languages by reading books, called FLReader, and I'm looking for people who could help me improve it by using it and giving me feedback.
 It's pretty easy to use, I think. You either upload an epub or download one from our server. Then you just click on the words and it will translate the word and the phrase.
 You can download it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jorgeperezgomez.flreader2
 Future versions will store the words for future review, provide basic lessons on grammar so the user can read the book, and so on. But I wanted to share the app first and find early adopters who could give me some feedback about how it can be improved.
 We also have a reddit sub where people will be able to tell us what they think, ask for new features and so on: https://www.reddit.com/r/FLReader/

 I'm travelling to Vietnam this summer and I need to get from Ninh Binh to Halong Bay and then from Halong Bay to Hanoi.
 We read online that it is the best option to book buses and 12go.asia was often recommended. Just wanted to check if anyone has experience with this site and can suggest one of the many travel companies.

 i am planning to visit vietnam with my friends (and be kind of guide as i have vietnamese roots) but due to my personal reasons, we might have to postpone the trip for october/november
 we didnt buy tickets or anything but my friends dont like the idea of postponing things if not necessary (which i understand), but i might be a bit too financialy unstable and work stressed in march/april, thats why i suggested possible postponing for october/november
 the thing is that i want to provide them with great experience and memories but also personally, it would be better for me in october/november and i am considering to be a bit selfish for a change and do it in october/november, however i do not want them to go there and experience unpleasant weather the whole time (understandably, it will be raining in some places)
 can i still sell them the idea of great trip even though it would be in october/november instead of march/april (kind of knowing that march/april are ideal months for visit)
 thanks for your opinions:)

 I've tried searching on Google for tours/vans etc, but they're all $100+. Same with Airbnb Experiences. Seems like a rip-off. I don't need hand-holding through the temple, just the transportation up and back.
 All of the tourist-oriented shops around the city look like total scams, so I haven't bothered with these either.
 Also considered using Grab but it's not really designed for long distances... I'm worried I'd get stranded out there.
 Anything I'm missing? Or do I really need to rent my own vehicle to take this trip?

 I didn't realize my phone was stolen at that time, but I realized it was gone at that time she touched me. It happened on Thursday and today, I find out that thief logged in to my Apple account and deleted what I registered as stolen phone.

The theory test which is all in Vietnamese of course involved me studying and memorizing answers for 6 months. As a result I was able to easily pass it along with the theory test. Despite being an inexperienced driver I thought that tge practical test would be a piece of cake. But I've just failed my 4th test in 4 months. I feel hopeless and useless. My wife passed it after the first try and really can't understand why I can't pass it. To make things worse my Vietnamese in laws and all their friends and relatives are making feel awful about not passing the test.
 I am starting to feel hopeless and depressed and I feel really pressured by everyone around me to pass. I do a practice run the day before I take the test everytime and I am usually able to pass with 100 points but when it comes to the test I always end up messing something up. Today I even failed within the first two minutes. The other times I was actually pretty close to passing but messed up. I have gone around the course on my own many times and have no issue passing. I don't know whats wrong with me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be moving to Hanoi at the end of August and I'm wondering about the dating scene there.
 Ideally, I'm looking to build something serious but not necessarily with a local. I'm rather Western European in my expectations and ways. . . 
 My questions are roughly. . .
  
if you found your significant other in Vietnam, how/where was that?
 
how is the dating process? (I've heard it's extremely slow) Are the kind of locals willing to move faster and/or hook-up, the same kind that you'd want to date or not at all?
 
from dating apps: first dates as coffee dates or wine/cocktail dates? Or something else? (I never invite ppl over directly from apps - I need to feel a personal connection first and also for safety reasons)
 
is going to a bar/club alone a thing? Or only some clubs/bars are good for this?
 
ultimately, where do you meet people and socialize? I tend to do a lot of "expat event" kind of things but, depending on the country, the ppl that show up are not necessarily the nicest.
 
would it be very limiting to try and date only other expats?
 
finally, what pitfalls you'd warn another foreigner about?
 
 No need to answer each and every. I just want to get an overall impression of what to expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello~
 So I've heard that pho is can be prepared very differently depending on what area of Vietnam you are in, so I had the idea of doing a whole-country pho tour later this year. Start at the top/bottom and make my way to the other side while trying pho (and other food of course) in different cities.
 So I have a few questions, especially for people who have more experience with Vietnam and trying food in different areas of the country!
  
Do you think this is a fine idea, or a waste of time? Is pho really that different depending on what part of Vietnam you are in, or is it mostly the same?
 Which areas (or specific restaurants) would you recommend I try for a complete experience?
 Are there any other regional foods that you recommend I try on this journey?
  
I will be trying to document as much of this as possible, so I will definitely come back with my thoughts and feedback on how different they actually were, my favorites, etc!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't had the opportunity to visit Vietnam since I was 6 years old. About 5 years ago my parents divorced and my dad figured it was time to go back to Nha Trang. Last week I received news that he had fallen incredibly ill so I booked a last minute trip to Vietnam to visit him for about 3 weeks. Although this isn't exactly a vacation as I plan on helping to care for my dad, I'm sure there will still be plenty of opportunities to go exploring and get back in touch with my Vietnamese heritage.
 Given that I haven't gone by since I was 6 and that I'm from California, I really have no idea how to prepare. What should I bring? What should I be cautious about? What are some dos and don'ts? I'm a pretty open-minded eater and literally wish to try all the things. Any recommendations?
 Other things about me:
 My Vietnamese is decent, I understand the southern accent very well and can get by in terms of speaking, but things get a little rough if the other person has a northern accent. If the other person has a central accent, no way lol. Unfortunately I can't read Vietnamese either.
 I'm terrible at dealing with the heat but can manage if I have to.
 I'm not taking days off work and plan to work (I'm a software engineer director) as well. How's the coffee shop scene over in Nha Trang?
 Any recommendations on what I must do over there on this last minute unplanned trip would also be appreciated!

 I was offered a job in market research for a big international corporation that has an office in HCM.
 I'm from Romania and I saw on Numbeo the comparison between my city (Bucharest) & HCM, but an advice from people living there would be very helpful. 
 I would want to rent a 1 room apartment/studio in district 1, 5 or 10, which are close to my job. I don' want a luxurios life style but I would probably eat out often, go in bars, experience the local culture, travel and overall want to live a confortable life. Not be very aware of every dollar spent.
 Is it enough 1000$ to do all that (pay rent, travel in vietnam, eat out, drink, local transport, groceries, etc,)?

 Here’s the thing - I’m doing job interviews at the moment trying to get a job, but have limited money at the moment. I did a trial lesson at a centre, and after the lesson they asked if I wanted to pay for my tuition fees then and there. The fees were 19.6 for 80 hours (I believe?) but I told them I don’t have the money for it currently due to finding work and not employed. I really want to start learning as soon as possible, but really struggle with apps such as Duolingo and resources like YouTube. I can’t learn anything from there - I get super distracted because of my ADHD and prefer in-class.
 Do you have any suggestions, or should I just wait until I start getting a salary and have more money? It’s making me a little sad that I only speak English and want to learn the language because I feel like I’m experience 1/50th of the life here…

 My wife is currently holds a U.S. green card but she is a Vietnamese citizen. She went to Vietnam in the beginning of May to visit her family after graduating and starting her job in August. She figured while she was there she would renew her passport (Expired in June of 2023). Unknown to us that there’s a shortage issue with the newer ID there and she can only renew her passport using that newer ID. It’s been a month and a half, there’s no sign of her getting the ID. Is there something she can do so that she can return back to the U.S. more urgently? Or rather what’s the average wait time for the ID to get processed, printed, and shipped? For future planning. 
 Thank you in advance.

I will be living with a host family in Hanoi for the next year and I was wondering what is an appropriate gift to bring them according to the customs of the culture. It is a middle aged couple, husband and wife, no young children. Any recommendations are appreciated. Thank you! 
 Xin chào! Tôi sẽ sống với một gia đình chủ nhà ở Hà Nội trong năm tới và tôi đã tự hỏi đâu là một món quà thích hợp để mang chúng theo phong tục của văn hóa. Đó là một cặp vợ chồng trung niên, chồng và vợ, không có con nhỏ. Bất kỳ khuyến nghị được đánh giá cao. Cảm ơn bạn!

 I'm used to colder temperatures (19 Celsius) so hanoi was a big contrast. I like to go about early mornings and it's a lovely city. I was told "oh you'll get used to it". I noticed some of yall seem cool as a cucumber out in the unshaded areas, not a drop of sweat. Then I see others with fans out. Then I see others bolting into air conditioned buildings just drenched. How are y'all handling this heat? I've been handling it by just putting my hair up, going out and about earlier in the mornings, hydrating, fan and something to wipe my sweat up from my vitiligo'd face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/vietnam. I will be visiting HCM next week and I'm planning to buy a Samsung phone because it's cheaper there than here in the Philippines where I live. I was initially planning to order it online and have it delivered to Bitexco Tower or any nearby branch but I can't proceed with the website order page. From step 2 shipment details, it doesnt proceed to step 3 select payment. So I might just check and buy it in the actual Samsung Store. Is it true that you cannot buy in the Bitexco branch? The other nearest to my hotel is the 134 Nguyen Thai Hoc St. branch. Anyway, can anyone check the latest price of Samsung S23+ in HCM? I just wanted to check if it's the same as the one in store. Also, if this is the wrong sub to post this inquiry, please help me identify the correct one.
 Since I'm already here, any tips on my upcoming trip? Previously went to Hanoi already. Can anyone perhaps help me identify the correct sequence of how I should plan my route/itinerary to visit the most famous spots in the city? Thanks in advance!

 And my partner seemed to be quite confused. They were just kind of like, “Yes, he knows how to use chopsticks?? And you just chew and swallow??”
 There seems to be some confusion since I directly translated, “Biết ăn không?” into English as opposed to saying something like “Oh would this fit his palette?”
 So my question is- how would you go about translating/explaining “biết ăn không?” to someone who doesn’t speak Vietnamese?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 I was wondering if someone could give me some advice on how to get from Siem Reap to Ho Chi Min City? Or what stops would be necessary along the way (like border crossing) to make it without breaking the bank? Options for busses seem pretty limited and but doable price wise, any suggestions would be appreciated!

 But since I've visited all of the main sights like Palace of reunification, war remnants museum, Landmark 81 and a few temples in D5, I'm getting quite bored and I want to find other things to do here.
 I plan on going to other parts of the country but at the moment I only work in the evening during the week so it makes it harder to find time when looking at traveling around Vietnam.
 What can anyone recommend to do here? Any hidden gems?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I assumed they were pro-France because 1. the South Vietnamese government was backed by France 2. I think a third of France's army in the Indochina War were Vietnamese who relocated to the South. 3. they have a Catholic majority.
 But from talking to South Vietnamese supporters it sounds like they also hate France too. Yet the French flag was raised throughout South Vietnam. Did the South Vietnamese want to expel ALL foreign occupiers or did they want joint cooperation? Was the North more nationalistic than the South?
 To me the North sounds a lot more like the American founding fathers and the South were more interested in neocolonialism.

 Going to have a 13hr25min layover at Ho Chi Minh airport. 
 However, it's an overnight layover between 9:25pm to 10:50am the next day and I can't get a day tour or visiting tourist attractions because of that. 
 So, what's your suggestion? Maybe I can go to some night street market before 12 then head to some bar/clubs or hotel? What are the places that I can go at late night to look around? 
 Thanks a lot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live a great life in the U.S. but as I am sitting at work, I still think about moving back to Vietnam or how to do so in the future. This obsession has been going on for years now.
 I'm aware of all the pros and cons, it's just that I have this strange yearning to be there. My mom passed away last year and her family is still in Vietnam. We are very close and I want to live near her family before they all pass away as well. They are one connection I have left with her.
 The main issue is that I won't be able to get more than 3-4 weeks vacation off each year from work, and tickets will cost around 8k now. The flight is so long too just for a trip where we'll be spending at least one week with jetlag and stomach issues. Plus, my wife wants to go on vacations/beaches while I just want to near Quan 7 with the relatives.
 I've thought about moving to Orange County or Houston to ease this feeling, but those Vietnamese cities just don't feel the same. 
 I know the future is far brighter in 15 years for the family if I stay in the U.S., I just feel sad each day working. I spend hours thinking about having enough money to live in Vietnam without worrying about the future.
 It's not rose-tinted glasses either, I worked remotely and had lived in Vietnam for 6 months recently with my wife/child. It was great. I know education and healthcare might be a problem later on. Waking up early for coffee and breakfast while watching the crazy traffic, going out to eat seafood/hot pot at night - that just can't be beaten.
 I suppose I'm just ranting and being too greedy. I can always get a significant pay cut/career limitation and get a remote job to live in Vietnam. It's just that I want what's best for my family/kid's future as well.
 Does anyone(especially the Viet Kieus) feel the same way?

Is the Champa civilization also taught in schools as a part of vietnamese culture?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A parent named Le Mau Duyen has been fined 6.5 million VND for physically assaulting his child's teacher. The assault was alleged because the child received the teacher's "average conduct" rating.
 This assessment was given to the student due to an incident where the student insulted the teacher after arriving late to class. The parent, persistently blaming the teacher for hindering their child's enrollment in police schools, where “good level” conduct is required, finally resorted to physically attacking the teacher.
 In Vietnam, students are evaluated based on their academic performance and conduct, using a system with four levels: Good, Fair, Average, and Weak.
 What do you think about it?

 Also which hospitals are trustworthy? A few people recommended Benh viet mat Sai Gon which seems to be owned by the government and has done a lot of surgeries. 
 I was also wondering whether I should go for the lasik option (cost like 20m VND) or Relex smile (50m vnd). Relex smile supposed to have faster recovery time and fewer complication risks but require a skilled surgeon, which again I'm not so sure

Now that we’ve been home in the states for 2 weeks she just got a call from a number her caller ID says was the Vietnamese Embassy. They claimed that someone was using her name/info in Vietnam to scam people and that she needed to work with the police in Vietnam to clear her name. They transferred her to a police station in Vietnam and the police officer used Viber to video talk with my wife in full uniform. She declined when he started asking for passport information. He said if she does not trust it she can investigate herself or find another way to have it investigated. Has anyone got a call like this before? The phone numbers check out online but this just screams scam to me. Just looking for advice and how to move forward with this?

 Saw this Veggie and Cheese Burger at the Burger King. I'm wondering if this suitable for vegetarians? No animal fat or meat. I'm okay with eggs. Should I just get the fries instead? Hope someone can comment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have lived in Ha Noi for 5 years and I have visited Saigon many times but I have always been interested in why Saigon doesn't seem to have an architetural equivalent to the Hoan Kiem and Ba Dinh in Ha Noi(even parts of Ha Dong old town in fact)
 The thing that gets me is that Saigon always had more french influence then Ha Noi. It was directly governed by Paris as opposed to the rest of Vietnam which was under harsher colonial rule. It was the center of french colonial life in Indochina with the French having their tennis clubs and Rugby teams.
 Yet I haven't seen as many old french mansions(of course there are lots of old government buildings but less so then Ha Noi)

Everything from the food to the people are top notch. I don't know whether it's because I come from a country where women who drink and smoke and walk the streets late at night are perennially unsafe, but being here is simply so liberating. I haven't travelled the world much, but I've been to the Middle East, Singapore, and Germany, and none of them compare. Being here is a cultural shock in a good way.
 I know this post is vague, but I just wanted to say thank you so much wherever I could and to whomever I could, hence me doing so here. Vietnamese people are the warmest, most down to earth people I've come across 🙏🏽 I hope to keep visiting and learn the language someday.

 Right now I use a workaround at translate.google.com using their English symnonyms feature and then look for Vietnamese words for those words but it's quite timeconsuming and sometimes it just doesn't work (no symnonym for either English or Vietnamese listed).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in Vietnam. I went back home and when I came back to Vietnam I brought some souvenirs and gifts. Nothing special. I was brought up "minimalist". I never bought fancy gifts for my partners, friends, and family. So, why would I do that to people who are, well, at the periphery of my friendzone?
 And all in all: Isn't it the thought that counts?
 Anyhow, my gifts received some harsh comments. For instance, a Vietnamese friend got some brand clothes from Europe. I bought some toys for his younger brother. Do you know Playmobil? A bit like Lego. I confess, the two toys (a Wild-west Fort and a Pirate ship) were on discount. But they cost about 100$. That is more than I gave to my bf for Christmas, LOL. Anyhow, I can survive that a 10yo doesn't say thankyou and is happy. But my friend said, that his brother was disappointed because he wanted some more "valuable".
 I am not on a paylevel which enables me to throw around with MacBooks and Iphones. I do not have such devices neither.
 Another time I was invited and I bought a 25$ red wine bottle. In my home country Germany that would already be too much. Most guests will spend about 10-15$. No one really awaits a 1,000$-bottle of Rothschild stuff.
 Anyhow, the host was quite rude. During the evening he showed my bottle, made a gesture like vomitting and put it aside. Then he presented a fancy Whiskey bottle and told everyone that the bottle was about 200$. This person was not even close to me, so why would I pay 200$ for some alcohol? I am in general a generous guy, but these two examples (there are quite more in my experience) are really too much. I understand, I am the "rich" foreigner. But they cannot really await that I come of dozens of Iphones, cars, laptops? I feel really sad, since my personal life is not circling around consumption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To give a bit of context, I'm (21M) a viet kieu and haven't been back to vietnam for about 6 years. typically, I would go back with my parents, where they would handle all the talking and navigating. This time, I am planning on exploring by myself without a guide. My worry is that I am very awkward talking to people who aren't my parents, and I constantly feel like my vietnamese is at a 6 year old's level. Is there any conversation etiquette that I should be of prior to going? 
 I'll be staying at the Thanh Tai hotel (closest to airport) next week. Are there any recommendations on where I should go, any tips for walking about etc? I'll be in HCM for a week. Thanks

Does it make sense to travel this way - Hanoi to Nimh Binh, Nimh Binh to Halong Bay, then back to Hanoi for a night before heading to Sapa. From Sapa back to Hanoi again to fly out of Vietnam.
 Would the water be too cold to go into the beach in late December? 
  
Many thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a native, I struggle to find something truly captivating within our local art scene. Mainstream stuff is extremely low-brow, while art-house offerings often appear nonsensical and lacking substance. Many galleries and events rely almost exclusively on foreign funds like the Goethe Institute. I'm curious about the differences between our art scene and those of other developing countries. Is there a way to bridge this gap and create artistically profound and entertaining art, similar to what filmmakers like Bong Joon Ho and Park Chan Wook have achieved in Korea?

I’m perfectly fine with a Vietnamese name on the Vietnamese citizenship due to the naming laws. Cheers

Suddenly, my father kept asking me which job and career should I choose after done high school and at that point, I don’t know anything about that nor thinking about that. I don’t have any talents and does not have any career or job. Then he is asking about the future. Asking above the sky and things that I don’t even know. What should I do in this situation? Should I argue with my parents or doing something else?

 I find it very disruptive. I wonder why people buy tickets when they don't even want to watch the movie in the first place. The theater also didn't have loud sounds so we could hear everyone in the room talking loud about something else except the movie.
 Is it common for vietnamese people to talk too loud during movies in cinema?

A friend and I are going to be in Hanoi for 10 days in July, and we were planning on spending 5 days in Hanoi, a day trip to Ninh Binh and the last 3 nights in Ha Long Bay, but we've been seeing threads on how Ha Long is deserted and there's no point in staying the night there.
 Can someone please provide some clarity on whether this is true and too much time in Ha Long? Taking an overnight cruise is a little outside our budget so we're not keen on that, especially given that one of us is prone to seasickness. Would it be better to spend a couple of days elsewhere in the north? If yes, where should we be going?

Nguyên nhân khiến mình áp lực và thất vọng có lẽ là vì mình đã làm "vua chột trong xứ mù quá lâu" và được bạn bè, thầy cô, cha mẹ cho là giỏi suốt những năm đi học mãi tới sau này mình mới nhận ra điều này, Mình mới dùng reddit vì cũng chả biết chia sẻ với ai nữa. Em biết điểm số bây giờ không còn quan trọng nữa nhưng em vẫn thấy khó chịu ấy ạ, kiểu trước giờ luôn nghĩ mình có một cái gì đặc biệt nhưng thực ra lại rất bình thường và khi nhận ra điều đó làm em khó chấp nhận ấy ạ.

 Guy came up to me on the street with his scooter and started talking to me, picking me as Australian. Told me he has family in Australia and telling me all about them. Asked if I'd like to get a drink with him, which I was happy to do!
 Spent some time drinking with him, during which time he told me his family were visiting and they were having a big party. When it was time to go, he asked if I'd buy a bottle of wine for their party, which I agreed to do. He took me about a 10min ride away to a shop to buy wine, which cost 900,000 dong and then took me back to where we met. I realised at the time the wine was very expensive but I was a little drunk and didn't know where I was exactly so I didn't protest. I assume he just takes the wine back and splits the profits with the shop! 
 While we were drinking he took my email, I assume he'll try and have me send money for something else, but should I watch out for anything else? 
 Thanks for any advice!

 In Vietnam for 9 days and trying to get from Ha Long Bay to Hoi An. What‘s the best mode of travel? Is a sleeper bus too mad? Will the trains be too long and too much of a nightmare? We would just fly from Hanoi but it seems a shame not to see more of the country from the road / track. Or maybe that’s us being too romantic!
 Thanks!

I decided to go to the immigration department tomorrow to sort out my overstaying issue and hopefully also be able to extend my stay in hanoi for another 2 months. I came here as a foreigner alone for my summer vacation and I am afraid that because of this I might not be able to go back to my home country. Any advice on what should i do? I have asked around and some people say to just overstay for 2-3 months until you are fully recovered and pay a fine. while some say i should get to the immigration department as soon as possible even if it is difficult for me to move. I am really scared as I am alone and do not speak vietnamese.

This was at a bar on Saigons Bui Vien walking street. My wallet only had a few hundred thousand dong and a bank card that I canceled as soon as I noticed my wallet was gone. The bar staff told me to go to the police the following morning because they stop operating at 10pm. 
 I didn’t bother going to the police because it would be a waste of everyone’s time for such a small crime. But is this the truth? Or was the staff telling me this so that the police would not come to the bar and ruin the party?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please help!
 I was traveling for 2 weeks in Vietnam and purchased a Vietnamobile SIM
 I jsut got home to Australia, put my Dodo sim in my unlocked iphone xr, and suddently get SIM UNSUPPORTED error and it is now SIM locked. To Vietnamobile
 ​
 I have spent three days on chat to apple, dodo and vietnamobile, NOBODY is accepting responsibility, each company tells me it is the others responsibility
 ​
 Has anyone had this issue when returning home and if so, how did you unlock your phone?
 I live alone and have no phone access and cannot afford another iphone :(
 ​
 This must happen all the time to tourists, surely?
 ​
 Any help is SOOOOO appreciated, I am so stressed and exhausted trying to fix this
 ​
 TO ADD: So many of you have been so helpful, thankyou
 ​
 For the one who called me a troll and a luddite and illiterate, really unkind and unecessary to attack a stranger who has spent days trying to resolve this and been told different answers by Apple, and 3 different carriers / telcos. So yes, it is frustrating and stressful, and being called an idiot and a troll online is not helpful or kind.

 my wife and I are flying to Vietnam (for the first time ever) in October and we are not certain how to distribute the days among the different travel destinations and I was hoping you could help us a bit.
 We have a total of 15 days, including arrival on 22.10.2023 in Ho Chi Minh City at 07:35am and departure from Ha Noi at 11:30pm, and we are planning to fly to Da Nang to visit this city and Hoi An before we catch our next flight to Ha Noi.
 From Ha Noi, we would like to take the 3days/2nigts cruise to Ha Long Bay (or maybe Lan Ha Bay) and spend the remaining days in Ha Noi before flying home again.
 Our current plan is as follows:
 Arrival in HMC on Sunday, 21.10.2023 at 07:35am (Vietnam Airlines, already booked)

 I have a friend who is from Venezuela, and he’s living in Vietnam now.

 I am unfamiliar with Vietnam laws and would like to know more if possible please.
 There is a YouTube account owned by an individual that is believed to live in Vietnam. This individual post fake animal rescue videos. If you’re unfamiliar with this, the “rescuer” puts an animal in danger,harms, or injures the animal and then proceeds to record them being rescued for views and donations. 
 Their accounts are BA Animals Care Media and BAC. Both post the same content and are owned by the same person. Please do not view their videos as it will gain popularity that way. Instead report it to YouTube. 
 My questions are, are there any animal rights in Vietnam? Does authority take animal cruelty seriously? 
 I’ve reached out to a few rescue groups in Vietnam I found on google. I’m hoping they could help. But I would be grateful for any and all insight into this. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re looking to explore and do a food tour in Hanoi (which you should because there’s so much good food and if you don’t speak the language, it’s tough to know where to go) contact Ella Vu. (Contact info below) Just finished my food tour with her and she’s the sweetest kindest human and she took us to 8 different places and it was amazing. Holes in the wall you wouldn’t consider. Down alleyways up three flights of stairs to hidden spots. We have dietary restrictions (my husband doesn’t eat pork, which is tough here because 90% of food in Vietnam is based around pork and I’m mostly vegetarian) and she was able to accommodate us and still make the tour authentic and true to Hanoian culture and food. Her English was great and she was easy to talk to and get along with. She really deserves the shout out and recognition. We looked around for food tours and I saw someone mention her on here and I found her via Airbnb. But here’s her direct contact: +84 165 768 6004

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think for the most part, people in Vietnam are quite laidback and friendly. Why does it change so much when people are driving? A large number of people just turn into selfish assholes as soon as they're in control of a vehicle. Car drivers seem to consider the possibility of slowing down or giving way an insult to their ego. Bike drivers pay little attention to any kind of rules unless they're being watched by police. They'll drive the wrong way, break red lights, use sidewalks, pay zero attention to other traffic and refuse to stop at junctions. Buses and trucks only seem to have an accelerator and a horn. Everybody seems to be in a massive rush to get somewhere, yet when they arrive they just nonchalantly wander around like NPCs. 
 What's actually going on? I'm aware it's not everyone and you see plenty of people patiently waiting in traffic while those around them mount the sidewalk, but the sheer number of people that act like assholes on the road is way higher than in other countries. I don't think it just infrastructure because it happens even when the infrastructure is good. I also see people blame lack of education or poor people from the countryside, but you can cross the border into Laos and it's totally different experience

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me, the tones of Tiếng Bắc and Tiếng Nam sound the same for the most part, save for dấu hỏi and ngã. However, I noticed that the tones of Tiếng Huế sound vastly different from the first two: dấu sắc is lower rather than higher and sounds more like dấu hỏi, and dấu huyền is higher instead of slightly lower, but not as high as a typical dấu sắc. A few days ago I asked a Chinese friend what the four tones in Chinese sounded like, and I realized that they sounded very similar to Tiếng Huế’s tones. Dấu huyền of Tiếng Huế sounds like the falling tone of Chinese and dấu sắc sounds like the rising tone. I can’t speak for whether dấu hỏi/ngã sounds like the down-up tone, as I do not know what hỏi/ngã sounds like in Tiếng Huế. Why do Tiếng Huế’s tones sound similar to the Chinese tones? I’m guessing because Huế was the old capital of Việt Nam, most likely where most of the nobles/elites resided. Being a noble probably meant you probably had be able to speak in Mandarin and write in Chữ Hán/Nom, which likely had an influence on how they spoke Vietnamese. Can anyone confirm my theory?

 https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/general-jean-de-lattre-de-tassigny-vs-general-westmoreland.182885/
 I'mt not as into Vietnam as other wars but after stumbling into that article in link above I am now inquisitive.
 People far more familiar with Vietnamese history than I am especially those who read on the French Indochina War and later the American Vietnam War, whats your take? Is General De Lattre a much better general than Westmoreland was like OP claims in the link with his gigantic paragraph of details? I'm seeking a balanced view since the poster at Alternate History Forum is obviously super biased.
 I have heard of De Lattre prior to reading the article as one of the most famous French generals of the Second World. I also have seen documentaries that stated Westmoreland was an artillery officer during the War too. So they were obviously both contemporaries. But I didn't know much more than that prior to reading the article.

 You can get basically anything they sell for much cheaper in tons of other places (even online with delivery within 2 hours).
 Don't shop like a tourist... You guys are the reason their prices remain so unrealistic, you're letting them scam you with every purchase.
 Edit: I'm so happy to see everyone agrees! Much smarter people here than in that foodies group 😂

 It inspires me to finally start my own brand but in Vietnam instead. The market seems to be stronger for local brands. Google isn’t the most helpful as it seems to push Vietnamese manufacturers to sell in North America. Does anyone have any contacts or an idea on where I can start to find manufacturers or designers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The news that Vietnam will have 70 Michelin Guide honored restaurants in 2023 is encouraging and long overdue. Vietnam's unique culinary traditions, blending multiple regional styles with influences from China and France, produce some of the world's most iconic and delicious dishes.
 From pho to banh mi, spring rolls to imperial court cuisine, Vietnamese food withstands comparison with the finest culinary traditions anywhere. The creativity, skill and passion of Vietnamese chefs across the country have produced cooking that has long deserved global renown.
 Having 70 Michelin-reviewed establishments will help showcase the diversity and quality of Vietnam's dynamic restaurant scene to an international audience. It will attract more food tourists, boosting the hospitality industry and local economies. Most importantly, it provides deserved recognition for the craftsmanship and dedicated hard work of Vietnamese chefs over generations.
 As a Vietnamese, I have long taken for granted the pleasures of Vietnam's cuisine. But global acknowledgement from prestigious groups like Michelin will be a source of pride for Vietnamese people everywhere. It demonstrates that our culture's softest power - our food - can compete on the world stage. I hope this is just the beginning and that more Vietnamese culinary masters will have their talents spotlighted in the years to come.
 Vietnamese restaurants have earned their place amongst the finest in the world. I hope the Michelin Guide and other international reviewers will help spread the word and introduce more people to the joys of Vietnamese gastronomy. Our chefs deserve this honor - now it's time for the world to feast their eyes and taste buds on what Vietnam has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in and out of Vietnam quite a bit over the past year for work. I've been using Zalo to communicate to my driver and team members when I'm back at my apartment / out of the office (I don't have Facebook, so this was a good alternative while out here).
 Unfortunately, I had to replace my phone last time and Zalo put me through some loops to basically "re authenticate" me by having someone already in my Zalo contacts confirm it's me. Naturally, that happened a few days before I flew back out here, so I was unable to get in touch with anyone when I landed (didn't realize this was needed until I landed). I eventually got hold of someone and they did the in-person verification.
 However, ever since then, the Zalo app keeps telling me I need to "verify" my account. It has an option to upload a photo of your passport but it doesn't seem to like an American passport. Do I need to verify? How do I do this? Anyone have experience making it work?
 I tried to chat with Zalo support but they only would message me in Vietnamese. I really only use this to keep in touch with my team, does verify even matter?

 I am planning another out of country trip to Mexico in a few months as well and need my passport - in order to renew by mail you must send in your passport and I am worried it won't get back in time for my trip to Mexico. I don't want to send it after MX because there are so many delays with passports right now due to covid. Will it be fine?

 Phan Thi Kim Puc the girl in this photograph was 8 years old living in a small village in 1972 when it was shot. Doctors did not really give a chance to her looking at the severe burns on her body. However extensive surgery helped her to come through the ordeal. She later did her medicine in Cuba , where she met her future husband Bui Huy Toan. The couple later migrated to Canada , where they settled near Toronto. In 1997 she set up the Kim Phuc Foundation to help child victims of war. Truly remarkable lady.

 I am considering doing the ha giang loop on the back of an easy rider on my upcoming trip. Two main concerns I have are:
  
Is the weather in the region suitable for the tour during August?
 
I asked the tour guide people if a 130kg (im a big guy) person would be suitable to ride on these bikes with an easy rider, and they said “130 should be fine”
 
 Should?!
 I fully understand if I’m not able to go but that kind of animosity scares me haha. Should I ask again? is it too risky? 
 I would appreciate responses, thank you!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is mostly aimed at people living in Hanoi and the surrounding provinces. 
 As some of you may know, there is a power shortage that will continue throughout June. The official word is that power cuts will be occuring daily due to "El Nino". 
 Over the past week or so, my district (Long Bien) has experienced 5 outages that last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours at a time. We're told about them in the morning, so there isn't much time to plan around them as they start at 8 AM. 
 Tonight, we've been told (officially) that the outages will occur each day for the next month. In my 9 years living in Hanoi, I've never experienced this before, yes, occasionally power will cut during a typhoon, but never like this. 
 Does anyone else who is currently going through this have a backup generator? Is it worth investing in one? My wife and I run our business from home and we need to be online 24/7. We can't be out of the house for too long as we have 2 dogs that only pee outside and our son comes home for lunch and a nap each day. 
 Need advice on how to deal with it. Can't move because we own our property. Should I buy a generator? Have you heard any information about the power cuts that might shed more light than our building's manager has already? Do you know someone who works in the energy sector that has mentioned it to you? Feeling absolutely helpess RN.

But talking about some beliefs, they say that Our Lady made an apparition in La Vang 17/August/1798, what I particularly believe, as a Catholic. I'm not here to discuss religion itself, but I'd like to know your thoughts on that and, if someone has a picture/statue/icon, a photo of it (please 😀)

We are into nightlife, we party, close daytime social areas to meet people, make new friends, hit the gym, convenient parks to walk the dogs, prefer near waterfront with a water view, good mix of Việt and foreigners. Where do we look to live? We currently live in Hanoi on the lake, next to a park, lots of people gather and meet. We would love something similar. Places we have seen on listing that intrique us: Icon 56 building D2 Sanwah Pearl Golden River looks nice but no dogs. Suggestions welcome
 We want a mix of social, access to everything we want to buy, not overpriced but we aren't cheap, unique, where we can easily meet like singles and couples.

 I was wondering if anyone would be able to share any resources or guides for medical terminology in Vietnamese? I was working at a clinic and got lost with the word "glaucoma." Alternatively, I would to practice my Vietnamese with a partner if anyone is interested! I grew up speaking some Vietnamese but am really hoping to become more fluent. 
 Thank you!

 I'm trying to look for a tattoo shop that offers somewhat reasonably priced services. I've been offered around 200 USD for 12*9cm minimalist designs. 
 Do you guys have any other shops to recommend?

However, there is a chance I will stay in the north and then go to Laos and Thailand. So, right now all I have is my one way plane ticket to Hanoi. Do I need to show proof of a departing flight when arriving in Vietnam? The last time I was in Vietnam I did have a departing flight but I don't remember what the protocol was/if they checked it.

 I am not sure whether to take malaria tablets. I am rather risk averse when it comes to health. Could you please advise on this?

They were all talking about how they rent apartments here for peanuts, and simply eat Bahn Mis and plow fresh young Vietnamese chicks on the daily.
 One guy buys like 100 pills of viagra and uses them all in under two months. He’s a lawyer and just has a broker who sends him up fresh meat multiple times a day.
 To be honest, it was kind of repulsive to hear about all this. I’ve been having a great time with the locals and it’s kind of nuts how all these women are getting used and abused by westerners. What do local Vietnamese think about this? They seem to be happy with throwing their daughters to the viagra popping wolves of the west.

 Mọi thứ cứ trôi qua êm đẹp như vậy, đi làm kiếm tiền như bao người. Cho đến khi vợ tôi nghỉ công tác tại ngân hàng M… Việc này làm tôi khá khủng hoảng về tinh thần khi làm ca kíp về và liên tục bị trì triết, phàn nàn về nhiều thứ. Và vợ tự sinh ra cái suy nghĩ nghỉ làm thành gánh nặng của tôi, mặc dù tôi cũng rất tán thành việc nghỉ nếu công việc quá áp lực và không hiệu quả về kinh tế. 
 Tôi chả biết do nghiệp hay duyên làm tôi có quen được 1 chị tiếp viên hơn tôi 3 tuổi vào đúng thời gian này. Không ai chủ động, chỉ nói chuyện về công việc rồi chia sẻ về cuộc sống, dần rà sau 1 tháng điều gì đến sẽ đến. Vâng, tôi có cãi nhau với vợ và rủ chị kia đi Hạ Long chơi và có qhtd. Ban đầu mục đích của tôi chỉ là giải toả căng thẳng, bằng một cách thần cmn kỳ xong chị ta yêu tôi. Rồi ngày qua ngày, việc chị ta cứ chia sẻ công việc (cùng ngành) mua đồ, quan tâm đến tôi cũng làm tôi có chút rung động :)
 Thực sự việc này tôi đã biết là sai ngay từ lúc rủ chị ta đi Hạ Long, tôi cũng vẫn rất yêu vợ mình chứ. Nhưng bản tính tham lam và râm tục của tôi làm tôi vẫn muốn giữ mối quan hệ này :( Chị ta cũng biết tôi có vợ và vẫn chấp nhận làm người thứ 3… Sau khi chia sẻ những lời này thì tôi vẫn đang có một gia đình đáng yêu và vẫn duy trì mqh ngoài luồng. Tôi sai rồi!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My parents and the older generation of my family, those who immigrated to the US, have always said that American and Western foods are always too salty or too sweet. They always say that too much salt or sugar is used. They also say this is why American food is so unhealthy.
 I’ve mainly been raised up in the US and eat both Asian and Western cuisines but never found this to be true. I’ve always found most foods to be reasonably seasoned to my tastes. I’ve asked friends and family around my age, and they also generally agree with me. I also believe the whole “American food is unhealthy” myth to be untrue because that really only applies to fast food which you really don’t eat on a daily basis. It’s also a huge over generalization of American cuisine considering how diverse each region and state is. I digress though. Is it really true that Vietnamese/Asian cuisine use less salt/sugar and are healthier than American/Western cuisine, or is this more of a subjective to taste thing?

 I’m looking to see if there is any sort of Hip Hop scene in Saigon? Have it be gigs, shops, painters, dancers, rappers and singer, anything really. I’m a street artist here in Australia and found a bit of a scene last year in Hanoi, so surely there is something going in in Saigon. 
 Also, looking to go and see some good live music, both traditional and if there is any contemporary gigs. I’ve found the opera which will be great to go to. But I’m open to anything really! Also if there is any race scene at all? I’ve found a few clubs that have potential like Arcan. 
 Thanks in advanced everyone. I’m so excited to be back in Vietnam next week!!!

 I actually got along really well with my girl, and we talked quite a bit (a lot of it using google translate). After everything was said and done, I was gathering my belongings, I asked her what she recommended I do for fun in Hanoi. On google translate she said, "I don't know, I only stay here" and she had kind of a weird look on her face.
 It was kind of strange, like she just looked at me for a moment, the continued dressing me. 
 What do you think that meant?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! :) Basically, I'm creating this ARG (alternate reality game) and in it, I'm trying to create this Vietnamese person who is essentially the main character. Mainly I need help with the name. I'm trying to come up with a name that would utilize the Vietnamese word for descent; the name would be made by splitting up the word into syllables that could then be used to create a full name (ex: like the word danger being used to create the name daniel criminger). Unfortunately, I do not know a lick of Vietnamese. 
 I'm struggling with two things: 
 A) I'd like to be able to find a correct translation of the Vietnamese word for descent. I've tried a bunch of websites including Google Translate and ChatGPT and they all come up with different answers and 
 B) I'd like to be able to come up with a realistic name, something that actually sounds believable, if that makes sense. I'm sorry if it's a large request but any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

 Now, I’m trying to book hotels, and I want a very nice 4 or 5 star hotel in a modern area of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. 
 I’m looking for hotels similar to jw Marriott (Hanoi), they’re fully booked for my dates so any similar will do. And if anyone can recommend me anything for Ho Chi Minh I’d be grateful!

 My wife’s bà nội died suddenly, we won’t be able to make it to Vietnam in time for the funeral. 
 She’s already burned some incense at our tiny shrine. But she’s not practising and does this stuff more out of habit than anything else.
 What could I do on the day of the funeral to mark my respect? I was thinking to print a picture of her and get a small bouquet of white lilies and putting them on the shrine. Is that appropriate?

I’ve found a few shops but they all seem to sell new acoustic stock. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 EDIT: Some people are asking how this relates to r/vietnam, I just wanted some more Việt Kiều/mainlander perspectives to see if there’s something I’m missing in navigating this mess. 
 We had seen the first one together and they enjoyed it, so I thought they might like this. But they clearly didn’t, and even talked badly about it during the movie. EDIT: It was too artsy and chaotic for them. Too much going on.
 It’s okay if they didn’t like it since we are worlds apart when it comes to media consumption. I just hate that they didn’t at least stay and experience the movie with me and my brother. It had been a while since we had gone out to the movie theaters as a family.
 To make it worse, my brother is very hot tempered and told them to shut up several times while they were critiquing the movie, and even as they were walking out. I get where his frustration is coming from, but I don’t agree with how disrespectful he was. 
 They waited for us outside in the car. On the ride home, I tried to keep the conversation light even if I was slightly annoyed. 
 But the tension was clear. And when they confronted my brother about snapping at them, they all started yelling at each other. 
 We just got home and there was a lot of door slamming. I feel really sad. If I had known the evening would end this way, I would have just gone to see the movie myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 👋 My boyfriend and I are working on applying to jobs in Vietnam, starting this week. Before we do this, we are sorting out our CVs and cover letters.
 I am a qualified English teacher with a 4-year Education degree specializing in English language. I have 6 years of experience in the industry.
 My boyfriend is a graphic designer and photographer and holds a 3-year bachelor degree in the above field, he has a 180-hour TEFL course certification and has 7 years experience. 
 He is designing our CVs from scratch, to suit our specific aesthetic wants. I have some questions regarding what Vietnamese schools might look for in a CV/what is considered professional:
 • He is holding a chihuahua in his head shot, it is a professional and very striking photo. Would this be considered strange to a Vietnamese recruiter?
 • My CV is working with a colour palette of pink and grey, are there better colours I could choose that recruiters might find more appealing or make my CV stand out more?
 • What are some specific categories in CVs that recruiters look at?
 • Is there any way we can strengthen our chances/make our CVs stand out from the rest?
 Thank you so much, this subreddit is a godsend.

 Porn is illegal in Vietnam. How do they even enforce that? Customs confiscates your devices for a thorough inspection? The government tracks your internet activity?

Cost: Will the wedding cost similar at both locations? Assuming similar type of venue and decoration. 
 
Weather: preferably we want outdoor wedding. From our initial search, it may rain in DaNang in December? 
 
Venue availability in December: DaNang seem to be busy with tourists during December 
 
 Main reason for considering DaNang/ Hoi An is half of the guests are non Vietnamese and these locations are unique to Vietnam. Since they are traveling to Vietnam, and may not travel again in future DaNang/ Hoi An has more cultural and tourist things todo. We might be wrong, but we don’t see something similar in or nearby Ho Chi Minh City. We would like your opinion/ suggestions.

 I'm travelling through vietnam right now and I was looking for advice from some viet natives. I am solo travelling and just can't seem to meet people and have remotely lengthy conversations. I keep trying but it doesn't seem to be working. I'm currently in hanoi (old quarter). I've been walking around all day, searching online and trying to find events or language exchange communities. Looking online everyone seems to be saying its super easy to meet people here so I don't know why I'm struggling. I am usually very confident talking to people back home, but it seems this language barrier is impeding me more than others.
 Any advice would be much appreciated as I'm a very social person and tend to be far happier when with people.

 These days i really miss banh mi sandwich but there are no places to have original, legit, authentic banh mi. So I ordered this ham to make it at home. What’s the difference? Gio lua and cha chien
 Q.2 
 I prepared 
 Baguette 
 Cucumber Cilantro Pickled Carrot/radish
 Vietnamese Ham 
 Cholimex hot sauce / mayo/ butter 
 Can you recommend me some ingredients to make better banh mi? Is this basic ingredient rigth? 
 What is the genuine banh mi recipe? I googled it and searched it on YouTubed but it seems complicated than original one 🤔

 I am looking for a way to travel from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi by bus.
 I searched for buses on google through baolau, vexere, and sinhtourist, but none of them go directly from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi.
 The only way I can find is to get off in Da Nang or Hue and then book a new ticket.
 I've seen information that Mailinh Express runs this route, but when I look it up on their website, it says there are no buses.
 Can someone tell me how to get from Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi directly without any transfers?
 Thank you.

 If anyone knows of any gyms where expats go or are used to training expats that would be great.
 Im also open to regular boxing. So if anyone knows any good expat gyms that do that too, I'd love to hear it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on contract for 2 more months in my apartment. I pay 13 mil a month. They're making 3 more rooms on this floor right next to my room so the noise is CONSTANT and LOUD. I cannot sleep. It's every morning and weekend.
  Also, my roof has been leaking. I have a bucket to collect most of the water, but I need to empty it and mop the floor every time it rains. I've been asking them to fix it for a month or reduce my rent but now I just want to leave. 
 I pay too much for this to be my reality. I only moved here because it was pet friendly, but my cat died 2 months ago. I'm off work for one month and would like to move while I have time, but they will not break my contact without keeping my security deposit, even if I feel the spirit of my contract is broken. How do I break the lease and get my money back so I can move? Am I shit out of luck? Cheers thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I've heard that the installlation fee, maintenance fee, operation fee of having Air Conditioners (AC) in some western countries costs an arm and leg. And people in some countries in Europe don't have AC at home, according to some of my friends in France, Spain and UK.
 Sales of portable air-conditioning units rose 2,420 percent in a week, British retailer Sainsbury’s said during the hot season last year. Some in Europe are coming to accept that some AC usage may be needed to save lives. After a heat wave killed an estimated 15,000 people in France in 2003, air conditioning was introduced to some nursing homes in a bid to protect the most vulnerable. 
 How do you guys feel about AC in Vietnam, where the prices are cheap and almost every household in urban cities like Hanoi or Saigon has at least one. AC in hot nation like Vietnam is true love or a threat to the environment?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Vietnamese passport expired a few years ago and I want to renew it. I looked it up on the NY consulate website and it looks like for expired passport renewal you basically have to apply for a new one. But the forms for that asks a lot about pre-immigration life such as where I lived, why I left, any and all relative information including their addresses, etc. And I don’t have all this information since I moved here when I was super young and I don’t know all my relatives especially their Vietnamese names and addresses. More importantly the forms are all in Vietnamese so I’m assuming I’d have to answer in Vietnamese but I don’t speak/read/write Vietnamese. I’ve tried calling the NY consulate but haven’t gotten through to them. Looking for any advice to make this process easier

We are comfortable with ourselves in term of PDA in cities in the states, but I am afraid we would be stared and verbally attacked. I do speak the language so the shaming may scare me. 
 My partner is from Hungary and we received that treatment when we visited the country. I do want to show him the beauty and food culture in Vietnam, yet not wanting to run into any trouble just because we are both men.

Is that reasonable? The other thing I was wondering was whether I could just book a grab from the airport to our hotel in Tam Coc or is that going to be a trip most won't take?

 Most offers there are "some locals" looking for teachers and not actual schools/centers, it seemed not legit to me but what i know is that everything works differently in Vietnam, right? 
 My question is, how legit are those offers? Is there anyone here that was hired this way through a local on facebook? 
 I would appreciate your help.

The train officer (man with hat and blue uniform) came to my cabin (I am with a friend in the first class 4 berth cabin) and showed me a translation on his phone saying there will be people coming to our cabin next stop, and he can transfer them to another cabin so we can stay alone if I pay him 450,000 Dong. I payed him. Scam or real?

 So a diverse answer is okay. Whenever you live in any city
 You can also give your personal range of cost of living as a person living by himself/herself
 I want to know or to be as grounded as possible on how natives live their life every day

 One of them is her views on spanking children.
 Do most Vietnamese mothers spank?
 Growing up in the United States, it was one of those things that was usually considered private and only discussed with close friends so I honestly cannot even give an answer for how common it is in The United States (perhaps she will have a similar honest answer).
 In the United States, I would say that it about half and half (but that is only from my experience).

 I'm planning a journey for myself and husband. We're first-time travellers to Vietnam this year in late August / early September. Any tips for off the beaten track tours of 1 or 2 days on the Mekong Delta? We're used to road-trips and bumping into authentic experiences with people, a local guide in this case will probably give us insights we wouldn't otherwise have. I found something by Innoviet and Local-insider, but I still don't know if that is what we're looking for. Any tips will be much appreciated.
