        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm staying for 3 months, originally rented a place already. When I arrived, everything was not as advertised and/or broken and the landlord hangs up on me. I need to find a new place to stay soon.
 I am looking for a place with 2 rooms, already furnished, kitchen, wifi, and a/c. 
 I see that the posts here usually say to look on facebook but can someone recommend me some groups? 
 As for district, probably 5,8,10? but I am open to other districts as well.
 Has anyone rented a place similar to what I am looking for? What does it usually cost? Please give me an idea of what to expect in cost to rent!
 I've asked around and see that a lot of places only allow you to rent if you plan to stay for 6 + months. I would rather have it month by month since I don't want to run into the same issue I am having now with my current place.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because Vinfast is popular in Vietnam with the Vinfast Fadil being one of the best sellers in the past three years, do you think Vinfast would be popular towards Vietnamese Americans, given the fact there are many Vietnamese Americans who are anti-communist (like many of my mother's relatives who live in the US)?
 Also, I am curious if Vietnamese Americans are willing to buy a Vinfast or would they choose another car (like a Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Volvo, Porsche, VW, Polestar, GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, etc)? For me, even though I was born in Vietnam and currently live in the US (my parents still live in Vietnam however), I am not thinking of getting a Vinfast as there are many EVs which offer better value for the money, in my opinion (like Hyundai Ioniq 5, where there is a better brand cachet).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. For years I've been using a Garmin 66i for my hiking across Europe and North America. I recently started travelling to Vietnam for work, spending weeks at a time there (4 trips this year already, 82 days in country total - just since August). I brought my 66i and I've been doing hikes with some of the locals on the weekends. It's been amazing. However, I've come to find that my Garmin has almost no detail about any of the areas I hike in. No trails, no contour, no roads. Many times it is blank. It's fine for tracking where I go, should I need to find my way out, but it's a pain to try and plan or navigate some of our hikes when I can't really see what is out there.
 I checked Garmin's website and there's no maps to purchase. There seems to be third parties selling SE-Asia maps but I can't really get a read on how trustworthy they are.
 Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations? I'm heading back out in a few weeks for a 6 week trip, one week of which we'll be going deep into the woods in northern Vietnam for 4 nights 5 days hiking and exploring caves. I'd like to have my garmin properly giving me information.

 I don’t want to cause any offence and want to tip him and the driver. (I’m on the way back now) 
 Is for example 500000 Dong the right amount / too much / too little?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am planning to visit Vietnam soon, and it occurred to me that New Years Eve is approaching soon, and I was wondering if this is a good time to visit Vietnam.
 I am interested in meeting local people, not so much interested in simply partying and getting plastered with other expats/tourists. Are the local people of Vietnam keen on hanging out for NYE celebrations? Or is the lunar new year more popular of a holiday in VN?
 Also, what are some good ways to meet people and learn about the people and culture in VN? From what I've read, if you look like a foreigner (I am 190cm white guy from America lol) people will talk to you if they see you eating by yourself and are generally quite friendly. Is this true? I'd love to meet people and feel warm and welcome, unlike when I went to Australia and it felt almost the same as America--super lonely and hard to meet people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all, 
 I have lived and worked in Vietnam for the last 5 years. But recently I have been denied entry to Vietnam and I don't know why. I left Vietnam to get a TRC which requires foreigners to leave Vietnam and come back on a business visa in order to obtain a TRC. However I have been denied by Hanoi immigration due to a 'immigration violation'. 
 I still do not know exactly what the problem is and how to fix it! I am more than happy to pay a fine. I have tried many times to call and email Hanoi immigration but still no reply. I even visited Vietnam embassy in Thailand and London but they couldn't help. 
 Is there anyone that can help me or give me a contact with someone that works in VN immigration so I can speak to them directly and fix this problem. 
 I have wasted a lot of money and time on agents who take my money under many promises but then do not help at all!
 I am a British citizen and currently living in London. I appreciate any help and kind of desperate as I have all my clothes, my jobs, my apartment, everything still in Saigon :( 
 Thank you all

 Moving to Saigon in February and want to carry on kickboxing or start muay thai etc.
 All of the gyms I have found online, the prices are pretty crazy. I understand I'll probably find inflated prices but to pay 200 - 300 dollars a month is quite a shock haha.
 Does anyone have any recommendations of mma/ muay Thai/ kickboxing gyms that are not expat traps?
 Again, Im not expecting to pay local prices.
 Any help is appreciated 🙏

 I’m travelling to the following locations:
 Hanoi Ninh Bing Hoi An Nha Trang Ho Chi Minh
 Thanks!

We live in Vietnam. I normally drive an electric motorbike and don't have a motorbike license. I have a TRC. I've learned that one of the leading motorbike rental shops (QT Motorbikes) will rent a motorbike to me, but they require that I leave my passport with them. I don't like doing that. (Also, I might need my passport at a hotel or if the police stop us.) I'm looking for recommendations for a motorbike rental in Ha Giang that will rent a semi-automatic bike to me for two days without requiring my passport as a deposit. Thanks
 Edit: Would welcome hotel recommendations in Ha Giang and places to see within a few hours' motorbike ride, too.

 Expenses such as Flights and accommodation are covered which is nice and is why I took the offer. I have never been outside of Europe and have no real idea what to expect. 
 I'm eager to have this new experience and see a completely different culture and hopefully meet some nice people :)
 What should I expect? And any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tried to find some data online and struggled to find what I was looking for. Perhaps because the resource may be in Vietnamese?
 I’m curious about the wealth distribution by age in Vietnam. Been in Vietnam for a few weeks now. I’ve noticed a lot of people in their late 20s/30s wear nicer/designer clothes and tend to have fancier bikes than those older than 40. Although, I also know people that are younger may tend to care about these visual indicators of wealth more.
 Vietnam is a rapidly modernizing country, so I’d assume people born in the late 80s/90s have had better career opportunity? Curious about people’s perspective here. Assuming that the fallouts of the wars with America and China took some time to economically recover from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time I booked them. Actually booked AA but the carrier was JAL. I thought JAL had a decent reputation.
 Other than some super efficient and sweet stewardesses this was not a good experience. 
  
Tried to upgrade to an emergency aisle seat for 100$. At first the very nice Caucasian worker said ok. But after checking with the Japanese JAL rep they said no. Only Japanese citizens can book it. Huh????? Can you imagine if AA said only Americans can book certain seats?
 
Inflight entertainment really blew. The movie selection was like a scarce selection of movies one might find at a rummage sale. They did have one James Bond movie. I ended up watching that and Shawshank Redemption for the umpteenth time. The hardware interface had such lag you never knew if a button press actually worked. Had to restart a few times. I know it's a lot to ask but nowadays a selection of podcasts is pretty common. Also, and this is in general, why can't airlines offer live newsfeeds? JAL had a day old BBC International segment and one Japanese language news segment.
 
I sat economy. The seat was particularly torturous even for economy. It was hard and small. I spent the last 6 hours of the flight rotating my position trying to find new unused parts of my ass that would give me ten minutes of relief. I'm a medium size guy.
 
The food was typical airline food in this case limited to Japanese cuisine That was ok by me but I thought I'd mention it. I had two legs on this flight: BOS to NRT (14 hrs) and NRT to SGN,( 6 hrs).Both flights had the exact same menu. I just skipped meal service completely on the second flight. 
 
 Maybe my experience was a one-off. Anyone want to share?
 Thanks.

 I am currently visiting Vietnam and really enjoy the country, culture and cuisine! Therefore I want to buy some nice chopsticks as a souvenir for home that reminds me of this country whenever I try to replicate one of the delicious dishes.
 But so far I could only find some on the night markets and they don't look good or of good quality to be honest. I am looking for a nice design, wooden and local/handmade would be a nice addition. Currently I am in Hanoi and will be leaving soon. Googeling brought me to these of Hanoi Desing Center ( http://hanoidesigncentre.com/product/570-wooden-chopsticks-m17). But unfortunately the shop doesn't seem to exist anymore, I checked the location and they don't reply on Facebook.
 Do you know any stories where I can get something like this? I would really like to find some nice ones. Thank you!

Does anyone knows if VN bank allows me to withdraw from VN dong and convert to U.S. dollars? Any paperwork I have to show such as where the source of the money?
 ​
 I will be bringing these U.S. dollars oversea by cash physically. I am aware we have to report more than 5000 dollars at the custom at VN airport. It will be more than 5000 dollars. I heard something about 30 percent tax on the amount carried that are declared?

I've read that jewellery stores give you the best rate but does anybody have any specific spots in D3 so I don't have to travel too far with my cash? 
 Also I plan on getting a VN sim, if I call around to some stores to ask what their exchange rate is would they understand English? I don't know any Vietnamese outside of random food menu items lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i'm moving to Vietnam in a couple weeks to teach English for the first time. I want to live in District 3 or Binh Tanh but the language centres I've been offered are all around a 20 minute drive from these places. So it looks like ima have to rent/buy a motorbike/scooter. I currently don't have a license but I've read you can ride a 50cc scooter without one. How easy/doable would it be to rent a 50cc motorbike for a 40 minute round-trip each day?
 After I've settled in a little, I'll probably work on getting a license.
 In the meantime, does anyone know of any other ways to get about the city that wouldn't be as expensive as getting a taxi every day?
 Cheers

 I’m spending 30 days in Vietnam and don’t really mind the cost as such but I want something that will work the entire duration, not something that will work 1 day and shit bricks the following. If you got a sim at the airport, which kiosk did you go to? 
 I went back in April and had no issues with grabbing a random kiosk seller sim but seem like a lot of people are reporting issues of reliable sim at the airport lately.

 I love American, don’t get me wrong. I feel as if people in Vietnam are more genuine and kind. I don’t think I’ve smiled as often at home. 
 I’m sure this is coming from a place of privilege. But I have a deep feeling of belonging here. I’m sure I will be back for business. But I wish I could stay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted another opinion on this as I want to be safe.
 Me and my partner are interested in doing the Ha Giang loop in a few days. My partner has been driving all over southeast Asia with me on the back for the past several months with no issues. However, we've only ever driven an automatic and we're a bit nervous as I saw a couple posts on here that said a semi automatic or manual was needed to do the loop. We messaged the scooter rental we rented from before when we did the Hai Van pass to ask them about the loop and they told us it was safe to do the loop on a 125cc automatic scooter with two people on it. We wanted something a bit bigger if we could do it on an automatic but they don't have anything over 125cc.
 Just wondering from people who have done it recently, especially with all the construction I've read about, if they felt that would be adequate. If not, maybe we might get a lesson on the semi automatic when we get to Ha Giang and see how comfortable we feel on it before deciding what to do? 
 Thanks!

Does anyone know how difficult this is or if it’s even possible? I don’t think it’s as simple as turning up with a stall? I imagine if it’s “first come first served” the locals would not be very happy about you beating them to it. I would think there’s some regulation and rent to be paid though? 
 She is looking into it but was hoping someone here might know something about it!

I have a pretty sensitive back so just wondering if the hotels' beds will be the same as beds in people's houses? If so, is it likely that I can find hotels with softer beds for foreigners or be able to check what kind of beds each hotel has before I book?

 The Ha Giang Loop is an iconic ride through Northern Vietnam. Stunning mountain passes, delicious food, and chilly weather are certainly the highlights of the trip. 
 It's absolutely on the tourist circuit, however. Be prepared to pass swarms of tourists, both domestic and foreign, on small scooters. Nearly every guest house in the towns you stop at will be full and, most likely, will have a party going on. 
 Overall, an excellent ride that I'd highly recommend.

I currently own a Timemore C2 grinder, Aeropress go, Hario french press, some phin filter & a cheap shopee scale (but the timer couldn't work anymore). I am listing them so you can have a good gauge of my budget vs quality.
 I am thinking of getting a gooseneck kettle, a new scale & V60. 
 1) Gooseneck Kettle: I am not sure if I should get a temp controlled one at this point. But I want a small one. Not those 1L and above. Looking at Hario or time more
 2) V60: Plastic, ceramic vs copper?
 3) Just get a cheap one from amazon? Is it worth to get so expensive. whats the diff?
 What brands and model should I be looking at?

In the beginning, she was eating a sandwich. By the end, the mustache fell off her face, and funnily she takes the mustache and stick it between her brows like a unibrow and also onto his face. At one point, to show masculinity she pulls her pants up all gungho and declared 'I AM MAN!' in English. The boyfriend was so nervous that he was trembling so much to the point that he shook off the couch and fell onto the floor. She was later revealed to be female.

The singer or the person it was focusing on is a female with red hair, actual blood-red or rose-red hair. The world is about to end with astroids or meteors hitting Earth. The female goes about her day while everything is in chaos around. At one point she was at the gas station getting gas and at a store getting groceries while everyone around her is panicking. By the end of the music video, she is eating a (romantic) dinner with someone (maybe not human) while a meteor is about to hit the earth.

 One concern is dating, how does dating in VietNam differ to western societies?

 Is there anything I should be conscious of?

This weekend I was at a temple and as we were leaving I went to grab my shoes from the shelf but an older lady was in front so I said “xin lỗi bà...” She turned around and said some things I did not understand, but from her tone I’m pretty sure they weren’t very happy. 
 Did I insult her?? Is there something different I should have said?? Not sure if this is the right place for this question but everyone here is very nice so figured I’d give it a shot.

Planning to use a mobile wallet (either GrabPay or Alipay) mainly for paying goods in malls and restaurants just to get by for less than 3 days in the city and I feel like I don’t necessarily need to withdraw cold, hard cash in DONG since I’ll be staying in my hotel anyway working most of the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào mọi người!! Recently on TikTok, you see a lot of people talk about their travels overseas and eating the same, if not more, but still losing weight. Or vice versa, with exchange/international students, moving to the States and gaining so much weight. I’m wondering if the same could be said about Vietnam about the food quality, I know there’s a lot of processed food in every country but Vietnam is high on the list of countries with the healthiest diets! Does anyone have similar experiences with weight fluctuations while traveling between Vietnam and the States? I’m moving there soon and I’m really curious!

 I have a query regarding a travel route from Ho Chi Minh City to Krong Siem Reap. My preference is towards traveling by road as I have been told it's very economical compared to the flight. Along with that, I wish to know how comfortable that journey is and would you recommend it to someone who is traveling there for the first time.
 Looking forward for your helpful and insightful responses. I surely believe that I will have many more queries and I have utmost faith in the fact that most of them will be solved through this subreddit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm looking for a cover of an old Vietnamese Magazine "Chinh Luan" from 1972. It would have been published sometime between May and August 1972 and features a Soldier standing on top of a tank on the cover. The magazine cover format is similar to this :https://nhacxua.vn/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chinh-luan.jpg 
 It features a family member of mine so I would happily pay a high price for a good quality scan of this cover or even more for the magazine itself or both. I'm not sure where to start, but wanted to reach out on Reddit in case anyone might know or even have this copy of the magazine. Thanks!

However a few people say Vietnamese made products are no better, usually citing (without sources) that Vietnam uses low-wage workers as well.
 Now unfortunately I am quite unaware of the living condition of Vietnamese workers. Would you say Vietnamese workers are generally better? I know it's not the best job but would you say it's good enough? Sometimes there's even absurd claim like slavery worker but I do not believe it happens in Vietnam (at least legally/endorsed). Would you say Vietnamese made products are more ethical? How would you respond to the above criticism?

We're all American (naturalized) citizens now and I don't think we have our Vietnamese citizenships (my parents currently live in Vietnam and they had to get a visa to do so). I'm handling some (American) paperwork for my parents and unfortunately they've requested a copy of my parents' birth certificates which we don't have. What would be the easiest way of getting this?
 From looking around online it sounds like my parents would have to get one from a Vietnamese embassy/consulate but it's a weird situation because they're not Vietnamese citizens anymore. My parents have US passports for reference.

I really found amazing how Hanoi has a lot of physical and consistent activities for the youngsters. It made me wish we have something as lively as this in my country.

 Coming April I wanna take a motorbike and travel through Vietnam for about 3 weeks. I have my European motorcycle license, so I'm fairly confident on the bike.
 I've always wanted to do a tour between Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, mainly riding through the mainland. However, after doing some research I get a lot of sources saying the north of Hanoi is the place to be.
 On one hand I'd love to get as much a vibe of Vietnam as possible, which seems the Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi would provide best. On the other hands, if the best sites are in the north, then I can totally be convinced to go there.
 Is there anyone who could give me some advice on this?
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, apologies for using English and the google translation below. 
 ​
 I LOVE FOOD!!! One of the most exciting parts of coming to Vietnam for me is learning about the culture and food that Vietnamese people are so beautifully famous for. 
 ​
 My problem(?) is that I have had gastric sleeve surgery so I can't eat much. Generally in Australia, my husband and I order one meal to share, but if I want something he can't eat or doesn't like, I will order my own meal and take the leftovers home to reheat later. That's going to be a little hard when I'm trying to eat as many different type of Vietnamese food as possible.
 ​
 Would it be offensive or "bad" for me to order a whole meal for myself and leave a lot of leftovers? I'd love for us to order 2 different Pho's and get to experience both but would it be a bad thing if we didn't eat it all? 
 Any tips on how to explain/apologise for my limited eating capacity will be well received!!!! PLEASE! 
 Google translate below:
 Xin chào tất cả, xin lỗi vì sử dụng tiếng Anh và bản dịch google bên dưới.
 ​
 TÔI YÊU THỰC PHẨM!!! Một trong những phần thú vị nhất khi đến Việt Nam đối với tôi là tìm hiểu về văn hóa và ẩm thực mà người Việt Nam vốn nổi tiếng xinh đẹp.
 ​
 Vấn đề của tôi (?) là tôi đã phẫu thuật dạ dày nên tôi không thể ăn nhiều. Thông thường ở Úc, vợ chồng tôi gọi một suất ăn để chia nhau, nhưng nếu tôi muốn món gì mà anh ấy không ăn được hoặc không thích, tôi sẽ gọi suất ăn của mình và mang phần thừa về nhà hâm nóng lại sau. Điều đó sẽ hơi khó khăn khi tôi cố gắng ăn càng nhiều loại thức ăn Việt Nam càng tốt.
 ​
 Gọi nguyên một suất ăn cho mình mà để lại nhiều thức ăn thừa thì có phản cảm hay “xấu” không? Tôi rất muốn chúng ta gọi 2 phở khác nhau và được trải nghiệm cả hai nhưng không ăn hết có phải là một điều tồi tệ không?
 Mọi lời khuyên về cách giải thích/xin lỗi về khả năng ăn uống hạn chế của tôi sẽ được đón nhận!!!! LÀM ƠN!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been in Vietnam the past month (& loved it btw, I fell in love after visiting Ninh Binh) - 2 weeks in Hanoi & the last 2 in Da Nang. 
 Everywhere I go, people constantly stare at me & when I do go into shops, I’ve been told I look Vietnamese. This happens when I speak english to them. I say thank you when I hear them, cause tbh Vietnamese women are beautiful & also didn’t know what to say in response. 
 Honestly, I’m not sure if I’m thinking too much into it but just wanted to know what it means? 
 I’m not Vietnamese (obviously lolol), just a traveler from another SEA country.
 Edit to add: I’m a female & motorcyclists stare at me while driving past. not sure if they’re just being creeps

We've been following the advice of only using Mai Linh / Vinasun or just walking, but a man at the rank queue guided us to a Saigon Tourist taxi at the queue. I thought he was the official taxi rank guide, but looking back obviously he was a partner / part of this particular taxi company.
 Taxi driver was chatty and had fairly good English, asking us about our home country.
 First issue was the exit toll - didn't realise there was one - he said we had to pay it, pointing to a sign on his sun visor. I asked how much and he wouldn't properly say, then as I looked in my wallet he reached over and grabbed it, went through the notes saying there were lots of big ones, and pulled one out. I really thought it was a 100k bill (but can't be sure) …]]></summary>

My usual dive sites Phu Quoc and Nha Trang don’t seem to have any caves to the best of my knowledge and no dive shop I’ve checked offers either cavern or cave training. 
 Has anyone got any ideas? I’m kind of stumped and even when I’ve asked in Vietnamese language scuba groups nobody seems to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I plan to visit Vietnam, Da Nang around the end of January, 2023. I'm little bit concerned about Typhoons as in my home country we do not have anything relatively extreme. I read on news that Da Nang experienced Typhoon Noru - saw the videos, images and heard that there was an evacuation in thousands, so got scared a bit and thinking - maybe just go back to EU and sip beers there without worrying too much, haha. 
 I do plan to stay there for a month or two as DN. Anyone who have been there and can give any pro-tips about that place, please let me know down below. 
 Cheers

 What are some good spots or activities to meet other tourists/backpackers/expat/etc?
 I saw a pub crawl and a couch surfing event but they are both on Saturday and I can't find anything on meetup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My partner and I (Europeans) are traveling through VN while working remote. We did some research and asked our friends about their experiences and recommendations on this country.
 One couple in particular was very enthousiast about Da Nang. Said they could live there. Also, we read Da Nang is #3 hot spots in SeA. Based on these findings and recommendations, we booked ourself a good amount of time here.
 After spending 5 days in HCMC - which we really enjoyed - the experiences here in Da Nang didn’t really meet our expectations. We’re staying in the beach area, went to the city center, did Hai Van Pass & Ba Na Hills.
 We’re very curious about the history of this city. It feels like there’s put a lot of money into it years ago, but not very well maintained. Also they’re still building A LOT, while other properties seem unfinished.
 Is this city build to be Asias Dubai/Barcelona/Rio/Miami (since it has a beach)?
 We’re also looking for recommendations on what to do/see/eat here :)

 Use the other hand to clean butthole as well or does the gun itself is sufficient? How do you know? 
 How do you dry yourself off? Toilet paper of course but what if there's no TP? 
 Do you flush first then use gun or flush after?
 How do you deal with water splashes on toilet seat?
 Tricks/tips from your master of this subject is greatly appreciated!
 Edit: I've never use it before in the US and I've been here couple weeks. Sure it's not rocket science to use it, just interest on how people optimize the use of it. I'm sure there's a preferred method for a guy vs girl. 
 For me as a guy,since my junk, I lean forward and spray from the back. I tried spray only and use TP to check, sometimes it's clean and sometimes not. So I've use my left hand then with TP ready, wipe dry. This is where if you had a sink on top of the tank like some Japan toilet, you can wash your hands while sitting.

 Have been here a couple weeks and been eating local cuisine; it’s delicious but I find that it doesn’t really agree with me. I’ll spare the details but let’s just say I have an upset stomach.
 What do you make that’s similar to back home and where do you purchase it?
 I plan to continue eating local occasionally, but on a daily basis I need something similar to what we have back home.
 Thanks!

 So before arrival I had purchased a 30 day e visa from the official government website and printed this out. (90 day visa are not available). 
 We flew from Bangkok to Hanoi. At the airport in Bangkok the check in desk didn't ask to see proof of visa and I was told we would be permited 15 days as standard. Upon arrival into Hanoi immigration didn't ask for my visa yet stamped our passports for 30 days. Maybe they could see on their system we had purchased an e visa?

Sau một thời gian nói chuyện với tụi nó thì rút ra kết luận là kĩ năng nghe nói của mình quá kém T^T, nhất là khi nói chuyện với đứa UK và Úc. Không chỉ accent khác mà cách tụi nó đặt câu cũng khác quắc. Thí dụ khi gặp nhau UK hay hỏi "Have you done much today?" Lúc đầu mình nghe hổng ra cứ phải nghệt mặt ra hỏi lại, giờ nghe quen thì chỉ cần nó nói much là bắt bài được liền =)) nhưng vẫn là nghe được 50% của nó thôi không nghe ra được hết. Mình để ý cách tụi nó đặt câu hỏi và trả lời, và với cách mình được học cũng khác nữa, nhiều khi mình hỏi mà tụi nó không hiểu, nên thành ra ông gà bà vịt :))) để luyện tập thêm thì bên cạnh nói nhiều với tụi nó thì mình cũng coi show, program và để ý các nhân vật đối thoại rồi nhại theo, chứ cũng không biết còn cách nào khác không. Đặc biệt là nhiều khi muốn join conversation của tụi nó mà ko được cứ thấy vấp váp kiểu gì. Nói được 1 2 câu là ngưng nhảy số rồi. Mình muốn hỏi các bạn đã luyện kĩ năng nghe nói như nào vậy? Mình có tìm hiểu thì biết phải luyện theo intonation, schwa, diction. Các bạn luyện theo những phương pháp này thấy ổn hông? speaking của mình lúc trước cũng ko tệ lắm, 7.0 nhưng thấy cũng còn loay hoay quá. Hoan nghênh mọi ý kiến đóng góp. Any advice would help!

 I'm interested in getting a better understanding of Vietnamese humor. What are some of your favorite funny shows or movies in Vietnamese? Preferably ones with English subtitles (but I know that's probably much rarer), as I am still learning Vietnamese and am not very good. The only movie on Netflix they had was Dreamy Eyes (Mất Biếc) which was a pretty good love story, but not a comedy.
 In no way am I making an assumption based on the tiny sample size of the shows available on Netflix, but is comedy less popular in Vietnam as a form of entertainment? I've also tried searching online other places besides Netflix and don't find much stuff about Vietnamese comedy. So what are some of your favorites you could recommend?

 Any tips for this?? And is there a difference between aluminum and stainless steel phin? I bought the cheap 20-40,000 VND aluminum ones from the robusta coffee beans shop and it really doesn’t fit well. Hence, once I reach home, I bought the stainless steel one for about 80,000 VND and shipped it to my country.
 I was in a cafe and heard a song I really like but couldn’t capture the song name in time. When I reached home, I randomly searched for top Vietnam song and found “Sai gon Dau long qua”.
 What does it mean?

 I've been looking for a pair of eyeglass frames that were discontinued in the US, and for some reason, they're readily available in Vietnam. I'd like to order them from one of the websites where I found them, but I need a parcel forwarding service with shopping assistance. Does such a thing exist in Vietnam?

At first I though, well maybe people can't afford the respiratory, but a dust mask would still be useful for concrete dust and affordable. One could even wash and reuse them.
 Concrete dust is a pretty hazardous material to breath in. Perhaps there is less education on that? As I didn't actually know myself the first time I used it.
 Then of course the traffic is pretty aggressive and I understand the collision rate is rather high.
 So it just seems like safety isn't a top concern. Which is a shame because life is precious, IMO.

 I am currently studying International Business in Asia course at Homeschool Rotterdam and I have a current project in which I need to determine consumer profiles in the Vietnamese fruit market. Thus, I am required to investigate this matter through field research.
 However, I don't know anyone in Vietnam and was wondering if you could help me fill out a survey that I need to have filled in by at least 100 Vietnamese people.
 The survey consists of 30 questions and it should not take longer than 10 minutes to complete. All data received will be used for study purposes only and will be kept strictly confidential. Furthermore, you will remain anonymous without having to enlist your name, email address, or other personal information.
 Would it be okay to post the link here on reddit, or would I get flagged for potential scam / fraud?

But there are channels from Vietnam with very sizeable English speaking audience. Among which like woodworking, art, and very cool stuff that showcase the traditional underrated Vietnamese skilset. In the last 2 or 3 years, there are these subsets of fake videos that usually from South East Asia (in which Vietnam included). It does followed the trend of popular western video already. Such as, people go out in the wood and making stuffs with very primitive skillset. And then because the initial videos were so successful, a bunch of fake videos prop up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Just returned from Vietnam. My itinerary was roughly 4 days in tp HCM, 10 days up North in various places, then another 7 days back in HCM.
 I found that Hanoi was really active. Full of tourists, full of fun things happening. And most importantly, hotel accommodation was reasonably priced. Managed to get a good sized room with a balcony, at a good hotel, for around 650.000 in Hoàn Kiếm area, not five minutes walk from the lake. 
 By comparison, on my second stay in Saigon, best I could get was a passable room in a really cramped hotel with paper thin walls, for about 1000.000/n. I did scour Agoda and Booking.com for better deals, but there weren't many to be found. 
 And this despite there being very few tourists there (for some reason). That being the case, you'd think supply would exceed demand, and you'd get hotels dropping their prices in order to compete. 
 Another example: In my first 4 day stint in Saigon, I got a nice room with a balcony, in a nice but slightly run down hotel on Để Thám, for around 835.000. I would have booked them for my second stay too, but for some reason, they decided to double the price after I left. 
 I'm not whining. Just really puzzled by the economics of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you know anyone or has personal experience with anyone who illegally emigrated to another country in the last 15 - 20 years? No, I am not talking about people who fled as refugees. I am talking about people who intentionally overstay (permanently) their (tourist or student) visa in a foreign country.
 I have a relative who is considering this and work as a nail technician (in my opinion very bad route) and I would like to hear real stories or experience of people who have done it before.
 My main concerns and what I have told my relative are:
  
It's illegal and you are breaking the law (duh)
 You will have to pay a huge up front fee for this illegal service ($100k USD).
 You won't be able to work legally. Working illegally means terrible working condition and pay. It might take 7 - 10 years just to repay the fee + interests.
 You won't have life in these 7 - 10 years since you are trying to save every penny.
 You won't be able to return to Vietnam any time soon since you don't have legal documents.
  
Also, what is the best way to report this illegal activity to the authority (Vietnam or foreign country) without implicating my relative (financially or criminally)?

 I am looking for a Vietnam Solidarity Tours- aka supporting the Vietnamese people based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty - pro socialism / Communism - and no outside interference from other nations or religions.
 The tour focus in Hanoi and on the Vietnamese war from their side - not the outside world or USA and if possible to meet and show solidarity for the Vietnamese Society/people.

 Best I've seen so far on the internet is taking a minibus from Thanh Hoa to Sam Neua which is near Vieng Xai but curious if anyone has either 1) a better suggestion of getting near there from Hanoi directly since otherwise I would not visit Thanh Hoa or 2) something a bit more comfortable, since the bus from Thanh Hoa seems to be a cramped minivan with passengers shoved in with all sorts of produce/local goods and overall an uncomfortable ride compared to the great coach busses in Vietnam. Thank you!

 I refused to buy phin from those streets stall fearing they might not be authentic. So, I purchased 2 phin from 2 different shops that I bought beans from. Both same size, Aluminum , but cost 40,000 & 20,000 VND. But both brands are trungyen. I am okay cause both are super cheap hence I. Didn’t think. Much. 
 When I reach home, I couldn’t fit the filter press into the chamber covering the grounds properly and found out that the ones I bought are too cheap to be authentic.
 I just wanna ask the Vietnamese here which are the actual? Is there an actual one? Is it made of stainless steel? Or there is nothing wrong with my aluminum cheap phin and it’s meant to be like that and all I have to do is to just sand paper it down ?

 I am visiting Hanoi and was curious about a few things. I wondered if I could ask .. (apologies if any of these questions seem ignorant, I do not mean them to be).
  
I see there are people, usually men in different uniforms .. there are the green which is military I think, but also yellow and then a darker green which seems to be older men? What are the different uniforms?
 
Are the water puppets perceived as very touristy, or is it something Vietnamese people see / enjoy also? Is it a true tradition? The crowd was almost entirely Western so I wasn't sure.
 
When police drive through the streets saying things on the loudspeaker, what are they saying? People seem to move their mopeds but I wasn't sure.
 
Is there any significance to the sunflower seeds people eat, or is it just a nice snack at the bar / restaurant?
 
How are tourists perceived in Hanoi? Do people (generally) have any anti-American or anti-Western sentiment? If so, is it generational?
 
What are the attitudes of young Vietnamese people to the military? I know there is conscription but also it is relatively easy to get out of (?). Is military service considered a good or useful thing generally?
 
Are the schools inside the city e.g. Old or French Quarter for rich people or are they local schools for everyone in the area?
 
What might locals think about visitors' attempts to cross the road? Are tourists a nuisance on the streets?
 
 Apologies if any weird questions, just things I was curious about wandering around.

 This title have made it way to exert a strong influence in Vietnamese schools from when I was young, where talented kids in our classes will be refered as Trạng Nguyên nhí (little Trạng Nguyên, which reflects their talent at a young age) . 
 Though people no longer have these tests to make people becoming Trạng Nguyên anymore, I still really like how prestigious the title is, as it proves your talent and achievement as a scholar. It also brings a sense of nostalgia about the traditional culture of Vietnam as well.
 What are your opinions about the Trạng Nguyên culture of ancient Vietnam? Feel free to let me know in both English or Vietnamese!

 Russia is in for a bad day. Even if NATO doesnt trigger Article 5, expect some level of retaliation from NATO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my partner are traveling through Vietnam rn and went to the War Remnants Museum this week. I learned about Agent Orange and it has been worried me sick since then. I just can’t shake off the feeling that I’m being exposed to the dioxin. Even though it’s 50yrs ago, it’s not like dioxin has an expiration date.
 If it’s still in the soil, how does it NOT affect the (tap) water, fruits, plants and animals? For example: if tap water comes from rain, the rain first goes through the infected soil and is pretty much untreated (doesn’t really smell like chlorine). People here also say it’s safe to drink boiled tap water and I guess they make pho’s and coffee with it. But how about heavy metals like lead?
 We’re flying to Danang today and just the feeling of walking around that airport where that stuff was at 50yrs ago stresses me out.
 Am I overthinking it or is my stress legit?
 I feel so bad for the locals that this happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are into stuff like...
  
Experiencing culture (special events, traditions, temples, local food)
 Pretty nature (beaches, mountains, forests)
 Fun/interesting experiences (for example animal parks, outdoor spas, museums, diving, walking/exploring, cooking class, kayaking, cultural festivals, night markets)
 Food (especially Asian and seafood)
 Chilling
 "Special" charming places that aren't completely overtaken by tourists
  
(Extra info if relevant: We will fly from Frankfurt Germany. Budget-wise we imagine spending about 3k Eur every month including food, but that's really flexible. We'll be taking 1 week's holiday each month and WFH for the rest of the time wherever we are, but only for 5-6 hours a day.)
 I also want to ask: Does it make the most sense to fly in and out of Thailand?
 Thanks a lot in advance.

How do they know about this relatively niche and somewhat uncommon British phrase? My guess is that the TV show "Only Fools and Horses" was aired in Vietnam in the past, the phrase is used on that show.
 Help me solve this perplexing occurrence, thank you

We arrived at 18:30 and our E-Visa was still in Process. We had to enter using our German Passport which granted us a stay for 14 Days. We now have to leave vietnam on the 28.11.2022.
 We already have a flight from hanoi to chiang Mai on the 05.12.2022, so we would overstay for 7 Days. 
 Now we dont know what to do. Should we do a visa run? Should we try to extend our visa? -> we already went to a Immigration office in which they told us we cant extend our visa so we have to pay a fine at the airport for our overstay in Hanoi on the 05.12.2022. Or should we just book a new flight out of vietnam before the 28.11… 
 I hope you guys can help us out.
 Cheers :)

 For my visit to Vietnam, I am looking for beachfront resorts (or homes if resorts are not available) in places close to cities with airports (apart from Da Nang). The dates are between 26th November and 6th December. Budget can be up to 75 USD (or 1850000 VND) per night but the lower, the better. Quiet, serene places with good food options are preferred.
 I checked AirBnBs, booking.com, other such sites and didn't find many options. If any of you know have stayed at places like this or know of them, please drop a comment here. Would appreciate it a lot :)
 Thanks

I have some ideas on what to visit but I have not planned anything in details, the only thing that I know is that I would like to explore nice hiking places and do outdoor activities. I should spend some time both in South Vietnam and the north. 
 Is it easy to find decent outdoor clothes? Here in Europe, there are shops like Decathlon that sell decent clothes at a decent price for outdoor activities. What are the similar shops in HCMC? Does it make sense to buy the clothes that I need there rather than bring a lot of clothes with me?

I work in a bar, and a few gentlemen from Vietnam came to visit my city for business. All of them ordered coffe and sat down. Each and every one dipped their cigarettes into the coffe before smoking it, the filter I mean. So my question is, is this a cultural thing in Vietnam? I tried asking them but we couldn't understand each other well. Do any of you know the answer to this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am an American man planning to move to Vietnam to teach English. I'm almost finished with my TEFL course and plan to visit Vietnam soon after. I'm so excited and have so many questions, but first, I want to ask about this topic which I have seen come up quite often when doing my research about Vietnam.
 Somebody posted an article here a few days ago about culture shocks when traveling to Vietnam, and one of the first things on the list mentioned that it's common to see men publicly physically assault their wives.
 I have been doing a lot of research about Vietnam, and while I love almost every other aspect about it, this topic has arisen so many times that I feel the need to ask you people who live there and have been there before. So many articles mention that you will see men hit their wives and as long as you don't interfere, you will be fine, etc. This really concerns me because of some instances of seeing this in my childhood that really bothered me, so I am really worried about seeing this in Vietnam.
 How common is it really? I plan to travel to the major cities like Hanoi and HCMC. Is it actually a super common thing to hear and see domestic violence? It really makes me anxious thinking about having to see and hear this and not be able to help. 
 I guess I get triggered when I hear or see domestic violence and am wondering if it's something that I am likely to be forced to witness on a regular basis in Vietnam.

So far, there has been no precedent for intentionally deceptive mishaps in the Vietnamese banking system, and the notion that "the bank is the safest place" has become inherently ingrained in the minds of ordinary citizens. Because of that belief, we are now in danger of losing all of our assets, which we have worked for years to acquire. Furthermore, by posting too few warning signs and withholding information about these bonds, people like us were unaware of things that should have been legally displayed to us. Let us explain how the situation unfolded. 
 Our goal when visiting SCB Bank is to deposit money into savings accounts, many of which are held by long-term clients. However, SCB's bank clerks introduced…]]></summary>

 Vào tháng 1 năm nay, cô đã chinh phục thành công khối núi Vinson, đứng ở độ cao 4.892 mét, là đỉnh núi cao nhất ở Nam Cực. Thật khó khăn cho cô khi vừa leo dốc trong thời tiết khắc nghiệt vừa mang theo một gói 70 lít.
 Nhã và nhóm leo núi của cô ấy quay trở lại Everest Base Camp ngay khi lên đến đỉnh.
 Theo danh sách mới nhất của The Himalayan Database, tính đến tháng 12/2021, mới chỉ có 3 người đàn ông Việt Nam chinh phục đỉnh Everest thành công.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After doing northern vietnam i’m looking to go down all the way to the south, and i’m wondering how to travel between these places. 
 From Ninh Binh to Hue by car is 11 hours, so i’m guessing maybe taking a plane would be best, or sleeper bus. There probably isn’t an airport in Ninh Binh so I might have to go back to Hanoi if flying is the best option.
 Hue to Nha Trang is also 11 hours by car, so maybe plane or sleeper bus again. I was considering doing the Hi Van Pass maybe from hue to Da Nang, if it would be easier to get from Da Nang to Nha Trang.
 Nha Trang to Phan Thiet by car is 4 hours, so idk about that one.
 HCMC to Phan Thiet is also 4 hours.
 If anyone has done a similar route before, please share how you traveled between these places and any other tips
 Also, if you have any other recommendations for places near the ones I have mentioned, or if you recommend skipping a city feel free to share:)
 Thanks!

Locals, what are some book recommendations that I need to read before I go? I’m not looking for a travel book. Anything that is historical and gives me a good sense of the complex history. Historical fiction and/or or nonfiction. Thanks!

The food, the art, the culture, and the seemingly endless ebb and flow of motorbikes in and around the major cities. What always sticks out the most is the absolute tenacity of Vietnams people. They are "get it done" type people, which I have the utmost respect for. Vietnam has some of the most stunning landscapes you can witness from the northern Ha Giang mountains to southern mighty Mekong. Partnered by ever changing food dishes curated by the different distinct cultures. This place is somewhere I long to call home one day. Thank you for everything, and until next time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there. As a young Vietnamese, I generally just don't care about what language they're singing. I believe that artists should convey their music in any way in which they feel the most comfortable. But the idea of having Vietnamese artists that mostly sing in English or have an English stage name is so frowned upon in Vietnam and many would be called "sính ngoại" or "anglocentric". I'm curious and would love to hear more about your opinions on this topic.

 I was suppose to do a 21days trip but decided to cut short to 19days because I was really tired traveling. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my post covid trip.
 • 5days in DN/Hoi an. • Hai van pass to Hue. I love it. • 1.5days hue. • 2.5days Ninh Binh & I love it. • 2days Hanoi. Crowded and busy but pho was great. • 3days Sapa. Hike up Fansipan was the best choice. Family dinner was simply great • 2D1N Ha Giang Loop was the best. • 2days back to Hanoi to rest. (Could have done Cat Ba island, or hai phong, or squeeze in Phong Nha, but right now, I am so really tired. I need to go home right now))))
 Thank u still guys :)))

I have a problem digesting food due to an issue with my pancreas. Thus I need to eat mainly low fat, healthy food.
 Here comes my questions:- 1. Vietnamese food seems super healthy, and especially so in North Vietnam, where I read the diet is more simple. Would you agree? Cooking with too much oil is a killer for me, deep fried is a definite no and I generally avoid red meat.
  
I will have to bring medication with me (enzymes) as I need these when I eat. Has anyone been able to bring a prescription from abroad and use it in Vietnam? I live in Netherlands, Europe btw. I’d like to be organized with this in case I want to stay on longer. I have 6 months off from January.
 
I’d like to do some kind of agri tourism while there, perhaps where food is grown and to be a part of this. I’d love to learn more about growing grains and plants, and it would be nice to involve with a community.
 
Staying fit is super important to me, so I’d love to join a gym over there for a month, is this easy? My gut is telling me Hanoi is a good place for me to be for a while. Also I love to bike, is it common to cycle around Vietnam?
 
 Thanks for your help!

Driving a motorbike without a license
 Breaking simple traffic rules (crossing a solid line etc)
 Running a red light
  
I'm guessing it would probably run from 200K for 2, 400K for 3 and maybe 1 million for 1, would that be about correct?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Two Americans here - first trip to Vietnam in February for two weeks!
 We’ve been on other trips to SE Asia - Thailand 2X, Malaysia, Singapore.
 We’ll spend 4 nights in Hanoi, 3 nights in Cam Ranh, and 5 nights in HCMC (last night is to depart, so really 4). 
 My question is - what is something that could be surprising or different from other places in Asia we’ve been? Any general tips specific to Vietnam? 
 If you have any Old Quarter Hanoi or District 1 HCMC street food we should get - would love to hear that too! 
 SO excited to finally be able to do this trip - we put it on hold for a long time with the pandemic!

 I was wondering if I can put several mason jars wrapped in bubble wrap in my checked luggage. The jars are 2 sizes, 1 qt and 1 pint. The contents of the jars are; pepper relish, pear relish, jelly, hot sauce, salsa, tomato sauce, BBQ sauce, pickles. 
 I found this site, but it's really confusing and I'm not even sure it's where i need to be looking because it's a US document.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have any recommendations for a service (iOS app) that allows you to subscribe to a Vietnamese number that can send and receive SMS? I am not a fan of the SIM swapping as it's disruptive to 99% of what I need to do when here (work).
 In prior countries, I've used Burner, Hushed, or Flyp as phone services that allow me to subscribe monthly (or annually) to have a dedicated local number. I can send and receive SMS messages with locals through the app.
 When I connect with people here and give out my number (American) if they're iOS it is fine since we can iMessage. But most are not iOS therefore they are hesitant to text (or some can't) because of the international number.
 I know there are alternative apps like WhatsApp and such. I use Signal only, as I don't like WhatsApp, however some of the people I connect with aren't going to do Signal (not tech savvy, not interested in it, etc..).
 I'm fine paying for the service. Our VOIP provider for work doesn't offer any Vietnamese VOIP numbers, just a company assigned SIM, so I was hoping to find an alternative. I welcome any input.

 I want to check my booking with VietJetAir from BKK to Saigon via https://th.vietjetair.com/searchreservation.
 But if I enter the details of my booking I get the message "Sorry, we are only able to support Thai currency booking at the moment."
 What does that even mean and how can I access my booking?
 Interesting observation: If I replace the last letter of my reservation number with something else the site responds with "There is no flight information match, please re-check input value"
 That means with the correct number they found my booking. 
 Any ideas?
 Thanks

This isn't uncommon while traveling, many people ask for photos because I'm a foreigner with bright blonde hair. I posed smiling in the photo as his friend snapped the pic, and then his friend wanted one too, so I took a selfie with him. Besides these two men, maybe 3-4 women around the same age were with them.

My partner and I are visiting Vietnam and staying in one place for a month (Slow traveling, need a mini-vacation from switching up places so often). We're not super crazy about the idea of being in a city and want to stay on the outskirts (near a beach would be ideal) of a city. We are deciding between Hanoi and Hoi An and would love some advice on things like cost, food (we're vegetarian), and overall advice. 
 Since it's a month, we want to be near a city/civilization. If you have any other beautiful natural places that are relaxation friendly in Vietnam, I'd be more than happy to hear ideas! We also will be there for December and would love a swim hole if the waves are too choppy in the ocean.

 I would like to do the hike over 2 days, camping half way and reaching the summit early in the morning the second day. I can see there are a lot of companies offering the tour but I’m not sure how to pick one. I would strongly prefer to use a tour company which is local to the region / pays local guides fairly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm looking for some advice regarding my 27 day trip to Vietnam in January. 
 I am thinking of doing the day 3 loop of Ha Giang in the first week of January at the beginning of my trip, but I've also heard it can be very cold and possibly snowing, as well as foggy. Would it still be worth it to make the trip during this time, or should I skip it?
 What kind of clothes should I bring if I do decide to make the trip? I want to make the most out of my trip while enjoying it, and as it would be one of my first stops on my trip, it could set the tone of the rest of my trip. 
 ​
 Really looking forward to this trip! Also, would love to hear any other off the beaten path suggestions of where to visit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for something that my dad and I (while in Vietnam) drive mainly, but ideally my mom (50s) can too. She already has an electric bike and doesn't really use it much. The scooter cant be too heavy and should have decent storage. Something that looks like a vespa is what I have in mind, but I'm open to anything, both electric and gas recommendation. Much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I have been to Vietnam 5 times now but have yet to do the Ha Giang loop. I'd like to leave the USA in february to dodge part of the winter and go back to Viet to ride the loop. I remember that Hanoi was quite cold and rainy when I was there in January and I'd prefer to ride the loop when weather conditions are optimal. Is February too early to ride Ha Giang Loop? I can wait until early march if I must but going early february is preferred if conditions are similar. I am getting conflicting information as a I read articles about it. 
 Btw I am experienced with riding a motorbike in viet countryside and am aware of issues with trucks and busses. Im guessing that I wont have problems with riding Ha Giang. I was thinking of a Honda Wave semi-Auto. It was reliable last time I did a trip around Vietnam and Im not practiced on manuals. Like many others, I am not going to be riding this legally. Im aware of the risks but just like last time I went to Vietnam, I gotta do what I gotta do.

The trip was extremely spontaneous as I booked my ticket on Sunday evening, and I applied for my visa Monday morning. It says it takes 3 days to process and tomorrow morning will mark day 2. Im concerned I won’t have it before my flight in a couple days, does anyone know a way to get an expedited Visa? Any advice would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, my girlfriend and I are spending the next 4 months in Vietnam. We fly into HCM and plan on travelling the Deep South - Mekong Delta onto Phu Quoc.
 We have estimated on spending 20-30 days in this region and are wondering if this may be too long? We are also considering exploring the delta on motorbikes (is this worth while for the time spent there?).If so would anyone have experience or routes biking the delta/south. We mainly found 1/2 day trips online about the delta, and haven’t found much on longer self planned stays.
 As far the places entail (suggestions welcome!)
  
My Tho
 
Ben Tre
 
Tra Vinh
 
Vinh Long
 
Can Tho
 
Sa Dec
 
Cao Lanh
 
Long Xuyen
 
Chau Doc
 
Ha Tien
 
Phu Quoc
 
 Any advice would be hugely appreciated :)

 I am in the lift, it arrives at my floor, the doors open, and people rush in before I could get out.
 Go for health check. Come early to avoid the crowd. The doors open, again everyone just rushes in and put their paper first. Then others come lift the pile of papers and put their under I hope that the person working there will flip the pile.
 Someone on a motorbike arrive at an intersection, wants to turn left,but there is traffic so can't turn directly,so just start driving on the incoming traffic until they can final cross. Instead of waiting at the intersection.
 It is lunch time,some parents come to pick up their children, there aren't many people, just 2 or 3 bikes. And still, they find the way to park right in front of the gate.

 The plan for a HSR line running across the country was authorized in 2021. Originally planned to be a 350kph/220mph-ish line, the 2022 version calls for a designed speed of 250kph/155mph and an operating speed of 180-225kph, or 111-140mph. The construction will take place from 2025 to 2041 in three phases, a nine-year reduction compared to the original plan. It will utilize electric multiple units as the rolling stock, with both passenger and freight versions running on double-track standard gauge (1435mm) rail, as opposed to the existing narrow gauge (1067mm). 
 The line will be 1508km/937mi long, consisting of ~70 stations. The annual estimated figures for passenger and freight is 163M and 65M metric tons, respectively, with 142 pairs of passenger and 128 pairs of freight train running daily. The first phase (2025-2031) will comprise of a 361km/224mi line connecting Thu Thiem (HCM City) to Nha Trang. Following this, a line from Hanoi to Da Nang will be constructed from 2031 to 2038. The final phase (2038-2041) will involve connecting Nha Trang and Da Nang. Roughly $61.7B will be spent, with the majority (63%) coming from land acquisitions and auctions. 22% will come from state-funded sources, with private funding expected to be about 15% of the total budget.

 For example the Sun Group’s primavera village in Phu Quoc is id say 80% complete, what will the plans be? For tourists to live and stay in the town?
 Super intrigued by it all!

She understands basic things but I'd like her to have a better understanding of what are we treating here and what are the implications and perspective. I could use a google translator but given the circumstances I don't want anything to be misinterpreted or lost in translation. Could anyone please help me with the translation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've tried looking for past post about good massage parlors and they seem to be outdated (~3 years ago)
 Since Vietnam is slowly reopening due to COVID, I'm wondering if there are any good massages around Hanoi. Especially near the Old Quarter and Ho Tay. For both locals and tourist (specially those that can speak English)
 My wife was raised and born in Hanoi for 20+ years and haven't been back for 10 years. We don't mind going to a massage parlor that only speaks Vietnamese since she can translate and my Vietnamese is at an elementary level for an American.

 Any suggestions about the joints/ restaurants to check out would be appreciated, along with the regional dishes to try. I understand a lot of Vietnamese food is street food so if you guys even recommend the streets/ markets to go to in these cities to sample the local fare, would love that. 
 Specially looking to try as much coffee, noodles, rolls as I can!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I am currently travelling through Vietnam. 2 days ago while on Cat Ba island as I was biking, a dog came up to me and seemed friendly. He played around for a bit and ‘teethed’ (place his teeth on but not bite) my hand. He also lightly scratched me (left a mark for 5 minutes before disappearing). Does anyone know if there is rabies on Cat Ba Island? And also does anyone know if the situation I described is enough to transmit rabies? I’m currently heading to Ha Giang so will be away from any vaccination clinic. But it is now a massive worry, as I thought Rabies is evident with aggressive or erratic behaviour.

 But prior to that, I have been asked to prepare an assignment on Agriculture-based industries in Vietnam. I have gone through a few articles and videos on the internet, but it would have been really great if I could receive some insights and sources from locals there.

 I had a long discussion about usage of "em" with a Vnmese girl and I felt that there seems to be some inconsistencies between what she said and what I had learnt so far.
 Perhaps there are some nuances of the Vnmese language / grammar that I am missing, so I just want to check with Vietnamese speakers here... cam on rat nhieu
 For context, I'm the older guy here.
 For so many months, I have addressed the girl as,
 - Hey/morning/goodnight em
 - em ngu ngon / em ngu ngon nha
 - Her name + em
 And there were no complaints from her. Sometimes it even seemed that she liked it.
 Then suddenly a couple days ago, she asked me not to call her "em", as she feels that it's impolite.
 She explained that addressing Vnmese people is a complex matter and that I have been using it the wrong way …]]></summary>

I have heard about floods during the month of November but would they happen in December too? What are the chances? And which areas might be affected if there are floods in December (first week)?
 I have two options. 1. Visit Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue from 28th November to 2nd December OR 2. Visit Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue from 2nd December to 6th December
 Which would you suggest? 
 Appreciate your help a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I speculated an alternate lore (short) where North Vietnam instantly invaded (or special military campaign" in Laos to weaken the Western-dominated "American" alliance influence in Southeast Asia. Had Pathet Laos toppled the corrupted Vientiane government either in 1963 or 1964, then South Vietnam faced a peril where the newly communist Laos government planned to infiltrate Central Vietnam (South Vietnam) to prevent largely American forces gained on foothold across Central Highlands.
 Another POD is both Vietnams divided at the 16th Parallel (leaving Da Nang and southern branch of Thu Bon River under North Vietnam side). It would create massive chaos in Laos where communist North Vietnam easily determined to aid Pathet Laos to "liberate" Vientiane around early 1964 or 1965 (or even before 1968 Tet Offensive) depending on American military moodiness. North Vietnamese General Giap would like to see the size of NVA forces to orchestrate the moderately launched assaults of several Laotian towns and villages near the Vietnam-Laos border.
 With Laos under a "socialist" Vietnamese client state (regardless if Vietnam divided in 17th Parallel as per OTL or alternatively divided at 16th parallel), South Vietnam could faced intensified harassment from largely local "VC" communist forces near the South Vietnam-Laos border and even near provincial capitals in Central Highlands. This would lead the American government to seek peace talks with North Vietnam and Soviet Union secretly in a third country. If successful peace talks in mid-1960s, American could be saved up to 30,000 American soldiers and even save largely funds to fight against poverty in the domestic U.S. I generalized a possibly no Nixon as President of U.S in 1969.
 Can you think about ideas that devastated South Vietnam?

We have done HaLong Bay already so this time we are thinking about Lan Ha Bay. I think it makes sense to fly into Cat Bai Airport (HPH) and do a 3 day night night cruise. And then bus back to Hanoi. 
 Should we stay in Haiphong for a night before cruise?
 There are so many cruise options, does anyone have a preferred option? We are obviously going for the honeymoon vibe. 
 Some options we are seeing for cruise include:
 Ylang by Heritage Cruise Line
 Perla Dawn Sails
 V’Spirit Premier Cruise

 I will shortly be traveling to VN for the first time. I read a lot about taxis scamming you with prices. Also when renting bikes / scooters there are people with vests charging fake fees when in fact a free parking spot is just down the road. I read to just ignore them but I‘m easily „intimidated“ as I don‘t want to get in trouble especially in a foreign country plus I’m traveling with children. How do I best deal with these situations?

 Any recommendations for a tailor that could get me a good suit for between 200-300 euro (or is this an unrealistic price range?) My girlfriend would be looking at getting a dress aswell but wouldn't be dropping as much money on that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an American living in Saigon (for over 3 years now) and my wife is Vietnamese, born and raised in central VN.
 Lately we talked about moving out of Vietnam to somewhere more permanent. I love Southeast Asia and want to stay, but Saigon has ridiculous real estate pricing and interest rates on house loans. Also, crazy pricing for international schools, crazy traffic etc. So I've done some research and see many foreigners who moved to Malaysia and they seem to really love it. KL/Penang seem very developed with good public transportation, great real estate pricing even for luxury places, good mortgage rates, good tax situation for digital nomads, and international schools are cheap. Overall it seems like a clear upgrade over many aspects of Saigon (don't hate me for saying this, I honestly don't know, just read online).
 For some reason though my wife is not down with this idea. She doesn't like Malaysia and the culture there. I'm wondering what other Vietnamese people think of Malaysia and Malaysian culture? If you ever visited or lived there, what did you find hard to adjust to? What did you like or not like? 
 I'd love to hear your opinions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the current debate surrounding Affirmative Action, many people evoke "the poor Vietnamese who are uneducated and therefore need affirmative action". First off, most schools don't consider the difference between South East Asians and East Asians. Secondly, statistics paint a different picture. Look at this table from Pew Research:

 As you can see, Vietnamese born abroad, that is, the refugees, have low educational attainment. But for the generation that was born here, educational attainment is higher than whites. This, of course, contradicts the liberal narrative that Asians are doing better because of higher socio-economic status. Yes, they are correct -- many Vietnamese came to the US poor and without much education. But their children perform better than white Americans.

 So, pro-affirmative action advocates, stop using the Vietnamese as your token Asian minority to disguise your Asian racism. If you dig into the data, you might not like what you see.

Surely there are low-key strip clubs/girly-bars available under the radar, but why is Vietnam so conservative in this domain? Also, plenty of clubs in Mongolia (UB) and even majority-muslim Indonesia. 
 After living here for almost 4 years it's a little disappointing to not have ready access to a girly-bar, but I of course don't know why. What do you think Reddit?

I came across something online that said Vietnam has 52 tribes, and that most are in north Vietnam. That seems like A LOT for such a small place. I can google and find stuff on my own but I'm asking just in case someone might know some great material that I can read. It can be in Vietnamese. I can use Google Translate to translate the text. Thank you!
 I love this food YT channel based in Vietnam for going to visit the tribes around the world. This one is in Vietnam but I didn't catch which tribe it is. https://youtu.be/81aLMRK1ris
 These are all the tribes around the world that they visited. Reminded me of Anthony Bourdain who visited unknown places. https://www.youtube.com/c/BestEverFoodReviewShow/search?query=tribe

I’m visiting for the first time in nearly five years next year and I want to work on my Vietnamese. I learned a small amount from my mom growing up (she worked long hours and did not have much free time) but I otherwise grew up isolated from other Vietnamese people. I’ve tried a few app/services and I’m currently using Duolingo. I am aware, however, of how specific the Hue dialect is, and I’m worried that I’m learning bad habits and potentially making myself even more unintelligible to my relatives. Does anyone know of any services that specifically teach the Hue dialect? Or any tips for someone using Duolingo (which I believe is the northern dialect) and trying to apply what they’d learn to the Hue dialect? 
 Thanks!

However, Vietjet decided to change my flight for 10AM of the same day. First of all, I had never seen any airline bring forward a flight before. Secondly, they refused to refund me the entire amount, and the only solution offered was a "creditshell", which is a credit I can use for future flights with them. Now that I'm back from vacations and can afford to lose some time with this, I wanted to ask if anyone had any success obtaining a full refund from them for a similar situation, or if this is a lost cause and I should just forget about the 70$ I paid. Thanks in advance!

As a French student in Hanoi for 6 months to study or more, with eventually an paid/unpaid internship, what type of health insurance should it take?

 ​
 Tôi là một người dùng mạng di động của nhà Mobifone Hơn 12 năm nhưng lại không thể tin được mình bị ép buộc, chèn áp vào các khoản hợp đông trói buộc kinh khủng này.
 ​
 Ngày trước khi còn dùng gói cước HD70 thì nhà mạng bảo do tốc độ 3G yếu nên không hòa mạng không được. Sau đó nhân viên đề nghị tôi và gia đình sử dụng gói 120k tháng. Hứa hẹn 4G / ngày gọi điện nội mạng miễn phí. Đăng ký 6 tháng
 ​
 Thì ok tôi đăng ký được vì đối với tôi việc quan trọng là hòa mạng tốt.
 ​
 Nhưng Không Ngờ. Tôi đã bị gắng theo một bản hợp đồng trói buộc thiếu tính minh bạch!

 Khi mà đến tại Trung Tâm Mạng Viễn Thông Mobifone Hậu Giang các nhân viên ở đây kêu tôi ký chổ này chổ kia và chỉ nói là ký đồng ý hoa mạng gói 120/ 6 …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm planning a trip to Hoi An soon and I'd love to know the answers to these questions:
  
Do the markets accept cashless/card payments?
 What do they sell at the markets besides souvenirs like bags and things?
 Are there any tourist apps/technologies that help you get around and give you information on the city?
 How's the wifi access when touring around?
 Is the area mostly full of tourists, especially in the markets? Or do locals also frequent those?
  
(Reposting this because I accidentally confused Hoi An with Hanoi)
 Thanks in advance!!

We have planned some of the trip, but we’re not sure if we want to go to Nha Trang or Phan Thiet/Mui Ne. We want to stay 3-4 days in one of those areas.
 Any thoughts?? Pros/Cons as to where to go? The trip is in the beginning of december, and temperature will be considered aswell.

As leaders of both China and Vietnam met recently and in the west the general opinion on the ccp government is pretty bad, now I know that Vietnam has worked to have good relations with both the us and china but It got me thinking what the average Vietnamese here think about China and the ccp?
 Idk if these kinds of posts are allowed but I guess you can remove it if it breaks any rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a Vietnam born and raised millennial. Now I’ve read a lot of writings where it is pointed out that MSG/bột ngọt aversion is originated from a 1968 racist research in USA. For me that explains why the western world is on the err side when it comes to MSG. 
 Still I don’t really know why a lot of Vietnamese, my parents, people of their age, my age, and younger (Gen Z) is still very skeptical with MSG. They:
  
 Makes an effort to avoid eateries/restaurants that they perceive to be using too much MSG
  Claims that they’re nauseous or having headaches when consuming too much or any MSG at all
  Avoid using MSG in their cooking
  
I do find 2-3 to be quite funny because Vietnamese are still using a lot of stock powder/bột nêm which is basically flavored MSG. 
 Is there any knowledge for where this MSG aversion in Vietnam originates? Is it because of the 1968 study that carries to Vietnam during the war and persists thereafter? Do you experience 1 and 2 yourself? I do want to listen to you guys.
 Do you think MSG induced sickness is placebo effect?

 So, I'm half vietnamese but I don't live in Vietnam. Their is a conflict in my vietnamese family about an apartment in Vietnam.
 My grandmother own an apartment and let my aunt/her daughter live in this apartment, free of charge. It was supposed to be only for a few years, but well... After a long time (more than 30 years), my grandmother wanted her daughter to leave the apartment, but her daughter claim that the apartment is now her's because my grandmother didn't reclaim her ownership for a long time.
 My grandmother has the legal document but she has never consulted any official since she got the apartment (so a long time ago).
 I just want to know what is true and how land ownership work in Vietnam. I think my aunt is just lying so that she can keep living in the apartment, but as I don't speak vietnamese it's hard to find informations.
 Not sure if I should post it here ahah, so sorry if not and for any of my mistakes !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, Currently traveling in Vietnam, at the moment I am in Nha Trang getting my scuba certificate. It's super lovely and the people are really nice, some of the cutest super lovely people I've met. But I can't walk down the street without people on their scooters stopping asking me for a ride, people selling glasses, chips, paintings, bracelets, necklaces, tours and private car tours. I get people have to make a living. Which is totally understandable. It's probably more a culture shock to me than anything. I can't walk down the beach without being asked by people every 40 meters I walk if I want to buy their things and knickknacks. It's gotten to a point where I'm starting to feel rude to these people.
 But they also can't take no for an answer and are really really pushy and persistent. What are some ways to get your message across that I don't want to buy without being super rude or guilt tripped into buying? Thanks everyone.

 From what I hear, their dialect doesn't sound like Southern at all, more like Hue dialect but I am not sure. For those that have been to the Central Highlands region, do you know what dialect they speak? Would learning Southern Vietnamese be enough to converse with them or should I learn their specific dialect?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I am a videographer and world traveller from Canada currently visiting Cat Ba. While traveling through Vietnam I am making a video about my trip and I am personally very interested in the fishing traditions of the Vietnamese. When traveling I really value meeting with locals and properly experiencing the places I visit rather than going through the regular tourist route.
 I’m posting to see if there is anyone in the Cat Ba/ Local bay areas that would be willing to show me and my film partner the local experience for a few days. I would love to learn about traditions, see how people in the area have lived, meet families, and fish! It would be amazing to have someone who can translate as I love to interact with local people but am limited by only speaking English.
 The person would need to be okay with being on camera and would definitely get some beautiful photos of them on the adventure!
 Edit: when I say local guide, I do not necessarily mean a tour guide. I am looking more for a local who is interested in making some new friends and wants to show off and educate about the Vietnamese culture

 My teacher 35f Vietnamese has been teaching me for 6 months and I have to admit I was flirting w her. I genuinely like her wit. 
 We have been talking about me coming to visit and she has offered to pay for my ticket from Hà Nội to Đà Nẵng as well as the room while I'm there. It's seems to good to be true. She is just so nice and pretty. In my home country this is beyond abnormal.
 What should I be skeptical about and how do I protect myself from potential dangers?
