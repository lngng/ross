        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been traveling extensively for the past 4 months and looking for a place to settle and recharge for about 3 weeks
 I've been recommended Hoi An as a good place
 What i ideally want is a smaller quieter city, with interesting things to do ( cycling, hikes, day tours, kayaking, etc) Good food options ( emphasis on fresh fruit and veggies and not fried rice and noodles all the time) Affordable cost of living for a rental, groceries and eating out. And security..being able to walk around freely without worry.
 Sounds like a tall order. Does it sound about right, or other places might be better. 
 I would like a place with not too much traffic congestion and the continously honking and motorcycles.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My international friend from Vietnam said then when it comes to dating and finding a partner, money is everything. You can be clapped, short and basically physically reprehensible with an unattractive personality but if your pockets are deep, you still get girls. Not that the notion is foreign to me, but I thought Vietnam prioritised hard-work and good ethics as a attractive trait (taken with a grain of salt). A deeper insight on what occurs in the Vietnamese dating scene is appreciated. Thank you!

I prefer squeezed lemon juice which I squeeze myself. While I was there I saw absolutely no yellow lemons. I just saw the green limes. Whenever I asked at a store for lemons they always showed me limes. I showed a picture of yellow lemons and nowhere has them. Does Vietnam just not have lemons anywhere?

 I will be landing in hanoi, is sapa worth the 12-16 hour detour as I will have to go to sapa then back down to hanoi. Is there any other places like sapa that I would find on my way down to ho chi minh city.
 Otherwise this will be my current itinerary, 3-4 days in (hanoi) > 2 days in (halong Bay) > 2/3 days (phong na) > one day (dong hoi)
  
one day (hue) > 3 days (hoi an) > 1 day (da nang) > 3 days (ho chi minh city) > fly to Thailand. This will be my first trip to asia.
  
I would appreciate any tips, as I am slightly nervous as I haven't traveled much. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm planning on travelling from Ninh Binh to Hoi An on 8th February 2024 in order to spend Tet in a proper city. As I read some bad reviews about the buses online (bus drivers honking and driving like crazy throughout the night, other passengers sleeping in the corridors, people unexpectedly being dropped off in Da Nang and having to wait an hour for another bus to Hoi An), I'm thinking about either taking a train or going back to Hanoi to take an airplane. As I'm pressed on time, I don't mind spending a little more money for a quicker and safer journey.
 Does anyone of you have experiences with ...? - taking a bus from Ninh Binh to Hoi An - taking a train from Ninh Binh to Da Nang and then taking another means of transport (which?) to Hoi An - taking a bus from Ninh Binh to Hanoi, then taking an airplane to Da Nang, and then taking another means of transport to Hoi An

 Some days Before i learn about TET celebrations, i didnt have an idea about this and i want to ask you how this celebration will affect may travel plans which i dont have but for example from the "ultra-touristic" ha-giang loop or ha-long bay cruise to more common things that if they gonna be any available open restaurants, or hotels or museums or everything :) 
 Im arriving at 7-8 february , if you have any recommended places or events in Hanoi to experience the TET celebrations will be totally interesting OR if i have to know any traditional customs and rituals associated with TET in Hanoi and if there are there any specific do's and don'ts for travellers during celebrations? 
 if you are so kind and answer to this silly and boring post , first of all thank you from now ,any info you give is more than welcome the concept tis to give some ideas about whatever you think i have to know about hanoi and TET...
 PS: i found everywhere info to rent a scooter or a motorbike. what about renting cars in vietnam?

(Charging 500k for a 5km journey) to our hotel, which was beside the actual bus stop we were supposed to be dropped at. 
 Our driver made a call on the way to the hotel and when we arrived the hotel was shut. We have literally discussed our early/ late arrival with the hotel but now they had the door and cover shut. (Like it had been abandoned)
 Luckily our taxi driver, who just happened to know where the bus would drop us, and made a call just before dropping us to the hotel, knew of another hotel. He dropped us to this small dingy homestay where he clearly knew the owner and we paid 700k dong for a disgusting room which was not worth 200k dong.
 When we were in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, obviously you had people trying to make a few extra dollars from you, but never so orchestrated as in Vietnam where there seems to be an actual system in place.
 I am just curious, as an Irish person, I would hate to see this happen to Vietnamese tourists coming to our country and would be sure to voice up for it to stop, nor would our local community.
 What are Vietnamese people's thoughts on this ? Does it bother you or do you all enjoy trying to extract as much money as possible from people visiting your country ?

 I’m a young female expat in Hanoi. I’m into my neighbor. I’m sure he lives alone. We often come across each other in the morning. We make eye contact and smile. I really wanna start a conversation and give hints.
 Is it common for women to approach guys directly or indirectly in Vietnam? What are the best ways? Please give me advices.
 Edit: I have an idea. Say hi in the elevator. Then bring him homemade food at night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I’ll be flying out to Ho Chi Minh at the end of February and staying in Vietnam for 35 days, and then flying to Thailand for 26. I’ll be staying in hostels, hopefully in urban areas and doing activities such as the Hai Giang Loop and Trang Boat Tour etc. nothing crazy like camping/hiking or volunteering. 
 At the moment most places in my local area haven’t got the Japanese Encephalitis in stock and my travel clinic said it’s nothing to worry about based on my itinerary.
 Whilst I trust their opinion and expertise - I would love to ask the general to see if anyone has gone to Vietnam and not had the Japanese vac - in my case, how important is it that I have it? If so, its looking like I’ll be getting the shots over there! 
 Thank you in advanced!

 I didn't plan for this so I need to get money exchanged. It would be easier if I could do this by card payment or bank transfer in a Vietnam bank as I don't want to have to withdraw 15+ million dong from an ATM to take to get exchanged.
 Do Vietnamese banks allow foreigners to exchange currency and if so would this be doable by bank transfer or card payment?

Last year in Vietnam we got the tops from red and green bottles of Saigon beer in Hanoi (these tops have red and green dragons on them), but when we had a bottle of 'Saigon Chill' in the south there was no dragon, just a stamp with numbers. We were expecting that this would be a blue dragon. I'm guessing the dragon bottle tops are only in the north.
 I know this sounds silly, but we really want the blue dragon bottle top from Saigon Chill.
 If anyone could get this for us and post it to us in the UK I'd happy pay you £30 for it. If you think you can help can you PM me please?
 By the way, we always try not to bend the bottle top when we take it off. We usually use something like a spoon around the edges to do this.

When I was little, I was told of a Vietnam war but never much of a deal out of it. But as I grow older, it becomes clearer to me that there are still might be many underlying issues and incidents that still occur from the war. From older Vietnamese generations, I often hear that there's still tension 50 years later. Just wanted a more experienced and hopefully objective viewpoint of the matter. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure many of you studied English in school, but was that sufficient to get you to the level you’re at now? For me, school provided a 'logical' understanding of the language. However, I found it challenging to comprehend native speakers because the English taught in textbooks differs significantly from spoken English, and the accents of public school teachers aren’t always perfect.
 Upon finishing school, I struggled to watch videos or movies in English, even though I could somewhat manage reading textbooks - albeit with some effort. There came a point when my favorite show stopped being subtitled in Vietnamese, forcing me to watch it with English subtitles.
 Initially, it was difficult, and I didn’t understand much. But over time, things started to make sense, before I knew it, my YouTube feed had become entirely English - primarily due to the lack of useful content in Vietnamese. The auto subtitle feature of youtube came out around that time so that was super useful too.
 TL;DR: School gave me a foundation in English, but only after watching and reading a lot of English content does it click for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking to apply for a working holiday visa to Vietnam, I would be spending 10 - 12 months there. I’m 27 and from Australia. 
 I have two degrees from an Australian university; Bachelor of Laws & Bachelor of Arts. I have 3 months of work lined up already, and enough savings that I could potentially dedicate 6 months of my time there to volunteering without earning any money. 
 I’ve been in the Scouting movement since I was 8 years old and now I am an adult leader. I have had significant experience volunteering through Scouts. I also spent three years volunteering for a family violence shelter and I have done significant work around support for survivors of sexual violence. 
 Now I am looking into the prospect of volunteering while I am in Vietnam, and I have the time to dedicate myself properly. However, I don’t want to be caught in a scam or do more damage than good. When I search things online, I end up on websites I’m unsure if I can trust. 
 I am looking for any advice people could provide on volunteering in Vietnam ethically, without accidentally contributing to organisations that are doing more harm than good, and without doing harm myself. 
 This isn’t so I can post on social media and paint myself as an amazing person, I don’t even use social media. I genuinely want to spend my time helping people who need it, it’s all I have ever wanted to do. If the answer is that it’s not possible for me to do any good this way then I completely understand that as well. 
 Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Had an uncle today call me up to let me know about his plight with the family land. Needs money or the bank will take it. Also needs some money to smooth out the title. Promises to put the title in my name. 
 If Vietnam wants to evolve into a better society, the scams have to be better.

 So I wanted to ask if there is a vietnamese equavalent meaning a website that ranks vietnamese youtubers based number of subscribers and doesn't just cover the 1000 most popular channels?
 I know this is a long shot but it existed for japanese youtubers why wouldn't possibly exist for vietnamese ones?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys 🫡, this is the first time I've used this function in an app (weirdly???), so I think a lot about the topic that I can discuss with guys. Finally, I wonder why dont i share about schoolwork or daily days. So that reason I'm here. Not rambling more, today I will talk about my ambition of schoolwork. I'm a normal student in my public school which I tried my best to enroll in (it is one of the best in my province). Therefore, when I study there, I try a lot to "catch the life melody". I'm not the type of smart person, the achievement I got is my diligence every single day. In the first year of the class in this school, I studied a lot to be an excellent student (I'm studying a new curriculum, so 9.0 average for 6 subjects to be an excellent student) but I can not. That time, I was so disappointed in myself, because I struggled with studying very much. Fortunately, I learned that studying too much does not mean getting high marks or good results, I have to study effectively, study smarter, and focus on the main lesson/idea in that subject. And u know what, by my efforts and belief in myself, finally the second-year class I got it * That was so amazing!!(^)* I was cheerful when I got praise perk. At that moment, I was so satisfied with my performance academic. Currently, I don't know why but I wanna get higher achievements than now, no longer satisfied with myself. Moreover, I wanna join some activities in school such as dancing, clubs, and more interesting things. As a result, sometimes I burn out, exhausted but I receive new experiences, and worthwhile memories with my friends. 🤔Do you think that when we are young or students we should try our best to achieve the best result? And the ambition like me, is it right?
 Btw, my English is not good, so I hope everyone can sympathize with me😇. Thanks a lot😘

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a motorbike accident some time ago in Vietnam. After the accident a traffic policeman/detective went to the hospital I was in to ask some questions to my Vietnamese coworkers visiting me.
 One of my coworkers told me he wanted to check my messaging history on my phone (I have no idea why). They refused to let him access that.
 After being discharged at the hospital, I went to the police station to meet the other driver I crashed with and fully compensated him for the damages of his car (he didn't suffer any injuries) and we both signed a document to cease any legal case caused by the accident.
 Yesterday I went again to the transit police station to pay for the fines related to the accident while I was driving my motorbike. The policeman gave me a document so I was able to collect back my motorbike after I paid everything. After leaving the police station he texted me on Zalo to ask about the identity card and one more document of one of my coworkers (specifically, the one who refused to show him my chats). Again, I have no idea why he needs that.
 At this point I want to cease any contact with the police since I already compensated the other driver and paid the fines related to the accident.
 Do I have any legal obligation to reply to the policeman who keeps texting me on Zalo? Should I stop replying to his messages and get a lawyer in case they require more documents in the future?
 I'm starting to feel paranoid about the whole situation.
 Any help is appreciated. Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are putting the finishing touches on our North Vietnam itinerary in late March and we're deciding where to spend an extra day: Pu Luong or Cat Ba. We're definitely doing Pu Luong for 1 night and Ha Long Bay for 1 night but not sure where to add the extra night between Pu Luong and Cat Ba. We're also going to Hanoi and Ninh Binh for multiple nights but this the part of the trip where we're undecided still so any advice much would be much appreciated.
 Here are my thoughts: 
  
If we do 1 day in Ha Long Bay, we'll only do a 1 day cruise and skip Cat Ba. If we do 2 days, we'll do 1 day cruise and 1 day Cat Ba and rent a scooter to explore the island. Hearing mixed reviews on this part of the trip so wondering if 1 day cruise is enough. 
 I know this won't be peak time of year for rice fields in Pu Luong but it looks like a beautiful, less touristy area which is appealing since I expect the other locations to be crowded. 1 day will be pretty rushed but also not sure how much there is to see. 
  
I have no idea what to expect in either place outside of some Google images and reddit posts but if anyone has been to both places – especially in this time of year – it would be awesome to get your thoughts.

 Any tips or recommendations would be welcomed!

 4 years ago I did the same but all around the north, bordering China. It was one of the best trips I ever did and I've been almost everywhere in SEA.
 I'm hoping to find some ethnic markets with the typical colorful fabrics and local crafted products sold by the very same people that make them, as I did in the past in Coc Ly Market up north.
 Was also thinking about stopping by in some Hotspring, but nothing high-end, just a nice location and a modest hotspring where that local people may use.
 Any other recommendations for the trip are welcome, I'm mostly interested in nature, local culture, gastronomy, scenic areas and authentic places, I'm not into fancy stuff.
 Thanks Reddit!

 I'm currently in Ho Chi Minh City and I'm about to head up to Buôn Ma Thuot for a couple of days to visit Yok Don National Park. After that it's off to Cambodia! But I don't want to retrace my steps back to Ho Chi Minh in order to do so - I was hoping there'd be a bus that would take me directly over the border. 
 Generally on my trip so far, when there's no advance info about buses online (via 12go/baolau), I just arrive and there'll be some local company advertising the route I need, and it's all good. But I thought I'd ask anyway.
 Ideally I'd like to stop off at Kracheh before heading on to Phnom Penh. Is anyone aware of public/private bus links from Buôn Ma Thuot going across the border and on to either of these places? Or is it inevitable that I have to head back to Saigon first? 
 Thanks! :)

So I wonder if it's okay to travel through Vietnam (we'll probably enter between Ho Chi Minh and Phnom Penh) during Tet or it's a completely dumb idea because we might end up stranded? The travel guides are not very clear so what is the actual situation there?
 The other option is to stay in Cambodia until the Tet is over, but then twoo weeks is hardly enough to see Vietnam which we wanted in the first place.
 Thanks for replies, we are looking forward to see your beautiful country!

If so, I would I go about finding one? (i'd obviously pay for lodging and food for the guide)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I know tipping culture isn't that prevalent here, but I think in my situation it is. To start off, I'm a student travelling Vietnam, so on a small budget. I recently had a fall and hurt my foot, which got worse over a few days. I went to hospital today under the advice of my hotel, and they have been nothing short of amazing. The manager came with me to help with translating, waited 2 hrs in hospital with me before going home to her family. One of the bus boys gave me his arm to lean on accompanying me to the taxi and was ready waiting for me when I returned. A third one followed holding an umbrella over my head. All these kind gestures made my experience that much easier, and I wanted to thank them. I'd love to leave them separate tips, without digging too deep in my budget but without offending them either ... What do you think is a good sum to tip in this situation? Thank you in advance for your insights!

I received the whole Rosetta Stone courses last year for free as a gift so I'm thinking I might as well get started into the SEA region and am looking at Vietnamese as the starting point. That said I ask would it help in learning Khmer and other Austroasiatic languages across the regions among the plenty of regional peoples and ethnicities outside the dominant cultures and nations of the Indochina region? Would it help learn languages of nearby countries that use languages from different families and not considered as within Indochina like Thai and Burmese? Just to be specific so I don't forget about it, would it help with Lao (as Laos is part of Indochina but its language is from a different family, the Kra–Dai which Thai is also a member of)?

 I was raised in Canada, but my parents are from Phu Thuan An Duong right beside Hue(Ghost Town I know lol). I’m looking to go back with my parents again within 1 or 2 years. I went last year to Hoi An, Da Nang, and a bit of Hue. I went for a week for all 3, which I felt wasn’t enough. I felt as if I was missing a lot out of Da Nang and Hue as I did mostly the touristy stuff. Things that I’ve done was Pagodas(Hue), Golden Bridge(Amusement Park), Lady Buddha, Love Bridge, and Night Market in Da Nang. I was thinking of hitting up Saigon along the way, but I wanted to explore more of my village. My parents didn’t explore much of Hue when they were younger as it was a bit of drive to get into the city.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,im a 21 years old kid and this is a very very stupid tinder story i would like to share for everyone. I matched this girl on Tinder on january around tet 2022 (let called her N) and first N is very kind very nice to me offer to even buy me things at first she catch me off guard by buying me some stuff and kept in mind at this point we havent even met yet,then she starting to stalk my fb account then she’ll said she my friends cousin and i later on confirm that yes she is indeed my friend’s cousin and thay raised trust level in me after a few days she asked me for a gift and valentine is just around the corner so why not ? N asked me to send her 100$ for her gift because i already somewhat trusted N so i send her the money after a while i asked to meet her but she kept asking for more money and being a stupid 19 years old,I send her total 800-900$ ish im not sure around 18mil,then around 3 months talking i found out she was also talking to this singapore guy for nearly 2-3 years and he told me he had plan to come to vietnam to meet her and he also was sending her money which is crazy and idk how much men she had tricked (if you guys are in similar situation or needed more info d/m me)i had kept this secret for so long because it was so stupid and tbh really embarrassing to even tell anyone. p/s:my “friends” that was her cousin told me later on after i told him about her he said they werent that close and she is on his mom family side so before any of you guys said she is catfish ect and tbh with you guys she might be tho,cause she give me her friends bank account everytime i transferred her the money,this is the most dumbest thing i have ever done and idk what’s wrong with me at that moment.I just want to get this off my chest

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a trip going up from Singapore through to Vietnam. I currently have two full days and nights in Ho Chi Minh City and was trying to sneak a day to fly over to Hanoi and check it out, really just to say I saw it, but I would say Ho Chi Minh City appeals to me more. Is it worth taking the flight over to see the city or should I just book an extra day in Ho Chi Minh City to see it more completely?
 I might not be back in the area for five to ten years.
 I realize a lot of people will want to reply with something like "It all depends on you" and "We can't know what you enjoy" type comments, but please refrain from those. It's obvious that everyone is different and the right decision for one is not the right decision for another. I guess I'm really just asking if a third day in Ho Chi Minh will be more productive and fun than trying to squeeze whatever I can out of Hanoi in 15 waking hours or so.

 Just wondering, which International Schools are considered the best in terms of salary, work/life balance, culture, allowances, professional development? What is the process of application? Are there any international schools to stay away from? 
 I'm currently an Assistant Principal/Instructional Leader in Australia and have been doing this for the past two years. Previously I was a primary school leader (happy to jump back on class as well.)
 Can someone please explain the "Tiered system" I keep reading about in regards to international school? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

I'm just curious, how much VND is too much to walk around with? If I know i'm going to the market or just to dinner, I know I can plan accordingly, but is it unreasonable to walk around with like 1-2 million VND in smaller bills? Sorry if this is a dumb question.
 EDIT
 Thank you to everyone who took the time to answer, I really appreciate it. Except the dumb dumb that thinks I should carry around 20 million VND like he does. 🤣👍

Except the artistic community—I cannot find any. In Indonesia you have almost everyone having a metal band, playing a traditional instrument or painting. For a lifetime musician and artist it was very important to have it in my life. 
 I also love independent cinema, clip making. Is there anything like that in Da Lat or HCMC? I make rock music, enjoy black metal and many things like that. I love and I need a feeling of a good art community to enjoy life.
 Or it’s better just to focus on life on here and just sometimes go to Bandung and see how the scene is evolving there? 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, long term lurker and first time posting here. My mental health has been derailing extremely bad due to my parents constantly forcing me to endure my granddad’s verbal and emotional abuse. 
 I’m going to visit Vietnam in February and I’m scared for my life. My entire family each has a way to verbally and mentally abuse me but my granddad is by far the worst. He would say things like “you’ll wait till I’m dead then you’d come visit? You ungrateful, disgraceful, uneducated child”, or “why don’t you f**k off and never come back” etc. These episode would last for at least 2-4 hours and he won’t let me leave the room or if it’s a phone call, he’ll cuss me out and hang up without saying anything else. 
 My mom would force me to endure these episodes because “you owe them your life. Who do you think give us money to raise you”. And my dad is just passive aggressive saying things like “it’s fine con, no need to come back and visit us”. And my sister on the other hand is so worried about the inheritance that she’s yelling at me how the West (I’m from the US) has ruined me and my values are killing our chances for a good share of inheritance… I’m just so lost and hurt and I truly don’t want to go back at all. But I have no choice. Is it just my family?

 Tuổi trẻ tài lanh, tui mong kiếm được tiền nhiều. Đọc để anh em rút kinh nghiệm nhé. Tui ghi như một trang nhật ký hành trình thôi. Ghi rồi quên, nhưng lâu lâu sẽ lục lại để nhìn về quá khứ.
 Ừm thì, tui tốt nghiệp BK, đi làm kỹ thuật được 1 năm. Cộng với tiền học bổng, tui đi làm thì để dành được 130tr. Tui không đi chơi, ăn uống thì ở nhà. Với tui, đó là một số tiền tiết kiệm kha khá để khởi nghiệp :)
 Nhưng mà khổ một nỗi, sự việc ấy đã đến vào 25/04/2023. Chuyện xảy ra 2 tuần sau khi chia tay bồ. Lúc đó, tui khá trầm cảm. Do lần đầu có người yêu, nên chia tay với tui là cú sốc tâm lý. Bây giờ nghĩ lại, không biết tui quăng tiền vào là vì chia tay rồi nghĩ quẩn, hay thực sự là tui quá non. Dù sao đi nữa, tui cũng ngu như bò.
 Mọi chuyện bắt đầu từ một cuốc điện thoại, rồi qua Zalo, rồi qua Telegram. Trên Telegram, tui nhắn tin với tài khoản NVHD_DUYTUNG. Hắn tự gọi mình là người hướng dẫn và chỉ cách kiếm tiền.
 Bước đầu tiên, hắn cho tui vào nhóm và làm nhiệm vụ. Yêu cầu cũng khá đơn giản. Vào trang web tv360, like bộ phim được chỉ định và chụp lại làm bằng chứng. Mỗi nhiệm vụ được 15000₫, và tui làm được 4 lần. Thế là có 60000₫ bỏ túi. Hay vờ lờ.
 Nhưng mà nhiệm vụ thứ 5 thì khác. Lần này là nhiệm vụ ăn tiền. Chúng nó cho tôi vào một nhóm nhỏ gồm 3 người (tay trong hết). Sau đó, tôi được tạo tài khoản trên trang web chúng nó và bắt đầu chơi tài xỉu. Thề với anh em, trước khi lên đồn trình báo, tôi còn méo biết tôi đang thuộc diện đánh bạc :)
 Nên thôi, anh em rút kinh nghiệm xương máu từ thằng ngu này nhé.

 I am a college student in LA and am looking to travel to Vietnam with my girlfriend in the summer. I have no idea where to start. I was looking at a lot of islands by Ha Long and was interested there. I am looking for somewhere with nice water, beaches, and access to city as well. Also, since we are students we would like to minimize the cost as much as possible. So if anyone has any suggestions for cheapest ways to travel to and in vietnam that would be great. Also, how does the currency exchange work? Roughly how much will it cost to eat and do activities in vietnam for 5 days? If anybody can answer even some of my questions and give recommendations that would be amazing.

 Thank you!

I have unfortunately never gotten a confirmation number, but I have proof over text message that I got an appointment in August 2023 to go in and submit all the requested paperwork. 
 All my attempts to get an update from anyone over email, text and phone call have been completely ignored. And I don't know what to do anymore. How can I hold them accountable and give me an update? 
 I know I definitely qualify, and the guy I spoke to last said they are working on it, but that was in September. It's a bit of an urgent matter, so I'd like to at least understand if they will never give it to me for some reason, so I can involve a third party service, unless somebody here may have any other suggestions? 
 Would really appreciate constructive insights!

 Hiện tại mình dùng 1660s với một con màn được nhận 60hz nhưng thật tế nó là 144hz. Có thể do dây chưa đúng chuẩn nên chưa thử được.
 Câu hỏi của mình: Tại sao 1660s chạy ở 60hz hoặc 75hz ở một số tựa game chỉ đạt được ~170fps và card chạy rất nóng 70 80, kêu rất to.
 Ngược lại lúc được đẩy lên 120hz thì có dấu hiệu giảm? 
 Vậy có phải mình phải chạy chuẩn 144hz full HD thì mới đạt nhiệt độ ổn 50 60 và không kêu to nữa ko?
 Mình ngu ngơ công nghệ, anh em có thể giải thích mình rõ hơn được không ạ? Cám ơn anh em
 Trên thực tế em xem test thì ít nhất cũng 250 đến 300fps

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a female backpacker and have been travelling through Vietnam for a few weeks (I have been to Ha Noi, HCMC and Nha Trang so far). I am overweight and in my research about the country I learnt in advance that the topic of weight comes up very often and that the cultural approach to the topic is very different than for example in europe where I come from. Now it has actually happened to me many times here that I have been asked about my weight or have been pressurised by strange men to get on a scale etc., but as I have already anticipated this, I try not to be too hurt and just let it pass me by. However, I haven't had a single really friendly encounter in Vietnam so far and I'm really starting to wonder whether it's because of my weight that I'm being treated more disrespectfully? I'm a very polite person and try to smile a lot and always say please, thank you, hello and goodbye but I never get a reply and hardly anyone speaks to me for more than two words (unless it's about my weight). 
 As I am travelling alone, the experience of being here feels very lonely and sad and I wonder if I can change anything personally or if it really is my appearance?
 Edit: as I think it's important. I am really overweight like 40kg too much. Not like 10kg and just a bit more chubby.

 nhà mình nó là một cấu trúc như này, người sống tệ -> chửi cay nghiệt người sống tử tế ko có lỗi gì -> từ mặt, là gđ sống chung nhưng ko giao tiếp, ăn riêng. Gia đình mà như vậy mình thấy rất tệ. Kiểu mình đâu có làm gì sai mà sao người ta lại cư xử như vậy, như cố tình huỷ hoại mqh rồi khiến cái ko khí mqh nặng nề. 
 như ba mình với mẹ mình, mẹ mình chung thuỷ ko có lỗi gì, nhưng từ xưa ba mình đã xưng mày tao với mẹ, rồi chửi những lời rất cay nghiệt, chửi cả ông bà ngoại, con cái, chửi mẹ mình khốn nạn, đồ con chó, v.v. từ xưa mình đã nghe những trận chửi đánh và mình ước gì có thể là con của những người nhìn hiền hoà, nc nhẹ nhàng, dĩ hoà vi quý.... chứ ko phải như hiện thực gđ mình. 
 a mình cũng vậy, đi chửi mấy đứa e là mất dậy, đạo đức giả, diễn, giả tạo, những cái từ ngữ đó khiến mình thấy tồi tệ và bất an. Kiểu như ổng chửi người khác để che lấp con người hãm của ổng. Khi ổng y chang những câu ổng chửi người khác. 
 những lời chửi xúc phạm khiến một đứa chỉ cần ai nói nặng lời cũng bị tổn thương khiến nó như nhấn chìm tinh thần mình xuống. 
 Mình ko phải một đứa ưa ngọt, ưa nịnh, nếu có gì phàn nàn thì cũng phàn nàn một cách vừa phải, nc bình thường chứ đâu phải thốt ra những từ ngữ cay nghiệt bạo lực ngôn ngữ như vậy. 
 Cuộc sống mọi người xung quanh như thế nào, có gặp những người hay chửi cay nghiệt ko

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So on my recent trip to Vietnam, I ate Bun Dau Mam Tom and Bo Nhung Dam.
 For both of these meals, we were given accompaniments to wrap the meats with. We were also given small rectangular sheets of rice paper.
 From our limited communication with the restaurant staff, we understood that you just wrapped everything up in the rice paper dry and ate it like that, without softening it with water.
 Did we get that correct? 
 I’m trying to recreate these dishes at home now, and I bought some rice paper, but it seems a bit too hard to wrap like the ones we had in Vietnam. Did I buy the wrong rice paper? Or are we suppose to make it pliable with water first and then dry it back out?
 Please help!

 I am a zen buddhist from the netherlands, and I will be visiting Vietnam this march.
 I was hoping to spend some time at the Thiền viện Trúc lâm Tây Thiên Temple. But if possible, for a bit more than other tourist would like. I am not sure what the customs are for such a request. Is there a way to reach out to the temple? Does somebody know what I can expect? 
 Thank you for your help!
 Looking forward to learn more about Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Briefly, I was in a 3 year relationship with a Vietnamese girl who has lived in a western country since she was a teenager. She is 36 now. She is very westernised in the sense of liberal thought, accent etc, however her parents are very traditional. I am from a non-Vietnamese background. 
 She had recently divorced her husband who is Vietnamese. They had an 8 year old son. I also have a son of the same age. Early in the relationship, her ex-husband would come around to her apartment when I was there for the custody change over. She asked me to ‘hide’ in her room so that he would not see me. She claimed that he was still talking to her mother and would tell her she has a boyfriend. 
 I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but this continued for months. I never met her parents. She told me this was ‘cultural’ and her mother would come around eventually. 
 I made to the mistake of meeting up with her on an overseas trip to the US which she had taken with her sister, to meet up with their cousins. I was told that I had to meet her in a neutral location, as I could not see the cousins because her mother had told them that she was still married. During this trip she broke up with me. We got back together a few times, but this issue continued and caused a lot of issues. Eventually, she broke up with me by text message after 3 years of emotional investment and me hoping things would change. I never saw her again.

 The officer had limited English but showed up at our door and demanded to be let in to our home to check our passports. 
 We let him in, and after writing up some report that we could not read, he told us (through translator app) we did not meet whatever requirements for residency (or something like that). 
 He then tried to get us to sign the report, which I refused saying i won’t sign something I can’t read. 
 My husband called our Airbnb host who spoke with the officer and then told us we didn’t have to sign anything. shortly after the officer left. 
 For some context, we have been in our airbnb in Da Nang for 2.5 weeks (will be here another 2). My husband and i are here with our 2 year old. We just work all day while he goes to daycare basically.

 Chà Trà Tea Room - 5 Ngõ 73 Giang Văn Minh, Đội Cấn, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam
 Long story - We wandered in this alley and discovered this tea house. They immediately welcomed us. It was the brother of the owner and a local guest, drinking tea. The place looks like a museum, displaying about a hundred of handmade teapots, which are the owner’s collection. 
 They offered us to take a seat, and started brewing tea for us, and it was delicious. Then they offered me to seat in the brewer’s place, with all the equipment and asked me to try brew some tea, teaching me the ceremony procedure. Then the owner’s son approached, and he could speak English so he started translating and telling us about the history of the store, the teas, etc, asking us about our travelling, our country. It felt so warm, welcoming, it was the highest level of hospitality. Then they brought also boiled corn, while changing teas and brewing more and more. They didn’t ask or accept a penny, and said that drinking tea there is free for anyone. Afterwards the Owner (the dad), his wife, and his friend ( some national tea expert) came. They started making even more tea, that tasted too good to be true. The dad started telling us about the tea culture in Vietnam, about their hospitality, healing properties of the teas, the soul component, it was genuinely wonderful and exciting. Almost 3 hours flew by in a blink. We got to buy a pu-erh cake that is made with tea between 200-500 years old. 
 The interior is really cozy, and the atmosphere is so tranquil and peaceful. We loved it, and i think that it should be much much much more popular. Their family is wonderful and made us feel like home!

 Thank you for anyone have joined the last survey about monopoly. However, due to the requirement of information about the players (The "Who" part in 5W+1H), my team had to make another Goggle form to get some information about boardgame players in general rather than only monopoly alone. This help us get a better understanding about the relationship between players lifestyle and their preference on the theme. (Honestly, I don't know why but they wanted to)
 The link I post here is the translated version: https://forms.gle/qPatvVe1xD8jbBh48
 The form will include the following question:
  
Genders
 Age range
 Location (The continets you from)
 Occupation
 How you depict your lifestyle?
 Have you heard or played any boardgame before?
 The reasons you came to board game?
 Something you don't like about the board game you've played?
 Where you often played board game?
 Favorite theme.
  
I hope to get some respond from you guys soon and sorry for being weird. Bye~
 For Vietnamese, you can use this local / original Vietnamese version: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxBOm-Mp2jzBeqAkrKMrzu-5FEvMj3NtDlcujECbeHXCA2sQ/viewform
 Update: Added question about Location.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to teach here for a year or more. Right now I am finishing some things with my MA and will be moving around a bit so I don't expect to look for a job until after Tet. I ran into a foreigner that has been working here for 5 years that said he just paid a visa agent when he got here to get him a work permit before he had a job and that I should just do that. 
 Is that:
 A. completely illegal and should be avoided at all costs? 
 B. Quasi-legal and not a big deal? 
 C. Not a problem at all but might cost a little bit more money (he said he paid $400 usd for everything) than the regular way of getting a job offer and going from there?
 D. Something else I haven't thought of?

I visit Vietnam pretty often and figure having a bank account is probably the best option (as opposed to using my visa credit card or exchanging for cash). I just need to pay people while in Vietnam using ebanking, no need for international transfers. Document wise I only have the passport. What's my best option? Is there a bank that won't require otp for every transaction? I want to be able to pay for things when I'm in the US too (and won't have the phone number)

I ran into someone this morning while riding my motorbike, and they claimed I hit their motorbike and demanded 100,000 to get it fixed. They forced me to brake as they rode ahead of me. Although I was a little apprehensive, I offered them 200,000 to solve the situation and asked for change because I didn't want to get into any difficulty(lmao I'm that naive). I also believed that I had struck their motorbike. But after taking a peek at my wallet and realizing I had a lot of cash, they demanded more. Now that I knew they were trying to scam me, I seized the opportunity to "steal" my 200,000 and fled as quickly as possible. 
 They looked so gangster-like that I believed I had somehow lost my sense of reason. Oh and they did that on a crowd street too.

 2) As far as I'm aware I don't need a voltage converter to safely plug in my UK power supply, just a plug converter, is this correct? Any other tips to protect my PC? Last time I was in VN there were blackouts, I've got a UK multi plug which has a surge protector which I can bring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is a repeat post, but my family (43M (American), 39F (Born in Vietnam, but is a US citizen,) and two children under 12 (both born in the US) will be traveling to Vietnam this fall. 
 Last time we were there (my wife and I), every hotel we stayed at required us to surrender our passports to the hotel until our departure. They would claim the government required this to report us to the local establishment. We had one bad incident where the hotel has bugs and we requested to leave immediately, but they would not give us our passports until we paid them (even though we didn't stay more than an hour). 
 Is this still a standard practice? To clarify, we did stay at local establishments, not corporate companies, like Hilton. First, we had concerns if we would even get our passports back, and our other concern was if something should happen while we were exploring that we would need it. Thank you for the advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a Chinese who was born in the mainland of China. Because China and Vietnam are both ruled by a communist Party. So I am curious and want to ask several questions.
 1.Can Vietnamese connect to international internet with freedom?
 2.Is it safe to criticize the general secretary directly?
  
Are most people satisfied with the communist party in Vietnam?
 
If you feel that your right is hurt, is it useful to report it to the government and will the government help you?
 
 The answers in China are no. So I am curious about the answers in Vietnam.

 I hope you all are well.
 I am planning to visit Vietnam, and thought to book the first week at a homestay to save costs.
 Do you have any advice on keeping my belongings safe when I leave them at the homestay? I could strap every important item to my body and triple-lock it, but that can get inconvenient.
 Any ideas? Should I just splurge for a proper hotel with a safe?
 Thanks in advance.

 During our daughters first birthday I was able to meet her extended family and someone must have said something because grandfather showed up. He said he was relieved I was not white, they had only told him I was American so he didn’t know I was Mexican American. He bid me to drink rice wine with him and he was very friendly after I told him California and Texas were taken from Mexico. He replied ‘you’re not American by choice!’
 Let me tell you this wasn’t an experience I thought I would ever have.

Làm pha chế thì tay mình yếu ko chặt đc trái dừa và thao tác xay sinh tố nhanh. Mình thấy mình ko hợp. Mỗi người sẽ có cv phù hợp riêng và ko nên ép bản thân phải làm cv mà mình thấy ko hợp đúng ko mn. Vì mình biết mình chậm chạp luống cuống mình ko làm đc. 
 Như người ta nói mình sang làm pha chế, pha chế ko giới hạn độ tuổi với lương cao, đỡ chạy bàn nhiều, nghe danh làm pha chế cũng oai hơn là làm phục vụ. Mấy người lanh tay chân khỏe nhanh thường làm pha chế chứ ít người chịu làm phục vụ vì nó cực có chỗ còn kiêm cả tạp vụ dọn dẹp. Phục vụ thường làm part time chứ full time mấy ai có sức làm, người nào làm vì cần tiền mới làm. 
 Mình kiểu thất nghiệp loser nên đi làm phục vụ cho có cv có lương mỗi tháng. Nếu nghỉ chỗ này thì chỉ biết đi xin làm phục vụ chỗ khác. Chứ cũng chẳng biết làm gì khác. Dù cv phải tiếp xúc với rất nhiều người, va chạm đủ thứ khiến mình một đứa hướng nội thiếu tự tin choáng ngợp và tụt năng lượng chỉ muốn rời chỗ làm ra chỗ chỉ có một mình. Mình thấy khó khăn trong suy nghĩ tâm lý và mình ko hợp làm việc tập thể, mình thấy mình khác biệt.
 Còn tự tạo công việc online nào đó trong phòng mình thì mình thấy chán chường, có những yếu tố con người nhà toxic, những lời lẽ cay nghiệt khiến tinh thần mình như bị nhấn chím xuống ko làm đc cái gì... Mình mở phim mở nhạc lên để chill khiến tâm trạng tốt hơn đỡ buồn chán. Rồi mãi trì hoãn những việc tưởng tượng trong đầu. Vòng lặp đó mình biết nó sẽ thế trong năm mới. Mình chán mình quá mà mình ko thoát ra đc. Một đứa tính cách dẩm, mình ko nhất quáng đc suy nghĩ, lưỡng lự, khó lựa chọn, tâm lý ko vững làm kiểu gì cũng hủy hoại hết. Mình ám ảnh sợ xã hội. Những ánh mắt họ nhìn mình, đánh giá cà khịa ném đá mình.
 Năm mới già thêm một tuổi mình vẫn thấy tâm lý loser khiến mình thấy mỗi ngày thật tồi tệ, bất an...

 I'm travelling to Vietnam on the 8th of February. I had booked everything, all bussess and accommodations. The plan was to go to Ha Giang on the February the 10th and do the Ha Giang Loop for 4 days and then go to Cat Ba.
 However, my bus got cancelled on the 10th of February because of the Tết Holiday in Vietnam. I've tried booking other busses on the 9th, 10th and 11th of February, but all got cancelled. Travelling on the 8th is not really an option, because I arrive late in the evening in Hanoi.
 Do you guys have any tips regarding travelling to Ha Giang on the 10th of February during the Tết holiday? Is travel by bus possible at all during this period?
 Thank you in advance!

 Then once I have my luggage and my checked box, the guys at the exit would scan my stuff and even if I follow all the rules, they’ll say they detected something like fish or meat in my box. I’d say nope, I don’t have any and they’ll threaten to cut open all my boxes to make sure, or they’ll just let me go with some “coffee” money ($10) per security guy. There’s usually 2 of them. 
 One time I tried to stand up for myself and told them I’m following all the laws and regulations, they cut my box opened right there and moved my stuff all over then told me I’m good to go without giving me tape to fix the box….
 I only see this happen to other Vietnamese?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I will be 23 soon this year. I am trying to decide if I should try for Peace Corp in VN (that is if I get accepted/I pass the medical exams), or try for TEFL.I am trying to see if I should try applying for Peace Corp in VN or just do TEFL in Vietnam. I am currently doing an English teaching volunteer experience as of now (soon I might get a temporary teacher's assistant position), graduated already with a bachelors and have a TEFL cert. My Vietnamese is at A2 (heritage speaker) and I am working to improve it.
 My goals is to see more of the culture in everyday life and learn more of the language. I am unsure of the pros and cons to either option. That being said I would like to do Peace Corp at some point in my life. Either way I would need to save up it turns out when the VN cohort leaves is approximately around the same time I plan to leave.I see that by the time of this year, I will probably be at a low B1.
 My main concerns are really if I would be able to learn the language to around B2/C1 by the end of the two years (plans are to continue taking classes and studying, as well as using the language as much as I can). I did post in the TEFL and peace corp subreddits but I wanted to get some perspectives. I was recommended by a user on r/expats to post here too.
 Originally my plan is if I get accepted to Peace Corp in VN (assuming I get accepted and pass the medical/legal exams) and I go, I would do it for the entire duration and then evaluate. If not, I would do TEFL for two years and then evaluate. Right now I graduated but I haven't found anything in my field and I figured I might as well get my Vietnamese to advanced since that is what I wanted to do since I was a kid. I could go back to the States and do a different career afterwards, sure I would be setback but I don't have much to lose.
 I would also like to see if anyone has experience doing either TEFL or Peace Corp or something similar to what I am wanting to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. My uncle died in VN (he’s a US citizen as are most of the family). He has an estranged son (none of us know him or are in contact with him) and while my other uncles and mom was handling the death certificate, the US consulate was able to get a hold of his son. Unfortunately his son considered some options verbally but stopped responding, so there’s nothing in writing. There is no will. My uncle also has no assets.
 We have the means (and want to) bury him as we have a family cemetery in VN. It seems like my parents and other uncles couldn’t get permission to move forward with the burial. How does next of kin responsibilities work? Can’t they just keep going down the line of kin if the first one doesn’t take action? I’m just sad that his body is stuck at the hospital indefinitely and none of us can get closure.
 I also don’t want my family to get in trouble if they attempt to get the body from the hospital. Does anyone know if we should try to get a Vietnamese lawyer involved or if there’s anything more we can do?
 Thanks!

We paid extra for the exit row seats and as we were about to take off one of the staff told my partner she had to put her purse in the over head storage which I thought was odd but he came back and asked a few times before making her place it up there. She had both our passports, credit cards, $800AUD and my wallet in her purse so she wasn’t happy about it leaving her side. The flight departed at 2:30am so as you’d expect we fell asleep. Only realising as soon as we’d left the airport that the cards and cash were gone. 
 Has anyone had a similar experience? Not really sure what to do here or who to report it to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My family member and I want to travel to Europe. We have been saving up money for a one-week tour, perhaps via Vietravel. We have often been told that it's not possible for those who haven't traveled to any other countries to apply for a Schengen visa. While we can afford to travel for one week in Europe, we do not have enough funds to visit other nearby countries beforehand. I believe that as long as we have proper documentation, can prove that we have enough budget to finance our trip, and have a well-prepared travel plan - in this case, it's on the tour agency's side - we will be able to obtain a travel visa. But, is that not enough?
 Thank you in advance.
 edit: What if I only have one year left till my passport expires? If I travel to several SEA countries this year, get a new passport next year, do my past travels still count?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that I have to respect the elders, but it always frustrates me so much. 
 I have some medical problems, and I have to visit the hospital like once a month. It's the hospital, so most of the people there tend to be older, like 50 and above
 And they always cut the line no matter what they do. I was waiting for my turn for an X-ray, and I could see grandpas trying to cut the line, storming into the doctor's office trying to get the service they want despite seeing lines of other people waiting, just for them to be politely asked to get out and get in line.
 At the cashier, it was even worse, everyone was like all trampling all over each other, trying to squeeze against each other in order to be the one that got the service first. It frustrated me so much because I was like, what was the hurry? Just wait in a goddamn line. Waiting in line wouldn't even work because someone would always try to cut it, and they wouldn't even care that they hit many people in the course of doing so.
 And don't even make me start with the bus. They always must be the one who gets in first and got the best seat even if it causes some jamming. 
 I see this type of behaviour much more often in our older generation, like 50 and above, than our younger counterpart.
 Do you guys notice the same thing too, or is it just the people where I live?

I’ve used it for 2 1/2 hours before but I was around Ho Chi Minh City so I think maybe that was something to do with it. Grab will seemingly let me order the ride, but I’m not sure if the driver can see the destination before he accepts or not? If anyone has any experience with this or something like it, I would love to hear it.

 She doesn't like it because it sounds like a Vietnamese phrase which means 'impish child' or 'energetic troublesome child'.
 BUT...she can't find it online because she doesn't know the exact phrase.
 Does anybody know the phrase...or is she being troublesome?
 Hint: 'lee low' is only a part of the phrase.

I want their names to have meaning and it’s important to the story but I also want to show respect to the Vietnamese language and naming practices. I understand that the way a Vietnamese name is written is Surname/Middle name/Given name and that the person is always greeted by their given name but (so I have read). I really don’t want to just use google translate and total screw it up and come off super ignorant. I understand that Nguyên is the most common surname in Vietnam so I have already chosen that surname for my Vietnamese characters. They are supposed to have common names as I’m trying to have them represent a large part of the general public on both the Vietnam side of the story and the American side (Smith is the surname of my American characters). So as for the Vietnamese names I need help finding something that works for:
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Bright Moon (feminine, born 1930)
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Day Star (masculine, born 1925)
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Night Star (masculine, born 1951)
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Caring Soul (feminine, born 1932)
 Thank you so much, I appreciate anyone who can give me a hand.

Ever where I look people young and old were smoking out of bamboo pipes. Coming from California they look like bongs but I heard a whistle when an old man took a toke off one and I didn't smell any Marijuana. This morning walking out of an egg coffee place I see a guy packing one of these pipes, he was tightly rolling something in his fingers to load into the pipe. Is this tobacco?? I assume people aren't smoking cannabis, hash, or opium out in the open like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào các bạn!
 I (24F) am travelling to Saigon soon to meet my family and relatives. I'll be staying for the whole month of february and I am looking for casual and wholesome hangouts with locals as well as other Viet kieus/expats/tourists if possible. 
 I am born and raised in Sweden and currently work as a freelance Swedish-Vietnamese interpreter. So conversing in any language is fine for me (VN, ENG, SWE). 
 My hobbies include: * Dancing (k-pop, traditional chinese dance, girly hip-hop, pole dance)
  
Learning foreign languages (self-studying Mandarin and Italian atm)
 
Meeting and talking to new people (huge extrovert)
 
Explore new places and hangout spots (love adventures)
 
Makeup, clothes, shopping, reading, eating good food, snacking (streetfood etc.)
 
 I dislike: * Clubbing (grown out of it unfortunately), but loud and lively bars are fun! 
  
Selfish and egocentric people 
 
Gambling (not for me, and I lose all the time at tiếng lên 😭)
 
Alcohol in large quantities. I'm not much for the nhậu culture but I'm fine if other people wants to do it as long as it doesn't spiral out of control
 
 I'm only open for 1-1 meetups with girls. Otherwise I'd love to have a mixed group of people to make plans with.
 See you in Saigon! 🥰

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently on a trip in Vietnam with my parents who have not been back home in almost 30 years. They immigrated to America when they were in their early 20s, so I was born and raised there. My mom's talking to our cab driver about how much Vietnam has changed then as well as the cultural and value differences between the two countries. Specifically their conversation about family values had me in tears. I knew that Vietnamese culture has a very heavy emphasis on family. Most times, you got whole generations living in the same house. Everybody is constantly supporting and looking after one another like parents will provide for their kids regardless of their age. Similarly, even after the children are all grown up, they stay behind to take care of their family. However, American family values is not like that. Sure children love their parents, but they're quick to move on and live their life as soon as they're able to support themselves. Which I would say is true. Lot of kids try to move out as soon as they hit 18 which is considered a transition to adulthood. I think a good amount of them will use college as their escape from home. My brothers and I all have goals to move out, start our own careers/lives as soon as we're able to, and she's expecting to probably go to a nursing home when she's unable to take care of herself. I just honestly feel so guilty and sad that she feels like that. Of course I want to be able to take care of my parents. I don't want to stick them in the nursing home but at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in the same place until it's my parents' time. I haven't thought about anything like that til now, and I'm not really sure what I would even do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I have noticed is that at many Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in New Zealand, the customers at any given time seem to be mostly Vietnamese or other Southeast Asians(Laotian, Cambodian) or East Asians(Korean, Japanese, Chinese) with not many non-Southeast Asians/East Asians. On the other hand, I notice much more diverse clientele at, Italian, Japanese, Thai, and (westernized) Chinese restaurants. When I lived in Australia, however, there were a lot more non-Asians eating in Vietnamese restaurants.
 For Australia, I know that Vietnamese have a longer history there than in New Zealand, and people are thus much more familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, but I still found it interesting how Vietnamese food seemed to be proportionately more popular among non-Asians in Australia than among non-Asians in New Zealand, despite the fact that Australia and New Zealand are neighboring countries.
 So, out of curiosity, at Vietnamese restaurants in Vietnam and other countries, how popular are they among non-Asians? Do you come across Vietnamese restaurants with diverse clienteles?

We are a group of 4 planning on visiting Vietnam for a month in April starting in Saigon and moving our way North (eventually having to come back to Saigon to fly back home). I was thinking to rent a car for the four of us to be able to travel from city to city to avoid taking the train/bus as I wanted us to be able to travel on our own time and not be at the whim of bus/train schedules as well as be able to make pit stops and enjoy the scenery along the way. Ideally would love to be able to rent in Saigon and drop off the car in Hanoi and fly back to Saigon to catch the plane back home. Aside from driving inside Saigon (as I know traffic looks a little hectic) is driving a car around Vietnam recommended, safe, convenient, practical?

It was during a time when I was nervous about returning to Vietnam and meeting my relatives that I have not met a long time ago. So after visiting Vietnam and meeting my family and talking them (in English), I kind of have some newfound respect on Vietnamese language. Despite currently having little economical, political, and entertainment advantage compared to languages like Mandarin, French, Japanese, etc. I somehow wanted to take the commitment to learn Vietnamese. Despite these disadvantages, I wanted to learn Vietnamese because so that I can just have a nice chat with the locals and my relatives. It just as simple as that. So yeah. I do not know if people care enough about this post, but that is what I experienced after visiting Vietnam.

 Sometimes it gives me some confusion when apps actually use , as decimal even when my locale is set to US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just returned home from my Vietnam trip and would recommend going there to anyone interested in that part of Asia. The country is beautiful and the people are very friendly. When visiting the Mekong delta we stopped at a little village producing coconut candy and snake wine. Tried it, liked the taste and decided to buy two bottles to drink with friends once I get home. 
 My questions are:
 1) The bottle says NSX 1.12.2023., after googling NSX I found out it means manufacturing date. As far as I knew snake wine has to ferment with the snake in it for about 3 months and only a month and a half passed since this was produced so is it drinkable?
 2) My tour guide said after finishing the bottle it can be reused by adding other strong alcohol for about a year, is this true?
 3) Anyone know what the little branches are in the bottle?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today while I was sitting on a park bench, a young man approached me and asked if he could practice his English with me (I know, I know - I should’ve known then).
 After chatting for a little bit he started talking about his dream to move to New York in the States and work as a technician or customer service rep.
 He sat down and showed me pictures he’d made of all the places in the world he’d love to travel.
 … and then he went into his sales pitch mode.
 Basically he talked about how weak the VND and Vietnamese passport are and how strong the American Dollar and passport are, and how he needs $10k in the bank (among other requirements) to get a visa into the USA.
 He showed me these bracelets he was selling and pictures he’d taken with other people he had met who had bought one to help him towards his dream.
 He had a picture with goal prices dependent on your currency and for USD he wanted $32. I ended up giving him $20 (500k VND) just because I liked him and was inspired by his story given that I’m a traveler too. 
 He added me to his WhatsApp and told me that he would text me when he makes it to New York so we can meet up again.
 It was all very sweet and whether it was a scam or not, I don’t feel all that bad about it.
 But I am just curious whether you think this was a scam or genuinely just a dude trying to follow his dreams?

 I found this interesting Wikipedia article that helps put into context many of the comments recently about Koreans in Vietnam. It's a good history lesson for anyone interested and puts things into historical and cultural perspective.
 According to the article "Korean ethnic nationalism (Korean: 한국의 민족주의), or Korean racial nationalism,[2] is a racist, chauvinist, and ethnosupremacist political ideology and a form of ethnic and racial identity that is widely prevalent amongst Koreans, particularly in South Korea". 
 It goes on to give many sources which explains the history of Korean ethnic nationalism, where it started, and when those ideologies diverged historically from countries like Germany and Japan.

She never renounced Vietnamese citizenship, but never renewed her passport, and Canada has always allowed dual citizenship. Question: Did she retain Vietnamese citizenship to this day?
 I am reading about the laws and it is very confusing given multiple changes in the past decade. In 2009 Vietnam recognized dual citizenship and said those who had left Vietnam prior must renew their passport to retain citizenship. This was extended to 2014 as very few did it. Again, it seems this was extended or cancelled, I don’t know about this part. Anyone in a similar circumstance successfully renewed their passports from abroad after decades? Cảm ơn

 Also, how likely are we to get scammed? My mom believes locals are mean and will try to scam you and rob you. I just want to get first hand experience advice so I feel more prepared than through my parents who havent been back since the 90s/early 2000s!

 So I went to visit her and had a great time. I stayed with her in her apartment for five days and she basically treated me like I was her boyfriend. She spent a lot of time with me, showed me around, gave me her motorcycle and instructions to explore while she had to do some work. She took me out, cooked for me and even did my laundry. We slept together. And we got to talk and get to know each other a little bit.
 I've never experienced anything like it. She is a very attractive, smart young woman. 
 After leaving and coming back to Saigon I felt I wanted to spend more time with her before going back to Europe in a couple of weeks, so I told her that I'd like to see her again. She said I was invited again and that I can stay until I need to go back to Europe (two weeks). I slept on it and decided that I actually want to spend some more time in the city before going back and that spending that much time with her might be too much for me. We then spoke on the phone and I told her that I'd like to come again for 5 days and she got upset and offended that I didn't want to spend all of my time with her and told me it's better we don't see each other then.
 And that was it. I actually wanted to spend more time with her and see where things could possibly go, but it would have been very difficult because she lives and works in a more rural area. I'm not sure what her intentions were exactly, but I appreciated the experience.

Alright, let's overlook the regrettable human casualties in the collapse of the Vinpearl cable car station yesterday, January 14, 2024, as the media has been silenced, and the Nha Trang authorities are concealing casualty figures. Let's talk about the environment. In the video clip, you can clearly see an excavator digging into the seabed. The question arises: Is it legal for them to build a tram station in the sea? Vinpearl tourism seems to be contributing to environmental destruction, contrary to the "green environment" advocated by Vinfast.

 ​
 I want to as, do hotels offer rooms for discounted price if I rent a whole month?
 I am looking for private room with its own bathroom + wifi etc, and would like to pay around 200GBP a month. IS this possible?

 I am new to traveling. Could someone elaborate on this please?

 There's a dedicated Chinese zodiac sign to these creatures, so if anything, I assume they are instead associated with some set of universal virtues and flaws. On the other hand, biblical symbolism of snake should not make an outlandish concept for Vietnamese people, as the French left a significant impact on the culture.
 So what's the meaning behind a snake one could think of in the first place?

 Four exchange students living in South Australia have disappeared in the past months, leaving police and their host families baffled.
 The teenagers disappeared at different times in December and January and Daily Mail Australia understands police are treating each case as separate incidents. 
 In the latest case, Sunnie Nguyen, 17, was last seen at her host family's home in South Plympton on Monday, and now her phone has been disconnected and her social media accounts wiped.

 However, today marked the day when I let my guard down and someone took direct advantage of it.
 After an exhausting day of traveling through multiple airports and planes, my partner and I arrived in HCMC this evening.
 Exhausted, tired, and hungry, we desired minimal conversation, so we headed straight to the cabs at the airport and boarded the first cab available. In retrospect, it was a significant mistake—one we wouldn't typically make. Perhaps we had grown too complacent due to consistently positive experiences over the last few years, ignoring several red flags that should have set off alarm bells.
 The cab was an unremarkable SUV with a small blue sign and a very modest blue logo on the side, not Vinasun …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there. 
 Me and my friend are currently on a backpacking trip around SE Asia. We were planning on starting our Vietnam portion of the trip around the 8th-10th of February, entering from Cambodia into HCMC. We’ve recently been informed that Tet celebrations are during this period. I am personally blaming the fact that we have done the least amount of research on Vietnam as it is the last destination of our trip as to why this was new information to us.
 We have since done a bit of research and have seen conflicting opinions on how much will actually be open/ what we will be able to do in HCMC during this period and was wondering if anyone here would be able to enlighten us. While we think the idea of getting to see the celebrations would be a really cool opportunity, we also don’t want to be stuck in our hostel for days and struggling to find food to eat etc. If this was the case we may extend our Cambodia section of the trip and travel to HCMC at a later date. 
 Thanks very much

 I think it would be much easier for them to connect to customers in need of their service. There's no need to call and asking people walking by if they want a taxi or not, and the app would automatically connect the drivers to someone who needs them. There's no need, and you don't have to idle around under the sun's burning heat in hope of being able to "fish" someone
 For all the reasons I mentioned, I don't quite comprehense why drivers don't just all stop doing the old-school way and choose the digital road.
 I get it that not everyone can afford a smart phone, but the budget line of samsung for example is 1 mil, and usable enough to run Grab. I also get that most old-school, traditional drivers are older folks, who might not know how to use a smart phone. But it's a thing that can be easily taught and learned, just how to use that one specific app, when to click this and that, not the whole phone system
 I know I might sound dumb and entitled, but I have no bad intentions and really want to know why.

 From not making payments on time, canceling services unannounced, morning drunkenness and spending too much on frivolous items, it seems saying "It's Tết" (or "its almost Tết" or even "It was just Tết") excuses a great variety of behavior that wouldn't be tolerated other times of the year. 
 Have you found this to be true? 
 Do you have any good examples of this happening?

 Anyway, I noticed there are no homeless people in the streets of Ha Noi. There were no beggars, either.
 Is it the same all over Viet Nam? If yes, does it mean there are no illegal settlers or dirt poor in Viet Nam? Is this some kind of government policy?
 Or, is it just Ha Noi, being a city? Is it just the weather?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks! I will be traveling to Vietnam next month an I am incredible excited to visit for my first time! I just wanted to ask and see if bringing Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) into Vietnam is ok? According to my research, I noticed that the medication is illegal but previous reddit threads have said that nobody really cares if you bring it in, and it is fine if you use it only for yourself with medical usage while there short-term.
 If I did bring the Sudafed with me into Vietnam, is there any chance that they would be checking for that while I enter the country at my arriving airport? If I did bring the medication with me into Vietnam, what are the odds of me getting caught, and what would be the potential ramifications? I am just trying to judge the risks, I know I may be sounding a bit too paranoid.
 What would you all recommend? Would it be ok to bring into the country with me or should I leave the Sudafed at home? (My demographics are 21 M, USA in case if that matters)
 Thanks everyone, and I look forward to reading your responses! :)

They stop me while I'm walking and show me photos of very beautiful girls(seems fake) on their phone and tell me for 40 euros you can have sex with them in a hotel. I'm not interested in hookers so I tell them no thanks, but they can get quite pushy with this. Is it some kind of scam? And if this is true that they take you to a hotel to have sex with some girls, are they victims of human trafficking or something like that?

And as I can still track it down in "find my" I can see it went for a trip to Vietnam, currently in Ho Chi Minh City. The location is now updated quite often and not moving so I suppose it could be offered in one of the "official" shops around this adress:
 15 Alley 78 Hàn Hải Nguyên, Phường 8, Quận 11, Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam
 If anybody has the guts and willing to check it there and help me in this iPhone hunt I will offer a reward for sending it back to me.
 It is in lost mode and erased, so should not be operable without my ID. if still lost mode screen is on, contact number should be "00".
 DESCRIPTION: iPhone 14 Pro, 256 GB, gold, Model A2890, Serial No. ending _ _ _ _ _ _K67H.
 Let me know !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking to buy an apartment soon to settle down for the long term. I've always wanted a park/greenaries but also a lot of conveniences and 24hr stores. The Vinhomes Central Park area offers just that.
 That said, I've read complaints about Vingroup, as well as Vinhomes. Specifically reviews are saying the house loses it quality after a few years with cracks on the wall and water damping, a bunch of issues that aren't easy/cheap to fix as an individual.
 Anyone who has stayed there for awhile can shed some light for me on the apartment quality itself? My main concerns are is the infrastructure (stuff that are behind the wall that I cannot see or buy something on Shopee to replace) and how much maintenance effort it is going to take me years down the line.
 Thanks all.

 Where can I buy some? I assume markets but I've never seen any for sale in the wild? 
 For any tastefully tasteless pieces I'll be very grateful. 
 As a side question, do people wear these things knowing that the English makes no sense? Is it part of the fashion, I could see it as part of the VNese sense of humour

When this guy came over and and start brushing my white crocs with a toothbrush. I guess this is popular in other countries too but I figured hey why not since my crocs are dirty from all the walking. Fast forward he completed the job . Before that I ask him how much is it and he said whatever I feel like giving him. So I gave him 50 but I ask my wife who is a Vietnamese to pass it to him. He asked for a 100 for a meal. I'm like wow. Even the grab driver who brought us from district 7 through the jam is not earning that much. My wife of course refused and give him 50 after a heated discussion. He's even willing to hustle a Vietnamese. I mean I'm just sharing here it's not really a scam but yeah. Haha.

 I will like to be more exposed and ask if there is any interesting habits/lifestyle that vietnam locals do that foreigners may not be too observant to notice! 
 E.g. - In Singapore, it’s very normal for us to mix languages in a daily conversion with our peers (English, Mandarin, Malay, Hokkien, Cantonese) - We also reserve seats in eatery places using tissue packets to show that the seat is taken

 In early 2022, I made a pivotal decision: I left my regular job as I was feeling burnt out and stuck at a job which I didn't like and started an online business. Given the lower cost of living in Vietnam, I was over the moon with an income of $1,000 to $2,000 per month living the good life, with my monthly expenses being around $500. Importantly, my lifestyle did not change at all during this time, even when my circumstances did.
 However, my financial situation took an unexpected leap. My business suddenly started ramping up like crazy within a few months peaking at around $20,000 per month, a figure …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I’m considering moving to Vietnam to teach English. I’m in touch with an agency which told me that my passport is a problem (I have a Pakistani passport) , they recommend that I go there and start working on a tourist visa and do visa runs every 3 months. Which would give the employer the time to see my capabilities and they’ll probably pull some strings to give me a work permit eventually, maybe. 
 It sounds risky to me right now but they claim that the teachers don’t have to face any consequences in case something goes wrong. (what my anxiety heard : something CAN go wrong)
 A part of me tells me this is not a good idea, and that if I’m working abroad, everything should be legal so I’m not constantly under stress. Another part of me wants to just go for it? Believe in myself and take the risk. (this part of me doesn’t care that I’m broke rn)
 I’m also wondering if there’s a chance for me to get employed at an agency or something? I have a bachelors in Fine Arts and a masters diploma in Photography. I’ve been working as a freelance photographer. I also know social media content creation, video editing, graphic design, art direction and most things creative. 
 I’d appreciate any kind of information/advice. Thanks.

Recently we have been contacted by five Vietnamese content companies who want to work with us. They want to open channels in our network to distribute their content. We are a little confused as to why 5 companies specifically from Vietnam are contacting us.
 We have asked them how they found us or why they want to work with us and they said they want to diversify their operations and that they found us through search. 
 Our theories are: SEO, changes in legislation/they want to avoid some taxes, possible scam?
 I need help from Vietnamese people who could give me some context from the market in Vietnam. Why could this happen? Should we be careful, could this be a scam? I will appreciate any ideas or context!

While we were eating three dudes speaking Mandarin walked in pretty loudly (even for Chinese people lol) acting like they owned the place. They were pointing around and looked to be directing the employees. Both of us immediately noticed and exchanged a look. One of them was particularly intense, staring around the room and generally having a hostile vibe. He was making his sauce and one of the ingredients was empty and he practically screamed that they needed more. My wife said the employees looked scared when they walked in. They also grabbed one of the display bottles of alcohol off the top of the sauce bar and shared it. Neither of us were that concerned because we know messing with random people only brings unnecessary attention, but it was very obvious these dudes felt comfortable doing what they wanted in this restaurant. It was interesting and I wonder what other’s thoughts are, or if anyone has had a similar experience.

 Originally, we were going to take the train as we have heard it is a fine and normal way to get there however our homestead really urged us to take the bus, telling us we can lay down and be comfortable and it’ll be faster. We have always been happy with recommendations so we opted to not take the train and had them book the bus for us instead. 
 However, once we got there it was an absolute nightmare. The reclining bus has 3 aisles, which is extremely cramped despite being 5’4”, it was still too short for me to be comfortable in a recli…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit, I am interested in booking bamboo airways for domestic flights in Vietnam for April 2024, but I am wondering if I need to worry? I understand that they have some financial problems that mentioned international flights however, for domestic short haul flights I am wondering if it would still be OK to book it. 
 Anyone actually flew in January 2024 with bamboo airways yet? The fact that they are still offering flights, and the news mentioning a restructuring seems a little bit more promising, as though they are really trying to stay alive. Since we will have children with us, I also want to make sure that the reliability of the flights will be fairly decent. I know it may be hard to say, but any input from people who have flown them in the recent weeks would be great as I’ve only seen post from the last few months. 
 Thanks!

 There are nuances to the flow of traffic but driving like locals means driving like a moron. Things you never do that I learned in the two day MSF course in America that apply perfectly to Vietnam:

Usually alot of data isn't reliable since there are so many nuance situations relating to salary which is never covered. I've always THOUGHT and HEARD that hcmc has roughly about 20% to 30% higher cost of living than hanoi and the wages are also about higher to the same degree. Having recently lived in hcmc I've been hearing mixed opinions from a few people including locals and business owners who scouted to market to hire talent in both cities. Some lived in both and said it's the opposite and people in hanoi generally earn about 20% than hcmc. Others say hcmc is the highest in the country. What are your thoughts. Go ahead and argue, debate, whatever, GO!
 Btw im talking about typical salaries for vietnamese locals, not foreigners which are typically higher.

Before meeting up with my group in Hanoi, I decided to treat myself to a full body massage (as it was listed) at my hotel’s upscale spa. The women there were extremely kind and accommodating. I was given throw away undies to put on and a robe. When I laid down, she had me lay on my back with my breasts fully exposed, which was somewhat uncomfortable. She proceeded to massage my bare breasts for quite a while. I kept thinking to myself, “dont be rude this may be their culture, let her move on to another area…” but when she did, she kept revisiting that area. I eventually told her that area was fine and to focus more on my legs and back. My question is…. Is this normal in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been travelling Vietnam for the past 2 weeks and I’ve had a number of occasions where the easy rider has requested a 200k tip. On top of their fee. 
 I know it’s not a huge amount but I think it’s left a sour taste in my mouth. I want to tip people I feel deserve it for their service, not feel bullied into it. 
 I also had an occasion when in Tam Coc where a woman came along and took photos of everyone, then at the end I felt more or less forced to buy the photos even though I had my eyes closed in them. I ended up just buying them to get the woman off my back. 
 I’ve also met other travellers who have said a similar thing about the boats in Hoi An and how they felt forced to give a tip. 
 Is this common? Or have I and others just been unlucky?

 Im not looking for an agency or studio that assigns a random photographer where photography skill is a hit or miss. 
 Does anyone have experience with this? Maybe your Organisation hires one frequently for such occasions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 What was everyone's experience like in the Marble Mountains? I'm curious if my own experience was just unique. My partner and I did a deep exploration, and at the end of the trip, we crossed paths with a monk. We greeted him, and he smiled and greeted us back. I was walking behind him and asked if he was heading home for the day. He replied that he was actually about to have dinner, and then, to my surprise, asked if I'd like to join!
 This took me aback. I hadn't heard of anything like this in reviews or posts about the Marble Mountains. He led us to the dining area and asked us to wait. I could see him discussing with the elder head monk and kitchen staff, who seemed hesitant at first. But soon, we were seated with them in the dining hall.
 It was surreal. The monks were full of laughter, jokes, and playful teasing throughout the meal. After everyone finished eating, they encouraged us to keep filling our plates, and the kitchen staff even came out to chat and ask us questions. Then, they surprised us again by inviting me back for breakfast the next morning at 9am, promising it's even more fun then – "almost like a party," they said.
 So, I'm wondering if anyone else has ever had such an unexpected encounter? Or did I just experience something truly unique, a memory I'll forever cherish as a stroke of luck?

They are made in Vietnam and some online seller is trying to peddle them to me with a price tag of 200-300 USD. She’s trying to get me to buy them for my aunts in Vietnam saying how it is a really popular perfume for the fancier city folks there. A Chanel Number 5 bottle is below 150 bucks here in the states so at that price tag these gotta be insanely fragrant. I am leaning towards her being full of shit but since I never tried it I thought I would ask to learn from you guys.

I rarely even saw any sit down restaurant in that area. So that got me thinking of it was only a street side restaurant thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does this sound familiar? Yes of course there are extremely nice people in Vietnam, but I believe every country has people who are nice. This could be controversial, but the reason why some foreigners say that is because they are white (or black even), so they get the preferential treatment. Cos they look different. By speaking a little Vietnamese, the Vietnamese people are super impressed and treat you even better. Vietnamese people are a curious bunch and they haven't gotten much opportunity to interact with a white/black person.
 Can I say the same for how Vietnamese treat each other? How about foreigners who are from SEA and look exactly like a Vietnamese? I fall into the second category, and typically Vietnamese only treat me a LITTLE better after they realise I'm a foreigner (vì nói chuyện hơi lơ lớ). I run a small food business and I see ALL kinds of people. Conversely, if I were white, I'd imagine it to be a whole lot different.
 So yes, Vietnamese people can be friendly (just as any other country) but it really seem like an overstatement to say that they are some of the friendliest people in the world.
 Edit: Just wanna re-emphasize that I am in no means trying to say Vietnamese people are not friendly or ill-mannered or whatsoever. Every country has both nice and nasty people. I'm just saying Westerners getting preferential treatment shouldn't be mistaken that Vietnamese ppl are the friendliest people in the world. It's a huge overstatement.

 So in 2018 I bought a motorcycle in Hanoi and drove it to Saigon. One of the best experiences of my life. I am now married and me and the wife are wanting to go to Hanoi and do the loop that I missed.
 ​
 With that being said I am a bit confused as alot of people are suggesting we take a bus to Ha giang and then do the loop from there. Whereas we are happy to have a longer trip and go more out of the way if possible.
 ​
 Any and all suggestions welcome!

 Thanks all

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a distant cousin in Vietnam who's either scamming people or being scammed, but I have not much understanding of the country whatsoever... so can you help guessing what kind of situation this might be?
 He's a 20-odd year old with a high school degree but no work experience whatsoever, the type that plays video games all day long fed by parents. Not very intelligent at all but speaks some mediocre English. One day suddenly he's got a 'great job offer' from someone, but he says he just can't tell any details, except that somehow we know:
  
He says his job is just to repeatedly click things; the more clicks the better pay
 He says he 'will get paid' ~3K USD per month, not sure if he's lying or if it'll ever be paid. AFAIK he got paid a little, but three months in, he's still asking parents for borrowing money.
 He must live in where he works, in Hanoi. He can meet parents occasionally. So at least he's not (yet) sold to Cambodia...
 He must work at night
 Once a 'stupid colleague' revealed their IP address or something; entire 'company' must shut down operation and move physically, worrying police will finding out.
 Five people work there
  
Not sure if he's a criminal or a victim, or both. He's idealistic and naive--he tried trading cryptos with worst timing possible, lost parents' money; tried making a gaming Youtube channel for profit but got only 100 views, gave up in two weeks. Wants 'modernising' parents' mom-and-pop shop before he can help with family business.
 Parents thinks he's in an actual 'employee' of some criminal activities... I think he'll eventually be sold to Cambodia.
 What can this possibly be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As in the title. 
 I have been here for some time. I know the country well. There were times I was thrilled to be here. 
 But since the Covid period there has been a gradual decline in my view of living here. 
 Part of it I think personal - me needing pasteurs new. Part of it I think is environment - my surroundings. 
 The volume levels, trash, air and water pollution, huge overdevelopment and bewildering approach to governance has me unhappy. 
 I think knowing I can never be a citizen, I can never buy property, and things like have police doing random passport checks at my house now at 2am has something to do with it to. As much as i've loved the country, it doesn't love me back or accept me and it never will. 
 Curious to see if I am an outlier in feeling this way, or if anyone else has similar feelings. If so, i'm interested in seeing if this is just a phase and will pass, or whether I am in a downward spiral towards inevitable departure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I flew to Vietnam with a small 7 lb (3.629 kg) Yorkshire Terrier. I am trying to fly out of the country next month to Thailand. 
 The only airline that allows my pet on board with me appears to be Vietnam Airlines. When I explained the dimensions of my dog’s carrier the employee told me it was too big. Truthfully, my dog’s carrier is hardly bigger than my dog itself as it is. So any smaller is hard to fathom.
 She told me the required measurements. I have looked online like crazy. I’ve seen small kennels and even extra small kennels. I have not seen any kennel available for purchase that is under the maximum allowed measurements (30cm X 35cm X 20cm).
 It has to be a solid constructed kennel which makes it more difficult and narrows it down even more. The carrying case I flew with is a fabric based one so I couldn’t use a same style for this airplane apparently.
 Does anyone have an idea where I could find such a kennel? Would be very grateful for any help!

I think Vietnam just has this natural beauty to it when compared to Thailand. Certain things in Thailand feel forced where as in Vietnam it’s natural. No disrespect to Thailand of course. I enjoy both countries but something about Vietnam just captures me more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to rant. I hate the way the locals drive. But I'm increasingly seeing foreigners especially whites driving the same way they would NEVER drive back home. 
 Was in a Grab today and this guy on his bike kept squeezing to the right side of my grab will riding in between the lane marker, never once using his side mirror. Driver honk him once asking him to go back to his lane. He then moved away and sped. Then after about 300meters , he does the same thing again. 
 This time he gave a middle finger to the driver. I wind down my window and I can see he was taken aback that there was someone behind. I shouted at him "Use your fucking side mirror". As soon I shouted at him in English, he quickly sped off and dissapear from sight. 
 Seems to me that he only dares to drive shitty and show the finger to locals. Doesn't dare to engage when I confront him. If you're in Reddit and seeing this,, fuck you asshole. Drive like how you'd drive in your home country. Use your fucking side mirrors and indicators when trying to switch lanes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm travelling to Vietnam on the 26th January for 16 days. 
 After reading into entry requirements for Vietnam it says a passport cannot be damaged, but it's unclear what the exact definition of damage is. 
 Does this passport look too damaged to be accepted? The cover has some evident wear and tear from stickers that have been placed on the back but the chip will work fine and as far as I can tell the ID page is okay except the slightest little crease to the laminate.
 I do have just enough time to get it replaced but it's £155 to get it done so quickly and I am short on money at the moment so ideally would prefer to avoid this option if possible.
 Thank you

 We are meeting friends who arrive a couple days after us in Ho Chi Min, so have to stay there for 4 days. Are there any day trips elsewhere that would be recommended? 
 We then plan to do:
 2 days Dalat 
 Hoi An 
 Da Nang
 Hanoi
 Ha Long Bay 
 Then we fly back out of Ho Chi Min to Australia on the 12th day in the evening.

 Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. My partner and I are planning to do a day trip to Ninh Binh from Hanoi on 01/31. We want to use the train from Ga Hanoi to Ninh Binh and back. We are from the US so we cannot ride motorbikes in Ninh Binh. Please help us plan this trip with your knowledge and experience.
  
Should we buy the round-trip train tickets from Hanoi to Ninh Binh now? Can anyone please share your experience using the train? This is the website we were recommended to use: https://dsvn.vn/#/timkiem/ketqua
 Is Grab available to get around in Ninh Binh? If not, how can we get around? We plan to visit Trang An, Dancing Mountain, and maybe Hoa Lu if possible.
  
Thank you so much!

 i already searching for days now but don’t find a final answer…
 I plan to fly from Bangkok to DaNang airport and have my DJI-Mini drone with me. I saw some posts about problems with confections in this cases. Does anyone have some actual experiences/informations with this?
 Are domestic flights also a problem? Maybe I can stay one night in Saigon before to avoid this struggles…
 Thanks in advance for your support!

 I’ve been living in Saigon for the past 7 years and I’m finally getting tired of the chaos. I’ve been to Danang a few times for travel and it seems like a pretty decent spot to settle down and live a more peaceful life.
 I was wondering if anyone who has lived there could give me some insight on what’s it like and the pros and cons. Or if someone would recommend another city within Vietnam that would be cool too.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I’m from the UK and I arrived in Da Nang last night and I’m staying for a month in an apartment. Today I tried to go stock up on things like toilet paper, bin bags and some kitchen essentials. I tried two different shops which were described as ‘supermarkets’ on Google maps and I couldn’t find these, even when I asked the employee (using Google translate). Are there specific shops for these things? I also try to track my macros and this is difficult to do when eating out / ordering in so I want to cook some of my meals at home, i haven’t yet found a shop where I can buy chicken, veg and stuff like that. What’s my best bet? Is it markets? If so, can anyone suggest a good one? For reference I’m staying at the edge of the My An area. 
 Another thing, I would like to hire a moped to get around the city, can anyone recommend a good hire place for this? I have an international driving licence but not for motorbikes so I need something with a smaller engine, is this available here? Alternatively, how likely am I to get stopped by police when driving around? I’d like to drive myself to hoi an but I don’t want to risk a fine if I get a bigger bike without having a licence for it. I would also like to do the hai van pass but I don’t know if that would be possible on a 50cc as I’ve heard it’s hilly. If you have any other suggestions or tips for me that would be much appreciated! Thanks everyone!

 So far, I have listed : Pho, Egg Coffee, Banh Cuon, Banh Xeo, Steamed Snails, Banh Mi, what else do you have in mind ?
 I was also thinking to create a group to share this knowledge along the path, tell me what you think !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my boyfriend met 1 year ago and I met his parents around 3 months in. I'm Nigerian and his background is Vietnamese, but his ideals are more in line with Western cultures.
 When I see his parents we get along and I always have dinner with them, if I'm staying I make sure to clean up after myself, not get in their way and also do the dishes when his mum makes dinner for us.
 Recently I had a problem since he's going to get busy soon as he's starting a new business so I stayed with him and his parents for around 6 days. He thought it wasn't a problem but when I went to work his mum told him that it wasn't my home and that I wasn't his "partner" so I shouldn't be staying there for so long.
 I then messaged her to apologise the next day and she told me that in Vietnamese culture an unmarried girl cannot stay at her bfs house for too long and it's fine if it's a couple of days or a weekend.
 My boyfriend also stays at mine for over 6 days sometimes and my parents are fine with it, but I think it's a difference in culture. Could someone help me understand more about this and let me know things I should be more aware of? 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are in the process of registering for my spousal TRC and it's been one headache after another.
 First, we tried our luck at the HCMC immigration office and apparently the law JUST changed so that we can only get it done at my wife's home province.
 So leaving no other choice, we both had to take days off from work to go my wife's home province. 
 However, once we got here, we found out her home province is in a disagreement with HCMC immigration policy and refuses to issue TRCs, just a 6mo visa.
 With all that said, I don't know what to do this at point. I've gone through lawyers before when I obtained my TRC through setting up a business here and tbh, I ended up doing all the work. All they did was go physically submit my papers. Furthermore, I don't think I have to reopen a company just for a TRC when I'm legally eligible for a TRC.
 Sigh.

Looking to find the same in HCMC (Charmander in first pic specifically) but nowhere seems to have it. Have tried Ben Thanh market, and will keep looking in Hai An bookstore and Fahasa but still no luck. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm considering a teaching job in Hanoi at a new international school. The start day is early August. 
 I've lived abroad before (China) but have been back in the US for 4.5 years and am currently living/working in Denver. 
 I was interested in hearing about life in Hanoi from those who currently live there. 
 Some top of the mind questions/concerns are: 
 How is the pollution? Would you consider the city clean? Is there a large expat community? Is it close-knit? Is it easy to form friend groups? Are there things to do other than go out to eat/drink? What is the fitness scene like? Is there a road biking scene? Is it easy to get out of the city on the weekend for some nature/beach time?
 Any other tips/advice is greatly appreciated. TYIA!

 i am going to be on a trip to vietnam in the next week, traveling from hanoi down to hcmc over the span of two weeks. 
 i was wondering what the masking requirements are like for covid-19? are they mandated places or required for entry anywhere? are locals frequently using them? should i plan to bring some with me?
 i visited taiwan in early 2023 and things were still pretty strict, and masks were everywhere. i was wondering if vietnam would be similar! 
 thanks!

(Yes, I’ve heard about the drawbacks, but I still want to experience it) I’m overwhelmed with the different ways available to book and all the different cruises available. I’m looking for a cruise that will also provide transportation from and back to Hanoi. I’d rather book ahead of time rather than trying to go through a hotel.. Is booking.com a legit way to book these cruises or should I go directly through the cruise website? And which cruise companies would you recommend?

 from what i know, there's shopee vn where i could purchase clothes, but they only ship locally in vietnam, and i'm unaware of any facebook groups i could join where i could ask for help with proxy shipping. thank you for reading, and any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this isn't the right place fore this post, but it's the only logical place I know of to get the answer.
 When sending a longer (40-60 sec.) video in Zalo chat, does anybody else experience the video and audio to be out of sync? It's like the video is slowed down, but the audio stays at normal speed. Also the file size is really small compared to the original recording. It's like Zalo is re-encoding the video and screwing it all up😅
 Only noticed it recently, and the issue is happening to both me and the recipient. Shorter videos are not affected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are some variety shows/youtubers who have their own English sub (not yt auto generated) for those who aren't fluent in Vietnamese but still want to enjoy some Vietnamese content. (this is my first post so please tell me if I do anything wrong)
 @TheHanoiChamomile: Not all his videos have English subtitles, but I know his vlogs does have them. the subtitles do also have other languages such as Arabic, Japanese, Korean etc.
 @KhoaiLangThang: food vlogger. I think everyone knows him. all his videos have eng subs.
 2 NGÀY 1 DÊM VIỆT: This is the Vietnamese version of Korean show called 2 Days & 1 Night. They are still working on the subtitles. I believe at this moment they are at episode 14. 
 THE NEW MENTOR: This is a show about modelling. only watched 2 episodes but I think all the episodes have English subs. 
 THỬ THÁCH LỚN KHÔN: a show about little children and it's so cute. both seasons 1 and 2 have eng subs.
 RAP VIET MUA 3: I think the title speaks for itself :). they used to have season 1 and I think also season 2 on yt but now not anymore. If I remember it correctly some of the eps miss subs but I'm not sure if they fixed that.
 NGƯỜI ẤY LÀ AI?: here is a link to season 5 ep 1. I haven't watched the show myself a lot, but I know it's a very popular one.
 THE MASKED SINGER VIETNAM S2: only watched some performances but both seasons 1 and 2 have English subtitles.
 I hope this was usefull!! Please give your recommendations so we can help each other out.
 (Also a tip for those want to watch some shows with viet dub: if you have Netflix, a lot of shows have now viet dub. I personally watch kdramas with viet dub and eng sub. I think in settings you can indicate multiple prefered languages.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just come back from vacation in Phu Quoc. I met this amazing guy who works as a waiter at his family’s restaurant. When we first saw each other - we couldn’t stop staring. It felt like my body was immediately set on fire when we made eye contact. I went to the restaurant every single day, at least twice a day. We never had a real conversation but we were always looking at each other. 
 When he was taking someone else’s order - he couldn’t stop staring at me - his dad had to tell him to “stop staring at that girl & focus on taking the order”. He’d play songs that I suggested & we’d dance together - all while maintaining eye contact and smiling ear to ear at each other. 
 I was absolutely dying to get his socials & stay in contact but I couldn’t muster up the courage to just ask & when I finally did - he wasn’t there. 
 On my last day - I stayed at the restaurant from breakfast till closing time. He gave me my favourite orders & drinks for free because I told him I’d be leaving that night. 
 Now that I’m back home - I have this huge empty feeling of loss - deep inside my stomach. Thinking of him makes my chest hurt & feel heavy. I can’t stop myself from crying when I think about his face smiling at me. 
 In those few weeks of endless tension, smiles & eye contact - I had never felt happier. He makes me feel alive just by looking into my eyes. He makes me feel absolutely blissfuly happy in a way that I’ve never felt before & I’ve never even properly spoken to him. 
 I am desperately planning to go back to Phu Quoc later this year because I feel physically sick at the thought of never seeing him again. 
 Idk what it is - if it’s just me romanticising just a simple vacation crush & being delusional or if there is something actually there. 
 I feel so empty without him & it’s so silly of me because I don’t even know his name. 
 What’s going on? What do I do.. I desperately need advice/another perspective on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even the popular, must go, places have dirty walls, trash all over the floor, dirty tables, utensils that have never seen a drop of soap. My first few jobs were in food service and half the time was spent cleaning. I don't even want to think about what happens in the food prep areas. Why do people even frequent places like that. Back home (3rd world country) it wouldn't matter how good your food is, if you have a dirty establishment no one would stay and eat.
 Edit1: A lot of people are not reading the text. I never said anything about the preparation of the food. I meant how dirty the establishments are. In my third world country, even in family owned businesses, cleanliness is very important at least just for looks. The prep might be another story. 
 And before people try to pull the western standards card, is it really a western standard to have a clean presentable place to eat? What a way to devalue your own country and culture. It shouldn't be defended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I ordered a Yamaha keyboard before Christmas. It turned out that it did not have MIDI port, so I packed it and sent it back.
 Today (2 weeks later) I got a message saying the package was damaged.
 Here is the photo they sent:
 https://preview.redd.it/r8k1ihypgxac1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=b028b8e050c37a030b675390b258c605a8845d58
 This is obviously untrue because the package was fine when I sent it to them. It means it was probably damaged during transportation or even damaged by these "quality checkers" themselves.
 The keyboard itself is obviously fine, as well as have all the accessories inside the box:
 https://preview.redd.it/yfb64hvvgxac1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=65b1b48fed7bbb2e1ef38ce852b84c4f88fc101b
 I don't know what to do at this point. The app says that they will send it back to me with some paper to sign. I don't want to sign anything because this is just ridiculous.
 Is "damaged package" a real legal reason to reject return? This is not the case in my home country, don't know about Vietnam though. But hey, they could have damaged the package themselves. What should I do at this point?
 P. S., they have my return photo which I took right before sending it back
 ​
 the package is obviously undamaged

This morning there was music being broadcast over a loudspeaker, quite pop, animated music for 30 mins. What was this for? The primary school opposite was full of motorbikes and people coming in constantly. A few kids but mostly adults alone.
 Just nosey really! Wondered if anyone knew the reason for the early wake up this morning!
 Edit - Sorry if I offended anyone, I wasn't asking why people are noisy I was just curious! I did try googling but found no information so thought I'd ask on here if this was a common thing. I'm trying to learn more about the culture I swear! 😂

The thing is i got this one 🇻🇳 which is the national flag. Is that okay? I am actually south vietnamese but i thought the south flag was outdated since vietnam is no longer seperated. Also, my parents think it might be offensive because its a communist flag but they are unsure as well.
 So basically, is the vietnam flag 🇻🇳 okay to hang if im south vietnamese? And is it offensive because i dont want to represent anything that is like communism? Should i just buy the south vietnamese flag?

 I am going to Hà Giang hoping to film a documentary about the local ethnic minorities groups of the region, how tourism has effected the region and about the issue of children begging tourists for money in and around Hà Giang.
 Since my Vietnamese is not very good I am looking for a Vietnamese speaker to accompany me as a guide / translator / interpreter. I don't mind if they are not from a film background as long as they are passionate about film and creative. 
 Send me a direct message and ill send you the Pitch deck and more info 
 Im not sure if this is right place to post this but thought I would give it a try!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I booked tickets for my family and my wife's aunt and her husband to travel together from the US to SE Asia. How much can each of our family bring without declaring? I understand 10K per family but since we're traveling together and on the same ticket, does this count as a single family? I read an article where the flight attendants got in trouble because they counted as a party and carried over the limit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I travel to Vietnam in February and 14th of February I am planning to leave Hanoi and move to Central Vietnam, in Da Nang.
 Fare prices have been a lot higher than usual (95 EUR single trip) for almost a month since I am tracking them. But they mostly keep its high price, they dont fluctuate either up or down.
 Sice its almost a month before the flight, as many know, this is a period when the prices start moving and when you can usually pick a good deal.
 I would like to ask knowleable people about in this, do you think is possible that the price is high yet just because of the expectation and it can still drop down, or there more likely there is a really high demand even the 4th day after Tet (as far as I read, most of the people travel before not after Tet)?
 Do I risk that the fare will be completely sold out if I wait longer?
 I would like to hear from the people who have know how this works, please don't post your advices based only on your feelings if you are not experienced in searching cheap fares.
 ​
 EDIT: also I am wondering, about something. Do you think that if I make the reservation to the point I am selecting the seats, this is a real view of how fully is being the flight booked or not? Free seats means not sold yet or they can be sold to 3rd agencies (KAYAK, KIWI...) but yet not sold to the end party... Anybody knows?

 The boat was large and comfortable. We excitedly disembarked at the first stop at a large cave. There were maybe 1,000 people walking through the cave which meant walking up steps was 1 or 2 steps at a time. At points where pictures could be taken, there were no less than 50 large boats present in the shot. 
 The other two stops to kayak and hike were very short and had boats and tourists everywhere. The smell of exhaust from the boats was bad. 
 After disembarking after the day was complete, we thought the tour company made a mistake ( even though my wife is Vietnamese and fluent) since the boat ticket said 290K vnđ and we already paid 900K VNĐ. 
 As we left the docks, the tour company contacts us again to pay the second 900K vnđ. When my wife asks about the 290K vnđ tickets, she is told “that does not include your food”. Our food was a mediocre lunch. 
 Are we to believe that the boat trip cost 290k vnđ per person and the food cost 610k vnđ per person? Haha. Please. 
 My advice is to only book directly with the cruise line. And only do that if you don’t mind paying to be elbow to elbow with tourists
 I will get many downvotes from the tour operators but I bet I get few rebuttals from them

But sadly that I'm not a Top tier educated person, so he blamed me alot. He doesn't care about me emotionally, he doesn't care about my interests or hobbies. He only cares about my study. I know Im a big boi with self awareness. But I have no voice to raise in my family, even if I do so, I still get stomped on then get called immature. It's hard for me to connect relationship with him. Do you have any experience similar to mine? How do you cope?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had the misfortune of staying a week in one of the rental "luxury" vinhomes within Landmark 81 area. Nearly everthing was falling apart. A dystopian nightmare. I had beautiful scenic views of other apartment windows, clothes drying on balconies, and shirtless old men. The location is nice, but sterile.
 If this is quality indicative of Vingroup, my condolences to students of Vinschool, patients of Vinmec and drivers of Vinfast cars.
 I had to cross the busy street by foot (what a memorable experience as a pedestrian) to get to the other side of what I would consider real Vietnam. There I was able to get Com Tam breakfast for 35k, then walk across the street to buy pet supplies, get a haircut, a sugercane drink, and some photocopying required to get me and my pet out of Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Vietnamese uses the Latin alphabet. But it used Chinese characters/Chữ Nôm up until French colonialism. From what I can tell in Vietnam proper the Latin alphabet is used basically exclusively. But in my local diaspora community and other places I still see Chinese characters along side the Latin script. 
 Is it just because they’re such deep diaspora? Or is there another reason.

 Vietnamese bedding is the worst I've ever known. The fabrics are scratchy, the blankets are tiny, and the fabric designs look like they are from the imagination of a blind goblin. I can't believe it's possible to make so many colors clash all at once.
 My Viet wife says it's China's fault.
 Edit: This is half satire. Amuse yourself at my expense, I enjoy it.

 -Unblockable fuckers like Home Credit. They just fucking keep messaging you and the best you could do was deleting message history. 
 -Random people adding you to random unblockable group chat. You have 0 idea who was the fucker who added you there. You can't turn off that function where people add you to random group chat either.
 -"Explore"/"Khám phá" tab that is unable to be removed. The elderly who are not fluent with smartphones keep randomly subcribed for random shits in this tab. 
 Edit: Forgot about this shit too: old files keep getting deleted. They are not even that old and you can't control it either. Can't increase or decrease the time where Zalo considers it to be old. -Suggestion of random people which I'm sure 90% don't give a shit about. Like if you wanted to add somebody as friend on Zalo, you usually take their numbers and add them. Not from suggestion. That's like the entire fucking point of Zalo: Phone numbers with a profile. It's the most useless shit ever and it has no right to be on "message" tab. Like Zalo is trying too fucking hard to become like Facebook or some shit. Zalo is forgetting their original users and Vietnamese are too forgiving.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So nearly had a crash on the back of a grab bike tonight, it was not my drivers fault at all, basically another scooter veered into us and my driver steered away which then lead us dead on with another car. Luckily my driver & the car both slammed the breaks on, the scooter I was on just bumping slightly into the car infront. 
 Posting this just to say BE SO CAREFUL here on the roads. Even if you're on the back of a bike with a grab driver, it is wild. 
 My heart is still racing over an hour later from the ordeal. Absolutely no idea how we got out with no damage and without falling off! 
 Again, if you're travelling in vietnam seriously the roads ain't no joke here. Be careful. 
 Good luck & stay safe yo!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friendly people, 
 I am visiting your country for the first time with my dad from Armenia, we wanted to explore asia for the first time and my father being a typical anti imperialist leftist he adores Vietnam, I'm sure you already know your nation has a huge fanbase consisting of boomer leftists. 
 To my question(s): We're landing in Hanoi and leaving from Ho Chi Minh City and want to take the train to see the beautiful countryside. We're staying from 30th Jan-12th February, coincidentally during Tet Holiday. 
  
Is there a reliable website to buy train tickets in advance?
 Do the train stop at some cities so you can go outside and explore it during a short time between stops?
 Is it worth buying train tickets ASAP since it's Tet holiday soon?
 We're thinking of either staying in Hoi An one night and continuing the next day, is this something you would recommend or is going straight to HCMC?
  
Thank you and looking forward to visiting your country! 
 Bonus question:
  
Is it offensive if I wear those green short sleeved shirts older Vietnamese men wear as a mediterranean looking guy? I always wanted to rock those shirts and want to fit in/be accepted by Vietnamese people.

It’s horrible, it’s dirty, it smells so bad, there’s trash and rubble everywhere and I was not ready to see that much dog meat in the street. I tried walking around diferente areas in the city to see if maybe something changed but it’s all bad. I’ll go to the HCM Mausoleum tomorrow and see if that’s any better but honestly I just want to cry and leave. 
 I’m from Guatemala City and that’s a pretty ugly city + crime is bad and it’s still better than Hanoi in my opinion. Where should I go? I want to give this city a chance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been warned a lot of times about not to carry stuff from strangers/acquaintance/friends/anyone on the airplane, because the stuff may contain harmful drug ingredients. If you get caught in certain countries you may even get death penalty. Some of them go as far as using mind control to make you feel bad if you refuse to do their favor, such as using seniors, disabled people, and orphans as a disguise to ask you to carry stuff on their behalf. In my unpopular opinion, scapegoat seekers (i.e. retards that ask someone to do their dirty jobs while reaping benefits behind the scene) are the WORST HUMANS, COWARDICE ON EARTH, second only to leeches (i.e. people that can read the mood but their skin is so thick that they still cross the line). These kind of “special breeds of people” can be found anywhere in the world, from all backgrounds, ethnic groups, so whoever thinks your background/ethnicity is at play here is FAR WORSE than those aforementioned special breeds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a white guy solo traveling in Vietnam. I am currently in Hai Phong. Yesterday some guys invited me to join their table for drinking and eating. They handed me beer, food, rice wine, etc. We kept drinking for quite some time. There was also a bit of weed which they offered me and that I smoked.
 Eventually we go a bit further away, they said to listen to some music. We arrive at some small shop but there is no music. After that I say I am going home and I don't need help going home, I can walk. One of the guys insists I go with him on the scooter. Despite the language barrier, I understand it as if he will now drive me home, so I go with him. Instead we drive for a bit with me barely getting closer to my home and we get off at the center square of the city. We talk for a bit and I say I am walking home now, they suggest I take one of the nearby taxis. It feels a bit sketchy for me so I do not take a taxi and I tell the guys I will walk home. I start walking and with an uneasy feeling. There are not many people out at this time. I order a Grab and it arrives quite quick, then I eventually get back to my hotel safely.
 I am not sure what to think of this whole meeting. It should also be mentioned that I did not see anyone paying for the bill at the restaurant, and I got the impression that I was sort of expected to pay for it, since at one time the bill was placed in front of me. I never paid though.
 What do you think? Was I at risk of something happening?

 She said she asked her mom “why?” but her mom never gave her a real answer. Q. Why do we have the same first name? A. Mom “I just like the name.”
 Q. Is this common? A. Her mom would just ask.
 She never really questioned it growing up nor did any of her relative brought it up. But I was over at her house and notice it and asked her. Me and my friend tried searching it up on online but haven’t had much luck in this subject.
 Any experts that can chime in with your knowledge is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I was in Saigon - Thao Dien, there was a women being pushed into a taxi, the man forcefully holding her down so she couldn’t escape as well as locking the doors. She was fighting, kicking and crying. Everyone just looked, it was a crowded street, the taxi drove of. I ran after it after a bit of hesitation, luckily there was oncoming traffic so I was able to catch up to the car. I opened the taxi drivers front door and told him to let the women out. He tried unlocking the door but the man locked the door always from inside and yelled at the driver to drive away. Finally I was able to open the door, the women sadly just ran away, I tried to keep the dude contained by holding the door, but he pushed the door open, punched me and then ran after the women. After I got my footing back I ran after them, but I wasn’t able to locate them by foot. I tried asking expats to follow them on the bike but no one wanted to.. so I sprinted to the police in Thao dien, who also seemed disinterested… I don’t know how to feel.

 Looking for some information, I came across this beautiful image of somewhere in the north region of Vietnam, touching China. According to the photographer’s caption on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/p/Cwu_Wd6oIUV/?igsh=MWMycGgzZWh1bHVjeQ==), the mountains at the end of the image are China, and this little river and valley is Vietnam (the northern part).
 Can anyone identify where exactly it is? We’d love to see this in person but the photographer doesn’t respond our messages…
 Thanks a lot!

Em cũng có định hướng theo logistic, và đang có ý định tìm job intern về những mảng này, nhưng chuyên môn em không có gì, ngành học k liên quan nên đa số k ai nhận.

Nhà e cũng k khá giả, bame mắc nợ nhiều nên e k muốn bị thất nghiệp sau ra trường đâu ạ. Em hi vọng có người chỉ lối cho em vài tháng trước khi em tốt nghiệp ạ.

 I am going to Vietnam 20th Jan-9th February with a friend and just wondered if you can drop any tips/advice or anything that might be helpful for first time long distance travellers from the UK! 
 I have tried to work out the travel situation (grab seems good?) and it appears cash is preferred option but also have access to credit card when there. 
 We have booked accommodation in the following areas : Hanoi, halong bay, cat ba national park, nin binh and day trip to cu national park and then back to Hanoi before travelling home. 
 So any places to go/things not to miss and general tips would be so appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dad who is now a viet kieu had brought a house years ago in Vietnam for his father and brother to live in. He had to change the ownership to his father since Vietnam doesn't allow viet kieu to own properties in the country. Unfortunately, a a few years after the dad passed away, the next person to have their name on the property is his brother and the brother promised my dad that he will give the house back to him later on when the time is right even though they didn't sign any contract because my dad naively believed in him. His brother is now dead and the ownership goes to his wife. My dad expected his sister in law to then rightfully transfer the ownership to him or even half of the house because the sister in law did help the family a lot while my dad was overseas, but she retorted back saying that my dad did not care about the family at all and had contributed nothing so he does not deserve any part of the house. We are going to sue her because we have the papers that prove that my dad did contribute a lot to that house and even my late grandpa acknowledged that in one of his old letters to my dad. The house in question is currently for rent as a business. My dad and I found a lawyer through connections and he said to stop my auntie from potentially selling it later, we must first block her from doing that by depositing 20% value of the house to the funds before the court trial since that's how the law works. Is that correct? I'm trying to find a new lawyer cause I don't trust this one and I see him as really incompetent. Pls tell me what I should do next.....

 When I got a chance to travel to SE Asia (once every 4 to 6 years only), I was always buying polos from 'Ralph Lauren' or 'Lacoste' on Thailand markets. If you can select the right models and ~haggle well enough you can have good deals.
 Now I'll go to Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City / Hanoi) and Laos (Luang Prabang) and would be happy to have your opinion about it. Where to buy? Can you find good quality? Are prices OK?
 Thank you in advance for any 'tip' or information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[there’s an “asian american” accent i’ve heard people talking about, and i’ve always wondered about it. i don’t really know what it is, it’s not really an “accent”, but more an inflection or a manner of speaking that makes you instantly identify the speaker as having an asian background even though you can also tell they’re a native english speaker. even some of my friends who had english as a first language still have traces of this accent.
 i was born and raised in the US but i have a somewhat noticeable accent, cause my parents immigrated shortly before i was born and only spoke viet at home. tbh i’m grateful i don’t just know englsih and can speak viet (not fluently but conversationally) but sometimes it’s hard to speak english after a while living back with my parents lmao. for example some of my vowels and consonants sound viet. words like “cold” i might accidentally pronounced as “code” and “social” as “so sho”, “your” comes out as “yer.” it’s weird when i tell ppl about this bc they’re like “uhhhh weren’t you born in orange county…?” and i’m like “yeah lmao but my english still isn’t great🧐” i still speak english fluently but often it’s hard to express myself fully (without pausing) and pronouncing words that have sounds which don’t exist in VN 
 does anyone else have this “accent”? how do you make it less noticeable?

Mình yếu kém, ko có năng lực ko làm đc tích sự gì, kĩ năng giao tiếp kém, mình muốn thay đổi để ko bị coi thường chứ nhưng tinh thần mình trước ngoại cảnh mình hay bị yếu đuối nên kéo theo việc ngáo ngơ dễ bị đánh giá, nên mình tránh tiếp xúc con người.

And i thought I had plenty of time to spend and travel from hcmc all the way up to sapa and ha giang… but the more i search, more i reliase that i don’t have enough time for all. 
 For now my itinerary looks like this
 Feb 4,5,6 Hcmc
 Ride a overnight train to danang 
 Feb 7 One night in hoi an Feb 8 One night in danang
 morning Flight to hanoi then bus to ninh binh 
 Feb 9,10,11 Two nights in ninh binh
 Return to hanoi, halong bay or cat ba cruise
 Feb 12,13 overnight cruise
 Return to hanoi then night train to sapa
 Feb 14,15,16 two nights in sapa
 Bus to ha giang
 Feb 17,18,19,20 Three nights in ha giang
 Return early to hanoi feb20
 Chill at hanoi feb 21
 Am i putting myself into too much things to do? Tbh if i had known theres not much to enjoy in south i wouldve flown to danang as im more interested in nature and sightseeing. But since i have already booked my ticket and its quite pricy to change it… what could be the best option for now?

 I'm currently in the US for university, forced by my mother to go here. Despite my efforts to convince her that I hate the US, she still signed me up for SAT tutoring, and SAT exam, and also applied to the school I am currently studying at, with the help of a language center.

 I have tried to convince her saying I do not want to go to the US, but she doesn't care. She is convinced that it is good for me, and even more so since my older brother is also there, who went to and graduated from the same university.

 To start with, my family really wanted us to study abroad and hopefully move to the US as I grow up, considering my other relatives already living there. Tbh, I had no interest in going to the US to "seek opportunity" and I surmised life would be depressing to me, at least. So I continued minding my own business in high school: making friends, getting grades, dating. In 10th grade, the concern of studying abroad rose to me, but I was …]]></summary>

I think they're beautiful and since I plan on marrying my boyfriend I would like to embrace his culture as much as I can. I'm honestly a little shy to ask him about wearing one, he was born here and is pretty Americanized so I'm not sure if he'll think it's weird if I asked.

 Also looking for this weasel and mountain coffee. Is it worth it or just hype? Where to buy them that's not in exorbitant prices. I once bought hazelnut roasted beans (not in Vietnam) that smelled so good but was rather bland or weak in taste. Somewhat they took the coffee taste away but infused the smell.
 The coffee flavors here are sweet like those instant 3 in 1. The saigon, egg and salted coffee were the least of my favorites. Coconut coffee is...yeah unique i like the most.

 My experience below was pretty ass. Are there any public pickup spots for basketball in Hanoi? Would love to meet up for some games next year when I’m there. 
 -Sân Bóng Rổ HK Sport: Came at 6pm on a Friday. No entrance fee but zero people at the basketball court. It looked nice though, I left immediately. -Sân Bóng Rổ CLB Ba Đình: Came at 5pm on Friday. Security at the facility main gate said they are fixing the court and it’s closed. Not sure I even went to the right place though. -The New Quarter (612 Đ. Hoàng Hoa Thám, Bưởi, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam): Arrived 6:30pm on Friday. Nice one and half courts. About 25 people mostly teenagers shooting around. A group seemed to have reserved the full court for a party without playing any games. I shot around for an hour before asking to start playing 3’s. After the game ended, some guys said their friends showed up and started their own games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our hostel warden gave us the worst possible experience just now. We have a booking for 4 of us and we had a friend drop by to our private room to use washroom facilities. The warden threw a hissy fit and started yelling and raising hell and gave us a very rough time. Plus, there was no way to properly explain to him that it was just a friend dropping by a bit, and not an escort - since he doesn’t understand english. 
 He harasses us further by locking us in and not letting our friend out for about an hour. He then threatened to report us to police and demanded money to the tune of 30 million dong (which he said was to pay the cops). He also refused to get us the manager. We are all very shaken by this experience, and are quite convinced it wasn’t lawful at all. After he realised that he wasn’t getting a penny out of us, he calmed down after a bit and opened the shutters.
 What can we do about it?
 P.S: We’re in HCMC, and booked the hostel via Hostelworld.

 I’m planning to visit Vietnam in January/February for a bit more than 3 weeks.
 I will arrive in Hanoi and will return from HCMC.
 The idea was to explore the northern part of Vietnam and to do Hi Giang loop, but I understand that it is not recommend due to bad weather ?
 It’s surprising because I have found many website telling that the weather would be cold and dry.
 Any opinions?
 Many thanks !!

 As many westerns who love to explore eating, I absolutely fell in love with the Bahn Mi; especially Vietnamese Ham (Cha Lua) which I just adore so much I want to make my own. My biggest worry with creating this delectable meat is botulism. I would like to follow the recipe bellow and have all of the ingredients and equipment to do so:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXqvP7y0WM
 Is there any risks of botulism by using this method?
 If you make a really big batch can you vacuum pack the rest and store in the freezer? Any botulism or food risk there?
 I really would like to explore this but it is very new for me and I want to be as safe as possible.
 Thank you very much for time.
 Kevin

 As an Indian, I visited Vietnam recently and I noticed that cab drivers, hotel managers, tour guides, or the people in general whom I met welcomed me and showed positive gesture towards me. During my trip, I visited only famous places which are often visited by any tourist. But, I want to understand the sentiment of any Vietnamese towards Indians who not necessarily reside in those cities.

Last month I've matched with a woman (32F) on Tinder who lives in Tra Vinh. She's a university professor and says that she's unconventional for her environment (isn't looking for marriage and having kids). We've had a couple of video calls and she seems genuine and honest. 
 So she invited me to visit her at her home for a couple of days. Given that I'm a foreigner in this country it makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable especially because I've never received such an invitation before.
 Am I going to be abducted or am I being a bit paranoid? Anything I should be worried about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an American living and working in Hanoi. I'm trying to become more educated on Vietnamese table manners. This topic has been frustrating to me. My Vietnamese girlfriend and my Vietnamese friends have commented on some of my bad table manners. It's been difficult for me to try and change my eating habits. 
 Here are some of the things I experienced:
  
Vietnamese share their meals. My girlfriend told me that I should share food so I don't appear selfish. Usually in the US, my friends and I would just share an appetizer and then I would just eat the dish I ordered. I also had difficulty adjusting to this because I was concerned with hygiene. 
 Vietnamese aren't so finicky with hygiene. My friends share food using the same chopsticks they eat with, and when I have beer with friends they handle the ice cubes with their hands. Surprising at first, but I don't make a fuss about it.
 I shouldn't accept food using my chopsticks when someone is offering food with their chopsticks. I just did this once, and people told me I shouldn't do it. I'm not sure why it is rude though. 
 I shouldn't eat fast. My girlfriend told me it looks bad. I guess I eat fast, but for me it's my normal pace. I didn't have long lunch breaks in school/work in the US, so I guess that's why.
 I have to let old people eat first. I usually don't eat with older people, but I was told about this. I had food with a friend's family, and I didn't eat until her grandparents started eating. 
  
I read a few more online, but I don't know what's true. For example, it's unlucky to flip a whole fish when eating. I have a Chinese uncle who that told me about that, but my girlfriend never heard of it.
 I hope I can receive some feedback and tips on improving my table manners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Em hiện giờ đang học lớp 12. Từ khi lên cấp 3 em quyết định đi du học nên em hoàn toàn chăm chú thực hiện mục đích đó thôi - đến trên lớp em cũng chỉ cày điểm ngang mức yêu cầu của bên trường đh đó, còn từ khi lên 12 thì em gần như bỏ hết mấy môn không cần thiết mà chỉ tập trung một vài môn yêu cầu thôi. Thế nhưng mới 2 tuần trước mẹ em lại bị diagnosed with ung thư tử cung giai đoạn cuối ạ. Gia đình em ngoài mẹ ra thì chỉ có nguồn thu nhập là ba em - là giáo viên nên lương ba cũng ko cao. Em thì vẫn ưu tiên việc chữa trị của mẹ nên việc du học ko thực hiện được thì vẫn ok. Nhưng về ngành mà em muốn học (Thiết kế đồ hoạ), thì cả gia đình em đều phản đối nếu học ở Việt Nam í, vì ngành đó ko phát triển ở đây. Ngoài ngành đó ra thì em thực sự không muốn hay đam mê học ngành nào khác. Em cũng chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến việc học ở Việt Nam... Nhưng rồi em cũng chỉ còn 5 tháng nữa để tốt nghiệp thôi ạ, nên cần quyết định càng sớm càng tốt i. 
 Theo mn nghĩ thì em nên take gap year không ạ? Em ko quan tâm đến việc thụt lùi so với mấy bạn đồng lứa hay opinion mấy người xung quanh đâu, chỉ cần là hướng đi tốt thì em sẽ cân nhắc ạ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been studying Vietnamese for about a month now and I’ve acquired some sentences and words. However, I did notice that there’s two dialects/accents to Vietnamese. When I look on TikTok I always see southern Vietnamese people talking about how the northern accent is complicated and sometimes hard to understand. But at the same time, most Vietnamese songs are written in the northern dialect and most apps only teach the Northern dialect. As a person who lives in the United States, I’ve seen sources state that most Vietnamese Americans speak with the southern dialect. Obviously I would want to make learning Vietnamese as easy as possible by learning the most commonly used dialect or easiest dialect to learn and understand. So this leads me to my question, should I learn the northern or southern dialect?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! Planning a two-week trip has proven more challenging than I anticipated, given the overwhelming amount of information available online.
 After extensive research, I've crafted the following itinerary for my travels during the first two weeks of March 2024. I would greatly appreciate your feedback on it, please! 😊 I hope I'm not missing something amazing.
 I know it's impossible to see everything in 13 days, but I'd like to visit all the best spots, from North to South.
 Day 1 and 2: Hanoi
 Day 3 and 4: Mai Chau
 Day 5 and 6: Halong Bay
 Day 7: Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park
 Day 8: Da Nang
 Day 9 and 10: Hoi An
 Day 11 and 12: Ho Chi Minh
 Day 13: Travel back to home country
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, need some advice for an upcoming trip. I unfortunately will only be in Vietnam for 7 days and am trying to determine if I should change my itinerary as I think it might be too packed.
 My current plan is 2 nights in Saigon (XO Food Tour on motorbike, Cu Chi Tunnels, Mekong Delta), 2 nights in Hoi An (bike tour, basket boats, etc.), and 3 nights in Hanoi (possibly with a trip to Ha Long Bay). I will be flying between all of these.
 Am I doing too much? Should I cut one of these out of my trip and extend time in the other two places?

 I’m coming back to stay for a year and haven’t been keeping up with the changes in Vietnam. After quite a bit of researching, found surprising amounts of innovations and quality of life changes.
 For example: 
 Grab now offers food/packages/personal items delivery.
 Online transactions are a lot more prominent now than before and of course the growth of massive commerce space like Lazada and shopee
 Paying with virtual wallet is a thing
 My general question is,
 What major quality of life changes have happened the past 7 years?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! On January 10th, I'm embarking on a 21-day road trip in Vietnam. Starting in Hanoi, I plan to head to Yen Bai in the north early the next day for a 2-day visit before continuing. This region isn't often included in travelers' itineraries—do you think it's worthwhile in January? Any city or route recommendations for January would be greatly appreciated! Thank you ☺️

I did the best i can to restore our Vietnamese roots. I’m a buddhist also. I noticed most Vietnamese daughters usually get a Jade Buddha with gold chain necklace pendant. If i have a daughter i would also. My question is. What do i give my son? Would they usually get the same jade buddha necklace also or do they get a jade dragon pendant? Would love to know y’all input. Also my soon to be wife is a Filipina.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào mọi người 👋
 I will be traveling to HCMC in February for 4 weeks. This is my once in a lifetime dream trip and I really want to get the most out of it but I think my itinerary wishlist has grown a little out of control... I'm hoping people will have input on places to spend 1-2 days (or just skip completely?)
 At a minimum, I'm hoping to go to: HCMC (both for Tết and for arrival/departure) Phú Quốc Đà Nẵng Huế A cruise at Vịnh Hạ Long, Vịnh Bái Tử Long, or Vịnh Lan Hạ
 The plan is to spend maybe 1 day in Hà Nội
 The nice-to-haves: Cần Thơ, Hội An, Ninh Bình, and Cam Ranh.
 I went for 2 weeks before and was able to visit HCMC, Đà Lạt, Nha Trang, and Vũng Tàu and didn't feel it was too much but I think I'm over the limit this time.
 Sorry... that's a lot of info but if anyone has opinions, I would love to hear them! :) Cảm ơn nhiều
