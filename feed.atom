        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey friends, I’ve been interested in getting a Vietnamese passport or dual citizenship. What is the difference between the two? Can you get one without the other? I was born in VN and have my birth certificate but did not have a passport as I entered USA under my parents passport (5 years old).
 What do I need to do to get dual citizenship. Keep in mind that I would not be able to obtain any documents pertaining my parents as they do not want me to get dual citizenship. I have family in VN also.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend in Vietnam always compares Ho Chi Minh to the Taliban. He just doesn't shut up about it. I thought this was somewhat absurd and I stated matter-of-factly that Ho Chi Minh booted France out of Vietnam but he acted like that was a bad thing. His uncle fought with US soldiers and they were exiled to Singapore. He's basically grown up in Vietnam though but he's trying very hard to come to America.

 We've been close friends for nearly five years. They've taught me a lot about antisemitism (they're half jewish) and about Vietnamese culture.
 Recently, we've been getting into some arguments about their behavior and general attitude toward our friendship. I try to be as openminded and a good listening ear but I'm not sure how to pick out what is and isn't "okay" for them to say. (For clarity, I'm autistic and I cannot for the life of me discern some things as excuses and others as real reasons. I err on the side of caution and take everything as a reason but recently I've had a gut feeling about that being the wrong approach.)

 When ever i go sea fishing , the whole fisherman village is fully of trash , there is no trash bin , i tried to find one every time , but they said they dont have it , they said the sea is enless , so they dump everything in the sea . Year and year + 
 U can ask random high school kids here , no one care about the gobal warming , no one care the forest being chop down everyday for hotel / resort ( look at dà lạt / phú quốc 4 year ago , now - trash everywhere . ) . No one care about protect the nature & animal eviroment . I mean wtf they learn at school ? It 2023 already and people still throw beer can on the street
 People celebrate new year , make sure u guy check the aftermatch in the working street. It alway a huge trash behind .

My planned route will take me up north from Hanoi, more specifically NW,N&NE. I’m staying away from the “tourist cities”, so I’m aware that a vast majority of interactions will be with locals. Apart from good manners and common sense, is there anything else I should know to stay polite and respectful to the locals? Perhaps a couple phrases in Vietnamese etc etc.

 I am currently working on a fiction novel series in which two of my main characters are in a queer relationship and one of them comes from a very traditional Vietnamese home.

I do plan on them getting married later in the series, and I have some general questions about how some of their traditional wedding practices may differ based on them being both males. I've tried doing some research on it, but I can't find much about queer couples specifically. (Note, these characters do live in America, however my MC would like to incorporate his mother's traditions into the wedding.)
 For reference, my MC (main character) is Vietnamese and his LI (love interest) is white.

 I will be visiting Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam this upcoming Fall and was wondering if there are any local fashion brands that I should check out? I heard that it is not worth shopping for global brands so I am more interested in shopping locally. 
 The style I am looking for is casual loungewear/active wear, but looking for thick/plush materials that would not pill, fade, and is soft. I typically avoid any loud patterns or colors and enjoy more neutrals. Brands that I think of as an example of the style I am going for is PANGAIA, Gymshark, Alphalete, etc.
 Thank you!

From what I can hear him yell, he broken something of the dog and did something to the dogs teeth, possibly causing it to severely bleed. The dog was wimping and crying very loudly as I can hear my neighbor with his wife and children messing up the dog. I live basically next door with the window right above his house. I need to know if there is any practical way of reporting him for "Animal Abuse". There has to be some way to make him stop as I very much cannot stand the situation.
 Due to obstruction, the videos I have do not contain any images, but the auditory evidence is very clear.
 I live in Phu Quoc, if that affects anything.
 Please give advices, I am only a highschooler and most other members in my family seems like they won't do much.

Not so much the stuff you’ll find in tourist shops but stickers, keychains, postcards and prints that are made by the youth and subcultures of Hanoi. Skater culture and coffee culture shops here usually sell that kind of merch. Even “cute” style designs I don’t mind. Just want to support young artists. I’m staying near the French Quarter and the lake. Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title says it all. As nice as it might look to have those candles floating on that side arm of the river in Hoi An. I can't help but wonder whether this beautiful and romantic trash is ending up polluting the sea or if there are measures in place to remove them beforehand.
 Somebody knows something?

She is currently not doing well having failed two math exams what I would like to know is is she does not pass her math exams throughout the year do they not pass her to the next grade and make her repeat the year over or do they make her do summer school to pass the math grade? Curious as the tutor we got her now seems to be useless in helping her do better. Thanks

 What is your current job and your most recent previous job in Vietnam? What city/district is the job in and how did you land the job? 
 I'm curious for my job search what jobs and positions/roles other expats have and how you got it. Not to mention is it with a local company or international company? I'm looking to see how others went about getting their lives started in Vietnam
 If you have any stories on the timeframe it took for you, how long you've been there and what times you applied that were peak performance hours for applications for jobs I'd love to hear your stories! Thanks friends and stay safe!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey forum, I’m here with another question! In two months time I’ll be travelling to Vietnam, where I plan on purchasing a motorcycle to travel south east Asia on. I’ve narrowed down my search to two models, Honda Wave & Winner. I’ll be landing in Hanoi, where I’ll stay for a couple days sorting out the motorbike and logistics. Although I’m keen on buying one of these two models, I’ll buy whatever’s available to me once I’m there. My question is as follows: are there any well known websites, forums, social media groups, companies etc where travellers and organisations sell their/these motorbikes?

I've been reading online to see the drone laws in Vietnam but its all over the place, what do I really need to know about flying a drone? I saw that drones with cameras aren't allowed but I've seen footage in air of Vietnam? Also, the process of getting a permit seems expensive and complicated for just a day of flying, do I really need it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently an American ESL teacher based in Saigon took to social platforms to expose the truth about the rampant sexual harrasment in a Vietnamese High School (Nguyen Thi Dieu).
 1/Upon seeing a female highschooler being forced to remove her jacket and inappropriately touched by a security guard at school, Teacher Kenny apparently stood up for her by using physical force against the guard. Kenny was furious and was asking for an investigation as this has happened numerous times before with other students. 
 2/There is CCTV footage documenting the guard being inapproprate with students in his office : forcing them to undress to check their nametag, inappropriate touching and groping female students. The school board forced everyone to stay silent and threatened to destroy Kenny's teaching career in Saigon if he went on to draw attention to the case. The guard, on the other hand, only got off with a warning. 
 3/Teacher Kenny has since spoken up about the incident on many social sites such as Tiktok and Facebook, students who are former victims of harrassment by the guard are also speaking up and trying to gain traction for the case.
 4/The Vietnamese English teacher, however, is bribing students with exam points if they stay silent or inform her about the ones who side with Kenny on social media. She called students "stupid" for siding with a "white westerner", threatened various UNDERAGE students for making tiktoks defending the victims and teachers. An adult woman who is an educator is going around spreading racism and threatening minors.
 Here's a link to Kenny's tiktok : https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS86jpE2w/

 I will be flying from California to Việt Nam in January for Tet and plan to bring many electronic gifts (like 5 laptops, 5 iPhones, 5 Apple Watches). I imagine the wise thing to do is just place all of them in a check-in container and pick up at the destination. I was wondering if there would be a problem if i placed a single laptop, watch and iPhone in my carry-on. 
 Thank you in advance for any advice.

The reporter asked many, many questions. Then, the reporter witnessed a catch first-hand. They'll be writing up a story of their experience. I will share the news story when it is published. 
 I have no idea what her experience was or how she feels about everything. So, I will be just as interested to read the story as many of you. I answered all questions they had. I showed them several things that they were very curious about:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I will be traveling to VietNam early next year. I have a severe seafood (more so finned fish, but contamination is a concern) and brazil nut allergy and I was hoping to get some insight into how I would communicate that in Vietnamese if I need to.
 I looked it up through Google Translate, but I find that it is often not very accurate. If anyone has any advice on pronunciation that would be helpful too, as I find that more difficult as a native English speaker.
 I'm not sure how to phrase it best either, so if anyone has advice regarding that it would be great. I am thinking it would be best to keep it simple, just something like "No seafood/brazil nuts, I die" or "I will die".
 So far something I have thought of trying is to print out an allergy card with the information on it, but I think it may be good to get other suggestions as well. 
 Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I was wondering if anyone has tried the fried chicken at Lotteria in Vietnam and what your thoughts were on it. Personally, I've tried all the big international chains like KFC, Popeyes, and Jollibee, and I have to say that none of them hold a candle to the deliciousness of Lotteria's fried chicken.
 The chicken at Lotteria is always fresh and tender, and the marinade they use is just the right balance of herbs and spices. Plus, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. In comparison, the chicken at the other fast food chains I've tried has been either dry or cold, or both. It's just not the same level of quality as what you'll find at Lotteria.
 Now, I will admit that the rest of the menu at Lotteria leaves something to be desired. The sides are pretty mediocre and the sandwiches and burgers are just okay. And the desserts? Well, let's just say they're not exactly worth writing home about. But despite all that, the chicken at Lotteria is still worth the visit (or delivery) in my opinion.
 So I'm curious to hear what others think - have you tried the fried chicken at Lotteria? What were your thoughts? Is it worth the visit (or delivery)? And if anyone knows of a better fried chicken place in Vietnam, I'd love to hear about it!

 We (my wife and I) are currently in Vietnam, enjoying the country thorougly and planning our next steps. In a few days, we’ll head to the middle of Vietnam, and after that likely to the South. 
 However, it seems the weather won’t be that good for the middle & the south, especially in the region of Da Nang and Nha Trang.
 Also, Phu Quoc seems to get pretty rainy, which was basically our ‘end of holiday’ getaway. 
 Do we need to consider going abroad (say Thailand, Phuket - looking more stable over the course of 2 weeks), or are weather forecasts in Vietnam generally wrong? Would love to hear from you!

 I am currently a student studying in US. My passport is expired soon and I would like to renew it. Can’t come home just yet. I have a few questions 1. Has anyone applied recently could let me know the exact fee to renew? Can’t find that info on the consulate website?
  
I swear I found an online link to upload my paperwork a few month ago. Does anyone know how can I find the link to apply online instead of mailing because I can’t find it anywhere now.
  
Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am Vietnamese on my moms side and there is a lot of drama between my family in my home country and my family in Vietnam over inheritances and what not. It has reached the point that both sides refuse to talk to each other. 
 However, much to my annoyance, my generation (those born outside of Vietnam) are purposely being kept out of the loop. It doesn't help that I don't speak the language and that my family just blatantly discussess all of this right in front of me, knowing that I can't follow the conversation. The only tidbits of info I get are from eavesdropping on my mother when she is trying to explain the mess to my father.
 When I communicated my chagrin concerning me being kept clueless, my mom explained to me that in Vietnam fights are being kept isolated within the generation and that none of this will affect me, because I am from the next generation.
 Is this a thing in Vietnam or am i being told a bunch of nonsense? Personally, I would prefer to remain on friendly terms with my family in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 A friend and I want to go out of Romania, where we live, on a 3 weeks long trip, and Vietnam will probably be our destination.
 My simple plan is to fly to Hanoi and rent an apartment in the city center. After that, we could split our time between discovering Hanoi at a very relaxed pace and going on daytrips such as these: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293924-Activities-c63-Hanoi.html
 We are open to splitting our times between multiple places in Vietnam, or maybe cutting our time here short and spending a week in Kuala Lumpur or Tokyo, but it seems like a hassle.
 What would you do?

 I have about 1.5 weeks left in Vietnam until I have to go back home. I'm looking for some recommendations on where I should visit this time of the year, or just in general! I'm currently staying with family in HCM, so anywhere drivable is fine but I also don't mind flying somewhere a bit further. So far I have been to: HCM, Sapa, Can Tho, Ha Long, and Ha Noi
 In the past I have also been to Nha Trang and Dalat. 
 I am considering Hoi An. Also would love recommendations for good night markets in the HCM area, or areas with great street food in general! Thanks in advance.

 I will be traveling with my wife and 3 kids (18,16,13) for 2 weeks in March. First time for my wife to come back to Vietnam after she left when she was 6 months old in 1972.
 I am hoping to find a driver for the whole 2 weeks who is willing to travel with us. It would be ideal if they spoke English but that may be a lot to ask? Any thoughts on the best way to find someone?
 Also, because there are 5 of us, AirBnb can sometimes be a good solution. Any reason not to try this route (for example, first 3 nights in Saigon we could get an apartment in District 1). Cost isn't a big issue as I want to make this a memorable trip for everyone. 
 thanks in advance for any and all thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in a smallish town in the South, I am a foreigner and my wife is Vietnamese. I'm pretty embedded in my family and local community and I know that people prefer to handle things "in house" or without the police a lot, but I'm just at a loss.
 The house directly behind ours (their back wall forms the wall of our yard) has a woman who is an absolutely insane and abusive nutcase to her very small child, or maybe children I'm not sure. She screams like a lunatic and hits the poor child, which makes it wail this horrific wail I can't take anymore. It's honestly shameful I haven't done anything yet but I just haven't known what to do and everyone here has a very "mind your own business" attitude so I don't know who to turn to.
 Last week I was afraid that I was listening to her actually killing her child. There was a pained screaming that only comes from death, and then it suddenly cut off to total silence. I remember though that lately I'd heard a puppy, I think she killed the puppy in front of the child. I heard the child sobbing.
 Who do I contact, what branch of government handles investigations like this? Besides the absolutely over the top regular abuse, I feel like if she really did kill that puppy in front of the kid(s) she may one day kill them too. I don't know, I think maybe she has some really intense post-partum psychosis. Due to the layout of the neighborhood I've never actually seen any of them and I don't know what the front of their house looks like.
 I'm very worried and I am at the point that I can't let my moral cowardice get in the way any longer, something needs to be done.
 Can any Vietnamese people here help me? My wife doesn't hear it because she's rarely in the back yard and while she's normally a very lovely person, I don't think she's taking it seriously and may be worried about social blowback.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I just visited Saigon in November for the first time. The city was amazing but I felt like I was not able to enjoy a majority of what HCMC has to offer because of the heat. 
 My question is…. Is it possible to get “used” to the heat biologically ? I don’t want tips on how to stay cool… I just want to know if it is possible for my body to get used to the heat if I stay for a certain amount of time. I tend to sweat easily and it seems like stepping outside of my hotel would trigger the sweats. Any advice here? On my trip I just ended up going to Da Lat and other cooler parts of VN.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time visiting Vietnam in March and we will be doing 10 days in the north and trying get some ideas for how we can plan the trip. We want to fit in Ha Giang/Sapa, Ninh Binh, Halong Bay, and Hanoi in but the issue is 10 days is a little tight.
 What do you guys think about the 4 day/3 night option vs 3 day/2 nights for Ha Giang Loop? Is it too rushed to do the 3 day option on QT's website? It allows us to fit Ninh Binh and Halong Bay in a bit easier but I'm a little worried that it'll be too rushed to enjoy the loop.
 The other option is to do Sapa instead of the Ha Giang loop which will definitely make the itinerary easier since I think you can definitely fit Sapa in 3 day/2 nights in very easily.
 Thoughts? Are there any other places you think I should consider and bump one of the options I listed out?

More than likely nothing will happen to him as he has already gotten on his flight back to America, but the good news is we will be submitting the evidence to his local authorities in New York where he lives. 4 catches in 4 weeks. 
 Be sure to check your children's phones to see who they may be chatting to. I will post the video tonight at 8pm (local time in Vietnam). 
 Just like the other catches, this guy stays and tries to talk his way out of the crime he committed. It is illegal to lure a minor. It is illegal in Vietnam, the United States, and nearly every country around the world.

 My wife and I are currently enjoying a cruise in Ha Long Bay, and contemplating about our journey’s next step in Vietnam. 
 We are definitely into trekking, and the idea is to travel to Sapa, either for a 2 or 3 day trip, to check the beautiful rice fields.
 However, the weather forecast says it will rain unfortunately, and I am not entirely sure if december is a good time to visit, since it may be quite cold.
 Would you guys recommend a visit to Sapa the 27th till the 29th of December?
 Would be great hearing from you. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are staying in Hồ Tràm for holidays, in a big tourist resort. On a Christmas eve Turkey dinner, there was a big group of people, who were (almost)all wearing white fancy clothes: most of them young and adult ladies but some men, children and at least one old lady. They were almost all wearing white fancy clothes: dresses, lacy shirts etc. Except the old woman was wearing something red & some men had jeans or black trousers. They were also playing some games or giving speeches or something.
 In my culture white fancy clothes are usually something a bridal party wears, or on some other special occasion if everyone is wearing them in unison. I was wondering if this is a cultural thing for a special occasion, as they all looked more Asian than Caucasian, and asked our waiter, what was the occasion end gestured in their general direction (I think I did it discreetly) and our waiter was immediately super apologetic and kept repeating "I'm so sorry" and we were super confused, saying "no need to apologize, it's fine" etc. and we never got an answer, what was the occasion, and we were left in confusion.
 My SO was giving me shit afterwards for asking it. I never intended it to be anything hurtful or insulting, as they were in high spirits and I think it is okay in many cultures to ask simply "what's the occasion" when you see a group or family celebrating. 
 So if someone could guess what was the occasion and also tell me if I was an insensitive white biach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may be surprised to know Vietnam has a wonderful cosplay community. There are several groups that organize events year round (usually 1-2 events every month). Currently, there is a Winter Convention Manga Festival going on; it was today and it will also be going on tomorrow too! 
 If you are into anime, manga, comics, and cosplay, then you should absolutely check these events out. I have been going to every event for the last 5 months or so. I film short videos (3-5 minutes) showing the cosplayers. I let them do a pose/action for about 5 seconds and show as many as I can. 
 You can find the cosplay festival videos by searching YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I have a "Cosplay!" playlist from all the events. If you see me there, I am always happy to include you in my videos if you want to be in one. I do it to showcase the cosplay community and let others know about this community in Vietnam. All the people who go are very kind and friendly. Those of us that dress up always allow people to take photos and videos. 
 Entry fees for most of the events is around 120,000 VND. Hope to see more new cosplayers in the near future. If you have any questions, just let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am native and speak the language well. My husband and I have traveled to Vietnam many times together, visited many different regions/cities, we are very comfortable and love it there. Traveling as a young couple in our 20’s was fun and easy. This time we are taking our daughter and I’m suddenly so nervous 😫 Any tips/advice/words of encouragement would be much appreciated!
  
There is no law or regulations on car seat. We were thinking to rent a car and bring our own travel carseat from the US. Has anyone done this? Is transportation going to be a pain?? 
 
Is “high chair” even a thing?? We love street food and always sat on the little plastic stools…our 18mo will for sure just jump off and run lol. How do you handle a toddler when eating out?
 
Can anyone recommend some nice parks or playground in HCMC and Da Lat we can take a toddler to? (Please no Thao Cam Vien or Dam Sen…does that place still exist? Lol no idea) 
 
 Anything else relating to safety, health, food, sleep/Jet lag, that you have experienced please share ❤️ xin cảm ơn 💛

 I am probably describing it badly, but it's basically a long sleeve jacket that goes all the way down to the feet with a hood and possibly even gloves? Head to toe. Like a scooter burka, but waterproof? 
 Any idea where we can buy one? Maybe one of the local chos?

 Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find it anywhere in the US and the only options online have minimum orders of 1000 packages.
 Is there any chance someone would be willing to send maybe 10-20 bags to the US (compensated of course).
 Thank you!

 Thinking of pulling up to some club right after I land in HN on 12/30, then spend the next week or so exploring the night life.
 I’m mostly interested in dancing so places like 1900 is out. Currently The Warehouse and Birdcage are on my list. Anywhere else I should look at? Preferably queer friendly and more underground.
 Incredibly down to meet up with anyone who’s going as well. Have my cousins here but I don’t think they like techno lol.

Nowadays, I have started to notice that I struggle a lot when I interact with people in Vietnamese, I always try to find the equivalents of the words im thinking and end up stuttering or saying something that I thought would convey what Im trying to say but dont? I only feel comfortable to truly express myself in English and sometimes, by reflex, I just think out loud or mumble to myself in English and probably make others think theres something wrong with me.

Since he is still very weak, his family would like to find someone to accompany him and help get him in and out of wheelchairs and through a connecting flight in Tokyo. We will pay for your ONE-WAY ticket ($750 more or less), economy class, from Ho Chi Minh to Chicago. You must be able to enter the US without a visa (i.e., American citizen or greencard holder), since we don't have time to procure a visa. The flight leaves Ho Chi Minh City on Saturday Dec 24 at 11:45pm. 
 If anyone has basic medical or nursing experience, that would be ideal, but we're not expecting it.
 If you're interested, please direct message me and I'll respond with a Zoom link to give you a rundown on his condition and what to expect. I am in San Francisco and there is a 15-hour time difference so I won't be able to check messages until 8 hours from now during my morning time.
 My brother-in-law is a pleasant 50-year old and his illness relates to his internal organs (he's not contagious).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been traveling Vietnam for two weeks and had a wonderful time. The country is beautiful, the food and culture are amazing, and I’ve found the people to be the best part of all - extremely gracious, respectful, and hospitable.
 But then I came to Hanoi. And I’m baffled. We had a bus driver sneezing and coughing up phlegm, spitting it into a cup, for the entirety of a three hour bus ride, there and back, without a mask. This morning, we were in a lovely coffee shop. But the girl sitting across from us, working on her laptop, was sneezing uncontrollably and coughing terribly. She was clearly not just under the weather, but very sick. Again, she was not wearing a mask. I made eye contact with a perplexed look on my face and she looked back as though I was the one in the wrong. 
 And then a cab just now. The driver coughing every 10 seconds for a 20 minute ride. No mask. 
 I know people here wear masks. More than half of the people on motorbikes have them on. What are they for? Do people in Hanoi use them just for pollution? When we were in other cities (Saigon, Hoi An, Ninh Binh, Mai Chau) I saw plenty of people wearing masks inside, and none of the kind of blantant illness that is in Hanoi.
 I’m terribly sorry if this comes off as culturally insensitive. I promise I don’t intend it to be. But coming from the West and other parts of Vietnam, and particularly in a post-Covid world, I’m really perplexed - what is going on in Hanoi?

 Would local people be more offended if I try to speak to them in English, or use my very beginner level Vietnamese? I've heard that if you try to use Vietnamese, people seem very happy that you are making an effort and will be nice to you, but I've also read posts about people who addressed somebody using the wrong pronoun and got scolded in Vietnamese by that person.

 There are many posts like this on this sub, but mostly for people who have 2 vietnamese parents, or who were born in vietnam. these are different cases and do not apply to my case!

Can anyone confirm? I am in the US so I can't provide cash. I asked a friend to extract the wire transfer information from the bill (see attached image) but it seems to be missing some info and I know wire transfers can go bad if you get the slightest detail wrong. There's a QR code, but it wouldn't scan for me. At the very bottom of the bill it mentions "Payoo" which appears to be a payment app. Would anybody be so kind as to look at this bill and decipher for me how to pay it? I have Venmo and PayPal. I know this isn't HIPPA compliant, but that's the least of our worries.

 I recently found out about the other side of my culture and, I have been learning Vietnamese. And, I have been getting the hang of it. The only problem I feel like I'm not doing it right and my English accent comes through. Would I be able to give myself a Vietnamese name so it's easier to say while talking the Vietnamese language or would be offensive? I'm really sorry if it is. I don't really know how to handle things since I wasn't raised in an Asian household I have a lot of mixes in my family but I don't know my Vietnamese family sadly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, 
 We are expat family (kid) from Europe, living in Saigon since half a year. I really see living in Vietnam as a lifetime experience for the whole family but I must admit we are getting tired with Saigon, in particular:
 - air pollution
 - noise
 Things we do like here:
 - green area in D7
 - great English run preschool
 - good eating and services availability 
 As I can work remotely, coming to office not very frequently, moving somewhere else is an option. I need to fly to SEA countries occasionally, trips to China and Japan can happen too. English preschool is important as our kid is just learning English :)
 Danang looks good for those reasons:
 - no air pollution
 - access to beach, proximity to other nature attractions
 - less busy, less traffic
 We have been only once, actually going to Hoi An. I would plan going there for a month or so, closed to end of lease of our apartment in HCMC.
 ​
 To the point. I am curious of opinions/experiences of other people that have done this move, or have been considering it and dropped the idea (why). Anybody here? :)

I'm also interested in groups that have a focus on dance! Thank you so much!!

Or did they just wear the same thing as everyone else? If someone could help me out or point me in the right direction, that would be fab! Thank you so much!!

 It is a puppy, it needs positive reinforcement and calm correction if it is going to learn. Hitting it when it pees inside or nips at people only scares it and makes it hide bad behavior. They hit it so hard and it makes me so sad.
 I tried to use google translate but all I can find is “how to train your dog” pages, not “this is why you don’t hit dogs” pages. 
 Please help. If there is a better subreddit to post this, please let me know and I will delete this post and put it there instead. Also, I do understand that there is a sensitive history when it comes to dogs in Vietnam, but if you’re going to keep a dog as a pet you should properly treat it as one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I have a question about the exchange rate from USD to VND I have been curious about and hope you all can answer for me. 
 I know the USD rate to VND is about 1.00 USD to 23,000 VND. 
 What does VND start with? for example, when I send money to family in VN. If I send $100 USD and it converts to about 2,300,000. 
 For Vietnamese people does this translate to about 2,300 dollars? 
 That's like here in the US, someone depositing $2,300 into my bank and having enough to buy a older used car. I would think it is equivalent to $230 dollars for you and something that can hold you off for a short amount of time spending-wise, otherwise shouldn't 2,300 lasts a much long time? 
 It seems as though the family in Vietnam spends the money pretty quickly or need to ask for asistance often. So another question would be: Is the cost of living in VN pretty high for locals? I know for us Viet Kieu it's very livable and considered cheap but im hearing a family member said his daughter ate a bowl of Pho for 50,000 and one time 90,000VND. If Vietnam money starts at 1,000 and that is like $1 dollar here in US, that's like me going out to buy a bowl of Pho for $50 - 100 usd which is unheard of. 
 So I've been looking for answers on google about this but have not found a clear answer so I am hoping you all can shed some light on this. 
 thanks!

 Sapa’s temperate climate makes it one of the best places to visit in Vietnam during the winter months. The temperature typically ranges between 5°C (41°F) and 25°C (77°F).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently in the process of applying for a job in Vietnam. I've been offered a position in Ho Chi Minh City with VUS. I see reviews on glassdoor are generally good, but that's the average of all reviews, and things could clearly have changed post-pandemic, so that's why I'm here asking. I've done teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, and the experience I had with them was very different from how VUS is doing things so far with me. To be honest, it comes off as sketchy at times and makes me suspicious.
 I'll be honest, I'm actually quite confused at points. I was offered a job, but when asked to see an actual written contract with terms, conditions, duties, etc., I was told that I would only see a contract after I've landed in Vietnam. Agreeing to take a job on the other side of the world without having seen and signed an actual contract beforehand strikes me as super sketchy. When I took teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, they provided me with full-on, multi-page contracts to read and review before agreeing to fly halfway around the world.
 I also know that I'll be flown in on a business visa and do a probation period first for a month or two before acquiring a work permit and then a resident permit from there. Once again, this also confuses me. I've never had to do a probation period before when agreeing to do a job overseas, and the whole "applying for a 3-month business visa, then a work permit" thing instead of "applying for a work visa from the get-go" thing also confuses me.
 Lastly, aside from all that, how has your experience been with VUS? How was the teaching and prep workload? How were employer-employee relations overall? Was the pay sufficient to save (aiming for $500 a month if I can) and could hours be picked up easily? If on a part-time contract, was it easy to take vacation days (even if unpaid)? 
 Any and all input is welcome. Thank you very much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I need some travel related advice from a person familiar with these cities in Vietnam : Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue City. 
 I am from India and currently in Vietnam with my parents. I have been here for 6 days and visited Hanoi, Sa Pa, HaLong Bay and HCMC, and now moving on to Hue city by an early morning flight on 21st December, and my return flight back to India is in evening of 24th December from Da Nang. 
 The issue, now, is that the weather forecast shows it will more or less rain for next 3 days (21-24 December) continuously. I was currently planning to visit the Historic city of Hoi An, then Ba Na Hills through Ropeway and then Citadel in Hue city and then go back to Da Nang and take the return flight. 
 Can someone please help me figure out how many days I should spend in each city and what I should avoid doing to make the best of whatever time I have in these 3 cities. Or. Maybe I can go to a nearby city that has no rain and travel there? Open to suggestions.

 My husband and I arrived at HCMC airport a couple hours ago - we’ve been in Thailand for the past couple weeks on holiday, and thought we’d pop over to Vietnam for a few days too. 
 When we came out the airport, one of the guys in a white shirt got us. All the advice we read beforehand was about metered taxis, and the guy said that the taxi is metered so we didn’t think anything more of it so it should be fine. Hopped in and asked to be dropped to our hotel in District 1. 
 No joke… the meter was going up 25k every 10 seconds. After less than 10 mins of driving, we told him it’s far too expensive and we need to get out. Paid 600k to be left on the side of the road :( wish we’d stuck to our guns and given him less, he made a stupid amount off our naïveté. 
 We ordered a Grab which dropped us the rest of the way for just 80k. In hindsight that’s what we should’ve done when we were looking for a taxi, but hindsight is always 20/20!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all been on this forum for a while. I am strongly considering moving to Vietnam. I’d love to have a scientific job there such as medical research, but I’ve done quite a bit of looking into this and can’t seem to find many opportunities, so I would probably go into teaching english.
 I lived in Saigon for about 6 months in 2020 with my now ex-gf, and I really loved it, and ever since have been a little obsessed with watching videos about it, keeping up with news/info there. My friends and family know I love it as I do speak about it with them sometimes.
 The problem is, while I was living there, I wasn’t actually working, so it was more of an extended holiday, and I know actually working there would be much different. I have a TEFL certificate and also a bachelors degree, and actually had an interview a while ago when I was considering moving there a year ago, and was offered a teaching job, but in the end I declined it.
 Only things that are stopping me are leaving my great friends and family here, learning to ride a bike there is a bit daunting (never driven one before), and maybe regretting my decision after taking the leap. 
 I am considering taking another holiday there for around a month and just kind of acting like I l live and work there, just to test it out, but not sure how useful that actually is.
 Anyway, if you have any thoughts on this let me know! And if you know of any medical science jobs there that a British person with a science degree could get into, please tell me (although I may make a separate post about this)!

 I'm planning a two week motorbike road trip in Vietnam and I'm trying to decide where to go. I'm considering either starting in Ho Chi Minh City and making my way up to Hanoi, or just focusing on the northern part of the country. I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations on which option would be the best for a road trip.
 I'm interested in seeing as much of the country as possible, but I'm also open to just staying in one region if it has particularly beautiful or interesting sights to see. I'm particularly interested in seeing more of the traditional Vietnamese culture and nature. 
 Is the southern part of Vietnam also worth visiting, or is Ho Chi Minh City the main highlight in that region?
 Any thoughts or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several days ago, I have read two articles that are critical about Vinfast.
 VinFast VF8 Is Simply Not Ready for America (jalopnik.com) 
 180 Miles for $55k: Can the 2023 VinFast VF 8 SUV Break Into America? (motortrend.com) 
 From what I have found out, the Vinfast VF 8 would cost at least $55k (Eco starts at $59k according to their site), and that the City Edition would only have 180 miles of range, which is a joke considering that most EVs have between 200-350 miles of range. The fact that the Vinfast name is weak compared to other brands like Tesla, Polestar, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, Ford, GM, Mercedes Benz, BMW, VW/Audi/Porsche, etc. won't do it any favours either.
 In the US, with other EVs that are more competitive like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Hyundai Kona EV, Kia EV6, Kia Niro EV, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Polestar 2, BMW i4, Mercedes Benz EQB, Audi Q4 E-tron, VW ID.4, Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and the Tesla Model 3 (even its starting price now at $47k puts it at a better position than the VF 8, and that is after massive price hikes as the April 2021 price of the Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive sits below $40k), would Vinfast succeed or would they end up failing like Yugo (at least Yugos are cheap)?
 Also, how was the experience of Vinfast cars and EVs in Vietnam? Were they good or were they bad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào tất cả mọi người! Chinese guy coming in peace here.
 I was just killing some time being stuck in a Wikipedia/Wiktionary rabbit hole. By chance I found a few Vietnamese slangs/neologisms borrowed from Chinese, such as cao phú soái (高富帥) and cẩu huyết (狗血). 
 How commonly used are these phrases? Are there any controversies about borrowing phrases from Chinese?
 Are these phrases borrowed via TV shows from mainland China / Taiwan? How popular is Chinese-language entertainment in Vietnam?
 Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both my parents were born in Vietnam and are Vietnamese citizens (AFAIK). I want to be able to become a Vietnamese citizen and get a dual citizenship (US/Viet). My parents moved to the US in the 90s and have become US citizens in the mid 2010s. Some sources say you can get dual citizenship and some others say you must renounce foreign nationality. I'm very confused on which one is the most accurate and up to date fact. I am not willing to lose US citizenship over this.
 ​
 I do not want to go down the route of getting a business or work visa or doing the visa renewal trips every month or 3 months. I have a gf in Vietnam that I may end up marrying but in my opinion, that is not the safest route for myself because I don't want to be deported if we ever seperate. I want to be independent and not have to rely on others for me to legally stay in vietnam. 
 I do have some family members in Sagion/Bao Loc but I am not very close to them. I can also speak basic vietnamese, as in I can navigate daily life but when it comes to reading gov't documents and speaking on important matters I am not at that level yet. Basically at a 5th grade level.
 ​
 What are my options? I found this line in a website that gives me hope that I can apply for it easily or without too much restrictions or requirements. 
 ​
 "BY DESCENT: Child, both of whose parents are citizens of Vietnam, regardless of the child's country of birth. Child, one of whose parents is a citizen of Vietnam and the other is stateless, regardless of the child's country of birth. "

Today they didn't turn the power back until 9PM. I am looking for a solution for power during those cuts. Many of my neighbors have generators. It's a bit noisy and honestly I don't like storing fuel in my house.
 I tried looking up for batteries. I am not installing solar panels, just batteries that are charged by electricity when available. "Pin tích điện" is the Vietnamese keyword I can use without being pointed to "ắc quy" or "pin sạc" (which won't have enough wattage). Can you please recommend a good source? What is the general price for my requirements below? In the long run is it cheaper than a generator? Is there a reason most people just use generators that I am not aware of?
 We won't be cooking but an aircon is required for at least 3-4 hours for our toddler (also one reason I prefer battery over generator is due to the noise). I would like to run a fan, watch TV or use my laptop if possible. There is a fridge, would be nice if I can keep it running but we always keep it cold the day before anyway so maybe running it for an hour only mid-day won't hurt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read a lot about people who've jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge (one of the world's most frequent suicide locations) and one quote has stuck with me:
 Ken Baldwin jumped from the bridge many years ago, in 1985 (a two-hundred-foot fall that statistically leads to death 97% of the time), but the instant he did so, in midair, he was hit by a horrifying realization: "I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was in fact totally fixable - except for having just jumped."
 With that sudden desire to live, Baldwin managed to change his body posture just before impact so that he hit the water feet-first rather than head-first (which would have meant certain death.) Even hitting feet-first, the only possible survivable posture, he still suffered numerous, severe injuries to his body. But he did survive, and went on to tell the tale and live a transformed life.
 If you are ever suicidal, for whatever reason, please take his words to heart - whatever you may feel in your life is "unfixable", may in fact be totally fixable or something that can be lived with. Don't wait until you're in mid-air after having leapt from a building or bridge to come to that realization.

 I will be flying to Vietnam this week!! It's been my dream ever since 2019 to film and capture the essence of this wonderful country. I want to know from you all, the local people about where I can go to capture Hanoi at its traditional and cultural best.
 1) What are some of the iconic monuments, markets, and places that are Hanoi exclusive?
 2) Which streets give away that Vietnamese essence right away? Where are the food stalls?
 3) What activities do Vietnamese/Hanoi people do in the morning? (Do they go fishing in some lake? Do they set up their morning stalls? If so, where? (Please help with the exact areas/locations) 
 4) What are some of the events that I need to attend? (I am gonna be there on December 28 and from December 30 - January 3. I know, it's just 4 days but I am ambitious to capture as much as I can.)
 I know I can Google this but I am looking for recommendations from people who actually live in Vietnam. Appreciate it a whole lot if you can help with all the details! Thanks for your time! Let me know if you can join me for the morning/evening/late-night photography/film walks! Would love to connect and enjoy some cups of coffee together!

 I recently became a U.S. citizen and have a U.S. passport. I plan to travel to Vietnam next May for 40 days, so I want to use my Vietnamese passport (still valid until 2025) to enter Vietnam and avoid the visa requirement, but my name is different on the two passports (I changed my name). I'm unsure if I should book my roundtrip plane ticket in my old name (on Vietnamese passport) or new name (in U.S. passport)? Or should I just apply for 2 e-visas?
 Another thing is my mom wants me to renew my chứng minh nhân dân (identity card) too. Is it okay to use my Vietnamese name for that too?

I stayed in 14 different cities throughout my trip, staying for 2 nights in each city as I made my way to the north of Vietnam.

 I’m sorry if this question has been asked a lot but the situation in the other posts are a little different. So, thought I’d ask again.
 I was born in Australia. Both my parents were born in Vietnam. At the time of my birth, my dad was an Australian citizen (so I got Australian citizenship automatically) and my mum was a Vietnamese citizen. My mum has Australian citizenship now but she never gave up her VN citizenship (not sure if she automatically lost it).
 I currently have my mum’s birth certificate, national ID (CMND) from the 80s, and old VN passport from the 90s (expired). Would this be enough for me to apply for my first VN passport? Any other Australians went through the same process?
 Asking my mum to renew her passport is completely out of the question so I’d like to know if I can do this myself lol.
 I’ll call the consulate in Sydney some time but just wanted to hear from others first. 😊

I’m currently staying at an airbnb on Tranh Dinh Xu street and I have to catch a flight at 6am, I have been using grab bikes to navigate around Saigon and found them to be extremely convenient but I would prefer to use a car for my trip to the airport due to my heavy backpack, however I am concern about the availability of grab cars in these early hours etc 3-6 am. Does anybody know if it’s possible to get a car using grab or is there any other alternatives to travel to the airport. Any answer would be greatly appreciated! Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Never had or seen beef cheek meat before. Thought I could make some quick steak but when I cut it it was TOUGH. (Yes, I learned later from the recipe page that it's tough because cows use that muscle often.)
 https://www.gourmettraveller.com.au/recipes/chefs-recipes/braised-beef-cheeks-in-sarsaparilla-7233
 Just noticed while typing this that the recipe is by a Vietnamese chef and TV personality in Australia. Daniel Hong. Famous enough to have his own page on Wikipedia.
 Too much work, and not enough time, so I opted to use the remaining of instant bo kho jar in the fridge instead. Into the Instant Pot, it went.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarsaparilla_(soft_drink)
 "In Vietnam, sarsaparilla is one of the flavors (Xá Xị) sold under the Mirinda brand, bottled and distributed by Suntory-PepsiCo Vietnam Beverage (formerly, PepsiCo Vietnam).[22] There is also a sarsi flavored soda (Huong Xá Xị) under the Fanta brand.[23] There are two local brands offering their own sarsi drink:
 Sá Xị Chương Dương by Chuong Duong Beverages. Wonderfarm Zizy by Interfood Shareholding Company. 
 Sarsaparilla-flavored sodas are available in the south of Vietnam but much more difficult to find in the north. "
 What's your favorite brand of xá xị? Anyone know where I can them in U.S.? I wonder if xá xị drink is available. There are plenty of xá xị flavored drinks.

 It involved a child and his greedy father. There was a phoenix who flew both to grab goods from a nearby island (I think gold and starfruit) but the father grabbed too much gold and weighed the phoenix down while flying on its back. 
 The phoenix looked animatronic if this helps :(. I imagine there’s a ton of versions of this since it’s a popular folklore. Thank you!

 What areas of South Vietnam are must-sees? Also, what are some good day trips from Ho Chi Min?

Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I lived in Da Nang for a couple of years but since I was working I didn't get the chance to travel all that much. I'll be returning with my partner for the month of February and we're wondering if there's a unique/fun way to travel from Hanoi to Da Nang that involves seeing some sights along the way. Or, alternatively, if it's worth just flying instead to cut the duration of the trip. We'd like to see Ninh Binh but my understanding is that we could do that in a day or two from Hanoi and then return and fly out to Da Nang. 
 Any insight appreciated! Thanks very much.

 For a couple of reasons, it’s faster for the employees to make, and I like my coffee black. Anywho, the coffee only cost 12k. I noticed, that the first few times I had ordered my coffee, some of the clerks would fill it a little less than half of the cup. Now! That I have consistently go there everyday, I get the best coffee around town. O don’t even need to tell them my order, instead the clerk would automatically ask me, “black? No ice, no sugar?” I love it! Plus, this time comes around there’s this clerk that just doesn’t care about the amount he gives me. The dude fills it to the brink. Kudos to him! Let me know if this hack works for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I've been living in Vietnam for a while now, and this is something that's started to grate on me a bit.
 Most of the vietnamese teachers that I have gone out to eat with, have invited to my house, sang karaoke with, and thought I'd gotten friendlier with, still call me just "teacher" even though I've long since told them they can just call me by my name unless in front of students in which case they can call me "Teacher _____". I also always call them by their name or nickname, unless it's someone I'm not that familiar with.
 ​
 It's kind of like insisting on calling someone "Doctor" or "Sir" after they've already allowed you to call them by name, like they want to keep the relationship distant to less than acquaintances, which is fine if that's what they want, I won't have to join their drinking sessions anymore haha.
 ​
 Is this normal in vietnam? I have a vietnamese friend that says in their language they just call each other by name, but when I discuss it with the teachers they say they are just being "polite" in their culture. I even told them I prefer to be called by my name and they still say, "hello Teacher."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, can we still see the train passing by at the Train Street in Hanoi? I can see some articles showing that tourists cannot visit the Train Street any more or it has been closed or something. If there is a local person, who can help with location from where I can sit and watch the train pass through narrow Street while sipping coffee?? Thanks in Advance

Which one should I choose, and why?
 I am interested in seeing anything old and interesting (old buildings, temples, markets). If there is a mountain nearby I can go to that's a plus. Nicer weather (this will be in February). Good eating (cheap street food?). Which of the two cities is cleaner, less crazy driving and/or street congestion (human).
 I'm not interested in bars, romance or shopping.

Neither of us have a motorbike license or any experience with bikes so we’d have to ride pillion and it is a bit pricey ($400 USD).
 Has anyone done these types of tours before and is it worth it?? It seems like a really amazing way to see the country but we’re torn of whether if it’s the best use of time/money.

 Tried calling and emailing all official Vietnamese embassy/consulates with no results. Nobody every picks up the phone, voicemail boxes are full and won’t accept messages. Emails to all public addresses haven’t been responded too. 
 Probably tried calling 50+ times throughout the last 3 weeks. Sent 15+ emails to the various consulates and the embassy.
 Absolutely no response from any officials. This is super frustrating…
 She has no living relatives in HCMC to help with the local authorities.
 Any suggestions on what else to try?

 He was immediately fired from his school, his apartment was contacted and they notified police immediately. He is losing his work permit. His embassy is aware of the situation. 
 It is very scary to think there are teachers out there trying to meet up with kids for pleasures. Thankfully, he met me instead of a kid and I reported ALL INFORMATION to proper authorities. 
 You can watch the catch on YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I will continue to do my part to protect the community and children in Vietnam. 
 I know some of you were skeptical about my original post when I said I was going to do this. 3 catches in 8 days is the results so far. Again, all evidence against each predator is always submitted to local authorities, employers, family members, embassies and whomever else may need it. That is all I can do on my end. 
 Much love to all of you! Thanks for your time. Will continue to update the community when new catches come out as you may know this person. Share, share, share and make others aware of these guys.

 Any suggestion helps, Thank you!! :)

 Over the past few years I've started reading around Chinese politics and have been intrigued by all the goings on in the CCCP. As my spouse is Vietnamese, I would be interested to read any English language resources that there are about the goings on inside the Vietnamese Communist party, whether it be books, websites or other formats.
 Does anyone have any preferred texts / suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All hotels and flights are already paid for. Just need cash to spend on food, activities, souvenirs, tips and taxi transport. I’ll be in HCMC/ Phu Quo/ Da Nang/ Phnom Penh/ Siem Reep & Hanoi. Anyone think $1000 US is enough to have a good trip or is $1500 US more reasonable to spend ? Roughly 16 days in Vietnam and 5 nights in Cambodia. I want to be able to buy whatever I want/need without having to worry (ex. Go to fancy restaurants and order King Crab). For all I know, maybe $1500 US isn’t enough for the lifestyle I’m going for. First time traveller to Vietnam, any thoughts or tips would help :) and yes, I know that it’s best to bring crisp new $100 US bills + every hotel I’m staying at has breakfast included.

 Please recommend a dermatologist and if possible give me an idea of what to expect to pay. I need to make sure I have enough money. 
 Even if I go back to US now, I don't think my insurance would pay for it.

They would ask for coffee money of 10 dollars per person after assistance. Is this legitimate? 
 Do they split the money with the airport officers guarding (they check to make sure you have a boarding pass/passport-not the ticket agent of the airline) the entry door of departure? Any experience with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, my wife got a job in Vietnam. We are moving there at the end of the month. I am trying to figure out how much money we will need to bring and how (cash, card, etc?).
 Does it make sense to exchange USD to VTN Dong is US and already come with Dong? Do we bring cash and try to exchange it instead? What is the best move? 
 As i understand, she will be able to open a bank account there once she has her work visa done. With that said, we will have substantial spending for first month and she won't get paid until the end of the month (finding apartment, 2 months deposit plus first months rent, food, necessities etc). I am thinking we need to bring enough USD cash with us otherwise we will get destroyed with foreign exchange fees? I also read there are limits on daily withdrawals? Is it feasible to bring USD and exchange it at gold shops? Is there a limit how much they will exchange? What about airports?
 ​
 Any advice or ideas would be appreciated it.
 ​
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to Vietnam for a business trip and I wonder if there are places that play metal (not iron maiden and judas priest more like black, death metal that you think cats are giving birth in your basement type of metal) or other alternative genres like gothic rock, punk, post punk etc in Hanoi/Saigon. Live shows with local bands, too
 I will be around 3 weeks in each place (if that matters).
 Or even places where alternative people gather. I have an alternative look when I don't work, and I feel more comfortable when I hang out with other local alternative people rather than strolling the cities idly in my gothic attire. Especially being an alternative woman, it can be kind of alienating.
 I don't speak Vietnamese even though I'm trying to learn some basics in order to be able to communicate with local people if that matters too :P
 Thank you!

I have a top box for my motorbike and go around Saigon once a week passing out waters and food. Every week, I try and go to a different district and look for those in need especially the kids who are working on the street corners just trying to help their families. 
 If anyone has a top box and lives in Saigon as well and wants to go out with me sometime it is truly a rewarding experience. The smiles and gratitude stick with you and make every day meaningful. Please reach out to me via messenger and maybe we can get a group going. I have been doing this for around 12 weeks straight and will continue to do it, but would be cool to get a little group going.

I think these kids were Hmongs, did not have european traits (just Vietnamese with blond hair).

Have already found a Vietnamese business partner I can trust, so I don't mind if I don't own the company on paper? Doesn't need the business to thrive, just want it to run on itself so it can sponsor my business visa.

I had learned through online resources the way you hi to people is “Xin chào” for formal and just “chào” for informal. I took Spanish the last two years of school and had learned to use “usted” to say “you” formally to people older than you or to higher-ups, so I assumed I would use “Xin chào” to greet my family. When my dad picks me up from school, I began to greet him with “Xin chào,” but recently he told me I would actually say “Con chào ba” to greet him or anyone else (pronouns changing depending on person). I was curious if that was a regional thing (my dad is from south vietnam but my bà nội is from north vietnam/south china) or if that’s a general thing among all vietnamese people?

 Does anyone know of any war memorials in Saigon that aren't in museums. I've tried searching but have not found any results that don't direct me to the War Remnants Museum. Is this on purpose?
 How do the residents of Saigon commemorate the war or is it a subject they much rather not discuss? (The Vietnamese war is something I have only recently found out about so please excuse my ignorance)
 Any help is greatly appreciated and if this is not the place to ask please direct me to the correct thread.

 Will be in Da Nang during Tet and my friend who is living in Vietnam said that everything will be closed and be ready to buy some noodles beforehand so you would have something to eat. He lives in Hanoi though, so I was wondering if everything is closed in Da Nang also?
 If this is not the thing in Da Nang, then where could I get information on what is happening and when?

 I'm Canadian and my hubby is Vietnamese. We're going back to Vietnam and its been so long. Particularly we are spending some time up North this time, our first stop is to land in Hanoi for a week.
 Can anyone recommend me and FOODIE hot spots? Ideally places local go - inexpensive, delicious foods not to miss out on. 
 I'm reading up on Bun Cha is pretty exclusive to Hanoi... also the dill fish noodles?
 Let's go, lets chat Hanoi food!

 I just wanted to ask for some book recommendations for my Vietnamese mom. She basically does not read, just a typical Facebook mom haha. Her memory is getting a bit worse so I want her brain to keep sharp with a bit of reading.
 I was thinking some very easy read, maybe like some romance novel or any interesting thriller, action, drama. Those are at least the kind of movies I see her watching, so I think that genre would be good.
 Also I’m currently moving between Germany and Czech Republic, do you know what is the best way to even get books in Vietnamese? I was googling, but I always just get the translated version and not the Vietnamese:( 
 Thanks!

 So I’m freaking out a little as I’ve booked seperate flights with a self transit to get back home from Cambodia with Cambodia Angkor air to Ho Chi Minh and then the final stretch with Vietnam airlines to Australia tomorrow and I didn’t realise that I might have needed an e-visa to collect my baggage and continue on with my journey. 
 Has anyone ever done this before or might know exactly what we can do in terms of getting a transit visa to get home? 
 I’m currently riding on getting my luggage as carry on and doing an online check in so there will be no need to actually go past the immigration area. 
 If anyone has any advice I’ll be really grateful. This is causing me a fair amount of stress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Duolingo, and I've picked up a (very little) bit from just living here ... I can buy food, deal with money, understand classroom commands etc. Obviously, I'm a teacher. I also generally can understand what topic people are talking about, but not what they're saying, if that makes sense.
 My issue with Duolingo is that I like knowing what I'm learning, not just guessing. As in, I'd like to know the grammar rules and stuff. I know not everyone learns that way, but I quite like to learn theoretically! This will be my fourth language to learn, so I feel like I have an idea of how I best learn. (I am not fluent in my third, but have learnt enough to get by in simple situations, which is kind of what I'm aiming for here).
 I am thinking of asking one of the Vietnamese teachers I work with for a lesson once a week but my schedule doesn't allow time for much more. Self study would be ideal for me, especially reading, grammar and vocab. I have lots of short pockets of time to kill between lessons. I have a handle on most of the tones, but that's what I would focus on with an in person teacher (tones, pronunciation etc).
 Any resources to recommend? I'd greatly appreciate it :) 
 Cảm ơn bạn bè!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a tour or tour guide in Saigon that is interested in discussing the political history of VietNam and Ho Chi Minh from a socialist/communist perspective.
 I understand that looking for a tour like this in English might be unpopular/lacking because a lot of western opinions on these perspectives are neutral to negative, thus they probably don't want to do these tours. I also feel that most tours and guides around the world play it very safe and conduct their tours in the most uncontroversial or unchallenging ways possible, which can be problematic for someone who wants to hear about a problematic or contested period of history. I've even been on a few tours in Central Europe (ahem Hungary) that went far the other way with very conservative nationalistic and revisionist recollections of historical moments, but I feel it's difficult to find guides or tours with a collectivist mentality.
 Does anyone have any tours or guides they can recommend to me for January? Or am I thinking too hard about this, and maybe the average Vietnamese guide does feel this way and want to share about their country through this lens? I just don't want a guide that gives me a Wikipedia summary of Saigon's political/social history because they think it's what I want to hear.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am curious how popular it is for girls to dye their hair in Vietnam and if the elders were to complain if the girls dye their hair brown, blonde, red, blue, pink, etc?
 In my family (all Vietnamese, living in the US), my 85 year old uncle (aunt's husband) really hates hair dye to the point where if one of his family members dye their hair (ex. my cousin), he would yell at them. My cousin dyed her hair blonde and she ended up being scorned by him. He told her "you look very ugly with the hair dye. Please un-dye the hair".
 His daughter had cancer and had to undergo chemo and because she lost her hair, she decided to buy a wig. I think she went with the black hair wig because if she went with blonde, her father would disown her.
 Also, for some of my cousins (part of the uncle and aunt's side), they brainwash their children not to dye their hair. They say that not only does hair dye look ugly (even brown or blonde hair because one part is light and the other is dark), it causes cancer as well. According to them, if their children dye their hair, they will get grounded (maybe even spanked) and they might get disowned by the family because they are seen as 'rebellious'.
 I definitely don't view that way and I view hair dye as a person's identity and personality.

Should I be asking for a script for some ritalin instead to take with me as it's not an amphetamine?

THe weather updates we find for the last and next weeks look very wet and we've found a video of flooded streets in Hoi An. I know it is Typhoon season in this area now, but is it expected to get any better by then? We would be planning to do outdoors activities like visiting temples and beaches and possibly snorkeling or scuba diving but none of them seem like good options if the weather is as bad as it is now.
 Would it be better to spend less time in this area and go to Mui Ne, Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta for 2 weeks instead of one? Maybe spend some time in Dalat?

I don't like to book excursions in advance, but should I? For example is it better to book a Ha Long bay cruise when i fly to Saigon? Or reserve in advance? I went with my wife last time and this time going with my parents, sister, and her husband. Are there a lot of options in typical tourist cities for 3 bedrooms or just book separate rooms? Not sure which would be cheaper and availability.

 We are due to go HCMC this weekend for 4 days and are worried that the weather in HCMC looks really hot for the kids (31c). They are ok in Phu Quoc but we are next to the sea in a resort.
 We were wondering what is the weather actually like in HCMC during the day and evening? Bearable or not?
 Also tips for stuff to do would be good taking the weather into account!

In the duration of my stay, the department of education in Yen Bai didn’t grant me the work permit because they were confused about my BA which is a degree in English Language Teaching. Therefore, I’ve started looking for a job in Hanoi but my visa is about to expire. 
 During one of my interviews, an employer told me that I had to do a visa run because I don’t have a work permit. Is this correct or are there any ways that the employer may not know about? If it is correct, what is the cheapest way to do a visa run? I’ve done research about it and found some information but if there is anyone here who knows about this stuff or has had a personal experience like this, I would like to hear from them cause I’m in a dire situation. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

 As for transportation, since public transportation is quite limited in HCMC compared to places like Boston, NYC, Washington DC, San Francisco, Europe, Moscow (used to live/study in Moscow before moving to the US, so I know the public transit situation in Russia), etc, I think I might either rent a car or use a motorcycle to get around.
 Since I typically don't use taxicabs when I was in Vietnam when I was young, instead, parents drove me around Vietnam in their car, I don't know how much taxis between HCMC and Binh Duong cost (my mother's siblings live in Binh Duong by the way), so I think I might either rent a car or a motorbike.
 In Vietnam (my home country and country of birth), I am planning to be there for around 2 weeks, and from what I have seen on Kayak, Google, etc, there are not so many traditional rental providers in HCMC Vietnam (eg. Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, etc). With that said, since I wanted to go around HCMC, go to Binh Duong, and maybe go to Nha Trang and back (I am planning to go there by myself), should I buy a motorbike or should I rent a car?
 I am also curious about road conditions in Vietnam if they are any good or not (things change a lot in three years as Vietnam is quickly developing) and plus, are trains/buses any good or should I just stick with the motorbike and the car?

 I’ve lived in Vietnam 6+ years and have had many Vietnamese teachers, but I’ve finally found one I really enjoy learning from. 
 I used to learn from her in person in Vietnam but now I just learn on zoom. 
 I recommended her to another person here on Reddit who just gave me feedback about how great she is so I thought I’d try to get her a few more students by advertising here. I get nothing from this except I just want to support her. 
 She makes custom lessons depending on what you want to learn and you’re learning style. She’s an actual teacher in Vietnam but luckily she teaches Vietnamese to foreigners (or viet kieu) with more of a western style … if you know what I mean 😂
 I think she charges about 14-16 dollars per hour. 
 Please send me a message for her contact info. Thanks

 what i had seen is we are not restricted to anything. and we are really free to do anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In short I'll be in Vietnam for a month and am looking to keep up my fitness. Guessing the humidity's gonna be tough to adjust to at first so I'll start off aiming for 5km runs (at a slower pace than usual) and see how I go from there. 
 Any suggestions are welcome. Looking to avoid crowds and traffic where possible so my image is that (for example) a trail run or a loop around a big park/lake would be ideal. 
 Open to tips on hydration and prep as well (including some food that's gonna go down well as I'm not a massive fan of Vietnamese cuisine outside ban xeo, a simple pho (no 'special' ingredients), banh hoi and fresh fruit/veg. 
 I've never run in Vietnam but I've run during Japanese summers and am picturing something pretty similar in terms of humidity (i.e. I had to do shorter distances at slower speeds otherwise I'd get exhausted/dehydrated really quickly). Looking forward to adding a few solid Vietnamese runs to my Strava and (hopefully) improving my conditioning through this. Don't wanna use the humidity as an excuse to get fat/lazy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the news, he went to a house in D2 because his friend texted him about somebodyhaving a heart attack inside a complex building. 
 JMG got stopped by an elderly man (acting as the security guard of the building), he tried to explain to the guard that he is a doctor and there's a person dying inside. The guard didn't let him go inside because this is a private property, not a complex building. JMG was very agitated at this refusal so the guard tried to keep his distance, JMG chased the guard down and scrub him by the neck like an animal, push him back to the house, pote tially smack him a couple of time and tell him to open the door. A local man then came out and explain to JMG in English that he is the owner of this building, there's no other person inside and he is making a big mistake. 
 JMG friends arrived and admit they gave him the wrong address then rush inside another house to save a dying man. The police arrived at the scene later and JMG was very uncooperative, refuse to admit that he was assaulting an elderly man and insult them. 
 Now JMG is running a public relation campaign, trying to pay the press about how his actions are just, that everything he did was trying to save a man from heart attack, and he just a bit strong handed with the guard.

 I dont remember the plot but i was maybe in the 1920s. The actors were dressed in suits and fedoras and equiped with handguns. Cound be something towards mafia,crime war or even japanese occupation.
 The opening or ending song was something similar to "Bella Ciao" 
 Chinese version on YT: Bella ciao
 It always aired everyday at 10pm or even later
 Take my description with a grain of salt because some of it could be straight up bullshit
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi again to this great, responsive community! 
 I'm writing to see if anyone can recommend a bakery that makes colorful/detailed cakes (this one is for a birthday, but any beautiful cakes are welcome) in Saigon?
 I saw some pictures elsewhere of dragon cakes, and others responding that cakes with zodiac characters are popular in Vietnam, but these types of bakeries and cakes don't show up when I try to search for them. I'm not really interested in European/western flavors or designs or characters, I hope to find something generally like this. 
 I can't speak Vietnamese so phone communication might be difficult, but of you know any such bakeries with an email address, I can surely translate a request and send it on to them. Thanks for any recommendations you may have!
 Edit: I did see that someone wrote bakeries like Givral may have something like this, but I didn't see options on their website so I wonder if such cakes just aren't posted online?

First of all, do we have any rights if the accomodation is a scam or the rooms are bait-and-switch? I am guessing not. Second, I can't seem to be able to reach the booking.com customer service. All the time the response comes from the host. Third, the system didn't take my card details, but cancellation is not possible(well, you can cancel but at a cost of the reservation)
 Not sure if this is the norm in Vietnam or some sort of scam/bait and switch operation??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! My partner and I are in Vietnam for the first time and have some questions about Ha Long Bay if anyone could please advise? 
  
Firstly, as someone who can feel seasick on rough water am I likely to feel ill on a cruise, especially overnight? Or are the waters so still that boats are barely rocking? 
 
Secondly, we are trying to decide between Ha Long Bay or Lan Ha Bay. Which would you recommend for a first timer? Seems like Ha Long Bay is a little more spectacular and can walk inside caves but super duper touristy, Lan Ha Bay slightly less touristy but a little less grand? Or is it just worth it to go to both?
 
Is it worth it to stay on Cat Ba? It seems like we'd have a slightly less hectic experience if we spent a couple of days on Cat Ba and did some hiking or kayaking, is it worth going to? 
 
Is there easy to access and regular public transport from the North of Cat Ba where the ferry drops off to the South where hotels are? Apparently there are buses and taxis bit not sure how easy they are to get or how regular.
 
 Thanks for any help! :)

 Is this true? Should I postpone my travel? I'll be be traveling to Da Nang Sapa Hanoi Ninh Binh.
 Also, I hear that train street is closed for tourist, so can we atleast go and have coffee at the shops or it's completely closed?
 Any suggestions and tips will be helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. Me and my husband are traveling to Ho Chi Minh City 16th of Jan 2023, were we will spend 3 days before flying to Phu Quoc 20th and staying there for 11 days. We are mostly traveling to Vietnam for the food, culture and to just enjoy the weather and the beaches. I have 3 questions. 1. Should we be worried that tet starts 22nd of Jan, if we want to visit local restaurants and museums in Ho Chi Minh City? 2. Do you have any recommendations for authentic Vietnamese food in any of those places? 3. What are some must see places in Phu Quoc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, I'm part of a team that is building a new crypto wallet app. Our aim is to make crypto simple to use. We previously built a consumer app that scaled to 500million+ users so we have good experience building for mainstream consumers. 
 We just opened up a waitlist to onboard early users as beta testers at getcode.com
 Our goal is to get 10 people from every country on the waitlist. There's a good early Vietnamese community growing so I wanted to post here and see if others might be interested. You can sign up directly at getcode.com and feel free to send me a message as well if you have any thoughts/questions. 
 Would love to get you on Code when we start rolling out and get your feedback.

I am on a visit in Vietnam after a very long time (last time I was here was when I was a small kid). Basically, I am visiting all my close and not so close relatives and most of my aunties and uncles are giving me money as a gift. What is the etiquette in Vietnam about accepting/refusing such gifts? I really appreciate their love and I am thankful they want to gift me money, but I don't really need money. For me it's enough that I can meet them and spend time with them after such a long time. They all come from wealthier backgrounds so they are gifting me large amounts of money (in the range of hundreds of dollars basically), I would prefer to refuse the money - is that acceptable in Vietnam or is it a taboo and I have to accept the money gifts? Thank you

 Or would any of you recommend the public buses in HCMC? I've checked Google maps, and the places I want to visit are only about 3-4 stops away from my accommodation.

 https://youtu.be/RN8IWPsuFE8
 I read the comments I thought it was friendly phrase used by Vietnamese that see Laos as friends/brothers but then I looked it up only and some source I found makes it sound more of a derogatory term to lower class Vietnamese. So what does Đông Lào really mean?
 Side note: Thai use the phrase West Vietnam, Lao-Kaew or Lao-Dang to Lao people as a derogatory term for those who are mixed with Viet or those embrace Lao-Viet brotherhood. Many Thai believe the Lao government is a puppet to Vietnam. And that the Lao government teaches their people to hate Thai and love Viet more. The truth is Thai has done more damage to the people of Lao for centuries. Link below if you want to read about Thai-Lao history

 I currently have booked a tour of Hang En 2D/1N with Oxalis adventures for around $300. I was thinking of booking something with Jungle Boss tours of Elephant cave and Ma Da Valley where we would hike and swim through caves in one day ($65). Side note: I'm planning on doing a motorbike tour after that will bring me from Phong Nha to Khe Sahn to Hue and then to Da Nang/Hoi An over 3 days (~$210). 
 The Hang En tour is the most expensive thing I'm doing on my trip so I'm trying to figure out whether I can get a very similar experience by seeing a different cave. I've never really explored any caves so I'm not sure what to expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 Any suggestions on whether I should stay in Da Nang or Hoi An? It seems like there is no consensus on Hoi An, some people say it should only be a day trip and other people wish they had spent more time there. I have a mid-budget and care most about trying great food, having unique accommodations, beautiful scenery, and being able to go on cool day tours. I'm not interested in shopping so Hoi An does not sound very appealing. I fly out of Da Nang which is why I thought it would make sense to stay there and make a day trip to Hoi An. It also seems like similar tours are offered from each location. 
 My rough itinerary is as follows: Hanoi - 2 nights; Ha Long Bay - 2D/1night then bus to Ninh Binh - 1 night, overnight bus to Phong Nha - 4 nights then train to Hue - 1 night; then easy rider to Da Nang/Hoi An - 2 nights.

How do I agree with someone in an informal way and not sound too formal, especially to people who I refer to as "em"? Is "Dạ" and "Vâng" too formal? While "Ừ" or "À" kinda seems too inappropriate and informal.
 
What does "nek" and "nè" mean? I read somewhere that these are the same, but I still don't really know what they exactly mean.
 
What is the difference between "nha" and "nhé"?
 
What is the difference between "rùi" and "rồi"
 
Is "á", "ợ", "ah" at the end of the sentence the same as "ạ"? Why not just use "ạ" if it is the case.
 
I'd like to know more shortforms which are very common in chatting. It would be great if you guys could name me some.
 
 My goal is to become more natural and fluent in vietnamese. Hope someone can help. Thanks in advance. :)

 Long story short, I was put up for adoption to live a better life in America when I was 2 (mistake child, have 2 biological brothers 10+ years older than me). I grew up in a great family in the states, but I’ve always wanted to go find my biological family. Right before COVID I traveled to Vietnam for 30 days to try and find my family. I found them after a few days and lived with them for the remainder of my time there and I’ve gotten very close to them these past couple years.
 I am going to visit them here soon for Tet and want to give them money and gifts. How much money should I give them (enough to be generous, but not enough for them to rely on me)? And what gifts should I bring? My two brothers have 2 kids each and they are all mid-teens, so I bought each family laptops for school / college. I was thinking candy? I had a bunch of candy that I had brought last time and the kids loved it. 
 Thanks in advance!

 So I’m basically asking is hông ever used (outside of hông biết) ? Is it just an alternative pronunciation of không?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I'm somewhat pretty interested on the conflict called the Vietnam War, I watched/read quite a few things about it and I used to live in HCMC. The documentary of Ken Burns was super interesting but to me it lacks of the Vietnamese people's experience at the time. If you have some ressources to share about it (even in Vietnamese language) I would be grateful :)
 The conflict with the french is interesting too, if you have anything about it please send it my way. Peace.

When I was there I didn’t mind the heat as much but I noticed my relative sweating bucket when they came back to visit. Now that I lived in US for majority of my life and finally decide to come back, I figured I’m gonna struggle from the heat, so what can I do about it? 
 Also what is the best place in vietnam with the best weather? One of my destination is Hoi An for a wedding but I’m open to suggestion for more places as I haven’t really planned the trip out yet.
