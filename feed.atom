        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I met a very nice lady. She's very sweet, and we can have conversations for hours. She dresses nice, exercises, and eats healthy. She's very classy and everything seems great except she chews with her mouth open. And not a little, a lot. We had lunch yesterday and she didn't even try to keep it closed, and talked a lot with food in there. If I were to mention this to her, she might consider it losing face and would probably ghost me.
 How can I get a nice lady to chew with her mouth closed?

My wife can drive for a year with an IDP but eventually we plan to get a driver license for both of us. I am Vietnamese and my wife is not but she can communicate in Vietnamese decently.
 For me, I know absolutely nothing about driving a car (or about a car itself). I also want to learn to drive decently and safely and we will not bribe. What can we do to prepare ahead? I heard there are some test apps online, does it make sense for me to learn them first before actually get to class? TIA.

 I'm heading to VN in a few months, I will be in Danang, Hoi An day trip, Hanoi, Cantho, and Sgn. I'm looking buy a couple of items from VN, but i would prefer not going to the market w/aggressivve vendors and negotiation hazzels.
 Here are items I like to buy: pepper, banh trang, coffee beans, dry bamboo (mang kho), and any squid and dry shrimp, I believe these are acceptable items for US. 
 Do you have a reiablie vendor recommendation? Or if you have any other recommendation to bring back to US, I muchly appreciated.
 Also - is it safe to use CC in Grab? I have friends that pay cash instead of paying cc thru app. I hate carrying cash :)
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I carry this with me for quite a while already: 
 I live in Vietnam, and a friend of mine, around 30, from a European country, told me in 2021 already the he need to get to Saigon to his embassy to get a new passport. Quite difficult during Covid, he also doesn’t have big cash to pay for the trip, so he kept on delaying it, until his passport ran out of validity. 
 In early 2023 he made the trip to Saigon finally by taking the train, told me he can’t fly because no passport, so Train best option. When he came back from that trip a couple days later I asked him about passport and if he got his, he told me not yet, embassy have problems bla bla bla. 
 Since then, he told me like three times on different occasions that he moved into a new place under his girlfriends name and kinda hides from immigration and doesn’t really care. If that’s true, we talking about a looooong overstay. 
 So my question: 
 1.) I feel he‘s telling me BS, but why would make shit like that up. What’s the intention??
 2.) Assume he‘s telling the truth, what „problems“ could his embassy make to not give him a new passport?
 3.) Could he really „hide“ from VN police and just overstay months without them seeking for him / finding him? What’s the play here, they actively looking for him or just waiting and hope they catch him one day? He‘s not really „quiet“ about his situation so I know the circle of people Knowing is not small either and I just can’t imagine they not knowing and not caring and not finding.
 This whole story is so damn stupid and I can’t make sense of it. Really looking to hear some fresh opinions on that.
 Edit: Could be he meant „consulate“ instead, I know a lot of people use the word „embassy“ but actually meaning „consulate“, so that’s not the big issue here. 
 Edit 2: Thanks for the replies guys!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How strict is Vietnam with "putting yourself out there"?
 In Indonesia, you can technically be deported for pretty much anything
  
Looking for a roommate, e. g. making a social media post is illegal
 Being a guest speaker at an event, even if non-paid for a volunteer-based organization
 Performing music, poetry, or doing a comedy skit at some bar/open mic can be considered illegal 
 Even having a YouTube channel that makes no money is theoretically deportable
 Meeting business owners to ask them about business collaborations (just hypothetical ones)
  
So, Indonesia is very strict. Will all of these scenarios always get enforced? No. You probably won't get deported if you perform some music at an open mic. But it's technically possible.
 How is it here in Vietnam?
 I'm in the meeting business owners boat. Ironically, I flew here to Vietnam because it's just very hard to open a business in Indonesia while you're in the country, so I thought I'd do it remotely. But now I end up seriously liking it here. It's more foreigner-friendly here, at least from my first impressions. 
 I'm thinking about talking to some businesses about my business ideas for their feedback/thoughts on the ideas. How strict is Vietnam with "advertising yourself"/"putting yourself out there"? I wouldn't be making any money, this is just to validate if I could try something out, at which point I guess I'd have to open a business, or fly out and do something via a German business.
 Thoughts?

 EDIT: Arrived at the hotel and he was demanding extra money for the ride, lucky the there were lots of hotel staff around as I wouldn't have felt safe otherwise. He even followed us to the lobby trying again and again asking to be added as tip etc. I rated the ride 1 star and write a report to grab about it. thanks for the help if I wouldn't have gotten such great replies he probably would have gotten money from me as I wasn't sure and I would have pitied him.

My travel agent said that bamboo airlines went bankrupt and all flights are cancelled I checked online but my flight is still there. I check the website every thing seems normal. Is this true? Is this something I should be concerned about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t know how common this is, but this happened to me just yesterday after living here for about 7 years.
 So I was at an ATM pulling out cash, when I was done there was a man behind me and asked me to help him get his money out of his card. My first thought was that he’s trying to scam me or some other trick, who the hell asks a random stranger to pull money out of their card for them? I looked at him and he looks a little rough, probably a laborer from his clothes and calloused hands, and maybe an ethnic minority as well. He also looked honest and sincere so I thought fuck it, why not. He gave me his card, so I showed him step by step instructions on how to use an ATM, including the part where I told him to put in his PIN in secret and he blurbed out load to me 666666, I was just like bruh 😳. Anyways, we finished it up and he thanked me profusely, then left. I was just standing there dumbfounded that this dude would put so much trust in me regarding his personal finances, someone could have definitely taken advantage of him.
 Would you say this is a weird incident or is this more common than I thought?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like in English, I always think it’s strange to not have two separate words for “chúng tôi“ and “chúng ta” (“we” can include or exclude the person listening).
 Or in French, the counting system is infamously odd.
 It’s not about right or wrong, or which language is better. It’s about finding interesting things that native speakers might not notice.
 So what are some things you find peculiar, or confusing, or things that don’t make any sense to you in Vietnamese?
 Edit: I find the topic has been shifted to "what do you find difficult in Vietnamese" haha. Can we have more answers about some words or phrases or language features you find odd please? actually both directions are welcome, feel free to share

 However this year my stomach has been giving me a lot of trouble (3 years in Vietnam)

 Light, nutritious, comforting.

 What's the name of this Vietnamese song? - YouTube 
 Another thing I can remember was that this song was sung by a guy, dancing on stage together with a girl and the performance involved dancing in front of a giant projector curtain and sometimes walk behind it, as if they're "entering" the screen world and switching back to the real world basically. Hope that makes sense

 My neighbor across the street runs a restaurant. Usually theyre nice and all, no problem. The problem are the guests and staffs that keeps parking their bike IN FRONT of our gate which prevent our vehicles from moving in or out. This happened on many occasion despite many times we remind them. Is there a way we can resolve this permanently? I thought of calling local police and ask if they want a free bike but i doubt theyd do much. Destroying the bike would definitely get things more complicated.
 What would yall do?

 Thousands of years ago, during the reign of King Kinh Dương Vương, the Xích Quỷ kingdom was an unknown stretch of a vast land on the far East, leaning its back on a range of high mountains while looking out facing the oceans from a long shoreline. He married princess Long Nữ, the daughter of Động Đình Vương - sovereign of the Động Đình Lake. They were then blessed with one child, a boy whom they called Sung Lam, popularly known in the kingdom as Lạc Long Quân, the "Dragon Lord of Lạc”. Because of Long Nữ’s origin, their son was believed to be a descendant from the line of the Dragons. And indeed, Lạc Long Quân had extraordinary strength and supreme intelligence. But his succession from his mother’s underwater world developed in him a strong fascination…]]></summary>

 Perhaps it looks an stupid question, but we are a couple planning to go to VN the second half of Nov, and we are roach-phobic. We've seen many post here and there talking about this thing there: it is a south east Asia country, and face cockroaches is likely inevitable. Would you consider not travelling because of this? 
 We are searching for higher end hotels in Hanoi, Ninh Bihn and Hoi An because of this, but even the best rated ones in Booking (e.g. 9,1 - 1,3k reviews) can have a comment of cockroach found. Again, it might sound stupid, but we found cockroaches in the past and completely ruined our trips. What are your thoughts and experiences? thanks a lot

 Also how does it differ from Valentine's Day & International Women's Day?

 Despite being British, I actually grew up in Vietnam, from when I was 9 to 18. I left in 2012 and haven’t been back since - so I’m extremely excited to come back home! :) I’m sure I’ll be shocked at how much has changed! It’s also my girlfriend’s first time in the country. 
 We’re going to be spending Christmas in HCMC (where I grew up), and before that well be in Hoi An. I’m wondering where we can go after for 1.5 weeks of relax. We want a nice beach destination with some beautiful properties, activities, maybe some historical sites, nice restaurants, and somewhere to celebrate the new year! 
 When I was growing up, my parents and I would take quick weekend trips from HCMC to Mui Ne/Vung Tau for the beach, but I’m not sure these are the best options. 
 We heard mixed reviews about Phu Quoc, but everyone is suggesting Da Nang! What do you all recommend? Keeping in mind it’s end of December/January. 
 Any place in particular? Would appreciate ANY help! :)) 
 Cam on!

 For the Vietnamese section, I want to have a similar format so I’d like to end on some sort of craft or art project that is authentic. Some of my students are Vietnamese so I really want to get this right (I’d want to get it right regardless but I feel a little more pressure lol).
 Any ideas? For reference I’m teaching mostly 7th and 8th graders (12/13 years old). Any ideas or input would be super appreciated!

 So my Vietnamese ex-girlfriend saids that guy should always apologize first regardless if they're right or wrong. Especially in an argument. He would always need to "nhường nhịn" her. I know that my ex was not the only one with this idea, because I saw TikTok have a lot of posts about this. But most Western culture would say that communication is key and both side would need to find a middle ground to talk and apologize to each other
 In a breakup, my ex wants me to "dỗ dành" and "níu kéo" her. But Western culture would say go no contact and severe any contact. 
 I don't think there's a right or wrong, it's just a matter of difference in culture (I guess).

A taxi driver approached us with a pic of us when we were arriving (we were walking into the gate). Our actual driver texted me at that moment, so i assume this was some trick, but it felt kind of eerie. 
 Moral of the story: make sure you know what your driver looks like! We confirmed with our hotel that this was not the guy. Might seem straightforward but we almost fell for it. Maybe someone else will use this as a cautionary tale :)

 So I lived in Vn for a few years and I absolutely love the place. 
 I'm looking at coming back to do business now my country has signed a free trade deal with Vietnam. 
 Some friends and I have been trying to contact various places to establish contact with experts in several fields, and we find more often than not that emails on official websites are either unmonitered or they bounce back as inactive addresses. 
 Now I know that business in Vietnam is very much a face-to-face kind of thing, but we're trying to establish some form of rapport before we come over for a expeditionary visit. 
 How do people on the ground deal with this? 
 Are phone calls and not email the primary means of making initial contact with people?
 I'd appreciate some advice for making contacts in Vietnam before we travel there. 
 Thanks!

 I'm traveling to VN in January and will be there until June or so. I plan to stay in 3-5 cities for about 1-2 months at a time with weekend getaways other times. What do you recommend I travel with? I'm debating between a large rolling suitcase or buying a 30L-ish travel backpack. 
 I intend to use Grab for getting around and maybe splurging to rent a car for traveling longer distance? I'm not sure and could use some guidance. I welcome any clarifying questions. Thank you!

As we are 2 guys travelling around my friend asked her to bring a friend. We went out on a date with them and everything seemed to be fine.

 Having just spent 5 days in Da Nang - largely stuck in my hotel room due to torrential rain - I had the bright idea to travel to my next destination (Hoi An) by walking the entire length of the 25km beach on the Da Nang’s east coast.
 It started out great: the weather was nice enough, there were fishermen and families around, and the scenery was perfect for a long hike. I had 2.5L worth of water and OJ with me too, so I was all set.
 However, at around maybe 2/3rds the way - and I didn’t notice at the time, because the transition was quite subtle - it slowly started to become increasingly more uninhabited and barren.

Then, I'll transfer money to this account and withdraw it as needed on my trip rather than carry a bunch of cash with me.
 I will be staying in Hanoi if that makes a difference. Thank you

Many popular spots, some less popular ones like coffee plantations and some temples. But I am planning to stay in Saigon and Hanoi each for an extended period to immerse myself, meet locals, and learn about the ways lives are lived there. (What other reason is there to travel?) I am wondering if anyone has any useful insights for extended stay in these cities, or even suggestions of other cities or towns which would have much to offer for an immersive stay. For extra context I am a writer, a historian (primarily of race and racism in the United States but with interests far beyond that as well) generally interested in social hierarchies and looking to also learn about the realities of Vietnamese socialism/socialist-oriented capitalism.

 Because that is when this unique board game convention takes place!
 Though board games have been a part of Vietnam's past time for a while, with traditional games like cờ tướng (Chinese chess) or ô ăn quan (Square Capturing), mordern board games are relatively new to the mass audience. As such, there have not been many big events dedicated to this awesome hobby.
 Started out as a local event for tabletop gamers, we are bringing back Board Game Fest for the 3rd time, this time on a scale bigger than ever before. With 150 game tables, hundred of board games and several dozen of Game Master and staff, we hope this will be a welcoming event for everyone, young and old, Vietnamese and foreigners alike. There will be many booths with all the big board game coffees in Hanoi, leading board game publishers from Vietnam where you can experience their games/ services. Whether you are new to board game and want to try out some amazing-looking games; or want to check out some of our never-before-seen self-published titles; or just want to hang out and potentially meet someone who shares your interest, there is something for you at our event.
 The event venue will be at TH School - yes that's the beautiful pink building right on Chua Boc street. Book your tickets now to enjoy the best deal (we are only selling tickets to provide a big nice venue for the event). Details in the poster below!
 If you're anyway interested and have further question, feel free to reach me via PM or via our FB page. Our team want make this a meaningful annual event and help grow the tabletop community, so I really hope you will consider joining our tables, and hope we will have a great time together!!

Đôi khi tôi còn thấy chính những nhân viên bán xăng ra ngồi quầy. Có thể thấy rằng hành vi này thực sự xấu, nó nguy hiểm khi người dân thi nhau tàng trữ chất gây cháy nổ và không hề có biện pháp phòng ngừa, nó thực sự gây hoang mang cho tôi, cảm tưởng như rằng chúng ta sắp hết sạch xăng và không có gì để dùng khi đó việc kinh doanh như vậy sẽ đem lại nhiều lợi nhuận. Mong tình trạng này sớm được giải quyết và thu nhỏ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My landlord has various altars around the house. They all have an array of flashing multicolour lights that are on 24/7. 
 The small altar downstairs at the entrance of the house is particularly annoying, because it's always in the corner of my eye. My bedroom door is glass so I can see the lights flashing all the time when I go to bed at night. 
 What is the purpose of the lights? Is it really important they always be on? I'm wondering if it would be a big deal if I turned off the lights at night, and just made sure to turn them on again when my landlord comes to pray. As far as I know it's the money altar, it's not the main ancestral altar, that one is upstairs.
 Edit: thanks for the feedback, I won't interfere with the altar

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't be the only one thinking about this, Vietnam has a 40% market share for iPhones, but this doesn't make sense with the current wages in Vietnam. Some quick numbers here for discussion:
 Cheapest iPhone 15 listed: $799
 Average monthly salary in VN: $733
 iOS Market Share in VN: 40%
 Average monthly salary in Singapore: $6,324
 iOS Market Share in Singapore: 34%
 Average monthly salary in Malaysia: $1,485
 iOS Market Share in Malaysia: 33%
 An intern of mine bought an iPhone 15 for 4x her monthly salary, and is willing to finance it through a 12 months installment. This obsession is pretty fascinating to me, so local peeps please weigh in. But here's my 2 cent: if you need to finance a mobile phone, then you're not financially capable of owning it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you love zombie movies you have given some thoughts on what happens if something like a zombie apocalypse happens in Vietnam.
 My thoughts are Mekong Delta region would be swarmed with hordes of zombies and would be really dangerous to live. Crowed Cities like HCMC or Hanoi would be totally infected in just a couple of days considering the population density.
 Vietnamese dont have guns. So people would be defenseless. Its dangerous to engage zombies in a melee combat. Except groups of ex militants. But zombies are not good as traversing hard terrain. And Vietnam is full of such terrain,85% of territory is mountain so if you just go and make a settlement in a sloppy area. You should be safe. Except for anomalies.
 Best thing i can think of to do is go to high altitude area. A really high place.I would like move to North West or Tay Nguyen regions. Fansipan is a good choice.The Mainly hunting or can even cultivate if you have some offensive weapons to take dons a couple of zombies that might appear. My choice is live on the top of terraced fields so you never worry about food.Vietnam would be among the safest places against zombie. If you have some resources to sustain your self in remote hard terrain.

The embassy in London says they have nothing to do with the process apart from witnessing me sign the documents and stamping them. Has anyone else had this experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From my perspective as a 23 year old, I support innovation in education. Professor Ho Ngoc Dai, as a prominent figure in education reforming who had gone through the hard times in Vietnam, even consider children like a friend, once said "if you consider them like a friend, then you can't scold them". Unfortunately, majority of people in Vietnam and even ppl of my age still support this way of "education", like wtf how can you say you beat them because you "care" about them, which is total hypocrisy. And then the "backthen we got beaten and that gave us success" mentality, which is totally survivorship bias because those people only got like good job with average income, maybe higher because backthen there were more opportunities due to booming economy in early 90s and 2000s. And if the method works then why is corruption and crime is still rampant in the country? 
 Of course this is a cultural issue, and I'm sure that many people may be triggered and even compare to the US or something. And yes, Vietnam is no doubt a part of sinosphere where collectivism and conservatism is widespread, people don't change much and clings to Confucian values much like the way Islamists clings to orthodox view. So what is your thoughts ? Do you support change ?

 The name is different enough that it doesn't violate any copyrights/trademarks, while the recipes are recipes I created myself, apparently there is no copyright on recipes? I'm told that there is nothing that can legally be done about it.
 So, is there anything legal that can be done about it?

 According to my guide book (Le Routard), plenty of excursions should be on offer in all the travel agencies to the several traditional hand craft villages around Hanoi. However, speaking to multiple of these agencies today, it appears most of them don't even know what I'm talking about... Closest I got was a half day scooter tour to Bat Trang. I can find some info online, but also on here it's rarely mentioned. 
 What I was looking/hoping for was a day-tour where you get to visit 3to4 of these villages and can experience/whitness the different craftsman in action.
 Is this maybe not a thing anymore? Is the info in my guide outdated? Has anyone on here ever visited (some of) these villages and was it worth it? Which ones would you recommend?
 Thanks! Grts from Hanoi 👋

Which are the villages which i should visit? And how will the weather be?

 I haven’t had a sip of tap water at all in SEA but have heard other people say they have without any consequences. 
 I’d like to know from you! 
 Do you drink tap water in Vietnam? If so, where do you get it from? Do you advise travelers to drink tap water in remote regions of Vietnam? 
 (For clarity, I have no problem buying water but I like to get honest opinions from locals and other seasoned travelers, and not the copy and paste blog posts of todays computer travelers). Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in Saigon just a couple of weeks and my lungs feel like they're on fire. 
 Walking down the street, the fumes from the thousands of motorbikes zooming by actually make me nauseous and I have to hold my breath while walking. I can even smell them from inside my apartment. I was planning to take a job here, but don't think I can since this is such a big deal for me and affects my physical and mental health. (I also love walking, and this city is probably level 99 difficulty for pedestrians) 
 The noise pollution is pretty bad and I can't sleep. There are bikes outside with loudspeakers blaring the same line over and over. I've stayed in four different apartments and every single one has had loud construction noise from 6am-10pm, every day. Even on Sunday. I was once woke up by hammering noise from inside another apartment at 2am! It seems inescapable. I noticed my ears are ringing when inside when it's silent. Everything is so loud here. 
 That's manageabke though. The worst for me is the air. Although it's pretty good in general compared to hanoi, the traffic just overrides that. 
 When is the metro expected to be built? My daily transportation spending was lower in Singapore than in Saigon 🙁
 Is there any area with low traffic and good air quality? Has anyone else felt the bad effects of pollution since moving here?

Mà bà hoạ sĩ lần này mời về thì cũng nổi tiếng cái trào lưu “artist vs art”, trên page thì cũng nhấn mạnh cái này vài lần nên là e sợ lần này cũng chỉ cosplay thôi.

 My wife’s never rode a bike before and is a little bit sceptical about doing the loop however advised she’d do it if it was on a quad.
 She doesn’t want to do it with another rider and I don’t want to do it on a bike with her on the back of me as i think I’d enjoy it more myself on a bike.
 And we would prefer a group rather than self hiring.

 Obviously asking people in the r/Vietnam subreddit won't get nearly correct answers as people here tend to be more influenced by Western English media but despite that I'm curious at least what the userbase here think/what they see in the country.
 Mainly I want to know it is because I am a Marxist and uphold countries like Vietnam because of how well they progressed and despite Doi Moi I see it as an effect of proletarian power. My country itself was heavily progressing from awful living conditions during socialism but unfortunately we had system change.
 TL;DR: How do you/the average Vietnamese feel about socialism (if there even is in Vietnam after Doi Moi) and Marxist theory?

If anyone has any questions, please give me a shout-out.
 Here are some notes:
  
Vietnamese open mics are often quite restraint and polite, there are a lot of shy wanna be singers, but it’s just a glorified stripped down acoustic karaoke session with pianos and acoustic guitars, so unless you bring your own stuff, it’s mostly just that to show your singing and instrumentalist skills
 Western open mics are quite fun, exuberant and chaotic due to the presence of a stage for electric instrum…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a rather confusing encounter in Ho Chi Minh awhile back. I was walking around Ben Thanh market at around 0900hrs and went to stop at a store, I normally would say Hi or Xin Chao and proceed to ask the price of the item. 
 I noticed the sellers will ask how many item do you want to buy first instead of the price tag. I then ask again how much is it, she said something along the line “Morning price, first customer you don’t say that to me, I sell to you, how many do you want to buy?” 
 Since she didn’t answer my question, I told her I will come back and walk off. 
 Was I rude? Is there a cultural thing or is it rude to ask how much are the price of items here? 😅

 do you have any tips for differentiating what to call people as to not seem rude or offend them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 New account due to privacy reasons.
 I cannot wrap my head around VNese housing market. Used to live in Hanoi, HCM and Danang. Currently scouting Danang properties. Seen maybe over 100 various land/houses options within 5-20B range. And it just throws me away, as I cannot see any logic, behind pricing strategy.
 For example, I've came across several options such as 180sqm land cost 7B, and then 2 parallel streets further - 12B or so. In comparison, neighbourhood is the same, surrounding space/layout was similar too.
 The market seems very saturated. Tons of listings for bigger land (150sqm+). With huge price fluctuation (35M/sqm - 70M/sqm).
 My question is, how does one can buy any of this? With current mortgage rates (12-15% after excluding first few years) it's a money burn going that route. Further, if I understand correctly, VNmese are not very encouraged to take this route, since rates most of the time we're high (~6%), compared with West (1-2%).
 I can only see smaller properties to be in a hot market (3-5B), as it's easier to deal via loans/mortgages, but going further, especially 8B+ route - it becomes a madness.
 Given the market in HCM, I'd see that there is no stop in price increase. I can feel now that it's more of a stagnation period. I'd like to believe, that prices would come down, but at the same time - I feel that greed will be the driver for prices fueling up. However, question appears - how long can this last?
 What I guess, VNese take 7-9% fixed mortgage for 2 years, buy something and try to flip it. Is there any other way, they are able to afford and buy lands/houses for that much?
 What keeps me up at night is that there is just so many listings in Danang, prices seems to be inflated and yet, sellers aren't willing to go much lower. However buyers market is definitely not here as well (for at least 8B+ listings).
 Would love to hear your experience and thoughts while navigating this market!

 To me, there’s just no place like it. The Viet Bac, the Tay Bac, these places are so alive with culture and the scenery is stunning. 
 There isn’t always as much tourist infrastructure, but if you can ride a motorbike then get on it and go.
 October/November is a wonderful time to travel here. Avoid the rainy seasons due to very real risks of landslides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are due to fly into Da Nang on Wed night and fly out internationally on Fri night. I have just read about the current flooding. I know every flood is different, but from your experience with these floods, are my travel plans likely to be ok, ie are the roads, airports etc likely to clear by then?

I was wondering if vegetarian means something extra because isn't bread typically vegetarian? is it more similar to vegan, like no milk or egg? (would be helpful for me if so as i am allergic to milk & egg!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🇬🇧 EN Hi all, 
 As the title says, can I have some travel advice by someone in Da Nang or who has travelled in Da Nang today (since the Level 4 Disaster flood warning was issued today [for the first time in history apparently.]).
 We have a train into Da Nang tomorrow and a flight out of Da Nang two days after.
 We are wondering whether we need to make changes to our plans, or whether taking the risk to go is an okay decision.
 🇻🇳 VN Chào mọi người 
 Như tiêu đề đã nói, tôi có thể có một số lời khuyên du lịch của một người nào đó ở Đà Nẵng hoặc người đã đi du lịch ở Đà Nẵng ngày hôm nay (kể từ khi cảnh báo lũ lụt thiên tai cấp 4 được ban hành hôm nay [rõ ràng là lần đầu tiên trong lịch sử.]). 
 Chúng tôi có một chuyến tàu đến Đà Nẵng vào ngày mai và một chuyến bay ra khỏi Đà Nẵng hai ngày sau đó. 
 Chúng tôi đang tự hỏi liệu chúng tôi có cần thay đổi kế hoạch của mình hay không, hoặc liệu chấp nhận rủi ro để đi là một quyết định ổn. 
 ———
 EDIT: We’ve called some sources who state that the train station is less affected than the airport. Would anyone be able to validate this?
 EDIT: Chúng tôi đã gọi cho một số nguồn nói rằng nhà ga xe lửa ít bị ảnh hưởng hơn sân bay. Có ai có thể xác nhận điều này không?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 My partner, toddler and I have so far spent time in Hanoi, Ninh Binh and Ha Long Bay. What an incredible country, we are having such a great time. We came knowing that it was the wet season but the day we got to Hue my partner came down with some sort of tummy bug... 
 We're taking it easy for a couple of days and keeping the kiddo as entertained as possible but I'm now feeling a little concerned regarding our plans to travel to Da Nang on the 15th. 
 We are getting the train in and our hotel is very close to the beach in the center most part. 
 Judging from the news stories of flooding I can't see how us turning up will be a good thing for ourselves, and the already struggling local services. 
 From a travel weary father of a toddler and partner of a sick girlfriend, please may I have some advice on how to proceed? 
 Our flight leaves from Ho Chi Minh on the evening of the 19th and we have a connecting flight from Da Nang that morning. 
 Many thanks

 Before I came to Vietnam I heard a lot of people saying that people from Hanoi are unfriendly especially compared to the south.
 Now I’ve been in Vietnam for 2 years I’m living in Saigon but frequently go to Hanoi.
 Before I went to Hanoi the first time I was kinda worried that people are not as nice. But quite the contrary was the case.
 I had lots of great experiences in Hanoi and people were generally friendly.
 I often heard that people there are not smiling but I didn’t see that at all. When people see me they show me a peace sign ✌️ or wave and invite me for a cigarette or the tobacco bong or this self made alcohol ( I think it’s ginseng but idk for sure ) 
 Generally I found people very open towards me,maybe those bad experiences people talk about only happen in the city center?
 What I also find interesting is that people talk to me in full blown Vietnamese which I find refreshing. They don’t dumb down or change to English, they just talk and try to make me understand with sign language lol 😂.
 Everytime I’m in Hanoi I feel like my Vietnamese improves a lot.
 Anyways just wanted to share my experience in Hanoi.

 I'm planning to do major cities, Hanoi, Halong bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An, Dalat, HCMC. Originally I was planning to start north and go all the way down to the south and fly out of HCMC. 
 But now I'm having doubts that this is the best route, weather wise and public transportation wise is it better to start south and make my way to the north or vice versa? 
 Any other tips welcomed :)

 Somebody fill me in…
 Is it because so many locals keep them in tiny cages and they just want to roam with the ladies? 
 I’m used to Roosters btw but some of these ones can be a total annoyance sometimes…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't ask this question on r/HistoryWhatIf or any alternate history channel because most of them have no idea of European history. 
 Vietnam is a nation that is well-known for being extremely good at fighting wars, managing to gain independence from a strong nation like China, defeating the Mongols, and expanding down from the Red River Delta to the Mekong Delta, destroying Champa and Cambodia in the process. They also defeated the French, Americans, and Chinese forces which threatened their independence in the 20th century and managed to overthrow the Khmer Rouge which were battle-hardened troops, or so many internet historians say. 
 However, during the 18th-19th centuries, there were many wars the Vietnamese had against the Siamese over the control of Laos and Cambodia. While both sides had their victories and losses, the Vietnamese won more conflicts than the Siamese, which is weird since Laos was controlled by the Siamese while Cambodia was jointly-controlled, meaning that the Siamese gained more land in the war. 
 In 1800, Siam had a population of 4 million while Vietnam had a population of 7 million, almost 2 times more. 
 Without European colonialism, would Vietnam had conquered Siam like how they conquered Champa and the Mekong Delta? Or was Siam too strong of a kingdom to conquer? 
 Many Thais don't know much about the Siamese-Vietnamese wars since it is skipped over in history classes. As I'm not a Vietnamese, I don't know whether these wars are taught much in Vietnamese schools but I'm sure Vietnamese people are more knowledgable in their histories than Thais are in theirs. So I decided to ask the question here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that most of the tourists coming to Vietnam, or SE Asia in general, just hop on a moped with little to no experience. Everyone tells me the same thing to just "find a quiet road, fuck around for 30 minutes and you'll be fine", but also these are the same people that end up hurting themselves or worse - someone else. 
 I don't want a lecture on being a dumb foreigner causing accidents on mopeds because we don't know how to ride them properly, I'm genuinely trying to ask what is a relatively ethical and normal way to learn to ride a moped here? How do you go from no prior experience to taking on the sea of bikes in the big city?
 Currently staying in Hanoi and feel a bit limited to using Grab to get everywhere, especially for the future when I would like to travel to more rural regions that don't have the same accessibility without a bike. I obviously don't want to learn in the traffic here but what would be a good place to go and "fuck around" without anyone going about? 
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I had a conversation with a Russian-Vietnamese (who was born in Russia). She was not okay with Vietnam staying neutral in the Ukraine - Russia war. While I really don't appreciate her point of view, I can see why. After all, she is Russian and she wants people to support Russia. I also have seen the opposite story, where pro-West Vietnamese condemn Vietnam for staying neutral.
 The conversation, unpleasant as it was, was quite interesting. Which do diaspora Vietnamese community care more about, the interests of their native country or the interests of Vietnam ?
 For example, let's say if Taiwan and China went to war, would you expect Vietnam to do something about it for the interest of Taiwan / China because you live in Taiwan / China ? Cause I really don't see the point of Vietnam picking a side.
 Whenever you vote for your leader in your country, do you pick them for the interests of Vietnam ? When Trump got elected, my friends studying in US were absolutely terrified, because they were afraid of him imposing strict laws on immigrants, and that was not a good thing for Vietnamese who tried to work and study over there.

 Can anyone find the Vietnamese version of this song? It must be really old and I don't speak enough Vietnamese to know the lyrics. If this helps, I'm 100% sure they say heart "trái tim" in the Viet version. Probably made around 2010.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If so, why?
 There is too many upsides to getting a Vietnamese passport, and NOT enough downsides.
 - The visa situation will get more stringent over time. Look at what happened post-COVID. One day, you will NOT be allowed to do infinite border runs, even on your 5-year visa exemption. Pre-COVID, it was VERY easy to renew your tourist visa inside the country. Post-COVID, much harder. Look at Thailand ... they charge $24K USD for their 5-year tourist visa ("Thai elite visa")
 - Vietnam's GDP rising.
 - Opening a business is easier. You don't need a Vietnamese partner who owns 51% share of the company
 My prediction is, it will only get HARDER & harder to get a Vietnamese passport as Vietnam's GDP rises ... just look at Vietnam's visa policy -- it's already hard for non-ASEAN tourists to get a visa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apparently, Vietnamese pronouns are really hard for many learners, so I decided to make that one of the first things I'd tackle in the language. Correct me if my explanation is wrong.
 Vietnamese has a few pronouns, of course. The pronoun for I is fairly common, for instance. However, it seems like Vietnamese likes to avoid using true first and second person pronouns, like other Asian languages. However, that means you need some other way to distinguish yourself and different people in conversations.
 Vietnamese chooses age and gender. You imagine that this person is a part of your family and choose a pronoun for you and a pronoun for them that agrees. For example, I would call myself big brother if I'm talking to a little girl and call her little sibling, and she would do that in reverse.
 Here's a chart I made with all the different pronouns: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1WGMQL-_9XU14HV8i4OgvW0fiPY50n4OUcoNOS0q8U/edit?usp=sharing
 I honestly think it's a fascinating system. You get to show respect for the listener in more ways than tu/vous in French, but you also don't have to change the entire sentence, like you would in Korean.

I went check out this house this week and was shown around by this friendly vietnamese woman around my age in her 30s. There was a guy renovating the house who was also super friendly and chatty. I soon realized they were probably together despite the fact it was odd as he could pass as her dad. He's a local, not an immigrant. She has a kid too.
 So days go by when I haven't made up my mind so I send her a message asking if said room is still up for grabs. She says it's been taken. But then proceeds to send me a message saying One thing I want to say to you is you are really handsome and have such a beautiful smile. This followed by a cheerful/smiley emoji.
 Well, what the heck?
 Isn't this at best inappropriate considering she's likely with this other guy? Am I missing a cultural difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have a friend who is a foreigner and has lived in Vietnam for 4 years.
 He had a business visa before for teaching English in Vietnam for 1 year but quit the job and now working remotely for a foreign company. So he is living on an investor TRC & visa. 4 years ago, he had to renew his tourist visa once or twice by leaving Vietnam to Cambodia then entering Vietnam again.
 He now has trouble entering Vietnam as his entry date was on the old expired passport and he is holding his new passport. So at the Cambodia - Vietnam border, they didn't issue him the new visa for Vietnam. He went home, brought his old passport over and still they didn't issue him the visa because they couldn't find the stamp for his TRC on his passport. (what does this mean please help me explain this)
 He has to go to the HCM Immigration office for help. Now I have some questions:
 - Can a foreigner live in VN forever with just tourist visa? How many time can one leave and enter Vietnam on tourist visa? Can he do this for the rest of his life?
 - Can someone work remotely for a foreign country but want to live in Vietnam? What kind of paperwork he needs to be able to get a residence permit here?
 - How long an investor TRC last? Can one keep using his investor visa/TRC for multiple entries in Vietnam?
 - Can someone be a criminal (maybe not wanted) in their country or other country and can enter Vietnam without being recognized?
 - Can one commit a crime in the past and be able to apply for a job in Vietnam?
 - What kind of job can grant one a work permit? Does it have to be a full-time job?
 Is there any other possibility around this case where one won't be able to find a job in Vietnam, or not plan to but want to live in Vietnam? Is there any issue could hold one back from getting a job in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My business is doing really well and I am expected to come into a significant payout. I am a Vietnamese-Aussie who doesn't have a family. 
 My question is what business would you start if you have enough funds and your in-depth knowledge of the Vietnamese market. 
 I'm not fishing for answers only, I want to start a discussion on Vietnam's economy and her next stages and how Viet Kieu or even just general foreign investment can help accelerate that process. 
 Examining the market it's saturated with restaurants and cafes at all levels. I was initially looking into starting a steak restaurant at the 3-4 star range because of my contacts in my home country. But it seems so risky to try and capture that market. A lot of cost into renovations etc. 
 I really want to bring money back into the country in an beneficial way for myself too don't get me wrong. I guess maybe people more knowledgeable than I can answer, thanks.

I can probably guess that computer science education is not as advanced or well funded in other countries, so that is maybe the reason for using an older language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’m traveling to Vietnam for 5 weeks at the beginning of November. I am unsure of what to do for payment. I have a Wells Fargo Visa debit card and CitiBank MasterCard credit card; I am from the USA. I know most tourists pay in cash in Vietnam, but I am worried that my debit card won’t work at ATMs to withdraw cash. Unfortunately, I probably don’t have time to open a new debit card. 
 In addition, I am not sure of how to book through apps like Booking.com, Hostelworld, Grab, 12go, etc. Grab doesn’t seem to accept my USA visa debit card. I have been able to book a couple hostels with my US card but unsure if it will work once I land in Vietnam. 
 I predict I will spend $1-1.2k USD, but obviously don’t want to just carry that much cash to be converted to VND all at once. Maybe I will take $200 cash.
 Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My partner and I will be traveling Vietnam next month (November 12th to 26th) for 15 days. I am thinking of exploring Hanoi, areas in the North, and not going any further south than perhaps Hoi An. We don’t want to rush too much so would prefer to stick to 3 to 4 places. I have some questions that I would appreciate some help with:
  
Ha Giang: We would really love to do the loop on our own but are not experienced on motorbikes so can’t really make that happen. We aren’t into guided tours so wondering if there is an alternative way to enjoy Ha Giang without doing the loop. Trekking perhaps? We are experienced overnight trekkers and like big days such as 10-15 miles per day hiking. Is trekking a good alternative to motorbiking the loop in Ha Giang? If so, can we do this on our own or would we need a trekking guide? To add, we aren’t against hiring a private guide for certain things, especially if it allows us to learn more about the area, just aren’t into big group tours.
 Ninh Binh or Mai Chau: My partner gets sick on boats and we also don’t really like overrun places so considering skipping Ha Long Bay. Would you perhaps recommend Ninh Binh or Mai Chau as an alternative for a few days? If you could only go to one, which would it be?
 Phong Nha Ke Bang: I would really like to go here but I know November is the rainy season there. Is it still worth trying to go? Can you do trekking or some of the caves without a guide or are guides required? I was planning on not going further south than Hoi An but should we perhaps try to skip some of central Vietnam and try to see somewhere drier such as Dalat?
 These are the places I would like to see but won’t have time for everything. What would you recommend removing/adding? We enjoy physical activities such as trekking, cycling, nature, sleepy towns, good food, the ability to explore by bike.
 
  
Hanoi
 Ha Giang
 Mai Chau
 Ninh Binh
 Phong Nha Ke Bang
 Hoi An
 Dalat
 
 Thanks so much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anglish is a thought experiment about what English would sound like if it had no loanwords from Latin, Greek, French, etc. Some examples are Uncleftish Beholding ("Atomic Theory" - all the scientific words which are borrowings from Latin/Greek are directly translated into English), and the Anglish Moot (an Anglish Wikipedia, basically).
 I'm intrigued (as a Vietnamese person) what Vietnamese would look like if we were to do something similar - no Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary, no French and English loanwords. Expressing scientific/modern concepts (and many everyday concepts as well - such as time; "thời gian/时间") without Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary would be very challenging, IMO - probably because Chinese has been influencing Vietnamese longer ago, and for a longer time, than Latin/Greek/French/Old Norse have been influencing English.
 From "Uncleftish Beholding", which calls an electron a "bernstonebit" (a calque of "electron", which comes from the Greek for "amber", "amber" being a loanword from Arabic by way of Old French), perhaps an electron could be "chớp con" (a calque of Chinese 电子; Sino-Vietnamese reading điện tử). Maybe a computer could be "óc chớp" (calque of Chinese 电脑). (Tính - all senses - is a Sino-Vietnamese word)
 Just to clarify: this is only a thought experiment by someone interested in languages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tôi là nam.Năm nay 16 tuổi đang học trong 1 trường công. Gia đình tôi cũng không thuộc khá giả lắm, cũng coi là có của ăn của để. Nma hiện giờ gia đình tôi không ổn lắm, đang trên bờ vực li dị. Vì bố tôi hay đi uống, nhậu nhẹt về có lời lẽ quá đáng và xô xát với mẹ tôi.mẹ tôi không thích điều này nên hay cãi và lớn tiếng mỉa mai. Tất cả nguyên nhân của cuộc cãi vã là mẹ tôi cho "bạn " mượn 70 triệu không qua giấy tờ từ 8 năm trước đến bây giờ vẫn không trả đồng nào trong khi gia đình tôi hiện đang khó khăn vì chị tôi vừa lên đại học và cần nhiều thứ để chi. Và mẹ tôi còn mượn họ hàng tiền có kèm lãi, vòng tròn thiếu tiền =>mượn nợ=>trã tiền+lãi=> thiếu tiền xoay vòng liên tục khiến nhà tôi khó khăn hơn. Bố tôi cực kì bất mãn về việc này nên khi say hay dùng việc này để sỉ vã mẹ tôi. Khiến mẹ tôi không chịu nổi và muốn li dị, hiện tại đã viết giấy và chỉ cần ký và nộp toà là gia đình tôi đổ bể. Tôi đang đứng trước vấn đề muôn thuở của đề tài này " con chọn theo ai?" Thật sự thì tôi chả muốn họ li dị hay chọn theo ai cả, giờ tôi chả biết làm thế nào. Xin mọi người cho tôi một lời khuyên

 Been to various locations around Vietnam and the world, but I have never experienced such a high concentration of rudeness, in-politeness and general unprofessional behaviour than I have in Da Lat, second to Paris, of course.
 I've read many people here complain about the behaviour of locals (yet choose to stay), in my experience barely 1 in 50 interactions have been negative. Yet, in Da Lat, this was flipped where barely 1 in 5 interactions were pleasant. This included drivers at Langbiang (a massive tourist trap, but anyway) literally running to their Jeeps and quickly driving away when asked for assistance, attendants being more pushy to payment than I've experienced elsewhere, rude staff, attendants etc., incredibly dangerous and aggressive motorcycle drivers, and shop attendants promising to help with postal/online orders than ignoring messages or giving one word replies to detailed questions (messaged in vietnamese) when followed up with. Along with your usual long stares from locals, attempted rots at tourist traps etc.
 Before people jump the gun with "what do you expect in Vietnam/tourist place/being a forigner etc." I'm used to people in cities with lots of tourism being rude or just tired of the people who's income they rely on (Paris and Kyoto are notable examples), but what I experienced here was far beyond anything I have in other parts of Vietnam such as Da Nang, Hanoi or even HCMC.
 Is this something locals and other travellers have found? Do Da Lat people have a reputation for their attitude in Vietnam or did I just have several one-off experiences?
 Oh, sorry I forgot to start the post with "I love Vietnam, its people, its culture etc. but....", its implied

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnamese source here, and you can pretty much find the latest info about this greedy coach everywhere recently.
 A quick brief for those who don't know Vietnamese:
  
Vietnamese young athletes of the national table tennis team informed the public about how bad their daily meals were, and a big investigation was carried out 
 apparently they were supposed to have a 8-person dinner which cost was around 800,000vnđ (~32 US dollar), but none of the provided images about the meal proved such thing (fried tofus, boiled veggies, etc), and apparently all of them was being heavily under-fed 
 things turned out that a huge part of their provided money from the sport department was kept by the coaches
  
Latest news shows that the head coach explains that he's just keeping the money because some athletes have been scammed before by online deals, therefore he would be keeping all the money and return it to them at the end of the year.
 These greedy men are now fired.

 “I tell them,” Giap replied, “that the French went back to France and the Americans to America. But the Jews have nowhere to go. You will not expel them.”

Constantly pushing in lines, being rude to tour guides, at one point I saw a Chinese man tap snatch a pair of tongs a girls was using to pour food, poured for himself, and then gave them back. Definitely don’t think all of them are, just seen it happen so much in the 8 days i’ve been here. It’s almost as if the they believe that everyone is here to serve them. Chinese people I’ve met in Australia are generally well mannered, so completely baffled to why they are like this here.

I don’t see the point of keeping pets just to keep them as prisoners.
 Never had a walk, they bark constantly, more if you go anywhere near them. They must be suffering constantly. In developed countries there’s agencies that stop this disgusting behaviour..
 Do you think people in Vietnam will ever change their attitude to the treatment of animals?

Is it easy to book a transfer through the hotel? We would need a transfer from Hanoi to Halong Bay and then from there to Ninh Binh.
 What area should I stay in Ninh Binh?
 For tours do all hotels in Ninh Binh offer tours that you can book day of?
  
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just got into Ha Long (Bai Chay beach) last night. We are staying at a fairly nice hotel right off the beach in an area that is roughly six blocks squared. The area consists of only hotels, probably 60-80 establishments, of which only about 12 are open and active. Almost every other building, which is multi-stories and beautifully modern, is empty and dark with nothing inside the lobbies. There are maybe 3 cafes that might be open, and maybe 3 restaurants that offer 2-3 dishes each. 
 There is literally NOBODY here. In the 48 hours we have been here, we have counted about 15 other tourists on both the beach and the hotel area. Aside from that, it is completely deserted. The wide streets have almost no traffic, with a car or two (mostly taxis) going past every 15 minutes or so. 
 The closest place to buy beer/snacks/smokes is over a mile away. The beach itself had 2 other people on it until about 3 pm this afternoon. Everything is closed until about 4 when 1 place on the beach opened to sell beer and snacks. 
 So what gives? We understand that it is off season right now and most tourists come November- March. But this place is completely deserted. It’s almost dystopian. We have been to other places throughout south east Asia during off season and nothing compares to how completely deserted this place is. Does anyone know what is going on?

 The fight will be advertised and broadcasted around the world which makes great profit and can help boost the economy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this question offended anyone, but I'm just genuinely curious. I can't understand why so many Vietnamese want to move to the US.
 I used to live in district 1, HCMC and there's insanely long line of people waiting at the US embassy basically everyday
 Basically all of the older people I know, and quite a few young people really like the US and want to move there.
 It's really far away, which makes flying back to visit family a huge pain. Things are also really expensive and it's getting rapidly worse. Immigration policy is strict, and it's even harder to get the green card to stay there.
 Not to mention the US has a lot of problems too. Just gonna mention 1: racism. I have heard a lot of stories about racism against Asian people in the US.
 I do think the US has quite a few things better than Vietnam, but if you can afford moving to the US then you can definitely afford moving to countless of other, much better countries. Even if just the English speaking ones, there are a few.
 My brother was obsessed with the US, moved there 8 years ago, worked really hard but still don't have green card. He is now starting to hate it and want to move to another country instead.
 My personal experience. I moved to the US and lived there for 1 year. I hated every second of it, my time there was horrible, and I was really depressed, even contemplated suicide a few times during my time there. Then I went back to Vietnam and my mood improved dramatically. After staying at home for a while I moved to Japan. Still living in Japan right now, and much happier than I ever was in the US.
 So what do you think? Please share your thoughts.
 Edit: The point of this post is not saying that Vietnam is better than living in the US. The point is why do Vietnamese people only care about and want to move to the US, while ignoring pretty much all other countries. Because if they can afford moving to the US, they can afford moving to those other countries

 Curious if any NBA fan out there knows a good spot/sports bar to catch some games? I'll be in Saigon for a few weeks in Feb/Mar next year. Most games should be around 7/8am in Vietnam so I'm afraid that's too early for a lot of these places. TYIA

 I will be going on the Ha Giang Loop in December! Although I have not planned which agency or hostel I will be doing it with, I will definitely do it when I visit Vietnam in December!
 My question is, as amazing as it looks. There is one death road which does get me quite nervous. Its usually on day 2/3 which is just a narrow road with no gate and your basically at a cliff edge.
 My question is, are there any hostels which allow you to walk up this specific route? It's only a couple hundred meters but instead of being on a easy rider I would rather have much peace of mind walking up the route.
 Please let me know and any recommendations you may have! Thanks!

He has my wife and I over for food and karaoke multiple times a year with his whole family. We want to return the favor and have them over our house for dinner. I’m looking for suggestions on what American dishes I should make and which dishes I should stay away from? I’ve thought about trying my hand at some Vietnamese dishes but don’t want to insult them by possibly not making them right or whatever. I was thinking possibly going seafood route? Maybe some kind of seafood boil? Grilled fish? Maybe a pasta with clams? Or possibly smoking some beef ribs? I appreciate any input and suggestions. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is something I’ve wanted to ask for a while. I am from Nepal but grew up in the US. Nepal had a lesser known People’s Revolution in 90s and 2010s. Currently I believe there are 3 major parties; “Maobadi” (far left, militant), Communist Party of Nepal (left), and Congress (center left). However I think a lot of younger Nepali people are starting to lose faith in leftist ideology. I am 24 now, and I feel like more and more I am shifting more towards the left politically, socially, and morally. But since you’ve guys had one of the largest revolutionary movements in history. What do YOU guys feel about it, is what I want to know. To be honest I don’t even know much about the politics of Vietnam and it’s society. So any input is valuable. Hope the mods allow this post.

 I have heard of other Viet Kieus paying agency to get their citizenship (passport, then CMND) ranging from $300 to $3000 USD.
 Edit: Some people are saying it's EASIER to do it while in Canada but why is it? Seems counter-intuitive, wouldn't it take longer because they want to see physical papers and that has to be sent from across the pond or no?

Is it a common ingredient and what kind is it exactly ? i suspect that its not traditional, but it was an option and so gooood!

 First, we plan to spend a few days in Hanoi and then visit HaLong Bay from there. After that, we'll head to SaPa for 1-3 days. Then, we intend to continue our journey to Hoi An and wrap up our trip in Ho-Chi-Minh City. In total, we plan to spend 18 days in Vietnam. Should we change our destinations? Is there anything important we're missing? We appreciate every single response!
 Best regards! 🙋‍♂️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a tropical country with quite a few uses for coconut, the coconut palm/fruit makes surprisingly few appearances in folklore that I am aware of. Sọ Dừa is the only well-known story (to my knowledge) where there is a strongish allusion to coconuts. 
 Are there any origin stories for the coconut in Vietnamese folklore? I know that for example, many Polynesian cultures have stories about a giant eel who is beheaded and the first coconut palm grows from its head, explaining why coconuts look sort of like a face when you dehusk them.
 Or other folktales where coconuts/coconut palms play a significant role.
 Also, I've heard that coconuts with flesh/water that didn't develop properly are said to have been "eaten by the moon "(bị trăng ăn). I can't find any allusions to any other crops being eaten by the moon. Is there any specific mythology about why the moon eats coconuts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not joking. Serious question: do you guys give 70-90% of your income to your wife on monthly basis?
 I lived in Korea and Japan for 6 years and get married with a Korean woman speaking Vietnamese excellently. I often have conversations with Japanese and Korean male co workers and business partners. I swear they rarely do this. 
 Since my wife and I settled down in Hanoi, she has hung out and done yoga with some Vietnamese women in the neighborhood. Then, she went home and dropped hints by telling stories like:
 “Our neighbor A’s husband sends her 90% of his monthly income, so she can manage finance of the family for him, buy what they need and do saving. He only keeps 15 mil for his personal use.”
 I know she will never directly ask me to do that. My wife is typical modern independent Korean woman having good income as professional Vietnamese-Korean translator. I keep my own money and she keeps her own money. We have a common bank account to which both of us send money for family expenses. My annual income = 5x her income, so I contribute much more. She is the person who came up with this idea, I totally agreed. She bought 70% of stuffs in our house.
 Yesterday, I saw a video on TikTok. That guy says his salary is automatically sent to his wife bank account by his company, and his wife would give enough amount of money for his living. I viewed the comments to his video, and it seems many people do this. I guess they were joking (not sure), but his video really raised my curiosity to ask this question. I am asking the same question on a Facebook group. Let’s see how many of us actually do this hehe. 
 We are young family (30 husband and 28 wife). We may have the first kid next year, so a solid financial plan is a must.

 Also please critique my plan for cat ba plan. Open to suggestions
 My current plan is:
 November 5 Leave Hanoi for Cat Ba -Take Bus(cat ba express) to Cat Ba, speed boat included 7:45 to 11:30 $14 USD -Check in Hotel -Trung Trang Caves -Hospital Cave? -Hang out around Cat Ba -Rent bikes, scooters to explore island -This seems to be an activity driven island, biking, climbing, etc.
 November 6 Cat Ba
 Serenity Premium Cruise -It's more of LAN Ha Bay on the East Side of Cat Ba but they say it's more green and less crowded/polluted -This will depart from Cat Ba around 7:30 AM -Ends around 3:15 -$35 USD! -https://halongserenitycruises.com/ details/
 Hang out in Cat Ba for the night
 Latest flight from Haiphong to Da Nang is at 5:55pm. I don't think we can get to Haiphong in time to catch that so we have to stay the night.

 I hear vietjet is stingy with AC and prone to long delays. AirAsia flights times aren’t as desirable and they fly into DMK airport instead of BKK (not sure if that’s good or bad). I hear Vietnam airlines is regarded highly but their flights cost more. 
 I’m happy to pay a bit more for a better experience but the flight duration is 2 hours at max so not sure if it makes much difference? 
 Anyone have any strong opinions to share about any of those three airlines?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who didn't know, it's a mini truck/tractor-like vehicle used for transporting materials for construction. Folks living in modern city areas might have the privilege of not having to witness or experience this atrocity.
 Man, screw this damned of an ancient, older than dino-fossil, out-dated, dirty vehicle that pumps out zillion tons of harmful smokes, from black to blue in color, to the atmosphere for every meter it goes.
 I live in a suburban area where construction of houses is frequent, and this damned vehicle goes rampant on the street, crossing my house once every 3-5 minutes for hours straight, that's how crazy and obnoxious it is. My biggest problem is not its noise, but the amount of godawful enormous smoke emissions it produces.
 Ever travel on a road when you're riding a bicycle BEHIND this monster ? Yeah dude, have fun inhaling ALL that smoke this vehicle constantly pumps out of itself all the way until you reach your destination. This thing should absolutely be banned for harmful effects to environment and people alike.
 That's it. Thanks for coming to my TEDx talk

It seems like this is a scam or a ripoff at best. Does anyone have firsthand experience going to one of these places? If I go what can I expect? A semi-decent time or is it just something I should absolutely avoid like the plague?

When i Booked, The website was set as Vietnam English (Locationa and Language) and I made the transaction in VND through an International Card. But when I'm checking the same flight through Trip.com or Global USD Mode of the Website, The prices are doubled. Did i just got a sweet deal or made a huge mistake? Will it be a problem if a foreigner has a ticket booked from the Website in VND? Please Help if you have some information regarding this. 
 Chào các bạn, tháng 12 mình sẽ về thăm Việt Nam và đặt vé máy bay Bamboo Airways đi Phú Quốc đi Hồ Chí Minh. Khi tôi đặt chỗ, trang web được đặt là tiếng Việt (Vị trí và ngôn ngữ) và tôi đã thực hiện giao dịch bằng VNĐ thông qua Thẻ quốc tế. Nhưng khi tôi kiểm tra cùng một chuyến bay thông qua Trip.com hoặc Chế độ USD toàn cầu của Trang web, Giá sẽ tăng gấp đôi. Tôi vừa có được một thỏa thuận ngọt ngào hay đã phạm một sai lầm lớn? Sẽ có vấn đề gì nếu người nước ngoài đặt vé từ Trang web bằng VNĐ? Xin hãy giúp đỡ nếu bạn có một số thông tin liên quan đến điều này.

Considering their 19 year age gap though, I'm beginning to wonder if the younger sister is her daughter. It's the way she holds her that makes me consider this. 
 I wonder if she disguises her daughter as a younger sister just to avoid potential stigma.

So I called my own bank (Citibank) and they tell me that they can only provide a Reference Letter with my account number (not the Debit Card number) and it will take a week to get that letter or they can expedite a card and send it by Tuesday. The issue is, I leave here Tuesday morning to Hanoi. That card is my only card for cash and what not. What the hell do I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Went to saigon just to watch HTL vietnamese concert. I just want to see her live and check on the concern scene.
 What I observed : 
 The concert venue looks like an old gymnasium with pipes on the way inside the concert grounds which is unsafe since someone can trip over. 
 But the stage and production value of the concert was superb. The stage has mulple large LED display panel, smoke effects and fire effects. There are orchestra situated in the back of large display panel. There is 3 or 4 different drones on the whole duration of the concert. And multiple cameras all over the place. 
 The songs performed was on her album hoang and link and the encore song is an unreleased song together with the artist in Gieo Que. 
 Most of the audience are singing along with the songs and they coordinatedly changing the color of their light sticks in the color of the LED display. 
 I really enjoyed the arrangement of the songs in the last 5 songs since it has a live rock band feel specially with the drummers performance. 
 About HTL performance though was underwhelming. Her voice feels to me is lipsynced (or maybe overprocessed?). There is no interaction with the audience and feels that it is a performance video and not a concert. I dont know if this a vietnamese thing since most of the concert i gone to has a least interaction to the fans / audience. 
 Overall i enjoyed the concert despite some flaws.

Should I take a sleeper train or sleeper bus? Or will that take too much time? Is it better to get Airbnb or a beachside hotel?I initially wanted to go to Sa Pa but I checked the November temperatures in Sa Pa and I don't think I can deal with the cold. I am from a tropical country.

 We gave birth our daughter here. We spent a lot of money on her entertainment, health care, education… I hadn’t noticed much until I realized we spent over 50 million vnd on our daughter last month. I think it is quite much for me (i am bread winner). I ask this question to see how people spend money on raising kids in Vietnam and get some insightful suggestions. I need to reduce expenses (around 30-40mil is perfect) but still give our daughter the best things.
 Kindergarten Tuition: 15 mil
 Babysitter: 8 mil
 Child food and supplements: 12 mil 
 Child care product: 2 mil
 Clothes: 2 mil (she’s growing fast)
 Sport and entertainment: 3 mil
 Language education (English and Belarusian): 10 mil. My wife wants the daughter to speak mom’s language well. I can’t say no. I teach her Vietnamese with 0vnd. 
 Edit: please ignore my username, my wife just joked me :))

 From my understanding and experience, they are eaten in thailand, China, Malaysia etc but seem to be missing in vietnamese cusine. I know they have started to be farmed recently and I assume they must grow as they grow pretty much everywhere. Consequently most places I have had mussels here, even at good places, tend to be overcooked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like the title says, it's a joke. And not even a funny one. And here's my unhinged rant about it.
 Since the implementation of "simulated situations" test, the Vietnamese driving test has stooped to an absolute clusterfuck of bureaucratic mire, created by senile buffoons who I guaran-goddamn-tee you don't have the slightest clue what's it like to be behind the wheel.
 Here's the premise: you're given a medley of 10 clips, ranging from 40-50 seconds in length, showing situations that can happen on the road (the majority of them are half-baked 3D scenarios - how realistic). You have to press spacebar when you see a potentially dangerous action. There's a set time limit in which you have to mash the button, and you'll be graded anywhere from 0-5 depending on when you do it.
 Already this sounds like a horrible idea, knowing that there's heavy implication that your intuition can fuck right off and this is strictly a memorize-and-answer kind of test. You can see the sitch and press spacebar ZERO POINT ONE SECOND EARLY and it will be a wrong answer.
 WHO THE FUCK IN THEIR RIGHT MIND THINKS IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO FORCE FEED THIS SORT OF HORSESHIT INTO PEOPLE'S HEADS AND CALL IT A "TEST"???
 Apparently the Ministry of Traffic and Transports, with their infinite fucking wisdom, alongside whoever ratify the change, do.
 And the tragedy is, it's unlikely that this will be revoked, so anyone (including me) who thinks of getting a driver's license now can either suck it up or go fuck themselves.

 I am originally from Vietnam, have lived in US for years and want to move back to VN. I've been told after 1 year of living in Vietnam I can adopt domestically, but curious to know if anyone has done this?

My grandma ate american food around the same time and got so sick she was hospitalized and now can only eat white rice and meat. Did anyone else or your parents/grandparents experience this? I’m wondering if it’s less common now that american food franchises are popping up in vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have only been here for 2 days. Call me crazy, but I feel like this is one of the nicest beach cities or beach/city that I have ever been to. I've lived in many places
  
Siargao Island, PH
 La Union Beach, PH
 Baler Beach, PH
 Cebu City, PH
 Bali, ID
 Jogja / Jogja Beaches, ID
 Hua Hin, TH (just 2 months)
  
Philippines used to be my home until I lost my job/home/friends during COVID. It was extremely painful for me and I never found a foot in Indonesia after the borders opened up. Being here in Da Nang is the first time since 3 years ago when I lost my home/everything that I get a sense of home and comfort even though I really can't speak the language aside from a few phrases and tones are driving me crazy lol.
 It's really nice here in Da Nang. Vietnamese people are kinder than I expected (people here say a lot of negative things about VN people), the beach is much cleaner than I expected as well. I just came from the beach and feel so refreshed. I love this city after just two days. It's a wonderful setup that allows you to walk so easily north to south and hop into random coffee shops. I wish I could make this place my home. Although probably unlikely unless I move to HCM for a job but yea, this place is so great.
 The only thing that's terrifying AF is how crazy you people drive here LOL!

 I went to the Dan Sihn market today. Great experience and saw a lot of war memorabilia, but I checked online and one article claimed up to 99% of the stuff was fake and most of the authentic things were bought a long time ago. This seems like an absurd number, so perhaps people here know this better than me; how much of the stuff sold there is real? Would you buy anything there?
 Thanks in advance. Having a great time in this wonderful nation!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All my life I was taught to be polite and respectful to older people. But some older people are so rude but then if you say something back you’re hỗn láo bad guy
  
Scenario 1: at Tan Son Nhat, in TSA line, this lady was extremely close to me. Every time I moved up, she inched up directly next to me. So I said “Cô, làm ơn đứng xa xa một chút giùm.” She stopped standing close to me and didn’t say anything but then started whispering about me to her husband saying “Con nhỏ mất dạy.” Like wtf did I do 😭 
 
scenario 2: getting off the plane. I was removing my suitcase from the overhead compartment. You know viet aunties do that nudge thing if they need to get by or they’ll tap you and say move. Well this lady started to shove me aggressively. There was nowhere for me to move since the people in the row above me were in the aisle. The first one, two times I let it go, even the third. Then she kept doing it getting more aggressive each time. This is where I admit I was being really rude back. I turned to her and said “cái gì vậy.” She stopped shoving me and looked at me with full on rage in her eyes like this 😡. Like ma’am, you’re the one shoving me 😭 
 
 I used to always yield to older people but now I’m starting to talk back to them because they can’t demand respect without being polite to others first

 Since I moved to Vietnam with my husband, many family relatives, friends of husband, co workers of parents in law have come to visit me and my unborn baby.
 They gave us many things like baby clothes, toys, nutritional food, baby care products,…. The new thing to me is that there is always an envelop of money attached in these gifts. It is often from 1 million to 5 million vnd. The old uncle of my husband even gifted me and baby 1000usd. It is quite strange to me. I feel shy when receiving easy money from people like this. Then, I behaved unnaturally when receiving the gifts from them.
 My husband family even say they may come back after baby is born.
 Why did they do that if they had already gifted us expensive tangible things?

Now, with my birthday approaching, I'm considering a trip to Vietnam. Initially, I was thinking of Hanoi, but a Vietnamese friend suggested Hoi An in central Vietnam.
 Choosing between the two cities is a bit challenging. I usually start with major cities before exploring smaller ones, which leans towards Hanoi. However, the idea of a more relaxed, less touristy experience in Hoi An is appealing.
 I have six days and five nights, factoring in day trips to nearby places and wanting to immerse myself in local life, so I can't visit both cities at the same time. I'm seeking advice from fellow travelers and locals on which city to begin with. I enjoy sketching buildings and nature, and exploring cafes, so finding the right backdrop for these activities is important.

Nearly every “basic” word i learned that has an everyday usage (nha ga, ca phe, va li, sa bong, pho mai) comes from some french word. Are the loanwords mostly found in simple everyday words or also more complex words/phrases (politics, emotions, technical terms, etc) as well?
 If it was possible to make an estimation, approximately how much of the vietnamese language is derived from french?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I just booked my honeymoon in Vietnam for Nov. 24-December 8th. Would love any suggestions on the itinerary below:
 November 24-26th: Hanoi November 27th: Bai Tu Long Cruise (2 day/ 1 night) November 28th: Hanoi (to rest after the cruise & leave for Sa Pa early the next day) November 29th-December 2nd: Sa Pa December 2nd-6th: Hoi An/ An Bang Beach December 7th: last night in Hanoi before we fly out 
 I just had a few questions: 1. Firstly, I read that it’s the very end of the rainy season in Hoi A during early December. Do you think it’s still worth going and risking the rain, or would it be better to choose somewhere else? We want at least one relaxing beach time and also really wanted to see Hoi An. I also read it can be beautiful around Christmas. Is it worth it? Worried about being rained out the whole time but hoping if it’s at the end it might be okay. 2. Is Bai Tu Long bay as beautiful as Halong Bay? Worth it to book Bai Tu Long instead? 3. We’re planning on booking the EcoSapa limousine buses to/from Sapa and Hanoi. Are these a good choice?
 Any other recs/thoughts would be greatly appreciated (especially for a honeymoon vibe)! Thanks so much in advance ❤️

The album showcases accents from all three regions, and it even includes a song reminiscent of 'nhac do.' I've been listening to it on repeat since YouTube recommended the live showcase to me. What are your thoughts on this?
 I don't often listen to Vpop, and I feel like I've been missing out on a lot by only focusing on K-pop for years. Which other artists and their releases do you recommend? I particularly enjoy Truc Nhan and Trung Quan, especially singers who perform well live.

 The daughter has become tremendously successful by every metric (has her own e-commerce business, active social life, makes 6 figures) but her mom keeps trying to guilt about how she could die any minute (either from poor health or suicide) and that it’s her “duty” to live with her mom.
 This is the same woman that forced her then 18 year old daughter to sleep in the same bed with her every night to prevent her from masturbating. When I ask my other relatives what they think they actually side with the mom and say the most important thing in life is being near family and this idea of “independence” and “adventure” is pointless and irresponsible. Lol

 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m single m (31yo) Vietnamese but grew up in Germany. I’m interested in what fixed costs you have monthly. I have heard that in Vietnam what rent and food is very low. For me, for example, the two items already make up 40-45% of my income. (Berlin - top location / 3 rooms / 81qm)
 What else comes up are: Insurance, communication, mobility, loan repayments, etc. In the end, I'm left with about 10% of my net income per month to save, so not much either. You don't get rich that way. How does it look in Vietnam?

 What would a foreigner expect to be paid in Vietnam working in tech?
 I'm aware there can be a big divide between what companies pay locals vs foreigners (such as pilots). I'm wondering if this is the same in the tech world, I have a Vietnamese partner and would like to move there at some point - but looking at the job adverts on indeed etc. and the salaries are tiny in comparison to where I am now (UK). Obviously the living cost in Vietnam is equally a lot less than UK but even so getting a nice apartment in Hanoi or Saigon could be comparative to some UK house prices.
 I'm a network engineer btw.

 Me and my friends at around the same age have been seriously struggling to find decent jobs since the beginning of 2023. I thought I was lucky to find a job at a tech company with an "ok" salary (1000usd gross). Turned out the company is exploitative and management is extremely toxic and abusive. So back to the grind to find a job for the last couple of months. 
 Why are companies trying to tell us Gen Zs as unstable and indecisive in our careers when in reality, we're (or most friends I know) just trying so hard to find a DECENT job where we can stick around for stability without being exploited to the point of mentally suffering to get by?
 Some recruiters even told me that my salary expectation was too high :) My expectation is 20-25M net/month?? Mind you, I have 4 years of experience, fluent at English and graduated from a top university in Aus. I know it largely depends on the job, industries... but it's affected my self-esteem somewhat. 
 If you're a young native Vnese are you going through the same thing?
 If not, please teach me how to sniff out the bad companies and find ones that pay you you're worth?? Open to discuss further
 Edit: I live in HCM, the most expensive city in this country so my expected salary is just enough for me to pay rent, groceries, have very fundamental household needs fulfilled and left with around 2-3mil extra to save. I dont think its too much to ask..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved to Vietnam this year about six months ago. Almost right on cue, I started to have stomach problems, mainly in the form of diarrhea. Curiously, aside from two particularly awful days, it rarely manifests as outright food poisoning where it affects me the whole day. Rather I'll get "you have 30 seconds to comply" situations. Cafe sua especially has a tendency to cause this roughly 1/4 of the time, so I just avoid it now.
 If I cook at home or eat more expensive foreign cuisine like Korean or Japanese food, the problem alleviates and my bowels actually become normal. However, if I go out to eat Vietnamese food (even at busy restaurants with high turnover) or drink cafe coffee (including even some supposedly safe looking coffee shops like Cafe Amazon), it's only a matter of time before things rear their ugly head again. Most of the time, I'll be fine, but I feel like a bout or two of diarrhea (but not out and out food poisoning, I never throw up or feel nauseous) every two weeks isn't normal. It feels like a shame to not feel comfortable eating the local food due to these issues. 
 I have never had these issues before, and the timing from my arrival here (as well as its alleviation when i switch to home cooking only) is quite conspicuous. From what I hear, travelers diarrhea is supposed to resolve within a few weeks, not six months. Has anyone else experienced these issues? Is my stomach just not built for here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently there was a video of a teacher bullying a student. The reason is because that student didn't buy desserts from the bakery the teacher told her to buy. And then later the headmaster of that school wants to punish the student who upload the video. They are trying to cover their wrong doing and warn others not to publish the evidence to save the school's face. 
 Vụ này ở VN mấy ngày nay nổi rầm rầm chắc ai cũng biết. Vấn đề là mình cảm thấy những vụ liên quan đến bạo lực học đường, dù là do giáo viên hay học sinh bắt nạt lẫn nhau, đều bị nhà trường hoặc cố giấu nhẹm hoặc là lờ đi không hề nhắc đến, có vụ nữ sinh tự tử do bị bắt nạt quá đà mà nhà trường biết nhưng cố tình ép nữ sinh đi học để bị bắt nạt tiếp, trong khi đó không hề đứng ra xử lý gì việc bắt nạt. 
 Cái này rõ ràng ai sống ở VN đều biết là để giữ điểm thành tích, thanh danh cho nhà trường. 
 Nghĩ ai còn đang đi học với ai có con cái còn đi học sẽ thấy thế nào, hoặc là bị bắt nạt rồi đến mức phải chuyển trường, thành vết sẹo tâm lý, trong khi đó không ai bênh vực cả. Nếu ko có những clip bằng chứng như vậy ai sẽ biết đến vụ việc bị bắt nạt? Mà giờ còn phạt cả những ai dám nói, dám đưa clip lên nữa.
 Các bạn nghĩ sao về vụ này?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here I will answer how to get the vat refund. When you buy any item in Vietnam. Costly items like electronics, phone, camera etx. The shop needs to fill up the customs declaration form. It will mention your passport details. Entry exit date, expiry date etc. You can claim the vat refund only if you are on a tourist visa, exiting the country. At the airport, you need to go to the customs office. At Hanoi airportz it's little tricky. The security, police don't understand English. I asked 4 people. They could not answer. Information desk could not explain me even after I showed the translator. Eventually I found out the customs office. 
 I presented the customs declaration form to the officer. He took 2-3 minutes to verify it and forwarded to a clerk of MSB bank who was sitting at the next counter. She asked me to sign couple of forms. Then provided me 85% of the total vat. She paid me in cash USD. Entire process took 10 minutes. That's all.

 Decent storage space because I need to keep a spare helmet + my bag and other stuff

 Not too expensive like SH

 Edit. Sorry did not mean to god gift. His exact words were "god give ba boy or girl or gay ba love all".

I used to write about food and honestly if it’s a popular dish I’ve probably tried it! 
 Im curious to try some more niche dishes - things you don’t see every day. Perhaps specialities from remote areas. Something like cơm hến in Huế, for example.

I'm seeking advice on the optimal departure time from Hoi An at night, wondering when Grab taxi services typically stop operating in the area.
 The intent is to maximise night time at Hoi An because I have heard the city is very charming at night but I can’t stay in Hoi an and have to come back to Danang at night.
 Additionally, I'd like to know if traveling at night in this route is considered safe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I was job hunting, and this company (they claimed they're Vissan which is a decently big Food product company in Vietnam) contacted me. They sent an email for a physical interview that is set for this weekend, in the meanwhile they did this "online prequalification" that has to go through Telegram.
 The first part of this bullcrap is an MBTI test(?) that contains only like 5 questions. Am I that out of touched to the HR world that MBTI is a standard thing now?
 The second part is the relatively well-known scam that has been floating around recently, which is inputting data and get money from a lottery platform, all in the guys of "making extra revenue". First they sent me 150k to add to the platform, so I played along for a bit, got 330k in return. They seems to be impressed that they started telling me about the 4 tiers of data entry, which basically is an ever increasing amount of money in return for a (supposedly) even higher amount. Of course that first run was a trial period, the 2nd run will be a 40-60 shares of profit for the company. And on top of it, the lowest tier they put up is 600k, which is just above the amount that I just earned, which means I have to pour money out of my own pocket for them.
 Here's where I cut things off. This is too many red flags with screaming horns in my head. No fucking way a company would take money from their applicants. The funniest thing is that they even have the audacity to breath out that sentence I screenshotted above. I guess taking 330k from them is not much but it still filled my pettiness with something close to pride.
 So tl;dr: I have an encounter with a scam group that masquerading as a legit company. Took some money from them instead.

 I have plan to come to vietnam second time. i want to cook some korean food for bf extended family. My favorite one is Gopchang (grilled pork and beef intestines)
 I asked bf, but he said it’s not popular. I guess he just wants me to persuade me to cook another dishes, because he can not eat intestines 😚😙😗
 If you guys eat intestines, what is your favorite type of cooking? In Korea, we often do barbecue (grill). Are there any Korean dishes, which Vietnamese people love? I’m willing to learn and cook for them
 Last time, I asked “how to impress viet parents” in this sub. Your suggestions helped me a lot, and I was successful. Thank you 🙏 🙏

My kids chomped right down into it, assuming it was a hard candy intentionally placed at the center of this soft jelly-like candy. I just had a crown placed so no way I’m biting something this hard, haha!
 Any idea what the kernel is? I tried to take a picture of it (2nd photo). Many thanks in advance!

 I'm not interested in raising animosities but would like to learn more about the era and see if others are searching or have their own family stories from the era as there's word from a grandparent's grandparent that some relatives were captured and sent there. 
 Are there any Vietnamese memorials, communities in Reunion Island or organizations dedicated to those who were stolen as a result?

 My name’s Dom and I’m part of an all asian theater collective based in Montreal! 
 We are travelling to Vietnam to do research for our next show. We will be in Hanoi from October 24 to 29 and Saigon from 29 to the 2!
 I was wondering if you guys had any theater plays or concerts we could go to while we are there!
 I’ve looked at the productions at the Saigon Opera House but, we’re looking for something a bit more contemporary/avant-garde if that’s possible! 
 Anyways, if you have any artistic recommandations (contemporary danse shows, art museums, alternative music, great coffee shops, librairies,etc..) or are an artist in Vietnam, it would be amazing to connect! 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question might be silly but I’m just curious. I’m watching Young Sheldon (the series is set in Medford, Texas in the 80s-90s btw), and Sheldon has a Vietnamese friend named Tam. His mom always packs dimsum for him, to the point he’s sick of it.
 Dimsum is generally a Chinese food. I know we have dimsum here too but it’s still thought of as a Chinese food, or đồ Hoa.
 So my question is, do Vietnamese Americans have dim sum for lunch that often too? Or is it just another case of filmmakers/showrunners mixing up Asian people and following stereotypes?
 Again, this is just me contemplating about things in life. No big deal either way. So let me know your perspective. Thank you.

 Im coming to Vietnam, to Ho Chi Minh 11th October, and I'm really confused. We have 11 days available and we returning to the same airport. My question is: What to do there? :) I had a lot of work before holiday and I couldn't prepare for this. Im starting now :) 
 I was wondering about rental motorbike, but im not sure cause im going with my girlfriend and we have 2 big backpacks. What do you think guys?
 And im looking for something special, im not big fan of architecture, rather we prefer local experience and nature. I don't like the crowds too, but I know that's normal in big cities and popular attractions. 
 ​
 In short - can you give us some hidden gems? And what do you think about rental 2 bikes ( My GF is driver too) and traveling from Ho Chi Minh to Hoi An. Or maybe we should take a plane and rent bikes there? And last but not least - weather. Im a little nervous when I see a forecast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As per title, recently those type of questions pop up rather frequently in this sub to the point I find it unreasonable. 
 The more of those questions pop up and the more I read into it, the less I see it is related to the Vietnamese country/ the culture/ the people.
 It might only have to do with that particular, very specific family/ relationship/ situation being in question. Regardless the whole nation is called into question for some behavior.
 You guys do know that Vietnam is a country of over 100m population, with polarized income and living conditions, plus having worldwide diasporas (in North America, Australia, European continent, African continent, East Asia, the Middle East) so finding an average Nguyen is nigh impossible, right???
 Instead of asking “Why my Vietnamese relative treat me like shit?” or “Why Vietnamese male drink coffee all morning and doesn’t go to work?” People can rephrase it such as “why my relative treat me like shit?” - does the fact that they are Vietnamese or Vietnamese immigrants play any roles in the question?

Initially, my father didn't want any part of me when my mother got pregnant because I was an accident. He impregnated my mom when he was 25, and she was 15. Before I was born, he tried to persuade my mom to have an abortion. I met him for the first time at the age of 5 and then reconnected with the family at the age of 12. My stepmom is mostly the reason why I wasn't around, as my father lied to her and never disclosed my existence until my mom basically gave him an ultimatum to accept me as his son. If he didn't, she would take him to court for child support, which she did, and he paid until I turned 18. My stepmom is also the reason I re-entered the family …]]></summary>

 My father teaches me that it’s a woman’s job to take care of the household and the kids. Meanwhile he expects me to do a master’s degree and work full time as well. He teaches me things like: - It’s fine for men to have a high body count before marriage but girls should keep themselves pure - It’s a woman’s job to do the cooking, cleaning, etc. (including things like having to cut my husband’s finger and toe nails) - I shouldn’t do a doctor’s degree because men are deterred from women with higher education - It’s justified if my husband cheats if I don’t provide him with a warm meal and children
 My mother works full time as well but he feels entitled to everything she does for him. If there’s no food or the food is too salty for example, he starts to shout and says “without me, you would be living in the streets.”
 Is that normal for our Vietnamese culture? I’ve never seen him grateful for how we support him.

 My best friend and I haven't seen each other for years (we live in different countries now) and we're thinking of travelling and reuniting in Vietnam. 
 We both would like to indulge ourselves in Vietnam's food and culture. We both enjoy long walks, have some drinks, and trying out some things new! (something more "local" and maybe not too touristy haha)
 Any recommendations and suggestions are highly appreciated. Thank you! :)

Looking at a lot of reddit posts I'll probably bring some sandals (maybe Columbia Breaksiders?) for light walks and water activities but I will also go to Sa Pa and other places where I would like to hike. Since the weather won't be as hot as in the summer, do you guys think some light hiking boots would be a good idea as a second pair and if so do you have any suggestions (I looked at the Merrell Nova 3 Mid for example)? I like hiking shoes that go over your ankles to prevent injuries on rugged terrain.
 Thank you guys in advance!

 After reading that it’s not uncommon for foreign bank cards to not work at some ATMs, I laced up my walking shoes and tried literally 17 ATMs, all unsuccessfully. I always tried 2 mil, I tried adding money to my USD wallet, I tried walking to the CitiBank atm, nothing. Eventually I went to the Wise website to see if something was locked with my card and I stumbled on a support page that listed countries that US accounts won’t work in. 
 I have a card from my US bank so I’ll probably just take the fee on the chin or consider using the Western Union app to send myself some money in the morning.

 I have a plan to come back to my country and work there for a long time. I asked my gf, and she agreed to relocate with me. We’ll move to vn in February next year. I am happy she’s willing to follow me. But I’m worried that she may struggle to adapt to living and workenvironment in Vietnam.
 As a foreigner living vn, what were your difficulties in living and working? Esp female foreigners (female and male may have different concerns). How did you overcome them?
 What can I do to help her go through tough time? She doesn’t need to worry about money, living place. We only care how she can get a good job, have positive experience and avoid being culture shocked or anxious
 She wants to learn the language. Can you suggest any language centers or tutors teaching foreigners Vietnamese?
 Any Vietnamese or foreigner having the same situation here, can you share your experience? I appreciate all your suggestions!!!!
 You may wonder why I don’t stay in Canada. I actually got PR of Canada. I am working for an American firm. The company is building a new factory in a north province of vietnam. I was chosen to work as one of managers in that factory, because I can speak the language. I will work in my home country like “expat” 😂😂. This is also a good chance for me to make a big chunk of money.😁

 Any usual pitfalls/quirks about landlords and realtors? Should something be explicitly checked for and settled at the contract stage? Are large deposits and commissions common?
 Any info from your experience would be of a great help :)
 I will be most likely settling in District 7, since thats where my office will be, and hearing that its a lot more spacious, green and unconjested compared to the center districts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always wondered why the Viets always drive in different lanes at the same exact speed in highways and express ways (including big fucking trucks staying in all the lanes, super frustrating but never mind), and after watching this video I realize it's a bigger problem that it's affecting many other countries, even the US
 Since I'm from the EU, I had no idea how it worked elsewhere, but it's just common sense in the EU to not stay constantly in the left lane unless I'm passing someone else. I believe in some countries you can get even fined if you occupy the left lane for no reason 
 Do you believe a culture of left lane for passing only can be adopted here? Or is it too late now to create such culture? (talking about the highways reserved for cars only, not the normal roads)

I love Vietnamese food (Banh Mi, soups and salads) and excited to try authentic fare as well as experience the culture. Some of my questions and concerns needing answers from travelers who have been there: -Visa. I believe visitors will need a visa to enter. Could anyone share the link to apply for the visa application? Can it be an online application, how much and how long to get the visa. -Money to get around. Are credit cards accepted or only cash? -Wifi access. Would getting a local SIM to access the internet be the best way? Do the Vietnamese telcos offer inexpensive prepaid SIMs and roughly how much? -Must sees and do's in Ho Chi Minh. Recommended places of interest to see and unique experiences would be great. -Souvenirs. What's good to bring home from Vietnam? I would appreciate your practical tips and suggestions. Thanks in advance.

I routinely find the process of asking a question and receiving a response from Vietnamese people to be painful. The same goes for politely declining invitations. I say no politely time after time after time and it doesn't seem like anyone hears me unless I get animated, frustrated, exasperated, or leave. The same goes for answering questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 As the title says, I got an offer from ILA for Can Tho! On the surface, things sound pretty decent, especially since they offer a housing allowance. 
 My pay according to the contract (before taxes) is 473,000 VND an hour (20 teaching hours a week), on top of a housing allowance of 7,000,000 VND per month. It's a standard 12-month contract. 
 My main priorities are to learn how to be a good teacher, save as much as I can, and try to avoid stress as much as possible. That being said, I want to make sure ILA is a good fit for me. I don't mind the region I'm staying in (Can Tho) since I doubt I'm gonna leave my apartment much... for me, the priority is just learning a local culture and saving money. 
 Does anyone have any experiences with ILA that they'd be willing to share? I understand that avoiding stress is impossible as a teacher, but I just want to make sure that they've got a good support system in place. The last thing I want is to be overworked or overwhelmed with stuff that they didn't mention in the interview or the contract... only to realize I could've had that same experience here, in the states. 
 Long story shrot, this is the only offer I think I'll be getting from Vietnam... and I'm stuck between taking it and just giving up and sticking to living in the states. I don't want to go overseas and get burned out on teaching since I'm gonna be doing that for a living... 
 Please let me know, thank you.

(which i didn't make). To be honest i think they got a hold of my credit card information and now i have to dispute this. I just thought i'd share this so please be careful and aware everybody. 
 It's in D1 , and the credit card dispute team can't help me right now at the moment because of the time zone differences so I'll have to wait until night time to settle this . 
 This really sucks, but i would share this because I wouldn't want anybody to deal with a situation like this, especially overseas.

 French police announced that they stopped a refrigerated truck on September 27 on the E15 highway near Drace, north of Lyon and discovered 6 women, including 4 Vietnamese and two Iraqis, in the cramped trunk full of bananas. BBC reported on September 28.
 Laetitia Francart, prosecutor of the Villefranche-sur-Saone region, north of the city of Lyon, eastern France, said the group of women got into the back of a truck with Irish license plates hoping to reach Britain or Ireland.

 Are older Vietnamese parents actually into PBN and secretly would love to go? Or do they not really care for the program all too much?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like seriously, today I walked into a post in this sub. And it reeks with colonial mentality. This has been a serious issue I have with my fellow Vietnamese in a long time. So, I would like to hear your opinions about it today.
 I would like to start with my first experience with this issue. After I finished with my university, I got hired into a Vietnamese branch of a Japanese self-driving car start up. Things were fine back then except for one thing. My CEO. He was a total Japanese-supremacy guy (He is Vietnamese, btw). One day, me and my senior had to work overtime to fix some issues that the our Japanese colleagues made. It was a mismanagement problem, so while we were okay with working overtime to fix it, we thought it would be more productive to raise this problem in the next meeting…]]></summary>

 Xin chào mọi người, post này tôi sẽ nói tiếng Việt.
 Gần đây… không hẳn là thời gian gần đây nữa mà là hơn 8 tháng rồi… đã xảy ra một vụ án thương tâm tại Chung cư Centana ở thủ đức. Nạn nhân ở đây là người phụ nữ Phan Thị Mỹ Hằng.
 Thoạt đầu tưởng rằng chỉ là trò bịp bợm của ai đó trên mạng nhưng hóa ra không phải. Khi thấy điểm bất ngờ nên tôi đã nghiên cứu qua thử thì thấy có rất nhiều điểm đáng để nói trong vụ án lần này.
 Trước khi tới tình tiết phân tích chuyên sâu, nếu ai đã đọc quyển sách Đêm trường tăm tối của Tử Kim Trần thì sẽ thấy sự giống y hệt xã hội chúng ta đang sống hiện tại. Càng đọc, càng thấy sự na ná và tôi mong nếu bạn đang đọc đến dòng này, thì hãy đọc tiếp vì bạn sẽ cảm thấy bất ngờ.
 Vụ án kể về hơn một chục năm trước, tại…]]></summary>

 It would also be greatly appreciated if yall can give me some recommendations on airlines that will be allowing pets. I'm coming from Canada and it looks like I will be transferring through an intermediate airport. Last time I checked Taiwan doesn't allow live animals in so Eva Air is cancelled out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Asking for a friend...
 What are the realistic job opportunities in HCMC and/or Hanoi for someone who speaks neither English nor Vietnamese? More specifically, for someone who speaks Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese (has Italian and Brazilian citizenship), and who has work experience in programming, IT, and graphic design, and also has "uncertified" skills in construction and furniture building? 
 I know that being a Digital Nomad or working remotely for a European country are obvious answers, but I'm wondering about on-the-ground, potentially Visa-sponsored gigs? I do not yet live in Vietnam, so when I search on my Dell from the USA, even if I search in Spanish (my second language), my results are highly skewed and unhelpful.
 If anyone has links, knows of good recruiting companies, or anything, I'd greatly appreciate it! Equally, if the answer is that my friend would be SOL, thank you for the frankness 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There seems to be a lot of regional variation. I think the standard rule (if there is such a thing), is to use the same address (anh, chi, em) based on one's own sibling's age. But what about if the husband or wife of your sibling is younger than you? In most traditions, you still follow the "standard rules", but I've met people who address the younger (in age) sibling-in-law as "chu, cau, co, di", as though they were addressing them in place of their children. What tradition do you follow, dear Redditors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a brother. My dad mentioned him once when I was young, didn’t bring him up for years, then finally told me about him again and confirmed it wasn’t a fever dream. 
 My brother would be in his mid to late thirties. My dad was half white and was kicked out of the hospital by my brother’s grandma. He wasn’t allowed to see his son after that. My dad eventually made it to America but has always missed my brother. My grandma did not know of my brother because he was born out of wedlock. I accidentally let it slip. 
 I’m contemplating doing a DNA test and potentially finding him. I want to do an American one as well since my grandpa (my dads father) was a lieutenant during the war. Though, I do want to meet my brother the most. To let him know my dad didn’t willingly abandon him. Have them meet. Help my grandma meet her first grandchild as she always thought I was the first. 
 If anyone has any insight, that’ll be extremely helpful. Thank you.
 Edit: when I ask, “do people in Vietnam do these tests” it’s because I’m asking if it’s commonplace and if it’s as popular in other countries. I want to see if there is any percentage of a chance it’ll work.

 That said, I have one major point of complaint: the state of infrastructure - in particular - transport infrastructure - in the country, is totally unacceptable. 
 Now I know Vietnam is still a relatively poor country, and is still significantly behind the likes of Thailand or Malaysia in economic development (although it is progressing rapidly). But even for a country at its income level (real per capita GDP of $15k), it’s still not good enough. And fixing it will be crucial if Vietnam is to have sustainable long run economic success and capitalise on current investment…]]></summary>

However, I just got the result this morning. Guess what, I got 6 with an overall score of 7. It took me 2 months to reach this score, and I’m so f cheerful about it. Anyway, i just want to spread my happiness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Idk if this is the right place to post here. I feel like Zalo’s the most popular messaging app in Vietnam so maybe the story would make sense to some here, to some extent. 
 For context: I broke up with my ex over 3 years ago and we haven’t talked ever since. It was a peaceful, face-to-face breakup. When we were together she made an IG for me bc I didn’t use IG (she only posted fluffy lovey dovey stuff of us there, I didn’t have access to it). I have been together with my current gf for almost 2 years. 
 For the main story, I was using my gf’s phone and while on her app switcher screen, I saw she was browsing my ex-made instagram account on Zalo browser. I got startled and immediately went to the Zalo app to see how she came across it. 
 Apparently “I” was the one who sent it to her on Zal…]]></summary>

Are lotto ticket sellers basically verified as poor and are given those tickets by the government to sell? They only get a commission per ticket so it's better for them if I just give them the cash and let them keep the ticket?
 I've also been told to avoid giving money to women carrying drugged babies and children selling stuff, particularly around Bui Vien they are owned by mafia and don't get to keep the money themselves/ aren't allowed go to school.
 Correct me if I'm wrong with anything as I'm only going off what I'm told.

 My recently purchased Galaxy S23 on the US Verizon network won't unlock automatically for another month. Verizon refuses to do it before then. I want to use a local sim when I arrive on Friday but would need to get the phone unlocked. 
 I'll be staying in D1 on PNL. Any recommendations for some place that can network-unlock my phone for me?
 Thanks everyone!
 Edit: I would like a local phone number so I can use Grab.

 I'm a pretty experienced motorbike driver, but before wandering to this side of the world, I did not ask for my international driving permit. I do have valid national driving license for motorcycles of all cc, but legally that is worthless in Vietnam.
 My question is simple: how risky is it if I try to do the Ha Chiang Loop on my own, without an IDP? Are there mandatory checks somewhere? Are they somehow skippable?
 I understand that this is at all NOT recommended, but desperate times call for desperate means. And driving experience is not an issue, really.
 I'm eager to hear your experience, but I guess it's more valuable if you didn't take a big group tour. I'd really prefer doing this on my own.
 Cheers and happy travels!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, due to multiple issues( weak health, financial burden, etc) I decided to take break for a year and today was the first day I started going to college. However, after a whole day of studying I felt drained? And I have a feeling that applying to college was a huge mistake or something. I'm think about withdrawing my college tuition fees if this keeps going on in the future.
 I applied to the Diplomatic Acedamy of Vietnam(DAV) by the way. Was it because I took a break for so long that I've grown accustomed to being lazy all day? Or was it something else? DAV is famous for having cut-throat competitive environment so maybe that's why? I felt totally intimidated by the environment. Maybe it was a huge mistake applying here. Deep down I have always had the desire to run away from society and become a hermit or a beggar so that I can get this mental turmoil off my head.
 I know some of you might think that I am being childish or immature but really, it got so bad that I quitted everything for a whole year and stayed at home doing nothing but house chores and walking around the neighborhood. Honestly I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me anymore. I am thinking of using my remaining savings to... run away somewhere before... committing suicide.

 I like a mix of things when travelling, the most important being: Local food and culture, nightlife (bars), local sporting events, beaches, cultural history, and potentially bringing my golf clubs. I've been looking at staying in Hanoi for a week and then heading to Ha Long Bay.
 I've also been reading about starting in HCMC and making my way up through Da Nang/Hoi An. I'm not huge into spending days travelling, so was wonder if people have input on HCMC and surrounding areas vs Hanio and surrounding?

There don’t appear to be any rules, not sure why an effort was even made to paint lanes, and traffic lights are simply a suggestion. In spite of all of this, everyone seems to navigate the roads in a chaotic harmony. After the initial terror of crossing a street, my wife has embraced the chaos and now takes joy in pointing out the motorbike with six kegs on it or the man somehow carrying an entire workshop on his back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Or are you not allowed to?
 Last week my dad got hospitalized due to suspision of streptococcus suis contraction. Still to today they havent (or dont) tell him if he actually has it or not or what he actually has regardless of his repeated inquiries and their repeated blood tests.
 Same story early this year, at a different hospital. My mom got a "heart situation" and we called for an ambulance. On the way to the hospital the ER people said it was a myocardial infarction (heart attack). However, the doctorS (stress on plural cause multiple of them reviewed her case and i saw it) said they "dont think" that's the case. They suspect it to be a heart failure, "maybe" caused by either hypotension or hypoglycemia. Thats about everything they ever said during an entire week she was there.
 Well, here I am half a year later and still have no clue what actually happened to my mother and how i could prevent it from happening again. Cause they dont tell me or her or my dad. They just said dont worry rest well blah blah. They dont even give us the medical record, just a prescription paper in which it said thats the illness were "related to coronary artery disease and other types of diabetes".
 So why cant you tell us whats wrong with us? You cant or you're not allowed to? Is it a personal thing or a professional thing? Is it a public vs private hospital thing? Or you cant be bothered to talk to us cause you're too busy?
 PS: please people in the comments, im really concerned about my parents and them keep being kept in the dark. Im not trying to be smart or condescending or presumptious. If you live in HCMC and know a hospital with high quality transparant service, do tell me.
 Tldr: my parents have been hospitalized on 2 seperate occasions and nobody ever told them what they actually have.

 Just that I didn't want to pack these things while coming and increase my luggage resulting in paying extra airline charges. I would be in your debt if there's some suggestion on this.
 So basically, I want to buy a jacket in Vietnam, use it and then sell it back in Vietnam itself.
 Had added this as a comment in the pinned thread but didn't get any reply so posting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so i am having my first solo travel in November.
 At the moment I scheduled 25 days in Vietnam. However from viewing different itineraries and youtube videos I was kina turned off by south Vietnam.
 My main priorities are breathtaking nature and sporty/extreme activities, like ziplines, surfing, diving.
 I don't care for big cities ,cultural tours, partying and craftsmentship workshops (which i heared there are a lot of in Hoi-an). Originally I was planning to go with my girlfriend, and these activities are fun as a couple, but I just don't think I will enjoy them as a solo traveler.
 I have read that north Vietnam's nature is amazing and compared to it South Vietnam is underwhelming and has more of the content that i am less inclined towards.
 Therefore I am considering the option of doing about 2 weeks in North Vietnam, focusing on the Loop, The caves, Sapa etc, and then transfering for a short diving/surfing vacation in the phillipins(which excites me but I was originally fine to give up to travel with my ex-gf) . I thought about Thailand as well but i had been there a few years ago. I might be able to add a few days to a week to my trip for that.
 I would love to hear about if someone thinks the plan is feasible / change my mind regarding south Vietnam/ present another option (Cambodia?)
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I will be traveling to Vietnam in November and I will mostly stay in the North of Vietnam (Ha Giang, Sapa, Ha Long Bay, Ninh Binh) where the weather will be nice. I love outdoor stuff like hiking and trekking and therefore I would love to visit Phong Nha Ke Bang national park (it looks absolutely stunning!) and do an overnight trekking tour there. However, it seems that the national park is located in central Vietnam where November is part of the raining season. As a result Oxalis is not offering a lot of tours but I found another organization (Jungle Boss) that is offering several tours, even in caves. 
 I’ve been trying to find out how bad it really is in November based on the experiences of other travelers and information on websites, but I’m getting lots of contradictory results. Is it a 100% chance of rain every day and should I be expecting rain all day long? Or should I expect some short (but intense) showers every day and is there also chance to see some sun? 
 Also, when I look up temperatures most websites mention temperatures between 66°F (19°C) to 75°F (24°C), however, on other websites I read that it can get unbearably cold during the night. It’s very confusing as I would not describe 20 degrees Celsius as unbearably cold. 
 I know it would be best to come back to Vietnam for the central part another time, but I don’t think I’ll be back in Vietnam soon as there are so many other places on my travel bucket list as well. And I also know that the weather can’t be predicted but it would be great to hear at least some real experiences from other travelers in November. Not just in Ke Bang national park but experiences from central Vietnam in general will be appreciated.
 (My native language is not English, sorry for any misspelling)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am planning a trip to Vietnam + Cambodia for 2 weeks second half of April. Hanoi (w/ Halong Bay + Ninh Binh), Siem Reap + Angkor Wat, and Hoi An. 
 How does the burning season (in N Thailand/Chiang Mai and other parts of SEA) affect Vietnam and Cambodia? I was seeing some pictures of Halong Bay from this past April and it looks super hazy, the skies aren’t blue, which got me wondering. I would like to have good visibility especially for the traveling and cruise and our time in Ninh Binh and Angkor Wat especially. Would love any feedback or thoughts or even a better time to go (I haven’t booked flights yet). Was thinking about pushing it to May but May looks so hot!
 Thank you!!!

As a local who takes out friends often from different parts of the World, I got tired of telling them to avoid Ben Thanh market and lots of those tourist trap places that bloggers fall for. So after taking out numerous friends out and their friends of friends. I decided to share my experiences and best places in Youtube. I also wanted to capture how the life of a local is living here in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City).

 I submitted my e-visa application on September 15th, still waiting for it to come back. It still says it’s “processing” My wife and son got theirs back like 5 days ago. We’re in Thailand waiting to go to Vietnam, we’re just about to pull the plug on the trip. It’s weird and a pretty dumb, imo that you can’t submit these as a family so they are processed together.

 Does anyone have any experience attending any such school for the summer, or any programs of the sort. 
 I see there are some options for international schools with camps and activity components, like AIS and ISHCMC.
 Just wanted to ask the community in the event there were other local programs not showing up on search results that folks can recommend or can share their personal experience of having gone through.

At first I didn't realize why every time I had tortilla chips in the back of the shop, they would always get eaten by the end of the business day. Nobody would ask me to eat my snacks/dinners/etc. This never bugged me but it did always cross my mind when I would go to take my food home and there was no food left! It now appears to me, having been to a recent work banquet, where my co-workers grabbed several smaller bowls and placed different variations of their pho and egg noodles for me to taste. And it doesn't stop there, they always offer me to try new things. From desserts with potato to different variations of noodles. I'm happy to be here, what can I do to express my gratitude?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I traveled to Vietnam and only went to Hue/Hoi An/Da nang. 
 They are all very good cities in central Vietnam. My favorite is Da nang! When you go to Hue, you can see the ancient Hue Imperial City and the famous Temple. You can walk by the river during the day and go to nearby bars to drink and listen to songs at night. It is a very pleasant life.
 The day and night in Hoi An Ancient Town are particularly attractive. Walk around the ancient town during the day, go to a nearby coffee shop for a cup of coffee and some cake. You can also go to the riverside at night, and both sides are very beautiful! There are many famous restaurants nearby! My favorite coffee shop is Mia Coffee. Their cakes are very delicious and the coffee is also great. It should be reminded that Hoi An's consumption is higher than that of Hue and even in Da nang, which may be due to tourist cities! What you get with the same money is not worth it! But this is the reason why it is a tourist city. It should be noted that there are some stores that do not indicate the price, and the boss may overpay tourists!
 I mainly went to Monkey Mountain and the Pink Church in Da nang, as well as the Cham Sculpture Museum. If you are interested in Cham culture, you can go and have a look! Very good! You can also go to the holy places of Meishan, which are some historical relics of Hinduism. The night in Da nang is beautiful! There are many lively bars where you can go for a drink. However, I ended up spending time at the Hilton Hotel in Da nang. During the day, I also went to the beach for a drink, ate some snacks, and lay on the beach chair to read. It was very comfortably. The executive lounge of the Hilton Hotel is also very good! You can eat very delicious food at 6 p.m.! There are also bartenders to drink! The staff is great!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just saw the news about a house collapsing in Saigon and I went down a rabbit hole of houses collapsing when the house next to it starts their construction. Just wondering, is the quality of houses good here? what's the reason? is it the skills of the construction worker? old houses in general? Can anyone in construction tell me the process? Do you guys do third party auditing?

 I’m really into history if that’s relevant and seeing the tunnels is a must.

I was standing by a roller coaster taking a picture when I noticed something flying past me and I tried to block it out of my way but cannot recall if I touched it or if it touched me. Later on I saw small things flying in the air that looked like bats but not 100% sure if these were bats as they were pretty small. The locals didn’t seem concerned around them at all. Should I get the vaccine. I checked my skin and didn’t notice any scratches or bites and do not recall actually touching it.

 Any recommendations where I should stay?
 I like beaches but don’t want a boring or very touristic neighborhood. Somewhere where I can go to gym, cafes, socialize, work a bit and then go to the beach maybe 20-30 minutes away from home.
 I do not mind a warm rain but I don’t want to end up in the most rainy location. I read that rainy season starts in some areas in November.
 Not a party person but I would prefer an active neighborhood where I can meet new people. 
 Thanks

I happen to fall into that category perfectly, and I was considering planning a 2 week trip to go sightseeing next year.
 Is the attitude hostile at all, or will people generally be welcoming while I travel? I’ve never been to Vietnam before, so will be good to know what to expect.

 I'll be honest that I'm not sure what much of it was, but I do know that it contained: shrimp, rice noodles, pork belly, and chilli stuffed with mackerel, something crunchy yet chewy, and also two other types of seafood I can't identify. 
 I also have no idea what anything in the other bowls are, but they tasted very refreshing - especially with this lovely green bowl of sauce they bought over shortly after.
 I highly recommend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: I genuinely love kids. I don't mean to offend anyone by judging the children, but I'd like to hear your opinion.
 I usually visit certain coffee shops on the weekends to find new inspiration and refresh my mind. I tend to be more creative in such places. Lately, I've been frequenting The Coffee House due to its spacious and comfortable ambiance for working. However, I've encountered some issues with families that bring their children, typically around 3 to 5 years old. These kids never sit still, always yelling and running around without much supervision from their parents. Moreover, the parents in these families tend to speak loudly, trying to overcome the noise created by their children, and sometimes they reprimand their children when they glance at the kids attempting to break something. This results in a significant amount of chaos, which can be quite anxious. It feels more like a kindergarten than a place for adults.
 I want to emphasize once again that I'm not passing judgment on the children or their parents. However, from my perspective, it appears that the awareness of some individuals nowadays is somewhat lacking, and this could potentially have a negative impact on their children's behavior and attitudes (It is actually occurring now)
 Peace.

 I experience these requests repeatedly "cancel, help me", while the app might say "you will wait for drivers longer now, because you cancel the rides". Plus any bonus applied to the ride might not be applied the second time.

Ive been to another 3rd country like colombia which makes total sense $40 usd to $100 a bottle but It makes no sense especially in Saigon. Can someone explain to me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few times now I have been offered to drink beer with older Vietnamese men (& Filipino but doesn’t matter for this post).
 Does this happen to anyone else often? How do you handle it? 
 The first time, I said sure (with family members of my partner). It turned into a multiple hour feast and drink till you pass out on the karaoke mic. The only strange part was no common language the entire time. 
 For this, is why I usually try to turn this opportunity down even though i feel so bad for doing so. I’m all for being invited to have some food, but drinking gets crazy with the Vietnamese haha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1980s, when Vietnamese Boat People successfully crossed the border, they flooded refugee camps in Southeast Asia. Ms. Ann An Phuong Nguyen (formerly known as Ann Cusack), a teacher in Australia, was just 20 years old at the time. She followed her conscience, leaving her hometown, family and prosperous life. to go to refugee camps to help Vietnamese refugees who have just escaped the country. During 7 consecutive years of volunteer service, she took care of many refugee children and taught English in refugee camps in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. During VHM's Gala program on Sunday, September 17, 2023, the Vietnamese Heritage Museum (VHM) was honored to present Ms. Ann Cusack with the VHM Humanitarian Award, as a special way to respectfully acknowledge her love. Her personal love was demonstrated by her tireless and dedicated service to many Boat People during her years of service in Southeast Asian refugee camps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been visiting Vietnam for a while and I've noticed that on a lot of places, from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh, a lot of people actually live where they work. I'm not talking about the small family business though - I've seen that in good hotels, restaurants, etc. I've seen workers working during the day and then going to sleep on the business' basement or on the building's last floor. I've accidentally even gone to the basement of some of these hotels and seen someone living there with a kitchen everything.
 Is this common practice? If yes, why? And is it legal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve noticed that lots of Vietnamese American content that shows up on my feed tends to be of a shallower substance. It’s mostly food and comedy about stereotypes, which isn’t inherently bad but…sometimes it leaves me craving more depth.
 I’ve been lucky enough to learn how to play the đàn nguyệt and be exposed to different styles of traditional Vietnamese music. My favorite by far is nhạc cung đình Huế and ca Huế. I’ll never get over how Lưu thủy kim tiền flows or the swaying of Nữ sinh đồng Khánh (I know this is more recent) set to the accompaniment of traditional instruments.
 I really like profiles like this one and it’d be nice to be more exposed to creators that highlight more diverse perspectives on our culture.

 However, I also plan to take advantage of the opportunity to experience Vietnamese culture, including the communist/socialist culture.
 Is it permitted to openly display communist/socialist culture in Vietnam? By communist/socialist culture, I mean an overt display of icons connected to communism. For example, am I allowed to wear the military cap with a red star? Am I allowed to pose with Ho Chi Minh's monument with my left fist raised?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I told my mother that I'm gay, but ever since I was born I have longed to become a father, nurturing and protecting a child. But instead of going the traditional route of marrying heterosexual, or partnering with a lesbian couple, I wanna do the better thing of adopting a child. 
 Heck, even if I'm heterosexual I would still choose to adopt a child. There's a lot of children needing a home, if you want a child just adopt them, why create for yourself the trouble of having to deal with weddings, the wife's family side and stuff. Beside, you have the time to connect to a kid before deciding you could bond with it or not
 But my mother, told me that I'm crazy and a non blood-related child could never be loyal to me, and always leave me in the end. I told her that I want to father a child not to have someone to take care of me, but to have the feeling that If I were to pass away, I have done something right with my life. I don't know how to explain this, but it's like I will live my whole life accumulating money, knowledge and experiences, and it would feel like it'll be all for nothing if I won't spend all of those things on helping and nurturing someone else. It would feel like my all of those things is wasted somehow
 What do your parents and Vietnamese people around think about child adoption? What do you yourself think about it?

I know i'm not good enough to take responsible for such a huge commitment ( i'm not grown up enough ), not at least until i can provide for myself. We had a lot of arguments that i should accept the fact that she might leave me as she wants the best thing for her. Since then, she changed, the way she loved, the way she talked, everything must be exactly what she wants so she can trust that i'm good enough to be the one for her. Not until a lot of pressures i've been through recently, even when she is one of the biggest pressure feel, now i cant take it anymore, just want to kill myself sometimes. Not even mentioned of the things she wanted me to become when she won't accept me for who i am. I cried so much i start losing sleep, losing hairs,... However, she still cares for me, make me feel comfortable and she points out the best in me.
 What should i do when breaking up with my gf is the best thing for both of us but we love each other so much, i know it, i'm just too selfish to admit that to let her go...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I only got to spend a week there, and I did a lot of typical tourist activities. I'm American, but I actually went on vacation visiting from China back in 2019. I had been living in Beijing for a year. Beijing is a tier 1 Chinese city, but the vibe is... depressing. People generally look unhappy and stoic, similar to Soviet style culture I suppose. Chinese are inoffensive in customer service, but just... cold. When I landed in Hanoi, which is supposedly the conservative part of Vietnam, the difference was night and day. Interactions with hotel workers, restaurant workers etc was warm and welcoming. English was spoken widely, which again is total opposite of Beijing. What struck me the most was the energy. You could "feel" the progress in the air, like it was an up place where the best is yet to come. I heard China had a similar vibe in the early 2000s. Contrast with China now tho, which by 2019 had already apexed and was showing clear signs of decline. I stayed at a Hilton in the center of Hanoi and it was buzzing with business travelers. Clearly it's a growing hub of activity. I also did a junk boat trip in ha long bay, and the guy on the boat was talking about how better life has gotten in just the last 5 years. From the warm locals, to the food (tho I'll be honest Hanoi food wasn't that great, but the street food was fun and cheap... heard HCM is the place to go for food), the vibe in the air, Vietnam stole my heart and I can't wait to return. I've been to well over a dozen countries and lived in 4 continents. I would absolutely love to spend a year or two in Vietnam as it rapidly transforms and grows it's presence on the global stage. I wish you all success, I know life isn't easy for all, but as someone who's "been around the block", Vietnam is special. Keep doing what you do.

 I’ve heard anecdotal information about issues such as pollution, human trafficking, mental illness, etc. What I hope to do is identify where to prioritize my efforts in order to efficiently contribute toward a cause.
 Thank you.

 I read online that Red-shanked doucs can be seen on the Son Tra peninsula. Is it only place where I can see them or is there some better place? On the Son Tra peninsula, do I need to take tour guide or can I just walk/drive around. Are there some good spots or hiking trails where to watch them?
 I couldn't find much information regarding Gibbons. I know about the gibbon treks in Cat Tien but I read mixed reviews about it. Is there some better place where to see them?(preferably in central/ south Vietnam)
 Thank you.

 I bought a simcard (viettel) at the airport like a week ago and received a lot of messages which I ignored because I can’t read vietnamese.
 However this simcard doesn’t work anymore. I went to a smartphone store but they couldn’t help me out.
 Can someone tell me how to proceed in this case?

I am trying to learn as many useful words and phrases as I can before January but it is a very complicated language! My husband and I want to spend a month in Vietnam but are unsure in which city. Hanoi, Da Nang and HCMC all seem like they would be lovely and great places to visit but I am very worried about being able to communicate. Do many people in these cities speak english? Will people be offended by my having to use google translate? Is it possible to travel to the country and manage without speaking Vietnamese ?
 I greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically I work in a restaurant in Hanoi, whenever a customer take a seat, I'll ask them how many people they go with, is it one or two
 I noticed a thing that with middle age customers, like 40 years old and above, when they answered "Một", a lot of them always aspirated the T, like how you say the sound T in English IPA with a burst of air. Like "Một-tuh" 
 Which is weird because as also a Vietnamese, also living in the North, next to Hanoi only 10km, I personally have rarely ever heard any one pronounced words that way. If I say "Một", I don't aspirate the T, only stop it and hold the T behind my front teeth. It doesn't come out ever with a burst of air.
 The only person I could recall also talking like that is a coworker of mine whom I used to work with a long time ago. I forgot where he came from but just not a Hanoian and also came from the North, and he always pronounce T in words like that, aspirating with a burst of air. "Biết rồi", for example, it's like "Biết-tuh rồi"
 Is this common way of pronouncing words with T?
