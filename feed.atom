        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I have been trying to do my part in learning about Tet. I really love the culture. I was invited this year to go on a trip with my husbands family (who moved here along with my husband from vietnam only a few years ago), to participate in a more cultural lunar new year than their typical. They live in america, and since moving here they just stay home for the holiday. It seems that they are very excited to go on this trip, and i want to show my appreciation in any way possible. There is a strong language barrier between us, we mostly only communicate through my husband. I am wondering, what are some possible gifts i can bring them to show them my appreciation? I have done my research, but as an outsider i do not want to overstep and i feel a little insecure about giving them traditional gifts. I need to know if this is just me. For example, would it be overstepping if i wore a red dress? Or would it excite them that i want to participate like that? Would i be weird if i brought them lucky flowers? Any insight at all would be very appreciated :)

Recently I came to know about a documentary about it made by Ken Burns. I want to know if someone here watched it and what is your opinion on that documentary.
 Edit: I think it's somewhat stupid to say "Vietnam War". Sounds like the fault is yours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year will be the first Tet with my boyfriend, he's Vietnamese and I'm white. He used to celebrate pretty heavily with his immediate and extended family when he was younger, but the whole family has since stopped celebrating like they used to and I want to start up the celebrations again with him this year since I think it could be really nostalgic for him. I plan to decorate and cook, but what about gifts?
 I know that traditionally gifts of money are usually given to younger members of the family, so would it be weird if I got him a gift? I just really love gift giving and will look for any excuse to get him presents, but I don't want it to be weird if it seems inappropriate for this particular holiday. If it wouldn't be weird, what are some possible gift ideas that would be fitting? He really loves white tea, hates sweet things, and is always appreciative of plants if that helps.
 I remember him fondly reminiscing on the fun of red envelopes, and since it would be kind of awkward to give him money I had the idea of using the red envelopes to make a scavenger hunt for him. Thoughts on this idea? Too weird? Brutal honesty is appreciated, I'm still learning but it's hard to get an idea of what he would enjoy for Tet without spoiling the surprise of all my plans
 Thanks so much for any and all help!

This involves me lying face down in the water (using a snorkel and mask). Of course this will look odd to anyone who isn’t familiar with freediving and in the few instances I’ve had of actually trying this resulted in either getting shouted at by the lifeguard or they simply don’t allow anything that isn’t circuit or lane swimming. 
 How would I ask about whether I could do some freedive practice on the surface? My practice partner relies on me speaking Vietnamese for stuff but I don’t know how to say this.

She said of course, (I've tutored her daughters and we've visited together before). Afterwards they invited us in for drinks (it was just my husband and I and her, her husband and kids), and now she says they've had great luck this past year (good health, built a big new house, etc.) so she would like us to be officially invited for the evening this year lol. At the big new house they built. 
 Last time was just spur of the moment. I get a bit overwhelmed about the times during Tet when you do the specific things etc - I was just wondering if I should prepare a gift that would be "lucky"? She's always been helpful and friendly to us, but I'd like to show my appreciation in a culturally appropriate way. For example, I only recently learnt that you can't give certain flowers (the yellow chrysanthemum) as gifts, though luckily I've never done that. Would just like to know if there's a "special" gift that would be appreciated. Feel quite honored to be invited to be the first into her home in the new year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, going to be in Ho Chi Minh for ten days this January. I am a seasoned backpacker and really wanting great food and culture (for context I'm from Melbourne), I will also be travelling with my mum for a period who's VERY Korean but want some nice experiences. Struggling to find a travel blog or anything online I'm really resonating so hoping this community can give me some insights. 
 Food wise I would love street food, cool bars, places where locals eat and drink, areas where younger tourists go to socialise, where young locals go to socialise. 
 Is it worth doing a few days elsewhere? 
 Sorry, I know i'm asking a lot but any type of response will be gladly appreciated. Much love!

He seemed to be posting pretty frequently up until about 2 weeks ago when everything stopped. No updates from his Facebook page, and his YouTube account seems to have been deleted. I just want to make sure he's ok. Although he was doing a good thing, it's still a very risky venture in Vietnam. I'm curious what happened. Does anyone know anything?

 For context is, the relative open a chocolate shop in Saigon and it isn't doing well. She commented that Vietnamese doesn't like chocolate as much as coffee.
 Any insights to why choco is less favourable ?

We already have our stay booked in Hanoi, a cruise in Ha Long Bay and we have a list of places (mostly popular tourist attractions) which we would like to visit. I was hoping if you guys could give any tips and advises for our trip? Is there anything that we must see, any dishes we should try (I am aware of Egg Coffee, Pho and Bun Cha which we can get in Hanoi)? Is there anything that we should be cautious of (any scams etc.)?
 We are all very excited to come to Vietnam and explore it! Any advice will be much appreciated.

 I have an odd question. One of my neighbors is Vietnamese, and we live in the United States.
 I've been noticing at night a red light in their living room. They do not have curtains. It looks like 2 urns? And some other things that I can't make out. It looks like it's in a case of some sort. And there is 2 red lights on at all times, from what I can tell. 
 I was thinking it could be for a reptile, because I was going to offer them some of my old reptile keeping items, but my husband reminded me that they are Vietnamese and it could be a cultural thing. 
 I don't want to be rude by assuming, so is this something done in your culture? 
 Thank you all so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone know of a prepared meal service in Hanoi that delivers to your house with a pre-arranged menu? I'm looking for one that offers healthy options (western variety food if possible) with a budget of 100-200K each meal with 3 meals a day.
 I did some research and found some options for HCM such as SmartMeal which looks pretty decent but unfortunately they don't operate in HN, if anyone utilizes these services or has any suggestions I'd definitely appreciate it, cheers!

 I’m 25f, enjoys nature a lot, meeting people, and good food. I wanted to ask your personal recommendations on which spots I shouldn’t miss? From food, to nearby spots?
 The places I’m eyeing to visit are: - About 1-2 days in Hanoi - Hoi An - Ninh Binh - And Ha Long Bay.
 Questions:
  
Would it be good to spend 1 day in each town?
 What would be a good itinerary?
 Is Ha Long Bay worth it? Other towns you love?
 Food/ restos I shouldn’t miss in these places?
  
Thank you so much! ❤️

One is in duong dong town and the other one is in an thoi at the very southern tip of the island. Which one would be more convenient? We like to eat so does the west side have more restaurants than the south? We will be flying in but plan to do a boat tour to visit surrounding islands also.

I know its sensible to parboil your bones first to remove any impurities and get a clearer broth. However is it acceptable/correct to roast the bones first? This is pretty standard practice when making a broth in the west but I believe in doing things properly.

 I went out to the grocery store and some Vietnamese came to and told me he have some “pretty girls” and tried to show me some of their photos. I refused to him of course and went into the store but he took a picture of me and sent it to someone. It was very creepy! Has it happened to someone here? Why did he do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What social/cultural/political developments led to Vietnam becoming less authoritarian than China?
 Vietnam has access to Western sites while China blocks most. 
 China cares about policing the internet more than Vietnam, and China cares about policing cultural works than Vietnam. Yes, Vietnamese movies have some serious censorship but at least they can still make ghost movies and homosexual relationship content.
 Vietnamese leaders can more easily accept criticism from their citizens while Chinese leaders are less tolerant of criticism. Vietnam’s security minister was criticized for eating at a Salt Bae restaurant in London and had to resign. In China, many major scandals are heavily censored and covered up.
 What reasons make the Vietnamese government less authoritarian and more humane than the Chinese government?
 If it’s a case of losing authority? Why is the Vietnamese government more prone to make decisions that risk their authority than the Chinese government is?
 Is the higher humaneness of the Vietnamese government stemming from cultural reasons?
 Vietnam is still repressive and has one of the world’s worst press freedom scores, but the fact that they have access to all Western sites and more political accountability is a clear sign that it is much less authoritarian than China.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I just got engaged two months ago, I’ve been thinking about getting a customized ao dai for both my fiancé and I for our wedding. I’m located in the US and was wondering how much is a customized ao dai over in VT? My mom is currently visiting Da Nang and she went around looking for ao dais and couldn’t find anything to her/my liking, she told me that the colors and prints are for the spring season or for tet. I don’t mind waiting since I’m still planning my wedding, I don’t need it right away but just want to look and find the print and fabric that I like. She also told me the cost for two ao dais are roughly $500-$600 US dollars, does this cost sound right? I told my mom I don’t mind paying for that price but she kept telling me that it’s expensive. If anyone has any recommendations for places for a customized ao dais I would really appreciate it!

 What notes do cash machines give, say on a 1,000,000 withdrawal?
 Is there anyway to get smaller notes (20k, 50k, 100k)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, so I’m travelling to Vietnam next week and there are some things I’m worried about. 
 I’m currently on medication and I’m curious if I’m allowed to bring that into Vietnam? Do I need some kind of receipt or certification from my doctor to prove that the medicine belongs to me? I’m scared they’ll seize it at the airport.
 I’m also a very physically active person, and I plan on working out while I’m in Saigon. I’m taking creatine, and I have been pretty consistent with it so I don’t wanna stop now. I want to bring it to Vietnam but I’m a bit nervous. It’s a white powder. What if they think it’s cocaine and they confisticate it? But I’m guessing they have trained dogs for that?
 Maybe I’m taking this too seriously. I’m on vacation and I should enjoy it, and not think so much about the gym. What do you guys think?

 In particular, I recalled reading some teen mystery/detective book. I could have been written before the 90s. But I remember reading it in the late 90s to either 2000/2001. There is not much more to go on. Outside of the fact that I know it isn't Sherlock Holmes, Detective Conan, or TKKG (another series that I was searching for). Hope you guys can help. Thank in advance. I am sure there should only be a handful of series and or books about teenage detectives during this time.

I’ll be travelling Vietnam and it’s neighbouring countries on a motorcycle for a couple months and currently finalising some approximate financial figures. To those of you who have done something similar or “in the know”, how much should I budget for motorcycle maintenance/reparations? FYI, I’ll most likely be travelling on a Honda wave 110 or future 125, averaging approximately 150km/day for shy of 120 days.

The timeline seems a little rushed, and it would be nice to leave the weekend before. Unfortunately taking more time off afterwards isn't an option due to work deadlines, so it would have to be before. But since Tet is on Jan 22, would it be a waste of two days of PTO to leave on Jan 21 instead of Jan 25, since everything might be closed?

 Do you have any suggestion for local independent or underground culture, especially in HCMC and Hanoi?

 Although I won't miss some obvious touristic spot I would like to see and support some of the local scene. Never been in Vietnam so I don't know what to expect :)

 I'll be away until Monday evening but would love if there's a way to order one and have it shipped to the hotel on the weekend or Monday. The concierge at the hotel tried but was unsuccessful.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends! Next week I’m travelling to Vietnam with my mother and we’ll be staying there for three weeks. Last time I went to Vietnam was in 2015 so I’m pretty excited. 
 We’ll be spending the first week in Saigon, second week at my grandparents to celebrate Tet, and the third week in Phu Quoc Island. 
 There is one thing I’m worried about and that’s losing my phone. I’m worried about getting it stolen while in Saigon. It’s pretty crowded there so I’m a bit paranoid. 
 My phone is super important to me so I don’t wanna lose it. I’ll be wearing a fanny pack and I want to take a lot of photos and record videos while I’m there. 
 That’s also the problem. What if someone walks past me and snatches my phone while I’m recording? Or if someone on a motorcycle drives by and snatches it.
 When I was in Vietnam in 2015, I was just a child so I didn’t have a phone at the time so there was nothing to worry about. Anyone got some advice? What should I think about? 
 I’d also appreciate suggestions on nice restaurants and places to visit!

I won’t be doing any off road trails and plan on travelling the north and venturing into Laos and Cambodia after. 99% of the time I’ll be travelling without a passenger. I’m 185cm(6’0) & 75kg(165lbs); I’ll be carrying around 10kg of luggage. I’m leaning towards the future 125: It’s semi auto, lighter than the 150 and the parts are more widely available. Is the 125 sufficient or would you recommend the 150?

We are currently up to date with Hep A, Tetanus, Rabies and Typhoid, as well as the usual vaccines you get as a child in the UK (Mumps, Measles, Rubella, Polio, HPV) Is there anything else that anyone would recommend? We can't currently find anywhere that is offering Japanese Encephalitis vaccinations, so I'm also wondering if we will be safe to travel without this one? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is this a common thing in Vietnam? I admittedly haven't been travelling a whole lot since the pandemic so haven't been paying much attention to other places. But it seems a lot businesses have what look to be obviously fake 5 star reviews on google maps, far more so than other places (Mostly accounts that have only given 1 review ever). It's hard to gauge what businesses are reliable, as it seems so many businesses do it, even ones that are 'good' or have been around for a long time. I've also seen a few 1 start reviews that seem like smears, which may somewhat explain why businesses try to counter it
 Are there other websites people check to find how reliable a business is?

I'm looking for a travel buddy for activities such as hiking, walking, cultural exploration, volunteer, eco friendly tour... if you are planning to travel around Hanoi and througout Vietnam during this time and want more company, please let me know. I will be based in Hanoi and ideally looking for day trip, or out of town 2-4 days then ilback to Hanoi. 
 I was born and grew up in the Old Quarter of Hanoi but have been living oversea since 19yo. I still have many friends and family in Vietnam. I just visited Vietnam end of last year so have catched up on most family/friends and gatherings. I also realized my recreational interests have changed now (probably due to age and living in NZ) and more into activities such as town/market walk around, hiking, walking track, cultural experience...my friends in VN will just take me to a cool cafe or new restaurant everytime and i have started to feel I have enough of it. 
 So if you are like-minded, I would love to hear from you.

In Vietnam is there a way to get near the Chinese ‘borderline’ (not the actual passport control etc) but just so i can say that i’ve been to the border and maybe take a cool picture without being in a vehicle having to actually cross the border? Just thought it would be quite cool. This could be completely impossible but was just curious, thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi! my mom is from rural southern vietnam, and my dad is from hue. i grew up in the U.S. and am pretty detached from my roots. i never learned the language, and most of my vietnamese friends are the same way.
 my mom made a comment last week that made me wonder about the regional stereotypes in vietnam. she said that she originally never wanted to marry someone from hue because she thought they were stingy and cheap with money. i can also tell that there’s many differences in food preference, accent, personality, etc.
 what are some other differences and stereotypes between the regions in vietnam? is there a difference between rural and urban southerners as well? my parents often joke about my mom is a farm girl at heart, so i’d love to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. (throwaway account for privacy purposes). I'm seeking legal advice. My company just dropped this on us (foreign workers) on New Year. I suppose they're trying to cut budget (or encourage us to work more??). What's your take on this? Is this even legal according to the labour laws for foreigners in VN?
 Please note: I'm not naming and shaming, I just want to have a better understanding of this so I can weight my options (either to stay or leave).
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just returned home after 3-ish years in a god forsaken frozen corn field and noticed that there are now these yellow license plates everywhere. They're on buses, taxis, ubers/grabs, trucks, etc. I also noticed that some of the yellow plates also have "contract vehicle" (xe hợp đồng) stickered somewhere on the frame or windows.
 ​
 What do these yellow plates mean? Are they like company/corporate vehicles or something? The one commonality I can find is that they are all work/commercial vics of some sort (as opposed to private/personal transport).
 ​
 I could have sworn that there weren't these yellow plates back before I left. I'm almost certain that back then all the taxis, busses, and grabs still used the normal white plates. Did something change while I was away freezing my ass off?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone As the title suggests, I am loving my time in Vietnam, except for the bureaucratic headache of dealing with my lost luggage. 
 Simply put, on 26 December 2022, my luggage did not arrive, and I followed all the usual steps of filling out a lost luggage form, and notifying my original airline, JetStar. Of course, JetStar is blaming Vietnam airlines, who connected my flight from Saigon to Hanoi. I am now trying to submit a compensation claim with Vietnam Airlines, but all the resources point me to the general information and the form, which I have already filled out. My question is simply what email address do I contact/who do I send my claim to at Vietnam Airlines?
 I’m already past the 7 day notification period but given my deadlings with tracing and that I’ve been out of reception for much of my time here I’m hopeful I can shake them down. 
 Thanks so much.

However I have a really good job offer in Ben Tre and I would like to hear some opinions about living in Ben Tre as a foreigner who for now doesn’t speak Vietnamese (I want to learn but it will take some time tho)
 I’m aware it is a beautiful area of Vietnam but I wonder how foreigner-friendly is a not as big city as Saigon is and if the cost of living is higher/lower and some other aspects to take in consideration that you can think of.
 Any help is welcome! Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time ago I had dinner at a restaurant in NYC called Le Colonial. It was a high-end Viet-French Fusion kind of place. The dish I had was called Bo Sate. It was beyond good and I've not been able to forget about it. I want so badly to be able to make it at home.
 It was made with beef tenderloin (Bo), and had a sauce (Sate?) which included sweet potatoes and green string beans. My search for Bo Sate recipes only turns up Thai sate recipes, which is not the same.
 I really appreciate any hints or suggestions you can offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I’m looking to move somewhere else in Asia after having lived in Thailand for 4 years. I wonder how it’s like to live in Vietnam in terms of access to international food like imported beef and other groceries, can they be found in the supermarkets there? How long does the visa on arrival last? Are the prices on food and living generally low compared to in western countries? What about transportation, is it advisable to rent a motorbike? Are the hospitals and healthcare up to the same or similar standards as in Thailand? Are fitness centres well equipped with modern machines?
 Thanks!

Tonight I just received a message that this year it would be 15.4%, up from 12.9 from last year. I don't have the contract right now but I will check later to see if this is even legal. I remember there maybe some thing like maximum increment of 2% a year. The bank is TPB btw.
 Is this a normal thing? Is the rate too high for current market? Is there anything I should do?
 Update: thank you everyone, this looks like a market thing. I hope everyone is doing well financially. These rates really suck.

 Nguỵ đảng hoài gian, cánh dĩ mãi ngã quốc.
 Hân thương sinh ư ngược diệm,
 Hãm xích tử ư họa khanh.
 Khi thiên võng dân, quỷ kế cái thiên vạn trạng;
 I have a two questions about this. The first is about translations. I don't trust Google Translate and it's hard to track down a good translation online. Can anyone help?
 The second question might be harder. I want the foreigner to mispronounce one of the words so that it changes the meaning to something kind of funny. Are there any words in there that could change to something silly if they are spoken with the wrong tone? 
 I can always choose a different passage if this one doesn't work, but I want the content of the poem to be about war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are coming in March and will be visiting Hanoi, DaNang, & HCMC. I was going to bring two pairs of shoes: Vejas (walking shoes) for tourism activities and Tory Burch sandals (dress up for going out in the evening). Will this be enough or should I pack something different or additional? I am packing light and only bringing a carryon because of all of the travel.

 Any gamedev meetings?

As a foodie, I'm fascinated with all the food shops, restaurants, stalls in Hanoi. I noticed that most of the restaurants are generally 100% women-lead from cooking to servicing and to billing. Why? The rare exception I noticed so far are restaurants 100% ruled and managed by men, and these are thai-ish food related and generally by stylish men. Is there any sort of explanation? Thanks :)

 This is going to be our third time visiting Việt Nam. Until now, we mostly used air planes and trains. This time we would like to spend more time, so we would like to go in smaller steps to see more places. It seems the usual way to travel is by bus. How does the bus system work in general and after Covid? Is there one public transportation system or are there also privat companies. Would you also take taxies into account? When should we use which kind of transportation? Our route currently looks like the following:
 Sài Gòn -> Mỹ Tho -> Cần Thơ -> Sài Gòn -> Phan Thiết and Phan Rang <-> Đà Lạt <-> Buôn Ma Thuột -> Tuy Hòa -> Quy Nhơn -> Pleiku -> Kon Tum -> Hôi An and Đà Nẵng (<-> denotes that the order is not yet decided)
 Our plan is to take the train where applicable.
 Though, this is only the first half of our route as we would like to continue our route to Hà Nội in a similar style for another 30 days, but we have not looked into it too much yet. We hope this is a reasonable route to travel.

 We've already spent a few days in Hanoi and did Ha Long Bay, and while we love it we don't want to spend another 9 days there after Phu Quoc (leaving on the 13th). I've been looking at Ninh Binh / Tam Coc as an option for a 3 day stay, but all tours seem to leave from Hanoi to that area, and everything I'm reading says to do that area on a scooter but I don't have a bike license and my partner isn't comfortable driving one on her own.
 Is finding local tours easy in that area?. Any other suggestions for the north of Vietnam?. We're not the backpacking types, both middle aged and enjoy a certain amount of comfort :)
 Thanks!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I came down from central VN to Saigon for the weekend with my family. We stayed in an apartment at VinHomes Central Park, largely because it was convenient to get to the NYE fireworks on the river. Like, a ten minute walk. Along with a large crowd, we waited for the midnight fireworks to start. 
 And waited... and waited... and waited...
 At 12:20, we gave up and took the kids back to the apartment. When we got back, I turned on the TV and loaded the live stream of the Saigon fireworks. Nothing but streams of people leaving the riverside.
 When I got up this morning, I checked the local news, hoping to find an explanation. One news site, VN Express, had a glowing report of the festivities in HCMC along with photos of the "fireworks display":
 Vietnam rings in 2023
 This was the only reference I could find, so I've started the new year off with a mystery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been digging around wikipedia APIs for a few weeks (learning project, making a website with trending articles from regional wikipedias) and across 15 different languages a single anomaly stands out:
 Since January 2020, the Đài Tiếng nói Việt Nam article consistently blows out all daily viewership metrics:
  
February 2020 -- narrowly beats front page with 32k views.
 
March 2020 -- destroys it with 50k hits over 30k
 
August 2021 -- 3rd after front page and Taliban
 
April 2022 -- dwarfs everything else with 81k views. The next non-special article is about a dude named Tô Anh Dũng has measly 11k.
 
December 2022 -- still going strong with a 2nd place after front page
 
 I don't think it ever left top 3 for the past three years, no other article across the entire wikimedia comes even close.
 Is it tradition to read about Voice of Vietnam during breakfast, or did some popular site embed the article into their front page somehow? Any inside would be greatly appreciated 👐

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife (Canadian) and I (British) are going on our honeymoon to Vietnam, but intend to visit Thailand for a few days midway, before returning to Vietnam for the last portion before flying home. 
 The official guidance for British citizens is that 15 days single entry is allowed without a visa, then you have to wait 30 days till you try to enter again. I've seen claims that the "30 days untill you re-enter" rule isn't really enforced and that you can just re-enter again on the 15 day rule, but I'm not sure I want to test that theory based on unsubstantiated claims...
 So my plan currently is to use the 15 days for the first entry, then apply for an E-Visa as soon as I get to Vietnam, print it somewhere, and use it when I re-enter Vietnam the second time from Thailand. 
 Do any British people have experience leaving and returning to Vietnam as a tourist in one trip? What did you do?

 https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/VNM/vietnam/gdp-gross-domestic-product
 which suggests GDP per capita has increased 1000% since 1999. So just out of interest, has life got much better for you and/or your family over that time?
 I'm not biased, just interested in hearing inspiring or cynical stories, either is good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I come from a developing country that can be compared to Vietnam in many ways. But the main difference is the apparent tolerance of the state/authorities to informal businesses, eg street food. Are informal small business tolerated or encouraged ? Is there any form of corruption involved? How does the state collect taxes ? What is the size of the grey economy? How important is a business registration? 
 
Most restaurants, even small and apparently informal ones, have a PoS management software, and many print a receipt. I often see small business managers using calculators and apparently doing their accounting. Similar restaurants/business in my country usually don't even have a logbook (combination of illiteracy and bad management). I know that Vietnam mostly got rid of illiteracy decades ago, but I feel that there's more to this than just knowing how to read and write.
 
I mostly think of the vietnamese as one of the most industrious people on the planet. But on rare occasions, i meet people that seem even lazier than my countrymen, usually the younger ones. Especially in cafés, waiters seem incredibly slow and unprofessional. What's happening here ? What am I missing?
 
 Sorry if my questions are ingenuous. I just want to better understand the vietnamese society.

 I like the two word names with Anh being the second one if possible (a family thing) , but not necessary. Any other suggestions?

Can you get one without the other? I was born in VN and have my birth certificate but did not have a passport as I entered USA under my parents passport (5 years old).
 What do I need to do to get dual citizenship. Keep in mind that I would not be able to obtain any documents pertaining my parents as they do not want me to get dual citizenship. I have family in VN also.

 We've been close friends for nearly five years. They've taught me a lot about antisemitism (they're half jewish) and about Vietnamese culture.
 Recently, we've been getting into some arguments about their behavior and general attitude toward our friendship. I try to be as openminded and a good listening ear but I'm not sure how to pick out what is and isn't "okay" for them to say. (For clarity, I'm autistic and I cannot for the life of me discern some things as excuses and others as real reasons. I err on the side of caution and take everything as a reason but recently I've had a gut feeling about that being the wrong approach.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I will be visiting Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam this upcoming Fall and was wondering if there are any local fashion brands that I should check out? I heard that it is not worth shopping for global brands so I am more interested in shopping locally. 
 The style I am looking for is casual loungewear/active wear, but looking for thick/plush materials that would not pill, fade, and is soft. I typically avoid any loud patterns or colors and enjoy more neutrals. Brands that I think of as an example of the style I am going for is PANGAIA, Gymshark, Alphalete, etc.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just now, roughly 5-10 minutes before this post was created, I heard my neighbor doing what sounds like physically abusing and beating a dog. From what I can hear him yell, he broken something of the dog and did something to the dogs teeth, possibly causing it to severely bleed. The dog was wimping and crying very loudly as I can hear my neighbor with his wife and children messing up the dog. I live basically next door with the window right above his house. I need to know if there is any practical way of reporting him for "Animal Abuse". There has to be some way to make him stop as I very much cannot stand the situation.
 Due to obstruction, the videos I have do not contain any images, but the auditory evidence is very clear.
 I live in Phu Quoc, if that affects anything.
 Please give advices, I am only a highschooler and most other members in my family seems like they won't do much.

Not so much the stuff you’ll find in tourist shops but stickers, keychains, postcards and prints that are made by the youth and subcultures of Hanoi. Skater culture and coffee culture shops here usually sell that kind of merch. Even “cute” style designs I don’t mind. Just want to support young artists. I’m staying near the French Quarter and the lake. Thank you in advance.

 I'm curious for my job search what jobs and positions/roles other expats have and how you got it. Not to mention is it with a local company or international company? I'm looking to see how others went about getting their lives started in Vietnam
 If you have any stories on the timeframe it took for you, how long you've been there and what times you applied that were peak performance hours for applications for jobs I'd love to hear your stories! Thanks friends and stay safe!

In two months time I’ll be travelling to Vietnam, where I plan on purchasing a motorcycle to travel south east Asia on. I’ve narrowed down my search to two models, Honda Wave & Winner. I’ll be landing in Hanoi, where I’ll stay for a couple days sorting out the motorbike and logistics. Although I’m keen on buying one of these two models, I’ll buy whatever’s available to me once I’m there. My question is as follows: are there any well known websites, forums, social media groups, companies etc where travellers and organisations sell their/these motorbikes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently an American ESL teacher based in Saigon took to social platforms to expose the truth about the rampant sexual harrasment in a Vietnamese High School (Nguyen Thi Dieu).
 1/Upon seeing a female highschooler being forced to remove her jacket and inappropriately touched by a security guard at school, Teacher Kenny apparently stood up for her by using physical force against the guard. Kenny was furious and was asking for an investigation as this has happened numerous times before with other students. 
 2/There is CCTV footage documenting the guard being inapproprate with students in his office : forcing them to undress to check their nametag, inappropriate touching and groping female students. The school board forced everyone to stay silent and threatened to destroy Kenny's teaching career in Saigon if he went on to draw attention to the case. The guard, on the other hand, only got off with a warning. 
 3/Teacher Kenny has since spoken up about the incident on many social sites such as Tiktok and Facebook, students who are former victims of harrassment by the guard are also speaking up and trying to gain traction for the case.
 4/The Vietnamese English teacher, however, is bribing students with exam points if they stay silent or inform her about the ones who side with Kenny on social media. She called students "stupid" for siding with a "white westerner", threatened various UNDERAGE students for making tiktoks defending the victims and teachers. An adult woman who is an educator is going around spreading racism and threatening minors.
 Here's a link to Kenny's tiktok : https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS86jpE2w/

 I will be flying from California to Việt Nam in January for Tet and plan to bring many electronic gifts (like 5 laptops, 5 iPhones, 5 Apple Watches). I imagine the wise thing to do is just place all of them in a check-in container and pick up at the destination. I was wondering if there would be a problem if i placed a single laptop, watch and iPhone in my carry-on. 
 Thank you in advance for any advice.

 I have no idea what her experience was or how she feels about everything. So, I will be just as interested to read the story as many of you. I answered all questions they had. I showed them several things that they were very curious about:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I will be traveling to VietNam early next year. I have a severe seafood (more so finned fish, but contamination is a concern) and brazil nut allergy and I was hoping to get some insight into how I would communicate that in Vietnamese if I need to.
 I looked it up through Google Translate, but I find that it is often not very accurate. If anyone has any advice on pronunciation that would be helpful too, as I find that more difficult as a native English speaker.
 I'm not sure how to phrase it best either, so if anyone has advice regarding that it would be great. I am thinking it would be best to keep it simple, just something like "No seafood/brazil nuts, I die" or "I will die".
 So far something I have thought of trying is to print out an allergy card with the information on it, but I think it may be good to get other suggestions as well. 
 Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I was wondering if anyone has tried the fried chicken at Lotteria in Vietnam and what your thoughts were on it. Personally, I've tried all the big international chains like KFC, Popeyes, and Jollibee, and I have to say that none of them hold a candle to the deliciousness of Lotteria's fried chicken.
 The chicken at Lotteria is always fresh and tender, and the marinade they use is just the right balance of herbs and spices. Plus, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. In comparison, the chicken at the other fast food chains I've tried has been either dry or cold, or both. It's just not the same level of quality as what you'll find at Lotteria.
 Now, I will admit that the rest of the menu at Lotteria leaves something to be desired. The sides are pretty mediocre and the sandwiches and burgers are just okay. And the desserts? Well, let's just say they're not exactly worth writing home about. But despite all that, the chicken at Lotteria is still worth the visit (or delivery) in my opinion.
 So I'm curious to hear what others think - have you tried the fried chicken at Lotteria? What were your thoughts? Is it worth the visit (or delivery)? And if anyone knows of a better fried chicken place in Vietnam, I'd love to hear about it!

 We (my wife and I) are currently in Vietnam, enjoying the country thorougly and planning our next steps. In a few days, we’ll head to the middle of Vietnam, and after that likely to the South. 
 However, it seems the weather won’t be that good for the middle & the south, especially in the region of Da Nang and Nha Trang.
 Also, Phu Quoc seems to get pretty rainy, which was basically our ‘end of holiday’ getaway. 
 Do we need to consider going abroad (say Thailand, Phuket - looking more stable over the course of 2 weeks), or are weather forecasts in Vietnam generally wrong? Would love to hear from you!

 However, much to my annoyance, my generation (those born outside of Vietnam) are purposely being kept out of the loop. It doesn't help that I don't speak the language and that my family just blatantly discussess all of this right in front of me, knowing that I can't follow the conversation. The only tidbits of info I get are from eavesdropping on my mother when she is trying to explain the mess to my father.
 When I communicated my chagrin concerning me being kept clueless, my mom explained to me that in Vietnam fights are being kept isolated within the generation and that none of this will affect me, because I am from the next generation.
 Is this a thing in Vietnam or am i being told a bunch of nonsense? Personally, I would prefer to remain on friendly terms with my family in Vietnam.

 A friend and I want to go out of Romania, where we live, on a 3 weeks long trip, and Vietnam will probably be our destination.
 My simple plan is to fly to Hanoi and rent an apartment in the city center. After that, we could split our time between discovering Hanoi at a very relaxed pace and going on daytrips such as these: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293924-Activities-c63-Hanoi.html
 We are open to splitting our times between multiple places in Vietnam, or maybe cutting our time here short and spending a week in Kuala Lumpur or Tokyo, but it seems like a hassle.
 What would you do?

 I have about 1.5 weeks left in Vietnam until I have to go back home. I'm looking for some recommendations on where I should visit this time of the year, or just in general! I'm currently staying with family in HCM, so anywhere drivable is fine but I also don't mind flying somewhere a bit further. So far I have been to: HCM, Sapa, Can Tho, Ha Long, and Ha Noi
 In the past I have also been to Nha Trang and Dalat. 
 I am considering Hoi An. Also would love recommendations for good night markets in the HCM area, or areas with great street food in general! Thanks in advance.

 I will be traveling with my wife and 3 kids (18,16,13) for 2 weeks in March. First time for my wife to come back to Vietnam after she left when she was 6 months old in 1972.
 I am hoping to find a driver for the whole 2 weeks who is willing to travel with us. It would be ideal if they spoke English but that may be a lot to ask? Any thoughts on the best way to find someone?
 Also, because there are 5 of us, AirBnb can sometimes be a good solution. Any reason not to try this route (for example, first 3 nights in Saigon we could get an apartment in District 1). Cost isn't a big issue as I want to make this a memorable trip for everyone. 
 thanks in advance for any and all thoughts.

I was hoping to make some friends whilst we are living in Vietnam so thought I'd post in here. We are 30 and 28 years old and we both love music, going to the gym and bouldering. I love gaming and can also play the bass guitar (would love to start a band actually!). We also both love food and going for a few drinks now and then. 
 Please message me if any of our interests align and you would also love to make some new friends! Would be nice to know we aren't alone in the amazing country that is Vietnam!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in a smallish town in the South, I am a foreigner and my wife is Vietnamese. I'm pretty embedded in my family and local community and I know that people prefer to handle things "in house" or without the police a lot, but I'm just at a loss.
 The house directly behind ours (their back wall forms the wall of our yard) has a woman who is an absolutely insane and abusive nutcase to her very small child, or maybe children I'm not sure. She screams like a lunatic and hits the poor child, which makes it wail this horrific wail I can't take anymore. It's honestly shameful I haven't done anything yet but I just haven't known what to do and everyone here has a very "mind your own business" attitude so I don't know who to turn to.
 Last week I was afraid that I was listening to her actually killing her child. There was a pained screaming that only comes from death, and then it suddenly cut off to total silence. I remember though that lately I'd heard a puppy, I think she killed the puppy in front of the child. I heard the child sobbing.
 Who do I contact, what branch of government handles investigations like this? Besides the absolutely over the top regular abuse, I feel like if she really did kill that puppy in front of the kid(s) she may one day kill them too. I don't know, I think maybe she has some really intense post-partum psychosis. Due to the layout of the neighborhood I've never actually seen any of them and I don't know what the front of their house looks like.
 I'm very worried and I am at the point that I can't let my moral cowardice get in the way any longer, something needs to be done.
 Can any Vietnamese people here help me? My wife doesn't hear it because she's rarely in the back yard and while she's normally a very lovely person, I don't think she's taking it seriously and may be worried about social blowback.
 Thank you.

 My question is…. Is it possible to get “used” to the heat biologically ? I don’t want tips on how to stay cool… I just want to know if it is possible for my body to get used to the heat if I stay for a certain amount of time. I tend to sweat easily and it seems like stepping outside of my hotel would trigger the sweats. Any advice here? On my trip I just ended up going to Da Lat and other cooler parts of VN.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time visiting Vietnam in March and we will be doing 10 days in the north and trying get some ideas for how we can plan the trip. We want to fit in Ha Giang/Sapa, Ninh Binh, Halong Bay, and Hanoi in but the issue is 10 days is a little tight.
 What do you guys think about the 4 day/3 night option vs 3 day/2 nights for Ha Giang Loop? Is it too rushed to do the 3 day option on QT's website? It allows us to fit Ninh Binh and Halong Bay in a bit easier but I'm a little worried that it'll be too rushed to enjoy the loop.
 The other option is to do Sapa instead of the Ha Giang loop which will definitely make the itinerary easier since I think you can definitely fit Sapa in 3 day/2 nights in very easily.
 Thoughts? Are there any other places you think I should consider and bump one of the options I listed out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This time, an American tourist was caught trying to meet a minor on Christmas Day. Unfortunately, this was also his last day in Vietnam. More than likely nothing will happen to him as he has already gotten on his flight back to America, but the good news is we will be submitting the evidence to his local authorities in New York where he lives. 4 catches in 4 weeks. 
 Be sure to check your children's phones to see who they may be chatting to. I will post the video tonight at 8pm (local time in Vietnam). 
 Just like the other catches, this guy stays and tries to talk his way out of the crime he committed. It is illegal to lure a minor. It is illegal in Vietnam, the United States, and nearly every country around the world.

 My wife and I are currently enjoying a cruise in Ha Long Bay, and contemplating about our journey’s next step in Vietnam. 
 We are definitely into trekking, and the idea is to travel to Sapa, either for a 2 or 3 day trip, to check the beautiful rice fields.
 However, the weather forecast says it will rain unfortunately, and I am not entirely sure if december is a good time to visit, since it may be quite cold.
 Would you guys recommend a visit to Sapa the 27th till the 29th of December?
 Would be great hearing from you. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are staying in Hồ Tràm for holidays, in a big tourist resort. On a Christmas eve Turkey dinner, there was a big group of people, who were (almost)all wearing white fancy clothes: most of them young and adult ladies but some men, children and at least one old lady. They were almost all wearing white fancy clothes: dresses, lacy shirts etc. Except the old woman was wearing something red & some men had jeans or black trousers. They were also playing some games or giving speeches or something.
 In my culture white fancy clothes are usually something a bridal party wears, or on some other special occasion if everyone is wearing them in unison. I was wondering if this is a cultural thing for a special occasion, as they all looked more Asian than Caucasian, and asked our waiter, what was the occasion end gestured in their general direction (I think I did it discreetly) and our waiter was immediately super apologetic and kept repeating "I'm so sorry" and we were super confused, saying "no need to apologize, it's fine" etc. and we never got an answer, what was the occasion, and we were left in confusion.
 My SO was giving me shit afterwards for asking it. I never intended it to be anything hurtful or insulting, as they were in high spirits and I think it is okay in many cultures to ask simply "what's the occasion" when you see a group or family celebrating. 
 So if someone could guess what was the occasion and also tell me if I was an insensitive white biach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may be surprised to know Vietnam has a wonderful cosplay community. There are several groups that organize events year round (usually 1-2 events every month). Currently, there is a Winter Convention Manga Festival going on; it was today and it will also be going on tomorrow too! 
 If you are into anime, manga, comics, and cosplay, then you should absolutely check these events out. I have been going to every event for the last 5 months or so. I film short videos (3-5 minutes) showing the cosplayers. I let them do a pose/action for about 5 seconds and show as many as I can. 
 You can find the cosplay festival videos by searching YouTube: Saigon Sterling. I have a "Cosplay!" playlist from all the events. If you see me there, I am always happy to include you in my videos if you want to be in one. I do it to showcase the cosplay community and let others know about this community in Vietnam. All the people who go are very kind and friendly. Those of us that dress up always allow people to take photos and videos. 
 Entry fees for most of the events is around 120,000 VND. Hope to see more new cosplayers in the near future. If you have any questions, just let me know!

My husband and I have traveled to Vietnam many times together, visited many different regions/cities, we are very comfortable and love it there. Traveling as a young couple in our 20’s was fun and easy. This time we are taking our daughter and I’m suddenly so nervous 😫 Any tips/advice/words of encouragement would be much appreciated!
  
There is no law or regulations on car seat. We were thinking to rent a car and bring our own travel carseat from the US. Has anyone done this? Is transportation going to be a pain?? 
 
Is “high chair” even a thing?? We love street food and always sat on the little plastic stools…our 18mo will for sure just jump off and run lol. How do you handle a toddler when eating out?
 
Can anyone recommend some nice parks or playground in HCMC and Da Lat we can take a toddler to? (Please no Thao Cam Vien or Dam Sen…does that place still exist? Lol no idea) 
 
 Anything else relating to safety, health, food, sleep/Jet lag, that you have experienced please share ❤️ xin cảm ơn 💛

 I am probably describing it badly, but it's basically a long sleeve jacket that goes all the way down to the feet with a hood and possibly even gloves? Head to toe. Like a scooter burka, but waterproof? 
 Any idea where we can buy one? Maybe one of the local chos?

 Anyone was there and can share their experience? (including Body dimensions would be best).

 Thinking of pulling up to some club right after I land in HN on 12/30, then spend the next week or so exploring the night life.
 I’m mostly interested in dancing so places like 1900 is out. Currently The Warehouse and Birdcage are on my list. Anywhere else I should look at? Preferably queer friendly and more underground.
 Incredibly down to meet up with anyone who’s going as well. Have my cousins here but I don’t think they like techno lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since I was in middle school, I self taught English, and before I knew it I started thinking in English in my mind. Nowadays, I have started to notice that I struggle a lot when I interact with people in Vietnamese, I always try to find the equivalents of the words im thinking and end up stuttering or saying something that I thought would convey what Im trying to say but dont? I only feel comfortable to truly express myself in English and sometimes, by reflex, I just think out loud or mumble to myself in English and probably make others think theres something wrong with me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My brother-in-law is getting out of Cho Ray hospital and taking a 20-hour flight back to the United States. Since he is still very weak, his family would like to find someone to accompany him and help get him in and out of wheelchairs and through a connecting flight in Tokyo. We will pay for your ONE-WAY ticket ($750 more or less), economy class, from Ho Chi Minh to Chicago. You must be able to enter the US without a visa (i.e., American citizen or greencard holder), since we don't have time to procure a visa. The flight leaves Ho Chi Minh City on Saturday Dec 24 at 11:45pm. 
 If anyone has basic medical or nursing experience, that would be ideal, but we're not expecting it.
 If you're interested, please direct message me and I'll respond with a Zoom link to give you a rundown on his condition and what to expect. I am in San Francisco and there is a 15-hour time difference so I won't be able to check messages until 8 hours from now during my morning time.
 My brother-in-law is a pleasant 50-year old and his illness relates to his internal organs (he's not contagious).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been traveling Vietnam for two weeks and had a wonderful time. The country is beautiful, the food and culture are amazing, and I’ve found the people to be the best part of all - extremely gracious, respectful, and hospitable.
 But then I came to Hanoi. And I’m baffled. We had a bus driver sneezing and coughing up phlegm, spitting it into a cup, for the entirety of a three hour bus ride, there and back, without a mask. This morning, we were in a lovely coffee shop. But the girl sitting across from us, working on her laptop, was sneezing uncontrollably and coughing terribly. She was clearly not just under the weather, but very sick. Again, she was not wearing a mask. I made eye contact with a perplexed look on my face and she looked back as though I was the one in the wrong. 
 And then a cab just now. The driver coughing every 10 seconds for a 20 minute ride. No mask. 
 I know people here wear masks. More than half of the people on motorbikes have them on. What are they for? Do people in Hanoi use them just for pollution? When we were in other cities (Saigon, Hoi An, Ninh Binh, Mai Chau) I saw plenty of people wearing masks inside, and none of the kind of blantant illness that is in Hanoi.
 I’m terribly sorry if this comes off as culturally insensitive. I promise I don’t intend it to be. But coming from the West and other parts of Vietnam, and particularly in a post-Covid world, I’m really perplexed - what is going on in Hanoi?

 Would local people be more offended if I try to speak to them in English, or use my very beginner level Vietnamese? I've heard that if you try to use Vietnamese, people seem very happy that you are making an effort and will be nice to you, but I've also read posts about people who addressed somebody using the wrong pronoun and got scolded in Vietnamese by that person.

 If anyone in this situation has managed to sort out their papers, can you please DM me or share your experience in the comments? Thank you. 
 There are many posts like this on this sub, but mostly for people who have 2 vietnamese parents, or who were born in vietnam. these are different cases and do not apply to my case!

Can anyone confirm? I am in the US so I can't provide cash. I asked a friend to extract the wire transfer information from the bill (see attached image) but it seems to be missing some info and I know wire transfers can go bad if you get the slightest detail wrong. There's a QR code, but it wouldn't scan for me. At the very bottom of the bill it mentions "Payoo" which appears to be a payment app. Would anybody be so kind as to look at this bill and decipher for me how to pay it? I have Venmo and PayPal. I know this isn't HIPPA compliant, but that's the least of our worries.

 I recently found out about the other side of my culture and, I have been learning Vietnamese. And, I have been getting the hang of it. The only problem I feel like I'm not doing it right and my English accent comes through. Would I be able to give myself a Vietnamese name so it's easier to say while talking the Vietnamese language or would be offensive? I'm really sorry if it is. I don't really know how to handle things since I wasn't raised in an Asian household I have a lot of mixes in my family but I don't know my Vietnamese family sadly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, 
 We are expat family (kid) from Europe, living in Saigon since half a year. I really see living in Vietnam as a lifetime experience for the whole family but I must admit we are getting tired with Saigon, in particular:
 - air pollution
 - noise
 Things we do like here:
 - green area in D7
 - great English run preschool
 - good eating and services availability 
 As I can work remotely, coming to office not very frequently, moving somewhere else is an option. I need to fly to SEA countries occasionally, trips to China and Japan can happen too. English preschool is important as our kid is just learning English :)
 Danang looks good for those reasons:
 - no air pollution
 - access to beach, proximity to other nature attractions
 - less busy, less traffic
 We have been only once, actually going to Hoi An. I would plan going there for a month or so, closed to end of lease of our apartment in HCMC.
 ​
 To the point. I am curious of opinions/experiences of other people that have done this move, or have been considering it and dropped the idea (why). Anybody here? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Without revealing too much personal info, I have Vietnamese speaking family who are hitting their very young puppy whenever it misbehaves.
 It is a puppy, it needs positive reinforcement and calm correction if it is going to learn. Hitting it when it pees inside or nips at people only scares it and makes it hide bad behavior. They hit it so hard and it makes me so sad.
 I tried to use google translate but all I can find is “how to train your dog” pages, not “this is why you don’t hit dogs” pages. 
 Please help. If there is a better subreddit to post this, please let me know and I will delete this post and put it there instead. Also, I do understand that there is a sensitive history when it comes to dogs in Vietnam, but if you’re going to keep a dog as a pet you should properly treat it as one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I have a question about the exchange rate from USD to VND I have been curious about and hope you all can answer for me. 
 I know the USD rate to VND is about 1.00 USD to 23,000 VND. 
 What does VND start with? for example, when I send money to family in VN. If I send $100 USD and it converts to about 2,300,000. 
 For Vietnamese people does this translate to about 2,300 dollars? 
 That's like here in the US, someone depositing $2,300 into my bank and having enough to buy a older used car. I would think it is equivalent to $230 dollars for you and something that can hold you off for a short amount of time spending-wise, otherwise shouldn't 2,300 lasts a much long time? 
 It seems as though the family in Vietnam spends the money pretty quickly or need to ask for asistance often. So another question would be: Is the cost of living in VN pretty high for locals? I know for us Viet Kieu it's very livable and considered cheap but im hearing a family member said his daughter ate a bowl of Pho for 50,000 and one time 90,000VND. If Vietnam money starts at 1,000 and that is like $1 dollar here in US, that's like me going out to buy a bowl of Pho for $50 - 100 usd which is unheard of. 
 So I've been looking for answers on google about this but have not found a clear answer so I am hoping you all can shed some light on this. 
 thanks!

I've done teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, and the experience I had with them was very different from how VUS is doing things so far with me. To be honest, it comes off as sketchy at times and makes me suspicious.
 I'll be honest, I'm actually quite confused at points. I was offered a job, but when asked to see an actual written contract with terms, conditions, duties, etc., I was told that I would only see a contract after I've landed in Vietnam. Agreeing to take a job on the other side of the world without having seen and signed an actual contract beforehand strikes me as super sketchy. When I took teaching jobs in Japan and South Korea, they provided me with full-on, multi-page contracts to read and review before agreeing to fly halfway around the world.
 I also know that I'll be flown in on a business visa and do a probation period first for a month or two before acquiring a work permit and then a resident permit from there. Once again, this also confuses me. I've never had to do a probation period before when agreeing to do a job overseas, and the whole "applying for a 3-month business visa, then a work permit" thing instead of "applying for a work visa from the get-go" thing also confuses me.
 Lastly, aside from all that, how has your experience been with VUS? How was the teaching and prep workload? How were employer-employee relations overall? Was the pay sufficient to save (aiming for $500 a month if I can) and could hours be picked up easily? If on a part-time contract, was it easy to take vacation days (even if unpaid)? 
 Any and all input is welcome. Thank you very much in advance!

It even lists late trips, leaving the airport after 11PM. I would like to know if anyone has taken it recently or knows about it. I'm trying to find out where the stop is a Domestic terminal, if it really does run until 11PM, if it is uncomfortable with luggage (no chair, etc) or anything else. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I need some travel related advice from a person familiar with these cities in Vietnam : Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue City. 
 I am from India and currently in Vietnam with my parents. I have been here for 6 days and visited Hanoi, Sa Pa, HaLong Bay and HCMC, and now moving on to Hue city by an early morning flight on 21st December, and my return flight back to India is in evening of 24th December from Da Nang. 
 The issue, now, is that the weather forecast shows it will more or less rain for next 3 days (21-24 December) continuously. I was currently planning to visit the Historic city of Hoi An, then Ba Na Hills through Ropeway and then Citadel in Hue city and then go back to Da Nang and take the return flight. 
 Can someone please help me figure out how many days I should spend in each city and what I should avoid doing to make the best of whatever time I have in these 3 cities. Or. Maybe I can go to a nearby city that has no rain and travel there? Open to suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s not the first post about this, and unfortunately it probably won’t be the last either :( 
 My husband and I arrived at HCMC airport a couple hours ago - we’ve been in Thailand for the past couple weeks on holiday, and thought we’d pop over to Vietnam for a few days too. 
 When we came out the airport, one of the guys in a white shirt got us. All the advice we read beforehand was about metered taxis, and the guy said that the taxi is metered so we didn’t think anything more of it so it should be fine. Hopped in and asked to be dropped to our hotel in District 1. 
 No joke… the meter was going up 25k every 10 seconds. After less than 10 mins of driving, we told him it’s far too expensive and we need to get out. Paid 600k to be left on the side of the road :( wish we’d stuck to our guns and given him less, he made a stupid amount off our naïveté. 
 We ordered a Grab which dropped us the rest of the way for just 80k. In hindsight that’s what we should’ve done when we were looking for a taxi, but hindsight is always 20/20!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all been on this forum for a while. I am strongly considering moving to Vietnam. I’d love to have a scientific job there such as medical research, but I’ve done quite a bit of looking into this and can’t seem to find many opportunities, so I would probably go into teaching english.
 I lived in Saigon for about 6 months in 2020 with my now ex-gf, and I really loved it, and ever since have been a little obsessed with watching videos about it, keeping up with news/info there. My friends and family know I love it as I do speak about it with them sometimes.
 The problem is, while I was living there, I wasn’t actually working, so it was more of an extended holiday, and I know actually working there would be much different. I have a TEFL certificate and also a bachelors degree, and actually had an interview a while ago when I was considering moving there a year ago, and was offered a teaching job, but in the end I declined it.
 Only things that are stopping me are leaving my great friends and family here, learning to ride a bike there is a bit daunting (never driven one before), and maybe regretting my decision after taking the leap. 
 I am considering taking another holiday there for around a month and just kind of acting like I l live and work there, just to test it out, but not sure how useful that actually is.
 Anyway, if you have any thoughts on this let me know! And if you know of any medical science jobs there that a British person with a science degree could get into, please tell me (although I may make a separate post about this)!

 I'm planning a two week motorbike road trip in Vietnam and I'm trying to decide where to go. I'm considering either starting in Ho Chi Minh City and making my way up to Hanoi, or just focusing on the northern part of the country. I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations on which option would be the best for a road trip.
 I'm interested in seeing as much of the country as possible, but I'm also open to just staying in one region if it has particularly beautiful or interesting sights to see. I'm particularly interested in seeing more of the traditional Vietnamese culture and nature. 
 Is the southern part of Vietnam also worth visiting, or is Ho Chi Minh City the main highlight in that region?
 Any thoughts or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several days ago, I have read two articles that are critical about Vinfast.
 VinFast VF8 Is Simply Not Ready for America (jalopnik.com) 
 180 Miles for $55k: Can the 2023 VinFast VF 8 SUV Break Into America? (motortrend.com) 
 From what I have found out, the Vinfast VF 8 would cost at least $55k (Eco starts at $59k according to their site), and that the City Edition would only have 180 miles of range, which is a joke considering that most EVs have between 200-350 miles of range. The fact that the Vinfast name is weak compared to other brands like Tesla, Polestar, Rivian, Lucid, Hyundai, Kia, Ford, GM, Mercedes Benz, BMW, VW/Audi/Porsche, etc. won't do it any favours either.
 In the US, with other EVs that are more competitive like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Hyundai Kona EV, Kia EV6, Kia Niro EV, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Polestar 2, BMW i4, Mercedes Benz EQB, Audi Q4 E-tron, VW ID.4, Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and the Tesla Model 3 (even its starting price now at $47k puts it at a better position than the VF 8, and that is after massive price hikes as the April 2021 price of the Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive sits below $40k), would Vinfast succeed or would they end up failing like Yugo (at least Yugos are cheap)?
 Also, how was the experience of Vinfast cars and EVs in Vietnam? Were they good or were they bad?

 I was just killing some time being stuck in a Wikipedia/Wiktionary rabbit hole. By chance I found a few Vietnamese slangs/neologisms borrowed from Chinese, such as cao phú soái (高富帥) and cẩu huyết (狗血). 
 How commonly used are these phrases? Are there any controversies about borrowing phrases from Chinese?
 Are these phrases borrowed via TV shows from mainland China / Taiwan? How popular is Chinese-language entertainment in Vietnam?
 Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both my parents were born in Vietnam and are Vietnamese citizens (AFAIK). I want to be able to become a Vietnamese citizen and get a dual citizenship (US/Viet). My parents moved to the US in the 90s and have become US citizens in the mid 2010s. Some sources say you can get dual citizenship and some others say you must renounce foreign nationality. I'm very confused on which one is the most accurate and up to date fact. I am not willing to lose US citizenship over this.
 ​
 I do not want to go down the route of getting a business or work visa or doing the visa renewal trips every month or 3 months. I have a gf in Vietnam that I may end up marrying but in my opinion, that is not the safest route for myself because I don't want to be deported if we ever seperate. I want to be independent and not have to rely on others for me to legally stay in vietnam. 
 I do have some family members in Sagion/Bao Loc but I am not very close to them. I can also speak basic vietnamese, as in I can navigate daily life but when it comes to reading gov't documents and speaking on important matters I am not at that level yet. Basically at a 5th grade level.
 ​
 What are my options? I found this line in a website that gives me hope that I can apply for it easily or without too much restrictions or requirements. 
 ​
 "BY DESCENT: Child, both of whose parents are citizens of Vietnam, regardless of the child's country of birth. Child, one of whose parents is a citizen of Vietnam and the other is stateless, regardless of the child's country of birth. "

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in a small town and every other Sunday they cut our power from 7AM to 5PM (but it's almost guaranteed to be a few hours after). Today they didn't turn the power back until 9PM. I am looking for a solution for power during those cuts. Many of my neighbors have generators. It's a bit noisy and honestly I don't like storing fuel in my house.
 I tried looking up for batteries. I am not installing solar panels, just batteries that are charged by electricity when available. "Pin tích điện" is the Vietnamese keyword I can use without being pointed to "ắc quy" or "pin sạc" (which won't have enough wattage). Can you please recommend a good source? What is the general price for my requirements below? In the long run is it cheaper than a generator? Is there a reason most people just use generators that I am not aware of?
 We won't be cooking but an aircon is required for at least 3-4 hours for our toddler (also one reason I prefer battery over generator is due to the noise). I would like to run a fan, watch TV or use my laptop if possible. There is a fridge, would be nice if I can keep it running but we always keep it cold the day before anyway so maybe running it for an hour only mid-day won't hurt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read a lot about people who've jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge (one of the world's most frequent suicide locations) and one quote has stuck with me:
 Ken Baldwin jumped from the bridge many years ago, in 1985 (a two-hundred-foot fall that statistically leads to death 97% of the time), but the instant he did so, in midair, he was hit by a horrifying realization: "I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was in fact totally fixable - except for having just jumped."
 With that sudden desire to live, Baldwin managed to change his body posture just before impact so that he hit the water feet-first rather than head-first (which would have meant certain death.) Even hitting feet-first, the only possible survivable posture, he still suffered numerous, severe injuries to his body. But he did survive, and went on to tell the tale and live a transformed life.
 If you are ever suicidal, for whatever reason, please take his words to heart - whatever you may feel in your life is "unfixable", may in fact be totally fixable or something that can be lived with. Don't wait until you're in mid-air after having leapt from a building or bridge to come to that realization.

 I will be flying to Vietnam this week!! It's been my dream ever since 2019 to film and capture the essence of this wonderful country. I want to know from you all, the local people about where I can go to capture Hanoi at its traditional and cultural best.
 1) What are some of the iconic monuments, markets, and places that are Hanoi exclusive?
 2) Which streets give away that Vietnamese essence right away? Where are the food stalls?
 3) What activities do Vietnamese/Hanoi people do in the morning? (Do they go fishing in some lake? Do they set up their morning stalls? If so, where? (Please help with the exact areas/locations) 
 4) What are some of the events that I need to attend? (I am gonna be there on December 28 and from December 30 - January 3. I know, it's just 4 days but I am ambitious to capture as much as I can.)
 I know I can Google this but I am looking for recommendations from people who actually live in Vietnam. Appreciate it a whole lot if you can help with all the details! Thanks for your time! Let me know if you can join me for the morning/evening/late-night photography/film walks! Would love to connect and enjoy some cups of coffee together!

 I recently became a U.S. citizen and have a U.S. passport. I plan to travel to Vietnam next May for 40 days, so I want to use my Vietnamese passport (still valid until 2025) to enter Vietnam and avoid the visa requirement, but my name is different on the two passports (I changed my name). I'm unsure if I should book my roundtrip plane ticket in my old name (on Vietnamese passport) or new name (in U.S. passport)? Or should I just apply for 2 e-visas?
 Another thing is my mom wants me to renew my chứng minh nhân dân (identity card) too. Is it okay to use my Vietnamese name for that too?
 Thank you for your help!

I just completed the trip recently, and it was the best trip I have ever taken in my entire life. I did the trip solo on a 150cc Honda Winner X motorbike, and the journey was 4,108 kms in total. I was gone for 29 days (28 nights), and it cost me just over 30,000,000 VND for everything. 
 I really loved seeing how beautiful Vietnam is. My favorite cities were: Da Lat, Hoi An, Ninh Binh and Sapa. I stayed in 14 different cities throughout my trip, staying for 2 nights in each city as I made my way to the north of Vietnam. I was amazed at how diverse the landscapes were; one day you're riding along the coastal beach line and the next you are winding through mountainous regions.

 I’m sorry if this question has been asked a lot but the situation in the other posts are a little different. So, thought I’d ask again.
 I was born in Australia. Both my parents were born in Vietnam. At the time of my birth, my dad was an Australian citizen (so I got Australian citizenship automatically) and my mum was a Vietnamese citizen. My mum has Australian citizenship now but she never gave up her VN citizenship (not sure if she automatically lost it).
 I currently have my mum’s birth certificate, national ID (CMND) from the 80s, and old VN passport from the 90s (expired). Would this be enough for me to apply for my first VN passport? Any other Australians went through the same process?
 Asking my mum to renew her passport is completely out of the question so I’d like to know if I can do this myself lol.
 I’ll call the consulate in Sydney some time but just wanted to hear from others first. 😊

 So question, is it hard to move to Vietnam? We'd like to stay at least 1 year and a half? Any advices? We both live in a different country (yes, we are long distance for 3 years now). 
 Thank you everyone!

 https://www.gourmettraveller.com.au/recipes/chefs-recipes/braised-beef-cheeks-in-sarsaparilla-7233
 Just noticed while typing this that the recipe is by a Vietnamese chef and TV personality in Australia. Daniel Hong. Famous enough to have his own page on Wikipedia.
 Too much work, and not enough time, so I opted to use the remaining of instant bo kho jar in the fridge instead. Into the Instant Pot, it went.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarsaparilla_(soft_drink)
 "In Vietnam, sarsaparilla is one of the flavors (Xá Xị) sold under the Mirinda brand, bottled and distributed by Suntory-PepsiCo Vietnam Beverage (formerly, PepsiCo Vietnam).[22] There is also a sarsi flavored soda (Huong Xá Xị) under the Fanta brand.[23] There are two local brands offering their own sarsi drink:
 Sá Xị Chương Dương by Chuong Duong Beverages. Wonderfarm Zizy by Interfood Shareholding Company. 
 Sarsaparilla-flavored sodas are available in the south of Vietnam but much more difficult to find in the north. "
 What's your favorite brand of xá xị? Anyone know where I can them in U.S.? I wonder if xá xị drink is available. There are plenty of xá xị flavored drinks.

 It involved a child and his greedy father. There was a phoenix who flew both to grab goods from a nearby island (I think gold and starfruit) but the father grabbed too much gold and weighed the phoenix down while flying on its back. 
 The phoenix looked animatronic if this helps :(. I imagine there’s a ton of versions of this since it’s a popular folklore. Thank you!

I'll be returning with my partner for the month of February and we're wondering if there's a unique/fun way to travel from Hanoi to Da Nang that involves seeing some sights along the way. Or, alternatively, if it's worth just flying instead to cut the duration of the trip. We'd like to see Ninh Binh but my understanding is that we could do that in a day or two from Hanoi and then return and fly out to Da Nang. 
 Any insight appreciated! Thanks very much.

 For a couple of reasons, it’s faster for the employees to make, and I like my coffee black. Anywho, the coffee only cost 12k. I noticed, that the first few times I had ordered my coffee, some of the clerks would fill it a little less than half of the cup. Now! That I have consistently go there everyday, I get the best coffee around town. O don’t even need to tell them my order, instead the clerk would automatically ask me, “black? No ice, no sugar?” I love it! Plus, this time comes around there’s this clerk that just doesn’t care about the amount he gives me. The dude fills it to the brink. Kudos to him! Let me know if this hack works for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I've been living in Vietnam for a while now, and this is something that's started to grate on me a bit.
 Most of the vietnamese teachers that I have gone out to eat with, have invited to my house, sang karaoke with, and thought I'd gotten friendlier with, still call me just "teacher" even though I've long since told them they can just call me by my name unless in front of students in which case they can call me "Teacher _____". I also always call them by their name or nickname, unless it's someone I'm not that familiar with.
 ​
 It's kind of like insisting on calling someone "Doctor" or "Sir" after they've already allowed you to call them by name, like they want to keep the relationship distant to less than acquaintances, which is fine if that's what they want, I won't have to join their drinking sessions anymore haha.
 ​
 Is this normal in vietnam? I have a vietnamese friend that says in their language they just call each other by name, but when I discuss it with the teachers they say they are just being "polite" in their culture. I even told them I prefer to be called by my name and they still say, "hello Teacher."

 We aren't that close, but she's Vietnamese but now lives in the UK. I was drawn her for seceet Santa, so I'm looking for a gift for around £25.
 Does anyone have any ideas of something I may be able to get her from the UK? Posting here because I'd like it to be related to Vietnam, rather than just some generic gift

I have never been to Vietnam at all in my life. So I have to choose to either fly in to, and visit, Hanoi or Ho Chi Minch City. Either one, or the other, but not both. Which one should I choose, and why?
 I am interested in seeing anything old and interesting (old buildings, temples, markets). If there is a mountain nearby I can go to that's a plus. Nicer weather (this will be in February). Good eating (cheap street food?). Which of the two cities is cleaner, less crazy driving and/or street congestion (human).
 I'm not interested in bars, romance or shopping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[my partner and I are traveling to vietnam next month and are sorting out our plans - one thing we’ve been considering is a motorbike tour (this 4 day tour from Dalat to HCMC in particular: https://www.easy-riders.net/tours/tours-from-dalat/442-easy-rider-dalat-to-saigon.html). Neither of us have a motorbike license or any experience with bikes so we’d have to ride pillion and it is a bit pricey ($400 USD).
 Has anyone done these types of tours before and is it worth it?? It seems like a really amazing way to see the country but we’re torn of whether if it’s the best use of time/money.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I‘m traveling to Hanoi at Christmas and want to do a brief Vietnamese course (German or English). I‘m searching for something that lasts about half a day to get familiar with the language in general, as I read that it is a vocal language. It would also be great to get in contact with locals and Vietnamese culture. Do you have some suggestions, please? :)
