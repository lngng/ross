 Background: I'm Vietnamese- born and raised in vietnam but moved to United States at very young age. I'm still able to retain the language. My girlfriend is Egyptian born and raised in Egypt, and also moved to United States at a very young age. You rarely see Vietnamese/Egyptian couples in the states...which makes our relationship very unique. Both of our culture values are very similar. Most would think that Arab are muslim...which is true but my gf and I are both christian but different domination...anyways that's a whole different conversation of it own. My parents are very traditional. they would want me to date and marry to a Vietnamese girl. However to me, i should be able date anyone regardless of culture/race. Every time i would talk about girls outside of the culture they will give racist remarks.
 Question: How would i go about introducing my Girlfriend to my traditional Vietnamese parents without them having a prejudice mindset?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! 
 I'm in Hanoi for three weeks and occasionally need to do some work. I just need a normal desk with an office chair and a monitor. I contacted some co-working spaces, which would be perfect because they charge by the day, but they don't offer any hardware (monitor, keyboard and a mouse).
 Another option would be to go to a gaming cafe and just plug their hardware into my laptop. Has anyone done that?
 Would renting the equipment be an option? Tried googling, but only a single really expensive option came up. Buying doesn't work as I will be traveling around Vietnam. 
 There should be quite a lot of digital nomads in Vietnam, so someone has to have dealt with the same problem. Didn't find any on this subreddit tho.
 Thanks!
 PS! I'll probably face the same problem in January at Da Nang, so any info on the way of the land over there would also be much appreciated.

But looking at how Bangladesh managed to get Russian help then I suppose it's the government's fault for having fallen into Western "renewable energy trap". We know that only nuclear energy can support economy better than renewables. So what are your opinions ?

 The Southeast Asian electronics manufacturing hub is home to Intel's largest factory worldwide for assembling, packaging and testing chips, and has been banking on the company further expanding there especially after Joe Biden announced deals to support Vietnam's chips industry during a visit in September.
 Vietnam is keen to position itself as an alternative to China and Taiwan, amid political risks and trade tensions with the United States.
 But shortly after Biden's visit, U.S. officials informed a select group of U.S. businessmen …]]></summary>

I don’t know how to swim which I know is embarrassing and as it turns out one of the bucket list things to do is in ha long bay is kayaking. We’re doing the cruise which is fine but is kayaking something that’s recommended even for someone who can’t swim? Would I miss out on a lot if I don’t do it? My friends are okay with me just staying on the cruise and waiting but if it’s safe enough then I might give in. Any suggestions or opinions are welcome. Thank you!

 I think I’ve got a pretty solid itinerary planned, but since it’s the holiday season I’m hoping to pick up some unique souvenirs and gifts to bring back to the U.S. I found a shop in Ho Chi Minh City called OHQUAO that seems pretty great - unique paper goods/design. Wondering if there are other shops like this people would recommend I check out? I really enjoy shopping for home goods, art/decor, stuff like that.
 Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

We were walking along My Khe beach late afternoon in the rain, and suddenly noticed parts of the water got darker， with several cockroaches washed up on shore, some live ones were crawling around that area as well. I was shocked to see the sewage overflowing into the water. Is My Khe beach clean enough to swim? Or any suggestions for other beach areas north or south of my khe that may be more clean/safe?

 I’m a vietnamese American living in America and currently pregnant with our first baby. Recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have to meet glucose levels set by American medical institutes. Given that I’m ethnically Asian and grew up eating Asian food at home and maintain Việt culture at home life- I am apt to believe a lot of the American medical standards don’t fit me as I’m not the same genetic or dietary background as most of their standards which is collective studies base on the “average” white person (since white ppl make up the majority of the population in america) so was curious what vietnam did for gestational diabetes 
 Thanks!

 How can I explain it to my parents? My viet is crap and I wasn't able to find so many articles on it. I would also like to show them some articles/videos in Vietnamese that will support what my doctor and I agreed on, which is a lower carbohydrate diet and its benefits, and why she should not be eating so many carbohydrates (80% of diet)

 In 1075-1077, the Vietnamese Ly Dynasty launched an invasion deep into Song China's territory. They were still a small kingdom that only gained independence 100 years ago and were attacking the strongest empire on earth at the time. The Song responded by invading Vietnam but they were defeated.
 The Mongols also invaded Vietnam and were defeated in all 3 times.
 While the Ming Dynasty conquered Vietnam in 1407, they were only able to hold Vietnam for 20 years.
 In 1471, Vietnam managed to wipe out Champa, which was an enemy for over 500 years out of existence. This is akin to France wiping Spain or Germany out of existence.

 We see a post or more about Vietnamese women literally EVERY single day. So far, so good.
 Since it's MORE than obvious what you guys want, why don't you simply go to one of these waaaay to many happy ending massage parlors or sex workers in the first place, where you get the benefit of knowing what you're paying for and also know HOW MUCH you're going to pay.
 Two friends visited me once in Hanoi and they were super excited about the chance to get laid with some asian girls. They were talking about it the whole time before they even arrived. Even though i opposed that, I showed them places where they could get what they want, for no more than 1.5M. However, they proceeded to text me in the morning to tell me that they managed to spe…]]></summary>

 EDIT: ‼️he is not blood related‼️ 😫 my grandma married this man, where this man already had two other baby mama’s before my grandma. So this cousin is from this grandpa’s other baby mama’s side where he is a cousin from a mom who married into this grandpa’s family.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stayed at two hotels now and both were not good. They looked nothing like the pictures and even though they had good reviews, it seems like the reviews were lies. 
 The rooms were terribly small. One had no window whatsoever. The "pool" was like 2 feet deep. The "gym" was two treadmills and a bike. The construction quality of the rooms and bathrooms were shoddy. Everything felt thin and cheap. You can hear everything happening through the walls. 
 On the plus side, the staff were always extremely kind and helpful. I really loved the service. The breakfast nuggets were always good as well. 
 Both hotels were half a million dong per night. 
 Do I just need to find more expensive hotels? What's a good budget for something decent but not extravagant? A million dongs?

I will add that I am Vietnamese myself, and I call all my cousins whose parents are older than mine "chị/anh" (vice versa for younger and "em"), but is this the standard? Was curious since it does sometimes lead to me calling my cousins who are much older than me "Em" and my middle schooler cousins "Anh", and I always found it a bit funny

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in my mid 30s and visiting Vietnam right now. I feel like I look so much younger than all the men here. I am constantly calling them anh. 
 Seems like this is especially true in Saigon. Is it the pollution? The constant hustle of city life? The cigarette smoking? The beer consumption? Poor quality of food? 
 In phu quoc, I notice ppl look a bit younger and overall happier.

If he is tired, then he should say he needs a time off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something I have noticed during my time in Vietnam is that in many of the stores, restaurants etc you go into (generally the more expensive ones) the staff give the ‘hello sir’ and then just sort of stand right near you and watch, as you browse, as you decide, as you calculate cash for the bill etc. I’ve even had it where there are multiple workers stood looking at me. I find it incredibly off-putting and it usually just makes me want to leave immediately as I feel under pressure.
 Has anybody else noticed this phenomena? Is it normal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From my many years of travelling, visiting all of Southeast Asia except Laos and Myanmar, East Asia and India, it's my first time an airport staff aggressively shouted at me. 
 After the Immigration, the guy who checks your passport and boarding pass in the final security check, alerted me that there's an issue with my check-in baggage. He told me to wait in the waiting area. I was very nervous since it's the first time that my baggage was questioned. And I kept thinking of worst case scenario like finding illegal items and being fined etc. I was waiting for a few minutes and asked politely (saying "Sir") and he said that the staff from the airline is arriving. There's no one at the security screening at that point and after several minutes, asked him politely again, and then he shouted in a loud aggressive voice "I TOLD YOU TO WAIT HUH. WAIT!! " and I was shocked by that aproach. Even his fellow staff looked at him. 
 I was shaken by his aggressive reply and just sat in my seat while he just turned his back at me. Fortunately, the airline staff arrived and accompanied me at the baggage screening. It was a pocket wifi and it's carry on only. After clearing, I went to other side of security and went to boarding gates.
 (Also earlier, the lady at the check-in counter seems very testy, the way she processed the check-in procedures) 
 The staff at Saigon Airport seems to be in a lot of stress and not very friendly. I really had a bad experience on this Airport and it made a pretty bad impression as a visitor, , unlike the ones in Hanoi and Da Nang.. Honestly, from the attitude of staff and the whole airport experience (queueing, check-in), it's much worse than the comparable NAIA (Manila) T3. Next time, I will choose Da Nang or Hanoi Airport.

 we don’t have any cuisine preferences, but maybe not chinese food? (because we have a LOT of that from where we’re from haha)
 i’m a student, so my budget is about $40-50 usd for us both. 
 thanks so much in advance! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Looking for some input and if I should remove or add any days anywhere in particular and if I'm missing something. I'm a medium paced traveller, don't take things too slow but neither rush through the trip. 
 I'm into cozy hotels (not too expensive), historical sites & museums, local food, drinks & coffee places. I'm not a nightlife person and usually stay away from crazy spots - doesn't mean that I don't like to visit and see them for a couple hours. I want to make the best out of my Vietnam trip. 
 I'm planning the following route in my Vietnam trip for so many days:
 Hanoi 4
 Ha Long Bay 2 (Here I plan a one night trip where they come pick you up from hotel and return you the next day - any agency you'd recommend? looking at prices online I expect around 350 euro pp)
 Ninh Binh 2 (Saw that can be done as a day trip but many people recommend spending the night)
 Sapa 3 (Here is the most uncertain part of the trip, not sure if worth spending the 6 hours of train/bus to reach here, stay 1 full day, and return the 3rd day - any experiences on how to proceed best?) 
 Hanoi 1 (coming back from Sapa and prepare for flight to Da Nang)
 Da Nang/Hue/Hoi An 5 (any idea how many days I should spend in each? I'm reading that Hoi An would be the best out of these 3 cities so I don't mind cutting 1 city to spend more time in Hoi An) 
 HCMC 3 
 Phu quoc/ Con Dao 4 (I still have to decide which of the islands I should go to - price wise flight from HCMC is similar but I'm reading plenty of negative stuff on Phu Q so I'm leaning more towards Con Dao).

 I am looking for some advice. I come from the UK and for Christmas I would like to get my partner a Vietnamese food themed hamper. He has absolutely fallen in love with the food and culture, so I wanted to get him something special for Christmas. So far in the hamper is a cookbook, personalised chopsticks, nuoc chan sauce. All these I can source quite easily in the UK. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Perhaps some traditional drinks or snacks? And if so, ideas of where I can buy them?
 Thank you so much!

I am looking for a small village accessible by bus from Hanoi within 3 hours max that would have beautiful scenery, nice cooler weather and off the beaten path. I am open to more touristy options if they are really nice. I plan on doing a writing retreat and want as less distraction as possible, but would look forward for some nice mountain scenery or old village charm that i could easily stroll through on foot or bike. Thanks!

 What would you say the weather is like from early December to early Jan in Da Nang? 
 Too wet and best to try another time? Or not too wet and it’s worth staying a month starting early December? 
 I’m keen to surf, spend time by the beach, walk by the beach.

So apparently when someone gets hit, the driver will often turn around and try to "finish him/her off" since it's cheaper to pay for their funeral than all their medical expenses. 
 Is this true? Can someone link an article(s) where this actually took place. Sounds plausible yet comical.

 Một nguồn thông tin cho hay, Cơ quan CSĐT (Công an TP.HCM) vừa tống đạt các quyết định khởi tố vụ án, khởi tố bị can và thi hành lệnh bắt tạm giam đối với ông P.V.H. (47 tuổi, ngụ TP.Thủ Đức) về hành vi “Mua dâm người dưới 18 tuổi”.
 Các quyết định và lệnh trên đã được Viện KSND cùng cấp phê chuẩn.
 Ông P.V.H. đã bị tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân. Ông này từng mang cấp hàm Thượng tá, nguyên là phó khoa của trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân, trụ sở ở TP.HCM.
 Bước đầu, ông P. đã thừa nhận có hành vi mua bán dâm đối với bé gái 15 tuổi.
 Ngày 3/11, trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân đã có thông báo gửi đến công an các đơn vị, một số địa phương, học viện, trường, bệnh viện CAND về việc kỷ luật cán bộ. 
 Theo thông báo, vị phó khoa này bị kỷ luật bằng hình thức “tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân” từ ngày 1/11.
 Vụ án đang được Cơ quan CSĐT Công an TP.HCM mở rộng điều tra.

 We are flying out of Ho Chi Min on the 3rd of Jan late in the day so we were hoping to spend new years somewhere else, maybe Phu Quoc or does anyone have any other recommendations for South Vietnam? We don't want to be stuck on the streets with millions of people so either a big beach style party or something really elegant maybe, a resort with events would work also but I can't seem to find anything specific.

But a memo went out where I work that it would be required next year (I think nationally it already is, but whatever....) Anyway, my BMI is very low even for Vietnamese standards 44-45 kg at 170 cm. I'm a man. Otherwise healthy although I have had my blood pressure tested in the moderate to high zone at times, although other times it was normal. Not sure if I had nerves at the exam, but it has come out high in some exams. Not sure if I have any other issues. I can teach 12 hours straight if necessary, not sure why we need a confirmation of what can be seen, but what could get my visa not renewed? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I received a call informing me that the train I was traveling on SP3 had been cancelled, and my ticket would now be changed to SP1. I also received a text message, and I had no suspicion at the time.
 Just now, someone called me and asked me where I was. He said he would meet me at the Hanoi station and put me on the train. I thought to myself: The service of Vietnam Railway is really good.
 After I entered Hanoi Station, I found that the sp3 train had not been cancelled. There were many people in the train, and I could tell at a glance that they were also tourists. At the same time, I saw the person who called me. He was wearing a "xx travel" T-shirt but not the blue uniform of the Vietnam Railway . He put me on the train and told me he was sorry. I think I roughly understood it, and I didn't expose him. I didn't suffer any loss, and I knew that he was just an ordinary office worker who just wanted to complete his work.
 I guess maybe more people joined the tour group, but they didn’t have enough train tickets, so they randomly selected a few lucky passengers like us and lied to them. This should be something that tour groups operate and Vietnam Railways acquiesces to.

Getting the later flights allowed me to return home from work to collect luggage and then be on the island in good time. 
 However more recently I wanted to go back and found myself completely unable to find any flight that flies after 6.45pm. I checked multiple airlines, even seeing if booking a month or two made any difference. I couldn’t find anything. 
 Anyone got any idea what the hell is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently in hcmc and it’s my first week in Vietnam so excuse my lack of cultural wit.
 Today I was trying to park my bike and a random looking guy showed up. He started scribbling something on a piece of paper so I assumed he wanted to charge me for the parking. I told him to show me some kind of ID but he wouldn’t so I told him to get lost and just left the bike there. On my way back I realised he’s moved the bike to the middle of the road. I’ve got a few questions:
  
Do these people charge money for parking?
 
If so, on what basis? Like, do they own the parking spaces?
 
If they do charge, do I just trust any random looking dude here and hand them in my money?
 
What is his job exactly, how does anyone benefit from his services?
 
 Also I do apologise if I just broke some social standards. The only similar experience I’ve had was in Naples where local drug addicts demand money for parking, and I’ve been advised by my Italian friend to just ignore them. I would really like to know how to deal with this here in Vietnam.

So, it made me think, what do the Vietnamese thinks of fellow SEasians? In my 8 days in Vietnam, I only noticed a handful of them. Most are Koreans and Indians. 
 As a Filipino, I was surprised that we're the biggest spenders in Vietnam. I was also mistaken for a Thai a lot. It seems that Thai tourists frequent Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think you guys could relate to this.
 Growing we’ve all probably heard some variation of this. Where your parents would stop you from misbehaving by saying “oh if you don’t do this, a cop will arrest you” or “if you don’t stop doing this, that man over there will kidnapped you”.
 I thought that that kind of parenting was something that is long gone by time our generation came around. 
 But lo and behold, just this evening while I was enjoying a drink a mother near me was trying to get her daughter to eat. Now I wasn’t paying attention because it wasn’t my business… until the mother looks over at me and said “if you don’t eat that man will kidnapped you”. I was the only other customer there so I knew for a fact she was talking about me.
 And I just… didn’t know what to do or say, I just look over at them surprise for a few second while she continue, saying how I’m gonna do it and where I’ll take her
 I paid and left pretty quickly after that but how do you responded to something like that? WHY are we still doing something like that?!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of October 31, 2023. Prime Video became unavailable to Vietnam users. Refund will be sent to subscribers. 
  
"Unplugging Prime Video: The What and The Why Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming arm, has been a part of Vietnam’s digital entertainment spectrum since 2016. The service, akin to Netflix, brought a plethora of international films and TV shows to Vietnamese screens. But come October 2023, active subscriptions will be cancelled, and full refunds will be issued. Additionally, Prime Gaming benefits will also become inaccessible.
  
While Amazon remains silent on the rationale behind this closure, industry insiders speculate Vietnamese regulations may hold the key. The country mandates transnational paid broadcasting services to obtain licenses—a hurdle that Amazon seems unwilling to surmount. However, this is merely conjecture in the absence of an official explanation."

 I’m on cat ba island from 16th until 20th and I need a strong and secure WiFi connection to try and get tickets to a festival that usually sells out very quickly (Glastonbury festival). 
 It looks like the hostel we are staying in has poor WiFi, so does anyone know the best spots for strong WiFi on the island? Any good hotels or internet cafes? We’re thinking of checking into an Airbnb with private WiFi on the final night just to see if it’ll help our chances of getting a ticket. 
 Any advice welcome! Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm a European guy who recently travelled in Vietnam for a month.
 On one day I decided to travel on my motorbike to a nearby town that wasn't touristy at all, because I wanted to see more of the real Vietnamese life.
 I ended up sitting in a cafe with a Vietnamese stranger. We drank coffee, smoked, talked through translate and had fun. I'm 19, he's 27 with a young child if that matters.
 We ended up meeting again, travelling around and he showed me some sights. At the end of the day he insisted I slept at his house. Here I sat with him and his younger brother, we talked and eventually I went to sleep.
 Next day, I have to leave early to book a bus. My Vietnamese friend/host also had to leave early. When I was about to leave I saw a woman and I asked him if that's his mom. He said yes.
 I told him I wanted to go thank her for letting me stay at her house. He declined. I insisted. He declined again, he seemed to really not want me to do that.
 His mom, who seemed to me doing some chores, didn't acknowledge me at all, not even look at me.
 I found this super weird. Why was this the case?
 I'm not sure if this is a personal thing or could have to do with Vietnamese culture. Maybe I did something wrong. If it has to do with culture, do you know why this happened?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Vietnamese friends, I am from New Delhi India and I visited Vietnam for the first time, this was my second international trip and it changed the way I look at life. I stayed 2 nights in Ha-long bay and four nights in Hanoi old quarter. The people of your country are some of the warmest people I have met in my life, your roads are so clean, and even though you feel you will be run over people coolly navigate around you. No one is rude to you on the other hand I was helped by locals from falling into a tourist trap, every country had good and bad people. The majority of your country had great people with big hearts. You don’t disrespect neither do you have a demeanor where someone can try to undermine or disrespect you, maybe the years of war and made you so strong yet so humble. Money is the basis of all economies yet in your country, majority folk don’t give it the importance it’s given the world over. Food was so fresh and the amount of fruits you eat and the fresh seafood shows on your flawless skins. The women take the cake in hard work and yet manage to look so elegant in whatever they wear, they are such boss ladies it’s commendable. There are other countries in South Asia which have built economies on sex work, yet yours keeps its head held high and aims to give a more wholesome experience to any visitor.
 I write this from my bed in India, sad and depressed at having come back from such a lovely country which I wish was like my second home!
 Thank you Vietnam 🇻🇳 🙏🏻

Tớ muốn hỏi các bạn thể giới thiệu cho tớ một số ban nhạc Việt Nam giống kiểu Rock, Jazz hay City Pop, nhưng nhạc Việt Nam nà cũng được.

It was pointed out that this building did not meet JITCO regulations even before it was built, but this company stated that this was not a problem because Vietnamese people live in worse conditions in their home countries. But the regulation that the minimum bedroom size per person should be 4.5 m2 on average was established. In response to this issue this company made a donation of 4 million to Yoshitaka Shindo. As a result, this rule was changed and the aforementioned building is no longer in violation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never like taking taxis anyway, I usually use Grab but my mom is a little more old-fashioned so whenever I’m traveling with her at the Tan Son Nhat airport she insists on using a taxi. She is Native Viet and I am Việt kiều. 
 First time, they scammed us to pay double/triple a normal fare price (and I know taxis to and from airport are already higher end, so it was double that price already). 
 Second time I gave them the hotel address, which was a chain hotel. Dude didn’t want to drive across town and said this particular chain accepts any reservation at any of their locations so he dropped us off at the hotel chain spot close to the hotel. I was already suspicious when he said this, but my mom accepted it readily and didn’t argue. She’s been living in Vietnam for over two years now for retirement and also grew up here, so if she thought it was fine I wasn’t going to argue either, especially since I was exhausted from a long flight. Obviously it turned out not to be true and the hotel receptionist said as much and called us a cab to our actual hotel reservation. 
 Even after these two incidents my mom still goes to the taxis when leaving the airport as she says there are no other options. However, to book a Grab car to pickup from airport you just have to walk to the airport parking lot and they’ll pick you up from there. She struggles with technology and apps though and still feels more comfortable using the taxis even knowing they’re overpriced and scammy. But for anyone who’s comfortable with using apps and booking a Grab, go for that option. Teach the older folk how to use it too. These taxis are atrocious.

It’s one the greatest embarrassment this country has to offer. Custom and Border officers truly brought great shame. One dude looks like he’s day drunk, the other officer cleared 3-4 people while he cleared only one. Elderly people and crying babies standing in line for hours. Every officers look visibly pissed off. What a great way to welcome foreigners to our country. This officer got my blood boiling when he physically push a Japanese tourist back in line, the tourist was simply chatting with his group because they have to wait 2 hours in line. He later show extreme irritation to the dude, slam his passport on the table in a rude manner. The Japanese tourist was in shock. Godd!!! It pissed me off everytime I land in this god forsaken ass place. Not to mention getting a taxi out of the airport. It’s extremely chaotic, unorganized, and everything is in disorder with no clear direction. Im amazed people still visit this country. Because that is some of the shittiest welcome any country could ever give.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: I am leaving. Perhaps with a different company, or if there were a different demographic of people in my tour group, I would have stuck it out, but my gut is telling me to leave. Some odd things have happened that are not just related to the party culture. These people are racist. Guys, always trust your gut.
 Hi all, I (20F, poc) scheduled a Ha Giang easy rider loop tour through a hostel after all the rave reviews online. I arrive, and quickly realize that this is all just one big excuse for young white European people to drink and party. I felt extremely uncomfortable my first night here, before the tour starts, as I did not come to Vietnam to drink with strangers, don’t like these people in my group, and am uninterested in the tourist drinking and partying scene. I don’t know why I didn’t do better research to see what a terrible tourist trap Ha Giang has become. I wanted a beautiful nature motorbike tour, but I am thinking of canceling because I don’t want to drink and don’t want to be the only person of color in the group, already half-excluded.
 Has anyone felt the same way when visiting Southeast Asia, and how did you avoid this? I’m here to travel solo, decompress, enjoy nature and different cities and locals, not interested in making friends with other tourists.
 And now, I’m not sure what to do. Is the loop still worth it if I don’t want to party at night and just feel uncomfortable with the people in my group? I’m thinking of just bailing and going back to Hanoi, which I loved.

 Backstory: my mom is Vietnamese but lives in Sweden. Her brother is holding either half (or on the contract, currently holding) her house for her until she retires and moves there in the future. Now grown up and having seen my family members patterns, I’m almost too sure that a conflict will arise in the future from this. Mainly between my moms brother, and his wife. The two aren’t too fond of each other. Another red flag I noticed during a trip to VN one summer was that my uncle started tearing up and making a whole scene in front of everyone when my mom just calmly asked for her name to also be included on the papers for the house. He was screaming about being accused of being greedy when no one approached it that way. I felt like he was scared and projecting. 
 Any advice is appreciated. I’d hate to see my family members fight over four walls in the future. 
 PS. This property was gifted to specifically my mom from her parents. My grandparents made sure each one of their kids got a retirement property.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't assume a rational explanation for this question exists, but why are there so many adults who ride around on their motorcycles while their child is sitting on the back with their head exposed to the whatever could happen on these mean streets of VN. 
 Parents "protect" their own heads but not their own childrens. Yesterday during a massive downpour of rain, a father sat comfortably in his helmet and raincoat while his daughter sat on the back, cold, wet and at risk of head injury should they crash.
 At least for me, if there is only one helmet, my passenger gets it. 
 if there is one raincoat and we can't share, my passenger gets it. 
 I honestly can't imagine a world where you love your children but won't sacrifice a helmet or raincoat for them.

 I've tried Phu Tho in District 10 and it was great the 1st time but then the 2nd time some lady said I had to rent it out just to shoot around on a court that was empty and dark with no lighting. 
 There's another court called Seventy Seven and that one was pretty cool but it looked more of a "friends getting together and pitching in to play" type of deal. It didn't have a very "pick up" style feel to it at all. 
 There is a gymnasium in District 3 and you need to rent that one out as well. Apparently, the Ho Chi Minh City Wings play at this location. 
 I haven't even looked at District 1 yet, but I'm starting to kind of feel you need to rent a whole court out to get anything going.
 Maybe we can get a group going of at least 10 of us getting together to rent a court out together. I'm just trying to run 5 vs 5 for an hour or so to get a good work out in. 
 I'm going to try Phu Tho again because today might have just been a wierd off day as last time I was there, it actually felt like a normal park where people just rolled up and started playing pick up.
 I know basketball is not very big in Vietnam but for a developing city with 9 million people in it, I expected more out of the basketball community.

 The second one: "my ex make $100k monthly" lol wtf
 From what I've heard, the medium-high salary for a Vietnamese person and an American are $1000 and $4000, respectively, but I might be wrong. I just curious what the average income in Vietnam and in big cities (in Vietnam) is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I share the same sentiment. And I was born and raised in Vietnam. Every once in a while you run into someone who’s kinda old, but not that old, and you don’t know if you should call them anh or chú. 
 Same with the women: idk if they’re old enough for me to call them cô or chị without offending them
 Edit: Just remembered something else about pronouns so figured I’ll blow y’all mind. 
 Within the family tree of Vietnam, you call your cousins anh/chị/em, not based on age but based on your parents age. In other words, if my father has a younger brother, and they both have children, my uncle’s kid would have to call me anh/chị regardless of age. This means it is possible that I am anh/chị even if I’m the younger cousin!!
 Another thing is if within a family tree, a person is on the same generation as your parents, you call them cô/dì/chú/bác. So for a large family with 1st generation of 5, it is possible to have some people of the 2nd generation younger than some people in the 3rd generation!! But the people in the 3rd generation still have to call the 2nd gen people cô dì chú bác cậu mợ, regardless of age

We've seen some people say online that it will be fine, and others say that vietjet likes to make customers rebook their tickets for the slightest error. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Vietnam, a traveler bold and true,
 Found happiness for a part we seldom knew,
 Amidst lush landscapes and cultures so grand,
 His Anus danced with joy in this distant land.
 Bidets and bum guns, a revelation sweet,
 Made cleanliness a daily, pleasant treat,
 No more rough paper, it was all so clean,
 In Vietnam, his rear was like a gleam.
 But fate can twist a traveler's joy to pain,
 As food, exotic, brought discomfort's reign,
 A dodgy dish, it left him in despair,
 And his happy Anus turned grumpy with a glare.
 In moments of delight and sudden strife,
 A traveler's tale unfolds in life,
 From happiness to grump, a twist so stark,
 In Vietnam, his Anus found a journey marked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm potentially moving to District 1 in HCMC, depending on the work visa stuff. I should be getting a little bit higher salary, but the condos seem so much more expensive that it might not even make sense.
 I'm looking around at condos just through google search (DotProperty, RentApartmentVN, etc) and I haven't seen anything for less than $390. Or around 10 million VND. These condos look like normal condos, with no furniture and maybe a swimming pool. In Bangkok I've got a normal condo, that came with furniture and swimming pool and gym for $280/month.
 It's hard for me to believe that HCMC is that much more expensive than BKK but I really don't know. I've seen people here say with $300 you could rent a mansion, but I'm not seeing anything like that all, not do I want a mansion. Just a 1 bedroom studio with a pool or gym or some kind of recreational thing to do at the condo, or in the area for around $300 USD, maybe around 8M VND, is that's reasonable. 
 Is HCMC really that much more expensive in terms of renting a condo? Or am I just looking in the wrong places?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm taking a Vietnamese class in the US and my teacher said that for 3rd person pronouns we can use "đó" instead of "ấy." As in "cô đó mua xe hơi" translating to "she buys a car," and "anh đó có phải là kỹ sư không?" translating to "is he an engineer?". She said "cô đó" would be used more in the south than "cô ấy" as a 3rd person pronoun. 
 I was wondering if this is correct or maybe I am misunderstanding her explanation? (Her English is a bit difficult to understand sometimes.)
 For some background info, my teacher is in her late 60s and moved to the US in her 20s from central/southern Viet Nam. She is trying to teach the southern accent/dialect, but our textbook is Northern so it is confusing sometimes. 
 TLDR: Is "cô đó" the southern equivalent of "cô ấy" as a 3rd person pronoun?

 I have ridden my R15 through Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and into the border town of Myanmar before and I would love to visit Vietnam (HCMC to Hanoi) via Cambodia before exiting into Laos and back into Thailand. 
 Does anyone know if this is possible, and if so, how I can go about it? Thank you!

 I thought doctors are generally paid really well. I'm trying to get an idea of how their pay would compare with a normal working person in vn.
 Do doctors usually have a decent salary/earning in Vietnam?

We’ll be visiting Ha long city for just an overnight and we’ll be staying around the Quang Ninh area near the Tuan Chau bridge, aside from taking a ferry to Cat Ba Island though will only probably do it for a nice view of the ocean and bay and then be back again to the town since we can’t ride a motorbike to explore the island. What else can we do around the town? Is there any cool cafes there? :) 
 also, will probably just chill at the beach admiring the view haha

 I want to ask those who had a chance to study abroad for such amount of time and/or live in Germany: Does it worth it? Can it really change yourself a whole lot, in terms of thinking, studying, relationships, etc? Can this experience somehow be helpful for some of my future plans like looking for Masters scholarships abroad or working in an international environment?

 Given that there are at least 2 million people belonging to either the military or the police, don't they ever think 'man, why can't I at least go to Thailand for a fun weekend'?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a high school student, currently 12th grade.
 I have been struggling with school ever since 7th grade, and as far as it seems, it is only getting worse over time.
 I believe that I may have ADHD, or something of sort related to mentality. But I cannot confirm yet without a proper doctor checkup.
 I am too afraid to talk with my parents about it, as they are very keen on education, and I am scared that they would constantly scold me and make it worse if I were to talk to them about it.
 Right now, I don't have any motivation to continue school. The first mid-semester exam is coming and I cannot focus on a single thing for even a second.
 What can I do to help myself? Or what should I do to make my parents be understanding about my situation, and potentially do something about it?
 Any help will be appreciated.

 While learning I found that its not necessary to use phải and you can use không? When should I be using không versus phải không when learning Vietnamese when asking a question. 
 Examples:
 Lily muốn pho phai khong? Does Lily want noodles?
 Lily muốn pho khong? 
 Does the above still work?

 A year ago, I relocated to Vietnam to work in my dad’s company. I met this Vietnamese guy in the business meeting of my dad. Both of us are into each other. Although I look more like a Slavic person, I am always more attracted to Vietnamese people. He’s literally my type. I still have to travel between my mom’s country and Vietnam, and he’s busy, so we only see each other twice per month. Everytime we met, he still bought gifts for me. I also gave something back to him.
 I told him I consider buying a car , because I’ld settle down here in Hanoi. Then, two weeks later, a new Mercedes was sent to my apartment . Now, I have no idea how to buy something back to him. That Mercedes is worth over 2 billions VND. I don’t have billions to spend on a gift. 
 My dad always teaches me “never take anything for free in Vietnam”. I can’t ask my dad for much money though. We are just dating, and I am not his wife. It’s weird for me to receive a big gift like that. Luckily, I don’t live with my dad’s family. They haven’t know about this car yet.

 So I'm pretty stoked I get to go back to Vietnam I haven't been on an international flight since pre covid! 
 Last time I was there I injured myself and couldn't do the loop, however since I'm taking my girlfriend and it's her first time there the loop is my number 1 priority! Plus it'll be my 30th bday! 
 So my question is, where can I book that you'd recommend? She wants to use an easy rider I want to ride my own bike. I cant find any option to choose an easy rider or not online. So where can I do this? 
 Lastly what is needed for the loop? We have our health insurance that would cover leisure etc. Is there anything else? 
 Thanks in advance everyone!

 I am planning to take a 10 days trip to Vietnam
 plan is to visit like this:
 Hanoi - 1.5 days, Da Nang - 1 day, Hoi An - 2 days, Hue - 1 day, Phong Nha (cave trek) - 1 day, Ninh Binh - 2 days, Sapa - 2 days,
 Total : 11 days mostly 
 do you think this is a good plan ? 
 i have never travelled to Vietnam before
 what things i need to know before travelling to Vietnam ? 
 are there any other cities which i should choose instead of the ones i have chosen in my list?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if my question is phrased wrongly, but I do not know how to phrase it better. As a westerner (or in this case, a person born from Vietnamese parents, but raised in the US), I never really engaged with the Vietnamese language and many of its cultural products (other than the food, but that is a given). 
 I never really watch any Vietnamese shows or musics because it looked poorly made compared with other things, like American/Western sitcoms and anime. And looking at the posts on this subreddit, I see that the younger generation of Vietnam is also seem to take more interest in K-Pop, Anime, and other cultural media than their home media. So in that case, why should I take time to learn Vietnamese to engage with the media that even the younger generation seems to not take interest in? 
 I know this question sounds superficial (and it is) and there are many reasons to learn Vietnamese (talk to relatives and the people of Vietnam, learn the ethmology/history of the language, just have knowledge of Vietnamese under your belt, etc. ), but many times the reason why a person learns about a culture and the language of that culture is because they engage with something in the culture that sparks them to learn more about the culture. But I do not see that spark personally. Vietnamese is not the spoken language in the world (meaning it is not really a global business language), doesn't really have a huge art/film scene, and vietnamese culture in general does not really spark a huge influence across the globe. So why should I learn Vietnamese?

Are there any traditional royal and national symbols that Vietnam doesn't share with East Asia? Only Nghê and Lạc bird come to mind so far but they don't symbolize Vietnam as well as the dragon.
 Imagine if you are creating a new national flag or national emblem for Vietnam with more traditional elements, how do you make it so that it won't be confused with Chinese symbols?

 Main Worries: - Is there anything I’ve missed that I should include like Dalat or Hue? 
  
Is going to Ha Giang after Ninh Binh repetitive? We are planning to motorbike in both places, but I am debating cutting out the 3 day Ninh Binh leg as both might be too similar
  
Thanks! 
 Hanoi - 3 Days
 Ning Binh (including Tam Coc and Trang An) - 3 Days
 Ha Giang Loop - 3/4 days
 Da Nang and Hoi An - 4/5 Days
 Phong Nha Cave Trekking - 3 Days with Oxalis
 HCMC - 2 Days

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, my partner booked a flight to Singapore from Ho chi Minh and we are trying to change the flight dates a family member has fallen ill. 
 When we tried to change the dates this was not allowed on the website and we contacted costumer support. Unfortunately they told us we couldn't change the dates as we had "booked" our flights through an agency, which is not the case. We have an email confirming our booking through Vietnam airlines only. 
 They told us the name agency apparently being Aberdeen (with that being the only name they had) and that was it. We asked if they could forward us the confirmation they had on their side from such agency and they said they couldn't do that because it was with another department. We tried googling such agency and nothing comes up and again we don't have the confirmation from such agency either. We tried to argue we have not booked through an agency and again she refused to help us as she said we had booked through this so called agency that does not exist. 
 We are 100% sure we booked with Vietnam airlines and we don't know what to do now. We have contacted the other department she mentioned but there's only an email we could contact. 
 It feels like we are being scammed by the airline and not being helped. 
 Has anyone had this issue before?
 Update: We were able to change it through this new email we received. Someone in the comments mentioned there's an Aberdeen based Vietnam airlines which would make sense for why this happened. They are trying to charge us the equivalent of a new flight now though... So we are going to book with another airline. Good luck to whomever is having this issue in the future

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[em mình là con gái, tóc nó xoăn và phồng. Từ nhỏ đến lớn, có nhiều người kêu nó đi duỗi tóc. Nhưng gia đình mình vẫn yêu tóc đó của nó, thật lòng, nên nó cũng tin vào vẻ đẹp của chính mình như vậy.
 Nhưng đêm qua nó kể mình nghe, trong lòng nó vẫn chưa nguôi uất ức. Nó bị mấy thằng bạn chọc là chó lông xù, đừng chọc nó, nó cắn giờ.
 Mình hỏi rồi em làm thế nào, nó trả lời em im vì đáp trả là tụi nó chọc tới.
 Có ai bảo vệ em không? Không, mà có một lúc có đứa con gái định lên tiếng chọc nhưng có đứa khác ngăn lại.
 Xoã tóc - một hành động hết sức bình thường. Nhưng dưới tác động của bạo lực ngôn từ, hành động xoã tóc lại trở nên khó khăn với em mình hơn bao giờ hết. Nó không muốn xoã tóc đi học nữa, vì sợ bị bạn chọc. Cũng có lúc, từ việc yêu mái tóc xoăn xù tự nhiên, nó chán ghét và muốn duỗi thẳng tóc mình. Đó cũng là lí do em mình muốn lên chuyên, một môi trường khác vì “ở đó không ai nói, ko chê cũng ko khen mái tóc của em, nhưng ít nhất là không chê”. Cho nên em thoải mái xoã tóc khi đi ôn ở chuyên buổi chiều.
 --------
 Đặt bản thân chúng ta trong hoàn cảnh bị bắt nạt, nếu có người đứng lên vì mình, đứng về phía mình, bảo vệ mình, chúng ta sẽ ổn hơn nhiều đúng ko?
 mình hỏi em là mình đăng bài phốt tụi bạn lên fb được ko? em không chịu vì không muốn những người bắt nạt em đọc được. em muốn mình đăng nó lên insta để tìm sự đồng cảm, thấu hiểu từ bạn bè. tâm lý chung là vậy hay sao mn?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I am writing a Vietnamese character into my historical fiction story. It takes place in the 1920’s-40’s era and I’d love to get advice/opinions/resources for research on this character. I want her family to have moved to the USA when she was young (maybe around 12? She was born in 1892) But I’d love to know what kind of traditions the family might follow and bring with them to the states, what immigration was like at the time, etc. I know there were immigration rules in place at the time that might affect them and France was involved in colonialism in Vietnam at the time. I’ve had trouble finding any information on Vietnamese immigration to the USA before the war. I’d also like to be told about any history I should know that would affect this story, what people want me as a white writer to avoid when making a Vietnamese character, and what people want to see when it comes to Vietnamese women in fiction. So far I have her name as Chau Tahn Liên and I’ve named a few of her family members like her brothers, sister, parents, aunt and uncle, cousin, and paternal grandparents. I’d love to know if the name makes sense especially for the time or if i should make changes and what they should be. If you take the time to read and respond to this I want to say thank you in advance. I can explain more of her character to what people ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I’m travelling to Vietnam with friends on early february 2024. We’ll be staying in Sa Pa for 2 days (more or less), and we’re looking for a trekking route to do that is not crowded. In fact, we’re looking for a medium-hard trekking (we’re young and fit) where we’re not gonna be surrounded by tons of people. Is it possible to sleep in the mountain with a tent? Is it too cold or illegal? Thanks a lot!

She's been the best woman I've ever dated - but there is one thing that is getting in the way, and has suddenly become an issue. She has an aversion to splitting the bill. She has paid for dates before on a few occasions (in fact, she paid for our first one), but I would say it's 90-10 in terms of costs between her and I. I was told this was the norm in Vietnam for dating...but is it always? What about for long-term relationships or marriage?
 Recently, I broached the issue. We agreed to go to a restaurant, but I would meet her at her place before doing so (in the past, we have usually just met directly at the place or met at her's…]]></summary>

Which one would you choose and why?

 I've been there twice (to give it a a second chance) and both times I absolutely hated it.
 What's enjoyable about being packed like sardines in a can under a plastic cover while eating with sand flying everywhere?
 Why not eat and drink away from the sand and let people who actually use the beach have the space for some fun?
 Look at Da Nang, it's a much better experience, why is Vung Tau so different?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be traveling Vietnam for the first time next year as a Viet kieu (pretty fluent in Vietnamese). I will be there for 3 weeks with arrival in Saigon and departure in Hanoi.
 I’m open to feedback on my itinerary from all of you travel experts/expats/locals. I have zero expectation on following this itinerary 100% since I know that’s not feasible and unforeseen situations may arise. I like to have my days planned out so that I’m not scratching my head on what to do when I get there.
 I enjoy food as you can tell from the amount of food tours but also enjoy activities and nature/scenery. If you have any recommendations outside of what is on my itinerary, please share. All recommendations for attractions/restaurants/coffee shops/street food/shopping centers/markets would be appreciated. Also if you guys know of any pedestrian friendly/walking areas that are not on my itinerary, please let me know. I like to explore on foot but also know that Vietnam is not the most walk friendly country.
 Is 3 days too long for Ninh Binh? I like that cycling is a great option to explore the area but will I run out of things to do?
 Thanks in advance

 Our friends lives in the same Western country as we do. Which makes deciding the amount even harder. What would be a reasonable amount in Vietnam might be a low amount in our country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on holiday staying in a hotel and tonight found a cockroach in my bedroom, it's the first night in this hotel (in Hoi An).
 They gross me out, so I'm almost definitely overreacting but I just can't stand them.
 Anyway, I reported this to the reception and they said as it's rainy season (there has been heavy rain in the last few weeks) it's likely they've come up through the toilet/drain.
 Is this actually something that happens?
 They've offered to change our room in the morning to a higher floor, presumably with less chance of them coming up through the drains.
 Wondering if there is any point in doing this?
 I guess I'm really wondering if this is something the hotel can't help/has no power over or if I should be looking at this another way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Since I bought my plane ticket I’ve been lurking here a bit. My friend (45m) and I (40m) are coming to Vietnam from about Jan 1 to Jan 31. 
 Neither of us like planning much so right now I’m inclined to just book a hotel or air b and b for 7 days to start in HCMC and figure out the rest after we get there. 
 We will probably bounce over to Thailand for a few days, maybe Cambodia and Laos and I have to pop up to Hong Kong to see a friend for a few days. 
 Mostly we just want to explore and eat, maybe do some light hikes and we’ll probably both spend a decent amount of time alone. 
 Is it pretty easy to work stuff out after we get there?
 Also, kinda random but is Amex accepted pretty widely there? I have other cards, but I prefer to use that one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend recently obtained a Vietnamese passport in the United States for the first time as a Viet Kieu. 
 Now they need to travel to Vietnam to receive an "entry stamp" as proof of entering the country with their Vietnamese passport. 
 This is necessary for applying for temporary residence and eventually obtaining their CCCD/CMND. 
 The Vietnamese passport has been mailed to Vietnam and is currently in their possession. 
 They initially entered Vietnam using their American passport. 
 Now they are wondering about the next steps. 
 Should they exit Vietnam using their American passport, enter Cambodia using their Vietnamese passport, and then re-enter Vietnam with the Vietnamese passport?
 Alternatively, should they exit Vietnam with their American passport, enter Cambodia with the American passport, exit Cambodia with the American passport, and then enter Vietnam (via a border run) with the Vietnamese passport? 
 The situation is quite confusing, and any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just finished reading Viet Thanh Nguyen's "The Committed", and I was intrigued (and a little frightened) by this photo he had featured in the book. I still haven't found the photo's source after many Google searches and carefully looking through the book's acknowledgements. My only "lead" is Viet Thanh Nguyen mentioning certain people in his acknowledgements who helped him secure permission from the Union Générale des Vietnamiens de France to use the photo in his book. I really am curious as to what the story behind that photo is and would eventually like to learn more about the protests/rallies of the Vietnamese community in Paris.
 Any help would go a long way! (And perhaps help me sleep better since my curiosity's been keeping me up!)
 EDIT: From the man himself. Shoutout to u/Commercial_Ad707 for suggesting I reach out to Professor Nguyen!

 My Vietnamese is low right now, but I translated the words above the picture and it says something about learning. But, the Christian, flaming Bible seems weird in a public school. I asked my TA about it and she didn't have answers. 
 I know Christianity exists in Vietnam, there's a Catholic church very close to my apartment and I've seen Mormans about. However, I never expected to see this kind of thing here.
 Can anyone shed some light on what's up with this? Is this common? Is it meant to be Christian propaganda? Is the picture irrelevant? Is it even allowed in a public school? I'm confused.

I have read several articles in English and Vietnamese, and apparently, there were classes in South Vietnam until 1975. But I could not find detailed information on it.

 I believe this idea was inspired by the similar traffic law in the US, except we're forgetting one thing: Vietnamese doesn't understand the "right of way".
 This, together with the law of turning right on red were created to allow more efficiency for all drivers. But this works only if drivers are YIELDING for the opposing traffic, not crowding in the middle of opposing lane inching towards every space they see. The mentalities of giving the right of way & yielding obviously don't exist in Vietnam, so why implement it because it just makes things worse?
 We simply aren't ready for it, mentally and morally. Or worse, we won't admit it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm planning to travel to Vietnam during december 2023 - january 2024 for a three weeks period.
 During my travel, I want to explore the Mekong Delta region and cities such as Can Tho, Chau Doc, Long Xuyen, Ca Mau and Ha Tien during a three weeks period.
 I wonder if it's doable on a 50cc scooter (like a honda chaly or a similar scooter) or if it's preferable to do it on a bike. (I do a lot of bike and bikepacking in France so I'm pretty ok with that).
 I didn't have any driver licence so I can't rent a powerful motorbike, and I don't want to have any issues with the local police
 I'm also planning to stay in "homestay" like; guesthouses; etc
 So I had a few questions:
 -Can I find a long-term (3 weeks) for a 50cc scooter in Ho Chi Minh City or maybe buy one ? I wonder what's the best solution.
 -Did the road/dirt road are practicable on a 50cc scooter or a bike ?
 -Did you have any advice about the project ?
 I already look on internet, but I can't find so much infos on the Mekong Delta and backpacking it.
 Thanks all for your answers !
 Cheers

 The trip could be a disaster if it is confiscated from me! haha

I’m excited and nervous since our Vietnamese is at best to get our orders right at restaurants. I could use any helps or suggestions. So far, we have looked into inclusive tour package that will take us from HCM to Hanoi and all the cities in between. What are the best gifts to bring to Vietnam from America? What to avoid or to watch out for in Vietnam? I appreciate as many suggestions as possible. BTW, also my first time flying outside of America. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 I’m traveling to Vietnam in late November for about 11 days total. I’ll be spending 5 days in Hanoi and 6 days in HCMC. I’ve been to both cities previously, as well as Da Nang & Hue. So I’ve basically seen most of the touristy stuff there (including Ha Long Bay) and have decided to skip central VietNam entirely this time around.
 I’m thinking of making a side trip to Sapa while up north and potentially Da Lat or the Mekong delta while in HCMC. 
 Is two days in Sapa enough time to see most things there or should I add an extra day? Is Da Lat worth checking out for two days or so? How about the Mekong delta? I know both cities are pretty touristy and I can live with that. I just want to check out new places and get out of the hustle of the big cities. 
 Since I’ve done Hanoi and HCMC, I just plan on chilling, eating while there so my days spent in the smaller cities is flexible. 
 Also, I know the weather is hot/humid year round, but should I expect rain during this time of year?
 Thanks for any suggestions or recommendations!

 A couple of days ago we were put on the spot and invited to a wedding, of who I now know is my birth mothers half sisters daughter(I found out the relation a couple days ago). We were planning on leaving before but they really wanted us to come so we said we could stay till the wedding. The bride wants us to be part of the wedding party (bridesmaid/groomsmen). I had only met her once before this. It’s very kind of them to invite us. I’ve read other things on Reddit about wedding gift giving and if you’re family or friends.
 We weren’t expecting this event at all. 
 What should we expect and how much money should we give as a gift?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I studied abroad in America for four years. I completed my bachelor's degree in Marketing and Data Analytics in 2021, and I got a job in the US in 2022. I was on STEM OPT, and my employer was willing to sponsor my H1-B visa. 
 Things were looking up for a bit, and I thought I could settle in America. However, my health worsened in September 2022, and I was constantly sick every month. I got a serious case of vertigo that made me spend a day in the ER in August. And then, a month later I got diagnosed with H Pylori, a nasty stomach virus that could cause severe heartburn. In December 2022, I got Covid after attending happy hour with my coworkers. I had to deal with all of these along with anxiety and depression. In March 2023, I decided to quit my job and move back to Vietnam because I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't even apply for the STEM extension or participate in the H1-B lottery. 
 I moved to Saigon after coming back to Vietnam (I'm from Hanoi), but I still feel like a loser for coming back to Vietnam. When I set out to study in America, my goal was to get a job and a green card and then I would choose where to live. However, things didn't go as planned, and I am completely lost. I am scared of getting back into the corporate world because of what happened to me. I'm scared that my health will be in jeopardy again. I'm still looking and applying for jobs right now, but deep down I wish no one would hire me so that I could rest for a bit more. 
 Now I'm completely lost because the goal that I had been working towards for 5+ years was squashed, and now I have no goals or directions. If anyone could just slap me out of this confusing stage of life, please do.

We moved in a hotel in the tourist area for a month and almost every night at this outside Huda bar there was a white puppy sitting on a folding chair. He had a leash and tip jar next to him and I would always go up and pet him (I asked if I could pet him every time). And I fell in love with the little guy. So one day I went to the pet store near by and bought some puppy sized toys to give to him. When I saw the puppy again a few days later I patted him and gave him a rope toy to play with and we tugged it and all that cute stuff. I left him with the toy and saw the puppy about a week later without it. I never saw him since then. Is it bad here to gift a dog a toy? I had no bad intent or anything I just wanted to treat him. :(

 Do you know about 'pod chill' in Vietnam? I thought it was a regular vape given to me by someone, and after inhaling it 8-9 times, I collapsed. What is this? Is it synthetic weed? 
 I'm really worried 
 Are there people around who do this a lot(8-9times)? 
 I'm very concerned about possible brain damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in VN as foreigner. I know that vietnamese love karaoke and it's fine. Until they crank up the volume to absolutely outrageous level.
 I live in a very good place and very nice city, but unfortunately to me there are few villas nearby where drunk viet people like to sing karaoke almost every day up until midnight. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I understand they want to have fun. I understand they are drunk and don't care about other people.
 What I don't understand is why no one is doing anything about it? 20 drunk people affect thousands citizens who live nearby. Everyone is happy about noise? Can't believe it.
 Now the main part: there are four 5* star hotels near these villas. Classy, expensive, with good cars around it, etc et etc. Why management is doing nothing about drunkards in villas? It is so easy to call police. It is so easy to give them some money so they patrol this area a little more often. Submit complains, escalate problems to police superiors, even bribe if needed, etc etc. But why nothing? I live here for 6 months and problem doesn't go away. 
 I have so many questions.
 Hotel customers don't complain even when karaoke blasts at midnight? Hotel management doesnt care about anyone? Police doesnt care about 5* star hotels?
 Maybe vietnamese customers dont care about noise even if they rich because they are used to karaoke from their childhood. But what about foreign customers who live in 5* hotels? They don't complain too? I can hardly believe foreigners love this noise while they pay big sums of money for fancy hotel.
 Can some explain me this mystery?

I have zero reasons to visit let alone meet people I have never heard off and never talked. They are talking like they are forcing me too and it will not happen. 
 I do not know what ulterior motives they have for doing this and I do not want to be dragged around everywhere meeting relatives that I didn't even know existed. It looks like a beautiful place and all these family members sound really nice. 
 Food does sound good though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Sooo, I am a 26yo art student, viet born in western europe and would love to explore some contemporary art spaces and the creative wave that’s been happening and just learn about the people and the culture.
 The thing is that I visited last summer, the first time in 15 years and was with family most of the time. This was a beautiful experience but also, I was super annoyed with how paranoid my family was about me doing stuff alone. I always needed someone of my family to be there with me or someone they knew to escort me around for the most simple things like getting a juice around the corner. 
 The main thing they’re scared off is me being sold, kidnapped or deceived and drugged, because I’m recognizable as a Viet Kieu and am female. Sometimes I get mistaken for being fully foreigner, like Thai or Indonesian, cause I don’t look like the typical Viet when it comes to my style or my accent, or whatever reason they say I don’t look like a typical viet. (fam also say I’m too ‘hiện’ lol)
 The thing is, I just want to explore places, meet likeminded creatives and enjoy my culture outside of the family. But is it true that I’m not safe doing things on my own? Can I really not take Grab’s without the chance of being kidnapped? Can I really trust no one?
 My family be saying crazy stuff like ‘dont go on dates cause if you reject him, he’ll drug you’ or ‘white people have it easier in VN than Viet Kieu’ 🤡
 Anyway, thoughts? I just wanna explore new spaces and hang out with new people but how my family puts it; I’m in danger as a female not viet-born person doing things on my own.

 Generally I’m not a fan of those tourist trap kind of places, but the views from up there look incredible. It is also pretty damn expensive though.

 Not all the meetings I've had were with Korean people running shop here in Vietnam, but the meetings I've had with Koreans here have not been good to say the least. A lot of them seem to be the type of people you would explicitly avoid in Korea in terms of their mannerisms, approac…]]></summary>

 i understand that there are always good and bad people, especially in dating apps. but, if you're here for a beautiful girl that is willing to go with you to an alcoholic place on first date within 5 seconds of talking on the app, you deserve it.
 please, for the safety of yourself, try to find the red flags. sometimes they're very obvious, unless you're thinking with your reproductive organ.

Which she never took her, " she got better ". I haven't talked to the 1st cousin with the start up business over a year, but I do have her FB. The second cousin agreed she would pay me back this Tet when I visit VN. She usually call and ask how I'm doing and such but after the loan and I found out she didnt take her mom to the hospital , she kinda went MIA. I do have proof and receipt when I transfer the money. 
 Would it be rude of me if I just call them up out of nowhere to remind them that still owe me money? or should I just wait until I see them when I land and ask for it? 
 anybody has experiences of getting your money back from family members, let me know lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! My husband and I are visiting Vietnam this upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. We are planning a trip with my parents who live in Vietnam for 5 days during the 2 weeks before the holiday. My parents want to go from Quang Binh to Hoi An in 5 days. They want to visit Phong Nha Cave, Paradise Cave, Hoi An, Da Nang, and Hue. The plan is that we will land in Da Nang and travel with them immediately.
  
We will not use a tour agency so I am a little afraid of how many destinations they want to go to within such a small timeframe. Definitely, we will use public transportation to commute and that takes a lot of time to commute already. 
 The current itinerary: Quang Binh (1 day), Hue (1 day), Da Nang (1-2 day), and Hoi An (1 day)
 I hate jet lag and I want to take it slow to adjust to the local time when I first land. 
 We would like to enjoy the trip rather than move through each location super fast. We are considering tailoring in Hoi An for our wedding and it seems to not be doable with this iterary.
 I heard Hoi An is super crowded and 2 out of 5 days we plan to travel are weekends. 
 We love our parents but at the same time, we really want to visit Da Nang-Hoi An without rushing it.
  
Do you think this is a good idea? How can we commute between places if this trip is doable?
 I am gearing towards traveling to Ha Noi (3 days) and Halong Bay (cruise-2 days) so that we can experience the Northern vibe of the Tet holiday and enjoy more time on the trip.

 Preferably I am looking for full body massages or body scrubs. I’ve been to Vietnam already and been to the Miu Miu spa and liked the massage there but it was a female masseur and I didn’t feel so comfortable with that. I’ve also been to the Tarzan spa but that was more like a hidden brothel and the „massage“ was really bad. Definitely not looking for a happy ending thing. Looking for a proper massage!
 Price range should be around 500k. Would appreciate any serious tips maybe someone knows a good place.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helloo I am doing research on the avocado sector in Vietnam. Does anybody have some reliable sources about the history of the avocado industry in Vietnam or information about the (current) avocado production chain or any information at all about the avocado cultivation, the marketing behind it, human/workers rights, sustainable cultivation etc.
 Anything is welcome and helpful!
 I do this for a report for my minor in International Development Management, I do know how to search for sources, but I have done this for other projects as well and Reddit always surprises me with very helpful sources and information🤗
 I you are someone or know someone who works with or in the Vietnamese avocado chain who is willing to partake in an interview also please let me know! 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title says pretty much everything. I am a foreigner that opened a company in Vietnam. I hired an external company to help me out with accountancy/payroll. But they are an absolute disaster. The first accountant they assigned was a delinquent that made illegal movements in my bank account. And in the past 6 months I have had 6 different accountants assigned to me. All of them are late in filing the paperwork, I have to constantly chase them, and they hardly reply to emails.
 So does anyone know where to find a good accountant that can help with accountancy and payroll? If not in this forum, somewhere else? I am relatively new in Vietnam and I am not sure where else to look. Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went to Vietnam in June for a few weeks with my wife and daughter. We went to Ho Chi Minh City, Que Nhon, and Dalat. We decided to buy insurance from Berkshire Hathaway Travel protection. We chose the coverage that only covered medical emergencies. The price was less than 100$. Mid way through our trip my daughter became very sick fever ect. She had a bacteria infection which landed her in the hospital for anti-biotics when over the counter did not do the trick. We stayed at Vinmec got receipts for everything and ended up staying in the hospital for 7 days. The cost for everything came out to around 3,000. Vinmec gave us all receipts in English and Vietnamese. I opened a case with Berkshire while on Vietnam and they said I had a year to send all docs. When we got home I sent all receipts and charges from my credit card they also asked for bank statements and after 25 days I received a check for the full amount. They covered the hospital stay, medicine, emergency room visit too. It was my first experience with Berkshire but will use them in the future. I recommended this to my friend that also went recently and she also has to take her daughter to the hospital it wasn't expensive but it sounds like it was covered her bill was only 300$

Is this something common on Zalo? My partner thinks the app has been compromised and that our info might be compromised as well.

 I got a message from a badoo account “BlueSky” from a “girl” who claimed that they are single mom looking for relationship and works as sales manager at a BMW showroom. When I asked her Zalo, she said she will share only after meeting. I said let’s meet in person for coffee next day, I noticed she kept asking to send the meeting address almost every hour but I said I’ll send next day before the meeting time.
 Eventually I texted her the cafe address and was waiting. She said she’s lost and trying to find the cafe, I video called her several times but she declined. So I felt maybe it’s a prank and left the cafe.

 After exploring the country for a while, we would like to enjoy the beach and the sun before returning to -15°C and snow in Norway. After the beach we will go to HCM for NYE. 
 We have looked at Phu Quoc, but I am reading a lot about construction and trash here on Reddit. We don't have the budget to stay at a super fancy resort, but could pay to stay at the beach during the day. It seems like the island fits our preference in terms of weather, but I would love your opinion on the island in December in general. 
 Con Dao also seems interesting, if anyone has some input. 
 We are looking for: beach, sun, chilling (but also some activites). 
 I appreciate your help :)

 I’m heading to HCMC for five days next week. When I was there last year, I was turned away from several money changers in the D1 area, namely a couple in Saigon Centre when I approached them with USD100 bills. They were more than happy to take my Singapore dollars though. Can’t quite remember what their explanations were (because I was getting quite frustrated and worked up then) so I thought I would check in here before I bring along USD on me again on this trip. Can I use Revolut/Youtrip in HCMC?

My partner and I are currently in Nha Trang and I was about to buy some fruits from a market. I chose 2 apples and a kaki fruit, the owner said it cost 190k, which I think is a lot (same fruits would cost me only about 50k in my home country), so I offered 50k instead, which they refused after a bit of back and forth. My partner said to go, it's a scam but I feel bad/unsure. I know as tourists we usually get offered higher prices but I'm wondering if there is maybe something "special" about these fruits that make them expensive. What do you pay for these or would pay maximum for fruits like apples? Was this a scam or..? Thank you very much :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone else encounter extremely rude native Korean tourists? We’ve been going to Korean dense cities & I’ve noticed they’re very rude. And I know they’re Korean because I can hear them speak it.
 **I’m not saying it’s only native Koreans, but most of my interactions have been this way. I never experience this with Korean Americans back home, rich or middle class, so that’s why I’m so culture shocked by this behavior!
 Examples:
 Usually people move aside or try to avoid hitting the other person when walking opposite directions on a sidewalk.
  
I’ve been very harshly shoved by the shoulders or arms by Korean tourists who don’t even attempt to avoid me even when I try to avoid them. They’ll walk in a straight line, unwaivering, & will shove me hard then keep walking straight without looking back at who they hit. This has happened on multiple occasions where they can easily avoid hitting me as I try to avoid them.
  
Waiting
  
When waiting in line, I’ll just have a random Korean person shove their way in front of me as if I don’t exist. Same thing if I’m looking at something, but I’m standing to the side to allow others to walk by. 
 They’ll stand close & right in front of the displays, blocking me even though it’s clear I’m looking & trying to grab something.
  
Seats
  
At busy buffets, they’ll deny you sitting at the end of their empty table & far away by saying it’s full. Meanwhile, it’s empty the entire time we’re there. 
  
I haven’t experienced that with British, American, or Uzbek tourists at all. It’s literally just native Koreans. It’s driving me nuts! ESPECIALLY being hit & shoved! Teens don’t really do it, children I get, mid-20’s-60’s+ do it without care.

I’ve heard that people used to do Vietnamese family name, English name, Vietnamese name. That way the child basically has two first names and can choose which one to use based on where they are. 
 Then I saw there was a new law that said they can only have an English family name. This makes no sense to me because no one in Vietnam would know how to pronounce my last name, and no one in America would call a child by their last name. 
 Are there other options? Can we register the baby’s name with the US first and then with Vietnam to force them to accept a different name?

 I have a question regarding Names in Vietnam and how to address the person properly when writing Mails, Letters etc. 
 The name is Ho Thi Kieu Phuong. So far I figured out that Ho is the Family Name and Thi is middle name addressing the gender. So should I be writing "Dear Thi Kieu Phuong" or just "Dear Kieu Phuong" or any other variation of those names? 
 Bonus Question would be about the Meaning of the Name. Unfortunately I don't know the Name in vietnamese alphabet, but hope it's still solvable. 
 I appreciate any help with it!

 Ill start: I know one of the English teachers recalling his story. He was teaching about holidays and used White day (valentines) as a example. One of the students then asked if White day is like Black History month but for white people?💀

She's very classy and everything seems great except she chews with her mouth open. And not a little, a lot. We had lunch yesterday and she didn't even try to keep it closed, and talked a lot with food in there. If I were to mention this to her, she might consider it losing face and would probably ghost me.
 How can I get a nice lady to chew with her mouth closed?

My wife can drive for a year with an IDP but eventually we plan to get a driver license for both of us. I am Vietnamese and my wife is not but she can communicate in Vietnamese decently.
 For me, I know absolutely nothing about driving a car (or about a car itself). I also want to learn to drive decently and safely and we will not bribe. What can we do to prepare ahead? I heard there are some test apps online, does it make sense for me to learn them first before actually get to class? TIA.

 I'm heading to VN in a few months, I will be in Danang, Hoi An day trip, Hanoi, Cantho, and Sgn. I'm looking buy a couple of items from VN, but i would prefer not going to the market w/aggressivve vendors and negotiation hazzels.
 Here are items I like to buy: pepper, banh trang, coffee beans, dry bamboo (mang kho), and any squid and dry shrimp, I believe these are acceptable items for US. 
 Do you have a reiablie vendor recommendation? Or if you have any other recommendation to bring back to US, I muchly appreciated.
 Also - is it safe to use CC in Grab? I have friends that pay cash instead of paying cc thru app. I hate carrying cash :)
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I carry this with me for quite a while already: 
 I live in Vietnam, and a friend of mine, around 30, from a European country, told me in 2021 already the he need to get to Saigon to his embassy to get a new passport. Quite difficult during Covid, he also doesn’t have big cash to pay for the trip, so he kept on delaying it, until his passport ran out of validity. 
 In early 2023 he made the trip to Saigon finally by taking the train, told me he can’t fly because no passport, so Train best option. When he came back from that trip a couple days later I asked him about passport and if he got his, he told me not yet, embassy have problems bla bla bla. 
 Since then, he told me like three times on different occasions that he moved into a new place under his girlfriends name and kinda hides from immigration and doesn’t really care. If that’s true, we talking about a looooong overstay. 
 So my question: 
 1.) I feel he‘s telling me BS, but why would make shit like that up. What’s the intention??
 2.) Assume he‘s telling the truth, what „problems“ could his embassy make to not give him a new passport?
 3.) Could he really „hide“ from VN police and just overstay months without them seeking for him / finding him? What’s the play here, they actively looking for him or just waiting and hope they catch him one day? He‘s not really „quiet“ about his situation so I know the circle of people Knowing is not small either and I just can’t imagine they not knowing and not caring and not finding.
 This whole story is so damn stupid and I can’t make sense of it. Really looking to hear some fresh opinions on that.
 Edit: Could be he meant „consulate“ instead, I know a lot of people use the word „embassy“ but actually meaning „consulate“, so that’s not the big issue here. 
 Edit 2: Thanks for the replies guys!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How strict is Vietnam with "putting yourself out there"?
 In Indonesia, you can technically be deported for pretty much anything
  
Looking for a roommate, e. g. making a social media post is illegal
 Being a guest speaker at an event, even if non-paid for a volunteer-based organization
 Performing music, poetry, or doing a comedy skit at some bar/open mic can be considered illegal 
 Even having a YouTube channel that makes no money is theoretically deportable
 Meeting business owners to ask them about business collaborations (just hypothetical ones)
  
So, Indonesia is very strict. Will all of these scenarios always get enforced? No. You probably won't get deported if you perform some music at an open mic. But it's technically possible.
 How is it here in Vietnam?
 I'm in the meeting business owners boat. Ironically, I flew here to Vietnam because it's just very hard to open a business in Indonesia while you're in the country, so I thought I'd do it remotely. But now I end up seriously liking it here. It's more foreigner-friendly here, at least from my first impressions. 
 I'm thinking about talking to some businesses about my business ideas for their feedback/thoughts on the ideas. How strict is Vietnam with "advertising yourself"/"putting yourself out there"? I wouldn't be making any money, this is just to validate if I could try something out, at which point I guess I'd have to open a business, or fly out and do something via a German business.
 Thoughts?

I am still in the car ride with about 2h to go and not sure when/if he is gonna ask for money and what is correct? 800k for tolls sounds to high and like he tries to scam me. Is the passenger supposed to pay for tolls on Grab? Anyway what should I do?
 EDIT: Arrived at the hotel and he was demanding extra money for the ride, lucky the there were lots of hotel staff around as I wouldn't have felt safe otherwise. He even followed us to the lobby trying again and again asking to be added as tip etc. I rated the ride 1 star and write a report to grab about it. thanks for the help if I wouldn't have gotten such great replies he probably would have gotten money from me as I wasn't sure and I would have pitied him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t know how common this is, but this happened to me just yesterday after living here for about 7 years.
 So I was at an ATM pulling out cash, when I was done there was a man behind me and asked me to help him get his money out of his card. My first thought was that he’s trying to scam me or some other trick, who the hell asks a random stranger to pull money out of their card for them? I looked at him and he looks a little rough, probably a laborer from his clothes and calloused hands, and maybe an ethnic minority as well. He also looked honest and sincere so I thought fuck it, why not. He gave me his card, so I showed him step by step instructions on how to use an ATM, including the part where I told him to put in his PIN in secret and he blurbed out load to me 666666, I was just like bruh 😳. Anyways, we finished it up and he thanked me profusely, then left. I was just standing there dumbfounded that this dude would put so much trust in me regarding his personal finances, someone could have definitely taken advantage of him.
 Would you say this is a weird incident or is this more common than I thought?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like in English, I always think it’s strange to not have two separate words for “chúng tôi“ and “chúng ta” (“we” can include or exclude the person listening).
 Or in French, the counting system is infamously odd.
 It’s not about right or wrong, or which language is better. It’s about finding interesting things that native speakers might not notice.
 So what are some things you find peculiar, or confusing, or things that don’t make any sense to you in Vietnamese?
 Edit: I find the topic has been shifted to "what do you find difficult in Vietnamese" haha. Can we have more answers about some words or phrases or language features you find odd please? actually both directions are welcome, feel free to share

 What's the name of this Vietnamese song? - YouTube 
 Another thing I can remember was that this song was sung by a guy, dancing on stage together with a girl and the performance involved dancing in front of a giant projector curtain and sometimes walk behind it, as if they're "entering" the screen world and switching back to the real world basically. Hope that makes sense

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey reddit,
 My neighbor across the street runs a restaurant. Usually theyre nice and all, no problem. The problem are the guests and staffs that keeps parking their bike IN FRONT of our gate which prevent our vehicles from moving in or out. This happened on many occasion despite many times we remind them. Is there a way we can resolve this permanently? I thought of calling local police and ask if they want a free bike but i doubt theyd do much. Destroying the bike would definitely get things more complicated.
 What would yall do?

 Thousands of years ago, during the reign of King Kinh Dương Vương, the Xích Quỷ kingdom was an unknown stretch of a vast land on the far East, leaning its back on a range of high mountains while looking out facing the oceans from a long shoreline. He married princess Long Nữ, the daughter of Động Đình Vương - sovereign of the Động Đình Lake. They were then blessed with one child, a boy whom they called Sung Lam, popularly known in the kingdom as Lạc Long Quân, the "Dragon Lord of Lạc”. Because of Long Nữ’s origin, their son was believed to be a descendant from the line of the Dragons. And indeed, Lạc Long Quân had extraordinary strength and supreme intelligence.

 Perhaps it looks an stupid question, but we are a couple planning to go to VN the second half of Nov, and we are roach-phobic. We've seen many post here and there talking about this thing there: it is a south east Asia country, and face cockroaches is likely inevitable. Would you consider not travelling because of this? 
 We are searching for higher end hotels in Hanoi, Ninh Bihn and Hoi An because of this, but even the best rated ones in Booking (e.g. 9,1 - 1,3k reviews) can have a comment of cockroach found. Again, it might sound stupid, but we found cockroaches in the past and completely ruined our trips. What are your thoughts and experiences? thanks a lot

 Also how does it differ from Valentine's Day & International Women's Day?

 Despite being British, I actually grew up in Vietnam, from when I was 9 to 18. I left in 2012 and haven’t been back since - so I’m extremely excited to come back home! :) I’m sure I’ll be shocked at how much has changed! It’s also my girlfriend’s first time in the country. 
 We’re going to be spending Christmas in HCMC (where I grew up), and before that well be in Hoi An. I’m wondering where we can go after for 1.5 weeks of relax. We want a nice beach destination with some beautiful properties, activities, maybe some historical sites, nice restaurants, and somewhere to celebrate the new year! 
 When I was growing up, my parents and I would take quick weekend trips from HCMC to Mui Ne/Vung Tau for the beach, but I’m not sure these are the best options. 
 We heard mixed reviews about Phu Quoc, but everyone is suggesting Da Nang! What do you all recommend? Keeping in mind it’s end of December/January. 
 Any place in particular? Would appreciate ANY help! :)) 
 Cam on!

I literally booked my flight and did an emergency VOA 4 days prior to entering the country. Thankfully all went well and before I knew it I found myself wandering the streets of Hanoi being absolutely amazed by everything I saw. 
 What I did: 
 The first few days I rented a motorbike to get around the city which to me counts as one of the most dangerous yet funnest things I've ever done abroad. The traffic is chaotic and danger imposing at almost all times yet it still flows and creates amazing experiences, given you know how to handle a motorbike + stress situations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I teach a brand new elective class at my American middle school this year and I need some help finding a craft or art project for our section on Vietnam. The class is a little bit cultural awareness, a little bit foods, a little bit history. We did two weeks learning about Mexican culture, foods, holidays, and that section ended with the kids building a piñata. 
 For the Vietnamese section, I want to have a similar format so I’d like to end on some sort of craft or art project that is authentic. Some of my students are Vietnamese so I really want to get this right (I’d want to get it right regardless but I feel a little more pressure lol).
 Any ideas? For reference I’m teaching mostly 7th and 8th graders (12/13 years old). Any ideas or input would be super appreciated!

 So my Vietnamese ex-girlfriend saids that guy should always apologize first regardless if they're right or wrong. Especially in an argument. He would always need to "nhường nhịn" her. I know that my ex was not the only one with this idea, because I saw TikTok have a lot of posts about this. But most Western culture would say that communication is key and both side would need to find a middle ground to talk and apologize to each other
 In a breakup, my ex wants me to "dỗ dành" and "níu kéo" her. But Western culture would say go no contact and severe any contact. 
 I don't think there's a right or wrong, it's just a matter of difference in culture (I guess).

A taxi driver approached us with a pic of us when we were arriving (we were walking into the gate). Our actual driver texted me at that moment, so i assume this was some trick, but it felt kind of eerie. 
 Moral of the story: make sure you know what your driver looks like! We confirmed with our hotel that this was not the guy. Might seem straightforward but we almost fell for it. Maybe someone else will use this as a cautionary tale :)

 So I lived in Vn for a few years and I absolutely love the place. 
 I'm looking at coming back to do business now my country has signed a free trade deal with Vietnam. 
 Some friends and I have been trying to contact various places to establish contact with experts in several fields, and we find more often than not that emails on official websites are either unmonitered or they bounce back as inactive addresses. 
 Now I know that business in Vietnam is very much a face-to-face kind of thing, but we're trying to establish some form of rapport before we come over for a expeditionary visit. 
 How do people on the ground deal with this? 
 Are phone calls and not email the primary means of making initial contact with people?
 I'd appreciate some advice for making contacts in Vietnam before we travel there. 
 Thanks!

 I'm traveling to VN in January and will be there until June or so. I plan to stay in 3-5 cities for about 1-2 months at a time with weekend getaways other times. What do you recommend I travel with? I'm debating between a large rolling suitcase or buying a 30L-ish travel backpack. 
 I intend to use Grab for getting around and maybe splurging to rent a car for traveling longer distance? I'm not sure and could use some guidance. I welcome any clarifying questions. Thank you!

My friend matched a cute vietnamese girl on tinder and she said „let’s go eat somewhere“. So far so good. She said she knew a good restaurant in the are, north of Hoan Kiem Lake. As we are 2 guys travelling around my friend asked her to bring a friend. We went out on a date with them and everything seemed to be fine.

 Having just spent 5 days in Da Nang - largely stuck in my hotel room due to torrential rain - I had the bright idea to travel to my next destination (Hoi An) by walking the entire length of the 25km beach on the Da Nang’s east coast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Growing up in America and living in both the Midwest and California, I always thought pho is the most popular dish to Vietnamese since there are way more pho restaurants than any other types. 
 After arriving here in ho chi minh city, I realize that may not be true. I only see a pho place for every 50 com tam, hu tieu place.
 Is it because pho is more appealing to non vietnamese folks? My observation is just in the ho chi minh city region so far, not sure about other regions.

Then, I'll transfer money to this account and withdraw it as needed on my trip rather than carry a bunch of cash with me.
 I will be staying in Hanoi if that makes a difference. Thank you

Many popular spots, some less popular ones like coffee plantations and some temples. But I am planning to stay in Saigon and Hanoi each for an extended period to immerse myself, meet locals, and learn about the ways lives are lived there. (What other reason is there to travel?) I am wondering if anyone has any useful insights for extended stay in these cities, or even suggestions of other cities or towns which would have much to offer for an immersive stay. For extra context I am a writer, a historian (primarily of race and racism in the United States but with interests far beyond that as well) generally interested in social hierarchies and looking to also learn about the realities of Vietnamese socialism/socialist-oriented capitalism.

 Because that is when this unique board game convention takes place!
 Though board games have been a part of Vietnam's past time for a while, with traditional games like cờ tướng (Chinese chess) or ô ăn quan (Square Capturing), mordern board games are relatively new to the mass audience. As such, there have not been many big events dedicated to this awesome hobby.
 Started out as a local event for tabletop gamers, we are bringing back Board Game Fest for the 3rd time, this time on a scale bigger than ever before. With 150 game tables, hundred of board games and several dozen of Game Master and staff, we hope this will be a welcoming event for everyone, young and old, Vietnamese and foreigners alike. There will be many booths with all the big board game coffees in Hanoi, leading board game publishers from Vietnam where you can experience their games/ services. Whether you are new to board game and want to try out some amazing-looking games; or want to check out some of our never-before-seen self-published titles; or just want to hang out and potentially meet someone who shares your interest, there is something for you at our event.
 The event venue will be at TH School - yes that's the beautiful pink building right on Chua Boc street. Book your tickets now to enjoy the best deal (we are only selling tickets to provide a big nice venue for the event). Details in the poster below!
 If you're anyway interested and have further question, feel free to reach me via PM or via our FB page. Our team want make this a meaningful annual event and help grow the tabletop community, so I really hope you will consider joining our tables, and hope we will have a great time together!!

Đôi khi tôi còn thấy chính những nhân viên bán xăng ra ngồi quầy. Có thể thấy rằng hành vi này thực sự xấu, nó nguy hiểm khi người dân thi nhau tàng trữ chất gây cháy nổ và không hề có biện pháp phòng ngừa, nó thực sự gây hoang mang cho tôi, cảm tưởng như rằng chúng ta sắp hết sạch xăng và không có gì để dùng khi đó việc kinh doanh như vậy sẽ đem lại nhiều lợi nhuận. Mong tình trạng này sớm được giải quyết và thu nhỏ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My landlord has various altars around the house. They all have an array of flashing multicolour lights that are on 24/7. 
 The small altar downstairs at the entrance of the house is particularly annoying, because it's always in the corner of my eye. My bedroom door is glass so I can see the lights flashing all the time when I go to bed at night. 
 What is the purpose of the lights? Is it really important they always be on? I'm wondering if it would be a big deal if I turned off the lights at night, and just made sure to turn them on again when my landlord comes to pray. As far as I know it's the money altar, it's not the main ancestral altar, that one is upstairs.
 Edit: thanks for the feedback, I won't interfere with the altar

 Im traveling and recently had a guide tell me that the average person in Vietnam does not pay taxes unless they work for the government. He didn’t really seem willing to explain further than that, so we didn’t ask. Is it true that most people don’t pay taxes in Vietnam? 
 If so, how are infrastructure projects funded and who pays government employees salaries? I don’t mean to sound ignorant, just genuinely curious. Thank you!

 Cheapest iPhone 15 listed: $799
 Average monthly salary in VN: $733
 iOS Market Share in VN: 40%
 Average monthly salary in Singapore: $6,324
 iOS Market Share in Singapore: 34%
 Average monthly salary in Malaysia: $1,485
 iOS Market Share in Malaysia: 33%
 An intern of mine bought an iPhone 15 for 4x her monthly salary, and is willing to finance it through a 12 months installment. This obsession is pretty fascinating to me, so local peeps please weigh in. But here's my 2 cent: if you need to finance a mobile phone, then you're not financially capable of owning it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you love zombie movies you have given some thoughts on what happens if something like a zombie apocalypse happens in Vietnam.
 My thoughts are Mekong Delta region would be swarmed with hordes of zombies and would be really dangerous to live. Crowed Cities like HCMC or Hanoi would be totally infected in just a couple of days considering the population density.
 Vietnamese dont have guns. So people would be defenseless. Its dangerous to engage zombies in a melee combat. Except groups of ex militants. But zombies are not good as traversing hard terrain. And Vietnam is full of such terrain,85% of territory is mountain so if you just go and make a settlement in a sloppy area. You should be safe. Except for anomalies.
 Best thing i can think of to do is go to high altitude area. A really high place.I would like move to North West or Tay Nguyen regions. Fansipan is a good choice.The Mainly hunting or can even cultivate if you have some offensive weapons to take dons a couple of zombies that might appear. My choice is live on the top of terraced fields so you never worry about food.Vietnam would be among the safest places against zombie. If you have some resources to sustain your self in remote hard terrain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From my perspective as a 23 year old, I support innovation in education. Professor Ho Ngoc Dai, as a prominent figure in education reforming who had gone through the hard times in Vietnam, even consider children like a friend, once said "if you consider them like a friend, then you can't scold them". Unfortunately, majority of people in Vietnam and even ppl of my age still support this way of "education", like wtf how can you say you beat them because you "care" about them, which is total hypocrisy. And then the "backthen we got beaten and that gave us success" mentality, which is totally survivorship bias because those people only got like good job with average income, maybe higher because backthen there were more opportunities due to booming economy in early 90s and 2000s. And if the method works then why is corruption and crime is still rampant in the country? 
 Of course this is a cultural issue, and I'm sure that many people may be triggered and even compare to the US or something. And yes, Vietnam is no doubt a part of sinosphere where collectivism and conservatism is widespread, people don't change much and clings to Confucian values much like the way Islamists clings to orthodox view. So what is your thoughts ? Do you support change ?

 The name is different enough that it doesn't violate any copyrights/trademarks, while the recipes are recipes I created myself, apparently there is no copyright on recipes? I'm told that there is nothing that can legally be done about it.
 So, is there anything legal that can be done about it?

 According to my guide book (Le Routard), plenty of excursions should be on offer in all the travel agencies to the several traditional hand craft villages around Hanoi. However, speaking to multiple of these agencies today, it appears most of them don't even know what I'm talking about... Closest I got was a half day scooter tour to Bat Trang. I can find some info online, but also on here it's rarely mentioned. 
 What I was looking/hoping for was a day-tour where you get to visit 3to4 of these villages and can experience/whitness the different craftsman in action.
 Is this maybe not a thing anymore? Is the info in my guide outdated? Has anyone on here ever visited (some of) these villages and was it worth it? Which ones would you recommend?
 Thanks! Grts from Hanoi 👋

 I’d like to know from you! 
 Do you drink tap water in Vietnam? If so, where do you get it from? Do you advise travelers to drink tap water in remote regions of Vietnam? 
 (For clarity, I have no problem buying water but I like to get honest opinions from locals and other seasoned travelers, and not the copy and paste blog posts of todays computer travelers). Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in Saigon just a couple of weeks and my lungs feel like they're on fire. 
 Walking down the street, the fumes from the thousands of motorbikes zooming by actually make me nauseous and I have to hold my breath while walking. I can even smell them from inside my apartment. I was planning to take a job here, but don't think I can since this is such a big deal for me and affects my physical and mental health. (I also love walking, and this city is probably level 99 difficulty for pedestrians) 
 The noise pollution is pretty bad and I can't sleep. There are bikes outside with loudspeakers blaring the same line over and over. I've stayed in four different apartments and every single one has had loud construction noise from 6am-10pm, every day. Even on Sunday. I was once woke up by hammering noise from inside another apartment at 2am! It seems inescapable. I noticed my ears are ringing when inside when it's silent. Everything is so loud here. 
 That's manageabke though. The worst for me is the air. Although it's pretty good in general compared to hanoi, the traffic just overrides that. 
 When is the metro expected to be built? My daily transportation spending was lower in Singapore than in Saigon 🙁
 Is there any area with low traffic and good air quality? Has anyone else felt the bad effects of pollution since moving here?

 My wife’s never rode a bike before and is a little bit sceptical about doing the loop however advised she’d do it if it was on a quad.
 She doesn’t want to do it with another rider and I don’t want to do it on a bike with her on the back of me as i think I’d enjoy it more myself on a bike.
 And we would prefer a group rather than self hiring.

 Obviously asking people in the r/Vietnam subreddit won't get nearly correct answers as people here tend to be more influenced by Western English media but despite that I'm curious at least what the userbase here think/what they see in the country.
 Mainly I want to know it is because I am a Marxist and uphold countries like Vietnam because of how well they progressed and despite Doi Moi I see it as an effect of proletarian power. My country itself was heavily progressing from awful living conditions during socialism but unfortunately we had system change.
 TL;DR: How do you/the average Vietnamese feel about socialism (if there even is in Vietnam after Doi Moi) and Marxist theory?

If anyone has any questions, please give me a shout-out.
 Here are some notes:
  
Vietnamese open mics are often quite restraint and polite, there are a lot of shy wanna be singers, but it’s just a glorified stripped down acoustic karaoke session with pianos and acoustic guitars, so unless you bring your own stuff, it’s mostly just that to show your singing and instrumentalist skills
 Western open mics are quite fun, exuberant and chaotic due to the presence of a stage for electric instrum…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Vietnamese friend based in Ho Chi Minh has been undergoing some life and financial challenges lately. I don't speak Vietnamese and my doesn't speak English, so most of the time I use Google Translate to carry out a conversation. Whenever my friend feels down and out, she always says "tôi chán quá", which translates to "I'm so bored" in English. Did she really mean bored or should I take it as she feels depressed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a rather confusing encounter in Ho Chi Minh awhile back. I was walking around Ben Thanh market at around 0900hrs and went to stop at a store, I normally would say Hi or Xin Chao and proceed to ask the price of the item. 
 I noticed the sellers will ask how many item do you want to buy first instead of the price tag. I then ask again how much is it, she said something along the line “Morning price, first customer you don’t say that to me, I sell to you, how many do you want to buy?” 
 Since she didn’t answer my question, I told her I will come back and walk off. 
 Was I rude? Is there a cultural thing or is it rude to ask how much are the price of items here? 😅

 do you have any tips for differentiating what to call people as to not seem rude or offend them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 New account due to privacy reasons.
 I cannot wrap my head around VNese housing market. Used to live in Hanoi, HCM and Danang. Currently scouting Danang properties. Seen maybe over 100 various land/houses options within 5-20B range. And it just throws me away, as I cannot see any logic, behind pricing strategy.
 For example, I've came across several options such as 180sqm land cost 7B, and then 2 parallel streets further - 12B or so. In comparison, neighbourhood is the same, surrounding space/layout was similar too.
 The market seems very saturated. Tons of listings for bigger land (150sqm+). With huge price fluctuation (35M/sqm - 70M/sqm).
 My question is, how does one can buy any of this? With current mortgage rates (12-15% after excluding first few years) it's a money burn going that route. Further, if I understand correctly, VNmese are not very encouraged to take this route, since rates most of the time we're high (~6%), compared with West (1-2%).
 I can only see smaller properties to be in a hot market (3-5B), as it's easier to deal via loans/mortgages, but going further, especially 8B+ route - it becomes a madness.
 Given the market in HCM, I'd see that there is no stop in price increase. I can feel now that it's more of a stagnation period. I'd like to believe, that prices would come down, but at the same time - I feel that greed will be the driver for prices fueling up. However, question appears - how long can this last?
 What I guess, VNese take 7-9% fixed mortgage for 2 years, buy something and try to flip it. Is there any other way, they are able to afford and buy lands/houses for that much?
 What keeps me up at night is that there is just so many listings in Danang, prices seems to be inflated and yet, sellers aren't willing to go much lower. However buyers market is definitely not here as well (for at least 8B+ listings).
 Would love to hear your experience and thoughts while navigating this market!

 To me, there’s just no place like it. The Viet Bac, the Tay Bac, these places are so alive with culture and the scenery is stunning. 
 There isn’t always as much tourist infrastructure, but if you can ride a motorbike then get on it and go.
 October/November is a wonderful time to travel here. Avoid the rainy seasons due to very real risks of landslides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, looking for some guidance here. I'll be brief, explain a little about what direction I'm heading and my conditions on the ground in Hanoi. Me and my SO have extensive experiences in production/manufacturing/import/export and marketing. We both have business development skills and a high work ethic/drive. So in that sense we have our bases covered. I have been to Vietnam a few times and I have fallen in love with Hanoi. It feels as f the universe is pulling us here. Europe is going down the drain (I currently live in Sweden) and the US is in an even worse spot. I used to live in New York and LA and I never want to return. Thats our background. 
 Idea. Import/Export/Manufacturing either textiles or beauty. Thats the plan at least. I don't think I have enough funds to venture …]]></summary>

Is it rainy season in all of Vietnam or less in one area? I am from Florida so this I’m pretty used to. Is it raining all day or is it an hour then done for the day like here? Also is there any other areas to visit while in those bigger cities?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🇬🇧 EN Hi all, 
 As the title says, can I have some travel advice by someone in Da Nang or who has travelled in Da Nang today (since the Level 4 Disaster flood warning was issued today [for the first time in history apparently.]).
 We have a train into Da Nang tomorrow and a flight out of Da Nang two days after.
 We are wondering whether we need to make changes to our plans, or whether taking the risk to go is an okay decision.
 🇻🇳 VN Chào mọi người 
 Như tiêu đề đã nói, tôi có thể có một số lời khuyên du lịch của một người nào đó ở Đà Nẵng hoặc người đã đi du lịch ở Đà Nẵng ngày hôm nay (kể từ khi cảnh báo lũ lụt thiên tai cấp 4 được ban hành hôm nay [rõ ràng là lần đầu tiên trong lịch sử.]). 
 Chúng tôi có một chuyến tàu đến Đà Nẵng vào ngày mai và một chuyến bay ra khỏi Đà Nẵng hai ngày sau đó. 
 Chúng tôi đang tự hỏi liệu chúng tôi có cần thay đổi kế hoạch của mình hay không, hoặc liệu chấp nhận rủi ro để đi là một quyết định ổn. 
 ———
 EDIT: We’ve called some sources who state that the train station is less affected than the airport. Would anyone be able to validate this?
 EDIT: Chúng tôi đã gọi cho một số nguồn nói rằng nhà ga xe lửa ít bị ảnh hưởng hơn sân bay. Có ai có thể xác nhận điều này không?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 My partner, toddler and I have so far spent time in Hanoi, Ninh Binh and Ha Long Bay. What an incredible country, we are having such a great time. We came knowing that it was the wet season but the day we got to Hue my partner came down with some sort of tummy bug... 
 We're taking it easy for a couple of days and keeping the kiddo as entertained as possible but I'm now feeling a little concerned regarding our plans to travel to Da Nang on the 15th. 
 We are getting the train in and our hotel is very close to the beach in the center most part. 
 Judging from the news stories of flooding I can't see how us turning up will be a good thing for ourselves, and the already struggling local services. 
 From a travel weary father of a toddler and partner of a sick girlfriend, please may I have some advice on how to proceed? 
 Our flight leaves from Ho Chi Minh on the evening of the 19th and we have a connecting flight from Da Nang that morning. 
 Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys 
 Before I came to Vietnam I heard a lot of people saying that people from Hanoi are unfriendly especially compared to the south.
 Now I’ve been in Vietnam for 2 years I’m living in Saigon but frequently go to Hanoi.
 Before I went to Hanoi the first time I was kinda worried that people are not as nice. But quite the contrary was the case.
 I had lots of great experiences in Hanoi and people were generally friendly.
 I often heard that people there are not smiling but I didn’t see that at all. When people see me they show me a peace sign ✌️ or wave and invite me for a cigarette or the tobacco bong or this self made alcohol ( I think it’s ginseng but idk for sure ) 
 Generally I found people very open towards me,maybe those bad experiences people talk about only happen in the city center?
 What I also find interesting is that people talk to me in full blown Vietnamese which I find refreshing. They don’t dumb down or change to English, they just talk and try to make me understand with sign language lol 😂.
 Everytime I’m in Hanoi I feel like my Vietnamese improves a lot.
 Anyways just wanted to share my experience in Hanoi.

 I'm planning to do major cities, Hanoi, Halong bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An, Dalat, HCMC. Originally I was planning to start north and go all the way down to the south and fly out of HCMC. 
 But now I'm having doubts that this is the best route, weather wise and public transportation wise is it better to start south and make my way to the north or vice versa? 
 Any other tips welcomed :)

 Is it because so many locals keep them in tiny cages and they just want to roam with the ladies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't ask this question on r/HistoryWhatIf or any alternate history channel because most of them have no idea of European history. 
 Vietnam is a nation that is well-known for being extremely good at fighting wars, managing to gain independence from a strong nation like China, defeating the Mongols, and expanding down from the Red River Delta to the Mekong Delta, destroying Champa and Cambodia in the process. They also defeated the French, Americans, and Chinese forces which threatened their independence in the 20th century and managed to overthrow the Khmer Rouge which were battle-hardened troops, or so many internet historians say. 
 However, during the 18th-19th centuries, there were many wars the Vietnamese had against the Siamese over the control of Laos and Cambodia. While both sides had their victories and losses, the Vietnamese won more conflicts than the Siamese, which is weird since Laos was controlled by the Siamese while Cambodia was jointly-controlled, meaning that the Siamese gained more land in the war. 
 In 1800, Siam had a population of 4 million while Vietnam had a population of 7 million, almost 2 times more. 
 Without European colonialism, would Vietnam had conquered Siam like how they conquered Champa and the Mekong Delta? Or was Siam too strong of a kingdom to conquer? 
 Many Thais don't know much about the Siamese-Vietnamese wars since it is skipped over in history classes. As I'm not a Vietnamese, I don't know whether these wars are taught much in Vietnamese schools but I'm sure Vietnamese people are more knowledgable in their histories than Thais are in theirs. So I decided to ask the question here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that most of the tourists coming to Vietnam, or SE Asia in general, just hop on a moped with little to no experience. Everyone tells me the same thing to just "find a quiet road, fuck around for 30 minutes and you'll be fine", but also these are the same people that end up hurting themselves or worse - someone else. 
 I don't want a lecture on being a dumb foreigner causing accidents on mopeds because we don't know how to ride them properly, I'm genuinely trying to ask what is a relatively ethical and normal way to learn to ride a moped here? How do you go from no prior experience to taking on the sea of bikes in the big city?
 Currently staying in Hanoi and feel a bit limited to using Grab to get everywhere, especially for the future when I would like to travel to more rural regions that don't have the same accessibility without a bike. I obviously don't want to learn in the traffic here but what would be a good place to go and "fuck around" without anyone going about? 
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I had a conversation with a Russian-Vietnamese (who was born in Russia). She was not okay with Vietnam staying neutral in the Ukraine - Russia war. While I really don't appreciate her point of view, I can see why. After all, she is Russian and she wants people to support Russia. I also have seen the opposite story, where pro-West Vietnamese condemn Vietnam for staying neutral.
 The conversation, unpleasant as it was, was quite interesting. Which do diaspora Vietnamese community care more about, the interests of their native country or the interests of Vietnam ?
 For example, let's say if Taiwan and China went to war, would you expect Vietnam to do something about it for the interest of Taiwan / China because you live in Taiwan / China ? Cause I really don't see the point of Vietnam picking a side.
 Whenever you vote for your leader in your country, do you pick them for the interests of Vietnam ? When Trump got elected, my friends studying in US were absolutely terrified, because they were afraid of him imposing strict laws on immigrants, and that was not a good thing for Vietnamese who tried to work and study over there.

But my ticket has been issued and it says 1 piece of luggage! This is totally weird for business class. (I am fine with the 32kg limit of checked baggage but I have two bags a 16kg and an 8kg bag.
 I have tried the US help line and it is just going to voice mail (even though it is within US hours.) is this normal? Any advice here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If so, why?
 There is too many upsides to getting a Vietnamese passport, and NOT enough downsides.
 - The visa situation will get more stringent over time. Look at what happened post-COVID. One day, you will NOT be allowed to do infinite border runs, even on your 5-year visa exemption. Pre-COVID, it was VERY easy to renew your tourist visa inside the country. Post-COVID, much harder. Look at Thailand ... they charge $24K USD for their 5-year tourist visa ("Thai elite visa")
 - Vietnam's GDP rising.
 - Opening a business is easier. You don't need a Vietnamese partner who owns 51% share of the company
 My prediction is, it will only get HARDER & harder to get a Vietnamese passport as Vietnam's GDP rises ... just look at Vietnam's visa policy -- it's already hard for non-ASEAN tourists to get a visa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apparently, Vietnamese pronouns are really hard for many learners, so I decided to make that one of the first things I'd tackle in the language. Correct me if my explanation is wrong.
 Vietnamese has a few pronouns, of course. The pronoun for I is fairly common, for instance. However, it seems like Vietnamese likes to avoid using true first and second person pronouns, like other Asian languages. However, that means you need some other way to distinguish yourself and different people in conversations.
 Vietnamese chooses age and gender. You imagine that this person is a part of your family and choose a pronoun for you and a pronoun for them that agrees. For example, I would call myself big brother if I'm talking to a little girl and call her little sibling, and she would do that in reverse.
 Here's a chart I made with all the different pronouns: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1WGMQL-_9XU14HV8i4OgvW0fiPY50n4OUcoNOS0q8U/edit?usp=sharing
 I honestly think it's a fascinating system. You get to show respect for the listener in more ways than tu/vous in French, but you also don't have to change the entire sentence, like you would in Korean.

I went check out this house this week and was shown around by this friendly vietnamese woman around my age in her 30s. There was a guy renovating the house who was also super friendly and chatty. I soon realized they were probably together despite the fact it was odd as he could pass as her dad. He's a local, not an immigrant. She has a kid too.
 So days go by when I haven't made up my mind so I send her a message asking if said room is still up for grabs. She says it's been taken. But then proceeds to send me a message saying One thing I want to say to you is you are really handsome and have such a beautiful smile. This followed by a cheerful/smiley emoji.
 Well, what the heck?
 Isn't this at best inappropriate considering she's likely with this other guy? Am I missing a cultural difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have a friend who is a foreigner and has lived in Vietnam for 4 years.
 He had a business visa before for teaching English in Vietnam for 1 year but quit the job and now working remotely for a foreign company. So he is living on an investor TRC & visa. 4 years ago, he had to renew his tourist visa once or twice by leaving Vietnam to Cambodia then entering Vietnam again.
 He now has trouble entering Vietnam as his entry date was on the old expired passport and he is holding his new passport. So at the Cambodia - Vietnam border, they didn't issue him the new visa for Vietnam. He went home, brought his old passport over and still they didn't issue him the visa because they couldn't find the stamp for his TRC on his passport. (what does this mean please help me explain this)
 He has to go to the HCM Immigration office for help. Now I have some questions:
 - Can a foreigner live in VN forever with just tourist visa? How many time can one leave and enter Vietnam on tourist visa? Can he do this for the rest of his life?
 - Can someone work remotely for a foreign country but want to live in Vietnam? What kind of paperwork he needs to be able to get a residence permit here?
 - How long an investor TRC last? Can one keep using his investor visa/TRC for multiple entries in Vietnam?
 - Can someone be a criminal (maybe not wanted) in their country or other country and can enter Vietnam without being recognized?
 - Can one commit a crime in the past and be able to apply for a job in Vietnam?
 - What kind of job can grant one a work permit? Does it have to be a full-time job?
 Is there any other possibility around this case where one won't be able to find a job in Vietnam, or not plan to but want to live in Vietnam? Is there any issue could hold one back from getting a job in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My business is doing really well and I am expected to come into a significant payout. I am a Vietnamese-Aussie who doesn't have a family. 
 My question is what business would you start if you have enough funds and your in-depth knowledge of the Vietnamese market. 
 I'm not fishing for answers only, I want to start a discussion on Vietnam's economy and her next stages and how Viet Kieu or even just general foreign investment can help accelerate that process. 
 Examining the market it's saturated with restaurants and cafes at all levels. I was initially looking into starting a steak restaurant at the 3-4 star range because of my contacts in my home country. But it seems so risky to try and capture that market. A lot of cost into renovations etc. 
 I really want to bring money back into the country in an beneficial way for myself too don't get me wrong. I guess maybe people more knowledgeable than I can answer, thanks.

Coming from the US, it's pretty unheard of anyone learning Pascal, especially in a middle school or high school setting. I'd imagine Java or Python would be more standard. I can probably guess that computer science education is not as advanced or well funded in other countries, so that is maybe the reason for using an older language.
 Also I came across this old post, not sure if it is still relevant or not

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’m traveling to Vietnam for 5 weeks at the beginning of November. I am unsure of what to do for payment. I have a Wells Fargo Visa debit card and CitiBank MasterCard credit card; I am from the USA. I know most tourists pay in cash in Vietnam, but I am worried that my debit card won’t work at ATMs to withdraw cash. Unfortunately, I probably don’t have time to open a new debit card. 
 In addition, I am not sure of how to book through apps like Booking.com, Hostelworld, Grab, 12go, etc. Grab doesn’t seem to accept my USA visa debit card. I have been able to book a couple hostels with my US card but unsure if it will work once I land in Vietnam. 
 I predict I will spend $1-1.2k USD, but obviously don’t want to just carry that much cash to be converted to VND all at once. Maybe I will take $200 cash.
 Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My partner and I will be traveling Vietnam next month (November 12th to 26th) for 15 days. I am thinking of exploring Hanoi, areas in the North, and not going any further south than perhaps Hoi An. We don’t want to rush too much so would prefer to stick to 3 to 4 places. I have some questions that I would appreciate some help with:
  
Ha Giang: We would really love to do the loop on our own but are not experienced on motorbikes so can’t really make that happen. We aren’t into guided tours so wondering if there is an alternative way to enjoy Ha Giang without doing the loop. Trekking perhaps? We are experienced overnight trekkers and like big days such as 10-15 miles per day hiking. Is trekking a good alternative to motorbiking the loop in Ha Giang? If so, can we do this on our own or would we need a trekking guide? To add, we aren’t against hiring a private guide for certain things, especially if it allows us to learn more about the area, just aren’t into big group tours.
 Ninh Binh or Mai Chau: My partner gets sick on boats and we also don’t really like overrun places so considering skipping Ha Long Bay. Would you perhaps recommend Ninh Binh or Mai Chau as an alternative for a few days? If you could only go to one, which would it be?
 Phong Nha Ke Bang: I would really like to go here but I know November is the rainy season there. Is it still worth trying to go? Can you do trekking or some of the caves without a guide or are guides required? I was planning on not going further south than Hoi An but should we perhaps try to skip some of central Vietnam and try to see somewhere drier such as Dalat?
 These are the places I would like to see but won’t have time for everything. What would you recommend removing/adding? We enjoy physical activities such as trekking, cycling, nature, sleepy towns, good food, the ability to explore by bike.
 
  
Hanoi
 Ha Giang
 Mai Chau
 Ninh Binh
 Phong Nha Ke Bang
 Hoi An
 Dalat
 
 Thanks so much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anglish is a thought experiment about what English would sound like if it had no loanwords from Latin, Greek, French, etc. Some examples are Uncleftish Beholding ("Atomic Theory" - all the scientific words which are borrowings from Latin/Greek are directly translated into English), and the Anglish Moot (an Anglish Wikipedia, basically).
 I'm intrigued (as a Vietnamese person) what Vietnamese would look like if we were to do something similar - no Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary, no French and English loanwords. Expressing scientific/modern concepts (and many everyday concepts as well - such as time; "thời gian/时间") without Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary would be very challenging, IMO - probably because Chinese has been influencing Vietnamese longer ago, and for a longer time, than Latin/Greek/French/Old Norse have been influencing English.
 From "Uncleftish Beholding", which calls an electron a "bernstonebit" (a calque of "electron", which comes from the Greek for "amber", "amber" being a loanword from Arabic by way of Old French), perhaps an electron could be "chớp con" (a calque of Chinese 电子; Sino-Vietnamese reading điện tử). Maybe a computer could be "óc chớp" (calque of Chinese 电脑). (Tính - all senses - is a Sino-Vietnamese word)
 Just to clarify: this is only a thought experiment by someone interested in languages.

Nma hiện giờ gia đình tôi không ổn lắm, đang trên bờ vực li dị. Vì bố tôi hay đi uống, nhậu nhẹt về có lời lẽ quá đáng và xô xát với mẹ tôi.mẹ tôi không thích điều này nên hay cãi và lớn tiếng mỉa mai. Tất cả nguyên nhân của cuộc cãi vã là mẹ tôi cho "bạn " mượn 70 triệu không qua giấy tờ từ 8 năm trước đến bây giờ vẫn không trả đồng nào trong khi gia đình tôi hiện đang khó khăn vì chị tôi vừa lên đại học và cần nhiều thứ để chi. Và mẹ tôi còn mượn họ hàng tiền có kèm lãi, vòng tròn thiếu tiền =>mượn nợ=>trã tiền+lãi=> thiếu tiền xoay vòng liên tục khiến nhà tôi khó khăn hơn. Bố tôi cực kì bất mãn về việc này nên khi say hay dùng việc này để sỉ vã mẹ tôi. Khiến mẹ tôi không chịu nổi và muốn li dị, hiện tại đã viết giấy và chỉ cần ký và nộp toà là gia đình tôi đổ bể. Tôi đang đứng trước vấn đề muôn thuở của đề tài này " con chọn theo ai?" Thật sự thì tôi chả muốn họ li dị hay chọn theo ai cả, giờ tôi chả biết làm thế nào. Xin mọi người cho tôi một lời khuyên

 Been to various locations around Vietnam and the world, but I have never experienced such a high concentration of rudeness, in-politeness and general unprofessional behaviour than I have in Da Lat, second to Paris, of course.
 I've read many people here complain about the behaviour of locals (yet choose to stay), in my experience barely 1 in 50 interactions have been negative. Yet, in Da Lat, this was flipped where barely 1 in 5 interactions were pleasant. This included drivers at Langbiang (a massive tourist trap, but anyway) literally running to their Jeeps and quickly driving away when asked for assistance, attendants being more pushy to payment than I've experienced elsewhere, rude staff, attendants etc., incredibly dangerous and aggressive motorcycle drivers, and shop attendants promising to help with postal/online orders than ignoring messages or giving one word replies to detailed questions (messaged in vietnamese) when followed up with. Along with your usual long stares from locals, attempted rots at tourist traps etc.
 Before people jump the gun with "what do you expect in Vietnam/tourist place/being a forigner etc." I'm used to people in cities with lots of tourism being rude or just tired of the people who's income they rely on (Paris and Kyoto are notable examples), but what I experienced here was far beyond anything I have in other parts of Vietnam such as Da Nang, Hanoi or even HCMC.
 Is this something locals and other travellers have found? Do Da Lat people have a reputation for their attitude in Vietnam or did I just have several one-off experiences?
 Oh, sorry I forgot to start the post with "I love Vietnam, its people, its culture etc. but....", its implied

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnamese source here, and you can pretty much find the latest info about this greedy coach everywhere recently.
 A quick brief for those who don't know Vietnamese:
  
Vietnamese young athletes of the national table tennis team informed the public about how bad their daily meals were, and a big investigation was carried out 
 apparently they were supposed to have a 8-person dinner which cost was around 800,000vnđ (~32 US dollar), but none of the provided images about the meal proved such thing (fried tofus, boiled veggies, etc), and apparently all of them was being heavily under-fed 
 things turned out that a huge part of their provided money from the sport department was kept by the coaches
  
Latest news shows that the head coach explains that he's just keeping the money because some athletes have been scammed before by online deals, therefore he would be keeping all the money and return it to them at the end of the year.
 These greedy men are now fired.

 “I tell them,” Giap replied, “that the French went back to France and the Americans to America. But the Jews have nowhere to go. You will not expel them.”

Definitely don’t think all of them are, just seen it happen so much in the 8 days i’ve been here. It’s almost as if the they believe that everyone is here to serve them. Chinese people I’ve met in Australia are generally well mannered, so completely baffled to why they are like this here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am flying with Vietjet Airlines from Mumbai to Hanoi, and my bag measures 62 x 32 x 24 cm, which exceeds the specified dimensions of 56 x 36 x 23 cm on the Vietjet website. Although I've purchased a 2kg add-on for weight, I'm uncertain if they will also check my bag's dimensions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm planning my first international trip in January and I want to take Jan 1-16 to see the world solo.
 I was contemplating between Vietnam + Thailand or Vietnam + Taiwan (Thailand would be more conveniently distanced, but I think Taiwan is more interesting). 
 Not sure if it matters but I plan on spending 3 weeks in China come May. 
 What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always book through a tour guide but this time I wanted to book myself since I'm seem to be a lot cheaper. We're planning to go to Hanoi, Halong Bay (Cruise) and Ninh Binh and had a few questions for people who have booked these trips themselves before.
  
Is it easy to book a transfer through the hotel? We would need a transfer from Hanoi to Halong Bay and then from there to Ninh Binh.
 What area should I stay in Ninh Binh?
 For tours do all hotels in Ninh Binh offer tours that you can book day of?
  
Thanks!
