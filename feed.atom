        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I only got to spend a week there, and I did a lot of typical tourist activities. I'm American, but I actually went on vacation visiting from China back in 2019. I had been living in Beijing for a year. Beijing is a tier 1 Chinese city, but the vibe is... depressing. People generally look unhappy and stoic, similar to Soviet style culture I suppose. Chinese are inoffensive in customer service, but just... cold. When I landed in Hanoi, which is supposedly the conservative part of Vietnam, the difference was night and day. Interactions with hotel workers, restaurant workers etc was warm and welcoming. English was spoken widely, which again is total opposite of Beijing. What struck me the most was the energy. You could "feel" the progress in the air, like it was an up place where the best is yet to come. I heard China had a similar vibe in the early 2000s. Contrast with China now tho, which by 2019 had already apexed and was showing clear signs of decline. I stayed at a Hilton in the center of Hanoi and it was buzzing with business travelers. Clearly it's a growing hub of activity. I also did a junk boat trip in ha long bay, and the guy on the boat was talking about how better life has gotten in just the last 5 years. From the warm locals, to the food (tho I'll be honest Hanoi food wasn't that great, but the street food was fun and cheap... heard HCM is the place to go for food), the vibe in the air, Vietnam stole my heart and I can't wait to return. I've been to well over a dozen countries and lived in 4 continents. I would absolutely love to spend a year or two in Vietnam as it rapidly transforms and grows it's presence on the global stage. I wish you all success, I know life isn't easy for all, but as someone who's "been around the block", Vietnam is special. Keep doing what you do.

 I read online that Red-shanked doucs can be seen on the Son Tra peninsula. Is it only place where I can see them or is there some better place? On the Son Tra peninsula, do I need to take tour guide or can I just walk/drive around. Are there some good spots or hiking trails where to watch them?
 I couldn't find much information regarding Gibbons. I know about the gibbon treks in Cat Tien but I read mixed reviews about it. Is there some better place where to see them?(preferably in central/ south Vietnam)
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically I work in a restaurant in Hanoi, whenever a customer take a seat, I'll ask them how many people they go with, is it one or two
 I noticed a thing that with middle age customers, like 40 years old and above, when they answered "Một", a lot of them always aspirated the T, like how you say the sound T in English IPA with a burst of air. Like "Một-tuh" 
 Which is weird because as also a Vietnamese, also living in the North, next to Hanoi only 10km, I personally have rarely ever heard any one pronounced words that way. If I say "Một", I don't aspirate the T, only stop it and hold the T behind my front teeth. It doesn't come out ever with a burst of air.
 The only person I could recall also talking like that is a coworker of mine whom I used to work with a long time ago. I forgot where he came from but just not a Hanoian and also came from the North, and he always pronounce T in words like that, aspirating with a burst of air. "Biết rồi", for example, it's like "Biết-tuh rồi"
 Is this common way of pronouncing words with T?

 Hi everyone, today I'm going to Prague and I know that there is many Vietnamese people in Czech Republic but I don't know how to order in a restaurant. Is it like in the food stall in street in Vietnam? like just say hai Bún bò or maybe you have to follow the local way to do? If so, I don't really know how to do in Vietnamese. Also if you happen to know a good Vietnamese restaurant in Prague, let me know :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Nanban Trade era between 16th-17th century Japan had a great interest in trading with some Southeast Asian locations due to the Ming attitude toward the sea (the Wokou pirate was a huge issue back then) and the bad relationship between Japan and China during this period.
 However, I checked on the wikipedia and found out Japanese merchants tend to arrive to Dang Trong more than Dang Ngoai for trading even though Japanese merchant ships during this period could extend really far and wide within the Southeast Asian region.
 Was there any major factors behind this?

They are now an adult and want to get a college degree to unlock more job opportunities. What are their options? Is a High School diploma required for university in Vietnam? Will they need to go back and complete every grade after 5 before they are eligible for university, or is there an equivalent to GEDs in America where they can test out of it? What resources are available for a person in this situation?
 How much time and money should they expect this process to require if they decide to pursue it?

 When the war between Russia and Ukraine started, I had to move out. As a remote worker I lived in different countries, but Vietnam is my favourite so I live here already about a year (by visa runs). 
 I really like this country, but my Vietnamese is pretty poor, since I know only about few hundred simple words and phrases. Basic verbs, pronouns, nouns, numbers e.t.c. I planning to stay in Vietnam at least until the end of the war on my homeland. So should I go study Vietnamese courses or something like that? Or it's not worth trying since I don't work here, and still don't have any at least a bit close Vietnamese friends? 
 Maybe it's enough just to continue learning passively?

 I hope everyone is having amazing day so far. So long story short, me and my family with a 2 year old daughter will be visiting Vietnam in October. 
 We thought about the idea of going from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh city and visiting other cities on the cost. I’ve read a lot that it’s not recommended to rent a car and drive without a driver since the roads are dangerous. That said, I would like to know if everyone has done any similar trip with a car,buss or a train( couldn’t find this option). 
 We are thinking to spend around 2 weeks going this route hence why the car idea would be the best without a driver. 
 I would highly appreciate anyone experiences and or any tips how to travel to get the most out of the country.
 Moreover, I’m a professional driver/racer and been driving in a very dangerous places before. Thanks everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a 19 year old tourist from The Netherlands, in Vietnam. I'm here on a 30-day tourist visa that ends on October 5th.
 I have been struggling with mental health issues. I quit my marketing job back home and wanted a break to travel, so I booked flights to Vietnam to be here for roughly a month. I arrived in Hanoi on the 6th of this month, and I'm still here.
 I'm enjoying your country. I'm considering to stay, if it is possible.
 Is it?
 I would want/need to get a job. My talent is marketing (specifically English/Dutch content and SEO), and I speak English fluently, my accent however is bad.
 Besides that, I would of course need the needed documentation, like a work visa. I would need housing as well.
 Is this idea feasible or should I stop thinking about it? I just need some honest feedback from someone who knows how this kind of stuff works. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I will be travelling through Vietnam soon, it will be my second time. 
 I have never driven a motorcycle before, and first time just took grab moto taxis. This time though I am with my girlfriend and so would maybe be interested in using a bike, sometimes, instead of taking separate trips or cars. 
 When in HCMC, we have walking distance all we need, and I would not want to use a bike here anyway. 
 But in a place like Da Lat, or maybe Đà Nẵng, or Huế, I wonder if all things considered it would be a good idea. 
  
I do not want any problems with the police, so I am wondering worst case scenario what is the biggest issue we could have, a fine? Or worse? How likely is a stop anyway, I have been in Asia a lot and always see foreigners riding bikes, some with helmets (as we would) and some without (foolish) and never seen anyone have an issue. But I have heard online of issues. 
 How safe would it even be? I will avoid one hundred percent HCMC/Hanoi, but in quieter places will it be better?
 Realistically how hard is it to drive the bikes? I have ridden quads before, and also bicycles (I’d that’s relevant) 
  
It’s just likely that renting a bike in places like da làt to go see some more far away places would be ideal and cost effective. 
 If it is not a good idea though, we will just have to figure out another plan.

 I’ve been living in the US for 15 years after moving from Vietnam in my teenage years. I thought I assimilated myself pretty well: high school athlete, joined a frat in college, got a mid level management job and just recently got married to my college sweetheart. 
 Everything seems to be going well on paper but living in the suburb in a huge metropolis really starts to take a toll on me: the cost of living is insane, our combined income is well into the upper middle class in our area but it barely feels enough. Walking around downtown seeing all these people living in their high rise apartments and having boats right on the shore makes me feel tiny and insignificant. It’s humbling to put it lightly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm teaching in public schools. It's a nightmare. They are so uninterested. They have no respect. Their behavior is truly shocking. 
 I give the rules, like a stuck record before every class. I write them each time on the board. I've been nice, tried to reason with them. I've been a completed troll. I've enforced punishments, like making them stand for the duration of the lesson (now we have been told we are not to punish in anyway as learning English is just an 'extra' class, not important).
 I've explained that their behavior is unacceptable, and when someone is speaking you listen. Especially a teacher. Right after explaining they turn right around to the person behind them, and start talking or playing Uno.
 Then there is the fighting in class. Last week two boys had a full on punch up in the classroom over who got the answer right. 
 The other day I walked into a classroom, and a boy looked at me and said 'what the fuck is this?' 
 It's a fight from beginning to end. How do you cope?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Soviet Invade Afghanistan, what was Vietnam reaction, and what news did Vietnam hear from the Soviet Afghan war.
 I hear this a lot how that Soviet Afghan War is the Soviet version of the Amercian Vietnam War. Would you say it a good comparison. While the outcomes are super different because one country (Vietnam) is now stable and very good economy, while the other (Afghanistan) is now being ruled by a radical religion group that terrorize its own citizens. 
 However, both countries commit the worst war crimes in though wars, which cause a lot of political backlashed from the international community and their allies:
 USA in Vietnam: Phoenix Program, Tiger Force, Agent Orange, My Lai massacre, Thạnh Mỹ massacre, Thủy Bồ incident, Rape during the Vietnam War, Incident on Hill 192, Sơn Thắng massacre, Operation Speedy Express, Côn Đảo Prison, Phú Quốc Prison, List of bombing campaigns of the Vietnam War, 1963 South Vietnamese coup d'état, Gulf of Tonkin incident Lie, Operation Barrel Roll, 1970 Cambodian coup d'état,
 Causalities: 1,326,494–3,447,494 dead (some sources even claim 5 million people died) 
 Soviet Union: Tajbeg Palace assault, Laghman massacre, Padkhwab-e Shana massacre, Baraki Barak massacre, Kulchabat, Bala Karz and Mushkizi massacre, Kunduz massacre, 1980 student protests in Kabul, Rauzdi massacre, 3 Hoot uprising, Report Soviet troops raped Afghan women, 4 SOVIET DESERTERS TELL OF CRUEL AFGHANISTAN WAR, Chemical Warfare (Moscow's Poison War), agriculture destruction (The War In Afghanistan: Soviet Strategy and The State of the Resistance), KHAD, 
 Here a very good video: How The Afghans Defeated The Soviet Union
 Causalities: 562,000–2,000,000 killed (Some sources even claim up to 3 million) 
 with 5 million externally displaced and 2 million internally displaced which make around that Approximately 6.5% to 11.5% of Afghanistan lose it population to the soviets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for Vietnamese-speaking local guide (English NOT required) I speak Vietnamese semi-fluently and can 100% understand Vietnamese when spoken with a southern accent (I struggle a bit more with Northern and Hue accents but can probably manage. I can read very poorly but could get by if it was a life or death situation). What would be a good way to find a local guide who can dedicate 2-4 weeks to showing me around the entire country? 
 I feel this would be a good opportunity for a recent grad who wants to practice English (with someone who is fluent in both English and Vietnamese) and to go on a free vacation (with modest base pay ~$500USD for one month and basic essentials like food, lodging, etc.) covered. I would also prefer it if they are a woman (because I am female and would feel more comfortable with another woman) who knows how to drive a car/motorbike and who has experience traveling in VN. Am I being unreasonable/ too demanding?
 If it isn't clear, I am asking here because I feel most of the options I see are group tours geared towards tourists who have 0 understanding of Vietnamese language and culture and rely purely on English-speaking guides and tours. I don't really want to do these tours because they seem waay overpriced and limit what you can see or do based on availability of English-speakers. They also seem to cater to a western audience and I am not interested in that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 26yo, and I recently visited Vietnam for the 2nd year in a row and this time for 4 months (3 visa runs). I'm now back in my home country and I'm really interested in living in Vietnam long term. I've looked at the visa options and job opportunities and I don't have a degree so the visa option I'm most interested in is the Investor Visa, invest 130k usd into an existing business in Vietnam or I can open a franchise like 7/11, GS25, Family Mart etc. I would not have to run it but it would be an Absentee Owner business, which I've read is very common in Vietnam and then I could get a 1 year Investor visa which can be renewed 5 times (5 years). It would be something for 2-3 years from now, so I can increase my income potential to be able to have the capital to be a foreign investor.

Never straightforward and honest. 4. Always the last person to find out anything even when it’s been planned for weeks, you will get told on the day or the day before or not Al all.

 That guy has such bossy attitude and acts like the manager, he is younger but act like he is more experienced and like my all years of experience is nothing.
 We had a Hanoi-an lady work with us too, seemed not friendly or helpful at all. I thought maybe its a female thing.
 Lately i have noticed Hanoians have some major issue with southern and expats. He has the mindset hanoi team is far better , i mean fuck you bro, i taught you soo much as mentor and you act like this.
 I am even an year older than him, i always thought VN respect elders
 I told the guy to F-off, as an expat remote female employee i was very shocked and hurt by his behavior.
 Strange jealousy or acting like no one is better than him.
 So are Northern very cold towards expats? Its my bad luck, i met the wrong one 😔 😭

 I started a small food business just recently and even as a foreigner of Chinese descent (not buddhist or taoist though), I feel some Vietnamese people seem to take superstitions quite seriously, some of which is trying to say if something “unlucky” happens, it is a good sign for something lucky to come.
 Some examples: 1. Hitting the table or something metallic hardly - will bring in customers 2. Accidentally breaking glass - good sign for attracting customers 3. Raining on opening day (especially if it’s right after you done opening day prayers) - business will flourish
 What are some others you have heard?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got into a scuffle the other day with a guard demanding 20k VND tip for supposedly "guarding" my car.
 Just a quick run through, I parked my car in front of an abandoned empty lot on a quiet Sunday morning and had this guard running from the opposite street (not even opposite, more like a few shops down from directly opposite my car), trying to squeeze in a "service" of opening my car door for me. This same dude then demanded 20K VND as "tip" or "fee" for helping me guard my car. I of course said no because I didn't think he deserved it or that he actually owned that spot. He then proceeded to knock heavily on my window and shouted "I watched your car for you, so the fee is 20k!" - Translated by my Vietnamese girlfriend.
 Keep in mind that I'm not a fan of tipping , and if I must, I believe a tip should be reserved for those who actually deserve it, not a random guy sitting by the corner of the street insisting that he did me a service, like I can't open my own car door. Do you guys think this expectation has been terribly manifested by the tipping culture from overseas, and has now deemed as appropriate? or am I just a bad person? Also, not sure why bikes aren't subjected to tips but only cars? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I’m an American currently on a long term travel adventure and I’ve been bouncing all around Europe for a couple of months. I’m planning to head to Vietnam for the first time in a few weeks and I’m looking for a place where I can chill out for a while and truly get to know the culture and people.
 My research has pointed me at Hoi An, but I know it’s quite touristy. That’s ok, as long as I can see some culture as well.
 Some thoughts about what I’m looking for:
  
Smaller city or town is preferred. I’ve been in the massive cities in Europe and I’m ready for a slower pace for a while.
 I speak absolutely no Vietnamese. I have no qualms about using google translate, but I want to visit a place where that wouldn’t be viewed as a negative thing. In other words, someplace tourist friendly, even if it isn’t touristy.
 I tend to love seeing museums and historical sites when I travel, so someplace where at least some of that is available.
 I’m not a digital nomad, but decent internet so I can keep in touch with family and friends would be nice.
 Near a beach, even for day trips would be cool, but in no way a requirement.
  
Any suggestions? Is someplace like Hoi An/Da Nang my best option?
 I appreciate any help or tips!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am of Vietnamese origin but I have been living abroad in Europe. I am currently in Vietnam for three weeks visiting my relatives. 
 The richer part of my family living in Vietnam really wants me to move back to Vietnam and tries to find all ways possible to persuade me, one of the being the rapid improvement of life and presence of many money-making opportunities thanks to the growing economy. 
 It is true that in the last year or two I have ocassionally seen and heard some news about Vietnam's rapid development and its increasing direct foreign investment from other countries. The successful relatives really talk nice about the local life and how much better it is from Europe. They have showed me some of the nice places for richer people (I guess only really expensive for locals but affordable for foreigners). 
 Visiting Vietnam I have also seen myself that there has been improvement in Vietnamese infrastructure and services for example. However, I cannot really judge the real situation based on a three-week holiday, neither can I fully rely on my relative's point of view since they don't have the full knowledge of Europe either and their opinions might be biased.
 I need to have an objective perspective to compare it since I am biased too. How does a real life look like in Vietnam for a (upper) middle class? How would you rate your curent situation, would you move abroad if you could? How good are the international opportunities? As local, what are the things you like and dislike about the Vietnam compared to other countries?

 According to one of my cousins who has went through middle and highschool though, it is said that they fight… alot. Is this true? and just how brutal are these fights? Like is it just one on one wrestling or full blown gang brawls? I want numbers so I’ll just put a poll up

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào! I apologize that I'm not fluent in Vietnamese, so this post will mainly be in English.
 My mother was born and raised in Vietnam, but immigrated to the US and had me there.
 Today we saw a praying mantis, and my mother talked about how when she grew up in Vietnam, the older people in her town would chew betel nut and put the paste on praying mantises. She mentioned the reasoning behind this practice as that the older people think the praying mantis likes it too.
 This was very surprising and confusing for me, and I tried searching in Google (in English) about this custom. I can find plenty of sources about betel nut chewing in Vietnam, but nothing in particular about putting the paste on praying mantises.
 I don't think my mother was joking when she mentioned this, but I just want to hear some verification from other Vietnamese people about this custom. For additional context, she grew up in Phan Rang in Ninh Thuận.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve lived in Hanoi for over a year now, I’m going back to England for Christmas this time. I’d like to surprise my loved ones with gifts from Vietnam, what gifts would you recommend? It would be best if they are easily portable, good value and quality, targeted at either gender. Also, the whole point is that the gifts will be authentic and can only be found in Asia. 
 I’ve always struggled to think of Christmas gifts that are different and surprising. I know sometimes it’s best to just buy the more expensive option and call it a day. But I think this year I would like to give out multiple smaller gifts to bring a variety. I’ve got a few ideas but I’m wondering what other people would think of too. Thanks for all the help :))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm currently exploring the possibility of manufacturing silicone/tpe based products, and I was wondering if any of you might have some insights or recommendations. I want to emphasize that I'm looking for legitimate manufacturers.
 Here are some specific details about what I'm looking for:
  
Tooling: We plan to supply our own tooling, so manufacturers who can work with provided molds and specifications would be ideal. However, we're also open to exploring the costs of having tooling made in Vietnam if it makes economic sense.
 Manufacturing Location: While we're open to manufacturers outside Vietnam, we're particularly interested in understanding the manufacturing landscape within Vietnam itself. If you have knowledge about manufacturers in Vietnam or can recommend any reputable companies, please share your insights.
 Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Our initial requirement is a minimum order quantity of 400 units. If you know of manufacturers that can accommodate this quantity or provide competitive pricing at this scale, we'd greatly appreciate your suggestions.
 Packaging: We plan to handle the packaging ourselves, so manufacturers who can provide the product without packaging would be preferred.
  
Please keep in mind that this inquiry is for legitimate purposes, and I'm looking for advice on how to approach this inquiry in a responsible manner.
 Feel free to reply here or send me a private message if you prefer to share information privately. I can also explicitly share images of our products as well. I will also be asking you to provide examples of your work.
 Thank you in advance!
 Best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably controversial but f it. I’m (31F) solo traveling throughout Vietnam now. First I went to see family in HCM, then I began my solo journey to Hoi An and Da Nang. No issues in either place. but I’ve been in Hanoi since Saturday and walking around I’m noticing a lot of harassment from south Asian tourists . Yesterday I was in Ha Long Bay at the beach and this guy started taking photos of me. Then he came up to me and asked if he could take photos with me, I said no. Another tourist came banging on my hotel door last night on the cruise which scared the crap out of me. I told him to go away. Today I’m back in Hanoi just walking around in the old quarter and a group of them started to stare at me like I was prey. I quickly grabbed my dinner and went back to my hotel.
 I have no issues with south Asians, I have a lot of South Asian friends in the states and also work with them. They are the kindest people. They do not act like this. I just never experienced harassment from like this and it’s kind of bummer it’s happening IN Vietnam. I’m terrified to go out alone now and will probably being taking Grab everywhere for the duration of my stay even if it’s less than 10 minutes away

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was born and raised in Vietnam, moved to the states when I was 13. I’m now in my late 20s and have a full time remote job with good pay/benefits. I went back to vietnam about a week ago to attend my cousins weddings and have had so much fun. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m on vacation but I’ve seen Vietnamese people way more relax and not uptight like Americans. Breakfast and cafe in the morning will thousands of options, my cousin here in Vietnam is a freelance video editor and he works whenever and wherever he wants, around noon all the vendors close for a nap time, and at night eat out (again with thousands of options).
 Meanwhile, I work 9-5 in the states with 30mins lunch time but sometimes I eat at my desk. After work, I have to go to the grocery stores or the gym and sometimes too tired to even cook. Weekends I have to do chores and again grocery. It just feels like time is shorter in the states.
 Everything is getting more expensive in the states so my 75k a year salary doesn’t seem much. My fiancé is a teacher so her job is pretty demanding too. 
 I just feel like people in Vietnam just have more what we call ‘freedom’ the U.S has been advertising. I’ve been considering moving back to vietnam for the past few days if I can work remote and my fiancé can teach English but my parents have properties in the states and they have sacrificed so much so I can have the “best” life in America…just some thoughts
 Edit: just to clarify since some people are triggered because I use the word “freedom” what I meant is it just seem that the lifestyle and work style in Vietnam is more relax compared to America but I do understand that I’m here on vacation so people take off work to hang with me

 Then I walked around the corner and there was about 30 staff lined up on opposite sides of aisle.
 Then I had to walk through them.
 Then they all clapped and bowed
 Does this happen every morning ? Is it an opening morning thing ?

 However, when I booked a Grab ride with the discount, the driver mentioned that he didn’t realize it was a discounted ride and now he’ll receive less than he initially expected. He said that discounted rides means he gets paid less.
 So, how do payments work for discounted rides? I was under the assumption of the first scenario which was why I used offers in the first place.

 But my friends told me that it's illegal to use such a weak-engine bike to use on highways, that by law 50cc bikes are not allowed on them. And I'm pretty sure in order to get to Ha Long, I have to be one some highways. Is it illegal to use them on highways? 
 Or is it even possible to go that far with them, since my bike allows only to drive 50 km/h max. It might take long, and my bike might break down if driven at the maximum limit speed for long hours

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So! It's officially been one month since I moved to Vietnam from America. So far, I'm really liking the country- even though I know I have plenty of room to grow and get to know it better. Given this, I wanted to ask some more trivial questions and provide some general comments as an adjusting newcomer.
  
Are measuring cups in cooking not a thing here? None of the stores I've found that have kitchen appliances carry them- even the more specialized ones at Aeon Mall.
 Having witnessed the car-clogged streets of Manhattan, I find the constant flow of motorbikes pretty refreshing (even if I'm terrified to ride one in Ho Chi Minh City).
 I've visited a few Buddhist temples and seen some shrines around, and they often have food in them like apples, kumquats, etc. Is this food for anyone, or does it serve a specific purpose? I don't want to take when I'm not supposed to. EDIT: Answered! I will not take that food.
 I'm still bemused by how frequently I see Lotso Bear. He seems to be pretty popular independent of Toy Story, and I'm not quite sure why.
 I hear that avoiding eye contact is generally used when Vietnamese people are frustrated, since they want to avoid direct confrontation. I've always struggled with eye contact (I'm on the autism spectrum), so would Vietnamese people read that as a sign of anger or hostility?
  
God knows, I have plenty more thoughts, but I've worked through a lot of those with some of my friends. Thank you in advance for your input. I'm happy to be here.

 My gf wants to go to Phu Quoc as she really wants to be at a nice beach whereas i want to go to Bangkok as the weather is way too hot and humid for me to enjoy it in Phu Quoc and i would stay mostly inside in Bangkok. Also i heard from alot of friends and people living in Vietnam that Phu Quoc will be 50% rain at the time we would go there (16th Oct). Also i think the remaining time we have would be too long for a trip to phu quoc (1 Week).
 What would you guys recommend? Is there maybe a nice beach not too far from Bangkok?
 Thanks in advance! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mình có một anh bạn trai kém tuổi. Tụi mình yêu nhau đã được 1 năm, thời gian yêu nhau mình biết ảnh không có kinh tế nên hỗ trợ ảnh rất nhiều. Cụ thể là tiền thuê nhà, chi phí sinh hoạt, ăn uống hàng ngày mình đều lo cho ảnh mỗi ngày kể từ khi yêu nhau. Ảnh thì đi xin việc ở đâu cũng bị từ chối do có hình xăm nên tính ra từ khi mới yêu ảnh mới đi làm khoảng 3 tháng (không liền nhau). Thời gian còn lại lúc nào cũng kè kè bên mình. Mình luôn động viên ảnh và chỉ yêu cầu ảnh hỗ trợ mình làm 1 vài việc chân tay. Ảnh có cơ thể khá yếu nên hay kêu mệt mỏi với mình, nhiều lúc ốm mình cũng đưa ảnh đi viện để truyền và mua thuốc cho ảnh. Thật sự với mình như vậy là mình quá cảm thông cho ảnh rồi. Nhưng cho đến hôm trước mình như tức nước vỡ bờ. Ảnh mới kiếm được 1 công việc phục vụ 5 tiếng 1 ngày thì tối ảnh tan ca qua đón mình. Đó là ngày thứ 3 anh đi làm. Như mọi hôm mình đưa anh qua cửa hàng tiện lợi mua mì và nước cho ảnh hồi sức. Sau đó bọn mình có chơi game 1 lúc rồi lại về nhà mình ăn cơm và xem phim, sau đó mình cũng gọi nước sinh tố về cho anh bồi bổ. Ăn xong mình chỉ nhờ ảnh rửa bát, lúc mình bảo thì ảnh không nói gì với mình mà cứ lẳng lặng đi làm. Nhưng lúc rửa bát thì ảnh bắt đầu khó chịu với mình và nói mình không biết thông cảm cho anh đi làm cả ngày mệt và tụi mình cãi nhau. Ảnh nói từ nay ảnh không qua ăn cơm là được nhưng suốt 1 năm qua ngày nào ảnh cũng qua ăn. Mình biết tiền không phải thước đo nhưng để làm ra tiền thì mình cũng phải mất công sức và trí tuệ nên với mình đó là tấm lòng của mình. Như vậy là mình chưa thông cảm cho ảnh phải không?

 They told me it’s so bad they will never teach it to me. It’s apparently a really old slang and you need to be local local to know, hard to find on Google as well, It’s just as bad if not worse than N-word with hard r. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY’RE REFERRING TO?
 Update: It's an old slang for natives, it's used for females specifically. "Lẹo cái" seems to be the closest one but it's not complete. It's a banned word on google, my friend's only seen one text that had it written but it's been banned since. And that this generation might not know it.

I listen to this song back in like 2009 so this song was either created in 2009 or even before. But in the song there was like 3 guy(don’t know if they were brothers or friends) but they were flirting with this one girl. I guess it’s kind of like a love song but more gear towards a younger audience. I remember in the music video the artist rode a bike 😂. Finally the 3 guys made a lot of songs together. Don’t know if they were individual artist working together or they were an actual music group that only made music together. Also it was a pretty common/popular group I believe.

In the chat section, a user named "Bắn Hoả Tiễn" said something inappropriate, and in response, the commentator displayed the message "Bắn Hoả Tiễn is a dog" on the screen for all 250k viewers to see. I'm wondering why some individuals still resort to comparing others to dogs as a means of humiliating those they dislike?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why would my Vn sister-in-law do this?
 And her behaviour is really pissing me off.
 SIL asked if I wanted Ca Phe Sua Da?
 "Good idea".
 She buys 2 x Ca Phe Sua Da's. 1 for me. 1 for her. 
 I did not offer to pay. She has good job by Vn standards. Maybe that was a mistake on my side?
 But be aware I am the main banker whenever any family get-togethers occur. I pay. And they ignore me. Situation normal.
 So it felt an improvement when member of family actually thinking about me!
 I liked my Ca Phe Sua Da so much I decide to buy another one.
 I ask my SIL if she would like another Ca Phe Sua Da?
 "No".
 So I order 2 more Ca Phe Sua Da's. 1 for me and 1 for BF of SIL. ( I'm thinking of others am I not? He had no idea).
 I ask my SIL how much did the Ca Phe Sua Da man charge?
 "VND15k each. So VND30k".
 I give the guy VND30k. 
 This is where I was caught by surprise.......
 The Ca Phe Sua Da man obviously thought I had given him too much and went to put his hand in his pocket trying to say ( my Viet ain't so hot) VND25k.
 I was surprised because SIL had been very clear I would need pay VND30k.
 The amount of money is not the issue.
 What is the issue is SIL then speaks to the guy in Tieng Viet and tells him " Just take the VND30k. No need for change".
 She did not look at me. In fact she was looking away from me and the guy and at her mobile as if I would not hear and would not understand.
 He took his hand out of his pocket and tried to thank somebody and was not too sure who to look at; me or SIL. 
 So he kept his VND30k. 
 And why not! It was a very good Ca Phe Sua Da!
 The question I have is why SIL felt it necessary for foreign BIL to pay more than she did?
 Members of family frequently try to stiff me - i get the feeling they think I'm stoopid because I'm a foreigner and do not speak Tieng Viet and must therefore pay for them AND pay more.
 Hardly the behaviour of a loving family.
 What is driving this behaviour?

 My relationship with my mother is getting worse and worse everyday. She's demanding that I give her half of my salary, my salary is only 6 mil. She said that she's getting old and sick and as a child I have to give her my money,
 I refused, telling her at this age I need money for my goal and personal growth. And she kept guilt-tripping me telling she will get old and sick, I'm so fed up I told her that
 "You kept telling me that you're getting old and sick, but ever since the day you came back, what has you done for my health? Has you saved at least one penny in case my health would go bad?"
 I should've moved out earlier, it's just a part of me naively thinking that she and I could mend it back

 I personally don't like those two pronouns and don't use them much often, I think it could come out quite harsh some times, there's a reason most people don't use it with strangers. But there're people in the North assume it's the default way to call people no matter how close or distant you are, and I hate them so much, it sounds so rude if you and I aren't that close
 With my best friends and friends, I use their personal names/tôi or tao if extremely close. Ông/Tôi and Personal names/Personal names. 
 The rare cases I use "Mày" and "Tao" with my friends are when I'm trying to make a comedy skit or purpousfully acting theatrically with them.

I didn’t have a serving bowl large enough for all my noodles and broth so I just filled the red bowl up twice.

 I have noticed that SOME of my teenage students seem to celebrate and venerate the Nazi regime and Hitler himself, with some of them showing me Nazi salutes in what I assume is "humor", one student has played the Nazi anthem on his phone (I didn't know what it was until he told me) and placed his hand on his heart, and some of my students have told me that they look up to him and have proudly told me things like "I'm the biggest racist".

And that fear paralysed me ultimately, so I have never driven outside parkings :)))) That’s why, generally speaking, I can’t use a bike. Plz recommend the instructor who knows how to work it out and can do that (and teach driving skills for sure :). 
 Humor (much humor) is a great tool that helped me, for example, overcome the same thing in surfing.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Vietnamese,
 I am a Thai girl who is interested in living in Vietnam.
 The main reason is that I love Vpop and want to learn more about Vietnamese culture. I am obsessed with some big names: Son Tun Mtp, Low G, Quang Hung masterD, Amee, Tlinh, Hoang Thuy Linh,….
 Do you know Vpop is becoming more popular in Thailand? A Vietnamese guy introduced these songs to me ☺️
 There’re many reasons I want to explore Vietnam. Youth is too short to settle down.😎
 I know there is a big difference between north and south parts. My friend says HCM’s vibe is similar to Bangkok, so I choose Hanoi. I want something different. My friend will be in Hanoi soon, so he may help me a lot. And I have at least one person to hang out with
 My main concern is job hunting in Vietnam. I want to work in person with local people, so I can make friends.
 I am living in Montreal, Canada now. I studied abroad here and got a full time job, so I have work experience
 I have a degree in graphics design and diploma in photography. 
 How’s graphics design and photography industries in Vietnam? Any chance for me to get a job at a big studios or simply work as freelancer. I want to work for a professional one. I may send portfolio to potential employers.
 My other option is teaching. I took IELTS exam 2 months ago. My overall band is 7.5. Not bad, but not good enough to be English teacher.
 I have c2 in French and have lived in French speaking environment for a long time. I am thai, but my ancestors are Chinese and British, and I can speak some mandarin. I am thinking about being a French or Thai teacher.
 Do many local people want to learn French or Thai?
 Any suggestions to adapt environment in positive way, job hunting, housing and socializing?
 How do vietnamese think about Thai in general, esp female? I know some stereotypes exist
 I accidentally found this forum while googling “work in Vietnam”. Really want to get some insightful information from you guys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been wondering about this for a while now...it's late 2023, covid will never be totally gone but much of the world has gotten vaccinated and moved on as the severity of the virus has decreased. 
 I don't see too many folks on the streets masking these days, but for some reason it seems really common in high schools - I teach IELTS in high schools in Hanoi, and am surprised that sometimes up to half of my students are still masking. I wonder what the reason is - are they really doing it for health protocol? I can't imagine teenagers are particularly worried about getting sick at this point right? Do their parents make them? My theory is that a lot of young people wear them because it helps self-conscious teens feel "covered" and secured a little bit. 
 I'm not an anti-masker, these guys can do what they want - just curious why it seems so much more prevalent than in other countries (to be clear, I'm talking about students in a classroom wearing it year-long, not wearing it on the road or because they're sick.)

 It's kinda uncomfortable for me to do this. I like to sit up straight and look at the view outside. I don't want to lie down during the day.
 Maybe I am going wrong by booking the bus through the hostel? Should i go to the local bus station instead and find a sitting bus?
 Edit: I'm an idiot and actually found out how to put the seat up now so this improves my mood dramatically lol

 I wanted to do some market research to figure out what kind of designs appeal to the public - generally, Vietnamese-Americans and Vietnamese-Canadians but also anyone interested in a small fashion startup with a Vietnamese twist on it.
 Please let me know what sayings on the products would you be interested in most so I can focus on that design first.

 UPS, FedEx seem to be very expensive, VN Post seems to be unreliable at times… 
 Not sure what to use. Any experiences: I’d love to hear them. TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wifes family thinks that it is very risky to walk alone through less populated areas close to Hanoi, say 10km south of the inner city between those smalls villages. 
 They say the risk is that you get knocked out and then sold to the chinese(??) is that an actual risk? Are there real risks? Is it more or less dangerous as a foreigner?
 I'm asking because I like to take long walks through nature. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello kind folks! My partner and I are in Hanoi, planning to leave for Sapa soon. There's tons of packages at the hostel advertising trekking and homestay packages for $150 Canadian and they include accommodation, food, and sleeper bus to and from Sapa to Hanoi.
 The only problem is every single one I've seen advertised has 12km+ daily hikes. As much as I'd love to do this, I have a bad hip from past surgery and I think my max would be 5km a day. I don't wanna slow the groups down with my frequent rests or end up in a pain crisis in front of others.
 Has anyone heard of some good packages with less hiking for the old and sore travellers like me? Perhaps slow or partial hikes, or rides to villages 😅
 Or should we just buy our own bus to Sapa, find a hostel, and do our own day tours? Any advice? 
 Thank you!!

Cách đây 3 năm, tôi có 1 mối tình khá đẹp cho đến khi tôi bị cắm sừng và rồi tôi đã trả thù người yêu cũ khiến gia đình cô ta tan vỡ. Tôi sẽ gọi nyc là H. Tôi từng rất yêu và trân trọng H ngay cả khi tôi biết bản thân mình bị phản bộ, tôi cũng chỉ chấp nhận trong im lặng. Nhưng đáp lại sự tôn trọng cuối cùng đó cô ta lại lấy tôi ra để làm trò tiêu khiển bên tên khốn kia. Rồi sau vài lần nói chuyện không thể kết thúc tôi đã gửi những bằng chứng về việc bố H ngoại tình cho mẹ H và mẹ cô ta làm ầm lên rồi li hôn. Chưa cảm thấy thỏa mãn, tôi lại khiến bố cô ta bị bắt vì tội tổ chức đánh bạc và phải ngồi tù 4 năm. Sau 1 năm chia tay, tôi nghe được tin từ vài người bạn chung của 2 đứa về việc cuộc sống cô ta khá tồi tệ khi mà bố đang phải thụ án, mẹ nuôi 2 đứa em và cô ta thì cũng khá tệ. Tôi đã không cảm thấy bất kì điều gì khi tôi nghe những điều đó. 
 Đây là câu chuyện thật của bản thân mình nhưng chỉ là vắn tắt, nếu mọi người muốn nghe đầy đủ "từ tình yêu ngọt ngào đến sự trả thù không hề thương xót" hãy cmt cho mình biết.

In the writing test, I completely rushed in time. The first task is about 4 pie charts, which took me 25 minutes to finish. The second one is “Some people think that good health is very important to every person, so medical service should not be run by profit-making companies. Do the advantages of private health care outweigh the disadvantages?” I was stunned after reading it, but I still tried my best to complete the essay. When it was done, I counted the words and found out that I wrote just only 200 words, while the task requires to write at least 250 words. But I didn’t have time to add more or look over it, I had to handle it because time was up. I feel really bad now. I think I will only get 5 in writing and my parents will kill me, as I just threw their money out the window.

However, I have read that people (some?) eat dog/cat. I live in a culture where dogs/cats are pets, and I have a cat myself. I know and agree that there is not a moral difference between eating cat and for instance pig or cow, but being a cat owner (and vegetarian) I know it would be very difficult to see dog/cat meat consumption. I therefore want to avoid seeing it or being reminded of it as much as I can.
 I do not know how widespread it is, so I was hoping you could tell me if there are certain areas in Vietnam, places or situations I should avoid when travelling to avoid seeing it? Does anyone have any tips for a sensitive soul?

Can someone please explain to me, like I am a child, how to use the bus service in Hanoi? What i'm looking for are things like: Do I need to wave at the bus driver to stop or do they stop at every bus stop? Is there a button to press to tell the bus driver that I am getting off? Is every one way ticket the same price or does the price change depending on distance? Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I speak no Vietnamese other than hello and thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange question. I've been to VN four times. Have a foodie friend traveling through Asia who wanted to visit for a few days and asked me for recommendations. They will be working remote every day but will need to give some live presentations so a strong reliable wifi signal is important. 
 On the flip side, I wanted to recommend a place where they could also walk to local places for food. Originally I wanted to recommend Hoi An for the experience, but I wouldn't trust the wifi enough (at least not at the bandwidth they'd need). Maybe Da Nang but the hotels that I'd assume would have the best wifi are not near areas that are very walkable and are very touristy. They could visit Hoi An for a half day trip though. Then I was thinking Nha Trang - I remember staying near the water in a modern hotel and could walk down narrow streets to some hidden gems though it was pretty touristy. That was pre-pandemic, maybe they got pushed out...not sure.
 Open to other suggestions (and I'll probably add them to my own itinerary next trip)!

 I never have been in an Asia country. Do you have any recommendations around Ho-Chi-Minh-City like jungle, beach and sightseeing? Which district is a good one for tourists?
 Is it easy to move by train or bus to my destinations or is it better to get a taxi/Uber (what will they charge)?!

 Also, other than statistics, has height increased dramatically since Vietnam has started to grow economically? To a level where it is noticeable?

 What seems questionable to me is they're trying to confuse people between "not selling" and "not sold out". I assume a concert ticket not sold out after 3 days is pretty normal, but it seems they're making it looks like not a sinlge ticket is sold and it's the worst show ever. 
 As I don't really care much about Vbiz, what exactly happened? Is she really that bad or just she provoked some hidden big media company?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm Vietnamese and planning to go under some courses to become a tour guide. It's the most suitable career path I could think of right now for myself, for my future. 
 I'm currently living in Hanoi, which I think is quite convenient, because I feel that tourism is our strength and is quite developed here. I mean, we have the Old Quarters and Ha Long Bay and other fascinating and breath-taking places in all the provinces close and nearby Hanoi. I've always thought that I'm in the best place in Vietnam if I want to persue tourism as a career path.
 But my heart and soul all lie in Sai Gon. I love Saigon and the fact it's more gay-friendly. I'm gay and have no friends in Hanoi, I mean I do have but in Saigon I have more of my people. I want to join them, be with them, and support each other. Unlike here in Hanoi, all alone. The only thing stopping me from having moved to Saigon a long time ago is the fact that I still think Hanoi is better for persuing Tourism. I'm currently not on any career path, and I'm 23 now, It's my career, not my social life, that I should pay attention to.
 But I love Saigon, I just don't know how the whole tourism is for Saigon. Do I have much chances to grow with tourism, as much as I think I have in Hanoi?

He dressed, ate, and lived like an average farmer, he treated everyone as an equal and he also wanted to be treated as an equal by us as well. So why are we treating him like he's the God Emperor from 40k. For example, we preserve his corpse in something that is almost like a temple. And yet teachers, parents and practically everyone that i talk to compares him to a god. I'm not hating on him, I appreciate his efforts in freeing this country. But I'm confused on why we are treating in the exact opposite way that he wanted to be treated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American here.
 When visiting to my local barnes and noble recently it was obvious from first glance that a lot of media from Asia is popular. My bookstore shelves are stocked to the brim with Japanese, Korean, even Chinese comics and light novels, figurines, the works. Korean and Japanese pop stars fill the music section, easily holding their own against big western pop stars like Gaga and Bieber.
 But aside from some novels in the young adult section of my bookstore written by Vietnamese Americans, or the usual biographies in the history section discussing the war. There's not a lot of pop culture made by Vietnamese that's popular in the western market as other asian countries. Not a lot of fantasy or horror novels, not a lot of manga, not even the odd pop star. 
 You'd think with how much has changed in US-Vietnam relations since the war we'd be seeing more Vietnamese pop culture get exported over here. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Why is that?
 And it's not like Americans are biased against Vietnamese culture because of the war or years of action movies. Far from it. Vietnamese Food is very popular in places like Los Angeles and Toronto, but vietnamese pop culture seems to have fallen completely by the wayside.
 So I'm here to ask for theories on why Vietnamese media isn't as big of a thing in the west as the other nations cultures. And also to ask for recommendations on vietnamese books, movies, tv, manga etc. that I might be interested in?

She jokingly said that i needed to grow a pair of balls. Back with the talk with her parents their idea we agreed that we are going to get married on paper in home country because she will get my passport. So she will be coming next month so we can do the formalities. I would love to do it in a church but thats just not possible. Second talking point was where are we going to live. I told them about my plans but i was immediately shut down. They told me that it's better to live the first 2 3 years of the childs life near them, the reasoning here is they want to be involved in the upbringing a little bit and because it's their first grandchild. After that they dropped the bomb that they want us to move to Singapore after those 2 3 years. Reasoning for this are plenty but I'll list some important ones : they are opening some offices there and they need someone to manage it and my wife is the candidate, better opportunity and it's not far away from home. I didn't expected this but I call them after i had some time thinking about it. Third was their question of when i will be moving. Told them that if she comes in a month I'll need about 4 months to move. Because it takes some time to move your life. Fourth was the naming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have to go on a business trip to Vietnam with my team of five employees. The Vietnamese company has asked us for a $1,000 "introduction fee," which appears to be a form of bribery. I'm concerned and wondering if this is common practice in Vietnam. Should I comply and give them the fee? 
 I have previous experience doing business with Chinese companies, and fortunately, I didn't encounter such situations. This is the first time I've come across this issue during my business endeavours. 
 I want to hear your advice. What should I do? Should I give them the fee?
 Thank you!

Who is allowed to use pepper spray? The law only allows certain objects to be equipped with supporting tools, including pepper spray. Accordingly, in Clause 1, Article 55 of the Law on Management and Use of Weapons, Explosives and Support Tools 2017 stipulates that subjects equipped with combat gears include:
  
 
National Army;
 
Militia and self-defense;
 
Coast Guard;
 
Police;
 
Weak muscles;

I’m going on a trip in the next few weeks to Indonesia for a month to dive and then heading to Vietnam for a month to travel (planning north to south) I don’t really want to carry my dive gear around with me for the whole month. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on shipping my luggage home or if it would be cheaper to rent a locker in Hanoi and leave it there while I go down south and then fly back up to Hanoi from Ho Chi Minh and fly home from Hanoi? Online it says that shipping a suitcase from Hanoi to the US would be like $400, does that sound about right? Thank you for your help!! :)

We read in a few posts that you can exchange it in gold shops, however in most posts they were only talking about USD. Does anyone have experience with exchanging less popular currencies like the SEK? I (from a euro country with a bank account in euros) can withdraw from an ATM without any fees, my partner however would have to pay rather high fees so we are trying to avoid that (he cannot simply transfer to me, it is a really complicated process for him to transfer within Europe with his bank). So we were thinking of simply bringing some Swedish Leonor and exchanging it in Vietnam.
 Edit: my autocorrect changed kronor in the title to Ironie, that wasn’t my intention 😂. It seems however that I cannot edit the title anymore

I have an American drivers license with motorcycle endorsement M1. So does my wife. My friend only has a drivers license, no motorcycle endorsement.
 This is what is states on: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Vietnam.html
 Because the United States is not a party to the Convention on Road Traffic, international driving permits and U.S. drivers’ licenses are not valid in Vietnam. Foreigners renting vehicles risk fines, prosecution, and/or imprisonment for driving without a Vietnamese license endorsed for the appropriate vehicle. If you wish to drive in Vietnam, contact the Provincial Public Transportation Service of the Vietnamese Department of Communications and Transport to obtain a Vietnamese driver’s license. Note that you may be required to take a medical examination as part of the driver license application process. 
 Can I get away with a International Driving Permit on the Ha Gaing Loop while remaining legal?
 Otherwise, what do I need to get? I would like to avoid bribing government officials.
 Thanks

I live near Hàng Mã street and I saw all kind of parents letting their kids standing up in the seat holding toys and latterns, it's like they're telling their children to have some practice before some circus show.

There is clearly zero necessity for such loud noises for a motorbike to function normally. Those people are narcissistic, egoistic, uneducated individuals who think what they're doing is cool, and they're purposely doing it to grab other people's attention (lack of attention much?). They also ride with super fast speed in sub-urban areas too, which is dangerous for the public's safety where many children or elders are on the streets. Most of them are gangster-wannabe guys in their 20s or early 30s. It seems like authorities don't do anything to seriously put an end to this, unless in popular, large streets.

I will admit I am not a history honor student, but I do remember that there was barely anything about this in the (Vietnamese) history text book. I know the political situation at the time was extremely complex, with all the communist allies infighting, fallout from the end of the Vietnam war and general fear of the Soviets at the time. But the fact that Vietnam pushed all the way to the capital of Cambodia to overthrow one of the most brutal regime in human history, all the while facing pressure not only from the Pro-Chinese countries, but also from the Western Democratic world, is one hell of a tale. Why is it so often forgotten? Link of you want to read about it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War.

 I noticed that a lot of them are trying to discredit Vietnam. It seems like a lot of Chinese see the alliance between the US and Vietnam as a threat

I have a different name when I live in Vietnam, which is Khanh Huyen. The story I am sharing here happened in 2018, when I first visited Vietnam. I don't know how to say it in a way that you guys can understand, but in order to use Reddit, we have to use a VPN, and we nicknamed it "Vietnamese Pho Noodle". And that's right, the reason I wanted to come to Vietnam was because I wanted to try pho.
 After arriving in Hanoi, it was already late, so we decided to leave the sightseeing for the next morning. The next morning, my parents went to do the paperwork for me because we also intend to live in Vietnam. So my mom gave me "500,000 VND" (It was around 150 yuan) to go out and eat wha…]]></summary>

 The story goes like this, for our 4th anniversary we went to Thailand and one night we both got really drunk really drunk and she told me it's OK to finish inside. As a monkey i got really excited and did it without thinking of the consequences. Month and half later i get a call with a positive test. I literally froze and the only thing i can think about is getting my shit together. I would like to point out that i don't have a look on this situation as my life is over it's just a natural progression of life that may happened a little earlier. She told me that she hasn't told her parents yet because she wanted to tell me first. We had a serious talk about further progression and when will I move. After the call I immediately talked with my parents because it's a serious shift in my life dynamic and because i need to prepare the funds for the move. The mindset of our parents was already pushing us to get married so we don't have to worry about family disapproval. The only problem here is the sudden switch in our lives. 
 So i have a couple of questions: What's the price of land in Hanoi? Planning on building a house Dual citizenship is it possible for all countries? Asking for the kid Is 5 years maximum for visa exemption? How much will I be paying in taxes? 
 If you have some questions for me ask me in the comment

 We've been in Da Nang half a day now and every single driver has asked us whether they can drive us back to the hotel and offer to hang around wherever we are so that we can use them over Grab.
 Is this expected or some sort of scam? Every time we say Grab has been perfect for us and I've never waited for more than 2 minutes so it's not like I don't trust them but rather I don't want to waste their time waiting around for us.
 Writing this as I sit in a Grab whilst the driver is trying to tell us what our plans are coming back tonight on Google Translate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I (24M) am currently in a relationship with my girlfriend (23F). We're planning to get married in about 2-3 years once our financial situations improve. Recently, I was chatting with my dad about life in general, and the topic of having kids came up. Personally, I'm not too concerned about having children. I know I could be a great dad, but I'd also be perfectly fine without kids. My girlfriend has also hinted that she doesn't want children, and I didn't push the conversation further because either outcome is okay with me.
 When I shared this with my dad, he didn't react well. In fact, he called both of us crazy and said we weren't in our right minds. No matter how much I tried to explain our decision, he kept insisting that I'd change my mind eventually. This really upset me because he wasn't respecting our choice and was trying to influence it.
 I can already see this topic coming up again in the future, and I don't know how to get through to him. I understand that he's getting older and wants grandchildren, which makes it tough because I know how much it would hurt him not to have his own. My older brother is also uncertain about his stance on kids. Any advice on how to handle this?

 I'm Vietnamese Canadian and I have a sweet viet gf. She's little older than me, but calls me "em." often. She rarely or never calls me "anh." I think it's weird but I'm use to it now...
 I call her "em" or "đai ca" in Vietnamese. Or "baby" or "boo." in English. 
 Is there a word to call your gf or wife if little older than you? She's 3 years older than me, but I love her dearly as there is no age difference.

 We are 2 adults visiting Vietnam this December. We both are foodies and always love to try local cuisine.
 What are some of the local favorite places that we should not miss? We mostly prefer street food or small restaurants but can also visit upscale ones if it is worth it. We also like to try vegetarian food so please recommend if you know any good local vegetarian restaurants. 
 I know that this is a subjective question. But I am trying to see what kind of suggestions I get so I can make the best decision and cover some good spots within the few days we are in Hanoi. 
 Thanks.

There were a group of young guys breakdancing there. One of them was a young vietnamese man with a blach t-shirt and brown pants. He was really handsome and danced really nice. I was wondering if anyone here could help me find him, I would like to ask him out on a date.

 Please give me some tips. I am worried not to get into scam. Worried of falling sick alone in the country. The bana hills look too much crowded to me. Shall I skip it ? What is there to see except the bridge? Between hoi An and danang, where should I book hotel ? Also, is it a good idea to get a bus /train from Saigon to da nang or better to book flight ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m (F21) Vietnamese American and just got back from traveling to Vietnam for a week. I stayed in one hotel the whole trip and ended up getting along really well with the staff. We were all similar age, and I was so happy to become friends with some locals. 
 Yesterday, before I left and checked out of my hotel room, the staff asked if they could take a picture with me to keep as a memory. Since I was in a rush, I forgot to ask them for their contact info/social media and if they could send the picture to me. Now I’m really really regretting it and am sad I won’t be able stay in touch with them or remember their faces in the future…
 Do you think there is any way to reach out to the staff? Should I contact the hotel? Or would that be weird and I should just let it be?

I looked into grab and it's showing about 2000000 dong one way, which is cheaper than what my hotel is quoting me. Can I really just hire a grab for this trip? 
 I know there are cheaper ways (sleeper bus, moped) but I would prefer taxi and possibly making one stop along the way.

The locals were notably less friendly compared to our previous experiences in Vietnam. Additionally, it was disheartening to witness young children, aged 3 to 5, selling souvenirs to tourists on the streets. Would not recommend!

 Her name is Xuan. Any tips on how to say this from an English speaking perspective?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been close to this vietnamese woman. I'm 30 she's 31. She's in a term contract in my laboratory for 1 year. I am an introvert, so does she, and both of us have been single forever. I talk way less than her, and she always talk nonstop with me but not with others. Initially she seems couldn't fit in with my other lab members because language barrier, so I tried to setup a trip with international students in our lab to make her comfortable. We ended up going to a lot of trips, but lately it was just only the both of us and mostly it was her idea. 
 We got busier and ended up often having dinner together. From then on I had a crush on her and one day I confess. I was rejected because she want to focus on work and family first, but also because we won't be able to meet for that long and she doesn't want to have a heartbreak from breakup. Strangely, we became even closer than before. Now only a few weeks before she go back to her old lab in another country, she wants me to spend the last day with her and wants to stay together with me and share a room. I am also from SEA, and I don't think this is quite normal, as in sharing a room but not a couple. But she said it is normal in vietnam. Is this true? If you're also a woman, I would like to know what do you think of this.
 Edit: Thank you for the replies. I tried to reply, but because this is a new account, the bot wouldn't let me unless allowed by the actual mods. I don't want to inconvenience the mods each time I want to reply. I am not sure about using my main account. But still, thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so i'm a hs student, việt kiều, but i went to live with family in saigon in the summer. since then we've been considering my transferring to an international school there, but it would only be for my final year of hs. we found one that parallels my current education seemingly perfectly; it has the program i'm in and provides the same diploma and even (supposedly) has the same standards as my current school board. nothing has been worked out or confirmed yet but i just had a few questions. 
 if anyone has been to or heard about both international schools in saigon and hs in north america, how do they compare in terms of education standards? would it be a difficult switch? what is the general student demographic - are there a lot of việt kiều or foreigners? what's the student social life/culture like?
 edit: the specific school in mind is CIS (Canadian International School) but at this point we'll still consider other options.

 I plan to do touristy things and travel all over Vietnam from South-Central-North amongst other fun things.
 I plan to be in Hoi An for the Lantern festival and Da Nang in the end of September to early October; Hanoi-HaLong-NinhBinh around mid October. Otherwise, I’ll be situated in HCM D1.
 How bad is the rainy season? Will the rainy season be so bad that I end up being indoors majority of the travels? 
 Any advice or travel tips are much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m 29F from Philippines and I am seeing this 30M Vietnamese for quite some time now. We are both professional and worked in the same industry. We are getting to know each other and our relationship is good so far. I’ve been to Vietnam few times already and also tried to stay for few weeks. I really like the food and the people, btw :) and he also visited my country. But the only problem is he cannot see the relationship to progress or lead to marriage because I’m from a different country, culture differences and he is thinking how will his family reacts to our relationship etc. Well, on my end there will be no issues as I think Filipino families are more open to this kind of setup. 
 I know for sure that I don’t want to get married, (in near future at least) but of course we also respect and don’t want to waste each other’s time. I do like him and willing to make this relationship to work.
 I just want to ask some insights about this kind or relationship, is it not common or hard to accept in Vietnam? Should I give up? 
 I really appreciate your time reading this. Please be kind in the comment section :)

However, sometimes we are bested by bad banh mi or xoi. When it (occasionally) strikes I just want loperamide or a similar drug so we can get on with our teaching. But the pharmacists always give me this? What is it actually? 
 I have basic Vietnamese, like ordering food or instructing kids what to do, but no idea when it comes to medical stuff.

 For just a few million Vnd more you can get the same style bike (Semi auto underbone) whether it's a Honda Wave or Yamaha Sirius.
 Are the Facebook sellers being greedy or is it to do with the "retro" look?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last hour today I feel I lived in a real life miracle. I was passenger on a motorbike, wife was driving, I dropped my wallet that was in my pants pocket. All my Id are in there, bank cards, the card key for the apartments we are living in. So we try the impossible, going back and forth, looking for my wallet dropped in the street. Phan Xich Long street is crowded, can’t drive back in the same lane, everything seems desperate and futile. We end up driving back till the barber shop I just been before losing the wallet. They went trough a lot of effort helping us, showing us security camera footage of the last hour to check if by any chance I dropped my wallet there. Seem there is nothing more we can do. Suddenly my wife receive a phone call. It was one guy working as security in the street. Thanks to the house card key he found in the wallet he was able to trace back the phone number of my wife. He even makes sure to my wife to show up with me, to avoid a possible landlord to retrieve easy money. Such a thoughtful move. There was my wallet, money untouched. I gave him all I had in the wallet, 2 million dong, and he right away split equally with his partner. I’m happy that this small luck ended up in the hands people in the security, among all others.
 I know how much I was lucky, but still nobody can talk me out of thinking that this could have happen only in this Country. Kudos to all the good people of Vietnam. 🫰

 Personally, a good bowling alley must be facilitated with professional-grade equipment (pin setters, scoring system, standard size lanes, balls,...) along with good food/beverage services while being affordable for the young folks. Granted, there may be dozens of bowling alleys popping up on Google, but many of them either lack the qualities mentioned above OR they are closed... permanently. 
 In the past year, I have been to many bowling alleys, and I have come up with a curated list of the goats. I have also ranked them, with the top one being…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I stated in an earlier post I am traveling the country with a good friend of mine, we have had a great time so for, even though there were some things to figure out at first. Now after 2 weeks living with his family we are traveling to the south, he told me to travel ahead so he could visit yet another family. This way he won't get bored with my touristy stuff and I dont have to sit around all day not being able to talk to the family.
 When we were with his family we made two trips in total, 1 to sapa and one to Ha Long Bay, both times the Hotel tried to rip us off not wanting to give us the rooms we specifically booked or telling us to cancel our reservation to "check in earlier and get a cheaper price" we never took the offerm. In Person he could talk to the people in vietnamese and would solve the matter easily in a short time. But now I am alone and the scamming and persistencefrom drivers, sellers and hotel stuff only got worse. Today the hotel refused me to let me check in early even though we have agrees on it online and they have said that it would be no problem. Now when I wanted to check in they told me I could only check in if I cancelled the reservation or I would have to wait 2 hours more. I decided to just straight up wait, to not risk being overcharged without an receip showing the confirmed price from booking.com (many people warn you that that would happen if you cancel the reservation )
 This is my first travel alone/with a friend outside of my own country (Germany) and I don't know what to do, it is really frustrating. Am I being overprotectiv ? Any tips on how to deal with this better would be much appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow travelers!
 I am travelling to Veitnam with my GF from 1-9 Oct. Landing in Hanoi and going back home from via Phu Quoc.
 So my Plan is: 1. 4 Days in Hanoi Ha long and Ninh Binh 2. Maybe Hoi an and danang 3. And last 2-3 Days in Phu quoc
 What I am actually confused about is whether my gf and I should go to Hoi an or not as it is monsoon season with risk of flooding. Also our iternary is too tight ;(
 So I wanted your advice on whether we should do Hoi an or visit some place else considering the weather conditions.
 It is our first time in Vietnam so we want to make sure to experience the best.
 Please help 😓 , I am pretty confused about how to do this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I’m planning on visiting Vietnam next year and was just wondering how much I could possibly see in 2 weeks, which order would make this the most efficient, and what time of year would be best.
 I’d love to visit 
 Visit Halong Bay, Cat Ba Island, cave in Phong Nha National Park, War museum, Ban Gioc Waterfall, Golden Hands Bridge, And the Ha Giang Loop
 Is there anything else you would consider a “must see” or anything that’s not really worth it ?

 But I saw much much much more gay couples walking on the street compared to here in Hanoi.

 Just wanted to post here to express how much I fucking adore this place, and random observations i have made. There are some issues and I'll post about problems as well, but I really like Vietnam a lot.
 I'm not just some backpacker. I really did my homework on this place before coming here. It has allowed me to integrate here way faster than most people. In the space of a few days I bought a motor bike and started renting an apartment.
 I'm an English teacher (obvious I guess) and my salary is higher than many locals so I guess that clouds my perceptions of this place a little bit.
 Everything here is so much cheaper than back home. The west is stagnating and many millennials are financially fucked. Out here its possible to actually hustle ahead rather…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never been in a romantic relationship with anyone in my entire life and I fail to see how this might change in the long run. I personally don't think I would be suitable for any kind of romantic relationship and the mere thought of being forced into / being a part of one makes me feel hopeless and sick. Marriage is obviously out of the question. Having kids also seems to me to be an enormous and exhaustive investment and I would not want to force any potential child to live in this increasingly difficult society without having, you know, their consent.
 However, it's all too common that people from the older generation here tend to think that my position on marriage is simply insane and my parents are no exception. They did not stress much about the fact that I've never cared to have a partner (they think I'm the hot shit and millions of people would die to be wedded to me, which is objectively not the case). But now that I almost finish university and still make no move whatsoever, they constantly bring this topic up and push me to go out into the world and look for someone who would marry me and have my kid. It was kinda heartbreaking to see how badly they want to have grandchildren so I fucked up by telling them that I would marry really late, like at my 40s so that they would stop pestering me about that in the near future (and also once I'm 40s I could tell them that I'm too old for marriage). They got mildly frustrated and forced me to marry 5 years from now, for many reasons.
 People who choose to stay single, what should I do? Because I told them that I would marry late, they now think that marriage is still on the table and all they need to do is to force me to marry way sooner than I'd like. What can I say to them so that they would accept the fact that they would not have grandchildren and that their son would not marry, (and that they and I might get side-eye from relatives because of this decision)?
 I would really appreciate your responses!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I, from the North, had a chance to visit Saigon for a month. Everyone I knew told me to be careful with my belonging when I'm there, especially with me having to be extra careful because I'm careless and always walk around using my phone.
 First day in Saigon, I took a bus, and forgot my wallet with all my cash and all kinds of identification papers on there. I was so scared, I couldn't do anything without them, I couldn't even go back home if I wanted to without those papers. I remembered the number of the bus, the number on them showed the route they took, but couldn't remember the exact plate numbers of the specific one I got on. There were many different busses numbered the same. 
 I thought it was the end for me. Turned out 1 and a half hour later, I found it sitting still, untouched and intact in the same bus seat I was sitting in, despite being a very crowed day with lots of people in and out of busses. During my time in Saigon, I all walked around the streets with my eyes glued to the phone, because habits. So far, nobody has tried to grab it from me. Maybe the rumors that Saigon is full of petty crime thefts is largely exaggerated?
 But hey, this could simply fall in the case of "this-has-never-happened-to-me-so-it-must-not-be-true" fallacy people often use. Maybe because I'm a dude?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My partner and I are planning on visiting Vietnam around March / April next year and am having a bit of difficulty nailing down a trip that doesn't seem too packed! We're in our early 30's and like a bit of a mix of adventure (more myself) and relaxation (beach time).
 We're travelling from Australia and there aren't any direct flights to Hanoi so we'll be flying in and out of HCMC.
 Below is a planned schedule but something (maybe multi destinations) have to go unless we can pull superhuman strength. We're locked into 17 nights and can't do any longer unfortunately. Would love to hear your recommendations about what you might consider leaving off, and where to possibly spend a bit more time.
 Day 1 – Fly into Saigon. Arrive late so just stay somewhere near the airport.
 Day 2-3 - Fly to Hanoi. Spend 2 nights staying in Old Quarter, visit some sights, food tour etc.
 Day 4 - Spend morning in Hanoi before getting an afternoon bus / limousine to Ha Giang so we can see the views on the way (or should we just get a later bus and spend a few more hours in Hanoi?)
 Day 5-6 - 2 night Ha Giang Loop tour
 Day 7 - Finish Ha Giang Loop and arrive back in Hanoi late
 Day 8 - Do an overnight cruise in La Han Bay
 Day 9-10 - Head to Ninh Binh (Tam Coc) for 2 nights
 Day 11 - Spend day exploring Ninh Binh before getting overnight train to Dong Hoi
 Day 12-13 - Get bus from Dong Hoi to Phong Nha, explore caves and do a single day tour with Oxalis / Jungle Boss
 Day 14 - Get DMZ bus to Hue
 Day 15-17 - Motorcycle ride from Hue to Hoi An via Hai Van Pass, spend 3 nights in Hoi An relaxing / beach time
 Day 18 - Flight from Danang to HCMC before flying out late that night
 Thanks!

 I was adopted from Vietnam in 1997, shortly after became a U.S. Citizen with US Passport, etc. My adoptive parents have my original Vietnamese birth certificate and papers, since I was born in Vietnam.
 Is it a tough process to get a Vietnamese Passport? From what I read it seems like as long as I have the correct Vietnamese Paperwork it should just be a submission and waiting period. I would like to have both my US and Vietnamese Passports. Any help is much appreciated!

One dude told me that only Americans do that? Which is weird, since I know it's optional to place one's hand over chest while doing the anthem, and it means pledging allegiance to the flag but don't think it's exclusive for Americans. Just out of curiosity, just pop the question to see if anybody's done the same.

I saw people saying it is recommended to arrive 2–3 hours earlier just in case, and we are fine with that however, this means that we would need to be taking the grab from our Airbnb to the airport probably at 4/5am in the morning. 
 My question is, is it safe to take a grab car this early in the morning? We would be in Ho Chi Minh! We just want to have some confirmation that it is indeed safe, as we are both quite young and have never really travelled before. Thank you! :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Danang has been a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the big city life but I just walked past an empty street, full of vendors with cartfull of nicely presented, but untouched, foods and it made me feel all kinds of ways. I bought a coconut off a lady at a drinks stall just cause she seemed really sad sitting there alone and I felt a little choked up thinking about how much she might have sold tonight in the muggy heat. 
 I get that it’s off season now but it really feels like this town lives off of tourism as I don’t see a lot of locals dining out and I might be projecting but a lot of the businesses seem to be struggling. 
 I just feel very sad seeing all these restaurants with flashy signs sitting empty and potentially even guilty when I make eye contact with the employees inside as I catch glimmers of hope in their eyes that I might come in and dine. 
 I’m recovering from a tummy bug and taking precautions as to not eat at empty places and there are so many coconuts I can buy from a place to support the local businesses. 
 It’s really lovely here though and the people have been so kind. Other than being slightly hotter, it hasn’t even been as rainy as in HCMC so I wish more people would come and visit this lovely place.

No judgment, people can think what they like I just want to know because I’ve never come across this in Vietnam before (although I wasn’t that shocked, I wanted to know if there’s any truth to it) .
 Edit: the second question she asked me was about religion after the usual tell me about yourself. Looking back I should have asked if it’s relevant but I didn’t think it would be a problem.

 Trả tiền mặt chỉ mất tầm 15-30s, trong khi chuyển khoản hay momo để trả tiền xăng nhanh nhất cũng mất 1, 2p để người bán lấy máy, nhập số tiền r sinh mã để các bạn quét, đợi thanh toán xong và trả kết quả về máy. Còn lâu hơn nhiều nếu như 2 bạn trên còn mò tìm nhập mã giảm giá, tìm điểm phát wifi 4G, etc. Thử tưởng tượng giờ cao điểm chỉ cần 2, 3 bạn như thế thì những người đằng sau mất bao nhiêu thời gian? 1 cái tiện nhỏ của các bạn có thể làm mất bao thời gian và tiền bạc của nhiều người khác.

 It really strikes me as odd as a Vina that grew up Canada. Does your average Vietnamese actually have THAT MUCH faith in the school system that it will teach a person everything they need to know?

 I'm deathly allergic to cashews and pistachios but I can eat peanuts, almonds, walnuts, and pecans -- though I don't always trust folks to make that distinction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favorite places to get coffee was the one right by my granny's home, an old lady would sell beverages to the local construction workers there, and her coffee would be around 20000 VND. I had been drinking her Ca Phe Sua Da for years, and I loved it so much I would buy one almost every single day. Unfortunately, she closed the place indefinitely around a month ago, and I have tried many places since.
 The one thing I noticed was I would find the street coffees drastically better than the ones sold in those fancy cafeteria places with ACs and Jazz music playing 24/7. The street Ca Phe Sua Da are sweet, rich, just bitter enough, and their temperature is perfect - not too hot, not too cold. 
 It is extremely hard to match the flavor with the one I had been drinking for all these years though. Some places make it too bitter with little sweetness, some make it taste like a milkshake. The "closest" one which I kind of enjoy comes from, you guest it, the nice middle-aged lady not too far away from my grandma's home. 
 Is there a secret to those street coffees? I want to remake it myself, all those years drinking her coffee and now she closed it, it kinda hurt a little bit :>

 My question is about both politics and economics.
 Vietnam is considered to be more open than China, in terms of investment as well as censorship.
 However, China also had a period where it was considered much more open than it is today.
 Many people describe Vietnam as being very similar to China, only delayed by 20 years or so. On the other side, some people say that there is a qualitative difference between the two countries, due to the different "tone" under which Vietnam was founded - Ho Chi Minh being a world traveler, having Democratic hopes for Vietnam, appreciating Western Democracy, etc. Those people also say that power is a bit less centralized in Vietnam's system.
 However, without institutions in place …]]></summary>

It’s my first time being with a Vietnamese girl so im still actually learning her culture. Anybody could give any advice?

Always late (1 HOUR wait has become a norm this past 2 weeks) and drive the buses like it's a motorbike. On top of that, most have broken ACs or doors won't close completely. You can't track the buses accurately. Unfortunately VinBuses don't pass by Ciputra in Hanoi. I'd pay 20k for a premium bus experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went to a public pool with my nephew yesterday, it was very crowded. And at the kid's pool area, I could notice that it's much harder for me to find a kid being in shape than to find a kid who's not. Almost every little kids I saw carried a big belly with them. There're so many adults who are overweights too.
 I know that one public pool with max of 100 people isn't exactly great of a sample size to draw conclusion for millions of Vietnamese. But it does raise some concern, because in my experience, Vietnamese parents don't really care much about diets, calories and nutrions. They all thought the fatter the kids, the better, and subsequently trying to feed them as much as possible. And if they aren't gaining in size and being underweigh, it's not their "growing up times" yet. Fast foods aren't really that popular, I think, so we can't blame it on them
 I was 173cm, 45kg for most of my childhood, throughout my earlier years, my parents and relatives has kept telling I'm not at my "time" yet, and kept taking me to doctors and they weirdly said the same, not "my time" yet. Turned out at 22 years old, I was still that skinny. It's not until I decided to eat like hell and learn nutrions did I gained 10kg in 2-3 months. They complmented me saying I'm finally "at my time", no I just ate like crazy.

My luggage just had my clothes and random shampoo and body care stuff for my family. My Vietnamese is pretty good but not good enough to understand what she was trying to pull me over for. I remember my uncle saying something like if they give me a hard time just give them $20. I literally gave her $20 and she’s like no it’s $50. And to shove it discreetly in the drawer for her. I didn’t carry that much cash with me and was planning to withdraw some from the ATM. And I didn’t like how that lady was threatening me so I called my aunt. My aunt told me to ask her for the citation receipt and she said she was trying to help me but we can do it the “hard way” and I have to pay $200 wtf. My aunt wanted to speak to her and she told me to hang up and refused to talk to my aunt and told me I’m a grown adult to take care of it myself. Luckily my aunt knew someone in the airport and he spoke to them and they let me go without paying anything. I wasn’t annoyed they do shady stuff like that, I was annoyed how she spoke to me!
 Edit - I’d also like to point out that scanner lady is a complete moron because she asked for my passport and didn’t flip to the right page with all my info. She pretended to be all official demanding my documentations.

Like in our daily life we still talk about them with no hate feeling and very neutral. Except for China, China still actively messing with us and have not give up. Even though, our economy is greatly effect, reply on China we aware of them.
 That my perspective as Vietnamese live our daily life. So what other nation is like, because it seems like China still hate Japan, media about Japan and protry Japan as bad where china kick their ass still very popular til today. From Japan media, it seem like Japan still effects by some contract with the US but from some Japanese movie it seem like also protray Japan have their sin. And worst of all is racist thing in America, black still hate white af and still think they are oppressed today. This remind me how different that is in Vietnam, because we also have minority. If you live in some era where you can still see some local people living among us, they look actually very different than the usual Vietnam people, some also have really dark skin and different hair, if you look in too school system there are also advance thing you can get if you are "Dan toc thieu so" (Wait a minutes, we too have black people).

Nhà ở VN đã bán lâu rồi (trên 10 năm). Tôi còn giữ sổ hộ khẩu cũ nhưng chắc bị cắt lâu rồi. Tôi vẫn còn họ hàng ở VN và sẽ ở nhà bà con. Tôi muốn hỏi muốn làm CCCD thì sẽ cần những gì?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen several people asking about how to send money from the U.S. or Canada to Vietnam, so I thought I should put together this tutorial.
 And I can't believe that not enough folks are taking advantage of the promotion Remitly is running.
  
Pay zero fees on your first transfer. Get $20 off your first transfer when you send $100 or more.
  
The math: Send $100 from the U.S. to a Vietnamese bank account, cash pickup location, or home delivery, and it will only cost you $80. Remitly will cover the other $20. Oh, and there is no fee!
 So here we go...
 Step 1: Click here to sign up for a Remitly account (click the green "Send Now" button).
 Step 2: Enter your email address and password.

 Me and my 10 year old son are planning to travel to Vietnam for Christmas holiday. We plan to fly to Hanoi (4 days) . Then we have 10 more days. We were planning to visit Ha long and stay there on rest of the days but I realised december is chilly. Then I accept to pay for another flight to Ho chi Min city to be closer to the beaches but I read here about Vung Tau, water is brownish and full of garbage. 
 I checked some list of beaches but some beaches can be more suitable for surfers. I want to avoid them. There is never a clear info which beach is suitable for which purpose
 Do you have any idea where can we go for swimming for a week from Hanoi or Ho Chi Min city easily?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just after I booked via Booking.com (flexible rate, which I guaranteed with my credit card details) I got a message via Booking and received the following information, among others:
 PAYMENT TERMS: Since reservations via Booking.com are not yet PAID, so the payment must be PAID in Full in ADVANCE before the travel date. Basing on real past customers' experience and due to the busy and tight schedule and limitation of internet / 3gb connection in Halong bay to guarantee a smoothly trip we require the customer to make the payment completely in advance to avoid these common issues/ problems which will affect seriously your precious time with us such as: Unsuccessful payment due to the internet connection. Being stressful and confused about the payment method after the trip. Problem with customer own credit card (Invalid card, insufficient funds) Since credit card charging is no longer our payment method, we will send you the Invoice via Secured Online Payment Link: Just complete your payment by using VISA/ MASTER and JVC card (2.8 % bank charges)
 And, after asking something:
 “The card info that you provide on booking is just to ensure booking, It doesn't charge any amount. Guests will pay via a Government secured link, and we guarantee that you just pay One time for the trip, Never Double charge Do you have whatsapp to contact you better?“
 Is this common practice of handling a payment and I am too sceptical? It sounds a bit suspicious to me and I have booked a few other hotels for this trip but have not received such a payment method / request.
 Appreciate your help!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This comes from my experience taking care of my sister. She tried to commit suicide by overdosing on paracetamol, and she was obviously rushed to the hospital. The hospital was Bach Mai Hospital, which I heard was one of the best hospitals in the country. It made me more shocked when, even in the best hospital, I heard a lot of people and even one of the doctors talk about how suicidal people should not be allowed to receive treatment. "Because they want to die anyway." they say. It was infuriating because my sister could also hear them. She even commented about it, saying she agreed. She wasn't in her right mind, and it makes me so upset that people could say such a thing in front of a patient. I know Vietnam still wasn't very knowledgeable about mental health, but it wasn't even about that. It's about a person's life; even if they want to take their own life, you are not to treat them differently. It's sickening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I’ve been in Vietnam for about two months now and I’m currently sat having a coffee on the Walking Street. One of the buildings across the road started throwing what looks like money and rice off the roof and everyone started yelling and scrambling to grab the notes. There’s now a crowd (with people running up the street to join) and it looks like they are handing out money.
 I was just wondering if anyone could explain what’s happening?
 Thanks :)
 Edit: this is in HCMC as I realised I didn’t add that before. The building is a guest house but the ground floor is covered in yellow flowers and flags so may be a religious site

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to add that things are rarely black and white, and parents rarely abuse their children for their own pleasures.
 Most parents genuinely love their children and family. And you can see that they themselves are victims of toxic parenting and they themselves suffer from the mental trauma that they don't know. We can try to convince them that their way of parenting is wrong but with generations upon generations of trauma and "tradition brainwashing" (so to speak), coupled with the lack of Vietnamese language resources, it's really hard for them to realize that the traditional way of parenting is damaging to the mental health of their children.
 So it's up to us the younger generations who are equipped with better knowledge to break the cycle, be more understanding to our children at the same time try to fix our own mental trauma so that we don't fall into the old ways.

 Kind greetings from Ireland.
 I am an Irish American man in my mid twenties. I am currently considering relocating to Vietnam in early 2024 for a minimum of 1 year. I am considering teaching either or both PE (physical education) and English. Currently I have a bachelor's degree in Exercise science and I am shortly die to complete my masters in strength and conditioning. I also have TEFL 120hrs certificate. 
 I don't have any specific question, I am more just looking for advice and insight to what life could potentially be like for me.

 I’m a huge history fan, and I have studied Vietnamese history for many years.
 Soon I idol be visiting Vietnam for the second time, and I would love to know where I can go to buy antiques in Vietnam. I’m not interested in replicas. Especially war replicas. I will be in many different cities. I have heard there are certain “if you know where to go” places you can get some nice antiques, so I would love to know where to look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking at traveling to Northern VietNam (Hanoi) in December. For some context, I live in Canada, will be traveling solo, and am looking at going through a couple weeks. 
  
After doing some research, it seems that one of the biggest challenges is getting around VietNam. Alot of posts say the best way to get around is by motorcycle, however I don't have a motorcycle license nor do I know how to ride a motorcycle. With motorcycle out of the picture, what is the next best way to get around?
 One thing I've found from traveling to other places is you save $$$ when you book tours through the street vendors and not through the airline/travel agency. Are there street vendors in VietNam that you can walk up to and book a tour right then and there, or is it better to book them beforehand? I've seen a few websites selling travel excursions in VietNam.
 Almost all the excursions to Ha Long Bay I've found include an overnight cruise. Being December (one of the worst months for rough seas) and someone who gets sea sick easily, is it possible to go on a boat for a few hours and head back to Hanoi on the same day? Or is it better to spend the night somewhere around Ha Long Bay?
 What would be a good way to get to Sa Pa? Google says it's ~5 hours by car and ~7 hours by train. Similar to Ha Long Bay, is it recommended/possible to stay in Sa Pa overnight?
 Any other recommendations?

I have a little to none motorcycle experience but she has not (we skate and cycle tho so we're pretty agile, also plan on maybe practice a bit on a motorcylce there and see how comfortable we are). Is it do-able or really as bad as they say? My way of thinking is just that if the road gets tricky we'll just slow down take our time and watch out, or even do part by foot. If it's just not possible to do it on a motorbike, can you do it by car or (part) on foot, is it still worth it then?

She says I’ll get more money that way. I’m a little nervous about getting ripped off because its very obvious I’m a foreigner. Would I even get more money? Also if I wanted to buy a jewelry while I’m there, how often do you get sold fakes? I know nothing about jewelry and I feel like I could easily get dupped. Maybe I’m just too suspicious but she seems to think I’d get more of my moneys worth in Vietnam.

I have had all the vaccines my government says are essential, but there are some that are up to yourself to determine if you need them. These are the vaccines for rabies, japanese encephalitus and malaria. I tried asking in travel forums, but they say "ask your doctor", which I obviously already have, but it is up to me to determine these three on my own.
 What do you think is necessary? I am travelling throughout the country, National Parks, trekking in the northern region, but mostly tourist places.

By the end she said after the treatment you gonna look so beautiful im gonna introduce someone to you. Like i cant get a guy by myself or i need to change anything about myself to get a guy. I talked to another girl earlier i said im not sure i want to have kids, she said im so short sided.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most men I've met and talked to disapproved of them, saying that they're way too effeminate. 
 Do most Vietnamese men hold the same opinion? I mean, Vietnam, or any Asian country for that matter, is heavily affected by Korea entertainment industry. Korea, in itself, is a kingdom and trend-setter in terms of entertainment and beauty, it's no doubt we are somewhat influenced by them. Most of our hairstyles, or fashion styles, right now follows what's trendy in Korea, which would affect what Vietnamese choose to wear and what clothes are produced and promoted for men fashion. 
 I've heard Vietnamese men complaining complaining endlessly on Facebook too, wondering why women likes such girly boys. But I think if they don't have any appeal at all to women, they won't be that successful and loved. Maybe what men thinks women find attractive is drastically different than what women actually find attractive.
 For me, as a gay men and somewhat masculine, I find half of them very pleasing to the eyes, very "pretty", the other half too effeminate for my taste. They are "beautiful", but not "hot." But it depends on which idol though, some has a perfect blend of masculinity and feminity, of handsomeness and gracefulness that makes them hotter than any 6-packs Western bros.
 Do Vietnamese men like the image of male K-pop idols?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never understood people's obsession with having a son, a male heir. My father, for example, abandoned his previous wives because they couldn't bring him a son. It was not until my mother, and not until having 5 daughters prior to having me, did he have a son.
 But sadly, that son, which is me, is gay. Don't you think it's ironic? The way my father was obsessed with having a son, and he turned out to be gay? I guess it's his karma. Never mind, he abandoned my mother too and he has never existed to me in my mind.
 It's just that a family in my neighborhood, who are really poor, they have three young daughters already and they're still pushing for another one in hope it's a boy. Watching the mother with a big belly and three daughters already barely having enough to eat and study pains my heart. 
 Why the obsession with having to have a boy? Um, he could be gay, you know? He could be a transgender. He could die young? He could be a drug addict and a failure, in which case you must have 3 or 4 sons in case then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the midst of crazy public holiday traffic last night I jumped out of a Grab when I could not knowing my phone slipped from me while doing so, and by the time I realised and ran back he was gone. As a solo traveller it was daunting to think what I should do and what I couldn't do without my phone. Trying not to panic, I went to the nearby security guard of a mall. He understood the gist of what I said and took me to the mall information desk. Now, I assumed in the crowded noisy and busy place they would just wave me away and say go to the police station or something. But they jumped into action, got my details and number (thank f*** I had my Vietnam phone number written down seperately on hand), took my photo and messaged security to go over CCTV to try to get the car plate number, let me use their phone to see if I could get any Grab details from my email, and kept calling my phone when they could. 
 The CCTV couldn't get a plate number. I feared the driver wouldn't hear my phone or would just keep it, but eventually the driver answers. He had finished for the day but would drive back, although it would take time with all the traffic. I expected he would want a compensation for time and fuel and honesty, but when he eventually arrived he refused the cash in my hand. I made him accept a bag of those holiday moon cake things the mall was selling as a thank you, and I also went back and bought a couple for the information desk ladies afterwards. 
 This is a simple faith in humanity restored post because I feared the worst and was touched by how much they cared, especially at such a busy working time for them, for some tourist. Caring for others makes a difference.

 Chinese ain't that tall and their scrawny looking military appears extremely funny versus the US. So why the hate? Explain.

Anything from candies, to souvenirs, gifts for my wife, etc. Ideally links would be great too! I'll be in Saigon if that makes any difference. 
 Thanks so much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These people live maybe a few years in Nam, get stepped on in a crowded elevator at rush hour and scream 'selfish culture' at the top of their lung. They get cut on the road by other bikes at rush hour where everyone just want to get home in a traffic jam and scream. 
 While those behavior can be labeled selfish, they made up one small part of one side of the knife. People will go out of their way to hold the elevator door open for me everyday, and im a man. If you ran out of gas and pushing your bike on the road, it wont take long until someone stop and ask, even drive off and buy you a can. 
 It's not to say Vietnamese people are not selfish for doing those thing. It's to say they act on the polar opposite on different circumstance. So those examples doesnt really say anything about the culture itself.

 Last night was super busy in the city, with all the streets closed off, wasn't expecting that (cause it's the night before?) but it was nice. My guidebook states that there is a parade with fireworks somewhere, but my host wasn't aware of this. Maybe you guys know? It'll be my last day in Vietnam so it would be nice to end it off with some celebration.

 I have around 21-22 days. Plannint to fly out of Hanoi. 
 I want to explore the major places, I know, its not possible to explore this big country in just 3 weeks.
 Plan is to see HCMC, Museums, Cu chi tunnel. Explore the street food. Then visit da nang/Hoi an and do activities there. Bana hills, eat good food. 
 Then move to Hanoi. Then Ninh bin. 1 day trip to Lan ha bay. 2 days to Sapa fom Hanoi. 
 I am not going to Ha xiang region. Just want to see Sapa.
 I want to try the sleeper night trains from Saigon to Danang. Is it worth or better to book the flight or bus? Are the buses comfortable enough to sleep?
 Also, please tell me which bank ATM has zero cost on cash withdrawal?
 If I purchase eletronic items like Phone/Drone etc, will I get VAT refund at the airport? How much vat refund can I get ?
 Thanks.

We're deciding on whether to go through the process but cost is a major issue. In the US it costs $30k per procedure. We've considered either going back to France where IVF can be done for $5k or Vietnam. I've seen VN fertility clinics that will do the procedure for $3k to $5k. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Không biết ở đây có ai nắm rõ về lịch sử không, nhưng tôi khá là tò mò về vấn đề này:
 Nhìn theo mốc thời gian, giai đoạn này chữ Quốc Ngữ đã tồn tại, thậm chí còn có cả báo ra bằng chữ Quốc Ngữ (Gia Định báo, 1865).
 Hai cuộc chiến tranh Nha Phiến đã kết thúc (1860). Pháp đã chiếm xong Lục Tỉnh (1867). Về lý thuyết, dường như không lạ nếu có người Việt nhìn ra sức mạnh của phương Tây bấy giờ so với triều đình nhà Nguyễn. Điều này căn bản không khác gì lối suy nghĩ của Duy Tân Minh Trị ở Nhật Bản lúc bấy giờ cả. Nhưng thực tế thì theo ghi chép lịch sử có ai như vậy ở Việt Nam, nhất là khu vực phía Bắc không?
 Đồng thời, phong trào Văn Thân từ năm 1864 đã có, khởi nguồn cũng ở miền Bắc, Trung. Bình Tây, sát tả nhắm vào người Công Giáo, nhưng khó có thể phủ nhận còn giết hại cả những người không theo Công Giáo (lương dân) thân Pháp, nhất là sau biến cố Bắc Kỳ (1873).
 Vậy giai đoạn ở giữa thì sao? Có bất cứ ghi chép gì về sự tồn tại của một ai đó đã bắt đầu tiến hành Tây học vào giai đoạn này không? Nếu có thì cách nhìn của xã hội với (những) người này như thế nào?

 There are plenty of examples of words that were from the French and I was curious if this was one of them. Amidan to me just doesn't sound Viet.. but hey.. I could be wrong.

I feel happier when I’m with my viet family, I feel more at home with them than in the US, and am welcome to live with them when I am there (I think this is legal if I register with police). We are visiting soon again and I will consult people when I visit but was wondering if I’d be able to take some capital from the US and open a business over there. It seems like you have to invest a certain threshold, aka be a big time corporate investor where I’m trying to start a smaller business. I would appreciate the inputs.

 Let's say, he came unprepared. He was shocked and scarred for life, lol. His expectation of what's considered cold was vastly different to how cold it was actually. He barely brought any practical jackets to keep himself warm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm curious and just wanted to hear more about how English teachers in Vietnam felt and managed while in Vietnam. I've selected Vietnam as my first teaching destination.
 -Monthly income? What did you actually make as an entry level teacher?
 -How many days did you really work each week? Was it exhausting? Start time & End time.
 -I plan to take Vietnamese language classes during my free time. Will I have time outside of work for languages classes?
 -What's the most efficient way to learn Vietnamese from scratch? I know its extremely difficult to learn. My goal is to at least be about to speak like a Vietnamese toddler after 1.5 years of practice.
 I'm also very introverted and at times a little closed off. I just have to fight that habit I have of isolating myself. Idk why I love alone time so much haha. But overall I have positive interactions with almost everyone and Im pretty approachable. I hope to come across people from all walks of life while in Vietnam. My parents are Nigerian but I was born in America so I got to experience two cultures growing up. I just love learning about other cultures.
 Lastly, how's dating/making friends scene in Vietnam?? I would like a social life. 
 Is a long term stay feasible as an English teacher in Vietnam? Or at all as an English's teacher. I do hold a Masters degree, Im hoping that helps with future promotions after I gather more teaching experience. What do you think?
 I'm also a Registered Nurse in America. Im 35 years old. Im 6'3 and Black. Would I do best in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh?
 Advice, honest opinions and experiences are all welcomed.

I figure I can stick to seafood and vegetarian options, but wondered if anyone had experience trying to eat halal or kosher (as I know both these follow a strict 'no pork' criteria) while in Vietnam.
 Thanks in advance :)
 ​
 Edit: Thank you to everyone who has offered advice. It's been extremely helpful as I was really worried I would be limited in experiencing the delicious cuisine. I will be taking u/meh2280 on his suggestion that bun cha is worth it - I just got some meds from the doc so I can limit my diarrhea to just a day or two and only eat it on days where we will be staying around our accommodation and relaxing! haha sorry if that was TMI. 
 Special thanks to those of you who also translated some food names into english for me. This is going to serve me well. I can't wait to go to Vietnam! :)

I told them that it’s not funny, the dog was clearly scared and the man was being abusive (about to hit them with a sandal), and they told me I’m being too sensitive, that it’s only a joke…
 Why do viet people have such shit sense of humor though…

 I saw some people spraying in Hanoi earlier today and they told me I can do it on the wall near the Waterpark in Tây Hồ but I saw its filled with really nice murals and I don't really wanna spray over them 😂 I've only done this once before so I am just looking for an ugly ass wall where I can practice making ugly drawings
 Also would be interested in creating paste-ups (posters), what are the regulations on those? Can I get in trouble if I paste some art on walls around the city?

 My friend said, look at him! I only said back "Đẹp trai!" My friend then gave me a very weird look, then saying that don't ever use "Đẹp trai" to compliment a guy, we are only allowed to use "Ngầu".
 Which is weird to me. Maybe I'm being gay so I'm not used to the normal customs and etiquettes between guys and guys. Maybe I see no problem with it but many do. Is it socially unacceptable for Vietnamese men to compliment each other using "Đẹp trai", or that word is just avoided and reserved for only women to use to compliment a guy?

fake account pretending to be a tourist and posting links toward their tourism website
 post contains nothing but a tiktok link with no context
 literally same as above, but youtube link to their own channel
  
this wholesome sub is the last place i want to see people abusing for their own profit

Mortgage of banks is a big issue too nowadays, rate around 10% are literally madness to borrow any amount of money. Please give me your opinions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào! I recently started my journey of learning Vietnamese in the northern dialect. I've seen a few different people say that it's always helpful to consume some sort of media in your target language to familiarize yourself with the sounds and pronunciation, even if you don't understand anything. This of course isn't going to be my primary method of studying but I'm sure it would be a useful tool, especially with English subtitles but that isn't a requirement. Does anyone have suggestions for something I could use that is mainly in the northern accent? I can listen to podcasts/radio shows at work, or it could be content creators or TV shows/movies for in my free time. I would appreciate any ideas! Cảm ơn (:

 Here is the issue I have. My mother name Anh Thi Nguyễn which Anh is first name and Nguyễn is her last name. On her passport and Visa, it says Given Name Thi Anh and last name is Nguyễn, so combined is Thi Anh Nguyễn. 
 When I booked, I put last name Nguyễn, first name Anh, middle name Thi, ticket comes out with traveler name is Anh Thi Nguyễn. 
 I found out I cannot change anything. Will this be an issue when she flies with custom? 
 Thank you everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a white guy (Ukranian ancestry and American born) and live in Southern California and I recently rented a room from a Vietnamese family. Very nice people, I've only spoken to them briefly but they seem really nice and it's a great room and beautiful, quiet house!
 The wife of the family has been hard with me though...they were renting a room to somebody before that was there for 6 years, and I'm "the new renter" and she has been getting on my case for stuff that's pretty obviously just to give me a hard time and probably to test me a bit and see how I'll react perhaps? I'm not sure. She keeps telling me that if she doesn't like me that she'll just tell her husband and that they won't let me live there. 
 The husband has been very laid back for the most part, it seems like she is just testing me somewhat and wants to make sure I'm a nice person and a good renter. 
 Anyway, I wanted to ask is there some kind of gift I can get for her or the family that would show my appreciation to the family for renting the room? I'm fairly new to SoCal which has a large Vietnamese population as I'm sure you know, and I'd like to get the something as a housewarming gift and to show my appreciation.
 Thanks in advance, much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During our stay in Vietnam, when we were asked where we come from, we noticed some curious pattern:
 -Greece
 -[questioning look]
 -Hy Lap
 -Aaaah, Hy Lap. Pyramids!
 -No, that is Egypt. We are the others, the ones with the columns. XD
 So, most usually people confused Greece with Egypt. It’s not insulting for us or anything like that but I really wonder why that mix-up was so common. I understand that an obscure, small, rather insignificant country in the other end of the world can be mixed up with other, neighboring countries. But why specifically with Egypt?
 My suspicion is that most Vietnamese have heard of Greece in history class at school. Maybe in chapter "ancient civilizations of eastern Mediterranean"? (That’s when Greece was thriving)
 Please help me untangle this mystery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, do any of you have specific recommendations for places to visit in the south during mid September? The weather is due to be wet, but it doesn't deter me. I will travel from Saigon to Hanoi from September 10-31st and am truly excited. I have plenty of places I'd like to visit in the middle/north such as Hue, Hoi An, Sapa and Phong Nha. However, I lack destinations in the south that may be worth visiting this time of year, apart from Saigon and Dalat. I have searched for places to visit, but am concerned that they won't be too enjoyable in wet weather. Is there anywhere in the south people found particularly beautiful in September? Many thanks in advance👍

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am at work today so I gave my family my cards in case they need to buy anything (they come to visit me). I put £1000 on the card. For all days I kept receiving notifications with money caming out from my card. And when contacted them, they informed me that they were buying perfumes, cosmetics and wines.
 The annoying part is that they didn't even spend the money for themselves. They spent it to buy souvenirs for people I don’t even know and they didn't even meet once every couple of months. My sister bought gifts for her mother-in-law’s neighbours, my niece bought gifts for her classmates. I already bought lots of cosmetics and functional foods for my sisters and cousins at home so there isn't much they need to buy. I already covered the expenses of the whole trip, so with this It feels like I am even paying for people who didn't even do anything for my life.
 The culture of buying gifts for everyone when travelling is something I couldn't understand. They didn't even contribute one penny when we work our ashes out to afford holiday. Why do we have to buy them gifts when we enjoy the sweet fruit of our labour?

 The game titles I often play:
  
League of Legends (Mostly in Aram mode, I've reached Grandmaster rank as an ADC)
 Valorant
 Honkai Star Rail
 Genshin Impact
 I can play various games on Steam that support co-op mode.
 I'm fond of narrative-driven games like Cyberpunk 2077, Batman Trilogy, Final Fantasy...
  
I use Discord and I prefer playing games at home.
 I hope to find someone who would like to play with me after stressful working hours. 
 I am indeed a real girl. I'm not transgender or anything like that. It's just that my gaming hobby and skills aren't common in my job and profession. I'm also pursuing a master's degree, so I don't have time to find gaming buddies. I've spent a lot of money to hire gaming partners, but I've realized that those relationships can be quite toxic.

 I have come to understand that Vietnam has very strict laws against the usage of marijuana, but that these laws are rarely enforced. I am a foreigner - an American, and the situation is much the same in many parts of the country here. In addition to this, there has been a fairly constant push amongst some people to legalize marijuana here, and it seems likely to me that it will be made federally legal some time in the relatively near future (though I don't think the country is quite there yet). I was curious if it is the same for Vietnam - what is the general sentiment on marijuana laws? Do you believe marijuana should be legal in Vietnam, and do you think it will be soon, or do you think the current laws will remain in place for the foreseeable future, and why?

 My brother-in-law (26M) has been dating this Vietnamese girl (27F) for almost a year now. I’m a Vietnamese myself so it’s not a racial targeted post.
 Well… When they first started dating, I’ve noticed some red flags in the stories he told me and my husband about. Since maybe he was just trying to vent to us, I’m not gonna mention them. But that’s when I began to have bad feelings about this girl.
 A month or two into them seeing each other, he found out that she’s actually STILL MARRIED to another man and had a kid with him. When they met up to talk about it, she explained that her husband had a child with another …]]></summary>

What are the VN foodies thoughts on this place? Normally $80-$125 tasting menu pricing isn’t that big of a deal in the west, but I feel I can better spend that money elsewhere. I had the million Dong pho from LM81 and thought it was a solid 7/10, but wouldn’t go out of my way to eat there again. 
 Also, how far in advance do I need to make reservations? Thank you.

 I am planning my trip to vietnam next month. I will go with one of my friend which is VN. We will stay in his village (Đức thắng mộ Đức quảng Ngãi)for one week at his parents house.
 Problem is: he told me that in the past the military have forbidden foreingers to stay and sleep the night in this village. Apparently for 'security' reason because of some military zone nearby. We would have to book hotel nearby and visit his family during the day. Problem is that I do not find any official information on this interdiction and what are the exact restrictions. I would like to know the laws/rules so that I am not putting myself into problems.
 Questions: Are you aware of any official restrictions for foreigners in certain part of vietnam? Any forbiden place or activity related to military area?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, everyone!
 I am very excited to be going to Vietnam for the first time on October 5th of this year. I am meeting my best friend who's been living in Germany for the last 8 months. It's going to be a fairly quick trip, and neither of us knows the best way to go about it.
 As it stands, we are meeting in HCM and we have a total of 16 days before I need to fly back from HCM to Australia on the 21st. Currently, we're thinking of spending 8 days in HCM and then another 8 days in Hanoi, as Google says Hoi An will have bad weather. I wouldn't mind going to Sapa as that looks good too, but I'm at a complete loss as to what to do and where to go.
 I have some general concerns as this will be my first time overseas from Australia and im not too sure what to expect. 
 with that out the way the only solid plans I have are landing in HCM on the 5th of Oct and flying out on the night of the 21st. Any advice would be appreciated. Also, I just want to make sure I don't make any rookie travel mistakes during that time. I know there are massive differences in weather across the country during that period and Im mostly just looking to find the driest / sunniest place to go that time of year. Apologies in advance im just a bit confused as every website I see gives different advice and wildly different weather predictions. 
 Thanks!

When I visited Vietnam a month ago, I thought people were mostly friendly, ( although a Belgian traveler I met said that he was denied entry to restaurants on a couple of occasions ) and the country was far more beautiful ( nature ) than I expected. Mostly the countryside in Ninh Binh. How many of you live in the countryside in Vietnam ? Do you enjoy it or does or get boring quick enough ?

I’m very introverted person and need time alone. Is this level of communication typical in Vietnamese relationships? He is very keen on me committing to the relationship even though I just met him. I don’t know if I’m comfortable with this style of relationship. He has respected my boundaries but I do feel overwhelmed and unsure about my feelings for him. What I should expect dating a Vietnamese man? All the guides I see are about foreigners dating a Vietnamese woman.

 I'm aware I would need to do a border run every 1/3 months depending on how the visa situation develops. Living somewhat frugally, eating what the locals do, but still having pretty regular nights out on the town.
 Roughly how long do you think I should plan to stay there? Thank
 Edit: I definitely meant to put 500 million, sorry about that folks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an (obvious) "western" tourist here, I often have the feeling you cannot walk more than 50 meters without someone approaching you who is after your money (especially in cities). In principle that's fine, it's natural that a lot of people earn money from tourists and have to approach them, so I do not mind. However this leads to me getting used to say "no" to basically everyone taking to me. 
 Today I was walking to the post office (~20 min away) in HCMC with postcards in my hand, and someone driving by (regular guy, no grab jacket or anything) stopped and asked if I was looking for the post office and if he could help me. Out of habit I immediately told him no thanks, but afterwards reflected if I was being mean to someone genuinely wanting to help.
 Similar situations happened several times... So my question: am I being naive, is anyone offering help expecting a tip/money anyways? ( I was also asked for money straight away after someone helped me with a minor think taking 20 second, with rather ungrateful response after I gave only 20k.) Or am I being mean to people and assume they are just after money if they are genuinely nice? And how can you tell the difference?
 My common sense from "back home" does not really seem to apply here, hence my questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm staying in Hanoi for about two months to do research at VAST. Of course I am taking this opportunity to visit as much places as possible here. But since I have so much time I was wondering if there are places worth visiting that are less obvious or well known, that tourists don't usually visit because they're too far from the center or something like that. Does anyone have recommendations?

From the moment I landed (4.00 am), I am seeing people roaming around with flower bouquets in scooters, this was early morning. Day time when I was roaming hanoi old quarters, I saw many women carrying those white flower bouquets. Is it some occasion? Or it is customary to give your date a bouquet of white flowers?

 Apparently there are groups on Facebook where Vietnamese women either shame men they are not happy with or use it to warn other women off a man they are interested in.
 Can anyone verify this? Also, I am assuming that they are private groups that guys can’t Peruse

There’s always tons of food so I don’t think I should bring food. There’s always tons of beer so I don’t think I need to bring that either. Last time I brought some flowers. I keep worrying I might accidentally offend them but they keep inviting me so I don’t think I have. We live in America. I’m trying to learn a little Vietnamese but it’s really difficult—will they think it’s weird if I try to say something in Vietnamese? Edit: I’m getting the impression that more beer is alway welcome!
 Edit 2: definitely bringing Hennessy and fruit. Probably not bull penis that someone suggested.

I have been looking for hotel options not too far from the old quarter who either have private parking for guests. All the hotels that I have checked out on Agoda that has car park listed as a facility, don't really have a parking lot in front when I cross checked them on Google Maps. A bit confused right now on how I should go about searching a hotel that meets this criteria, or alternatively should I be looking at paid parking lots and if those are common in Hanoi. 
 Any suggestion/recommendation is highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me, it's the best beach I've ever had the chance to visit. But I've only visited Ha Long Bay and Sam Son Beach, and Sam Son has not exactly ever been recommended by anyone, so I think my opinion might be skewed 
 I love visiting Ha Long bay. I, in fact, has been doing it all the times, alone. I'm afraid it's just sentimental reasons though, It's just that have treasurable memory there. It was a very difficult time of my life, and someone invited me to go there with them. I remember just lying on the golden sand, gazing my eyes up on the blue blue sky, immerse myself into what felt like just emptyless. A big, blue sky and a boderless sea, just made you felt wanting to melting into them, merging with them, disappear into just some bubbles with them. Just plain peace and tranquillity, some tranquillity I deeply needed that time. It calmed me down, calmed my every torments down.
 From then, I always make chances to go there, just to lie on the golden sand again. I only chose when there would be least tourists, even if that means during a storm season. Storm, brings in another kind of tranquillity. 
 But I'm afraid I might be biased. I always tell people that in Vietnam, I love Ha Long the most. I'm afraid the reason I love Ha Long is not for the fact it's actually great there. To gaze into the endless sky, any beach would do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm planning on visiting Vietnam in the second half of September and want to get an idea of what kind of weather to expect. I tried googling it and got some very different answers so I thought I'd try asking the people who actually live there. Should I bring gumboots and a raincoat, or boardshorts and sunglasses?
 Is there a noticeable difference in weather between the north/central/south regions?

After making several short films he finally made KFC (2016), his feature film debut, three years later. In 2023, he released two movies, “Rock-a-bye Baby” and “Jackpot Island”

 Is there certain clubs(not partying/drinking clubs) I can join to meet new people? Or online groups or apps to use/download? How does the Vietnamese-American Center in Saigon work? I’d love to visit.
 Thanks in advance 🙏

There was also one time the vet in district 2, saigon asked us if we rescued our dog. What are your thoughts on this? Maybe I am missing something or having a viet dog is considered as a rescue act for foreigners here in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this could be a controversial topic, but I really need to get this out there so we can hear each other's opinion.
 I have had a motorbike driving license for 8 years. My bike is reaching 30,000 km traveled intra-city. I've got used to the bustling metropolitan lifestyle.
 But I cannot trust my life on the bike. I've realized my body is out on the open, and each day it's like large cars are out there to get me. During rush hour, the sidewalk is the road. I cannot help but feel guilty for pedestrians who should have the right to the sidewalk, but again, my right of way is being violated by the cars too. City traffic IS deadly if you're a biker, I cannot say otherwise.
 Why allowing such a risky vehicle to become the nation's top chosen transport? Why putting next to none effort in enforcing helmet safety? Why aborting the trolleycars, a totally cool public transport?
 I really need to hear your thoughts.
 Disclaimer: I am not a foreigner. I've lived all my life in Vietnam and married to a third generation Hanoian family, whose members are exclusively chauffered or taking public transport, and advise me to stay out of traffic.

 As u all know, Trump and co-conspirator's mugshots were finally released yesterday and i read a report by vnexpress on this and the comment section is absolutely filled with fanatic Trump supporters, which is kinda strange and disturbing to me since i expect an isolationist president like Trump will not gather as much support in foreign countries, not to mention all of the horrible deeds he had done during and after his presidency( covid response and Jan 6th, etc)
 So just how popular is Trump in this country? Are those comments just trolls or actual opinions of actual Vietnameses?

 Common solution is to find the teacher and give him a chair on the head, but after the anger subsided I think maybe there could be more civilized way to solve this?
 Plan to take him to the hospital for checkups first thing tomorrow, but anyone has suggestions on what we should do? Google only give vague advices that doesn’t help much.

 These toilets tend to have bad water pressure, so I got to thinking while stinking.
 Am I supposed to: 1. Spray and toss the hopefully dookie-less paper into the bin? 2. Not throw PAPER TOWEL into the toilet, but TP is fair play?
 This has been bothering me for years. 
 This is much more ambiguous than "don't stand on the toilet seat" and "don't spray water into the power outlets"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a person who loves Vietnam very much and has traveled here many times. My favorite destination is the sea in Vietnam, and I have discovered many beautiful beaches suitable for relaxation. Here are the top beautiful beaches in Vietnam that I would recommend:
 1. Lang Co Beach, Hue
 https://preview.redd.it/pwikjgdh37kb1.jpg?width=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1c23e31562a1a517529d1b6210d53dd76dd40f5
 This is my favorite beach. Lang Co Beach is very clean and beautiful, as well as having a wild beauty. I am a person who does not like beaches that are too crowded with tourists and are interfered with by travel companies or resorts, so this is an ideal place for those who love natural beauty.
 2. My Khe Beach, Da Nang
 https://preview.redd.it/inksi4zs47kb1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d44aeb8b8290eecbb18e5bd35d44ad093bd842e5
 Although it is pretty crowded with tourists, the scenery is still beautiful, and there are many exciting activities on the sea that you can participate in, such as playing volleyball, surfing, or. I highly recommend the Paragliding service Paragliding in Da Nang. Should join once in a lifetime to admire the city scenery and enjoy the beauty of Da Nang from above.
 3. Mui Ne Beach
 https://preview.redd.it/2tzaoes737kb1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b9b48b16c9be0969a10ce85e79b64b51503ee36
 Mui Ne is suitable for resort tourism, with luxurious 5-star resorts along the coast. Mui Ne Beach will give you a feeling of peace, not hustle.
 There are also many beautiful beaches in Vietnam that you can refer to in the Top 10 beautiful beaches in Vietnam. I rate the shores of Vietnam as very beautiful, and next time I will evaluate some coastal resorts for those who intend to go to the beach for reference.

 I'll be visiting HCMC and Hanoi in October, and have a few questions that I'm hoping someone here can help me with. 
  
Do any of the teams have HQs or retails shops that I could visit, similar to T1's setup in Seoul? Ideally Hanoi, as I'm only in HCMC for 2 days. 
 
If not team retail shops, any idea where I can buy some team kit from other retail shops? I really like the GAM shirts, but happy to support any/all teams. 
 
Any idea if there will be Worlds 2023 viewing parties in Hanoi? English-speaking?
 
 Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My fiancé and I will be traveling to Saigon for December/January for our wedding and would love to see some Vietnamese artists in concert! (Thinking like tlinh, MONO, GREY D, MIN, W/N, Suboi, Binz, Orange, Hoàng Dũng, etc.) While he was born there, he’s been in the US for a while so he isn’t sure the best place to search. Okay if the website is in Vietnamese since he can help translate. Thank you, cảm ơn!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my Vietnamese friend is going to open his new store next week, and he invited me (Chinese but born and raised in Germany) to take part in the prayers. He told me because my age is auspicious and will bring good luck to the new store. I myself is not religious and the asian tradition is unfamiliar to me so I would like to know more what this is all about, thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am half Vietnamese (born and raised in US) and am trying to get in touch with my Vietnamese side.
 My mother fled from the war when she was very young, so a lot of our family’s traditions and cultures have been lost on my side. 
 A lot of my female family wears jade wrist bangles and other jade jewelry. I was wondering if there is something similar to this permanent jewelry that men wear? I love the idea of wearing a jade bangle, but from my understanding it is something meant for women rather than me. I was unable to find information about this topic from Google, so I am asking here. 
 Thanks!

I’ll be in SEA for three months and, to me, that sounds excessive. Is this a necessary precaution or is there another option?

 Does anyone have a solution? Would even consider by sea.
