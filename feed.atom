        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I ask because I've seen quite a few articles about how extremely easily-offended many Vietnamese immigrant communities, especially in Seattle and throughout California and Texas, are when they see the modern flag, equating it with the Confederate and Nazi flags, and have forced many institutions to use the traditional yellow one instead.
 I kinda wonder if it's as serious as local news outlets say it is or if it's all gross exaggerations that inadvertently make the Vietnamese community look bad. Because taken to the logical extreme, it would mean Hardee's/Carl's Jr and Steven Universe would be protested against or banned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Am I getting scammed?
 Staying in nha Trang, at one of the large hotels. They said they can organise motorbike rental for me, and 10min later there was one at reception! I handed over my passport and money to the pair who delivered the bike and exchanged numbers. 
 I have the bike, it's good brand and good condition.
 I'm suddenly freaking out because I received no paperwork and signed nothing. I don't even know what company it is.
 The hotel organised it which made me feel safe, but now I'm not sure.
 Is this just the way it is in Vietnam? Very laid back re paperwork etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just had to renew my US passport today after finding it damaged. The Embassy says it typically takes 2 weeks to process. My flight out of Vietnam is in 3 weeks. I have a visa in my old passport (expired) and a TRC connected to the old passport that's valid for another year. Will I be able to leave Vietnam without issue if I bring both passports and the TRC to the airport or do I need to have an exit visa? I'm worried I won't have enough time to get the exit visa by the time my new passport is finished. Any insight would be very appreciated!
 ​
 Sorry if it's a stupid question! I'm just worried about getting in some sort of trouble at the airport.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am obsessed with Vietnam and have been dying to move over for years. I had flights ready before COVID hit, which lasted so long I decide to study a postgraduate degree instead of waiting around. 
 I want to rent an apartment by myself and fly my 2 cats over with me and study Vietnamese alongside working. I'm serious about this move and immersing myself in the culture. I intend on staying for a few years and working on legal visas.
 I have a first class Honours Degree in Fine Art, experience of exhibiting of my own work, experience teaching geography GCSE and currently in my second full-time placement as an art teacher in a UK secondary school. I will graduate from my PGCE in secondary Art and Design in July 2023, which would make me a fully qualified British curriculum high school art teacher. I don't want to stick around the UK to work for two years before moving... which would secure a top end international school job. 
 I understand secondary art teaching jobs are few and far between especially for a teacher with less than 2 years experience. If I move to Vietnam (even if it's initially as an English teacher) would I eventually find work in this sector? What kind of jobs, monthly income and hours would I be looking at if I move and then find a job in this sector after arrival -even if I have to resort to English teaching for a while.
 I'm so excited for the move but it is a huge move and pretty nerve wracking! A big goal for me is to strike a balance between progressing with my teaching career and also my independent art practice! 
 I'd love to hear about your experiences and advice; you thoughts and feelings. 🍵🇻🇳

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically, renting a bike and riding from HCMC to Hanoi later this year.
 Planning to rent either a Honda Blade or Honda XR150. The dates I will be travelling are from 24th Oct to the the 4th of November. 
 So I have currently planned 10 days of riding.
 Day 1: HCMC to Cat Tien Day 2: Cat Tien to Dalat Day 3: Dalat to Phan Thiet Day 4: Phan Thiet to Nha Trang Day 5: Nha Trang to Mang den Day 6: Mang Den to Hoi an Day 7: Hoi an to Hue Day 8: Hue to Phong Nha Day 9: Phong Nha to Mai chau Day 10: Mai Chau to Hanoi
 Now here is my dilemma. I am very time restricted and only have 12 full days to complete this ride. Is it possible to do this? Am I an idiot for even considering this? Will I make it in time considering weather etc? I am a very experienced rider, so riding in the rain does not bother me, but will floods and such stop me? Any recommendations or considerations would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I hope you're all doing well. 
 I am used to solo traveling, and sometimes I schedule solo trips for my birthday to celebrate it on a different way. Every time I did this I had an amazing time with the people I met randomly during the trips! 
 This year I've chosen to do this in Vietnam and I was thinking on spending this day on a 2-days cruise to Ha Long Bay. My other options are Hanoi itself or maybe Da Nang. I am, however, scared that these cruises are full of closed groups or families and I end up having a not-so-pleasant experience. 
 For those who did this already, what do you think? Is there any other alternative you strongly suggest? Side note: turning 33. 
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The highlight from my trip was the warm reception from almost everybody we met.
 The lowlight was the challenge to find good vegetarian food easily. Maybe it was first trip and so we were struggling to find the non-meat options but we did found some options online which I kind of became our thing for the rest of the trip.

I’m not a super extroverted person so this is uncharted territories for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to Vietnam for 2 weeks in May, I’m just looking for some ideas on how to fill my time being there. 
 My basic itinerary is the following
 Flying into Hanoi and going straight to Halong bay for 3 days Going back to Hanoi for 3 days Flying to Ho Chi Minh for 3 days Flying to Da Nang for 3 days 
 I’m going with my partner but she’s there for work for the first few days in Halong and we’re meeting in Hanoi 3 days later. 
 Just looking for some ideas on the solo 3 days in Halong for a somewhat adventurous guy, I plan on doing a day cruise and a Hike but don’t know how to fill the other couple days there. 
 I enjoy architecture and scenery I plan to enjoy in Hanoi, but any must sees would be amazing to hear. 
 The Ho Chi Minh trip I plan on doing the walking street and unsure how to fill the other days. 
 Da Nang I plan on doing the hands bridge and enjoying the beach I think doing the marble mountain as well and doing a trip to Hà Nội as well. 
 Any input, on how to fill the days is greatly appreciated!

He went to highschool here, speaks the language, goes to university and soon will be eligible for a citizenship here. To get it, he needs to renounce the Vietnamese citizenship but he told me that it can be a very long and difficult process. Does anyone have experience with it? Is it really that difficult?
 Another thing - he has not done the military training and is not planning to as he wants to spend his life in Latvia. But he has to go to Vietnam this summer to renew his ID. I'm worried he might get into trouble for avoiding the training so I'm quite worried about him going there. Can anyone give me some insight on this?

Every single one of them, it reeks of a tourist trap. Does anyone here have experience with the area, are there any tours without these worthless tourist attractions? Have you negotiated with the boat drivers to take you somewhere else?

 Of course 2 weeks are not enough to see all those beautiful spots/things, but I have a very detailed itinerary I prepared myself and I already know I will want to come back 😍
 The advice I would love to receive from you is what can I buy there that is way cheaper than in Europe. I am only thinking to buy stuff for myself, but it is not that clear to me if there are really all these opportunities like it seems reading online. 
 Appreciate any tips
 Thanks folks 😃🖐🏼

 Relaxing its visa policy and extending visa-free stay for eligible countries.
 Developing new products and services that cater to the diverse needs and preferences of travelers.
 Promoting its natural beauty, cultural heritage and gastronomy as unique selling points.
 Leveraging its strong economic ties with neighboring countries and potential markets.
 What is your thought?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some advice from vietnamese families/women or anyone who has done this before in a vietnamese context. 
 I'm the only expat in my community and I'd really love to start a mom's group to get to know the others in the community better. I know the concept is probably not normal for Vietnam but would anyone have any suggestions on what sort of things would be a "draw" for a mom's group? I know how the groups are in my home country but my husband says if I just say "a time to share together, talk together, and learn from each other" no one will come (I kind of agree). I also don't want it to seem like a kid drop-off time if I say we will do things like have storytime and snacks. 
 What in your opinion would be some activities that would make a monthly group/meet-up for vietnamese moms exciting and worthwhile? 
 (For context, the group will be in vietnamese, and not in a large city setting) 
 Thanks!

 Are there any shops in Hanoi selling old (used) comics, books and magazines?
 When i'm abroad i'm always looking for comic books in the native language, especially Donald Duck (Donald và bạn hữ) but also the franco-belgian stuff like Tintin, Lucky Luke and Asterix. It seems all this series were published in Vietnam at least two decades ago but not any longer. I guess Mangas are the big thing now.
 A couple of years ago (2017?) in HCMC i stumbled across a street (can't remember which district) with shop on shop where old magazines were pieled up in front. I found a lot of stuff but it was just the first week of our trip and my wife would've killed me if we had to carry a ton of comics for a month...
 Are there any of these shops in Hanoi. I've been to Đinh Lễ Street and Nhà sách Mão already (these pop up when you google). But all i got was one new Tintin at Trang Tien bookstore. A lot of shops i found on Google Maps which seemed very promissing are actually closed (Covid i guess).
 Thanks!

 We're visiting Vietnam for the first time, and after seeing HCMC, Hanoi, Ha Long, and Da Nang/Hoi An we're considering for location to work one week remotely before heading home - thus, where would you stay and why (at end of April)?
 My initial consideration is:
 a) to avoid HCMC and Hanoi and due to hecticness
 b) to avoid Nha Trang due to the potentially high amount of russian tourists/ex-pats
 c) to highly consider staying in Da Nang/Hoi An and renting a villa
 Thank you in advance for your opinions! Much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this the right subreddit to consult. I am Eastern Orthodox Christian, but growing up my father and his side of the family were Catholic. I live near a Vietnamese Catholic church and I was always curious to observe a Catholic mass. Would I be judged for visiting a Vietnamese Catholic church on a random Sunday? As a Vietnamese person I notice that older Vietnamese individuals can be judgemental/gossip and as someone who usually wears head coverings to church out of respect and religious focus, I don't want to stick out too much.

I always see a group of Vietnamese plays together and trash-talking other players in their language. Their English is too bad that they even think the word trash-talking is swearing, and I were calling they are trash - I have no word. Kept trash talking about me because of the language barrier, I understand 100% what they said. However, they didn't listen and always thought that I did something wrong to them, then spread the misunderstanding to their friends... Became really toxic, killed me in spawn because they have a gang,...
 If you are the member in that gang, please. Stop making the image of a friendly country turning into a toxic place where every one of my friends always warn me to stay away from them online (even Vietnamese friends advised me it)
 I also wonder if it is the majority of your community is like that, or I'm just unlucky?

The sources don't bother mentioning in which specific situations they're recognized though. I'm planning to do the Ha Giang loop next week and heard they're checking for checking for licenses quite frequently nowadays. Has anyone showed their Filipino, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian or Singaporean license to the cops and gotten away with it? (Or any other ASEAN country, just got lazy to list them all)

Ofc it’s not as popular as the Yankees, Red Sox and D*dgers but I understand that MLB is more of a fashion brand and I’m sure most people who wear the brand probably don’t care about baseball at all but it just hits close to home seeing people rocking with it.

I don't remember the lyrics, but I remember the music videos to a certain degree.
 Song #1: This music video in particular showed a feud between two gangs I'm assuming. I vividly remember a scene where one gang is sitting around a table playing poker, and polishing their guns. I guess shit hit the fan, cause then they pulled up in a limo to the airport, and the other gang got off the airplane, and they just started fighting. LMAO
 Song #2: The MV was of a guy that looked like he was in a jail cell or something, and he was making a sculpture of a woman, and he went all deranged and destroyed the clay…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife is from Vietnam but has been living in the US for 8 years. Her parents have been living here longer, and no longer have any Vietnamese citizenship papers. The question concerns them.
 Due to circumstances they put their properties in the name of a relative who still lives in Vietnam, but now they wish to change that. Because they no longer have their citizenship papers, and it takes a long time to get them again, they cannot put the properties in their names. What sort of options do they have?
 I was wondering if there was a kind of trust they could use to own the property, but have the trust be controlled by them, or, at the very least, have it be controlled by a relative still in Vietnam, but with their name attached in some way that requires their consent for anything to be done to the property. They are old and probably too trusting, I want to see if there is any way we can help protect their interests as well as possible. They said they already spoke to an attorney, but I am not sure they spoke to the right kind or asked the right questions.
 Any help is appreciated.

Mình đang ở canada theo diện work permit nên sẽ có 3 năm để làm việc và cũng như cơ hội để kiếm thẻ xanh ở đây. Nhưng mà hiện tại thì em cảm thấy rất muốn về VN để sinh sống và làm việc cũng như được ở gần gia đình và bạn bè hơn. Nên mình dự tính là vẫn sẽ ở canada làm việc 2-3 năm để có thêm kinh nghiệm (và bằng CPA ). Mình chỉ đang thắc mắc là nếu trường hợp mình như vậy thì về vn có ổn không ạ? Và vấn đề lương thì mọi người thấy như thế nào? Mình thật sự rất cần lời khuyên ngay lúc này vì mình cảm thấy rất nhớ Việt Nam. Nếu quyết định về VN thì mình nghĩ lương sẽ không thể nào bằng được như ở CA được, nhưng mình nghĩ mình sẽ thoải mái hơn vì được gần gia đình và bạn bè và cũng như được ăn những món mình thích hoặc buồn thì cứ xách xe lên mà đi 1 vòng thôi. Nhưng nếu lương không ổn thì cũng hơi stress 1 tí. 
 Cho mình cảm ơn mọi người nhiều.
 Hi everyone. I have just graduated from the university majoring in accounting and currently working as an accountant in Big4. I am in Canada on a work permit so I will have 3 years to work as well as the opportunity to apply for a green card. But now, I really feel like going back to Vietnam to live and work so I can be closer to my family and friends. I’m planning to stay in Canada to work for 2-3 years to gain more experience (and getting CPA). Is ok to go back to Vietnam after that? And what about the salary expectation? I really need some advices right now because I miss Vietnam so much. If I do decide to return to Vietnam, I don't think the salary will be as good as compared to CA, but I think I will be happier since I can be closer family and friends .
 Thank you and I really appreciate any advices/ suggestions/ inputs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm currently in Southeast Asia and will be arriving in Vietnam in late April. I originally planned to do the motorbike loop in Ha Giang independently on rented bikes, but that was before I learned about needing a motorcycle license. I don't want to risk my insurance being void, so that's out of the question now. 
 I was pretty set on doing it independently without a company, so this threw a real wrench in my plan. I've already decided to skip travelling to Northern Thailand because of burning season, so I know I'll be back to the area, so my question is whether I should wait until I have a motorcycle license and do it later in life, or just suck it up and do it with an easy rider. 
 The reason I'm posting is just to hear how it went for other people. I don't love not being in control of my own bike, I'm somewhat introverted so the social aspect isn't huge, I like being able to stop and check out little shops or side roads, and I'm concerned with a bigger group that I won't be able to do this. I don't really have the money to do a private tour, and even doing it with an easy rider is putting a bit of a stretch on my budget. 
 Overall though, I'm wondering if I should still just do it. I suppose I'm just looking for stories of how people felt using easy riders and whether they felt like they would have had a better time doing it solo. The loop was the one thing I wanted to do the most out of Southeast Asia, but I'm wondering if I should just do it later when I can fully enjoy it. 
 Thanks in advance!

Would be wearing protective gear and staying off the roads that don’t allow bikes. The US IDP provided by AAA lists Vietnam as “not party to the 1949 convention but honors IDP”. This is a little confusing as Vietnam did sign the Geneva convention in 1953. So while we aren’t terribly worried about being allowed to do this, we are having trouble finding medical insurance coverage since there doesn’t appear to be any laws that explicitly say US citizens can rent or drive any type or vehicle there. We’ve read about certain companies that would provide medical coverage anyway as long as you are licensed and qualified in your home country but haven’t found one yet.
 Is anyone aware of a way we can do this? Or any companies that expats or travelers have used successfully recently? I’m not willing to ride without medical coverage so I would need to travel by other means or go somewhere else. This is a trip I’ve been thinking of doing for years - I’d be extremely bummed to have to see this beautiful country out a train window and not be able to experience the smaller mountain communities along the journey (I’d also need to do the trip alone in this case). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spent 9 days traveling in Vietnam. Started from Hoi An and kept moving to Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, and ended at Ho Chi Minh. Used different modes of transport, met tons of people, and experienced things that I'm truly grateful for.
 My experiences helped me break a lot of stereotypes and prejudices that were told to me before my visit. Vietnam is not a country for cheap shopping or fake stuff or weird food. it's not a country where people will con you or misguide you. It's not a country that is rude, indifferent, or selfish.
 After 9 days in Vietnam, I'm taking back memories of meeting kind locals who go out of their way to help you, friendly shopkeepers who give you a small sovenieur as good luck because you made them smile while bargaining, helpful grab drivers who gave you a genuine smile just because you bowed and offered with money with both hands, Bar tenders and staff, who booked grab for me and offered a free drink just because i was nice to them. At every situation I got stuck or lost, I was given direction by locals who didn't have to give a fuck about me. After traveling many places in the world, I sincerely believe that if tourists remove their stereotypical blindfolds, they can experience a truly beautiful country I.e. Vietnam. ❤️ And that's what I'm taking back to India with me.
 P.S: I would like to offer my hospitality if anyone is planning to travel to India, especially Mumbai. Over and out.

 It's my first time initiating something like this, so I need help. Here's my thought process: 
  
Set up a website, describe the scholarship, purpose, amount, something simple like this memorial trust looks doable enough (https://pdgtrust.org/thong-tin-hoc-bong/?lang=vi)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: trying to find an old family graveyard. I know it’s hopeless, but maybe someone here has some advice lol
 My grandmother’s grandmother is from Huế, my grandmother’s family is from Tra Vinh, where we went to a family graveyard when we went to Vietnam for the first time this summer. We were able to come there since our family still has contact with Hmong people (?) that used to work for the family who own it now. It had the graves of many family members except one, my grandmother’s grandmother: Nguyễn Thị Điệm (born ca. 1880). Although there was a picture of her with her date of death: 20 Aug 1916. My grandmother told me that she was buried in Huế with her family, and that her brother who now lives in the US visited the grave in 2000 via contact with the gravekeepers, although she has not had contact with him for a long time, and does not seem very keen on doing it either. Apparently her brother (my greatuncle) is also not that bright due to his years in the camp.
 The family was apparently very rich, and were according to my family close to the emperor, I know nothing else except that Nguyễn Thị Điệm’s brother was a very prestigious or conceited photographer.
 I know its probably hopeless, but does anyone maybe have any advice on how i should find (how to contact) the graveyard (owners)? Or any other advice?
 Or just drop your personal family stories in the comments:)

 How does it work typically? I work for an MNC and while I do not want to go into the zone of corruption, I do want to understand the dynamics between seller/customers. 
 Do people typically go KTVs for some 'fun' or is it usually in normal dinner places or what not? Are gifts expected?

 So I'm actually a half Filipino half Vietnamese(dad filipino, mom vietnamese), when I was 7 years old, my mom was ask to go back to Vietnam since she's been overstayed here in the Philippines, and promised to comeback after she fix the issue, and in the first few months we still have a communication with her and then suddenly gone, no calls, letter, etc.
 I am now 24 years old, Ive been searching for her for years, I do not wish her to come back to our lives, I just wanted to know how was she's been doing. I tried searching her on facebook but no luck, cuz everytime I searched her full name a lot of the accounts has the same or similar names, I even include my middle name which is "Nguyen" in my facebook so its easier for her to find me.
 And I'm not even sure if this is right sub to post this, and sorry if my writing is scuffed, and also my english😅😅

 I will be traveling for 4 months around South East Asia and am looking to buy medical insurance.
 All the providers I've seen (including reputable ones like TrueTraveller or World Nomads) say it on their fine print that they only cover medical treatment in state-run hospitals.
 I am looking for a provider that would foot the bill from a private hospital.
 Does anyone know of any providers?
 Thanks!

 I plan to travel to Da Nang via Ho Chi Minh City. The plane ticket that I am looking at has 1 hour 50 minutes layover in HCMC Airport. The airport's domestic terminal doesn't seem so far away from the international terminal. But being a foreigner, I need to go though the customs and immigrations, which I heard could take approximately an hour.
 Would I have enough time to catch the connecting flight to Da Nang or should I get another ticket that has a 3 hour layover?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am Vietnamese girl dating an expat for the 1st time, plz give me some advices. I live in Hanoi, he lives in HCM so this is the first time dating. He asks me to show him around when we meet in Hanoi. I was kinda passive in the relationships with other Vietnamese boyfriends before, like they picked me up to dating locations. Thus, I don’t know how to take the lead in dating with an expat in Hanoi. Which type of transportation used when we date? I don’t have car driving license. Pick him up by a motorbike I drive is bit weird, isn’t it? Have you been in this situation? Plz share your experience. Kindly introduce me some places that expats want to hangout in Hanoi. We are both in twenties. Much appreciated!
 Edit: Thank so much for your advice. Most of them are very helpful. I am way too overthinking. I was worried about the size difference if I drive him on a bike, im like 5’1 feet while he is 6’2 feet. But, I will ask him what he wants to choose bike or cab although bike is the my most preferred transport when hanging out in Hanoi. To whom who may wish me luck with green card: he is not even a Western. He is my Hindu colleague. We hit it off and accept a long distance relationship. That’s it. Now Vietnamese girls don’t date expats for money. We can be both cute and rich at the same time. Get used to it.

 I am visiting Vietnam in July this year for a close friend's wedding. Just wondering what Vietnamese people typically give their friends and loved ones as a wedding gift? I've actually never been to any wedding as an adult so I'm a bit lost and gifting in a completely different culture makes it feel even more daunting. I would love to hear some examples of what you would typically choose as a wedding gift.
 Also - Other foreign friends who are going have said they are just going to give the couple money, is this normal/acceptable in Vietnam? And if so, how much should one typically give?
 Appreciate any insights, cheers

 I'm very interested in the Vietnam war and already know plenty about it, so visiting something like this seem like a natural choice but at the same time I hate things that are too touristy and this seem exactly that. People posing for dumb pictures, like thousands of others before them, standing on destroyed tanks or in entrances to one of the tunnels.
 Would you recommend it?

 Because i came across something on youtube that looks like targetting views/clicks from indians. The contents looks like from Vietnam hence i posted here. Sorry if this is not the right place for this.

 I am planning on traveling in Northern Vietnam this month. The air quality apps show really high PM 10 and PM 2.5 numbers, meaning the air is hazardous for health.
 I was wondering - is this casual for that side of the country or is it because of the burning season, similarly to Northern Thailand?
 Maybe anyone currently travelling there could share there experiences?
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Community,
 I'm in Da Nang for the next 7 weeks and love it so far. But still did not meet any local women, which I obviously wouldn't mind. I would like to go out tomorrow night, I don't mind going solo. And then, I am usually not afraid to talk with a women if there seems to be an ''opening''. I value a good friendship, and nice communication / talk, even if nothings happens afterwards. It's really mostly about meeting local people/women and ''why not if more''.
 What would be the best nightclubs to easily meet local people who are more likely to be ''into foreigners'' (I am in my thirties, very healthy and tall, I think I can be doing ok) and more likely to be able to talk a bit or good English ? Avoiding places full of ''pro's'' and full of Koreans could be a good thing I imagine :D (but I imagine it's not always avoidable).
 Thanks in advance !

 Lạc vào trong xứ sở dâu tây
 Phía đằng xa,
 Giữa bãi cỏ hai người nằm ra
 Chú cuội ngủ cùng chị Hằng Nga

 Gọi cô tấm đi dự hội làng
 Bảy cô lùn đi cùng ông tuyết
 nếu bị lạc liên hệ tổng đài 1900-00-không-biết

 ăn bánh quy, kẹo chip chip, sữa chua nếp cẩm
 aladin gạ gẫm mỵ nương bàn kế hoạch hóa
 sơn tinh ném bàn ghế gạch đá
 scooby dooby doo lại phải dắt sơn tinh đi tù
 giơ khẩu súng nặn bằng đất sét
 cả ngôi làng đều chạy mất dép

 thủy tinh mang theo cốc trà chanh
 làng vắng tanh như chùa bà đanh
 ran mori sử dụng tán thủ
 các võ sư không ai dám thử
 nên nàng đưa conan về nhà cả hai phá án ở nhà thám tử
 một giấc mơ suýt thì hoàn chỉnh
 có giọng nói làm mình choàng tỉnh
 xanh, đỏ, tím, vàng

 ​
 We are going to Vietnam for 2 weeks late March with my wife (28 and 25 year old): 5 days in HCM, 3days in Phu Quoc and 5days in Hanoï.
 ​
 In Hanoï we are thinking going there:
  
Hanoi Train Streets
 Ha Long Bay : do you recommend 2days/1night or 3days/2nights?
 Vietnam Military History Museum
 Hoàn Kiếm Lake
 Don Xuan market
 French quarter
  
​
 HCM:
  
Ben Thanh market
 An Dong market
 War remnants Museum
 Vincom Center
 Nam Cat Tien park
 Nguyen Hue walk
 Mekong Delta
  
​
 Do you have any recommendations or advices? 
 Also, I am a bit clueless on the best transportation to go to Ha Long Bay or Mekong Delta. In the city, I planned to use Grab or Go-jek.
 ​
 Thanks in advance :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years ago I was constantly seeing stories about how Vietnam had the highest economic growth in Southeast Asia. Was getting massively invested in by Japan and Korea, and had tons of companies relocating to it from China during the Sino-American trade war. Many YouTubers I was watch on the ground said they could see the explosive growth year by year as it felt like the early days of China as it was beginning to achieve great economic success. The everyday life was becoming tangibly better year by year.
 But I checked in again recently, and I saw the GDP growth has massively faltered the past two years, and also saw that the previous economics minded president has seemingly been replaced by a more politics minded one.
 So I was just wondering, does Vietnam still seem to be on track for explosive growth and this is just a short break because of COVID or is the growth really slowing down? Is life still improving year by year in Vietnam to a noticable degree?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am on Phu Quoc right now and I see it again. Huuuuge luxury hotels, but nearly completely empty. When I look the price up its 5M Dong a night. 5M Dong. 
 How do these luxury hotels even survive? Why they don’t lower the price?
 It seems like the hotel owners are so crazy rich they don’t care about some losses and don’t want to lower the prices to not lose image or something. (imagine you pay $200 for a hotel and some months later it’s $100 a night because of low demand. in Europe or also in Thailand, hotels dgaf and just lower the price to get at least some customers, but here it’s not like that). Or?? I can’t understand it pls explain me guys
 Also this Vin Grand World has sooo many restaurants and stuff with expensive food, but most of them are completely empty because it’s too expensive when you could get outside the same food for much lower price. 
 It seems like the “market” with demand offer etc doesn’t really work for these giants they just dgaf about losses, or is there some bigger story behind that? I also remember how people in this sub once talked how expensive vinfast cars became or smth like that

 Have you stayed in a hotel in the Old Quarter recently?
 I visited Hanoi in 2018, 2019 and again in 2022. The hotels had changed a lot in 3 years as many had been affected by Covid and the flood damage. While no doubt it's down to the unfortunate circumstances, the last couple of places I stayed in 2022 were nothing like the photos/reviews, were damaged and run down.
 Bringing the family along in 2023 and would like to know your recommendations for a nice place to stay.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I visited Hanoi for a few weeks and went to some clubs too. In most clubs the sold balloons and I was told they contain laughing gas. Saw some people getting really high on it and kinda knocked out sometimes.
 Friend handed me (already very drunk) one and I tried it several times excessively but had no reaction.
 First, I don't know if laughing gas is illegal. Some clubs were really suspicious and you had to talk to some guy around a corner to get through some secret gate. Somehow you couldn't here any of the loud music outside.
 And second could we get scammed? Is selling fake gas a thing? I'm not a fan and won't do it ever again, but I'm really interested in understanding what happened there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone, Yeah it's another Vietnam itinerary.
 I'm traveling with my wife from India to spend around 2 weeks in this country on our anniversary. Need help in making an itinerary that has a balance of both a little fast and relaxed overall.
 But I'm too confused to jot down the itinerary completely, mainly in the number of days to spend in a city. Some parts are fixed though.
 Fixed (15 days): 14th April '23 to 28th April '23,
 Flights Booked and stay booked for Phu Quoc
 14th arrival (Ho Chi Minh) Going to Phu Quoc directly
 14th to 16th (Phu Quoc)
 28th departure (Hanoi)
 I want to cover the country from south to central to the north, with the 19th being preferred not traveling as it's our anniversary that day.
 Uncertain (16th to 28th):
 No Stay or Travel option booked
 16th to 18th: Ho Chi Minh Stay
 18th to 19th: Nha Trang, can this be skipped? as it'll make us travel on the 19th to Hoi An/Da nang
 19th to 21st: Hoi An, Da nang, and Ba Na Hills (Unable to select dates to stay where on which date, maximizing things to do in each place)
 22nd to 28th: Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Sa pa
 We want to cover Ninh Binh and Phong Nha National Park as well but that doesn't seem to be possible as this above draft itself feels a little rushed. We are already removed Dalat and Hue from our itinerary for the same reason, doesn't want it to be too fast-paced.
 Now I want help with what place we can omit if this itinerary looks too rushed or not possible.
 Any other suggestion for a newbie in Vietnam please do suggest!

 Has anyone ever heard of a store in Saigon called Kallos? It’s located in D10 and they have items I want to get for myself and others, however I cannot find anyone (so far) who has either heard of them or shopped there. 
 They’re an outlet (similar to Vincom) and have excellent professional reviews and items, nice FB page, reviews and it’s run by a Korean man who opened up his own shop. But it would be very reassuring to know if someone has actually shopped here before. 
 If either anyone here, or you have someone who has shopped here before, please let me know and the most important let me know if the products you bought were authentic or fake because this is what I’m worried about more than anything. I attach an image of the address and business as well. Kallos Vietnam

 I have a driver's license in Germany for cars only and I have a Vietnamese passport but my residence is in Germany.
 I would like to bring an international Driver's license back to Vietnam to ride a motorbike legally. I know I just need to do a practical test.
 My question is: will my licence have a short expiry date like foreigners who stay in Vietnam for a limited time? Or will the license expiration date be the same as my driver's licence in Germany because I have Vietnamese citizenship? I have no residence in Vietnam.
 My plan is to use the license again for multiple visits. It will take time for the license to be issued, so I can't afford the time to get the license every time I visit Vietnam.
 (Yes, I know I can drive illegally and bribe officers, but I want my health and liability insurance to pay for higher damages if I ever get into a serious accident)

 Tôi sẽ đánh giá cao nếu bạn có thể hiểu rằng dư luận Hàn Quốc phần lớn cũng đang chỉ trích Bộ trưởng. Dù vậy chính phủ hiện nay đang bị chỉ trích rất nhiều nhưng không ngờ Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng lại làm như vậy... Go Vietnam
 As a Korean, I feel embarrassed about this incident. I regret the terrible things that happened during the Vietnam War.
 I would appreciate it if you could understand that Korean public opinion is largely criticizing the Minister as well. Although the current government is being criticized a lot, it is unexpected that the Defense Minister would do such a thing... Go Vietnam

 Does anyone know if this can be cheaply fixed in Vietnam. I am aware lcd screens can be costly. We are going to Nha Trang next, then Ho Ch Minh and Phu Quoc.
 Should I just buy a new/second hand phone? If so, any recommendations where I could buy one from. Thanks!

I understand that there are plenty of museums in Hanoi and Saigon, but I’m curious to hear about other historically significant locations that can be visited and learned from as a tourist. 
 Large graves, temples, war zones, etc.. are of interest, if possible.

I really want to go back at some point and I’m curious as to how much Hanoi has changed. Some things I remember:
 Roads were like 90% motorcycles, 7% cars, and 3% bikes
 Sông tô lịch was literally just an open sewer (please tell me this has gotten better lmao)
 No one wore seatbelts, and while I was there when people began being required to wear helmets, a lot of people wouldn’t buckle them
 Cutting in line was very common 
 Crosswalks weren’t a thing, you just walked across the street and people swerved around you
 Has any of this changed?

 Era was recommended by my hotel but I had low expectations. I'm happy to say that the food and service were magnificent. 
 Duan and his wife are foodies and it shows in the taste and presentation of the good eats they serve at their restaurant. After a short chat I learned that Duan is self-taught cook and that he and his wife love to experiment with recipes. His methodology puts me in mind of a food scientist. 
 I left very full. Very happy. And, very satisfied. I finally had a meal that was worth all the hype.

 I was on a tour with another company when I realized the return time to Halong Bay City would make me late for a transfer to Hanoi. I was assured at booking that there would not be a conflict but that was not the case. 
 I saw Thao's boat departing (a completely different company) and asked if I could hitch a ride back to the city with them. Both the captain and Thao, the tour guide, agreed to let me come along. 
 But, it gets better. Thao called my hotel so I could grant permission for the transfer driver to pick-up my luggage. 
 He also called the transport company to arrange an alternate pick-up location and changed my pick up time. Then Thao had one of his wait staff to rush me to the new pick-up location on the back of her scooter. Thanks to them I made it to Hanoi and now sit comfortably in my hotel room. 
 Thao refused a tip and I paid a nominal fee to the captain and the waitress/motorbike driver. In fact, the waitress returned half of the very small fee I paid her and refused when I insisted she keep all of it. 
 I'm so grateful to Thao and the staff for helping a complete stranger. They truly went above and beyond earning them the LifeSaver award. Many thanks to them all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love living in Vietnam 🇻🇳 ❤️ but the thing that kills me is the unnecessarily LOUD TRUCK HORNS. My ears hurt and it startles me (sometimes to the point of crashing) every time one of them decides to blare their cargo ship horn near me. I get alerts on my Apple Watch all the time about how the noise level could cause hearing loss. Oh and the way they drive is insane too! This happens all the time: a big ol 🚛 barreling down the road in the lane traveling the opposite direction from me ENTERS INTO MY LANE, and almost literally RUNS ME OFF THE ROAD. Keep in mind, as a guy driving a motorbike, I’m already in the habit of riding on the very edge of the road, but in the interest of safety, I’ve had to go off the road so many times because some impatient cargo truck driver can’t stand to behind another car so they invade a lane of oncoming traffic whenever they feel like it.
 Back to the horn problem…it has caused numerous deaths. It’s so loud that it had caused people to be startled to the point of falling off their motorbike and getting hit by the semi trucks or getting into deadly accidents with other vehicles from loss of control. It happens too much, and although there is technically a law against it but the penalty (like 2-3tr vnđ) is so light compared to the damage it causes.

 It was shipped quickly from HongKong to Ho Chi Minh for about 3 days, but then it got stuck at a clearance process for over a week. Now I have no clue what I need to do next since Fedex Vietnam keeps asking me to wait.
 For those having the same experiences, is that your typical durations for an import custom process to Vietnam? This is a first time I buy a product from foreign countries so I am little shock.

 Iced milk coffee
 According to the culinary website Taste Atlas, Vietnam's iced coffee ranks second among the top 10 best coffees in the world.
 Taste Atlas describes, Vietnamese iced coffee is a combination of dark black coffee with condensed milk and ice.
 Traditionally, iced milk coffee must be made from medium or coarsely ground Vietnamese coffee, typically Robusta.
 The way to make Vietnamese coffee is also unique, unlike anywhere else in the world when pouring hot water through a small filter to let each drop of concentrated coffee flow into the cup, then it will be mixed with condensed milk and added ice.
 Please enjoy once if you have the opportunity to visit Vietnam.

I had internet again the next day and got a message in the evening the 1gb/day was used up. You get but on dozens of other messages that tell something about tariffs but translated only make half sense. Can I ignore them? (I know this from South America where you were often spammed with fake stuff). And do you know which messages you can take seriously?
 Also, how does the charging work? I have seen that there is a short code *101#. In general, I am a bit clueless and would need someone to explain the whole thing to me. Thanks in advance!
 Viettel btw

Mind you, I will not be shipping any electronics or perishables (food) or anything like this ever, I would only ever need to order skin/hair care from South Korea to Vietnam. The shop I order from is KoreaDepart, they ship everywhere, however my question is not with them it’s about can I get the products into Vietnam without being seized or held up and having to pay out the ass in fees.

 Where in Vietnam has the best rainforest? I'm really interested in seeing the most amazing wildlife possible - in Indonesia for instance I saw Orangutans. 
 Does Vietnam or Cambodia have better wildlife rainforests?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see posts a lot where it is usually a foreigner marrying a girl from VN. However, does anyone have experience with marrying a man from VN as a foreigner?
 I'm not really a foreigner either, I'm a VK but don't speak vietnamese at all, but I do speak a chinese dialect and was able to get around a little in VN when I was there for 1 month. During that time, I met someone that is too perfect. We aren't dating, just friends, we met accidently. His family runs a little food shop/stand and I couldn't speak Vietnamese so he stepped in to help and we just started talking since I was there during slow business time.
 Prior to that I also thought about moving to VN to stay closer to family. I also like VN but I feel like I am romanticizing it too much and the reason I like it is because I can escape from my problems (work burnout).
 ​
 I don't really know what I really want to ask. I just want to hear from people about their experience. Since men and women in VN can be different in a relationship because of culture. I don't want to start a relationship and get his hopes up since he is older than me with aging parents.

 Does anyone know how to get your social security insurance contributions or a law firm that could help? 
 I am moving back to the states and was told by my HR Rep that the government can only give me a plaque/certificate with the years worked, not MONEY
 I am owed a decent amount of money and the government has refused to pay, I heard this was also a problem in china but know of friends getting their money there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember being very interested in Vietnam's Tay Son period ever since I was as young as 7, and I remember always feeling extremely unwell hearing about all these Tay Son bloodlines and everything, including famous generals like Bùi Thị Xuân and her daughter getting stomped to death by elephants. Or the ensuing executions of Nguyễn Nhạc's children by having them sawed in half. Despite it being years later, I still feel sad reading about the infamous Nguyen Lord and later Gia Long's rampage against Quang Trung's monarch. But then It is also my responsibility to be aware that part of his bloodlust was also due to the fact that he had witnessed the killings against his own family when the Tay Son swept down South.
 Humans are scary.
 If anyone else has any insight or corrections which I know will be inevitably pointed out, I would totally love to hear them and see what else I needed to learn about this event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to Vietnam next month, going from Ho Chi Minh, through central Vietnam and ending in Hanoi. 
 I don’t eat pork or shellfish , and would prefer not to eat any other meat such as chicken or beef. 
 How easy will it be to find options that are ‘chay’ when I am out exploring? How easy will it be to avoid fish sauce, which I know contains shrimp, for example? 
 Is there anything I could buy in a supermarket that is vegetarian that I could quickly grab and go, if I’m in a hurry ?
 Many thanks! 😊

 Did not have much luck with banks. Most do not offer loans for foreigners, or people living outside of HN or SG. Vietnam Russia Bank (VRB) seemed to be the easiest for foreigners. 
 I then found Homebase and it seemed too perfect. But the more I read about them in both English and Vietnamese media, the more they seem legit. Though it's hard to find much reviews from customers that aren't their own promotional material.
 Does anyone know of any experiences with them? Interested hearing both Vietnamese and foreigner experiences.
 If not familiar, they work like: they initially buy the property and own it, then you buy it back from them at a pre-agreed upon price (at any time). You're allowed use the property while buying back.

I was directed to the office but a guy stepped up yo me and offered to get me a pcr test to let me fly for $200. In a panic, i agreed and he did some stuff and got me the test, but the gate was closed. So basically i had to buy a flight ticket to Osaka for a little bit later ($455) because i was told i couldn’t get any refund or transfer for the ticket i had + my visa for Vietnam was over today. I then had to pay the guy 4 mil for the pcr and sprinted to make my flight. In addition, new flight from Osaka Just ran into another guy in Osaka who was at the airport and he said the fake pcr was not only 150 but i could have just paid 1 mil to have my ticket changed until i could get a real pcr test for cheap. I feel like an idiot although i know i was just panicked and wanted nothing more than to make it to Tokyo so I’m out $700 extra dollars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I have been reading about the Doi Moi policy, which the Communist Party or Vietnam (CPV) implemented in 1986. 
 A lot of articles and videos I found on the Internet tend to praise the policy for transforming Vietnam into a rising economy in the ASEAN region, surpassing my country (the Philippines) and others in terms of economic growth and development. 
 I even watched a video from Bloomberg about how North Korea once planned of adopting Vietnam-style reforms to open and grow its economy before the COVID-19 pandemic.
 So I want to know what this sub thinks of Doi Moi. Should other developing countries like the Philippines and North Korea follow Vietnam's example? Was it effective in bringing prosperity to Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m curious, has anyone ever been to “Tuyết Thành” - outside of Saigon? What’s it like? How hard is it to get to from Saigon?
 “Tuyết Thành, or "Snowy Citadel" in English, is a city located just 35 kilometers outside of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite being situated in a tropical region, Tuyết Thành is renowned for its year-round snowfall, which is a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for years.”
 “The snow in Tuyết Thành is a stunning sight to behold, falling softly from the sky to create a winter wonderland that is both surreal and magical. The snow is powdery and light, making it perfect for building snowmen or engaging in snowball fights. The cause of this phenomenon remains a mystery, but locals speculate that it's due to a unique combination of climatic and geographic factors. Nonetheless, Tuyết Thành is a popular destination for tourists seeking an extraordinary winter experience in Vietnam.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I recently made a post about shipping an open-box ps4 to my cuz in HCMC using an independent Viet shipper here, and it got held up at customs. That’s what the shipper told me anyway. 
 I’ve decided to ship her a brand new console in the box and everything. What shipping should I use to ensure that she’ll get it? I have UPS, FedEx, DHL, regular postal service. 
 Any tips on filling out customs paperwork and stuff to make sure it gets through? 
 If you’re wondering why I’m not giving her the money to just buy one, I got this ps5 as a gift for free so I can’t justify shelling out $500-600.
 Edit: extra words

 Anyone into it? Im new to it however i have some cash to blow on a good setup.
 Anyone buy locally or suggest any good shops? Id rather not piece ship it internationally and if i dont have to rather not buy when i head to US and put it on the plane. 
 I debated steams full setup and a new PC to run it. I am really going to focus on a realistic driver setup(minus the moving hydrolic chair stuff) and flight simulator to learn how to fly.
 Hanoi is ok to but prefer Saigon.
 Open to people commenting on setups also if they have experience since im a noob to it all

 I'm not familiar with shipping to Vietnam and wanted to get some insights here from the people who have experience with this.
 Which service would you recommend (Amazon, etc.)? Would it be 100% reliable? What obstacles might exist there? And is it as easy as simply ordering on the website and waiting for delivery, or would I need to personally contact customs to pay any extra fees? 
 I live in Central Vietnam so it would not be possible for me to go to Hanoi or HCMC to deal with customs.

 I came to the US in 2005 with a passport that was issued in 2003 (expired in 2008). I am currently a permanent resident. My boss is asking me if I want to go overseas for a couple months for business trips in April. However, I do not know if I can even renew my original passport or can I just get a new one? I am near DC so I can just drive there for passport service instead of mailing documents in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in my last 6 months of schooling and want to take my CELTA certification to come teach in Vietnam. I was really set on Hanoi, but from what I have been reading it is apparently not a very walkable city. Here in the US, I do not own a car and very rarely drive. I have taken public transportation my whole life and really prefer that to owning/paying for a car.
 I am a bit freaked out by the idea of renting a scooter given how hectic the roads are, but I will do it if that's what it takes to come live in Vietnam. But I was wanting to ask how feasible is it to walk and use public transport in Hanoi, or if there is a better city that is suited for this that is not HCMC? What about places outside major cities? Thanks for your help

 Is Phu Cuoc overcrowded now? What about Mui Ne?
 Safe for foreigners? Any kidnappings / crazy shit? Are the Russian tourists causing any problems?
 How easy is it renting a car? Or what’s the best way of getting around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im new to Reddit so not sure how to post text with pictures. After posting this incidents in some FB groups, people shared their similar experiences so it happens quite a lot. I have never thought someone dares to steal in this area where there are so many security cameras
 Summary: - Before going through security screening, I took off my watch, put it in my purse. My purse didn't have zipper or lock. Put my purse lying down next to my husband's bag, in the same tray. (XRAY MACHINE IMAGE confirmed there was watch in my purse) - My husband push the bag tray in Xray machine then went through body scan. Then another man jumped in while I was taking off my shoes. I let him since I didn't want to delay other people - I went through body scan after pushing the shoe tray in Xray - Right after that, I got my purse back from my husband at the conveyor belt. I STOOD RIGHT THERE AND SEARCHED FOR THE WATCH, it was gone. I walked a little further (about 10 steps) to avoid blocking the way and took all stuff out of my purse to search for it. Nothing - 1 minute later (YES WE HAVE CAMERA FOOTAGE), my husband went back to the conveyor belt area to check all the trays around. Found nothing - I reported the issue to the airport security team. No official report, no help from them. Later I had to fly back to Phu Quoc to make a scene and got official report and watched camera footage and Xray machine images.

 So I'm here living with my wife and I'm trying to learn the language. Things are going quite well as far as reading and writing and speaking. But understanding what people say to me is really not going well. 
 We live in the far south, near Long Xuyên. 
 There's one sound in particular that is killing my brain, and that is the words beginning with "ch".
 All references I can find for learning the language indicate that words like chào like in xin chào are pronounced the same way we would in English, like chow, choice, chomp etc.
 Down here in the south people pronounce it with more of a g sound as in growl, gouge, graph. My wife says this is not true, but to my ear that's what it sounds like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Im currently in negotiations to work with a well established startup in vn.
 They have already received 2 rounds of funding for 12 million USD and have yearly sales of almost 50 million. They are doing well and employing around 75 people, including native engineers and many skilled factory workers. 
 After this month of brutal internet, the series B round funders have issued an ultimatum for them to move design out of vietnam immediately. This was very embarrassing after a month of video call after video call was dropped; we were having a terrible time accessing code repositories hosted out of country, and a bunch of other problems due to new products relying on cloud connectivity. 
 the investors are foreign, frankly they have little faith in whats going on here. They seem to believe its not just a coincidence of all the internet cables but one breaking down; but rather a systematic problem, either in infrastructure, or govt mismanagement. They visited earlier this month, met with city officials in ho chi minh, and were appalled at the attitude, as well as conditions around the city, and believe growth in a high tech field will only be impeded by being here. 
 Frankly i cant argue. I love what we are working on and hate to have to turn away from this myself, but while they can work hard and compete, they will always be be hamstrung by access to real talent, and the 2nd world infrastructure. There is a culture of inefficiency in vn thinking that fester these kinds of problems. But founder is a rare brilliant vietnamese engineer who came home to make something good here, and looks like they wont be able to stay. 
 Come on vn, get your shit together.

Also I was the only one in the store, it was early morning. What are your feelings on this, would you consider it rude or disrespectful? I wouldn't try this if they were busy, or if I knew the person was born here, I just like the feedback and maybe it would make them feel more welcomed and make them remember their home country?
 I'm not sure, have at me!

 Also, country other than Vietnam is also welcome(except Europe,since we can travel for 9 days only) .

 Hello there I’m not Vietnamese but I stumble upon a video on Facebook about a case of a pet salon where the workers unprofessionalism ended up in a dog’s death, by doing my research I found the original video on YouTube it’s called chewy hung to death at a pet spa by Brent Strydom (I really recommend not watching the video as it was incredibly graphic and horrible to see what happens to the dog) the user called Brent strydom seems to have been the owner of chewy and was claiming justice for what happened, it was uploaded on 2017 so idk if it got resolved or not since comments are deactivated and he didn’t left any social media on his channel to contact him so if anyone may know something about this case please let me know

 We are four friends who are planning a trip to Southeast Asia between December 2023 and January 2024. As we begin to plan our itinerary, we are hoping to find a relaxing spot where we can unwind and swim towards the end of our trip.
 We've heard so much about the natural beauty of your countries and we would love to experience it firsthand. As described in the post on r/laos linked below, we would like to do a wild experience in the first weeks. We are hoping to find a beach or lake where we can enjoy some peace and quiet at the end of our travel. We are also hoping to find a spot with some amenities nearby, like restaurants or shops, but we don't want anything too crowded or touristy.
 We would really appreciate any recommendations you might have for a relaxing spot where we can swim and unwind during our trip. We are open to any and all suggestions, so please feel free to share your favorite spots and hidden gems with us.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Verse 1:
 I'm hopping on a plane
 Leaving right away
 My heart's set on a different name
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 My flip-flops and my shorts
 Are waiting at the door
 To explore every hidden nook
 Of Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's never been too clean
 Where the traffic's like a symphony
 And the street food's obscene
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's got its own soundtrack
 With motorbikes and horns and shouting
 And sunsets that take my breath
 ​
 Verse 2:
 I'm ready to escape
 This monotonous place
 And see how life's done in the East
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 From Pho to Banh Mi
 And everything in between
 The food here is so divine
 In Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 Where coffee's a religion
 And there's so much life on every street
 That I feel pure elation
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That never seems to sleep
 Where locals bike and tourists gawk
 And the air's a little too thick
 ​
 Bridge:
 If I can make it here
 I'll make it anywhere
 It's up to you
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's got its own kind of magic
 With history that's felt at every turn
 And energy that's so classic
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's got its own style and flair
 With markets that hustle and bustle
 And a pulse that's beyond compare
 ​
 Outro:
 Saigon, Saigon
 I wanna wake up in a city that screams my name
 Saigon, Saigon
 Where the hustle and bustle is always insane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VIP eleven passenger mini van from Da Lat to Nha Trang. Optional hotel pick-up ( I went to the bus station) and drop off directly at your destination hotel. There is one restroom stop on this route. We left on time and arrived on schedule. 
 First of all the staff are excellent. Friendly and helpful check in agent and driver. 
 Have no issue whatsoever with the customer service. For that this vendor earns three stars. 
 Areas of improvement:
 VIP bus was messy. Had water bottles and trash from previous guests. Mini van was a little worn. Not as pristine as the photos but not terrible either. 
 Where Cuc Tung looses stars is the driving experience. It was terrifying. The driver took unnecessary risks. There was low visibility due to fog and rain. Other travelers pulled off unto the side of the road but our driver's speed barely slowed down around the twists and turns of the mountain two lane highway And, he regularly passed cars while in blind curves. It was three a* clenching hours I was thankful to have survived. 
 Safety should be a higher priority than timeliness.

 I went to most stalls in the area, even the small street vendors and they all claim that the jade they sell is real. I am just curious about the authenticity because their jade were selling for only a fraction of what it would cost in gold stores. For example, some ranged between 50k - 1 mill. Also, what is the deal with the price difference? I assume some may be either fake or real. If anyone is familiar with the area, some advice on where to find an authentic dealer is highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few questions about the housing market in HCMC. I’m really just asking out of curiosity since I can’t actually purchase a SFR in Vietnam. Reading about Seoul’s fucked-up housing situation kind of freaks me out so I’m kind of curious about what’s happening in HCMC. 
 My aunt “recently” sold their childhood house in D3 of HCMC for ~$500K USD. This is just what I overheard so I could honestly be mistaken, but this seems like a crazy amount for someone in VN to purchase considering the average annual salary of someone in HCMC. The only thing that stands out about this house to me is that it’s unlike the standard tall, narrow row houses with 4+ floors and had two floors, was much “wider” than it was tall, and had a backyard. It was a little out of place relative to the other structures around it. 
 Is this “standard” pricing throughout most of HCMC? Sorry, I know this is a particularly stupid question since HCMC is massive. 
 Do most people in HCMC “dream” about purchasing single family residences or has the goal shifted to purchasing a nice condo? Another family member told me that you can reasonably expect a newer condo to go for about ~$80K USD which still seems disproportionately high for the average salary, but I don’t know. 
 Who is still able to purchase a “house” or a “condo”? 
 Would you say the majority of people in HCMC today were born and raised there or moved there in the last 20 or so years?

It isn’t very cold… but she wants to know if there is a market or store there that sells warming blankets that you put on a bed and plug into the wall outlet? Where would she get that?

 I bought it in Danang from one of the big electronic stores. There are three A52 models. Mine is the regular A52 that does not support 5G. Model SM-A525F/DS.

 We are desperate to find it because it is exactly what you would expect from similar covers. (Thai Tai's "Never Gonna Give You Up" cover is peak 90s cheesy and unexpected.) I am actively combing through my playlists and discography to find it, and am wondering if the song goes by a different title in Vietnamese.
 I recall it was Trung Hanh or someone similar who sang it, but I cannot accurately recall.
 Thanks in advance,
 Keru

 Many shops tape up your bag with sticky tape when you buy something.

My question is not why such practices exist (presumably all are somehow intended to minimize theft) and what they might indicate about society---that has been discussed here before.
 Instead, my question is where and how they originated. Can anybody shed light on where, how and when these practices became widespread in VN---and how they spread to become ubiquitous across the country?
 (Obviously these practices are not all unique to VN; that's irrelevant.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm long-term renting a house here in VN and like most other houses there is a large-ish altar built in to a wall (complete with switched yellow lights) and another altar above the kitchen hearth. 
 I'm not Vietnamese and so the concept of ancestor veneration is totally foreign to me, but I appreciate that it's a part of the culture here. In my own house though, I really don't care. So the kitchen alter is currently holding spices, and the main home alter is bare (I was thinking it'd be good for books and knickknacks).
 My question: Am I going to offend someone or put them off if they visit my house? Am I exposing myself to some supernatural peril? I've previously lived in places with a mezuzah and Mary in a clamshell and don't see how this is different, but my landlady is nice and if using an alter as a spice rack is disrespectful I don't want to rock the boat.

 As I understand however, Thuy Nga has been struggling to expand it's audience base. The younger generation especially in the US is not as tied into the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War so those older songs ( aren't that appealing ). DVD sales are useless now. And the " Young " Singers that Thuy Nga has; well for one thing, they're not that good at singing, and they're not " Young ". One of Thuy Nga's " Young " Singers, Diem Suong is 33 years old. And Nhu Loan is 41. 
 Enter Myra Tran. She was not recruited by Thuy Nga. But rather, came to them through American Idol. She's now ( so far at least ) doing pretty well in Vietnam, while having some success in the US with Paris By Night.
 ​
 What do you guys think ? Can Thuy Nga adapt to new audience through Myra Tran ?

 Can you recommend a car brand or model that has this system? Thank you a lot!

Driver was driving like an asshole and I'm not surprised we got into an accident at all. Do I have any recourse here? They put us on another bus that only has room on the floor for the next 4 hours. I would expect some kind of compensation or money back for dealing with this, but as a non-vietnamese speaker I don't know what chance I'll have to actually get that.
 Edit: The bus company is Ngọc Cường VIP
 It was a head on collision with a commercial delivery truck

 Please, help me understand how Vietnam railways work, as I'm severely confused...
 I'm planning on visiting Vietnam in April, and wanted to book SE3 overnight train from Ninh Binh to Dong Hoi in advance. The problem is: I get different options depending on which website I use.
 If I try official dsvn.vn I can book a bed in 6-beds car, operated by, as far as I understand Vietnam Railways itself:
 https://preview.redd.it/wxgfmsgvj0ja1.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=246be640edd3e9d999b8fc3d4658c29828db0bb6
 If I search through baolau.com, I am presented with 4-Berth sleeping cabin, operated by New Livitrans Express:
 https://preview.redd.it/7zruwhogk0ja1.jpg?width=1143&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c6e0b44d9e051972fdff8c43c82546deb1438e3
 Finally, 12go.asia shows two separate trains, seemingly departing at the very same time: one operated by Vietnam Railways, another by Violette Express Train. Both seems to offer 4-Berth Sleepers?
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/yqnx4uq8l0ja1.jpg?width=1147&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32b9b500ac10f136f14364c06286222c51c4c4bb
 Whom should I trust? Is it a single train with carts by different operators?
 Any help will be greatly appreciated! :)

I know it's part of the tourist area, and I have seen the massage places scattered about that are obviously places catering to customers that want "special" services but the salon/haircut places seem different. Is it a gimmick? Something to draw clientele in? Get a haircut by a beautiful woman? Or is there a room in the back where someone's getting jerked off? Was trying to figure it out but I'm stumped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Americans always blamed northern Vietnam for invading southern Vietnam and that the United States simply came and supported southern Vietnam.
 They don't know why they lost that war. It is clear that Vietnam is a unified whole, there is no "southern Vietnam" and there is no "northern Vietnam". The Americans invaded Vietnam and the northern Vietnamese had the silent support of the people of South Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam was able to kick the American troops out of Vietnam.
 The Vietnamese people were in the old regime, injected with money by the US and spent it personally and without control. When the US withdrew, they lost funding, their living standards were reduced, so they were not used to it and tried to blame the communists. If the US wins, then Vietnam is now divided into two poles and will always be tense like "North Korea and South Korea" - obviously of the same origin but separated.

 So for context, I'm a high school student living in Ha Noi. Thanks to my parents' connections, I've got a part-time job that fits my schedule perfectly, and the job pays quite well for a high school student (unfortunately they wouldn't hire outsiders). From that job I've saved up more than 100mil vnd. I dont know what to do with it. I'm definitely going to a college/university in the future, so should I set it aside to pay for my tuition fee? Or should I try to learn how to invest it? An online business, maybe? 
 What would you do if u were me,,,??? Oh and im gonna set aside like 30mil in case of emergencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm set to go to Vietnam in just three weeks to teach English with VUS. It will be my first time in Vietnam. I have been given given two choices for where to work: in District 12 on the west side of the airport or in the far east of District 2. I've been told District 12 is more likely to be where I will be working.
 With that in mind, where do you recommend I live? I want to have a fairly urban lifestyle with lots to do, see, eat, drink, and shop. Districts 1, 3, 4 and such look quite nice but are super far. I'm not sure what is in District 12 as it looks quite far, so I'm not sure if it has more comfortable apartments or not. Any advice would be welcome.
 Also, is it generally easy to change your working location after a few months?

 We’re a same sex couple planning a trip to VN in a few months. I’m intending on proposing to them at a semi private venue (there may be spectators around the area, but it’s nowhere public).
 I know there’s a growing positive sentiment towards LGBTQ rights in VN, but I’m not sure how friendly locals would be to seeing something like a marriage proposal. Will I be inviting negative reactions or reception? I just don’t want to create an awkward environment for us in doing this.

 I know this might be a long shot but this is probably the only place where someone can help me with this question.
 I'm currently working on a video of my trip in Vietnam last December and i would love to start the video with someone saying something in Vietnamese. I will be using only the audio so no need to film yourself or anything. Just a recording on your phone will be fine, if possible with as little background noise as possible, although i know that's difficult in Vietnam.
 The sentence i'd like to use is something like: "Hi! I would like to tell you about my Vietnam experience. Are you ready?" But of course translated to Vietnamese. 
 If anyone is willing to help me out, that'll be amazing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I will be moving to Vietnam next month and have just been informed that my home campus for the school I will work for is in Binh Long (near Aeon mall). 
 I don’t know much about this area, as when I lived in HCM before (not for long), I lived in Thao Dien and only really went to D1/D2/D3. Also most videos I watch are mainly based in these districts as well. 
 I want somewhere that’s not extremely touristy/‘expat-y’ (like Thao Dien and most of D1), but also has plenty of stuff to do and places to eat/drink, and not too far from touristy areas I can visit if I wanted (such as Nguyen hue). I originally planned to live in D3 as it seemed to fit these criteria.
 I realise BL isn’t actually that far from these areas, but I’m guessing with traffic and other factors, it would make the daily commute quite long and tedious. 
 I’d also want somewhere with decent accommodation options for around 8tr. 
 Thanks in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just received an ESL teaching offer from a well-known company in Vietnam. I would appreciate some advice on one of the terms in the contract, as follows:
 "In addition, by law, [company name] must be able to show at such an audit as referenced in the Decree No. 03/2014/ND-CP Article 8, full and complete details of all employees who are working at [company name] […] Only original documents (they will state 'This is notarised as an original' or similar) will be returned to you at the time of your leaving [company name]. Any notarised copies will be returned after not more than 3 months."
 So, I am planning to notarise and legalise copies of my degree and CELTA certificates, and give these to the company so they can process my work permit. I don't want to spoil my originals with stamps, and I'd be reluctant to hand over my originals in any case.
 I'm from the UK, and the process for notarising and legalising copies for use in Vietnam is very time-consuming and expensive. I'm unclear why the company would need to keep these officially notarised and legalised copies rather than a digital scan or physical copy of these, if it's just for audit purposes (a copy of a copy if you like). I'm concerned that it might be a ploy to stop me obtaining a separate work permit in the event that I wanted to work for another company (after the 3 month period stipulated).
 Is this standard practice, or should I be concerned? Any experience or advice would be much appreciated.

 Bus was 30 minutes late and the "bus station" is a desk in front of a shanty restaurant/home. 
 That could be forgiven but the bus is disgusting. Nothing has been wiped down on this bus in probably years. It is old, worn, and full of germs 
 Trash all over the place, shoe bags are reused, cramped seats, no wifi no charging station, no blanket, no water, no privacy curtain, very little headroom, and an aggressive driver. Speeding and honking his horn excessively. 
 I hope I don't get foot fungus or some crap. .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm currently in Vietnam and am considering getting a Vietnamese drip coffee maker. There are hundreds of generic metal or pottery style ones, but I've found a much more unique one, hand made with copper or bronze.
 Because it is a lot more unique, it's also a lot more expensive (3 or 4 times more expensive). It feels weird to bargain because it's a small handmade store, but it is quite expensive, more money then I would like to pay. Would it be fair to ask for a cheaper price? I wouldn't cut it as low as I would with more traditional street souvenir shops. I'm not sure if there is etiquette around where to try and negotiate prices. 
 Thanks in advance!

 My wife is trying to make some veggie for our kid who is under a year old but he has a few teeth and can chew soft and small food. My wife wants to use her recipe but we live in a small town and we cannot find any brocolli here.
 What veggie do Vietnamese usually give their young child and how do you prepare it? We do have premade babies food from Avakids and Concung but we want to try some home-made solution. Any recipe would be appreciated!

I am on a very strict /r/carnivore diet due to an autoimmune condition, and I mostly eat only beef, butter and eggs. Occasionally seafood. I eat around 1 lb of meat per day, sometimes a little more.
 ​
 How difficult will it be to maintain my strict diet while in Saigon? I usually cook at home, but will probably have to eat out while there.
 ​
 When I'm desperate in the US, I can even go to McDonalds and eat the meat patties without the bun or lettuce, sauce, etc. Is the meat at McDonald's comparable to the US meat patties in quantity & quality?

 Thanks for your input & advice.

 I've read a couple of posts where people tend to lean Hanoi rather than Ho Chi Minh as a tourist destination but I am not sure. I would be fine with either. I understand Hanoi si less vibrant, more traditional, which is ok. I'm not looking for nightlife as I will be working. I don't want to exclude Ho Chi Minh though.
 It would be my first visit to Vietnam and I'm pretty excited. My concern is the weather, as I read that Hanoi tends to be colder? I'm leaving Japan for that reason, so I don't want to find myself in the same situation.
 Also, I would like to work with my laptop around the city and enjoy the famous Vietnamese coffee culture. Is it safe? I'm used to Japan where pickpocketing is not a thing and I read some posts here pointing out that snatching phones is rather common. Is that true? I would be screwed without my computer. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

 I will be in Vietnam for 3 weeks in April. I still need some equipment and I noticed that some products I am interested in are "Made in Vietnam". 
 Now I was wondering if I can buy these products cheaper in Vietnam/Hanoi than in Germany? 
 I am specifically interested in some products of the outdoor company "Patagonia".
 Thanks for the help

 I will be visiting Hanoi for 6d5n in April, spending 2days on a cruise in Ha Long Bay.
 It's our first time to Hanoi, and my parents' first time in Vietnam.
 If anyone has recommendations on eateries, interesting places to visit, or tips on navigating the city and would be so kind to share, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The continued economic turmoil there got me wondering about this. If there was civil unrest that threatened the Laos government, what would happen if China sent troops in under the guise of supporting the government or protecting their investments.? Given Laos has be a defacto puppet of Vietnam for much of it's existence and and there's always been rumours of VN troops supporting the government even in recent times against the Hmong and in the past against Thailand, would there be a response? I think it's fair to say that Vietnam at least considers Laos a part of it's sphere of influence, and while China would presumably prefer to continue to buy influence as they're currently doing in Laos and Cambodia, civil unrest could change things. Not saying it's likely, just wondering what would the reaction of the VN government and people be?

I’ll be landing in Ho Chi Minh City and that will be my planned home base but I want to travel to several places in the two weeks that I have. I’m planning on a day trip to Cu Chi and am wondering what the recommendation would be for visiting the Mekong delta. I think I could spend two days there based on other places I want to see. Would you recommend I stay a couple nights there somewhere or should I plan on maybe two different day trip tours? I would greatly value your advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last several days, I have not heard much about Vinfast other than the fact that they have discounted their VF 8 to compete with the Tesla Model Y and that they cut their North American workforce. Given that Vinfast has been more silent recently, I am curious what would happen to Vinfast and Vingroup as a whole in the coming months and years? Would Vinfast pull out of the US market and would Vinfast likely crumble just like what happened to Vinsmart? Also, if Vinfast crumbles, what does it mean for Vingroup and Vietnam as a whole?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, so I see questions recurring here on importing things from other countries into Vietnam. I do this from time to time, so figured I could tell you what to expect by documenting the last batch a little.
 First, I only import non-food items. My understanding is importing food is more difficult.
 Second, I import for personal use, and pay full duties (usually 10%). I could probably import as my company, but the paperwork is not worth the time for the fees saved, so I don't bother and just pay.
 Here's the general process:
  
Order your things. Keep the invoice (or other proof of payment) and shipping manifest. You can ship to a residential address without issue. Use a courier service, they will facilitate the paperwork. I typically use UPS or FedEx.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are planning on coming to Vietnam next year on vacation. I just read that Vietnam dose not recognize the international drivers license I can get issued here in the US. 
 We were hoping to rent a motor scooter like we did in Thailand when we visited.
 How would I go about driving legally?
 If there is no way to get a legal driving permit for my trip how big of a trouble would I get in if I got pulled over while driving?
 In Thailand my international permit was valid, but I saw others get pulled over and asked to pay a 300bhat "fine" to be on their way.
 Please any advice is welcome, I really want to obey the law and do things right. But my wife and I like to explore and hike and get off the beaten path if you will and not being able to drive ourselves around could get costly and put a real damper on our trip.
 Thanks in advance for your time and help. Cheers

So my girlfriend and a friend af hers are supposed to fly to Vietnam for a 2 week holiday but currently my girlfriend is stranded on Frankfurt airport because her express visa (or visum) application didn't get trough on time. She wasn't allowed on the flight because of this. My question to my fellow redditors is this: do you know of a way to try to get her application rushed trough. Or maybe someone knows someone that works at the governement departement that handles visa applications? Or maybe enter a second application? 
 It is a real longshot bu let's see if reddit can help.
 Eitherway i appreciatie anyone reading this.

My new company will sponsor me the costs and paperworks, (1st time for me as I usually have to shoulder the cost in my previous company. I am not a teacher btw.). This is the first time they will hire a foreigner as well so there HR is also not so familiar. They will assist me as much as they can but brunt of the research will be from my end. I jusy need to know the process in General. They will sponsor me but as much as possible not going through an agent. 
 Ill be doing this first time and I am aware Vietnam always changes rules regarding this. Is this even doable by a foreigner (not married to a Vietnamese too) so language could pose a problem... Just want to get an idea if this is even possible.

 Since leaving Texas no one has cared for my hair like my sister, Shamonica Alexander, Trina Stoker and Andise Altine, two stylist I've been seeing for years.
 Last Sunday. I had my hair braided in Vietnam by a woman from the Congo who pretty much tried her damnest to pull all the hair out of my scalp into too tight cornrows. I had to take them down two days later. 
 Well, I don't do my own hair and without my trusted hair stylists to rescue the tangled mess. I had a temper tantrum and cut my hair off. I initially wanted to shave it but I only had scissors. 
 Today, I looked for a salon to make me look more presentable but literally had people just flat out deny me service. 
 It took three attempts and a couple of salons to get someone to shape my hair but finally got this kind man to agree to it at N'Black Barbershop in Phan Thiet, Vietnam
 He was gentle. He didn't tear through my hair but most of all I felt respected. I'm super grateful to him. 
 Haven't had much luck today getting someone to give me a manicure or pedicure. Will save that for another day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, sorry if this is annoying or the incorrect place to post something like this. 
 I am currently travelling from New Zealand and accidentally left both my wallet and passport in the back of the seat in front of me on the train today.
 I caught the 15:30 train from Ga Sai Gon to Ga Binh Thuan yesterday before taking a grab further to our accommodation.
 I arrived at Ga Binh Thuan and got off the train in a rushed folly. Leaving my thungs.
 I have attempted to contact police tonight, called over 11 times, and was only received once. Before the phone was hungup.
 This is whatever, and I am sure to contact police on the phone or in person tomorrow.
 If anyone might know where my things might be/ who best to contact. 
 I will also try the train company but do not know the exact best course of action.
 Ultimately, I have travel inaurance but hope I can resolve this without resorting to it.
 Thank you kindly for any input/help/advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I came to Hanoi yesterday and I'm trying to find Vietnam-made souvenirs but all I couldn't find genuine stuff that I could buy and use on regular basis to remind me of this country. What I found were mostly toys or small plastic/wood low quality items that were painted in a rush, probably even made in China.
 What are some decent souvenirs that I can find in Hanoi? 
 Other than decorative stuff, what else I can buy, like any special spice or snack?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We arrived to Hanoi today, the hotel we had booked said they had electricity problems in our room, and showed us another room in another building far below the standard we had booked. We declined because we could see there were other hotels with good offers on Booking.com.
 Now it's 2 hours later and we have visited 4, 4 star hotels in the old quarter who all had "Superior/deluxe/.." rooms listed as available at about 70-80% discounts on Booking and when we arrived to see the room they said that it is not available.
 We decided to book some Airbnb outside old quarter instead 😅.
 Is this normal practice in Old quarter/Hanoi/Vietnam or were we just very unlucky.
