        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the Saigon to Sydney flight, at the boarding gate, after security VietJet lies to your face that there is a hundred millilitres restriction on any liquids you have purchased or filled up inside the terminal for flights to Australia
 They don't tell you at check-in either, just with security officers at the boarding gate. So if you've purchased liquids in the terminal they will confiscate them.
 If you ever have the chance, please let them know that they are full of shit, because we just checked with Australian Biosecurity here and they have confirmed that policy is an airline policy even though when you are boarding the plane they claim it is an Australian policy.
 Probably just trying to force you to purchase their cash only in-flight beverages.
 F*** VietJet.
 Edit: To be absolutely clear, we are talking about an additional restriction at the boarding gate, not the normal security check where we all know liquids must be surrendered. This applies to all liquids purchased in the terminal after security screening.

My plan was to do Thailand first(chiang mai before burning season) and then hit Vietnam in late February/march. Now I’m worried Ha Giang(what I want to do most) will be low visibility due to the smoke. Is February/March a bad time to do Ha Giang with visibility?

Surely none of them are ever anywhere near capacity? We saw nobody around apart from workers who were mostly just chilling out outside of the gated resorts. Are they laundering projects? The upkeep must be so expensive. Does anyone know what it was like on this stretch of beach before they were all built? Just curious!

 I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. I have read multiple places that Phu Quoc is overdeveloped and does not give you that "island life" feeling. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
  
Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :) Thank you for all answers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the rant. But some of the public colleges and primary-high schools in HCM City keep setting back the GODDAMN TIME in which morning classes start. The old time usually was 7:15 or 7:30am, then it back to 7am, and now it become 6:45am (Some schools like HCMC University of Industry and Trade set to as early as 6:30am)
 When asked about this decision, 2 of the most popular answers from the school speaker are: - To avoid heavy traffic --> They seriously thought "If the traffic is usually jammed at 7am, then why don't we just start the school at 6:45am?". To me, this is such a dangerous one-sided thinking, which disregard students whose houses are very far from school. Doesn't even mention student now even have less time for breakfast anymore if they wake up at 6 o'clock or later. Plus, people who don't want to deal with heavy traffic are already aware to get up early, you don't need to force everyone has to go more earlier, as long as they go to school before it starts.
  
To prevent student from coming late to class and to encourage them to wake up early--> There is no scientific research stated that the earlier the school start, the lower the student coming to school late. School in US and Europe begin at atleast 8 am so student can have good sleep, which they've done countless researches before. Again, dangerous one-sided thinking to me. As a grad student, I have twice to tripple amount of assignments despite sleeping less comparing to my time in high school. From my experience, it encourages more people to go to class late lol. My friends said this is dumb, and they ended up always going late or only go to second class (8:30 - 10:10am).
  
Sorry if you find this rant and broken English annoying. I'm 2nd year grad student and I'm tired of waking up in 5am so that I can take buses in 5:40 to get to school in time. The reason I wrote this post so I can relieve some stress from constant complaining against my school. Hope you forgive me.

Also, my roommate/best friend is getting married so I'm feeling a bit lonely idk 😕 About me: I play games but not so good with it, just average I think (LoL, Valorant, CSGO, DST, overcooked etc.). LGBT+ friendly and open minded (I do know that some ppl do claim that they're but they actually dont but this is what ppl around comment about me so I think its reliable 😂). I'm not so good with recommending cool food places cuz I mostly order food to my house 🥲 Good hidden bars, coffee shops yeah I can do. I read manga and watch anime too but wouldnt say I know many good ones. I draw as a side hobbies, not so much recently but yeah I do love art. Have tattoos, I can recommend some good tattoo artists that I mainly go to here. I have depression, anxiety, bipolar and a bit of adhd (thats a lot isnt it 🤡) but Im highly self aware and well put together most of the time. Last but not least 😂 I'm a libra.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a white guy visiting my wife’s family in a pretty rural part of Vietnam. Our sleeper bus stopped on the way and I went in to use the urinal taking the first empty one (there was probably 50 urinals mostly empty). Some guy comes in right after me and takes the urinal right next to me, then proceeds to just stare over the divider at my junk very obviously for a good 20 seconds. It was very obvious since he peaked his entire head over the divider multiple times. Eventually I gave up on peeing and left to use a stall cause I felt too uncomfortable. Any advice on what I should do in that situation? Do you say something or just walk away like I did? Is this common?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is not the right place to post this but I just want to get this off my chest to s community like this. For some context I was born in Hanoi and adopted into a US family at 8 months old - I have nothing as far of information regarding my parents, just my birthday and where I was found abandoned. I got the chance to visit Vietnam for the first time in 16 years since I was born last month. I got to experience the city and the wonderful people and I got to go to my orphanage. I got back to the US just 2 weeks ago and I just miss Vietnam so much - part of it just feels like home to me and I just miss the whole vibe and general culture of the country. I have never traveled to a place where I just felt so in place and “normal” with people who were genuinely interested in me and cared about me. It honestly was an experience nice and feeling that I really cannot put into words. I am not normally a person to express my emotions like this but I just had to get it out somehow sorry this was more of a post about my feelings and more about myself 😅. Anyways thanks for reading - sending love ❤️.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrived at Tan Son Nhat and called a GrabCar to my hotel in District 1 since it was 100k vnd opposed to the 300k-400k vnd quoted by the taxi stands.
 After a few minutes trying to find my driver in the parking lot at the Arrivals exit, he helped load my full size luggage and medium totebag into the trunk while I carried my pet carrier with me into the back seat.
 About 5 minutes into the ride, the driver motions a hand gesture towards his tummy and realize he is trying to say he has a stomach ache and needs to find a restroom en route. He gets on his phone and coordinates with another driver to take me in their car instead. We stop at a gas station, and I get out with my pet carrier and begin to get into the other car. My driver opens the trunk to retrieve my luggage, closes the trunk lid right away and holds up a 100k bill to show me as he hands it to the new driver. I am in agreement as it seems fine with the exchange of funds to the new driver, and I pay the first driver once my ride completes.
 As I am about to enter the new car, I realize I am missing my large totebag. I tell my original driver, hey I'm missing my other bag. So I go over to the car and he opens the trunk and reaches in and retrieves my totebag. I see the totebag is placed in the trunk in a small, recessed area that just seemed odd. I didn't think much of all this at first, but at the end of the day, this incident has kept me thinking I was trying to be robbed. My totebag contained all my essential items.
 tldr: grabcar drivers says he is sick minutes into a ride, gets me a replacement car and driver and forgets to transfer all my luggage to new car.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
 Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :)
  
Thank you for all answers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I sorta want to learn to read and write chữ nôm, and that would requite me to learn Chinese. What dialect would I learn? Before the arrival of the Jesuits and French, Vietnamese was written in chữ nôm, which were Chinese characters modified to write Vietnamese. In order to read and write this script, one probably had to have a good understanding of Chinese. But what dialect of Chinese did chữ nôm writers speak? It probably was not Mandarin, as that was spoken in northern China, ~2000 miles away from Vietnam. Chinese rule of Vietnam ended in the 10th century, so there must have been some drift in the Chinese dialect the literate Vietnamese knew and the dialects the Chinese spoke.

I want to start from the end and say that ultimately nothing happened to us, and we continue to enjoy our trip here.
 My partner and I are visiting Vietnam and we are currently in Hanoi. Last evening we were walking around the Hoàn Kiếm area, when at some point a man seemed to have offered us something (I did not hear/understand). I have simply politely responded "no thanks" and my partner and I continued walking. From that point, I could see from the corner of my eye he was walking behind us. We did not interact further. At some point, he passed us and was now ahead of us by a few steps. Whenever we stopped (to look at our map, cons…]]></summary>

 Do you think it's impossible in my case to get a job in Vietnam? What about the visa?
 I am a French Software developer with 3 years of experience, both in France and Germany.
 I am fluent in English and French. I know that recruitment policies rightfully prioritize locals, but I would appreciate your opinion about this topic! or even some feedbacks.
 Thanks for your answers :)

I'm not accusing the entire sub of being these stereotypers as most of the replies are level-headed, but there are still some things I just wanna get off my chest as a non-native who was raised in Vietnam.
  
The accusations of racism.
  
Whilst it is true that Vietnam is a racist country, I find it absolutely ridiculous that people seem to be stereotyping the entire nation as being racists. I myself whilst not exactly dark skinned, have seen a lot of darker skinned Viets living life normally. Matter of fact- a big majority of Viets are tanned, regardless of class.

On the way, we see a bike lying on the side of the road. I immediately stop and see two kids (maybe 17-18) lying there in a puddle of blood. I stop the bike, jump off, and run over to them and notice that one kid has two huge holes in his head and his face is completely covered in blood. The other kid is alright, just a scratch across his face from the pavement, but visibly shocked trying to shake his friend. Some people are standing in the distance just looking, while his head is lying on the side of the road.
 I hold his head up, his blood is pouring all over me. I try to wave to people passing by, and every single person stops, looks, shrugs, and keeps going. Not a sin…]]></summary>

 I have tried drugs pretty much from every class. Weed, traditional psychedelics, stimulants, dissociatives and sedatives. I have experience with relatively high dose of shrooms and LSD, also with vaping and smoking DMT. I'm familiar with the feeling those all share to some extent. I have done high dose of edible cannabis multiple times too.
 Tonight I was alone in a bar in Vietnam and a guy asked me to join their table. I joined them and we enjoyed some beer and tried to have a conversation even though they didn't really speak english. They had a shisha on the table and offered it for me and I smoked it few times. It was my first time doing shisha, everything seemed just normal, it tasted like mellow strawberry.

 I know it sounds weird, but I figure other tourists have tshirts (which I do as well), but buying a jacket is unique, and it really reminds me of being in Vietnam.
 My friend is refusing to help me look for a BE jacket this time; he says it’s the “uniform of the poor”.
 So, I’m on my own on this endeavour. How would I buy one, despite not being able to speak Vietnamese?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in vietnam for over 2 weeks now and I've been really depressed about the racism I'm facing here. To give some context, I'm chinese and indian, quite dark skinned, female. 
 The counts of racism I've faced here is absolutely disheartening, maybe because of my background, I tend to notice the implicates of it. Other - I've been really well behaved, trying to break the misconceptions about my countrie(s) not because I deliberately want to, but because that's how I am. I'm introverted, am always polite, tip well, do not indulge in the bad stuff. 
  
At the hotel I was in, I saw white tourists get upgraded and also an Asian Australian man get upgraded (their original rooms were not available). In my case I was asked to wait 3 hours for my room, when I asked if I could pay for a better room, they happily obliged. This happened on the same day, around the same time. 
 
Customer service - Specually in hotels again, I saw how other customers were treated over me. Unfortunately, I did notice a theme going around with the skin tone. I saw a couple who came in after me order much more elaborate dishes, it was only after they finished almost eating, was I served my very simple dish. 
 
The cherry on top, I took a tour to a popular tourist guide with a English speaking tour guide, he went on to speak about how brown skin is not considered beautiful in vietnam, that it's ugly, relates to poor and bad behavior as he himself was brown, he did not have good experiences in vietnam with his love life, job etc.. this really broke my heart. This country is supposed to have the kindest of people, having read the previous threads too, I didn't expect to have this experience in Vietnam of all places. 
 
 I just wanted to share this with all the people of colour who keep asking this question if the vietnamese are racist. Here's your answer. Ofcourse, it's not as blatant, or direct, but hurtful nonetheless.

 I’d love to hear if you guys have other tips for us on our situation. Thanks!

 I m european and i will travel to Vietnam by plane to sign on container vessel, i m a seafarer. I have in my checked luggage a 2.5kg sealed bag containing GymBeam True Whey ( protein powder ). One friend of my father scared me and told me that custom agents are very corrupt and if they see that I m european, they will demand money and if i refuse they will even go far as replacing my protein powder with some drugs to convict and jail me. 
 I told him that he s crazy but now i m a bit worried. Can i take my protein with me or should i leave home. I would probably come by plane from Instanbul or Doha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, first of all, I'm a Vietnamese. Using English here, because well, why the hell not?
 University in this nation just feels forced. Not like "conscription" stuff but, keeps organizing random events and forces students to participate, and if not, deduct bunch of "diem ren luyen" or whatever. I just feel like students should have the rights to whether to go or not. Like recently, my university had some sort of Shoppe-sponsored event and of course, to make the sponsors happy, they force every students to attend, standing in the sun for 1 hour then listen to annoying love-related songs about bunch of "I love you then you dump me" non-sense. Or forcing students to clean up construction debris in the university. Wow, unpaid working. 10/10, Law university. And upcoming, another sport event that if they didn't threaten to deduct points, probably no one would attend because 90% of the students aren't bothered to wake up at 8AM in Sunday, just to watch bunch of fellow university students playing badmintons and running.
 I understand the morality behind the non-sense of that points system, for "đánh giá về phẩm chất chính trị, đạo đức, lối sống của sinh viên trên năm mặt đánh giá" but using this so that the teachers can prove that "my university organizes events and the students are totally not enforced to come and this will do very well for publicity" is not really a good excuse to use this points system. Because some university students have their own life to deal with and should not be forced to participate in events that for a lack of better words, they don't give a f- about (there're defo better words). Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Students have their own life and you having free time doesn't mean you should torture the students.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to vietnam next week and I went to search up on items to declare while clearing the customs. One of the items is cash.
 Apparently vietnam customs allow you to bring $5000USD or equivalent foreign currencies in cash without a need to declare. But for their own currency, they only allow travellers to bring in 15million VND which is $620USD equivalent. Anymore than 15million VND in cash has to be declared. That is so weird? Anyone has any experience of bringing in more than 15million dongs in vietnam? Do you actually need to declare? If you did, what did they do? Do they just straight up confiscate the difference?
 Edit: People seem confused so I’ll explain further: 
 Guys I am talking about arrivals. Not departure. I’m BRINGING IN 30million dong cash to vietnam to SPEND. I’m NOT BRINGING VND OUT of vietnam. I dont understand why would they limit the bringing of their currency that’s the most legal and accepted to be used in their country so severely. It’s like they are trying to create more business for the money changers there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it just me or have you noticed the same. It seems to me that the driving style in Vietnam seems to be slower then for example in Thailand or the west. I don’t know how to describe it. I felt the same in Laos. Some sort of socialist driving style. Maybe it is also because there are so many motorcycles and most look identical. What’s your take on it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can there be widespread development and well-being in a socialist country like Vietnam?
 Vingroup seems to me to be the classic case of parastatal corruption. They promised to build homes for the people by converting rural areas but then built luxury homes that are inaccessible and currently empty. 
 It seems to me that in VN no one cares about voting and that all they have faith in the government. 
 It seems to me to be a country destined to become a new China if the people do not demand democracy and the fight against corruption. 
 At today we never saw a country without democracy grow up with a stable well-being and in my opinion VN people they need to fight more for their rights.
 What do you think? Why Vietnamese trust this gov?

Outpatient treatment 
 Inpatient treatment 
  Medical evacuation to my home country 
 Repatriate remains
  
Is outpatient coverage necessary here as treatment in Vietnam is super cheap? 
 How long should the waiting period for cancer or illnesses? Some insurance companies have a 12 month waiting period for cancer which is ridiculous in my opinion. 
 Thank you so much

We were thinking of taking the train up the coast and stopping off at Sapa, Nha Trang, Hue, and still deciding. We like to adventure, eat good food, and not be in touristy scenes if possible! Where we else should we definitely stop and where have you stayed that you enjoyed? Ok with private rooms in hostels, hotels, other unique experiences. Should we book ahead of time or wait til we get there? Thank you 💞💞💞

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been here for a while now and I am honestly SO tired of being misled by top tier hotel reviews online that turn out to be rigged or fake. Every “well-reviewed” hotel or accommodation (even higher end ones) I’ve stayed in was so terrible (or subpar at best) despite raving reviews online which leads me to believe it’s all fake and manipulated. 
 Then, whenever you leave an honest review or comment on booking.com or google that isn’t a 9 or 10, hotel staff will literally track you down on your personal whatsapp or e-mail to emotionally blackmail you urging you to delete or edit your comment, or worse! They will even threaten you! 
 Pictures on websites are insanely misleading too and idk why but staff always give off this insanely fake vibe with weird fabricated personas they sport because they they think this somehow pleases tourists? (Spoiler: IT DOES NOT, everything just feels pretty off and not genuine at all).
 All very exhausting. I’m leaving Vietnam soon and couldn’t be happier to leave this all behind me. 
 Sorry I just had to rant for a moment after countless disappointing experiences.

 Everything I read on this sub looks delicious. Just any tips on what I should do are appreciated. I’m not just going to eat pho or Bahn Mi. Things with fresh herbs and noodles/soups are interesting to me. I like spice and not American guy spicy. I don’t need to eat meat with everything. 
 I have a weekend to explore. Thanks I appreciate it.

 I’ve done it so you don’t have to :)
 Turns out every shop has slightly different prices on Apple products.
 ShopDunk has both the lowest prices AND provide tax certificate so you can get your further 10% off at the airport.
 I paid 9.9M VND for an Apple Watch S9. After tax rebate it’s 9M, about 25% cheaper than I’d pay for it in the UK.
 iPhone 15 works out at around £800, so 20% cheaper than in the UK.
 As far as I can tell there shouldn’t be any regional differences in hardware or software, albeit Apple warranty isn’t international as far as I can tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a foreigner, I wish to get the general perspective of Northerners and Southerners. I have lived in Hanoi 7 years and had spent 8 months full time last year in Saigon. As the title suggests, I am genuinely curious as to why? Granted Saigon has been renamed as Ho Chi Minh City, and some suggested it some sort of a reminder to everyone. Is this really the case? I also met people who still refer to the city as Saigon. 
 It does not mean I don't see him in Hanoi, just not as much as in Ho Chi Minh City.

 She gets upset about things to do with her parents back home in veitnam, but when I ask about them, I get told not to worry about them. 
 Been with her for nearly 2 years, and married since January. I could understand the general secrecy if it were a relatively new relationship, and kind of has expectations that the secrecy would kinda die off after a few months, but it never did.
 There's a whole bunch if questions, that I could never get answers from her on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question
 Why do so many Vietnamese feel the need to come right next to you when there are so many other spaces. 
 Example: - I'll be in a cafe that is totally empty and a noisy Vietnamese family with kids come in. There's a 99% guarantee that out of all the empty tables, they'll choose to come and sit right next to me.
  
Motorbike parking will be totally empty but I can guarantee someone will park their bike right next to mine (and bang my mirrors while doing so)
 
I'll go to the park to relax while it is mostly quiet. Despite being empty, the one group of Vietnamese will almost definitely come and sit right near me. 
 
 Is it a deep rooted fear of being alone or just a desire to piss off other people? (Joke)
 The urinal meme has never been more true.

This morning I was getting a train in hcmc and wanted to double check everything was okay with my ticket there was someone getting help when I arrived at the customer service desk and 2 people behind me so very clearly in a line and an older man walked infront of me and then after that it happened again with another older man. Being from the UK and how we queue this is seen as being very rude but is it a common thing here?

 I like my public hospital. It is cheaper than the private hospitals. 
 I recently bought cheap private insurance here in Vietnam and they rejected my claim. 
 The sales rep for that insurance lied to me about my insurance coverage. Due to my budget, I had to buy this private insurance. 
 My current insurance company will not cover for pre-existing conditions. 
 My employer only gives me accident insurance. They do not give me health insurance which sucks. 
 I do not drive. 
 Outpatient is cheap here. 
 My budget is tight so I wanr to save as much money as possible. 
 I am wondering if public health insurance is enough. 
 Do I need to still buy private insurance in addition to public health insurance? 
 Thanks!

 Now that I’m adult and traveling to Da Nang I’d like to buy some. I don’t care for them to be tailored, it’s just a pj. I’m looking for a nightgown, short and tank top set, and maybe a robe. And maybe some gold jewelry if it is affordable.
 Are there shops I can buy this already made? Any store/address recommendations? Even if I go to Hoi An, I only have time for one day so they would have to make it same day by 7pm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day, I found on the Internet such a thing as Autoblow Ultra. I want to try it out, but they say on the Internet that legally a thing of this nature will not be allowed through customs, otherwise you won’t end up with problems. Has anyone already encountered similar “problems” and is there a way to get the desired item while in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know Vietnamese are pragmatic and that chữ quốc ngữ is way more practical for everyday use, learning and teaching. Nevertheless, I wonder how the Vietnamese state, the society and individual are interested in their Vietnamese cultural heritage. Do people offer it at school like how many western nations may also offer to teach a dead language like latin? Do people use it for modern poems and literature?
 What I personally love about Chinese style characters isn't just the aesthetics, but the connection and meaning that each character holds. They don't just decorate the temples and literature of the past. For example, did you knew that the family name Ngô 吳 does not refer to maize/corn 玉米 , which is also called ngô in Vietnamese? I did not for a long time. I think the usage of Chinese characters can make some differentiation in phonetically same sounding words and its kinda neat.
 I also find concepts and attempts like Quốc âm tân tự and chữ Nôm mới very interesting.

 I'm wondering how expats living in Vietnam handle their health insurance?
 I am moving to Vietnam soon for work (my employer does not provide health coverage), and I plan to take out some travel insurance initially to cover any accidents or emergencies, and then find a health insurance plan provider after I arrive. Not sure if this it the best way of doing it though.
 Does anyone have any recommendations or advice? I'm interested to hear how you insure yourself and which providers you recommend.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had the worst train experience in my whole life. I and my friend went to buy the bunk beds for our 7 hour trip. The toilets are too filthy as they pissed all over it and there is not enough space, it likes you are locked inside a cramped closet with piss filled every fucking corner. The train shaked and as it stopped it almost made me fall into those piss filled corner in the toilet. The noise I could endure but there was a family with little kids who kept kicking the wall during the night. The staff smuggled people so they can charge 10$ per bunk bed while when we officially bought the tickets it was 30$ per seat. As we only bought 2 seats, the 10$ illegal bought beds above us hung their feets right above our head, kicking in the beds so we could not sleep for the whole night. And the train staff, seeing that we realized she smuggled people onto the train and felt we bought our beds so she couldn't make anymore money, treated us as garbage and was being rude the whole ride. I doubt they ever change their attitude or service so I won't ever get on a train in Vietnam for my long ride anymore. It was not worth it. I was very tired and both disgusted and angry with suck an awful train service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was walking around Saigon exploring random convenience stores in Tan Dinh and D3 between meetings, and noticed how most western branded goods are priced almost as much (if not more than) as they would sell in the US. 
 ​
 Products like Cerave, Cetaphil, St Ives, etc are all priced at US levels, which is something I've never seen in other Asian countries. In China or India, Unilever or P&G would try to match local prices, but in VN they are completely unabashed in price gouging. 
 ​
 While I do understand that these would be luxury products for most Vietnamese, this is the first time I've ever seen this lack of price localization almost anywhere in the developing world.

 This is an old performance by someone who is not Vietnamese. The caption is in Russian, but I was able to translate it via Google Translate. The part pertaining to the lyrics state that she sings the following:
 "It’s wonderful to love like this in the spring, when the expanse of fields blooms. The valleys turn green again, the nightingale captivates with the song. Leave me, leave me, I’m in a hurry to go to the market. I won’t hide it, I love you, but it’s a pity I can’t stay... "
 The caption goes on to say that the song was created it back in 1957, when the performer participated in a tour of Vietnam as part of a delegation of Soviet art masters. It states that she is wearing the national costume donated to her by the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture.
 I am curious if the song is accurate. Is she really singing in Vietnamese? I don't know enough to be able to tell myself. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 So I’m in VN for a few months and don’t have much friends yet with similar interests. I do love going to experimental music places and raves back in Europe. Something that I would do with friends mainly and also alone. I’m born European and so know the culture and social codes even in underground spaces.
 So now that I’m on my own here in VN for ths first time ever, I found a bunch of parties I would like to attend, at locations for example: The Observatory, Arcan and The Bar Commune Lab.
 Now all my europe friends are like ‘you should NOT go alone,cause its dangerous to do things alone as a cute female in a third world country’ and in the meanwhile all my friends who are from south east asia themselves, that I met in Europe, are excited for me te explore on my own in VN and make new friends by just showing up here.
 So, what do yall think? Can I go around on my own? Ofcourse a lot of basic female going out things apply like, dont accept drinks from strangers and stuff but idk, I dont feel like Vietnam is that unsafe and these spaces seem experienced when it comes to internationality?
 My viet language is super beginner tho..

 I was talking to my coworker about houses in China, and he said that Ho Chi Minh District 1's prices are ridiculous, given that for the same price (let's say 500k), you could buy a 1500 sqft house in let's say, Columbia MD, where many people agree is a good place to live.
 Or a 3000 sqft house in Sugarland TX, which let's face it, is amongst the best values for money in America given you get a top rated school system (according to USNews), being in a rich and educated community, and having quite good weather rather than hot/humid weather even in the winter and tropical diseases.

 I was searching for Phu Quoc but came across some threads saying it's all fake and overpriced (?). Do you recommend it or not?
 I'm not looking for party or busy places, just something chill, where I can walk to some beaches, have a beer and maybe rent a bike to explore the surroundings.
 Alternatives are destinations like Phuket but it seems the weather is not so good there now.
 The only thing to keep in mind is that I need to work, so good wifi is mandatory.
 Really appreciate your help. Thanks!

I am currently riding from HCMC to Hanoi and rented a bike from Tigit. They have an interesting option where one can rent a guide for $140 a day (plus all expenses for the guide). I was maybe thinking if anyone would want to join, we could split the cost of the guide and have our own smaller tour. This would not be an "easy-rider" situation and you would have to ride your own bike. Tigit also rents bikes and gear for a fee. Link below for the guide. Thank you.

Some people here toss around this strange idea of "western" and it just feels way off to me. It's like "western" only accounts for the image of the USA. As a German, I don't feel represented by that concept at all.
 Germany and the USA are worlds apart politically and culturally, despite both being tagged as "western". Alone in Europe there is so much cultural differences.
 And then there's the comment sections, turning into what feels like an active war. You got one group throwing a bunch of untrue, mostly negative stuff about Vietnam, and another group firing back with a pro-Vietnam vibe while dissing "the West", saying so much stuff that basically only applies to the USA.

So a bit of background information: We both live in the Netherlands he goes to school here and says he has both a Dutch and a Vietnamese passport and he is now 18. But he told me that when he was 17 he needed to go to Vietnam for mandatory military service for a year and that he was a Sergeant-Major. Is this even possible because from what I could find you can only start service in Vietnam when you are between 18-25 and I doubt that becoming a Sergeant-Major is easy. So is he telling the truth or is he just telling some made up story for some "clout"?

 Another time, I rode through Tan Binh probably around 10pm when there was a dude completely naked and playing with himself at the side of the road. 
 In both instances, neither traffic nor pedestrians seemed to even bat an eyelid. In other countries, people would be alarmed or shocked but in Vietnam it didn't even warrant a second glance. Is this something normal or are people just too afraid to do anything?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im planning to write an article related to this topic, hence would like to collect your sharing.
 I observe that social media (especially Facebook watch) is definately creating a negative personality of my parents and other middle aged adults in general. I saw them watch several meaningless and no value contents (in many topics, for example: cancer maker (without any verification), some dudes telling you how to live a life lol) then they share to us with the thought that it’s a reference that we should follow and absorb. It’s hard to say but I feel like the social media is changing the middle-aged people’s mental health. I think because they aren’t growing up with the social media like us (late of Gen Y and on) so they are lacking of “pick and choose tools” when using social media. They are the most vulnerable social media users I think. What u think bout this? Let’s share some thoughts or any practical case?

 Firstly, I just want to know is Ho Chi Minh cashless friendly ? I’m there for 5 days only to shop, eat and chill. Secondly, My plan is to change 50% of my currency 50% in card. Is that a good or bad idea ?
 Lastly, if they do accept cards are they typically the paywave that don’t require me to insert the card and enter they key?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 I'm thinking of buying Apple Watch and would like to ask several questions on how it is suitable for usage in Vietnam for my purposes.
 What I have: iPhone + 'SimA' and going to buy Apple Watch Series 9 41mm with eSim support (and I put there 'SimB').
 - Can I leave the phone at home and go out with the watch + 'SimB' only and be able to see messages on facebook and Zalo and write/record basic replies (without having any kind of headset)?
 - Can I see/reply to calls/sms which come to 'SimA' (which is in the phone) when I'm outdoors with the watch only (the phone is at home)?
 - Can I use the phone to answer calls/sms which come to the 'SimB' (which in the watch)?
 - Can I use the watch to order grab car/bike and see how the car/bike is approaching on the map?
 - Can I make Sacombank money transfers using the watch only?
 I know that there are Grab/FB/Zalo apps for Apple Watch but I'm curious how they are actually usable (especially on 41mm watch screen)? Also it is not clear if there is a 'full' Sacombank app (or Apple Pay support only).
 I appreciate any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my wife where travelling the Mai Chau valley, just enjoying the view, going through the villages. One of the houses was blasting dance music, we went over and saw the locals are having a birthday.
 For some reason they really, really, really wanted us to join them and we figured why not. So we danced a little and they immediately offered us their booze (don't really know what it was, maybe banana wine?), we drank one glass but they really really wanted us to drink more, at some point we really had to push them off. When we figured we want to leave they grabbed us by the hands (as if to keep on dancing with us) and they where actually holding unreasonable firmly, one might even call it violently. At the end we managed to shake them off and just wave them goodbye.
 It's important to note, the whole settings where very friendly, there where Children, women and elderly in the party, so we don't think those guys had bad intentions and do us harm. We do wonder why they where so keen on having us on their celebration and why the hell where they holding so strongly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about the opinions of Vietnamese people on relationships. The motivation behind my inquiry is that many of my wife's friends have experienced divorce, or remarriage, or are seeking partners with more financial stability than their exes. some of their husbands, who happen to be my friends, claim a common issue of feeling controlled. 
 In contrast, I have been clear with my wife that either of you is free to walk away without strings attached if the relationship reaches a point of no hope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep reading on different websites that HCMC has nightlife that almost rivals Bangkok, how it's the second biggest party spot in SEA, etc.
 Just got here last night. Bui Ven seems to have more people in the street than the actual clubs and it all started to die down at midnight. Lush was tiny and about 75% empty. Faham just had some small groups sitting down with balloons, Observatory was dead...
 For a Friday night after all the hype I saw online I was a bit disappointed. Am I just going to the wrong places or does Vietnam just not have a nightlife oriented culture?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I’ve been travelling to Vietnam for a few weeks now and loving it so far. I want to have a chilled weekend in Ho Chi Minh City.
 In Hanoi, I loved to chill at Hoan Kiem Lake - I just had a nice time just sitting/walking around there and I found that locals would approach to practice their English with me there which made it extra nice.
 If there somewhere similar in HCMC? I’m in District 1 but don’t mind wandering.
 All suggestions welcome! Thanks!
 EDIT: it doesn’t even have to be the whole day/weekday but is there somewhere that’s just nice to walk around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I will be visiting Vietnam in a few weeks (Dec 26 to Jan 11) and I will be in a group of 3. I was wondering if it is better to book activities, tours, transport etc. in advance or if it would be alright to just book when we're over there?
 Mostly just want to know the best way to go about this as we're all excited and a little bit nervous and I would like things to go as smoothly as possible!
 Thank you

 For anyone with knowledge on this, what í that like? Is there bullying in the local schools? Anything to worry about? What can you share?

Are they there to sire additional chickens, to be a watchdog for security purposes, etc.? From my and I’m sure 99.99% other neighboring residents’ perspective, it’s just another source of rude, inconsiderate noise (as probably hundreds of people are subjected to it; fortunately I’m not right next door, but I feel for those who are). Or should it be regarded as just another source of local “color?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit Vietnam brains trust. Hoping someone can help me out, with quite a specific and niche type question in regards to a Vietnam eSim provider for mobile/cell phones.
 I was in a rush flying out of Vietnam last week. My physical Vietnamese sim cardoesn'tnt support global roaming.
 I need a local Vietnam number (eSim only as I'm not in Vietnam atm) to receive calls/text messages while overseas (ie needs to offer global roaming capability).
 Seems the majority of eSim providers for Vietnam, don't offer global roaming + local Vietnamese number. 
 Zalo, Skype and Viber are the less preferred options, as I need to be contactable on a local Vietnamese number.
 Think I'm out of luck and will have to use alternative methods, till I'm back in Vietnam. Unless someone on here can help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Cross-posted from r/trans)
 Hi! I’m new to the community but would like some help choosing a name from the members of this sub!
 I am a 2nd generation Vietnamese-American with both parents from south Vietnam. I have gone through many names during my time of being kinda out as trans-masculine and all of them have been either generically white male names or just English words. I’m hoping to legally change my name soon to something more permanent and closely tied to my culture. I have been immersed in Vietnamese culture and tradition ever since I was a child but when I was born I was given an American name instead of a Vietnamese one. I used to be grateful for this because it reduced the amount of bullying I got for being Asian but now I just want a name that connects to the culture and people that raised me.
 I’d just like some suggestions from other Vietnamese people on male names :) I’d also accept and consider just object names! I used to go by Zero at one point so I’m no stranger to non-name sounding names lmao
 Thank you in advance! :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This accident happened about 10 meters in front of me today and in real time. Probably a 3-4 year old kid standing on the motorcycle with both his parents sitting in front and behind him, and as always, he wasn't wearing a helmet but the parents were.
 The dad driver did a close maneuever to overtake a public bus but probably forgot about the son standing right behind him. Consequently, the kid's head collided with the side mirror of the bus, causing him to lose balance and fall off the bike. But lucky enough, he fell AWAY from the bus or else it would be a much bloodier scene.
 I don't get this, you can afford a bike, you can afford two helmets each for yourself and your wife, you can afford clothes, you can probably afford a smartphone as well, but a child's helmet crosses the line? Here's an unpopular opinion, if you can't financially & mentally afford a child's helmet, then you probably shouldn't have a child. Don't even get me started on letting your child stand on a moving bike. It was a cringey horror scene but I kinda felt like it should happen more often for them to finally learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 First of all, my situation:
 I've been living in HCMC for almost 2 years now but I'm thinking of leaving. My reasons are the high rent, the noise and air pollution, and the traffic.
 Rent here is the highest in Vietnam I think, higher than in Ha Noi I've been told.
 About noise, I tried lots of places and honestly outside of "luxury" high rise appartments, other places are affected by noise at night or early morning to the point of being unlivable. I got really depressed once because a place a rented had neighbours arguing all day, karaoke and loud drunk talking at night, funerals,... 
 About air pollution, it's worse these days, I can see smog most time I look outside from a high enough floor.
 Traffic is also getting worse. I came to HCMC right at the end of COVID quarantine so it was somewhat normal then, then it got gradually worse. 
 Now my question: I'm considering moving to another city, probably Da Nang. Is Da Nang really better in terma of rent, noise, air and traffic? I've been there once and think it's better but it was just a short trip so I'm not sure, heard some stories about karaoke in Da Nang so I want to hear more from everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Am I being scammed somehow ?
 I just moved into a studio apartment in D1 in HCMC. Got a decent price: around 7.5mil per month. Just a small bedroom and bathroom, no living room or anything. 
 I wanted to check the electric meter outside my room so I turned off electronics and it wasn’t moving. So far so good. 
 I don’t use the fridge , so it’s been off the whole month. Most of my electric usage is for my A/C that runs about 12 hours per day. Otherwise the only other electricity I use is for charging my laptop, or my projector if I’m using it (rarely).
 Electric bill comes in at the end of the month a staggering 1 million vnd! I speak to a neighbor from the house next door. He says he’s paying around 400k for the entire house! 
 Now I know the price per KW is 3.000 vnđ, but the landlords make a profit by charging 4.000 vnd. So I’m thinking that either my A/C is super congested and using up a ton of electricity or my landlord is somehow screwing me. 
 Any thoughts? I will be talking to him about this issue in 2 days when I pay rent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Vietnam!
 Sorry for another travel post but after reading through the sub, and watching videos I figured making a post may be the best method since I have some unique elements to my inquiry.
 I spent most of the year working on a project that took a lot of my time, it wrapped in November but I have quite a bit of vacation to use up now. I've always wanted to go to Vietnam. I was in a LT relationship that recently ended and so that factored in with the work leave is making me think now may be a good time however, it'd be a solo trip and pretty spontaneous due to time.
 My travel window would be likely Dec 8 - 21st. Outside of the US, I've traveled to Asia three times (Japan once, Korea twice). I did solo travel to Japan but I knew very basic Japanese and don't know any Vietnamese.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm going to Vietnam in a month, I'm from Italy so EURO.
 I have Curve, Revolut and BBVA and none of them charge me for exchange fees or atm withdrawal abroad.
 I've read though that in Vietnam every time you withdraw from an ATM or pay with a card you are charged an extra ~3% fee from the Vietnamese bank. Is that so?
 What's the most convenient option? Is exchanging EURO at the airport the cheapest option?
 ​
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm from New Zealand and learned recently that the Cham people speak an Austronesian language, which is the same linguistic family as Te Reo Māori from NZ. 
 What I've also noticed is that Vietnamese seems to have some loan words from the Cham language, like:
 Eye - mắt - mblak (Cham). Mata (Māori) can mean face, but may sometimes refer to eye, eyebrow, or looking out. The Cham word for face is also mata.
 This - này - ne (Cham) - nei (Māori) (usually used as tēnei, but also by itself, like in ā te pō nei (this night).
 There are quite a few more that I found.
 Because of these similarities, could there be more of a Cham influence on Vietnamese than I thought? Is it common knowledge that the Cham language has influence on Vietnamese and vice versa?

I had been using a book to figure out what all fruits can be added (as main or substitutions) in it and it mentioned figs as one of the substitution that can be added on the tray and it stuck with me and I made a design with that as well. Now I found some websites that claimed figs are not used at all and its making me nervous as I don't have enough time to remove it from the design before I am to showcase the collection for marking. So before I chuck it out of my collection, I thought I should come here amd ask you guys. What do you think I should do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning a trip to Hanoi for 2week trip in march. I plan to have some luxury stays and some very minimal cheap stays to get a feel of what I can bare. I am getting tired of US politics and crazy events lately. I want to learn more the resilience and beliefs of Vietnamese and maybe Buddhism. 
 Ultimately I want to see if I can be retired snowbird in Vietnam Jan-April or live in the region (Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, ect..). I am 53 and healthy and athletic. I raised two wonderful adult ladies and separating from a controlling spouse. I want to be free and take someone that we can mutually take care of each other. I want to connect with authentic people/community that support each other and live a less complicated life.
 I am a Korean migrated to US and I never felt I belonged. I look Korean but white in the inside with my upbringing. I am looking back now and want to meet people like me. Think differently, feel, love. I am looking for friends to hang out and eat and go to clubs. New connections that will pull me back to Asia and feel at home. 
 Question 1. What would be better than Hanoi for value for money compared to other Asian cities. 
 Question 2. Do you find it's easy to make good authentic friendship with travelers and local people? Is it easy to date and any advice on best way to find activities with other singles wanting to connect in Hanoi. Connect and travel together?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'd like to learn Vietnamese but I don't know where to start. I have no prior exposure of the language or country whatsoever so I really am clueless about Vietnamese culture. However after doing a little research I found out that people are divided on what the standard dialect of Vietnamese is. Google articles say the standard dialect is Northern Vietnamese but will also tell you that you should learn the Southern dialect instead and materials that teach you the Northern dialect I've noticed are kind of frowned upon. I really have no idea what these mean Which sounds stupid I know but that's why I'll take the time to learn. Does it really matter which dialect I will learn between those two? Are the differences between the two dialects really that noticeable to the point of miscommunication? I also noticed that learning Vietnamese is also not as accessible as learning other languages like Chinese or German so if anyone has/know any free resources to learn Vietnamese then I'd appreciate if you'll share it in the comments... Thankss

 It seems to me that the priority line is mainly for aircrew staff. Do these immigration line "fast-track" services "bribe" immigration officials so customers could use that line also?
 I've also heard that the line closest to the priority immigration line (heard towards the left) tends to be quickest. Has anyone experienced that to be true?

 The wife and I want to go to vũng tàu soon. I'm Người nước ngoài, and she's originally from Vietnam but grew up abroad, where we met. We now live in Vietnam.
 She remembers Vũng tàu public beaches with food vendors, beer vendors, chair vendors, etc. I've been to beaches like this, and while you always need to watch yourself from getting ripped off, I enjoy having the option to buy some food and drinks from people coming up right to your spot on the beach and the variety of stuff that they might bring. She remembers it fondly too. But I've read that the govt has possibly restricted vendors from these beaches? Is this true? And are there no beaches that have these vendors? We're trying to plan the trip and I can't find any real answers can someone help me?
 Nước ngoài translation:
 Tôi (người nước ngoài) và vợ muốn đi du lịch ở vũng tàu để đi biển, đi chơi, ăn hải sản, v.v... vợ tôi nhớ vũng tàu có nhiều người bán đồ ăn, bìa, thuê ghế ở biển. Tôi đã đi biển khác mà có người bán, và tôi rất là thích Những mà, tôi mới đọc mầ chín phủ không cho phép người bán trên biển nữa. Có đúng không?.
 Sorry if that Vietnamese gives anyone heartburn. Thanks for the advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finhay is an investing app that my wife and I came across a few years back. The interest rates are about 2% higher than traditional banks. We put a fair bit of money in it, collected nice interest, and used it to pay off our mortgage. As we start building up our savings again, we are questioning whether to continue saving money in Finhay at higher interest rates (~8%) or to put it in traditional banks (~6%), which of course have risks of their own in Vietnam's relatively wild west financial system.
 I'd love to hear any insight you all have on the safety & risks of Finhay. Thanks so much!

I feel as though google translate makes it lose its essence
 Edit: I'd also love to know more about the depth of the words that had been used. So in case there is something special about the vocabulary, grammar and so on, I would absolutely appreciate some explanations. I'm ready for a vietnamese "lesson" :)))))

 I am 21F from the US and planning my first trip abroad and intend on it being to Vietnam. In school I learned a lot about Vietnamese history which caused me to want Vietnam or China as my first location and I settled on Vietnam. 
 Because it’s my first trip I want to be able to spend without much worry shopping and food wise. And be in a semi nice/clean hotel. I also intend to hire a Vietnam local to help with navigation, translation, etc. so a few questions. 
 How much should I budget for hotel? Any suggestions?
 How much should I budget for shopping?
 How much should I budget for bribes/transportation?
 I plan to travel to a popular city and more “normal” aka less touristy city if you have any suggestions. 
 I also plan on paying my guide/new friend around 7 mil vnd each week (plan to stay for 1-3) and I’m not sure if this is sufficient based on the current economy, I would pay for all food, transportation, etc while they are with me. 
 Any other travel suggestions as an early 20s female traveling alone in Vietnam is welcome and thank you in advance.

 tui đang cần tìm các từ đồng nghĩa hoặc cách nói khác của “(không) quan tâm”. ko phải quan tâm theo kiểu chăm sóc mà là quan tâm, để ý những điều người khác nghĩ hoặc nói
 hiện tại tui đang có những từ/cụm từ sau:
 để ý, để tâm, để bụng
 mặc kệ, để ngoài tai, kệ xác, kệ mẹ, kệ bà, kệ mợ, bơ, bơ đi mà sống…
 tui vẫn cần tìm thêm, càng dân dã hoặc càng trẻ trâu thì càng tốt. tui cần tìm nhiều và đa dạng chứ ko cần đúng ngữ cảnh nên có từ nào mí bồ cứ liệt kê hết giùm tui nha
 chỉ có là ko được trộn tiếng Anh nên là mấy cái như đ' care hay đếch care là hong được. với là tui cần tìm cách nói khác của từ (không) quan tâm chứ ko phải câu thoại thể hiện thái độ không quan tâm nên là cũng ko phải kiểu “nhún vai và nói ’tưởng bố mày quan tâm à?’“

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lần đầu viết bài, văn có lủng củng không hay thì mọi người thông cảm giúp mình nhé. Thật lòng không biết bắt đầu câu chuyện thế nào. Mình năm nay 19 tuổi, sống ở Ninh Bình. Đáng ra giờ này mình đang năm 2 đại học, tuy nhiên vì 1 số biến cố mà mình vẫn đang ở nhà nuôi mộng đại học. Và quãng thời gian này mình đang cảm thấy rất tuyệt vọng, mình có những kế hoạch, và mình sợ nó sẽ mãi không thành hiện thực. Để tập trung vào chuyện học hành thì mình đã bỏ hoàn toàn fb, zalo và các bạn của mình thì đang học đại học. Vì thế nên mình không còn ai để nói chuyện cả, và việc không giao tiếp với ai ngoài gia đình thực sự làm mình suy sụp. 1 số lúc thôi, nhưng lúc nó xảy ra mình không biết ứng phó thế nào. Rất căng thẳng, mình cảm thấy bản thân vô dụng, là 1 thằng ăn bám. Suy nghĩ của mình rất rối. Mình cần người để nói chuyện, tâm sự. Tuy nhiên mình lại nghĩ rằng làm thế để làm gì? Cũng không đạt tác dụng gì cả. Làm thế chẳng khác nào thừa nhận rằng bản thân yếu đuối, phụ thuộc vào người khác. Nó đến tự nhiên và cũng rời đi rất tự nhiên. Giờ tự nhiên mình thấy bình thường rồi. Chắc chỉ đơn giản viết ra suy nghĩ của bản thân là đỡ. Sao cần phải nhờ người khác khi tự giải quyết được nhỉ. Good luck brothers. 
 Tuy nhiên ai có cách hay thì cho vào đây nhé, mình sẽ rất biết ơn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been here for a a week now and as a solo traveller, Ive been enjoying the solo experience, I often go to eat alone, do activities alone and drink at bar and all sorts of stuff but I never feel lonely at all no ! 
 Don't get me wrong, there were moments were I want to share moments but it makes me appreciate humanity and people a lot more. 
 A lot of travellers and locals often become surprised at the fact that I just do things independently and tell me things like " I'm too scared to be alone" or " Aren't you scared?" Or " Where's your boyfriend?". 
 Scared of what ? Scared of not being able to be comfortable in my own skin? I'd be more afraid of that tbh! 
 The reason why I never feel truly alone or lonely is being I'm at a state of being where I feel content in the present moment, I want to soak it all up and enjoy the time I have here, I talk to people if I want to connect but I also have this freedom to also experience my inner world with the world outside of me and for the time I have here I want to be able to experience that.
 So for another question, what do the introverts or freespirits do here as well in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, just came back from a 2 week trip in VN and it was amazing. I had a few questions lingering from the trip on my mind, which I wanted to just hear discussion on.
 1) As title states, why is PQ so empty? It reminds me of a nicer Cancun/Cabo and the people are amazing. For some reason there was ZERO people at Grand World when we visited during the day and then it wasn't even that busy at night either. The shops seemed fake but they actually had workers when we went in so I'm still confused.
 2) Is tourism down in VN in general this year? Why is that? A lot of the Grab drivers were letting us hire them for the full day and we would just have to pay the Grab rates(or less) and they didn't charge at all for waiting time... (for example if we went to Grand World for 5-6 hours, he would just charge us for the ride there and back)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 My family and I are planning to visit Phu Quoc for a few days and I'm looking for the best transportation option.
 The problem is that motorbikes are not an option for 3 out of 4 of us for various reasons (older age, bad eyesight, and no driver's license). From what I've gathered, grab/other taxi services aren't that common around the island, and renting a car is impossible. But we'd still like to explore and move around and I'm getting a bit discouraged by the research I've done so far.
 Is there an option I haven't considered yet? Or, maybe my research is wrong? What would be the best transport option for the 4 of us around the island?

 Recently left Vietnam after back packing through it for 90 days; missing it already. In my last few days in Hanoi before flying out I redownloaded Pokemon Go just to see what's up, and on my last day there I caught a Beldum with perfect IVs.
 Now, I learned a little Vietnamese (mostly so I could order food in a restaurant from a Vietnamese menu) but I don't exactly have a wide vocabulary. I wanted to nickname that Beldum something Vietnamese and was wondering, for any pokemon fans here, if you have any good ideas for what you might nickname a Metagross.
 Otherwise I'm gonna be stuck calling the thing "Bánh mì", and it deserves better.

I take Remeron and Doxepin and going off those for any length of time is not an option. Are there any exceptions to this rule?

I called our hotel in Hanoi and asked if we could courier our luggage to their hotel for 9 days and they said no. Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our son recently became friends with a Vietnamese boy in his class. We love him and his family, but his parents do not speak English (despite having lived in the US for several years). 
 Last week, our son had a birthday party and as a gift, they gave him a credit/debit card worth $100. We were flabbergasted. They do not seem like an overtly wealthy family: middle class house, etc. 
 We don't know what to do. We are uncomfortable with this gift, but unable to discuss it with them. Of course we would be very tactful if we could, just explaining that it is not the norm in this culture to give such an exorbitant gift. Since they do not speak English after living here for years, we thought perhaps they work in fields where they don't need to, and are thus sort of encapsulated in a cultural bubble? 
 Thoughts on this, and how we should approach it? 
 (Also: when they came to drop off/pick up their son from our house, they refused to come inside. Not even into the entryway. And it was cold outside, so I was standing there with the door open while we waited for the kids to come downstairs. I invited them several times. The only thing I can remotely think of is that we have cats, and maybe they're allergic?)

We were originally thinking 2 years would be the max, and then extend if we like it or move on if we didn’t. The job offer that was received was 3 years. The pay and benefits are good, but he wouldn’t get 2 days off in a row which puts a damper on traveling to other cities to explore. Just wondering what others thoughts are on living in HCMC for an extra year. Would you? Why or why not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never had real Vietnamese food before, but I found a small restaurant in my neighborhood recently and now it has become my favorite! I usually don't eat soups because I find them boring, like the classic veggie or chicken soup that almost everyone makes, or tomato soup, potato soup and so on. They're ok, kinda bland sometimes, but nothing special to me. 
 But the first time I tried Pho Bo, it just blew me away, the combination of flavors is just spectacular. Now whenever I go to this restaurant, I always start with a Pho Bo. Then I continue with other stuff like Bahn Mi, Bún chả and others that I forgot their name and struggle to pronounce them, but I'm trying to learn. I think it's good to learn their real names, it's a sign of respect and appreciation. 
 I also like that they're playing traditional Vietnamese music on speakers, I find it very relaxing. And the people there are also very friendly and hospitable, which makes the whole experience so much better.
 A huge thank you for all the food you bring to the world!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in Vietnam for a month now. Before, I had the impression that it isn't really an expensive country.
 I checked per capita income, it isn't much. 
 But everyone here has some expensive things that just don't make sense. 
 Everyone seems to have iPhone, that too - pro models. Many people here drive expensive cars. Even the grab cabs are relatively good cars.
 But accomodation, hotel stays aren't expensive. Food is fair priced.
 So it just doesn't make sense to me. - how much people earn here, on an average? - if people aren't earning much, how are they able to afford such expensive things? - what is normal mentality people have regarding finances and savings. Do they spend all they earn? - what is mentality on owning things? Why does everything have extensive phones and cars here?

 Not that it matters so much, but I’ve lived in Vietnam the past 20 years, can speak the language, etc. I’m not asking for an appeal to authority, but I have, in my view, earned the right to judge. 
 In terms of the most important parts of culture, Vietnam is a toxic mess that needs to grow up and figure itself out. Now let me qualify that. 
 When you get to know Vietnamese people, they are great. Some of my best friends are Vietnamese. People I would trust with my kids. They’re kind, gentle, caring, and generous. But this is a one-on-one thing. 
 Then there’s the public culture. When the cloak of anonymity drops and no one knows you, people are often vile and selfish. The noise, the littering, the way people drive, elevators, queui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve read a couple of posts/ comments on this sub about experiences of black people in Vietnam. One said that in Vietnam black people are thought to be, aggressive or dirty or unlucky and should expect racism, and not be treated like other tourists, i.e. in a welcoming way. I realise no country is free of racism (some are worse than others) but is it likely to be so apparent that it negatively impacts my experience of Vietnam? If so I would like some insight so I know what to expect.
 I’ve travelled to a handful countries in SE Asia most have friendly locals and I didn’t feel any different to any other travellers. Except in two-ish cases. One country was memorable for people handing me babies to take photos and basically being in a zoo like situation and in another I experienced constant racism, being called a ghost people whispering behind your back, not being served like other people in restaurants etc. The only place I was treated well in that country, was the hotel I stayed at. I plan on going back to the first country because as tiring as that became, after the novelty of being an instant celebrity wore off, the people were not inherently racist just not exposed and they were actually lovely people. The second I will avoid for as long as I can.
 I plan on making the most of this trip either way because I like to experience new places but some insight would be helpful so I can be mentally prepared. It’s a short trip so I’ll only be going to HCMC and Nha Trang. Apart from a few trips to areas near these places, I won’t be venturing anywhere else.

Then they continue to get to know you and follow up advertising about teaching you crypto and are super pushy about it. I am always suspicious the moment they talk to me but let it play out. I never let it get past that part and just tell them to fuck off. However, I am curious where are they going with those scam? They waste so much time and energy and some of them straight up forget their humanity for the sake of trying to get some easy bucks. They also always pretend to be from Cali but I suspect they are from our homeland because I can’t imagine living in the US and using these dirty tactics to make a living. It is so shameful and embarrassing.

 I'm afraid of scammers that will ask for more money even if booking.com says it's free for me.

I have been to Thailand before but since my wife wanted the feel of it, I have included a week. Need suggestions if thats a good idea. Vietnam itinerary- Land in Hanoi on 12th Jan. 3 nights Hanoi/Ha Long and nearby 1 night in train/bus to Da Nang 2 nights in Da Nang 1 night in Hoi An or vice versa 1 night in train/bus to HCMC 2 nights in HCMC
 On 22nd Jan, flight from HCMC to Chiang Mai.
 2nights in Chiang Mai 1 night travel to BKK BKK to Phuket flight 2 nights in Phuket/Krabi Phuket to BKK flight 2 nights in BKK/Pattaya On 29th Jan, Monday, back to India.
 Thailand itinerary is not finalised yet just a rough thought on the above as on my previous trip I have already covered BKK, Pattaya, Phuket, Koh Samui and the full moon party. This trip was before Thailand legalised weed. I am also considering Thailand this time as both of us want to experience the weed culture now along with the new places like Chiang Mai, Krabi etc. Currently i have only booked the departure to Hanoi on 12th Jan, planning to book HCMC- Chiang Mai and BKK to delhi back, by tomorrow. Please help guide if I am doing the right thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I opened a Vietnamese cafe in Philadelphia United States. We sell grilled pork skewers, beef skewers, shrimp skewers, fried rice, shrimp fried rice, seafood fried rice, chicken wings, fish wings, garlic wings, spring rolls. Many of the Vietnamese restaurants here sell phở, mì quảng, bún bò huế and soups. We want to sell food the other restaurants don’t sell. What are some ideas or recipes we can offer that will sell well and be popular? We have a small kitchen space so it’s difficult to offer a lot of different options at the same time. 
 Tôi mở một quán cà phê Việt Nam ở Philadelphia Hoa Kỳ. Chúng tôi bán xiên que nướng, xiên bò, xiên tôm, cơm chiên, cơm chiên tôm, cơm chiên hải sản, cánh gà, cánh cá, cánh tỏi, chả giò. Nhiều nhà hàng Việt Nam ở đây bán phở, mì quảng, bún bò huế và các món súp. Chúng tôi muốn bán đồ ăn mà các nhà hàng khác không bán. Một số ý tưởng hoặc công thức nấu ăn nào chúng tôi có thể đưa ra sẽ bán chạy và được ưa chuộng? Chúng tôi có không gian bếp nhỏ nên khó có thể đưa ra nhiều lựa chọn khác nhau cùng lúc.

Our sim cards were simultaneously deactivated after 36 hours. We went to the official Viettel store in Hoi An, and she looked up the sim cards. She said that they were very old and that they were not registered on their network anymore. She also told us to only buy from an official Viettel store, and said that there are no official Viettel stores at Da Nang airport. We had to buy new sim cards (we paid 170k for 2 gigs a day for a month - less than the 240k we paid at the airport). Thankfully we paid with a credit card so we can dispute the charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Husband and I have just finished visiting the northern region of Vietnam, mainly Hanoi, Cat Ba and Ninh Binh. We are just blown away by this beautiful country and it’s people.
 There’s just so much to see and do in this beautiful country. Only being here for a few days we were so sad to leave but have so much appreciation for the hustle and bustle life of busy cities like Hanoi, as well as the calm and quiet lifestyle of those in Cat Ba.
 The variety of food options available here makes me so embarrassed as a westerner who had only heard about Pho. My favourite meal was when I had a local home cooked meal prepared by the wife of the caption who was taking us on a tour on Ha long bay. 
 Lastly, the people. I have never met such wonderful, accommodating and most admirably hard working individuals in any other place in the world. Some people on this sub say that people nag tourists to buy stuff, but I see that as them working hard to earn their keep. I just feel so much respect and admiration and ashamed at the times I have felt lazy to do my privileged job. 
 So grateful to have had this travelling experience in this beautiful country and can’t wait to be back.

 The ones they try to sell / force onto me are always so old and stale, but I have a feeling that I'd really like the fresh ones, if I could find any. 
 Anyone know where they come from? Thanks! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just spent my evening at bui vien and absolutely heart breaking to see so many young children being sent out to sell items/blowing fire/begging. Being dragged around by parent or young siblings absolutely tired unable to keep eyes open. We even saw an infant no older that a month old being taken around the loud clubs with her begging mother. WHY is there not a ban in place for children to be on this PARTY street late in the evening?? Why are the vietnam govt allowing these children to be used in this way. I don’t know how people can enjoy there evening seeing the sad reality for these children. My heart breaks for them all.
 EDIT 
 i believe some people have taken this post in the wrong way. What I am wondering is if these children are being used by gangs etc why does the gov not try and minimise children being used in this way in main tourist areas etc

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not sure my English is correct. How much should women often “challenge” their Vietnamese partners for wedding?
 Introduction of myself: I am Chinese girl living in Hanoi. My sister and brother-in-law moved their factory here in 2018. I saw them having a good life here . They can afford having kids which is nightmare in China nowadays. So I decided to move and work here. I’m 24 years old, and it’s time to think about serious traditional relationship. My brother in law introduced me his Vietnamese customer. He’s a great and humorous guy. He’s running 3 clothes stores and online shops. We’re having good relationship and I think about marriage. In China, women’s families often expect wedding presents as cash from men. In my home province in China, it’s often 100000 cny (340 million vnd). I don’t expect the same amount in Vietnam. May be our tradition can be different. I’m curious how much I should expect from my future Vietnamese husband.
 I’m ready for marriage life here. My personal finance is good. And I improved my Vietnamese a lot. I can sing See Tinh well 😁. It’s very easy for Chinese to pronounce Vietnamese words.

 I've been working as an English teacher in Vietnam for the past (almost) 2 months.
 My boss showed me a contract at the beginning but I never actually signed anything. I am trying to look for new work because she 'fired' me like a month ago?? But I've still been working for her??
 Basically, she told me at first that the company can't keep me because they can't afford teachers and I'm not good enough. But then she said I could stay at the accommodation while I find new work.
 Then when a new company showed interest, she told me I can't change over because I'll get the company in trouble? She explained that she has to cancel my visa first. The agent says I need a letter from my bo…]]></summary>

 Twice today, once in a beautifully quiet pho restaurant, sat down, then suddenly a huge coach outside and in they flocked accompanied with a shouting tour guide armed with a flag, table barged into, bag on the floor knocked over, coughing whilst walking past no hand over mouth, loud noise for the next miserable 20 minutes. Then later on the beach, all calm, and along come a huge flock of about 40 of them, walking literally right next to me even though there's so much space, yelling at each other. Wtf is going on?! Lol. Can Chinese people travel alone or in couples or is it a government rule by the ccp that they must travel in large flocks of minimum 50 and cause maximum impact wherever they go... Just curious.... Don't see any other nationalities travelling like this....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just came from Tokyo where I would sing karaoke and have a great time. It was fun. It was lovely. People bonding over music and enjoy life in karaoke bars/rooms in noisy areas like Kabukicho, far from residental areas.
 Just came back to Vietnam, a country that is the complete opposite of Japan in every way imaginable and I swear it sounds like someone is running a duck over with a lawnmower every time they pick up a microphone. I'm no Freddie Mercury by any means, but it has to be something in the water here making people tone-deaf.
 I just got to my girlfriend's house, she has been really sick for a week, and despite knowing that the neighbors have been playing karaoke nonstop. Extremely selfish? Yes. But, I'm currently listening to what sounds like a roadkill dying and I want to stab my eardrums out with chopsticks.
 How is this legal? In every other place I've ever lived, the police would shut this tragedy of a performance down asap. Is it the way the language sounds or are people supposed to sound like they're drowning when they sing? Can we get a petition going to forever ban karaoke machines within a 4km radius of any city?

 It feels uncomfortable to me and it looks unprofessional, but I've never complained about it. Should I neck massage my subordinates to fit in with the culture? lol I wonder how wives feel about this.

 My dad is currently very sick with terminal cancer and lives with me in Canada outside of Vietnam. He has a Sacombank bank account with a decent amount of money in it, but it’s “locked in” as it was an interest generating account. 
 Due to his illness, he will not be able to travel back to Vietnam to do any banking as he’s very sick. Is there anything we can do to unlock the account so he can move funds to our country (Canada)? He’s under the belief the banks need him physically there but he’s in nope shape to travel.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I am travelling to Vietnam for 5 days in the last week of January. We are group of 3/4 people and have short listed Ninh Binh and Hanoi as places to visit. We are landing in Hanoi, that’s why. Haven’t booked the tickets yet. 
 So, do you all think it’s wise to cover these two places in 5 days? We want to stay for at least 2 days in Ninh Binh as well not just one day tour there. 
 Would really appreciate your guidance on what places we should must go considering the short span of time in both cities. 
 Is it a wise decision to cover both places or should we stick to one place only? 
 Thanks for you help and suggestions in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I expected people to do research to know what to expect and today alone theres 2 posts about scam taxis in TSN. I get it, its a mess of an airport. Sometimes its a maze just to navigate so ill try to make it easier. I assume u have downloaded grab before the trip to SEA, and u can pay in cash.
 If u dont have any data, it is possible to ask your hotel to arrange transportation. Usually higher end places can do this. Somebody will hold a sign with your name at the arrival gate. Airport wifi kinda wacky sometimes
 If u arrive from international airport, once ur out of the airport, go across the street to the parking lot. There are prearranged Grab vehicles spots where they can pick u up. Book them and head there asap
 If u arrive from domestic, its a lil annoying but doable. Leave the domestic terminal and head to the building across, this is the parking building.
 parking building
 Head straight pass all the shophouses and little kiosks to the parking lot looking area
 ​
 Grab pick up area
 Grab's designated pickup area is on lane D1, from pillar a5 to l5. Book em and wait for em here.
 Do:
 - Turn on location on grab so the grab driver know where u are
 - Ignore all the trip or taxi sellers on the way
 - Keep an eye on exact pickup location. Grab gives u a range of pillar (ie d5 to j5). Stay at the right place so the driver can pick u up on time. They only have about 3 minutes
 - Check if its the right plate number, cant even tell u how many people forgot bout this
 DONT:
 - Take any taxis other than Vinasun or Mai Linh. Even for these 2 brands they tend to send "VIP" taxis that charge u at higher rate
 - Spend time listen to anyone dissuate u from taking ur booked ride for "cheaper". Tell em u had a ride and move pass em
 - Let ANYONE even touch ur wallet. Like tf??
 Airports are hotspots for scams, its like this for any country. Its the same shit outside of Charles de Gaulle or Beijing. Stay vigilant and enjoy ur trip

 The dog seemed alright, I think it was just being playful and saying hello in an untrained way but my gf is pretty worried that theres a chance she's going to get rabies and die. We've had the course of rabies injections before coming to Vietnam but it's my understanding that this doesn't give you full protection and the ability to ignore dog bites.
 We left the restaurant before being able to ask if the guys dog normally does this
 What do you guys think?
 We've just called the dog owner and he said the the dog has had a rabies vaccine
 Edit: Have gone to the hospital to have shots

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[List of things I hate when visiting Vietnam after 20+ years
  
Bribed at the airport (Was told I brought too many bottles of medicine and was asked to give them $30 or have all the medicine confiscated)
 
Elderly cutting people in line whenever they see an opportunity and just people cutting in general
 
Pushing and shoving when waiting in line and no idea of people’s boundaries.
 
Fake pricing and trying to rip off people in general (rampant across Vietnam and in almost all market except the mall)
 
Trash everywhere
 
Lack of Public Utilities
 
Traffic is so chaotic and unsafe (Witness a deadly accident and a death of a motorcyclist in the three weeks that I’ve visited here)

 The first step stepping out of ho chi minh, the best economic city of vietnam, of its airport, the whole country's image is severely damaged. Totally no police patrolling and ensuring any passengers safety.
 I believe there are alot of good people in vietnam too, but the lack of law and safety is really bad, allowing scammer to roam freely.

 I am from China and watched it last week in Australia. Generally I enjoyed the show. The choreography, stage design, acting are all fantastic. There were some really impressive scenes to look at which are more powerful than a modern action movie could do. 
 The downside is that I did feel the extent of stereotype on Vietnamese/Communist characters is a bit glaring. I can understand it was written by French men during the cold war so we shouldn't be too harsh. I'm wondering how everyone here thinks about it.

I left a credit card active, hoping they don’t use it when they try the others. So I can at least use my phone with ereaders.
 I have until the 29th before me evisa expires. I’m going to the embassy tomorrow. How much does a new passport cost? Can it be paid for with a credit card on an ereader? Banks are Wellsfargo and Chase. How quickly can banks usually get out a new card? I used my card on Grab to order a few meals and some water. I have 20,000 in dong.
 A total headache, my god. 😆 Any informed advice would be most appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[been in hanoi 7 days now, super surprised about how eager everyone seems to be to put tourists on motorbikes. feels like there’s a conspiracy to keep the hanoibus lines secret. they’re cheap and about as reliable as your average US urban bus. why aren’t they more often suggested? is it because Vietnamese people don’t want to share their public transport with tourists/foreigners? yes they’re slow, yes you detour, maybe these are good things that some tourists might actually want?
 anyway. after some stumbling about i finally figured out that if you put “xe <province name>” into google it’s pretty easy to find the regional bus routes, too, which i assume (perhaps foolishly?) won’t be much worse. 
 but here’s the thing. i sorta want to relive some version of my experience from 20 years ago on Java riding the indonesian version of “Xe khách dù” using only speaking knowledge of numbers, and before google. the only guide i found suggested they’d be impossible for foreigners to navigate, which seems ??? . uncomfortable, sure. absolutely no equivalent to anything “back home” in europe - 100%, correct. but “impossible?” really?
 we’re trying a regional bus tomorrow to one of the “craft villages” that all the guides say you should hire a taxi to get to (??). if that works then i think i would like to give a “Xe khách dù” a shot. 
 is this a terrible idea? will my presence on one will cause more upset or offence than curiosity or humour (including humour at my expense, “look at the stupid foreigner” kinda thing)?

 Obviously because he's on holidays I don't want to ruin his fun but at the same time I don't want to contribute to the problem (both morally and money wise) but I'm curious as to whether alcoholism is seen as a 'problem' in Vietnam? 
 I know the males in vietnam are very keen on nhau but I'm not sure if social attitudes see it as a problem. My wife is Fiji-Indian and she says in their culture its completely normal to have 5-6 beers a day, but this doesn't mean it isn't a problem. 
 Just wanted a different perspective to see how I can address this issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi y'all. 
 the weather in saigon is extremely humid and muggy, especially in the morning, hence i tend to wear shorts (gym shorts and short jeans) whenever going out. but i have noticed there are places/situations that wearing shorts might be inappropriate. so far, the situations i have been through myself include visiting temples, going to government offices, and attending a funeral. are there any other places that i should pay more attention? i am male btw. 
 thanks every in advance for enlightening me!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm heading to Danang this December and hoping to try paragliding while I'm there. Can anyone suggest the best spots for paragliding that won't break the bank? The prices I've seen online are crazy – nearly $100 for one person! I'm sure the locals might have some better insights. It's more expensive than the 5-star hotel I'm staying at, which is pretty amusing! 😄
 Also, besides paragliding, I'd love recommendations for other fun activities in the area. Any local favorites or must-do experiences? Thanks a bunch!
 Edited: Moreover, Is this national park worth going with a tour guide or DIY should be fine? https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/11139-trekking-bach-ma-national-park-day-tour-hue/

 Firstly - it was absolutely magical: breathtaking views, wonderful local homestays, friendly locals & smiling children, and great food.
 Secondly: we were told it can't be done. We have no international driver's license. We were told nobody would rent to Americans. We were told laws were strict due to recent accidents and not to bother unless we did it via a group.
 For us - this all proved to be wrong. And because of these misperceptions - we didn't encounter a single American on our route (plenty of French/Chinese/Japanese/British/Australian/German people, though).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading a book recently that claimed Pol Pot planned to invade South Vietnam, and essentially try to take Saigon before the North Vietnamese forces arrived and restore the Mekong to Cambodia, which nationalists there historically claim. It didn't happen because of how unexpectedly quickly the RVN forces fell to the North, although Cambodian forces did briefly take Phu Quoc after the fall of Saigon before being expelled. And then ultimately crushed in 1978 when the battle-hardened Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia. 
 It got me thinking about what would have happened if he had invaded the much weaker South Vietnam, assuming it hadn't collapsed so quickly. Could he have pushed through to Saigon? Would China, who preferred to have Vietnam divided, have provided more support? Any good sources or alternate history places to read more?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story: my mom (Viet Kieu with no Vietnamese CCCD) gave my grandmother money to buy land and a house. So we spent monies on buying that land and built a house. 
 My grandmother died, then transferred that land title to my Aunt. Now that my mom retired to Vietnam, she has CCCD and Ho Khau. 
 We asked Aunt say to transfer land back to my mom's name, she refused. She gave a lame excuse like "Oh, when I die, I will put you on the will paper, transferring the land to you. Don't worry nobody will live in your house". (She has the red book, it means she could easily sell the land and house right?) 
 My aunt is a 60 year old, childless, never married woman.
 I have a video recording of the aunt admitting that my grandma gifting the land to my mom, and the whole village (it's small) knows that we bought the land and house 15 years ago. I have many aunts and uncles and nighebours that can be the witness, if that means anything in court.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just took a trip to Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. One thing I noticed, particularly in shops, cafes and restaurants is that while in the other countries (even hyper expensive Singapore), buildings were usually an arctic blast the moment you walk in, a lot of places in Vietnam often only have 1 AC unit running, AC set to a high temperature or areas of the premises partitioned off for "cleaning".
 I also noticed they usually just open the windows in the morning in spite of the noise, heat and pollution, waiting till the heat was unbearable before finally shutting the windows and turning the AC on and would sometimes turn off the AC 30 minutes or more before closing time. Is it really that expensive to run AC in Vietnam? . . Disclaimer - before the "all police" chime in, obviously not all Vietnamese businesses are like this and I'm sure they do this in other countries too but that besides the point.

I have this job offer at a kindergarten which should keep me busy during the day for the most part, so I basically have the evenings and the weekend for myself. Is there much to do there? How long does it take to get to HCMC if I want to spend the weekend there, I am also big into swimming, are there any swimming pools that you can subscribe to? Food options etc. I applied your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! When my Uncle served for the US Army in Vietman, he was stationed in Nha Trang. His experience was far different than so many other veterans - he had a pretty good life while he was there and has been back to visit, in fact. He managed to get into a relationship with a local woman named Diep (out of respect I am not posting her full name) which he still reminisces of fondly to this day. He yearns to know that she is okay.
 Pics: https://imgur.com/shBetbb https://imgur.com/QinNwTP 
 This is a shot in the dark but I wanted to at least let my Uncle know that I shared his story. I also realize that she and many others may have had a completely different perspective of things. Apologies ahead of time but this is about their relationship, nothing else. He is getting very old and this is one of the last things that he's never gotten closure on. If you know or knew this woman, enjoy the pictures. If you wish to share anything about her, please do. I'll share them with him.
 Thank you. Be well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, lying contemplatively, I suddenly sat and pondered about charity. I looked at it from a different perspective.
 If there were no charity missions, would the children there not know about the existence of better food, nicer clothes? Most people know that charity is often organized with groups going to remote areas for a few days, cooking, providing clothes, books, and supplies, and then everyone goes back home.
 The children/people in those areas get to eat 'okay' for a few meals, and then it goes back to reality as usual. So, does charity bring any meaning to the people there? Or is it a way for the children to see themselves as 'poor' compared to society? So, if there were no charity, or if they didn't go on social media to see others 'flexing', would their lives be less self-conscious?

However, there's no actual flight ticket anywhere to be found! The Vietjet website FAQ section seems to imply a second email with the tickets should've been sent out with the booking confirmation but I've never received this. If I use my booking number on the Vietjet website to retrieve my booking details it only shows me my flight itinerary, no ticket.
 Has anyone had this experience with Vietjet before? I know it's a budget airline and it's got it's money saving ways (read: scummery) but I'd still love to hear any advice.

 I adjusted my travels to not end up in Huế when the floodwaters were up high, but some people have told me it’s now subsided.
 Can anyone in Huế give an update on the flooding today? Is the citadel area, northwest of the river, now dry? And are restaurants and markets operating normally?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào, 
 I come with a question and hope to get an answer because this is impacting my study. 
 While learning I notice some sayings would use “do la” vs “nay”. How do I differentiate when to use them? 
 Example: do la mot chiec vậy đẹp. that is a beautiful skirt. 
 Quyền sach nay đặt tiền. This book is expensive. 
 Ban co thích cứ a hang nay khong? Do you like this store? 
 So basically I’m asking when is it nay and do la. Is this just something to remember or is there a grammar vocabulary thing I should work on to help transition my learning. 
 Cảm ơn VN and Reddit ❤️

 But aside from my excitement, the beggining of March is also the start of Ramadan, holy month for us Muslims. Since I'll be fasting and all, I would like to know how Muslims are perceived by the rest of the Vietnamese population. I saw that there are a lot of mosques, but maybe people don't perceived it very well you know? So I rlly want to know from you guys! Thanks a lot!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone
 My friend and me were remniscing and joking today about our Vietnam trip that we made almost 10 years ago.
 During the discussion we came upon the subject of hearing those generic beats and basslines of those Vinahouse tracks being played loud af in random shops in Southern Vietnam.
 You know, these famous "DUN - DUH DUH DUH - DUN" beats. 😂
 And during the discussion, we asked ourselves if there is an actual original song or remix that started it all.
 In that article here...
 https://danangleisure.com/vinahouse-in-a-nutshell-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-it
 ... there is the mention of a remix of a song called “Tình phai” by DJ Hoàng Trọc and DJ Alan Tian, that apparently initiated the birth of the genre.
 I searched for that particular remix here and there, but I couldn't find anything.
 Does anyone know a hint or could point us to a specific song or remix? I am aware that Vinahouse songs are pretty much always just a silly remix of some other song, but there HAS TO BE ONE specific remix or track that started it all??
 I think of something like in that particular video here:
 https://youtu.be/_Zd46k_Z02M?si=5KbNSOsTXf-2l7oH
 Thanks to all you legends!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we're planning of travelling to Hanoi in December and doing an excursion to Hạ Long Bay area. We can plan to either do a 2 day 1 night cruise but typically these finish at midday and then travel back to Hanoi. Does anyone have any recommendations for trips that are 2 day 1 night but only travel back to Hanoi around 4/5 pm so make the most of the 2nd day? We are unable to do a 3 day 2 night trip as our flight is very early on the 3rd day.
 Alternatively does anyone know what cruises we can do that drop off at Cat Ba island on the 2nd day and we do our own thing before heading back to Hanoi? I believe the last boat/bus back is at 4pm, but please tell me if there are other later options for returning to Hanoi.
 Any any recommendations on if to do Lan Ha Bay/Cat ba island instead of Hạ Long Bay?

 ![img](i6pmivydq31c1 " ")
 Mới vụ gần đây có một tiktoker bị bóc phốt vì nói lớ tiếng việt. Căn bản là bạn này sinh ra ở Việt Nam nhưng sống ở Mỹ cũng được nhiều năm. Mới gần đây, bạn ấy có đăng một vài video trong đó bạn nói tiếng Việt có bị chậm. Không biết là ai ném đá trước nhưng sau một thời gian thì có nhiều Tiktoker khác bu vào chửi bới và khinh bỉ rằng OOP giả bộ không biết Tiếng Việt để tỏ vẻ Mỹ Trắng.
 Lúc đầu thì mình cũng ngỡ ngàng tại vì mình sống nước ngoài cũng khá lâu. Mình chưa bao giờ tiếp xúc với người Việt gốc nào giả bộ nói lớ tiếng Việt để “làm màu”. Những comments mình đọc được thì cũng nhiều thành phần nói thẳng ra là vô cùng vô văn hoá và thiếu suy nghĩ. Bao nhiêu người, già hay trẻ, xô vào để cấu xé cô gái có 22-24 tuổi làm vài video giải trí trên mạng. Rồi nhiều Tiktoker còn tự chế thông tin kêu là bạn này mới qua được một năm, bạn này bắt chước hoa hậu nào đó cũng bị lớ giọng sau khi học nhiều thứ tiếng. Thật sự là mình hơi ngạc nhiên khi thấy tình trạng bóc phốt bây giờ nhỏ nhặt đến mức chỉ nói lớ tiếng Việt là ăn chửi. Liệu Tiktok VN bây giờ có thô thiển quá mà chỉ toàn “The Drama”, kiếm nạn nhân để mà chửi câu view hay không?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a white guy travelling slowly by train and stopped in a small station called Bong Son 80km north of Quy Nhon then went 15km north with a taxi. There's obviously very little tourism there especially westerners so at least 1/3 of people say hello or ask questions, kids come running to me etc but mostly positive encounters.
 Of course some laugh at me because I'm a 185cm dude on some tiny multicolor bicycle I got from my hotel roaming the dirt roads but I don't mind.
 But today I was cycling at this spot https://maps.app.goo.gl/WJqaow9SXyUgEGic9 and a young guy around 16yo on a scooter stopped me in the middle of the road and was quite angry for some reason. Couldn't speak a word of english and I can't speak vietnamese. He left after maybe 2 minutes so I kept going the same way (down south to get to a creek) and he turned back, turned again and was behind me and gave me a kick with his foot in the back of my bicycle.
 I realised he certainly didn't want me to go that way for some reason so I turned back and I didn't see him again.
 Any idea what happened there ? It's not like there were house nearby or I was in a private property.

It's so incredibly different, for context, I'm Vietnamese Australian and being here made me fall in love with the life here, although maybe that's idealistic but living in a western society for so long made me realise how deeply problematic the social system and dynamic are, it might work for some and it might not work for others but I love it here, btw this is my first solo trip and well... So far here's my experience, the ho Chi Minh song from vietjetair is stuck in my head, I feel a deep sense of pride for him even though I wasn't born here,I oddly comfortable here, I ate Banh mi Huynh hoa, I spoke to the locals, I got scammed but hey it's all experienced so I'm not mad, just a little disappointed but hey it's life. People are helpful, willing to help.
 So I guess this probably a very adventurous start, and a big welcome to Vietnam. Wow, that's day 1 anyway till I post again, next flight Hanoi !
 If there is anything fun to do and awesome food/drink to try, please let me know !

 My concerns are:
  
air quality
 are there bike paths along those rivers where I can exercise
 can I rent a decent size apartment (over 40 sq. meters) within walking distance for under 1000 USD (prefer a bit lower).
  
I have never been to Vietnam but have only heard good things about living and working there.

Arriving in Hue on 21st and leaving Da Nang for Ho Chi Minh on 29th but because the current flooding in Hue we were wondering whether to completely skip central Vietnam and just go to the south. Do you think it's ok to go there still or should we miss it?
 My main concern is the flooding but also will it be mainly raining whilst we're there too? 
 Are Hoi an and da Nang impacted by the floods? And is transport still possible?
 In which case thinking of spending more time in the south.
 Recommendations from people locally are really appreciated or have been before!

We enjoy nature and calm but also maybe a place with a couple bars where we can meet people and also some nice cultural events. We were thinking somewhere north and we are not sure if we are going to stay very long in the south because of the hot weather. ( We like the cold!) Eventhough our flight back home will be leaving from Ho Chi Minh City. We are in Hanoï right now and we are craving for a place much less busy and quieter (we have been in cities for the past 3 weeks). It can also be in center Vietnam, we were thinking of being there at the end of December / beginning of January. Thank you for you advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I am a 27M from Western Europe but living in Korea since 2 years.
 I was recently contacted by a Korean giant company to work in Vietnam on a more leadership role than what I do now.
 Everything seems great for now however when going across the recruiter's profile I could see that they offered 30M/month on this job.
 As I don't know anything about Vietnam or their currencies, I checked the change and I was surprised to see that it was not even meeting the mininmum wage in my home country.
 I understand that economy and buying power may be different in Vietnam, however I am bound to travel a lot (Home country, Korea, SEA...).
 Because it seems so low, I was wondering if it was a scam or a possible mistake, or if it is a normal and decent salary in Vietnam.
 Edit : The job would be in Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu
 Edit 2 : I got a lot of answers, thank you for your reactivity !
 As far as I know, this is not a scam - I got contacted on LinkedIn and everything is linked to this worldwide korean company, including the job listing.
 As a LinkedIn expert myself having done a lot of recruitment, you can't usurpate identity and pretend to be from another company while posting a job.
 I didn't receive details about the salary yet. I just found the 30M information on the recruiter's profile.
 Thanks to you, from my understanding it may be great for a local but not for an expat. Let's hope their package is evolving if they want to hire an expat, or let's pray that they forgot a number !
 Thank you

 Just finished a 7 days motorcycle tour in Ha Giang that started and ended in Hanoi.
 I've never seen a more scary place than Hanoi and surrounding area from a pollution, crowded and garbage perspective.
 The 70 km from Thai Nguyen to Hanoi I felt like I'm riding through the end of the world. 
 You cannot see the sky and buildings afar from pollution, over industrialization that pollutes every living thing, garbage everywhere.
 In the city sitting in traffic between a mass of cars, trucks emitting black smoke and scooters I felt like I'm going to pass out.
 Absolute hellish experience. Probably my first and last time in that city.

 I am an amateur photographer (website here for reference) and am very interested in photographing the fishing villages around Da Nang and Hoi An--more particularly Hoi An where I anticipate heading to after landing in Da Nang. I would like to photograph fisherman with their nets out on the water but also people mending/storing nets in the villages. Stylistically, this would be very similar to Réhan's work with fishing villages.
 I am looking for recommendations on where near Hoi An (or Da Nang) people fish. I understand there is some fishing right of Cua Dai beach. Would hiring a boat on the Thu Bon river allow for easier viewing of fisherman?
 Thanks!

 i really did not understand what the vietnam war actually was about til i got older cause through their lense it was mainly „well the communist were shit and evil towards us“ but they did not mention too much the american army. so i grew up thinking „well these communist folks were super bad“ (and „communist“ was used interchangebly with „north vietnamese“). also, grew up pretty western, so the evil communist narrative is kinda norm.
 at some point, a couple of years ago i watched this long documentary series called „vietnam“ by us-american documentary filmmaker ken burns, and for me, it was a very significant turning point cause now all the „evil communist“ had faces, their story, their motive. that being said, of course i knew the narrative of my parents are by no means universal. but you know, that was basically the only story all your life.
 however, i never knew that this war was so incredibly complex, not only since the beginning of the american engagement. for me the documentary doesn‘t seem to biased, on the contrary, it reveals alot of the american misjudgment and bad (and dare to say, evil) decisions. 
 how do you guys perceive the documentary? do people in vietnam know this movie? what effect did it have on you, if you‘ve seen it? genuinely interested in some thoughts

But I recently had to finish a paper and thinking writing about Viet would be probably easy. I ran across the work of Mark Alves, a linguist who basically reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of Vietic language. And I started to realise how Vietnamese really kinda stands on its own as being a SouthEastern and East Asian language. I don’t why but this was my shower thought about why there is so much Chinese built within Vietnamese language.
 I noticed in his work there was a lot of old Chinese (and of course other dialects and Chinese words over history) still used in Vietnamese. I had a weird shower thought that Vietnamese language seems like a sponge for Chinese language, if they didn’t have an existing word for it they just take it from their big neighbours. And I think hearing from my family about colonialism isn’t the whole story why there’s so many words adopted. I’m curious about if anyone knows if there are studies on this.

 I am a so called "Việt kiều" in my early 20s. Born and raised in America. I have been back to Vietnam 4 times since I was 12, with the most recent trip being about a month ago. It was the first time coming back as a grown adult, so I did and saw a lot more. It was the most memorable trip of my life.
 Returning to America, I feel my life is boring. I don't have many friends, and I hate my job. It felt weird to have to return and live in a country that is so quiet and...sterile in comparison. We have a Viet community here in my state, but it pales in comparison to Texas, Cali. I miss Vietnam so much, I am considering getting a 90 day visa and returning before Tết, living off of savings.

 During my last trip to south east Asia I visited Vietnam and, of course, I fell in love with the Country.
 I also really enjoyed Hoi An and its charm, and I had the opportunity to get some tailored suits (of course) and to buy some leather items such as wallets, keychain, etc.
 I bought the leather stuff in a store called Da Bao, which I tried to send some email to see if they can do international shipments. But unfortunately I had no replies. 
 So my question to you guys is, can you recommend a good store who can do it? (of course non strictly from hoi an).
 Cảm ơn!

 Out of several 500,000 VND bills, one of them is slightly torn. I took a picture of the ATM and the ATM number and information on it.
 Have been here before in the past they made a big deal about a slightly torn and 200,000 VND note, and would not take it.
 According to this law site, it states any bank per the law needs to replace a ripped bill, however, and practice does this work? Or should I just tape it and try to use it somewhere? The tear is maybe 4-5mm on the bottom of the note.

For money that is not eligible for circulation as stipulated in Clause 2 Article 4 of this Regulation, the above units shall receive and consider exchanging with the conditions specified in Point a, b Clause 2 Article 6 of this Circular. If the conditions for money exchange are not satisfied, these units shall return the money to customers and give a notice of the reason thereof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I caught the night train down from Hanoi last night. We hit massive flooding just outside Hue (Quang Tri) and stopped at 7am. 
 We haven’t moved since. We can’t get off the train, and we’re not being given any information by the staff, or the tourism company the train service is with. There’s not much food or water, and the staff are hiding from us. 
 I’m starting to get quite worried and stressed. Does anyone know when the floods will recede? Or could we be stuck here on the train until the weekend or longer? We’re scared we will run out of food and water and power soon. We definitely won’t move until morning now. 
 We would get off and try to find a car to take us back north, but it’s dark and too risky, we don’t know the situation out there. 
 Please stay safe everyone in the region!
 Edit: woke up. We’ve still not moved. We’ve been on the train for 36 hours+ now. It’s still raining heavily. My boyfriend is starting to get sick and is coughing with no water. We’re starting to get very sad and scared. We haven’t seen any staff members for 10+ hours. We’re not at a station so can’t get off. We’re on a ‘tourist carriage’ so no Vietnamese to ask for help. We’re ‘safe’ physically from the rain, and I’m grateful for that, but I’m so fed up of not knowing. At this point, we just want to fly back home from what was meant to be our dream trip. I feel so, so guilty for suggesting we take the train 😭 
 Edit 2: staff has abandoned us. We cannot find them. We have had news and no supplies for 12+ hours. Everyone is leaving the train and trying to escape now. We know it’s not safe, but we will also risk leaving now while it’s still light and the rain has stopped for a while. We will try to get to Dong Ha, then go north.

Plus, ever time I hear or see the word Xin Chao, it reminds me of the League of Legends champion.
 Am I the odd one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Vietnamese friend of mine is in big financial difficulties. Stupidly he took loans from illegal lenders - sharks @ 15% interest per month. He paid interest every month but none of the principal amount, so far 90% of the loan value. 
 Considering this kind of lending is illegal, how can he get out of this and negotiate better terms without ending up injured or worse?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title suggest, it is currently flooded and my flight out is tomorrow morning at 10. Should I pack some food now and head on out to the airport now?
 I don't think the waters are going to clear out overnight so I'm better off going now vs struggling tomorrow?
 What do you guys think is the best course of action?
 I probably have to find higher ground then flag down a cab or book a grab to the airport? I'm guessing I can wash up there and wait overnight for my flight.
 I have a friend flying out tonight, she's heading to Saigon. I will just checkout today despite paying till tomorrow. Is there food available at HUI Airport?
 Edit: was trapped in the hotel, the staff had locked up the doors and abandoned us. Absolute bizarre experience but turns out it was tied up.
 Untied and made it to the streets before a boat picked up us. Currently staying at a homestay just a km away from the airport.
 What an experience.

 Ive arrived yesterday in Vietnam (Hanoi) yesterday for the first time. Unfortunately, I learmed when I arrived at the airport that my checked bag has not made it through with me. I was lucky enough to have pack my most expensive item with me (just in case you know...) But now I'm left without clothes and over the counter medications (tynenol, gravol, Imodium, ...).
 I have been trying to find places to buy back some stuff in Hanoi today that are legit and provide receipt. While I was able to get some medications I'm Pharmacity in Hanoi. I've not been able to find legit places to get basic clothes with receipt. I went to a mall that have Amerian brands to try to find something that is not a random store in the street but realized that there is only men's clothes and everything is well overpriced aven comparer with Canada. 
 Do you know a good place to go to shop for essentials, most importantly shoes but also shorts, pants, shirts where they give receipt and prices are ok? My itinerary '/reservation are to go to Cat Ba and Nin Ninh in the next day but I doubt I'll find something there. I'm very lost at this point so I'm ok going back to Hanoi of required.

 I've stayed here for a bunch of years now and I always had a gaming PC with me. Every house/apartment I've lived in, my PC case or peripherals like microphone or any metallic parts will discharge a painful static shock to the part that touches my person. 
 I've checked online to make sure I did everything within my control, things like no carpet under the CPU, new power cables, quality extension plugs and no stray exposed cables touching the case. 
 Wall plugs here doesn't have the 3 hole option so that's telling me something is not grounded hence the shocks. 
 If it helps, my microphone gives out a permanent static white noise with or without my voice activating the microphone, tested by using the "listen to this device function. 
 Questions: 
  
Should I change my PSU? 
 
Should I call the electrician to come and ground my house properly (I recently built a new house)? 
 
Are there any work arounds for those who experienced the same problem? 
 
Gamers with gaming laptops, do you get shocks from your laptops while its charging? (I am seriously considering getting a laptop because of this problem but I am unsure if it makes any difference because of the lack of grounding) 
 
 Any help is greatly appreciated!

 All three of us are happily in a relationship right now, so it's not about 'hunting' girls. It's all about having a good time in a bar or club. Something different than Bui Vien (or something located on Bui Vien but not really tourist-heavy). Do you guys have some tips and tricks for us three?

 It seems like I may be going to Vietnam sometime in December 2023/January 2024. I am still waiting for e-visa to be approved. What will the weather be like there at around this time? Is there any trains going in/out of the different cities? I ask because I tried googling it and it gave me nothing. 
 This is my first time in Vietnam. We will be flying in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), I have no itinerary right now, but what do you recommend visiting from Saigon, mostly day trips or a night or two stay overs? And share any other information you want. 
 I am super excited to be visiting, if I do end up going. Many thanks in advance.

 On the shoulder of a road, there was a truck. On the loading area, numerous crates were filled with dogs. In each crate, there were so many dogs that they were stacked on top of each other. Some of the dogs were trembling, utterly frightened, or not moving at all. I suspect some of them were already dead.
 I presume these are stray dogs that have been captured. But what is done with them? Are they taken somewhere and killed? Is that even legal? If they are killed, why are they subjected to such cruelty first? Not to mention, I don't find killing them acceptable.

 Bit of a weird/obscure one but a while back I saw a video about a banh mi place in Saigon (possibly elsewhere but 99% sure). Their main speciality was a huge banh mi with beef short rib as the meat, they put it on the roll with the bone still in and then pull the bone out.
 I'm flying into Vietnam for the 7th time later this week and was hoping to try this place but have lost any record of it and can't find it anywhere. Hoping someone here may be familiar with it and can help.
 If it helps, they also offered a few more different/fancy banh mis including a seafood one with caviar. It wasn't one of the $100 banh mis or anything, was about 3-400K or so and big enough to feed 2 people.

This concept of jumping on a bike behind a stranger and letting them drive you on a freaking bike scares the shit out of me 😅 How does it even work - do you hold/hug them from behind or how do you hold? Isn't the helmet they give you super gross from all previous passengers who leave their sweat there? Is it even safe to use?
 Those are genuine questions, not a rant 🙂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to rant here because this happened on a VietJet flight, but I’ve noticed other Asian airlines have the same stupid rules.
 The 7kg cabin baggage limit doesn’t make any sense! It’s supposed to be the combined limit for the carry-on and the personal item, but both are usually over this limit. Any carry-on under 7kg would be mostly empty. 
 I don’t care if an airline wants to make more money and charge more. They can certainly do so, but they should have reasonable rules and clear prices.
 I just had a bad experience checking in to a VietJet flight where the employe made me empty my carry-on and put half of the things in my big bag and half in my backpack. They checked in my big bag which was now slightly over the 20kg limit and my almost empty carry-on. They kept telling me to make my backpack lighter, but it was that heavy because of my laptop, iPad and battery pack which can’t be checked in because they contain lithium batteries. I kept asking them what to do, but even they didn’t know the solution and eventually just let me go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[👋 hello. American looking for authentic cha gio here in the states. Specifically, many Vietnamese restaurants use egg-based (yellow) roll wrap paper and not the clear, white rice paper. I was always told that the yellow one was the Chinese way of making them, and that proper cha gio were made with the clear ones. (Is this true?) Personally, I prefer the clear white wraps 100% of the time. I’m disappointed when I order cha gio in a restaurant and I get the yellow kind. Does anyone know how I can ask what kind of paper they use and what answer reflects my preferences? Will a Vietnamese restaurant look at me sideways for even asking?
 Thanks!
 Background: American, but my (White) grandmother was born and raised in Vietnam. Our family has since adopted some Vietnamese dishes as part of our family culinary traditions, including thit koh, bun thit, and cha gio. Looking to maintain those family traditions in the way I was taught. 😊

We still work out and like to party and eat out and stuff, so the other day we went to our favorite neighborhood spot for some grub. There were about 30 of us, and although we can’t see a thing, we have excellent hearing and some of us speak English.
 So we were seated around various tables and we heard this foreign guy seeming to have a great time with his female friends. There were all just chatting and we figured out that he was gay and they were out having a “ladies day” of sorts. He was joking around with them and gossiping like one of the girls. He kept saying stuff like “no betch” and “that’s right girl, he ain’t all that”.
 Then we heard the sound of another foreigner and he also sounded effeminate. He seemed to be trying to flirt with the first guy. The first guy suddenly pretended to be all macho and changed his voice. We were like bruh.
 We heard what sounded like hands grabbing plump body parts and we heard some kissing. Then the other gay guy got even madder and was saying stuff like “you know you don’t like them, you big faker” and then we heard footsteps storming off.
 So we all just chuckled and went on with our meal. You hear a lot of wacky stuff around here if you just stop to listen

 Out of the corner of my eye, observed what appeared to be an ethnically Malaysian tourist, a “brownie” smiling cheek-to-cheek, sitting with these very attractive and somewhat scantily, but not unusually dressed Vietnamese females, but thought nothing of it as one of them was my cousin, Trang, and the other two, knew from the High School karaoke club and the local Kung Fu dojo, as one of the other girls was a well accomplished martial arts champion.

We took him for something to eat before we go back to his hotel since we were quite a bit hungry. Although a bit drunk, he agreed. While eating, he was a bit handsy so we wanted to finish the meal quickly so we could get back to the hotel and do the deeds. 
 Out of nowhere, this tourist confronted our John, and said that he should stop. He made a big scene and everyone was looking at us. We thought the tourist was going to get into a fight with our John, so instead of it escalating, me and my girls just paid for the food and got out of there ASAP. 
 ​
 Guys, how do I avoid situation like this? Do I get handsy myself on the John so that tourist don't think that I'm being kidnapped?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look nothing against tourist as I am a tourist as well. I tour Vietnam quite often from Maylasia, and this is starting to happen more frequently. I was minding my own business and having fun with three other Viet women. They were like 45 kilograms of chicken these women. The women were enjoying themselves with the drinks I was buying. I was balling out with these 45 kilogram chicken and they were loving it. Then all the sudden this crazy tourist comes over trying to be a hero and tell me to take my hands off the product. I ignored him as I paid for these women, so I kissed them. He said something again about me touching the woman. So I grabbed the women again to piss him off and kissed them as well. The guy looked miserable. Like he had come to vacation with his wife and mother in law. He was jealous as I left my wife and mother in law at home. Why would you bring that kind of sand to the beach? There is plenty of sand here to play with. Any how, the women were having fun and enjoying my company. These tourist should mind their business just like I was. We are some hard working men from Malaysia here for some R&R. These type of tourist confuse me. Are they here to vacation and have fun or play some fantasy superhero? If the women were in trouble they could scream or call the police. There was plenty of people around and we were all having fun. 🤩 Enjoy life my people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a fun story I wanted to share, no offense to anyone who digs the style I‘m going to talk about.
 My dad migrated from Vietnam 30 years ago and what striked me almost my whole adolescent life was his particular style of clothing. Like everything has a luxury brand name on it. All in all it it’s this kind of „young money“ street style from 2010. Sunglasses, caps, LV satchel, expensive watch, you name it, paired with buddhist accessories. From a fashion standpoint it’s completely randomly combined. This stands out even more since no other 60 year old man dresses this way in the country I grew up in. Though I’d say especially migrant groups tend to do that as well as a status symbol though there‘s something, besides the jade bracelets and stuff, that makes it so different and I really can‘t say what.
 And then, in 2019, I visited Vietnam for my first time. And when I walked around Bui Vien street or took the local busses, I’ve seen other middle aged men that radiated some thuggish ominous vibe like bouncers and I realized They wear the same outfits!! I don‘t know what exactly made it so similar but the composition of their outfits reminded me immediately of my dad. I had the feeling they wore even more accessories like a watch but also a jade bracelet and a wooden pearl bracelet on the same arm. It‘s so weird hahaha but now I know, where he got that inspiration from

 Don't think the school has a hall to contain the noise so that means neighbors have to wake up when they start their practice session...at 7am.

She is from vietnam and started a successful nail salon in the United States with her family. I was chatting with her and I said the acetone solution looks like Kool aid and she said she doesn't know what Kool aid is and has never had it. As gross as it may sound to some Kool aid was a big part of my life growing up and while I don't drink it in adulthood since its not the best for you I still love it. Would it be rude for me to bring her some? Unopened obviously. I feel like it may come across as rude or making fun of her and that is NOT my intention. I'm posting this here because I'm unaware of the nuances in Vietnamese culture surrounding gift giving and such. The last thing I want to do is offend her.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, me and a friend will be travelling through Vietnam this december and are planning to spent most of our time in the North of Vietnam especially in the Sa Pa area for some hiking and being in mother nature. We‘re a bit worried that during this time of the year the nature isnt as beautiful due to the rice already being harvested and the weather being very rainy or cloudy. What has been your experience in the region regarding our worries?
 Thank you very much in advance :)

Trời ơi nó thật là nhàm chán và khi tôi ngay lập tức chuyển sang khu vực khác để xem. Câu hỏi là tại sao lại như vậy, mấy năm trước rõ ràng là rất nhiều cái hay mà sao bây giờ không còn ?

Do you guys have any contact of the local potters from this Area? I’m planning to do this one solo with one of my friends and i don’t really like going with the big groups from other’s tour organizers. My friend can speak Vietnamese btw.
 Someone said this one is one of the hardest climb in Vietnam. Is it possible to do this for 2 days and 1 night instead of 3?
 Thank you guys for the help!

 In one of those restaurant/shops with outdoor seatings on those mini plastic chairs I saw a middle-aged brown guy that was talking up these three Vietnamese women while they were eating. The girls looked like they were half his age. 
 The girls looked much younger than the guy but he was really handsy with them. He then grabbed the head of one of them and then force kissed her right on the mouth. He started laughing in the happiest way and then kissed the other two girls in the same manner.
