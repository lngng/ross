        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning to go to Vietnam for my honeymoon (we're from Canada). We would ideally like to go sometime between September and December (2-3 weeks), but I've heard this is peak monsoon season, making us wary. We would like to visit Hanoi, Ha long Bay, Ninh Binh, Hoi An, Con Dao, and HCMC. We want to do beaches, some hiking and sight-seeing. Would you recommend any time within these months for this visit? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically what the title says. I was wondering if anyone’s used a Grab to travel distance of four hours? I’ve used it for 2 1/2 hours before but I was around Ho Chi Minh City so I think maybe that was something to do with it. Grab will seemingly let me order the ride, but I’m not sure if the driver can see the destination before he accepts or not? If anyone has any experience with this or something like it, I would love to hear it.

 I’m doing research into what could be present as decoration in the home. I want the film to feel realistic to the culture. Question is: what are some items in an average Vietnamese household that can bring this story to life.
 One example i found is a gôi ôm pillow. Articles like these that aren’t too in-your-face are what I’m looking for.
 Thanks for the help

 So I gave her a nickname...Li Lo (Lee Low).
 She doesn't like it because it sounds like a Vietnamese phrase which means 'impish child' or 'energetic troublesome child'.
 BUT...she can't find it online because she doesn't know the exact phrase.
 Does anybody know the phrase...or is she being troublesome?
 Hint: 'lee low' is only a part of the phrase.

 Is Grab available all over Da Lat? I will be travelling with my partner and not too sure if xe oms are safe enough for us, will prefer to opt for grab / taxis if possible. 
 Any scams (e.g. taxi scams) to look out for in Da Lat?
 How would you recommend travelling to HCM? Currently stuck between Vietjet & VIP sleeper bus
 
 Also, if you do have any places of recommendation please feel free to drop!

I want their names to have meaning and it’s important to the story but I also want to show respect to the Vietnamese language and naming practices. I understand that the way a Vietnamese name is written is Surname/Middle name/Given name and that the person is always greeted by their given name but (so I have read). I really don’t want to just use google translate and total screw it up and come off super ignorant. I understand that Nguyên is the most common surname in Vietnam so I have already chosen that surname for my Vietnamese characters. They are supposed to have common names as I’m trying to have them represent a large part of the general public on both the Vietnam side of the story and the American side (Smith is the surname of my American characters). So as for the Vietnamese names I need help finding something that works for:
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Bright Moon (feminine, born 1930)
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Day Star (masculine, born 1925)
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Night Star (masculine, born 1951)
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Caring Soul (feminine, born 1932)
 Thank you so much, I appreciate anyone who can give me a hand.

I am also not suggesting that Vinmec is the be-all end-all when it comes to medical information, or even suggesting that most people here get their medical advice from them. I'm simply using them as an example, as I have seen enough people citing their sources, or mentioning them during medical discourse. 
 Quite a lot of friction between me and my wife and in-laws comes to light whenever me, my wife or son get sick. At first sight of a sore throat or runny nose I am told that I need to take antibiotics instantly otherwise my sickness will develop into something more nasty (commonly thrown around sicknesses are viêm phổi (pneumonia) or viêm họng…]]></summary>

Ever where I look people young and old were smoking out of bamboo pipes. Coming from California they look like bongs but I heard a whistle when an old man took a toke off one and I didn't smell any Marijuana. This morning walking out of an egg coffee place I see a guy packing one of these pipes, he was tightly rolling something in his fingers to load into the pipe. Is this tobacco?? I assume people aren't smoking cannabis, hash, or opium out in the open like this.

The bike I ride at home is a Harley Davidson with taller handlebars that fit my body better. My bike is much bigger than any of the bikes i have seen for sale/rent in Vietnam. Are there any options to buy/rent a bike on the bigger side that wont hurt my back after a long ride from being hunched over?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào các bạn!
 I (24F) am travelling to Saigon soon to meet my family and relatives. I'll be staying for the whole month of february and I am looking for casual and wholesome hangouts with locals as well as other Viet kieus/expats/tourists if possible. 
 I am born and raised in Sweden and currently work as a freelance Swedish-Vietnamese interpreter. So conversing in any language is fine for me (VN, ENG, SWE). 
 My hobbies include: * Dancing (k-pop, traditional chinese dance, girly hip-hop, pole dance)
  
Learning foreign languages (self-studying Mandarin and Italian atm)
 
Meeting and talking to new people (huge extrovert)
 
Explore new places and hangout spots (love adventures)
 
Makeup, clothes, shopping, reading, eating good food, snacking (streetfood etc.)
 
 I dislike: * Clubbing (grown out of it unfortunately), but loud and lively bars are fun! 
  
Selfish and egocentric people 
 
Gambling (not for me, and I lose all the time at tiếng lên 😭)
 
Alcohol in large quantities. I'm not much for the nhậu culture but I'm fine if other people wants to do it as long as it doesn't spiral out of control
 
 I'm only open for 1-1 meetups with girls. Otherwise I'd love to have a mixed group of people to make plans with.
 See you in Saigon! 🥰

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently on a trip in Vietnam with my parents who have not been back home in almost 30 years. They immigrated to America when they were in their early 20s, so I was born and raised there. My mom's talking to our cab driver about how much Vietnam has changed then as well as the cultural and value differences between the two countries. Specifically their conversation about family values had me in tears. I knew that Vietnamese culture has a very heavy emphasis on family. Most times, you got whole generations living in the same house. Everybody is constantly supporting and looking after one another like parents will provide for their kids regardless of their age. Similarly, even after the children are all grown up, they stay behind to take care of their family. However, American family values is not like that. Sure children love their parents, but they're quick to move on and live their life as soon as they're able to support themselves. Which I would say is true. Lot of kids try to move out as soon as they hit 18 which is considered a transition to adulthood. I think a good amount of them will use college as their escape from home. My brothers and I all have goals to move out, start our own careers/lives as soon as we're able to, and she's expecting to probably go to a nursing home when she's unable to take care of herself. I just honestly feel so guilty and sad that she feels like that. Of course I want to be able to take care of my parents. I don't want to stick them in the nursing home but at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in the same place until it's my parents' time. I haven't thought about anything like that til now, and I'm not really sure what I would even do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I have noticed is that at many Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in New Zealand, the customers at any given time seem to be mostly Vietnamese or other Southeast Asians(Laotian, Cambodian) or East Asians(Korean, Japanese, Chinese) with not many non-Southeast Asians/East Asians. On the other hand, I notice much more diverse clientele at, Italian, Japanese, Thai, and (westernized) Chinese restaurants. When I lived in Australia, however, there were a lot more non-Asians eating in Vietnamese restaurants.
 For Australia, I know that Vietnamese have a longer history there than in New Zealand, and people are thus much more familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, but I still found it interesting how Vietnamese food seemed to be proportionately more popular among non-Asians in Australia than among non-Asians in New Zealand, despite the fact that Australia and New Zealand are neighboring countries.
 So, out of curiosity, at Vietnamese restaurants in Vietnam and other countries, how popular are they among non-Asians? Do you come across Vietnamese restaurants with diverse clienteles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! We are a group of 4 planning on visiting Vietnam for a month in April starting in Saigon and moving our way North (eventually having to come back to Saigon to fly back home). I was thinking to rent a car for the four of us to be able to travel from city to city to avoid taking the train/bus as I wanted us to be able to travel on our own time and not be at the whim of bus/train schedules as well as be able to make pit stops and enjoy the scenery along the way. Ideally would love to be able to rent in Saigon and drop off the car in Hanoi and fly back to Saigon to catch the plane back home. Aside from driving inside Saigon (as I know traffic looks a little hectic) is driving a car around Vietnam recommended, safe, convenient, practical?

 I was going to book in Hoi An but I’m reading now that it’s super touristy with pushy vendors.
 What are alternative locations that are relatively easy to get to from Da Nang airport? 
 We like peace and quiet, natural sights and good food. My wife can be a bit squeamish about cleanliness. 
 Recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several months ago, I made a post explaining my personal stigma against learning Vietnamese, asking your opinions on why I should learn it (https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/16o5nv3/i_am_visiting_vietnam_during_the_winter_months_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It was during a time when I was nervous about returning to Vietnam and meeting my relatives that I have not met a long time ago. So after visiting Vietnam and meeting my family and talking them (in English), I kind of have some newfound respect on Vietnamese language. Despite currently having little economical, political, and entertainment advantage compared to languages like Mandarin, French, Japanese, etc. I somehow wanted to take the commitment to learn Vietnamese. Despite these disadvantages, I wanted to learn Vietnamese because so that I can just have a nice chat with the locals and my relatives. It just as simple as that. So yeah. I do not know if people care enough about this post, but that is what I experienced after visiting Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just returned home from my Vietnam trip and would recommend going there to anyone interested in that part of Asia. The country is beautiful and the people are very friendly. When visiting the Mekong delta we stopped at a little village producing coconut candy and snake wine. Tried it, liked the taste and decided to buy two bottles to drink with friends once I get home. 
 My questions are:
 1) The bottle says NSX 1.12.2023., after googling NSX I found out it means manufacturing date. As far as I knew snake wine has to ferment with the snake in it for about 3 months and only a month and a half passed since this was produced so is it drinkable?
 2) My tour guide said after finishing the bottle it can be reused by adding other strong alcohol for about a year, is this true?
 3) Anyone know what the little branches are in the bottle?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today while I was sitting on a park bench, a young man approached me and asked if he could practice his English with me (I know, I know - I should’ve known then).
 After chatting for a little bit he started talking about his dream to move to New York in the States and work as a technician or customer service rep.
 He sat down and showed me pictures he’d made of all the places in the world he’d love to travel.
 … and then he went into his sales pitch mode.
 Basically he talked about how weak the VND and Vietnamese passport are and how strong the American Dollar and passport are, and how he needs $10k in the bank (among other requirements) to get a visa into the USA.
 He showed me these bracelets he was selling and pictures he’d taken with other people he had met who had bought one to help him towards his dream.
 He had a picture with goal prices dependent on your currency and for USD he wanted $32. I ended up giving him $20 (500k VND) just because I liked him and was inspired by his story given that I’m a traveler too. 
 He added me to his WhatsApp and told me that he would text me when he makes it to New York so we can meet up again.
 It was all very sweet and whether it was a scam or not, I don’t feel all that bad about it.
 But I am just curious whether you think this was a scam or genuinely just a dude trying to follow his dreams?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_ethnic_nationalism
 I found this interesting Wikipedia article that helps put into context many of the comments recently about Koreans in Vietnam. It's a good history lesson for anyone interested and puts things into historical and cultural perspective.
 According to the article "Korean ethnic nationalism (Korean: 한국의 민족주의), or Korean racial nationalism,[2] is a racist, chauvinist, and ethnosupremacist political ideology and a form of ethnic and racial identity that is widely prevalent amongst Koreans, particularly in South Korea". 
 It goes on to give many sources which explains the history of Korean ethnic nationalism, where it started, and when those ideologies diverged historically from countries like Germany and Japan.

She never renounced Vietnamese citizenship, but never renewed her passport, and Canada has always allowed dual citizenship. Question: Did she retain Vietnamese citizenship to this day?
 I am reading about the laws and it is very confusing given multiple changes in the past decade. In 2009 Vietnam recognized dual citizenship and said those who had left Vietnam prior must renew their passport to retain citizenship. This was extended to 2014 as very few did it. Again, it seems this was extended or cancelled, I don’t know about this part. Anyone in a similar circumstance successfully renewed their passports from abroad after decades? Cảm ơn

 Im mostly worried about cash. How much cash (american USD and vietnamese VND) should we keep on us? My mom kept saying crisp 100 dollar bills but wtf? Also she said to keep money in your passports to get through airport security quick?
 Also, how likely are we to get scammed? My mom believes locals are mean and will try to scam you and rob you. I just want to get first hand experience advice so I feel more prepared than through my parents who havent been back since the 90s/early 2000s!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a follow up post to Going to visit a woman in the Mekong Delta
 So I went to visit her and had a great time. I stayed with her in her apartment for five days and she basically treated me like I was her boyfriend. She spent a lot of time with me, showed me around, gave me her motorcycle and instructions to explore while she had to do some work. She took me out, cooked for me and even did my laundry. We slept together. And we got to talk and get to know each other a little bit.
 I've never experienced anything like it. She is a very attractive, smart young woman. 
 After leaving and coming back to Saigon I felt I wanted to spend more time with her before going back to Europe in a couple of weeks, so I told her that I'd like to see her again. She said I was invited again and that I can stay until I need to go back to Europe (two weeks). I slept on it and decided that I actually want to spend some more time in the city before going back and that spending that much time with her might be too much for me. We then spoke on the phone and I told her that I'd like to come again for 5 days and she got upset and offended that I didn't want to spend all of my time with her and told me it's better we don't see each other then.
 And that was it. I actually wanted to spend more time with her and see where things could possibly go, but it would have been very difficult because she lives and works in a more rural area. I'm not sure what her intentions were exactly, but I appreciated the experience.

Let's talk about the environment. In the video clip, you can clearly see an excavator digging into the seabed. The question arises: Is it legal for them to build a tram station in the sea? Vinpearl tourism seems to be contributing to environmental destruction, contrary to the "green environment" advocated by Vinfast.

 ​
 I am currently planning my trip to Vietnam. I come from UK. 
 I would love to stay in an ensuite room somewhere in Vietnam as I like the flexibility of not having a long term contract and not sure an agency will rent to me for a short term of like 3 months.
 ​
 I want to as, do hotels offer rooms for discounted price if I rent a whole month?
 I am looking for private room with its own bathroom + wifi etc, and would like to pay around 200GBP a month. IS this possible? 
 ​
 I am new to traveling. Could someone elaborate on this please?

 If you have food itinerary that you can share, that would be great! :) want to try a lot of Vietnamese food/cuisines and or course, coffee.

 There's a dedicated Chinese zodiac sign to these creatures, so if anything, I assume they are instead associated with some set of universal virtues and flaws. On the other hand, biblical symbolism of snake should not make an outlandish concept for Vietnamese people, as the French left a significant impact on the culture.
 So what's the meaning behind a snake one could think of in the first place?

 Four exchange students living in South Australia have disappeared in the past months, leaving police and their host families baffled.
 The teenagers disappeared at different times in December and January and Daily Mail Australia understands police are treating each case as separate incidents. 
 In the latest case, Sunnie Nguyen, 17, was last seen at her host family's home in South Plympton on Monday, and now her phone has been disconnected and her social media accounts wiped.

 However, today marked the day when I let my guard down and someone took direct advantage of it.
 After an exhausting day of traveling through multiple airports and planes, my partner and I arrived in HCMC this evening.
 Exhausted, tired, and hungry, we desired minimal conversation, so we headed straight to the cabs at the airport and boarded the first cab available. In retrospect, it was a significant mistake—one we wouldn't typically make. Perhaps we had grown too complacent due to consistently positive experiences over the last few years, ignoring several red flags that should have set off alarm bells.
 The cab was an unremarkable SUV with a small blue sign and a very modest blue logo on the side, not Vinasun …]]></summary>

 Me and my friend are currently on a backpacking trip around SE Asia. We were planning on starting our Vietnam portion of the trip around the 8th-10th of February, entering from Cambodia into HCMC. We’ve recently been informed that Tet celebrations are during this period. I am personally blaming the fact that we have done the least amount of research on Vietnam as it is the last destination of our trip as to why this was new information to us.
 We have since done a bit of research and have seen conflicting opinions on how much will actually be open/ what we will be able to do in HCMC during this period and was wondering if anyone here would be able to enlighten us. While we think the idea of getting to see the celebrations would be a really cool opportunity, we also don’t want to be stuck in our hostel for days and struggling to find food to eat etc. If this was the case we may extend our Cambodia section of the trip and travel to HCMC at a later date. 
 Thanks very much

 I think it would be much easier for them to connect to customers in need of their service. There's no need to call and asking people walking by if they want a taxi or not, and the app would automatically connect the drivers to someone who needs them. There's no need, and you don't have to idle around under the sun's burning heat in hope of being able to "fish" someone
 For all the reasons I mentioned, I don't quite comprehense why drivers don't just all stop doing the old-school way and choose the digital road.
 I get it that not everyone can afford a smart phone, but the budget line of samsung for example is 1 mil, and usable enough to run Grab. I also get that most old-school, traditional drivers are older folks, who might not know how to use a smart phone. But it's a thing that can be easily taught and learned, just how to use that one specific app, when to click this and that, not the whole phone system
 I know I might sound dumb and entitled, but I have no bad intentions and really want to know why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, finally, I made it to Ha Noi. The trip was supposedly last year.
 Anyway, I noticed there are no homeless people in the streets of Ha Noi. There were no beggars, either.
 Is it the same all over Viet Nam? If yes, does it mean there are no illegal settlers or dirt poor in Viet Nam? Is this some kind of government policy?
 Or, is it just Ha Noi, being a city? Is it just the weather?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks! I will be traveling to Vietnam next month an I am incredible excited to visit for my first time! I just wanted to ask and see if bringing Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) into Vietnam is ok? According to my research, I noticed that the medication is illegal but previous reddit threads have said that nobody really cares if you bring it in, and it is fine if you use it only for yourself with medical usage while there short-term.
 If I did bring the Sudafed with me into Vietnam, is there any chance that they would be checking for that while I enter the country at my arriving airport? If I did bring the medication with me into Vietnam, what are the odds of me getting caught, and what would be the potential ramifications? I am just trying to judge the risks, I know I may be sounding a bit too paranoid.
 What would you all recommend? Would it be ok to bring into the country with me or should I leave the Sudafed at home? (My demographics are 21 M, USA in case if that matters)
 Thanks everyone, and I look forward to reading your responses! :)

 I have read that I should convert my international driving license into a Vietnamese driving license there.
 When searching for rental cars on the Internet, I have not yet found any rental companies.
 Can I rent a car in Vietnam as a foreigner? If so, how and where?

 So I have an ear infection but I don’t particularly want to go to a doctor if I don’t have to when it comes to getting my hand on medication. Do any of you have any recommendations on over the counter medicine or eat drops that you find work? Or do you think I should just go to a doctor to be sure?
 Appreciate the help and sorry if this is a silly question! 🫶

And as I can still track it down in "find my" I can see it went for a trip to Vietnam, currently in Ho Chi Minh City. The location is now updated quite often and not moving so I suppose it could be offered in one of the "official" shops around this adress:
 15 Alley 78 Hàn Hải Nguyên, Phường 8, Quận 11, Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnam
 If anybody has the guts and willing to check it there and help me in this iPhone hunt I will offer a reward for sending it back to me.
 It is in lost mode and erased, so should not be operable without my ID. if still lost mode screen is on, contact number should be "00".
 DESCRIPTION: iPhone 14 Pro, 256 GB, gold, Model A2890, Serial No. ending _ _ _ _ _ _K67H.
 Let me know !

 That said, I've read complaints about Vingroup, as well as Vinhomes. Specifically reviews are saying the house loses it quality after a few years with cracks on the wall and water damping, a bunch of issues that aren't easy/cheap to fix as an individual.
 Anyone who has stayed there for awhile can shed some light for me on the apartment quality itself? My main concerns are is the infrastructure (stuff that are behind the wall that I cannot see or buy something on Shopee to replace) and how much maintenance effort it is going to take me years down the line.
 Thanks all.

 Where can I buy some? I assume markets but I've never seen any for sale in the wild? 
 For any tastefully tasteless pieces I'll be very grateful. 
 As a side question, do people wear these things knowing that the English makes no sense? Is it part of the fashion, I could see it as part of the VNese sense of humour

Before that I ask him how much is it and he said whatever I feel like giving him. So I gave him 50 but I ask my wife who is a Vietnamese to pass it to him. He asked for a 100 for a meal. I'm like wow. Even the grab driver who brought us from district 7 through the jam is not earning that much. My wife of course refused and give him 50 after a heated discussion. He's even willing to hustle a Vietnamese. I mean I'm just sharing here it's not really a scam but yeah. Haha.

 I will like to be more exposed and ask if there is any interesting habits/lifestyle that vietnam locals do that foreigners may not be too observant to notice! 
 E.g. - In Singapore, it’s very normal for us to mix languages in a daily conversion with our peers (English, Mandarin, Malay, Hokkien, Cantonese) - We also reserve seats in eatery places using tissue packets to show that the seat is taken

 I was also planning to do Northern Vietnam at the start of March (Sapa and Ha Giang loop) but I’m worried about the burning season. I’m not a city person and am more so into nature/outdoorsy activities 
 I had to save up for this trip so I want to get my moneys worth. Should I avoid travelling during this period?

 I'm here to seek your wisdom and perspectives on a financial situation that's quite unique, and I hope to find others who may have experienced something similar in Vietnam.
 In early 2022, I made a pivotal decision: I left my regular job as I was feeling burnt out and stuck at a job which I didn't like and started an online business. Given the lower cost of living in Vietnam, I was over the moon with an income of $1,000 to $2,000 per month living the good life, with my monthly expenses being around $500. Importantly, my lifestyle did not change at all during this time, even when my circumstances did.
 However, my financial situation took an unexpected leap. My business suddenly started ramping up like crazy within a few months peaking at around $20,000 per month, a figure …]]></summary>

 Now my scalp is pretty red, irritated, and I expect for it to scab up in the upcoming weeks. Researched a bit on Reddit and found I have chemical burns, which the opinion on Reddit seems to range from “contact a lawyer!” to, “use aloe vera and similar products and you’ll be fine in a couple weeks.” I have no idea what I can and can’t do as an American tourist here.

 Flying to Da Nang on 4/6/2024. Should we stay in Da Nang for the weekend or stay in Hoi An? We have decided to just Stay in Hoi An for 1 night only and the rest of the days in Da Nang as there may be more things to do. Recommendations?
 Flying to Phu Quoc on 4/12/24 - 4/16/25 for our anniversary. We will be relaxing in this city. Staying at the Intercontinental. 
 Flying to Saigon on 4/16/24 for a couple nights before we fly home on 4/18/24.
 Thank you to everyone's help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I’m considering moving to Vietnam to teach English. I’m in touch with an agency which told me that my passport is a problem (I have a Pakistani passport) , they recommend that I go there and start working on a tourist visa and do visa runs every 3 months. Which would give the employer the time to see my capabilities and they’ll probably pull some strings to give me a work permit eventually, maybe. 
 It sounds risky to me right now but they claim that the teachers don’t have to face any consequences in case something goes wrong. (what my anxiety heard : something CAN go wrong)
 A part of me tells me this is not a good idea, and that if I’m working abroad, everything should be legal so I’m not constantly under stress. Another part of me wants to just go for it? Believe in myself and take the risk. (this part of me doesn’t care that I’m broke rn)
 I’m also wondering if there’s a chance for me to get employed at an agency or something? I have a bachelors in Fine Arts and a masters diploma in Photography. I’ve been working as a freelance photographer. I also know social media content creation, video editing, graphic design, art direction and most things creative. 
 I’d appreciate any kind of information/advice. Thanks.

 We have asked them how they found us or why they want to work with us and they said they want to diversify their operations and that they found us through search. 
 Our theories are: SEO, changes in legislation/they want to avoid some taxes, possible scam?
 I need help from Vietnamese people who could give me some context from the market in Vietnam. Why could this happen? Should we be careful, could this be a scam? I will appreciate any ideas or context!
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night me (American) and my wife (native Viet) were getting some hotpot in Da Nang. While we were eating three dudes speaking Mandarin walked in pretty loudly (even for Chinese people lol) acting like they owned the place. They were pointing around and looked to be directing the employees. Both of us immediately noticed and exchanged a look. One of them was particularly intense, staring around the room and generally having a hostile vibe. He was making his sauce and one of the ingredients was empty and he practically screamed that they needed more. My wife said the employees looked scared when they walked in. They also grabbed one of the display bottles of alcohol off the top of the sauce bar and shared it. Neither of us were that concerned because we know messing with random people only brings unnecessary attention, but it was very obvious these dudes felt comfortable doing what they wanted in this restaurant. It was interesting and I wonder what other’s thoughts are, or if anyone has had a similar experience.

 Originally, we were going to take the train as we have heard it is a fine and normal way to get there however our homestead really urged us to take the bus, telling us we can lay down and be comfortable and it’ll be faster. We have always been happy with recommendations so we opted to not take the train and had them book the bus for us instead. 
 However, once we got there it was an absolute nightmare. The reclining bus has 3 aisles, which is extremely cramped despite being 5’4”, it was still too short for me to be comfortable in a recli…]]></summary>

I understand that they have some financial problems that mentioned international flights however, for domestic short haul flights I am wondering if it would still be OK to book it. 
 Anyone actually flew in January 2024 with bamboo airways yet? The fact that they are still offering flights, and the news mentioning a restructuring seems a little bit more promising, as though they are really trying to stay alive. Since we will have children with us, I also want to make sure that the reliability of the flights will be fairly decent. I know it may be hard to say, but any input from people who have flown them in the recent weeks would be great as I’ve only seen post from the last few months. 
 Thanks!

No accidents in 3 years for me riding a Ducati Monster, Ninja 400, Honda Winner X, and Honda ADV150, I took the motorcycle safety course in America and it works and applies everywhere. All of their principals apply to Vietnam as well as they do anywhere else in the world, if you disagree, I'd like you to tell me what part of MSF was incorrect. If you didn't take the MSF course, don't rage comment thinking you know what it teaches.
 There are nuances to the flow of traffic but driving like locals means driving like a moron. Things you never do that I learned in the two day MSF course in America that apply perfectly to Vietnam:

I really really want to do the ha giang loop, but I’m on a tight budget seeing as I’m about to start grad school (as I guess y guys would know, it’s extremelyyyyy expensive). I’ve been looking at articles online and as someone that CANT communicate with the locals would I stand a chance of soloing it ? also any recommendation on ha giang loop (guided) tours? and is it easy to book these types of excursions while already in Vietnam ?
 (Btw my total budget would be around 2500 dollars)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay so its always incredibly difficult to find data on salaries and wages in countries like Vietnam so what we hear is usually hearsay. Usually alot of data isn't reliable since there are so many nuance situations relating to salary which is never covered. I've always THOUGHT and HEARD that hcmc has roughly about 20% to 30% higher cost of living than hanoi and the wages are also about higher to the same degree. Having recently lived in hcmc I've been hearing mixed opinions from a few people including locals and business owners who scouted to market to hire talent in both cities. Some lived in both and said it's the opposite and people in hanoi generally earn about 20% than hcmc. Others say hcmc is the highest in the country. What are your thoughts. Go ahead and argue, debate, whatever, GO!
 Btw im talking about typical salaries for vietnamese locals, not foreigners which are typically higher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I (41F) traveled solo to Vietnam last year. Before meeting up with my group in Hanoi, I decided to treat myself to a full body massage (as it was listed) at my hotel’s upscale spa. The women there were extremely kind and accommodating. I was given throw away undies to put on and a robe. When I laid down, she had me lay on my back with my breasts fully exposed, which was somewhat uncomfortable. She proceeded to massage my bare breasts for quite a while. I kept thinking to myself, “dont be rude this may be their culture, let her move on to another area…” but when she did, she kept revisiting that area. I eventually told her that area was fine and to focus more on my legs and back. My question is…. Is this normal in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been travelling Vietnam for the past 2 weeks and I’ve had a number of occasions where the easy rider has requested a 200k tip. On top of their fee. 
 I know it’s not a huge amount but I think it’s left a sour taste in my mouth. I want to tip people I feel deserve it for their service, not feel bullied into it. 
 I also had an occasion when in Tam Coc where a woman came along and took photos of everyone, then at the end I felt more or less forced to buy the photos even though I had my eyes closed in them. I ended up just buying them to get the woman off my back. 
 I’ve also met other travellers who have said a similar thing about the boats in Hoi An and how they felt forced to give a tip. 
 Is this common? Or have I and others just been unlucky?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 What was everyone's experience like in the Marble Mountains? I'm curious if my own experience was just unique. My partner and I did a deep exploration, and at the end of the trip, we crossed paths with a monk. We greeted him, and he smiled and greeted us back. I was walking behind him and asked if he was heading home for the day. He replied that he was actually about to have dinner, and then, to my surprise, asked if I'd like to join!
 This took me aback. I hadn't heard of anything like this in reviews or posts about the Marble Mountains. He led us to the dining area and asked us to wait. I could see him discussing with the elder head monk and kitchen staff, who seemed hesitant at first. But soon, we were seated with them in the dining hall.
 It was surreal. The monks were full of laughter, jokes, and playful teasing throughout the meal. After everyone finished eating, they encouraged us to keep filling our plates, and the kitchen staff even came out to chat and ask us questions. Then, they surprised us again by inviting me back for breakfast the next morning at 9am, promising it's even more fun then – "almost like a party," they said.
 So, I'm wondering if anyone else has ever had such an unexpected encounter? Or did I just experience something truly unique, a memory I'll forever cherish as a stroke of luck?

 How is the weather there this month? Is it wet and cold and generally terrible like I've heard so much or is it not that bad? 
 When is the exact date for Tet festival this year?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm traveling in Hanoi (in Old quarters) and walked the streets over and over looking for sit down restaurants that served bun rieu or bun Ca, but couldn't find any. I rarely even saw any sit down restaurant in that area. So that got me thinking of it was only a street side restaurant thing? Or does anyone have recommendations for sit down restaurants that serve these? 
 Am traveling with a toddler and can't do street side restaurants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does this sound familiar? Yes of course there are extremely nice people in Vietnam, but I believe every country has people who are nice. This could be controversial, but the reason why some foreigners say that is because they are white (or black even), so they get the preferential treatment. Cos they look different. By speaking a little Vietnamese, the Vietnamese people are super impressed and treat you even better. Vietnamese people are a curious bunch and they haven't gotten much opportunity to interact with a white/black person.
 Can I say the same for how Vietnamese treat each other? How about foreigners who are from SEA and look exactly like a Vietnamese? I fall into the second category, and typically Vietnamese only treat me a LITTLE better after they realise I'm a foreigner (vì nói chuyện hơi lơ lớ). I run a small food business and I see ALL kinds of people. Conversely, if I were white, I'd imagine it to be a whole lot different.
 So yes, Vietnamese people can be friendly (just as any other country) but it really seem like an overstatement to say that they are some of the friendliest people in the world.
 Edit: Just wanna re-emphasize that I am in no means trying to say Vietnamese people are not friendly or ill-mannered or whatsoever. Every country has both nice and nasty people. I'm just saying Westerners getting preferential treatment shouldn't be mistaken that Vietnamese ppl are the friendliest people in the world. It's a huge overstatement.

 With that being said I am a bit confused as alot of people are suggesting we take a bus to Ha giang and then do the loop from there. Whereas we are happy to have a longer trip and go more out of the way if possible.

 Any and all suggestions welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a distant cousin in Vietnam who's either scamming people or being scammed, but I have not much understanding of the country whatsoever... so can you help guessing what kind of situation this might be?
 He's a 20-odd year old with a high school degree but no work experience whatsoever, the type that plays video games all day long fed by parents. Not very intelligent at all but speaks some mediocre English. One day suddenly he's got a 'great job offer' from someone, but he says he just can't tell any details, except that somehow we know:
  
He says his job is just to repeatedly click things; the more clicks the better pay
 He says he 'will get paid' ~3K USD per month, not sure if he's lying or if it'll ever be paid. AFAIK he got paid a little, but three months in, he's still asking parents for borrowing money.
 He must live in where he works, in Hanoi. He can meet parents occasionally. So at least he's not (yet) sold to Cambodia...
 He must work at night
 Once a 'stupid colleague' revealed their IP address or something; entire 'company' must shut down operation and move physically, worrying police will finding out.
 Five people work there
  
Not sure if he's a criminal or a victim, or both. He's idealistic and naive--he tried trading cryptos with worst timing possible, lost parents' money; tried making a gaming Youtube channel for profit but got only 100 views, gave up in two weeks. Wants 'modernising' parents' mom-and-pop shop before he can help with family business.
 Parents thinks he's in an actual 'employee' of some criminal activities... I think he'll eventually be sold to Cambodia.
 What can this possibly be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As in the title. 
 I have been here for some time. I know the country well. There were times I was thrilled to be here. 
 But since the Covid period there has been a gradual decline in my view of living here. 
 Part of it I think personal - me needing pasteurs new. Part of it I think is environment - my surroundings. 
 The volume levels, trash, air and water pollution, huge overdevelopment and bewildering approach to governance has me unhappy. 
 I think knowing I can never be a citizen, I can never buy property, and things like have police doing random passport checks at my house now at 2am has something to do with it to. As much as i've loved the country, it doesn't love me back or accept me and it never will. 
 Curious to see if I am an outlier in feeling this way, or if anyone else has similar feelings. If so, i'm interested in seeing if this is just a phase and will pass, or whether I am in a downward spiral towards inevitable departure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I flew to Vietnam with a small 7 lb (3.629 kg) Yorkshire Terrier. I am trying to fly out of the country next month to Thailand. 
 The only airline that allows my pet on board with me appears to be Vietnam Airlines. When I explained the dimensions of my dog’s carrier the employee told me it was too big. Truthfully, my dog’s carrier is hardly bigger than my dog itself as it is. So any smaller is hard to fathom.
 She told me the required measurements. I have looked online like crazy. I’ve seen small kennels and even extra small kennels. I have not seen any kennel available for purchase that is under the maximum allowed measurements (30cm X 35cm X 20cm).
 It has to be a solid constructed kennel which makes it more difficult and narrows it down even more. The carrying case I flew with is a fabric based one so I couldn’t use a same style for this airplane apparently.
 Does anyone have an idea where I could find such a kennel? Would be very grateful for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to rant. I hate the way the locals drive. But I'm increasingly seeing foreigners especially whites driving the same way they would NEVER drive back home. 
 Was in a Grab today and this guy on his bike kept squeezing to the right side of my grab will riding in between the lane marker, never once using his side mirror. Driver honk him once asking him to go back to his lane. He then moved away and sped. Then after about 300meters , he does the same thing again. 
 This time he gave a middle finger to the driver. I wind down my window and I can see he was taken aback that there was someone behind. I shouted at him "Use your fucking side mirror". As soon I shouted at him in English, he quickly sped off and dissapear from sight. 
 Seems to me that he only dares to drive shitty and show the finger to locals. Doesn't dare to engage when I confront him. If you're in Reddit and seeing this,, fuck you asshole. Drive like how you'd drive in your home country. Use your fucking side mirrors and indicators when trying to switch lanes.

 After reading into entry requirements for Vietnam it says a passport cannot be damaged, but it's unclear what the exact definition of damage is. 
 Does this passport look too damaged to be accepted? The cover has some evident wear and tear from stickers that have been placed on the back but the chip will work fine and as far as I can tell the ID page is okay except the slightest little crease to the laminate.
 I do have just enough time to get it replaced but it's £155 to get it done so quickly and I am short on money at the moment so ideally would prefer to avoid this option if possible.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know it's not long at all, but would love to fit in as much as possible. 
 We are meeting friends who arrive a couple days after us in Ho Chi Min, so have to stay there for 4 days. Are there any day trips elsewhere that would be recommended? 
 We then plan to do:
 2 days Dalat 
 Hoi An 
 Da Nang
 Hanoi
 Ha Long Bay 
 Then we fly back out of Ho Chi Min to Australia on the 12th day in the evening.
 ​
 Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you :)

We are from the US so we cannot ride motorbikes in Ninh Binh. Please help us plan this trip with your knowledge and experience.
  
Should we buy the round-trip train tickets from Hanoi to Ninh Binh now? Can anyone please share your experience using the train? This is the website we were recommended to use: https://dsvn.vn/#/timkiem/ketqua
 Is Grab available to get around in Ninh Binh? If not, how can we get around? We plan to visit Trang An, Dancing Mountain, and maybe Hoa Lu if possible.
  
Thank you so much!

 I plan to fly from Bangkok to DaNang airport and have my DJI-Mini drone with me. I saw some posts about problems with confections in this cases. Does anyone have some actual experiences/informations with this?
 Are domestic flights also a problem? Maybe I can stay one night in Saigon before to avoid this struggles…

 I’ve been living in Saigon for the past 7 years and I’m finally getting tired of the chaos. I’ve been to Danang a few times for travel and it seems like a pretty decent spot to settle down and live a more peaceful life.
 I was wondering if anyone who has lived there could give me some insight on what’s it like and the pros and cons. Or if someone would recommend another city within Vietnam that would be cool too.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I’m from the UK and I arrived in Da Nang last night and I’m staying for a month in an apartment. Today I tried to go stock up on things like toilet paper, bin bags and some kitchen essentials. I tried two different shops which were described as ‘supermarkets’ on Google maps and I couldn’t find these, even when I asked the employee (using Google translate). Are there specific shops for these things? I also try to track my macros and this is difficult to do when eating out / ordering in so I want to cook some of my meals at home, i haven’t yet found a shop where I can buy chicken, veg and stuff like that. What’s my best bet? Is it markets? If so, can anyone suggest a good one? For reference I’m staying at the edge of the My An area. 
 Another thing, I would like to hire a moped to get around the city, can anyone recommend a good hire place for this? I have an international driving licence but not for motorbikes so I need something with a smaller engine, is this available here? Alternatively, how likely am I to get stopped by police when driving around? I’d like to drive myself to hoi an but I don’t want to risk a fine if I get a bigger bike without having a licence for it. I would also like to do the hai van pass but I don’t know if that would be possible on a 50cc as I’ve heard it’s hilly. If you have any other suggestions or tips for me that would be much appreciated! Thanks everyone!

 I love to find unusual things to eat and restaurants with a unique atmosphere. I am sure that some of you do as well ! I am going in South-East Asia on a backpacking trip starting in Hanoï and I am wondering if some of you have food experiences to share. I am sure it would help a lot of people !
 So far, I have listed : Pho, Egg Coffee, Banh Cuon, Banh Xeo, Steamed Snails, Banh Mi, what else do you have in mind ?
 I was also thinking to create a group to share this knowledge along the path, tell me what you think !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my boyfriend met 1 year ago and I met his parents around 3 months in. I'm Nigerian and his background is Vietnamese, but his ideals are more in line with Western cultures.
 When I see his parents we get along and I always have dinner with them, if I'm staying I make sure to clean up after myself, not get in their way and also do the dishes when his mum makes dinner for us.
 Recently I had a problem since he's going to get busy soon as he's starting a new business so I stayed with him and his parents for around 6 days. He thought it wasn't a problem but when I went to work his mum told him that it wasn't my home and that I wasn't his "partner" so I shouldn't be staying there for so long.
 I then messaged her to apologise the next day and she told me that in Vietnamese culture an unmarried girl cannot stay at her bfs house for too long and it's fine if it's a couple of days or a weekend.
 My boyfriend also stays at mine for over 6 days sometimes and my parents are fine with it, but I think it's a difference in culture. Could someone help me understand more about this and let me know things I should be more aware of? 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are in the process of registering for my spousal TRC and it's been one headache after another.
 First, we tried our luck at the HCMC immigration office and apparently the law JUST changed so that we can only get it done at my wife's home province.
 So leaving no other choice, we both had to take days off from work to go my wife's home province. 
 However, once we got here, we found out her home province is in a disagreement with HCMC immigration policy and refuses to issue TRCs, just a 6mo visa.
 With all that said, I don't know what to do this at point. I've gone through lawyers before when I obtained my TRC through setting up a business here and tbh, I ended up doing all the work. All they did was go physically submit my papers. Furthermore, I don't think I have to reopen a company just for a TRC when I'm legally eligible for a TRC.
 Sigh.

 I'm considering a teaching job in Hanoi at a new international school. The start day is early August. 
 I've lived abroad before (China) but have been back in the US for 4.5 years and am currently living/working in Denver. 
 I was interested in hearing about life in Hanoi from those who currently live there. 
 Some top of the mind questions/concerns are: 
 How is the pollution? Would you consider the city clean? Is there a large expat community? Is it close-knit? Is it easy to form friend groups? Are there things to do other than go out to eat/drink? What is the fitness scene like? Is there a road biking scene? Is it easy to get out of the city on the weekend for some nature/beach time?
 Any other tips/advice is greatly appreciated. TYIA!

 i am going to be on a trip to vietnam in the next week, traveling from hanoi down to hcmc over the span of two weeks. 
 i was wondering what the masking requirements are like for covid-19? are they mandated places or required for entry anywhere? are locals frequently using them? should i plan to bring some with me?
 i visited taiwan in early 2023 and things were still pretty strict, and masks were everywhere. i was wondering if vietnam would be similar! 
 thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this isn't the right place fore this post, but it's the only logical place I know of to get the answer.
 When sending a longer (40-60 sec.) video in Zalo chat, does anybody else experience the video and audio to be out of sync? It's like the video is slowed down, but the audio stays at normal speed. Also the file size is really small compared to the original recording. It's like Zalo is re-encoding the video and screwing it all up😅
 Only noticed it recently, and the issue is happening to both me and the recipient. Shorter videos are not affected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are some variety shows/youtubers who have their own English sub (not yt auto generated) for those who aren't fluent in Vietnamese but still want to enjoy some Vietnamese content. (this is my first post so please tell me if I do anything wrong)
 @TheHanoiChamomile: Not all his videos have English subtitles, but I know his vlogs does have them. the subtitles do also have other languages such as Arabic, Japanese, Korean etc.
 @KhoaiLangThang: food vlogger. I think everyone knows him. all his videos have eng subs.
 2 NGÀY 1 DÊM VIỆT: This is the Vietnamese version of Korean show called 2 Days & 1 Night. They are still working on the subtitles. I believe at this moment they are at episode 14. 
 THE NEW MENTOR: This is a show about modelling. only watched 2 episodes but I think all the episodes have English subs. 
 THỬ THÁCH LỚN KHÔN: a show about little children and it's so cute. both seasons 1 and 2 have eng subs.
 RAP VIET MUA 3: I think the title speaks for itself :). they used to have season 1 and I think also season 2 on yt but now not anymore. If I remember it correctly some of the eps miss subs but I'm not sure if they fixed that.
 NGƯỜI ẤY LÀ AI?: here is a link to season 5 ep 1. I haven't watched the show myself a lot, but I know it's a very popular one.
 THE MASKED SINGER VIETNAM S2: only watched some performances but both seasons 1 and 2 have English subtitles.
 I hope this was usefull!! Please give your recommendations so we can help each other out.
 (Also a tip for those want to watch some shows with viet dub: if you have Netflix, a lot of shows have now viet dub. I personally watch kdramas with viet dub and eng sub. I think in settings you can indicate multiple prefered languages.)

 But I feel like my vietnamese language skills are just kinda limited to daily stuff at home. Doesn’t go much beyond it and I’ve wondered how I might improve, or just have some resources so I can maintain a certain language level so I just won’t forget with time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just come back from vacation in Phu Quoc. I met this amazing guy who works as a waiter at his family’s restaurant. When we first saw each other - we couldn’t stop staring. It felt like my body was immediately set on fire when we made eye contact. I went to the restaurant every single day, at least twice a day. We never had a real conversation but we were always looking at each other. 
 When he was taking someone else’s order - he couldn’t stop staring at me - his dad had to tell him to “stop staring at that girl & focus on taking the order”. He’d play songs that I suggested & we’d dance together - all while maintaining eye contact and smiling ear to ear at each other. 
 I was absolutely dying to get his socials & stay in contact but I couldn’t muster up the courage to just ask & when I finally did - he wasn’t there. 
 On my last day - I stayed at the restaurant from breakfast till closing time. He gave me my favourite orders & drinks for free because I told him I’d be leaving that night. 
 Now that I’m back home - I have this huge empty feeling of loss - deep inside my stomach. Thinking of him makes my chest hurt & feel heavy. I can’t stop myself from crying when I think about his face smiling at me. 
 In those few weeks of endless tension, smiles & eye contact - I had never felt happier. He makes me feel alive just by looking into my eyes. He makes me feel absolutely blissfuly happy in a way that I’ve never felt before & I’ve never even properly spoken to him. 
 I am desperately planning to go back to Phu Quoc later this year because I feel physically sick at the thought of never seeing him again. 
 Idk what it is - if it’s just me romanticising just a simple vacation crush & being delusional or if there is something actually there. 
 I feel so empty without him & it’s so silly of me because I don’t even know his name. 
 What’s going on? What do I do.. I desperately need advice/another perspective on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even the popular, must go, places have dirty walls, trash all over the floor, dirty tables, utensils that have never seen a drop of soap. My first few jobs were in food service and half the time was spent cleaning. I don't even want to think about what happens in the food prep areas. Why do people even frequent places like that. Back home (3rd world country) it wouldn't matter how good your food is, if you have a dirty establishment no one would stay and eat.
 Edit1: A lot of people are not reading the text. I never said anything about the preparation of the food. I meant how dirty the establishments are. In my third world country, even in family owned businesses, cleanliness is very important at least just for looks. The prep might be another story. 
 And before people try to pull the western standards card, is it really a western standard to have a clean presentable place to eat? What a way to devalue your own country and culture. It shouldn't be defended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I ordered a Yamaha keyboard before Christmas. It turned out that it did not have MIDI port, so I packed it and sent it back.
 Today (2 weeks later) I got a message saying the package was damaged.
 Here is the photo they sent:
 https://preview.redd.it/r8k1ihypgxac1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=b028b8e050c37a030b675390b258c605a8845d58
 This is obviously untrue because the package was fine when I sent it to them. It means it was probably damaged during transportation or even damaged by these "quality checkers" themselves.
 The keyboard itself is obviously fine, as well as have all the accessories inside the box:
 https://preview.redd.it/yfb64hvvgxac1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=65b1b48fed7bbb2e1ef38ce852b84c4f88fc101b
 I don't know what to do at this point. The app says that they will send it back to me with some paper to sign. I don't want to sign anything because this is just ridiculous.
 Is "damaged package" a real legal reason to reject return? This is not the case in my home country, don't know about Vietnam though. But hey, they could have damaged the package themselves. What should I do at this point?
 P. S., they have my return photo which I took right before sending it back
 ​
 the package is obviously undamaged

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm staying in Hoi An at the moment, just north west of old town and next to a school. This morning there was music being broadcast over a loudspeaker, quite pop, animated music for 30 mins. What was this for? The primary school opposite was full of motorbikes and people coming in constantly. A few kids but mostly adults alone.
 Just nosey really! Wondered if anyone knew the reason for the early wake up this morning!
 Edit - Sorry if I offended anyone, I wasn't asking why people are noisy I was just curious! I did try googling but found no information so thought I'd ask on here if this was a common thing. I'm trying to learn more about the culture I swear! 😂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[okay so i am half Vietnamese and not very connected to my culture. I wanted to hang a flag in my room so i got a tapestry of the Vietnam flag. The thing is i got this one 🇻🇳 which is the national flag. Is that okay? I am actually south vietnamese but i thought the south flag was outdated since vietnam is no longer seperated. Also, my parents think it might be offensive because its a communist flag but they are unsure as well.
 So basically, is the vietnam flag 🇻🇳 okay to hang if im south vietnamese? And is it offensive because i dont want to represent anything that is like communism? Should i just buy the south vietnamese flag?

 I am going to Hà Giang hoping to film a documentary about the local ethnic minorities groups of the region, how tourism has effected the region and about the issue of children begging tourists for money in and around Hà Giang.
 Since my Vietnamese is not very good I am looking for a Vietnamese speaker to accompany me as a guide / translator / interpreter. I don't mind if they are not from a film background as long as they are passionate about film and creative. 
 Send me a direct message and ill send you the Pitch deck and more info 
 Im not sure if this is right place to post this but thought I would give it a try!!
 Thank you.

How much can each of our family bring without declaring? I understand 10K per family but since we're traveling together and on the same ticket, does this count as a single family? I read an article where the flight attendants got in trouble because they counted as a party and carried over the limit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I travel to Vietnam in February and 14th of February I am planning to leave Hanoi and move to Central Vietnam, in Da Nang.
 Fare prices have been a lot higher than usual (95 EUR single trip) for almost a month since I am tracking them. But they mostly keep its high price, they dont fluctuate either up or down.
 Sice its almost a month before the flight, as many know, this is a period when the prices start moving and when you can usually pick a good deal.
 I would like to ask knowleable people about in this, do you think is possible that the price is high yet just because of the expectation and it can still drop down, or there more likely there is a really high demand even the 4th day after Tet (as far as I read, most of the people travel before not after Tet)?
 Do I risk that the fare will be completely sold out if I wait longer?
 I would like to hear from the people who have know how this works, please don't post your advices based only on your feelings if you are not experienced in searching cheap fares.
 ​
 EDIT: also I am wondering, about something. Do you think that if I make the reservation to the point I am selecting the seats, this is a real view of how fully is being the flight booked or not? Free seats means not sold yet or they can be sold to 3rd agencies (KAYAK, KIWI...) but yet not sold to the end party... Anybody knows?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We prepaid 50% for an 11:30 to 5:00 (17:00) cruise through a tour company (900K VNĐ each total not prepay). We arrived on time and received a ticket from the ship personnel which stated 290K VNĐ each. 
 The boat was large and comfortable. We excitedly disembarked at the first stop at a large cave. There were maybe 1,000 people walking through the cave which meant walking up steps was 1 or 2 steps at a time. At points where pictures could be taken, there were no less than 50 large boats present in the shot. 
 The other two stops to kayak and hike were very short and had boats and tourists everywhere. The smell of exhaust from the boats was bad. 
 After disembarking after the day was complete, we thought the tour company made a mistake ( even though my wife is Vietnamese and fluent) since the boat ticket said 290K vnđ and we already paid 900K VNĐ. 
 As we left the docks, the tour company contacts us again to pay the second 900K vnđ. When my wife asks about the 290K vnđ tickets, she is told “that does not include your food”. Our food was a mediocre lunch. 
 Are we to believe that the boat trip cost 290k vnđ per person and the food cost 610k vnđ per person? Haha. Please. 
 My advice is to only book directly with the cruise line. And only do that if you don’t mind paying to be elbow to elbow with tourists
 I will get many downvotes from the tour operators but I bet I get few rebuttals from them

But sadly that I'm not a Top tier educated person, so he blamed me alot. He doesn't care about me emotionally, he doesn't care about my interests or hobbies. He only cares about my study. I know Im a big boi with self awareness. But I have no voice to raise in my family, even if I do so, I still get stomped on then get called immature. It's hard for me to connect relationship with him. Do you have any experience similar to mine? How do you cope?

I had beautiful scenic views of other apartment windows, clothes drying on balconies, and shirtless old men. The location is nice, but sterile.
 If this is quality indicative of Vingroup, my condolences to students of Vinschool, patients of Vinmec and drivers of Vinfast cars.
 I had to cross the busy street by foot (what a memorable experience as a pedestrian) to get to the other side of what I would consider real Vietnam. There I was able to get Com Tam breakfast for 35k, then walk across the street to buy pet supplies, get a haircut, a sugercane drink, and some photocopying required to get me and my pet out of Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved to the US when I was young so I'm not well-versed in Vietnamese cuisine, though when I visited my auntie in another state she asked for a side bowl of nước béo and was surprised that I didn't know what it was. Are there any other food where an add-on is not on the menu but can be order? It would be a shame to missed out on good flavor. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Vietnamese uses the Latin alphabet. But it used Chinese characters/Chữ Nôm up until French colonialism. From what I can tell in Vietnam proper the Latin alphabet is used basically exclusively. But in my local diaspora community and other places I still see Chinese characters along side the Latin script. 
 Is it just because they’re such deep diaspora? Or is there another reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d like to preface this by saying that I absolutely LOVE Vietnam. I have previously lived here for 8 years and have just returned for 5 weeks. And as an American, I understand intimately that no country is perfect. But,
 Vietnamese bedding is the worst I've ever known. The fabrics are scratchy, the blankets are tiny, and the fabric designs look like they are from the imagination of a blind goblin. I can't believe it's possible to make so many colors clash all at once.
 My Viet wife says it's China's fault.
 Edit: This is half satire. Amuse yourself at my expense, I enjoy it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These fuckers work like scammers, yet there's no one ever questioning or trying to do anything about it. 
 -Unblockable fuckers like Home Credit. They just fucking keep messaging you and the best you could do was deleting message history. 
 -Random people adding you to random unblockable group chat. You have 0 idea who was the fucker who added you there. You can't turn off that function where people add you to random group chat either.
 -"Explore"/"Khám phá" tab that is unable to be removed. The elderly who are not fluent with smartphones keep randomly subcribed for random shits in this tab. 
 Edit: Forgot about this shit too: old files keep getting deleted. They are not even that old and you can't control it either. Can't increase or decrease the time where Zalo considers it to be old. -Suggestion of random people which I'm sure 90% don't give a shit about. Like if you wanted to add somebody as friend on Zalo, you usually take their numbers and add them. Not from suggestion. That's like the entire fucking point of Zalo: Phone numbers with a profile. It's the most useless shit ever and it has no right to be on "message" tab. Like Zalo is trying too fucking hard to become like Facebook or some shit. Zalo is forgetting their original users and Vietnamese are too forgiving.

One pissed off tourist was about to smack my head and not the drivers head which pissed me off. I am a tourist as well. It just didn't make sense that he redirected all his anger towards me and started abusing and showing his middle finger. I know he is justified to get angry with the driving by the grab driver, but to almost take it out on me looked incredibly stupid.

Everytime i had a conversation with a Local at a Cafe or a Shop, I just had a huge grin on my face because of the way i was treated, Constant smiles, Laughter and Greetings all the way. Few times i thought why they are smiling and giggling so much when i visited smallest of the local shops, Could be they found something funny about me.

Luckily my driver & the car both slammed the breaks on, the scooter I was on just bumping slightly into the car infront. 
 Posting this just to say BE SO CAREFUL here on the roads. Even if you're on the back of a bike with a grab driver, it is wild. 
 My heart is still racing over an hour later from the ordeal. Absolutely no idea how we got out with no damage and without falling off! 
 Again, if you're travelling in vietnam seriously the roads ain't no joke here. Be careful. 
 Good luck & stay safe yo!

 I am visiting your country for the first time with my dad from Armenia, we wanted to explore asia for the first time and my father being a typical anti imperialist leftist he adores Vietnam, I'm sure you already know your nation has a huge fanbase consisting of boomer leftists. 
 To my question(s): We're landing in Hanoi and leaving from Ho Chi Minh City and want to take the train to see the beautiful countryside. We're staying from 30th Jan-12th February, coincidentally during Tet Holiday. 
  
Is there a reliable website to buy train tickets in advance?
 Do the train stop at some cities so you can go outside and explore it during a short time between stops?
 Is it worth buying train tickets ASAP since it's Tet holiday soon?
 We're thinking of either staying in Hoi An one night and continuing the next day, is this something you would recommend or is going straight to HCMC?
  
Thank you and looking forward to visiting your country! 
 Bonus question:
  
Is it offensive if I wear those green short sleeved shirts older Vietnamese men wear as a mediterranean looking guy? I always wanted to rock those shirts and want to fit in/be accepted by Vietnamese people.

It’s horrible, it’s dirty, it smells so bad, there’s trash and rubble everywhere and I was not ready to see that much dog meat in the street. I tried walking around diferente areas in the city to see if maybe something changed but it’s all bad. I’ll go to the HCM Mausoleum tomorrow and see if that’s any better but honestly I just want to cry and leave. 
 I’m from Guatemala City and that’s a pretty ugly city + crime is bad and it’s still better than Hanoi in my opinion. Where should I go? I want to give this city a chance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been warned a lot of times about not to carry stuff from strangers/acquaintance/friends/anyone on the airplane, because the stuff may contain harmful drug ingredients. If you get caught in certain countries you may even get death penalty. Some of them go as far as using mind control to make you feel bad if you refuse to do their favor, such as using seniors, disabled people, and orphans as a disguise to ask you to carry stuff on their behalf. In my unpopular opinion, scapegoat seekers (i.e. retards that ask someone to do their dirty jobs while reaping benefits behind the scene) are the WORST HUMANS, COWARDICE ON EARTH, second only to leeches (i.e. people that can read the mood but their skin is so thick that they still cross the line). These kind of “special breeds of people” can be found anywhere in the world, from all backgrounds, ethnic groups, so whoever thinks your background/ethnicity is at play here is FAR WORSE than those aforementioned special breeds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a white guy solo traveling in Vietnam. I am currently in Hai Phong. Yesterday some guys invited me to join their table for drinking and eating. They handed me beer, food, rice wine, etc. We kept drinking for quite some time. There was also a bit of weed which they offered me and that I smoked.
 Eventually we go a bit further away, they said to listen to some music. We arrive at some small shop but there is no music. After that I say I am going home and I don't need help going home, I can walk. One of the guys insists I go with him on the scooter. Despite the language barrier, I understand it as if he will now drive me home, so I go with him. Instead we drive for a bit with me barely getting closer to my home and we get off at the center square of the city. We talk for a bit and I say I am walking home now, they suggest I take one of the nearby taxis. It feels a bit sketchy for me so I do not take a taxi and I tell the guys I will walk home. I start walking and with an uneasy feeling. There are not many people out at this time. I order a Grab and it arrives quite quick, then I eventually get back to my hotel safely.
 I am not sure what to think of this whole meeting. It should also be mentioned that I did not see anyone paying for the bill at the restaurant, and I got the impression that I was sort of expected to pay for it, since at one time the bill was placed in front of me. I never paid though.
 What do you think? Was I at risk of something happening?

I can purchase a multi-city ticket that arrives and departs from either of them for almost the same price as if I did it from the same city.

 Q. Is this common? A. Her mom would just ask.
 She never really questioned it growing up nor did any of her relative brought it up. But I was over at her house and notice it and asked her. Me and my friend tried searching it up on online but haven’t had much luck in this subject.

She was fighting, kicking and crying. Everyone just looked, it was a crowded street, the taxi drove of. I ran after it after a bit of hesitation, luckily there was oncoming traffic so I was able to catch up to the car. I opened the taxi drivers front door and told him to let the women out. He tried unlocking the door but the man locked the door always from inside and yelled at the driver to drive away. Finally I was able to open the door, the women sadly just ran away, I tried to keep the dude contained by holding the door, but he pushed the door open, punched me and then ran after the women. After I got my footing back I ran after them, but I wasn’t able to locate them by foot. I tried asking expats to follow them on the bike but no one wanted to.. so I sprinted to the police in Thao dien, who also seemed disinterested… I don’t know how to feel.

 Looking for some information, I came across this beautiful image of somewhere in the north region of Vietnam, touching China. According to the photographer’s caption on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/p/Cwu_Wd6oIUV/?igsh=MWMycGgzZWh1bHVjeQ==), the mountains at the end of the image are China, and this little river and valley is Vietnam (the northern part).
 Can anyone identify where exactly it is? We’d love to see this in person but the photographer doesn’t respond our messages…

What caused these? Thanks.

Em hiện là sv năm 4, cbi ra trường của một trường khá có tiếng về ngoại ngữ ở hcm. Chuyên ngành của e thì lại k có tính áp dụng cao (thiên về chính trị), đa số quá trình học chủ yếu là chạy dl trên lý thuyết... Nên bây giờ gần ra trường nhưng em lại rất sợ vì không có chuyên môn. Sơ lược thì hiện tại em có Toeic 800+, Vstep B2, em đang có mục tiêu học Tiếng trung và trước khi tốt nghiệp có HSK3. Tuy nhiên, em không biết em phải đi theo con đường gì với những gì e đang có. Đa số bạn em theo Hr, e hướng nội + nhát gan k biết có nên theo không. Em cũng có định hướng theo logistic, và đang có ý định tìm job intern về những mảng này, nhưng chuyên môn em không có gì, ngành học k liên quan nên đa số k ai nhận. Các a chị cho e lời khuyên về con đường e nên theo với những thứ e đang có với ạ. Thời gian này em tiêu cực lắm, đôi khi e còn nghĩ về việc tồi tệ nhất... Nhà e cũng k khá giả, bame mắc nợ nhiều nên e k muốn bị thất nghiệp sau ra trường đâu ạ. Em hi vọng có người chỉ lối cho em vài tháng trước khi em tốt nghiệp ạ. Vài tháng này có thể sẽ thay đổi số phận 1 người được đó ạ 🥺. E bế tắc lắm, e mong có thể có 1 mentor cứu e về tương lai lẫn tinh thần hiện tại...

 I am going to Vietnam 20th Jan-9th February with a friend and just wondered if you can drop any tips/advice or anything that might be helpful for first time long distance travellers from the UK! 
 I have tried to work out the travel situation (grab seems good?) and it appears cash is preferred option but also have access to credit card when there. 
 We have booked accommodation in the following areas : Hanoi, halong bay, cat ba national park, nin binh and day trip to cu national park and then back to Hanoi before travelling home. 
 So any places to go/things not to miss and general tips would be so appreciated.

 The first meal was amazing and she obviously put in a lot of effort. I’d really like to bring something as a show of appreciation. 
 I was thinking a dessert from a shop in town, or maybe some gifts for their young 8 and 3 year old daughters. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks 🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dad who is now a viet kieu had brought a house years ago in Vietnam for his father and brother to live in. He had to change the ownership to his father since Vietnam doesn't allow viet kieu to own properties in the country. Unfortunately, a a few years after the dad passed away, the next person to have their name on the property is his brother and the brother promised my dad that he will give the house back to him later on when the time is right even though they didn't sign any contract because my dad naively believed in him. His brother is now dead and the ownership goes to his wife. My dad expected his sister in law to then rightfully transfer the ownership to him or even half of the house because the sister in law did help the family a lot while my dad was overseas, but she retorted back saying that my dad did not care about the family at all and had contributed nothing so he does not deserve any part of the house. We are going to sue her because we have the papers that prove that my dad did contribute a lot to that house and even my late grandpa acknowledged that in one of his old letters to my dad. The house in question is currently for rent as a business. My dad and I found a lawyer through connections and he said to stop my auntie from potentially selling it later, we must first block her from doing that by depositing 20% value of the house to the funds before the court trial since that's how the law works. Is that correct? I'm trying to find a new lawyer cause I don't trust this one and I see him as really incompetent. Pls tell me what I should do next.....

 When I got a chance to travel to SE Asia (once every 4 to 6 years only), I was always buying polos from 'Ralph Lauren' or 'Lacoste' on Thailand markets. If you can select the right models and ~haggle well enough you can have good deals.
 Now I'll go to Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City / Hanoi) and Laos (Luang Prabang) and would be happy to have your opinion about it. Where to buy? Can you find good quality? Are prices OK?
 Thank you in advance for any 'tip' or information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[there’s an “asian american” accent i’ve heard people talking about, and i’ve always wondered about it. i don’t really know what it is, it’s not really an “accent”, but more an inflection or a manner of speaking that makes you instantly identify the speaker as having an asian background even though you can also tell they’re a native english speaker. even some of my friends who had english as a first language still have traces of this accent.
 i was born and raised in the US but i have a somewhat noticeable accent, cause my parents immigrated shortly before i was born and only spoke viet at home. tbh i’m grateful i don’t just know englsih and can speak viet (not fluently but conversationally) but sometimes it’s hard to speak english after a while living back with my parents lmao. for example some of my vowels and consonants sound viet. words like “cold” i might accidentally pronounced as “code” and “social” as “so sho”, “your” comes out as “yer.” it’s weird when i tell ppl about this bc they’re like “uhhhh weren’t you born in orange county…?” and i’m like “yeah lmao but my english still isn’t great🧐” i still speak english fluently but often it’s hard to express myself fully (without pausing) and pronouncing words that have sounds which don’t exist in VN 
 does anyone else have this “accent”? how do you make it less noticeable?

Mình sống tâm lý chán nản ko có động lực trầm cảm lâu rồi, mỗi ngày chỉ ăn ngủ xem phim nghe nhạc chơi game, không làm đc gì kiếm ra tiền, đi làm ở ngoài xh thì mình sợ tiếp xúc nên trốn ở nhà.

Mình yếu kém, ko có năng lực ko làm đc tích sự gì, kĩ năng giao tiếp kém, mình muốn thay đổi để ko bị coi thường chứ nhưng tinh thần mình trước ngoại cảnh mình hay bị yếu đuối nên kéo theo việc ngáo ngơ dễ bị đánh giá, nên mình tránh tiếp xúc con người.

And i thought I had plenty of time to spend and travel from hcmc all the way up to sapa and ha giang… but the more i search, more i reliase that i don’t have enough time for all. 
 For now my itinerary looks like this
 Feb 4,5,6 Hcmc
 Ride a overnight train to danang 
 Feb 7 One night in hoi an Feb 8 One night in danang
 morning Flight to hanoi then bus to ninh binh 
 Feb 9,10,11 Two nights in ninh binh
 Return to hanoi, halong bay or cat ba cruise
 Feb 12,13 overnight cruise
 Return to hanoi then night train to sapa
 Feb 14,15,16 two nights in sapa
 Bus to ha giang
 Feb 17,18,19,20 Three nights in ha giang
 Return early to hanoi feb20
 Chill at hanoi feb 21
 Am i putting myself into too much things to do? Tbh if i had known theres not much to enjoy in south i wouldve flown to danang as im more interested in nature and sightseeing. But since i have already booked my ticket and its quite pricy to change it… what could be the best option for now?

 I have tried to convince her saying I do not want to go to the US, but she doesn't care. She is convinced that it is good for me, and even more so since my older brother is also there, who went to and graduated from the same university.

 I moved here right after finishing high school a few months ago. So now I am here in the US, Alabama (terrible state I know, I was forced to, it was not my choice).…]]></summary>

I have never really wanted to settle and study here but now it is like I was forced to live like this for possibly years before becoming on my own. It's not America per se that is the problem, but the circumstance under which I got here. TL;DR at the end of this Ted talk. 
 To start with, my family really wanted us to study abroad and hopefully move to the US as I grow up, considering my other relatives already living there. Tbh, I had no interest in going to the US to "seek opportunity" and I surmised life would be depressing to me, at least. So I continued minding my own business in high school: making friends, getting grades, dating. In 10th grade, the concern of studying abroad rose to me, but I was …]]></summary>

I have celebrated the Lunar New Year with him/his family for the past 3 years, and there's a Tết festival we will be attending this year. I would really love to get an ao dai and wear it to the festival- I've only ever worn normal clothes. I think they're beautiful and since I plan on marrying my boyfriend I would like to embrace his culture as much as I can. I'm honestly a little shy to ask him about wearing one, he was born here and is pretty Americanized so I'm not sure if he'll think it's weird if I asked.

 Also looking for this weasel and mountain coffee. Is it worth it or just hype? Where to buy them that's not in exorbitant prices. I once bought hazelnut roasted beans (not in Vietnam) that smelled so good but was rather bland or weak in taste. Somewhat they took the coffee taste away but infused the smell.
 The coffee flavors here are sweet like those instant 3 in 1. The saigon, egg and salted coffee were the least of my favorites. Coconut coffee is...yeah unique i like the most.

 My experience below was pretty ass. Are there any public pickup spots for basketball in Hanoi? Would love to meet up for some games next year when I’m there. 
 -Sân Bóng Rổ HK Sport: Came at 6pm on a Friday. No entrance fee but zero people at the basketball court. It looked nice though, I left immediately. -Sân Bóng Rổ CLB Ba Đình: Came at 5pm on Friday. Security at the facility main gate said they are fixing the court and it’s closed. Not sure I even went to the right place though. -The New Quarter (612 Đ. Hoàng Hoa Thám, Bưởi, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam): Arrived 6:30pm on Friday. Nice one and half courts. About 25 people mostly teenagers shooting around. A group seemed to have reserved the full court for a party without playing any games. I shot around for an hour before asking to start playing 3’s. After the game ended, some guys said their friends showed up and started their own games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our hostel warden gave us the worst possible experience just now. We have a booking for 4 of us and we had a friend drop by to our private room to use washroom facilities. The warden threw a hissy fit and started yelling and raising hell and gave us a very rough time. Plus, there was no way to properly explain to him that it was just a friend dropping by a bit, and not an escort - since he doesn’t understand english. 
 He harasses us further by locking us in and not letting our friend out for about an hour. He then threatened to report us to police and demanded money to the tune of 30 million dong (which he said was to pay the cops). He also refused to get us the manager. We are all very shaken by this experience, and are quite convinced it wasn’t lawful at all. After he realised that he wasn’t getting a penny out of us, he calmed down after a bit and opened the shutters.
 What can we do about it?
 P.S: We’re in HCMC, and booked the hostel via Hostelworld.

 I’m planning to visit Vietnam in January/February for a bit more than 3 weeks.
 I will arrive in Hanoi and will return from HCMC.
 The idea was to explore the northern part of Vietnam and to do Hi Giang loop, but I understand that it is not recommend due to bad weather ?
 It’s surprising because I have found many website telling that the weather would be cold and dry.
 Any opinions?
 Many thanks !!

 As many westerns who love to explore eating, I absolutely fell in love with the Bahn Mi; especially Vietnamese Ham (Cha Lua) which I just adore so much I want to make my own. My biggest worry with creating this delectable meat is botulism. I would like to follow the recipe bellow and have all of the ingredients and equipment to do so:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXqvP7y0WM
 Is there any risks of botulism by using this method?
 If you make a really big batch can you vacuum pack the rest and store in the freezer? Any botulism or food risk there?
 I really would like to explore this but it is very new for me and I want to be as safe as possible.
 Thank you very much for time.
 Kevin

 As an Indian, I visited Vietnam recently and I noticed that cab drivers, hotel managers, tour guides, or the people in general whom I met welcomed me and showed positive gesture towards me. During my trip, I visited only famous places which are often visited by any tourist. But, I want to understand the sentiment of any Vietnamese towards Indians who not necessarily reside in those cities.

Last month I've matched with a woman (32F) on Tinder who lives in Tra Vinh. She's a university professor and says that she's unconventional for her environment (isn't looking for marriage and having kids). We've had a couple of video calls and she seems genuine and honest. 
 So she invited me to visit her at her home for a couple of days. Given that I'm a foreigner in this country it makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable especially because I've never received such an invitation before.
 Am I going to be abducted or am I being a bit paranoid? Anything I should be worried about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an American living and working in Hanoi. I'm trying to become more educated on Vietnamese table manners. This topic has been frustrating to me. My Vietnamese girlfriend and my Vietnamese friends have commented on some of my bad table manners. It's been difficult for me to try and change my eating habits. 
 Here are some of the things I experienced:
  
Vietnamese share their meals. My girlfriend told me that I should share food so I don't appear selfish. Usually in the US, my friends and I would just share an appetizer and then I would just eat the dish I ordered. I also had difficulty adjusting to this because I was concerned with hygiene. 
 Vietnamese aren't so finicky with hygiene. My friends share food using the same chopsticks they eat with, and when I have beer with friends they handle the ice cubes with their hands. Surprising at first, but I don't make a fuss about it.
 I shouldn't accept food using my chopsticks when someone is offering food with their chopsticks. I just did this once, and people told me I shouldn't do it. I'm not sure why it is rude though. 
 I shouldn't eat fast. My girlfriend told me it looks bad. I guess I eat fast, but for me it's my normal pace. I didn't have long lunch breaks in school/work in the US, so I guess that's why.
 I have to let old people eat first. I usually don't eat with older people, but I was told about this. I had food with a friend's family, and I didn't eat until her grandparents started eating. 
  
I read a few more online, but I don't know what's true. For example, it's unlucky to flip a whole fish when eating. I have a Chinese uncle who that told me about that, but my girlfriend never heard of it.
 I hope I can receive some feedback and tips on improving my table manners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Em hiện giờ đang học lớp 12. Từ khi lên cấp 3 em quyết định đi du học nên em hoàn toàn chăm chú thực hiện mục đích đó thôi - đến trên lớp em cũng chỉ cày điểm ngang mức yêu cầu của bên trường đh đó, còn từ khi lên 12 thì em gần như bỏ hết mấy môn không cần thiết mà chỉ tập trung một vài môn yêu cầu thôi. Thế nhưng mới 2 tuần trước mẹ em lại bị diagnosed with ung thư tử cung giai đoạn cuối ạ. Gia đình em ngoài mẹ ra thì chỉ có nguồn thu nhập là ba em - là giáo viên nên lương ba cũng ko cao. Em thì vẫn ưu tiên việc chữa trị của mẹ nên việc du học ko thực hiện được thì vẫn ok. Nhưng về ngành mà em muốn học (Thiết kế đồ hoạ), thì cả gia đình em đều phản đối nếu học ở Việt Nam í, vì ngành đó ko phát triển ở đây. Ngoài ngành đó ra thì em thực sự không muốn hay đam mê học ngành nào khác. Em cũng chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến việc học ở Việt Nam... Nhưng rồi em cũng chỉ còn 5 tháng nữa để tốt nghiệp thôi ạ, nên cần quyết định càng sớm càng tốt i. 
 Theo mn nghĩ thì em nên take gap year không ạ? Em ko quan tâm đến việc thụt lùi so với mấy bạn đồng lứa hay opinion mấy người xung quanh đâu, chỉ cần là hướng đi tốt thì em sẽ cân nhắc ạ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been studying Vietnamese for about a month now and I’ve acquired some sentences and words. However, I did notice that there’s two dialects/accents to Vietnamese. When I look on TikTok I always see southern Vietnamese people talking about how the northern accent is complicated and sometimes hard to understand. But at the same time, most Vietnamese songs are written in the northern dialect and most apps only teach the Northern dialect. As a person who lives in the United States, I’ve seen sources state that most Vietnamese Americans speak with the southern dialect. Obviously I would want to make learning Vietnamese as easy as possible by learning the most commonly used dialect or easiest dialect to learn and understand. So this leads me to my question, should I learn the northern or southern dialect?

 My current plan is 2 nights in Saigon (XO Food Tour on motorbike, Cu Chi Tunnels, Mekong Delta), 2 nights in Hoi An (bike tour, basket boats, etc.), and 3 nights in Hanoi (possibly with a trip to Ha Long Bay). I will be flying between all of these.
 Am I doing too much? Should I cut one of these out of my trip and extend time in the other two places?

 Which providers can you recommend and how can I find a good provider who will give us a nice tour?

 I’m coming back to stay for a year and haven’t been keeping up with the changes in Vietnam. After quite a bit of researching, found surprising amounts of innovations and quality of life changes.
 For example: 
 Grab now offers food/packages/personal items delivery.
 Online transactions are a lot more prominent now than before and of course the growth of massive commerce space like Lazada and shopee
 Paying with virtual wallet is a thing
 My general question is,
 What major quality of life changes have happened the past 7 years?

 If we want any apology or recognition from Japan we must first acknowledge and apologize for this stain on our nation’s soul.
 I’m just kind of in abject horror right now that it took me so long to learn about this.

 I will be traveling to HCMC in February for 4 weeks. This is my once in a lifetime dream trip and I really want to get the most out of it but I think my itinerary wishlist has grown a little out of control... I'm hoping people will have input on places to spend 1-2 days (or just skip completely?)
 At a minimum, I'm hoping to go to: HCMC (both for Tết and for arrival/departure) Phú Quốc Đà Nẵng Huế A cruise at Vịnh Hạ Long, Vịnh Bái Tử Long, or Vịnh Lan Hạ
 The plan is to spend maybe 1 day in Hà Nội
 The nice-to-haves: Cần Thơ, Hội An, Ninh Bình, and Cam Ranh.
 I went for 2 weeks before and was able to visit HCMC, Đà Lạt, Nha Trang, and Vũng Tàu and didn't feel it was too much but I think I'm over the limit this time.
 Sorry... that's a lot of info but if anyone has opinions, I would love to hear them! :) Cảm ơn nhiều

 Mình hiểu qua cách chơi đề, bạn ra quán nước chọn một con số rồi chờ cuối ngày đề về. Nếu trùng số thì 1 ăn 70 hay 80 gì đó.
 Nhưng ai là nhà cái, có phải các chủ quán nước tự quản không hay họ có “cấp trên” là nhà cái tổng? Nếu có nhà cái tổng thì các quán nước cấp dưới của họ thu lợi nhuận như thế nào?
 Có hệ thống phân cấp rạch ròi như kiểu một công ty hay Giáo hội không? Các nhà cái có nhà cái cấp trên và cứ thế đi lên tới một ông sếp cuối cùng? Nếu có thì ông này là ai và làm thế nào để ngoi lên được chức đó? Nếu không thì các nhà cái hoạt động như những đơn vị độc lập có cạnh tranh trực tiếp với nhau không và như nào? Họ có tranh giành địa bàn, cạnh tranh tỉ lệ thắng, thâu tóm khách hàng?
 Vai trò của công an trong hệ thống chơi đề như thế nào?

As opposed to buying here online from US? Google flights shows flight from hanoi to HCMC for $600usd. If I wait and purchase online from Vietnamese airlines, will I be cheaper? What about once I've arrived and seeing a travel agency for this? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 ​
 My mates (foreigners) and my gf (Vietnamese) will tour Vietnam in February while she is visiting home for Tet.
 I am planning for an itinerary for Ha Long where I will arrive on the evening of 5th Feb and leave for Hanoi on the 8th of Feb in the early afternoon giving us a full day (7 Feb to plan day activities).
 We have an accommodation planned in Ha Long city for the days. Can anyone suggest if there can be some alternatives to cruise trips for the days that we are there? I have heard about some tours in Cat ba island but not sure how to choose them yet.
 I am looking to find alternatives to the Ha Long cruise for a few reasons - 
 - My gf thinks it's dangerous and she doesn't want to go on an overnight cruise because she is just visiting there for photos(?)
 - Cruise may be a bit expensive for some of us. I am finding people suggesting against cheaper tours and so may have to look at something atleast upwards of $200 USD for an overnight tour.
 ​
 I am happy to receive any counterarguments and maybe I can convince my gf if there are some suggestions to go for it. 
 Would anyone be able to suggest some tours or any day activities that can get us most of Ha Long/Cat Ba for the duration we are there?
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out walking and came upon this lady outside Coffee 31. The line and delivery pickups was crazy. We ordered one based on the line alone and then asked someone else nearby with one what it was. They gave us the name of the dish, xoi xeo, but other than sticky rice and crispy onion, we're not sure exactly what all was on it. I only wish we'd found this earlier because it was quite possibly one of the best things I've had in a long time. Online search wasn't helpful and gave variations, I'm curious what's on this one...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m currently in Vietnam and I’m starting to realize my preferences. I’m going to break down the cities I like and the cities I don’t like with the hope that people could help give me insight to where I would like to go in the future as I spend 2-3 more weeks here going south. 
 Like: Hanoi, Ha Giang, Ninh Binh, Da Nang
 Dislike: Halong Bay, Hoi An, Sa Pa
 I was thinking of going to Nha Trang, Mu Nue, Dalat, Saigon, and potentially Phu Quoc. 
 I reeeeealy don’t like cities that feel overly touristy and of my three dislikes, they all did to me. Still have some nice things to offer but just not where I feel like being. 
 Any suggestions on my future itinerary in terms of places to add or remove based on my preferences? I am comfortable on a motorbike so that should be considered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I visited Vietnam this earlier this month and just came back recently. I never knew I would like visiting Vietnam that much! 
 I never thought I would want to visit Vietnam again, but now I want to visit every year or every other year if possible. I really enjoyed the food and the shopping, but wasn’t a big fan of the weather (I prefer cold and foggy weather). 
 Maybe it’s because I was always comparing to U.S. prices, but everything was very cheap/affordable. Where I live, it’s easily $17-20 for a bowl of pho or bun bo hue. I ordered 3 bowls of bun bo hue off grab and it was only 160k (the portion sizes are smaller but even if I ate all 3 myself, that’s only about $6.50?) 
 I did a lot of searching on this reddit to see where I should get my hair cut done at. I ended up going to Hair Bar in district 1 - for females, it was 580k for shampoo+mini massage, hair cut, and styling (480k if you want a quick shampoo). I’m sure there are cheaper places, but I wanted to try and get the best if possible. I recommended my sister in law to go there as well, she also enjoyed it.
 For a full body massage, facial, and hair wash, I went to Yushi Clinic Beauty & Spa in district 3 and it was about 840k for a wonderful experience - it was about 2.5 hrs long. It could have been cheaper, but I asked for some add-ons such as the facial and a scalp treatment. 
 For clothes shopping, some of the shops I enjoyed were: Uniqlo SC Studios ($30-110/item ; lots of linen & silk) Rosie ($12-30 for most items, $40-50 for coats) Libe ($12-30/item) Dear Jose ($80+ dresses) Secondee Flanh
 I visited Aufra & Len Clothing as well which had some nice styles, but the quality wasn’t as nice as say, Libe or Rosie, for the same cost. 
 My favorites were SC Studios and Rosie

One older guy said hello and wanted to shake my hand so I was like okay shook his hand he looked drunk and then after shaking my hand he grabbed my junk and squeezed it I immediately pulled away and turned my back on him and got my bahn my and left without looking at him again. Haircut was very good and man was friendly but that was just very weird and I'd never expect that from an older gentlemen, maybe a bargirl in thailand perhaps. Any people experience that ? It felt quite violating to be honest.

I've been in some queues, and especially young adults are those who seem not to care about the line and just cut it for their own good. Imo, it's better to ask people when we start queuing whether they are in a line and wait until our turn. I love Viet Nam, but i hope people will eventually get better mindset to be nicer to others. Have a good day, yall.

Right now I'm leaning towards Binh Tailor as they do women's clothing (my wife wants some as well) and they have good reviews. It's a bit pricier than I'd prefer but want something that is good quality. 
 Anyone used them? How did they turn out? Any other places I should check out?

 I am a student at the University of Amsterdam and am currently looking for native Vietnamese synaesthetes as part of an ongoing research project.

And the pieces of information you can get from this article are the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) score and the rank. Also according to the journalist: "The CPI score is still below average, which means the government is still corrupt".

The incident leading to his dismissal occurred in 2006 when, in response to disruptive behavior from a student, Tánh slapped the student, resulting in a bleeding nose. The school, Trường Nguyễn Du in Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, terminated his employment, citing a violation of the teacher's ethical standards.
 Tánh contested the decision and went through a lengthy legal battle, facing initial rejections in both trial and appeal courts. The Supreme People's Procuracy intervened, recommending the annulment of the previous judgments. Eventually, in June 2021, the High People's Court in Ho Chi Minh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Met a nice businessman from Singapore who told me about buying property in Vietnam as an investment. He’s very bullish on the real estate in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. Sounds like a really attractive prospect since I can’t really afford a home in California. 
 Was wondering how this works. I’m assuming it’s frowned upon but also isn’t Vietnam communist? So can one truly purchase land or is it land use rights? Is there a property management industry like the US? Is contract law respected here? Can a foreigner even own land?
 As a fast growing economy I see reason to both allow and limit how foreign investment enters a country (especially after seeing how foreign money came into the states pre-pandemic).
 Disclaimer: I’m just a tourist and I don’t think I’d actually buy here. I don’t have any personal ties here so I’d be too scared to put significant money here. The businessman told me about police bribery and getting screwed over by his last partner here.

 My 18 yo nephew in-law is Vietnamese, speaks good English and is also starting to read books in English. I want to help find him some appropriate novels to start with, so I'm interested to see what other Viet->Eng learners went with when they started reading. 
 He's most interested in adventure and detective fiction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[as the title says.
 recently my (French) friend who was working in HCMC told me about his Vietnamese teacher's "weird lessons":
  
she took him to a bookstore and grabbed a few 123Vietnamese books (he paid for them)
 "just complete the exercises"
 two (or three, if she's free) 1-hour coffee dates each week where they talked about random topics in Vietnamese (he paid for the drinks)
 she would help him translate Vietnamese things via zalo
  
apparently he learned nothing more than what to say after "xin chào" and a few slurs, and he had been learning for almost two months. when i asked about the price, it was around 300,000vnđ / date and a flat fee of 1,500,000đ per month for the zalo help. isn't that a lot?
 things were so weird so i had to ask about the teacher herself. and after some quick check on her zalo profile: she was a 20yo university student whose major was definitely not teaching Vietnamese. i felt so bad for the guy and i gave him some advices to look for a new teacher or just go to language center that offers better services.
 this was not a "scam", just a plain bad way to teach someone Vietnamese while having a fairly high price.
 definitely a scam where she tricked the foreigner into thinking she's a professional.
 time is tough recently, i know, but girl (and guy) please, being a Vietnamese does not mean you are allowed to "teach" a foreigner. can you guys just be language exchange partners instead?

 I was hoping someone that is doing the loop would be able to make a slight detour and collect it.
 It is on the main road that is apart of the loop, and approximately 40m off the road in the bush.
 If anyone is able to, I can privately send them the exact coordinates, as well as satellite imagery of the exact location. 
 Offering a 1 Million Vietnamese Dong reward I will also pay for postage of just the SD card, and you may keep the drone if you want.

 I saw that many people think that compare a person to a dog is a casual, light-hearted joke. I am not sure about that in western, but in Vietnam, it is totally not true. In Vietnam, compared a person to a dog, no matter your intention, is a serious insult asking for violence. The similar one in the west is "fu*k u bit*h!" or "you son of a bit*h!". So yeah, just don't do it. The only exception is that you intentionally want to insult the other and want to have a fight :)
 Edit: as mentioned by some people "cún" (puppy) is fine for kids and girl friends to show that they are cute and you love them. "chó", on the other hand, is not ok.

 Unfortunately I couldnt get out of the staff whether or not sales tax (10%) was applied to these products or if they are tax free/reduced taxation applies. I cant find anything online really.
 Would somebody here be so kind to enlighten me ?
 Also yes I am aware of the 300g limit of personal gold jewelry when entering/leaving the country.

 I took it to Cambodia pretty much immediately. No one batted an eye about the bike. I drove it straight through. Not asked for papers or nothing. Spent a week there and then went back to Vietnam. Same story.
 After spending a few weeks riding up through Vietnam and getting caught in some heavy rainfall and cold as shit weather I figured I'd cross over to Laos and get some sun.
 I was wrong. I tried crossing the border near Khe Sanh, I think it was called Lao Bao. They wouldn't let me take the bike. Didn't even ask for the papers, just straight up no.
 Should I try a different crossing? How do I get my bike into Laos? Would love to get some tips on this.

 Also, some of you may notice that colors maybe dull or too bright, this is because I am still new to photography and I am on the stage of testing waters while on manual mode. Cheers everyone!

 My partner and I are big foodies and all the travel blogs we've seen have shown how well priced and good the food is there (especially seafood). 
 What are your recommendations for any specific street food shops/markets/restaurants in Da Nang?
 My understanding is seafood will be the focus but all recommendations welcome. 
 Of course, any pho and bahn mi recommendations are a must-have too.

We supposed to meet a friend of my mom around district 9 then he drived us all to Phan Thiet. We couldn't find a proper parking slot but a nice household let we parked at their home. The thing is there is no ticket required. Even though i have some small bumps of uncertainties, i still gamble over the kindness and friendliness in Vietnamese. It may be my overthinking mind. It would be extremely helpful for me to know what is your opinion about this. Thanks a lot. Have a great day too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 My parents immigrated a few years before I was born in the US. I have a bit of family back home whom I've only met once. But of course I understand it's very tough back home and my family struggles often with money. 
 One of my cousins is graduating high school this year and I just learned today that her parents are in no place to afford college tuition. They've all resigned themselves to that reality. My older cousin (different parents) also couldn't go to college and she makes 7 million a month, and the cycle of economic struggle persists. I'm in a position to send money for my little cousin's tuition, unfortunately couldn't help my older cousin in the same way. It is a no brainer for me. However, I want understanding of what higher education in Vietnam entails. More so out of curiosity and wanting to show support in learning about her experience than anything else.
 What is the cost? My family is based in Saigon, what are the schools nearby like, I don't think she is interested in being too far from family. Is it difficult to get into universities? What opportunities does a college degree afford? Googling I found the average entry level salary for a college graduate is 20-25 million. Any other information that comes to mind that I didn't think of?
 My mother didn't finish 8th grade due to poverty and hardship. My brother and I now have master's degrees, it is her greatest pride. I'm now a teacher, nothing is more important to me than education and knowledge. Thank you so much for helping me become better informed!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left my laptop at the security scan @ Noi Bai airport last week. I didn't realize this until I had flown back to Canada, my home country. Noi Bai's lost and found website shows they have it in their possession (they take pictures and post them on their website of all of their lost items). I have hired a vietnamese interpreter to speak to staff there, however they are saying it's not their responsibility to put the lost item on the plane and that it is the responsibility of the airlines. I have contacted Japan airlines, the airline I flew on and their customer service is telling me it is the responsibility of the security/lost & found staff, so now I'm in this circle of each party saying it's the other person's responsbility. Has anyone on here ever lost something at Noi Bai? Can you tell me the steps you took to retrieve your item? (This is a laptop by the way) Any help here would be greatly appreciated as it has just about been two weeks and a dozen phone calls and I have gotten absolutely nowhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a theory, and I'm hoping someone here can confirm or debunk it for me.
 I spent the weekend celebrating Christmas in Tam Đảo (it was lovely, thank you, merry Christmas), and I saw something that I've only seen a couple of times over the many years that I have lived here, but I think there has to be a reason behind it.
 Two big, black, brand new SUVs drove by with the blue government plates, then a meticulously upkept early 90's Toyota corolla, then two more fancy SUVs with government plates, and the guy in the corolla was dressed very well, clearly had money.
 Now, my theory is super wealthy people in VN have their cars from the early 90's, and because they're really rich, they're perfectly taken care of. And the reason for showing off such a generic, low-end car is because they are conveying that they are rich enough and important enough that they were able to afford a car in the early 90's, when this was an extreme rarity. 
 Is this a real thing, or is there some other reason for this? Because I have only seen it a few times, but it has been more than once, so there has to be some reason that wealthy/well-connected people would choose to drive a 90's corolla or equivalent level car, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Vietnamese comment on Reddit told me that I am not Vietnamese if I don't see the fact the majority of people in Vietnam removed the right-side mirror of their motorcycle (if there are 7 motorcycles in the street, there are 5 motorcycles that have been removed the right-side mirror). But I don't see that in my city (Da Nang) and other Vietnamese cities I have traveled to. The vast majority of bikes have two mirrors on both sides. The percentage of bikes with the right-side mirror removed is so low that it is unnoticeable. This percentage may be as high as the percentage of motorbikes that lost the left-side mirror or the motorbikes that lost mirrors on both sides.
 Another Reddit comment assumes that I am Vietnamese but living overseas. And so on....
 I brought it to a Vietnamese forum VOZ and asked if the experience of Reddit Vietnamese matched what happens in the place Vozer lives, they confirmed it was real. Maybe they joke to me, I don't know. But If people are joking, please stop, I don't know what is joking and what is real. What I see with my own eyes from when I was born to now (being a 25-year-old man) is not something people in Reddit and Voz described.
 I am Vietnamese but people say that I am not Vietnamese, even when I have written in Vietnamese in a local/urban/vulgar style that only Vietnamese use. They just said to me that I use Google, Google Translate, ChatGPT, or AI to pretend I am Vietnamese. It is kind of sad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mình post lên đây để mọi người đề phòng với hội này.
 Hải SapaTV là 1 kênh youtube ẩm thực thuộc diện lớn ở VN, với hơn 1 triệu người đăng ký, nhiều đầu mối bán hàng, có nhà hàng và khách sạn ở Sapa, và quan hệ rộng. Trước gia đình mình các cụ ở nhà rảnh rỗi hay xem. Thấy nó quảng cáo bán hàng khá hấp dẫn nên vừa rồi các cụ cũng đặt mua hàng.
 Mặt hàng này là thịt trâu gác bếp (thịt trâu sấy khô). Quảng cáo là để trong tủ đá trữ được 6 tháng. Bán khá đắt (1 triệu vnd / 1kg) nên mình hi vọng chất lượng tốt. 
 Không ngờ mua về để tủ đá, mới được hơn 1 tuần thì 1 gói đã mốc trắng như vậy.
 Mình gọi điện đường dây nóng phản ánh với chủ shop thì chủ shop mồm năm miệng mười, nói lấn át cả khách, đổ lỗi cho khách bảo quản.
 Mình để cả 2 gói trong tủ đá, nếu do bảo quản thì cả 2 phải bị chứ. Chưa kể trong tủ đá còn rất nhiều đồ ăn khô không bị làm sao.
 Theo mình suy đoán thì vì bán nhiều hàng nên nó làm láo, trộng hàng cũ vào bán cho khách online. Ai không cẩn thận là ăn phải hàng ôi thiu. 
 Mình post lên để mọi người đề phòng với kênh youtube và hội này. Đừng để vừa mất tiền vừa mua tức vào người.
 Long story short, if you don’t know Vietnamese, stay away from SapaTV food, restaurants, and hotel. I bought their products and receive old, rotten food.

I’m looking into using a plan from Tello mobile as a cheap option. I read that Tello doesn’t offer roaming, but enabling wifi-calling would allow me to receive 2FA messages from the US. However, I saw somewhere that says Vietnam does not allow wifi-calling and so this option would not work. Does anyone have similar experiences that can help shed light on whether this is true?

This is what we were planning to do, take a day cruise that picks us up from Hanoi and leaves us at Cat Ba at the end of the night, we spend a night, go to the national park the next day and come back to Hanoi. Does this make sense, or shall we spend an extra day in Cat ba? which hotel would you recommend and which activities?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first noticed this on a scooter, I thought maybe they were too poor to replace it. I thought it looks ridiculous. I've heard that only the left is required by law. Do locals remove it because they think mirrors look uncool? I really don't understand the point in it, even if you don't look in the mirrors, why remove them? I don't recall noticing it anywhere else in southeast Asia. Since then I've noticed maybe 40% or more of the scooters in my area only keep a small left mirror on the bike, especially Vario drivers... I drive a Vario myself and look in the right mirror a lot to keep an eye out for any ninjas creeping up to overtake me on the right side.

So Im 17 yo guy, naturally my family is starting to ask "hey you got a girlfriend yet?", of course no, so they reply with "oh how about finding a girlfriend here, marry and bring her back to german?". I was a bit put off because in germany (or west) people marry in a much older age and woman want alot of privacy and freedom. I doubt that that these days girls in VN would want to marry that quick and leave their country, but Im not sure with my lack of knowledge so how is your guys views on this stuff?
 Edit: Thanks for the replies. I dont actually think of doing it lol.

        <updated>2023-12-23T21:23:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chao,
 Next month I intend to cycle from HCMC to Hanoi, with roughly the following itinerary over 28 days:
 HCMC - Vung Tau - La Gi - Mui Ne - Thap Cham - Da Lat - Nha Trang - Tuy Hoa - Quy Nhon
 (bus to Kon Tum) - Mang Den - Da Ban - Quang Ngai - Hoi An - Da Nang - Hue
 (train to Ninh Binh) - Tam Coc loop - (train to Hanoi)
 Ideally I want to spend 2+ days in the larger places mentioned and 3 in the big cities. Now the questions:
 ​
  
If I dismantle my touring bike (front wheel off) and have it bagged, is it possible to transport it on a bus if I want to "skip" a stage (due to bad weather, injury, etc.) - e.g. Quy Nhon -> Kon Tum
 How easy is it to ride out of HCMC towards Vung Tau?
 Away from the coast, is it necessary to book hotels/guesthouses in advance, or can you just show up on the day and realistically expect a room? (my dates don't overlap with Tet). Ideally I'd like to save weight and not have to bring a tent or wild camp.
 I only finalised this trip last week, so probably won't be able to learn/speak much Tieng Viet language, and my tonal pronunciation will probably be wrong. Is this likely to be a big barrier in the rural parts of the Central Highlands?
 Do most hotels/guesthouses/hostels accept card payment?
 For trains (e.g. Hue to Ninh Binh) do tickets (particularly for travellers with bicycles) need to be reserved a day in advance?
 Are there any parts of that itinerary that you reckon should be skipped given that it's January?
 And are there any sights you would really recommend that I've not included? (I've excluded Sapa, Ha Giang and Dien Bien Phu given that presumably it's pretty cold (<10 degrees) at this time of year, and I would guess the earliest days of February in Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay can still be foggy, so I'd leave that for a summer trip, given I only have 28 days). The karst caves at Phong Nga are, I guess, probably tricky to reach on a bicycle too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Just wondering about the title.
 From my time I met with a Vietnamese woman. She was married but wore no ring. Said he husband cheats on her but she couldn't leave him because it was frowned upon by her family unless she had someone else who could look after her. Even then her family would have to go to his to make the arrangements for her to leave him. 
 Is divorce really looked down upon in Vietnam or is this bullshit?

How long does USPS going to ship to Vietnam? I’ve never seen anyone successfully receive their package from US to Vietnam through USPS. 
 One more package I have is using DHL to ship, from Germany to Vietnam. However the package lost update since November 6 and my seller filed for lost parcel. But on December 15 the tracking was back but it has been stuck in customs since then.
 I don’t know what to do besides waiting, but I know where the package is because it shows me the address where the package is at, can I just go to that address and get my package immediately or I need to wait for the customs and god knows how long. Some said that I need to pay import taxes but I thought that items that are over 2,000,000vnd doesn’t require to pay tax. Does anyone know what to do??? It’s so complicated.

 Hegel was one of a series of German philosophers (including Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Marx) in the 18th and 19th centuries who wrote on the subject of historical and social progress. Speaking very broadly, the idea is something like this: A, society exists in a certain state, with certain rules and traditions and practices. B, the limitations of these rules and traditions and practices prompt a reaction against them. C, the established system and the reaction against it combine to form a new system, informed by both, which then becomes part A of a new cycle. A, ,B and C are often called "thesis", "antithesis" and "synthesis".

 Around the corner from my place is a big bia hơi kinda place, and there are always 3 or 4 guys stood in the road trying to flag people down, waving at them, even jumping in front of bikes from time to time. 
 Of course, I'm well travelled and people trying to stop pedestrians is common all over the world, but vehicles? In my mind, I rarely drive around aimlessly, if I'm on my bike it means I am going somewhere, why would I go into these places on a whim? I have never once seen anyone stop for one of these people, so... What's the point? It's just an annoyance it seems. 
 Maybe I'm missing something but it seems pretty odd.

 Possible points to contemplate:
  
How does English compare with tiếng Việt?
 Are you perchance the first, second, or third of your family line to become fluent English?
 Do you use English with your family?
 Did you have to go overseas to perfect your English?
 Has English skill given you notable opportunities?
 Have you had interesting instructors?

There are two that are extremely similar-- same tour company, similar price, almost identical destinations-- except that one travels to Hoi An and one travels to the Mai Chau Valley. I love visiting historical sites and especially UNESCO World Heritage landmarks, but I've read that Hoi An is very touristy and a bit of a let-down for some Redditors. Mai Chau Valley looks breathtaking and a bit more off the beaten path, but I could use some opinions on it from people who have been there.
 Which of these tours would you pick?

My mom has her original birth certificate from Binh Dinh (pretty old and raggedy at this point lol) and she wants me to find out how to get her dual citizenship/Vietnamese passport. She's been thinking about returning to Vietnam to retire soon and be with her siblings who stayed in Vietnam.
 Any other VK's here done this before? I'd love to get details and specifics - A lot of conflicting information online along with just outright confusing info so it'd be nice to actually hear from others who've done this. 
 I've tried emailing and calling the consulate and embassy in the US as well but they've been surprisingly unhelpful and unresponsive lmao.

 I'm planning to solo travel/ backpack for the first time ever to different countries in SEA in Jan 2024. Preferably starting from 3 Jan - 16 Jan 2024. I'm planning to stay in a hostel. Main point of this trip is to learn new culture, explore amazing cuisines, do fun local activities, meet new people, relax, enjoy, take amazing pictures and create awesome memories!
 I think Sapa & Hanoi in Vietnam would be a great choice! 
 What do you think? Anyone can share with me travel tips or where else I can go in Vietnam in Jan 2024?

 Using my regular bank card ANZ or Commonwealth kinda sucks because its 3% conversion rate. What is the best way to get money out from atms in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I looked for some guides on the internet about this, but most of them are from Americans or Europeans, and their dating cultures are so different from each other and from Vietnamese that I don't think I can learn anything from them. So I really need some insight from my fellow people. Here are my questions:
  
Outside of online dating, how did you meet your gf and ex? Are most of them previously your friends, your coworkers, someone you were already familiar with? Or just strangers you bumped into?
 When you're interested in a girl, how do you approach her? My understanding is that you'd ask her out for a coffee, a milk tea, right? How successful were you? How often did you get rejected? If rejected, do you just move on and ask the next girl you're interested in, or do you persist and try again later? Are you usually interested in a lot of girls at once, or just focus on one target?
 If she accepts your invitation for a milk tea, how often did it turn into an official relationship? I mean, is dating supposed to be a numbers game where you repeatedly ask a lot of girls out, repeatedly go out with a lot of girls, just to successfully obtain a gf once in a while (let alone a wife)? I see that most people enter a relationship very easily, so it can't be that tedious, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! ;)
 My Vietnamese fiancée and me (from Germany) will celebrate our wedding in Đà Nẵng next year in early September. We are looking for a band who can perform both Vietnamese songs and English rock/alternative/pop music. We are planning a wedding that will combine both Vietnamese and "Western" traditions - and, of course, our own wishes and visions. 
 We expect around a hundred guests. Most guests will be from Vietnam, but many people from Germany and other nations from around the world will hopefully join. So, it will be wonderful to have people from all over the world to come together, celebrate and connect with one another. We hope a band will be able to play a set before dinner and one afterwards. So, maybe around 3-4 hours in total. Afterwards, we will have a DJ put on some music and we invite the band members to join and celebrate with us. 
 If you or someone you know might be interested, please message me! ;) Looking forward to hear from you!
 All best
 Niko

I am Viet Kieu and can understand and speak Vietnamese. I am trying to learn to read/write in Vietnamese. Out of all the stories that I've heard about, it's very rare that I hear a story from Vietnam. A few months ago, I heard about Dung Hà (Vietnamese female gangster) and found her story quite fascinating. I was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction (YouTube, podcast, websites, books) where I can learn more stories such as this? I'd really appreciate it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I’m an American born Vietnamese who would like to re-learn the language after 20 some odd years of not being fluent.
 My mom re-married after immigrating to America and our household was fully English speaking from the time I was 9 so it sort of fell to the wayside.
 I can listen and comprehend okay (still pretty bad) but my speaking is garbage to put it lightly.
 I’ve tried using duo lingo but I think the dialect is mostly northern whereas my family and friends are from the south so that’s what I would like to focus my learning around.
 Of course I can always speak to my mom now but she’s not really equipped to “teach” it so to speak.
 What are some good resources online? Is it worth it to find a private tutor? I know a few viet friends who learned/perfected their English by watching tv, can the same be said about consuming Vietnamese media with English subtitles? Is that even a thing?
 I think my biggest hurdle is embarrassment/awkwardness when it comes to talking, I lose confidence and don’t want to sound like an idiot so it’s hard to stay consistent.
 Any ideas?

 Is it worth staying in Can Tho for 2 nights, or since we really only have like 1.5 days in HCMC, we should skip staying in Can Tho and just take a day trip?

 I was adopted from Hanoi in 1992 and I am currently visiting Vietnam and Hanoi.
 I wanted to show the adoption clinic to my children but neither me nor my parents remember the address(we visited the facility in 2008/2009). I am aware that we need permission to enter the facility but we only want to see the outside.
 The only information I have is that the clinic was called "B clinic" or "Clinic B" back in 1992 and I believe it was still in operation in 2008/2009. However the name can have changed. 
 Any information is of value as we leave Hanoi on the 23rd of December and only have tomorrow to find and visit the facility.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[am at the beggining of a motorcycle trip starting in HCMC and aiming to travel in the length of country. I've loved my time here so far and looking forward to the rest of the trip!
 I bought a motorbike in HCMC, a Yamaha T135, which has served me well the first week. However I obviously wasn't thorough enough when inspecting it since I've only just realised the indicators are not orange but blue! I'm pretty sure its the bulbs themselves since the light housing is clear plastic. 
 My question to those in the know - is this illegal? Will I get pulled over by police as I travel from HCMC to Hanoi/Hai Gaing loop?
 I haven't seen any other bikes with coloured indicators so far so a bit worried to be honest

Any recommendations for trustworthy retailers in the city? Also, any advice on what to look out for and the legal procedures for a foreigner to acquire a motorbike in Vietnam?

 Are both usage of “tìm” correct? First screenshot accepts tìm but second doesn’t allow. When should I use “tìm thấy” vs “tìm”?
 Please also explain giúp versus giúp đỡ. Reason is one lesson I Learn it didnt allow me to use giúp đỡ tôi and corrected me with giúp tôi. Why is that? Does đỡ modified the word giúp? 
 Thanks. Cảm ơn.

He’s not sure where this picture came from, its relation to the Vietnam war, or if it was even taken in Vietnam. We couldn’t find anyone who knew how to translate it as most Asian Americans we asked said it wasn’t their language and even if it was they don’t read only speak. We think it’s written in Vietnamese but someone told us it was Chinese. Any ideas?
