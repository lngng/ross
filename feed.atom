Question-is it still considered rude to show shoulders and knees in public or is that mainly in/near temples or religious spaces? I keep seeing “travel blogs” mentioning no bare shoulders etc but in all their photos they’re wearing tank tops. Lol. Thanks in advance!

I’m less interested in cost than I am in ensuring that his document gets to him at a specific address before he departs for his next destination. I don’t want to send via USPS, but do people recommend DHL, FedEx, or UPS? And is a phone number required if you’re not sending via regular post? TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to be traveling to Vietnam for about 6 days with only a backpack. I take a few different prescriptions all of which are not banned in Vietnam. I have a doctor's note and all the prescription labels for each of the meds. The labels have the pill identification information on them.
 I was wondering do you think there'd be any problem if I put them in a travel size pill carrier. I understand most people just leave them in their original bottle however that's going to take up room in my backpack.

Sure, you're free to complain, but beneath those posts, every single time there'd be some smartass with tons of upvotes claiming it's a systemic problem, as if old people are instilled in them the mindset an asshole nuisance at every chance. This is complete bs. I've been to the countryside on and off, and almost all old stranger I came across had been nothing but pleasant. They'd teach me how to do things and tell me fascinating war stories. It's actually young people that often scream loudly and piss off people. In summary, grouping old people into a box of "arrogant assholes" because of some vague cultural ideals is foolish, when young people can be just as bad. I'd like to see those dumb armchair sociologists less.

Nestled amidst the rolling hills and terraced rice fields, Sapa offered us a retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life. However, amidst the breathtaking landscapes and chill vibes, we encountered a disheartening experience that compelled me to share a cautionary tale with fellow travelers.
 One evening, eager to indulge in Sapa's renowned cuisine, we decided to try the sturgeon hotpot at a local restaurant. The food was delectable, and it was our first time savoring sturgeon—a memorable experience indeed. But what followed left a bitter taste in our mouths. 
 Upon requesting the bill, we were handed a piece of paper detailing our total: 1,085,000 VND. …]]></summary>

 Me and my partner will be on Cat Ba Island late February and we’re curious if anyone had any tips/recommendations regarding independent hire of kayaks and exploration of the inlets around Cat Ba Island?
 There’s lots of info about the guided tours, but not much about people’s experiences with hiring a kayak and heading off solo.
 Would love to hear your guys experiences or recommendations.

 If it includes travel from Hanoi/onwards travel, I'd like the option to come from Hanoi but then go to Sapa. 
 I will be travelling solo so it would be nice to go with a group and there be some social aspects to it, but I know that Mamas and Jasmine are known for having groups that are too large and focusing too much on drinking (including the drivers). I don't mind the drinking side, but want the drivers to be safe, and want the primary focus to be on seeing lots of cool stops and learning as much as possible about the area and life for the locals. 
 Has anyone had any experience with Buffalo? I will be staying at Buffalo hostel in Hanoi prior to the tour so this could be an option but I don't know if this will again be a huge group of backpackers focused more on the drinking and partying than anything else.
 I will be going in May if this makes any difference.
 Thanks in advance for any advice and tips :)

She barely speaks any English and I don’t speak any Vietnamese. There are no close friends or relatives who can join us for lunch to interpret, which is what we’ve done in the past. I know that I could use Google translate or a similar app but would prefer to have someone interpret because those apps aren’t always the greatest at translation and it will be easier to have someone actually translate. I’ve done a Google search and gotten some ideas but many services seem geared towards businesses or more formal situations. I’d pay for the interpreter’s services and their lunch.

One of them is married; the other is not. I myself am married. (Giving context because my mom mentioned marriage factors into red envelope traditions.) How much money is it appropriate for me to give them for new year’s?**
 And how much can I compensate them for their time and efforts to show me around? If I weren’t in VN, I would have paid my friends in meals and compensated them with gas money along with some extra cash, but is that OK in VN culture? My mom keeps telling me I shouldn’t worry about it, but I feel really bad about taking up their time when they could be spending it with friends or doing something else. (My mom IS paying for a lot of the meals btw. I just feel like a complete leech.)
 Thanks!
 ** I already gave them new year’s money, but if it turns out to not be enough, I’ll add it to what I would compensate them with for their time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 We are in early planning stages of a trip to Vietnam later this year. We’ll have a little over 2 weeks. Our biggest problem is trying to fit in too much on one trip. With that being said, we aren’t really relaxing vacationers. We’re more about exploring as much as possible, usually ok with being on the go go go, seeing as much of the history and culture, food and people and lifestyle etc, as possible. This is typically how we travel and never end up regretting it. I’ve read a lot of articles that say to not attempt the north and south in one trip and focus on one area. Of course, we’d like to start/end in HCMC or Hanoi, and go either north/south from whichever we fly in and out of, and see a bit of everything in each area and in between. Has anyone done north and south in this timeframe ? Was it worth it ? Also I’m a little newer to Reddit so I am open to different groups or subs if this is not the best spot. Thanks in advance :)

 That VNs have "me first" thinking is broadly acknowledge.
 Thinking about how they stick together as a family can somehow seen as good, even if forced. But than I thought, yeah, you would have to make sure it is by force and culturally integrated, because who in the right mind would hang out with a Me always first thinker, if not for influence, money or some other benefits, not forgetting that the majority of the same age group have the same thinking pattern.
 My mother still wonders why I am so cold to her, I explained it enough times, but she doesn't listen, she finds fault in my thinking (why the heck to you even ask if you don't intend to listen? Just leave me the fuck alone, I have really a hundred better things to do)
 I lived a few years in VN, and there were some people that made it a point to seem like the would help others, just to brag about it. That's ok,you do you I do me.
 But the balant interfering in the lives of their younger is just insane. And that I saw in like 70-90% of all the over 60 folks over there?
 Let them live, yeah, give them advice if asked or if you see them struggle do it unasked for all I care. But don't expect them to do as you command and try manipulate them with your pregnancy and all your sacrifice. You sacrifice of your own believe, not to guilt trip someone afterwards. Suck it up.
 I fully understand why most of VNs my age turn narcissist themself, have a alcohol/drug abuse problem or cut contact fully.
 What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a feeling that there is potentially a widespread service disruption for interbank transfers in Vietnam. It is not an isolated phenomenon as multiple banks across the spectrum experience this issue. (digital bank, domestic bank and foreign bank)
 There are only 2 payment rails for interbank transfers in Vietnam.
  
CITAD: There is no doubt the standard transfer is unavailable during Lunar New Year in Vietnam because it is fundamentally a manual payment system even if some banks modernized it with digitalization to bring on some level of automation.
 NAPAS: I am wondering if the instant payment network is disabled during Lunar New Year. When I successfully make a NAPAS transfer, many banks return me a success screen with a norm-divergent message along the line "We have received your transfer request." rather than "Your transfer is successfully completed.", one bank explicitly wrote the NAPAS transfer will be relegated to CITAD transfer while another bank recorded a future transaction date of 15 February 2024. However, I can't find any official notice or announcement about the service outage, whether planned or unplanned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in HCMC with my partner, I'm from Australia and she's from Peru. Every time we go for a walk in the street lots of little kids will wave at us shyly and when we wave back they will light up with the biggest smiles yelling "Hello hello hello!" We have had all sorts of interaction from people and kids waving, friendly hello's, people asking for photos with us and older people grabbing one of my hands with both of theirs.
 I've traveled to a lot of countries and have never experienced anything like this. Very interesting and lovely people.

 ✨ Why You Can't Miss This Update:
 - New provisions allowing foreign entities to buy real estate projects directly.
 - Vietnamese origin foreigners can now own property as locals.
 - The latest real estate market pricing updates more aligned with the market reality.
 - And so much more that could give you the upper hand in property investment!

 This law will increase integrity and fairness in real estate development in Vietnam, for both locals and foreigners. Do you think it is more positive or negative?

She has been seriously ill and bedridden for months. I have been here for 3 weeks helping take care of her. Within the past week she had stopped eating and drinking so I knew death was imminent. However, this will be the first funeral I have witnessed and participated in here in Vietnam. Is there any bad omen/special procedures due to the death occuring on the first day of New Year? I am also "cháu đích tôn" of the family. I have major responsibility in this funeral since my father is not present.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Native Vietnamese girl here. With a rather dysfunctional family at that.
 The day's been nice - We went to my grandparents, had meals, played games.. etc. My dad who is a notorious prideful piece of shit of course got himself incredibly drunk. He has a habit of blowing up over small things / getting stupidly violent like most vietnamese men with some drops of alcohol. Currently trying to assault the neighbor against like 8 family members' protest. He drove off with his weapons, we were not able to stop him. I fear the worst
 calling the police isnt an option because he hadnt done anything and if I try to stop or chase after him, hes going to hit me (he already had.) Im in a state of extreme stress rn and i need to know if theres anything i can do as no one is willing to do anything anymore. i do not have friends or people i can trust.
 Update: We got a call from my aunt. The police found him and apparently theyre working with grandparent's side for things. That's all I know (i'm not allowed to contact them per my mom's request to "stay out of it")
 Update 2 (currently 8pm): the police had let him off, i think. Idk if anyone is hurt. He came home being all friendly again like nothing happened and went to sleep. They have confiscated his weapon. Its a machete of some kind - I know its been in our family for some time, stored above the tall cabinet (I wasnt allowed to go near it growing up) They put it elsewhere at some point and I had no idea he was still in posession of the machete until rn. I dont know if he'll be fined for the weapon. I'll ask family members in the morning when this dies down more as everyone seem too tense for me to comfortablu talk to.

He's saying something like "I'll fucking stab you, no kidding", should I call the Vietnamese police? Judging by experience some people had with the police here, I'm not sure they would do anything in this situation. What would be the best course of action?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There always negativity toward Vietnam, some justified and some not. I want to flip the script of the negativity and find positives. But many posts regarding the positives of Vietnan seem to involve the cheapness of food/products/services, claiming how everything cheap it is. Usually these post are people who live outside Vietnam that makes good money that spend lavishly due to the conversion rate of USD/Euros to VND giving you lots of VND (I am guilty to admit that I also spent lavishly during my time in Vietnam even with my $14/hr part time job). These posts using the cheapness of things as a positive usually do not account for the average money a Vietnamese native makes, making it seem like Vietnam is only good for cheap stuff, despite being more that just a place to spend money at. So in that case, what are some actual positives of Vietnam that are not really monetary related?

We will be doing the Ha Giang loop, then visiting Hoi An/Danang, the finally Hue (our first two days and last day will be in Ho Chi Minh City). I have some questions regarding gifts and donations during my travels. 1. The main thing I am looking forward to doing is visiting Temples. I would like to bring some small gifts and/or donations when I visit. I plan on bringing fruit, but I was wondering if a small cash donation is something I can do? My boss is from Vietnam (I am American) and I would like to bring something to them in her and her families honor, as well as give my own offering and thanks. Any advice on amount would be helpful. Also, If anyone has some Temple recommendations, I’d appreciate them. 2. My coworkers father has a hotel in Hue, and we will be staying there for two days. He is also having some friends take us to a few places for sightseeing. Id like some advice on a thank you gift for his father and friends. 3. Best way to travel from Hoi An to Danang? We were advised to stay in Hoi An over Danang, but I’d like to spend a day or two exploring here. Best way to do about that? 4. Best travel method from Hoi An to Hue. 
 Thank you for any advice, it is appreciated🙏🏻

 Does anyone have any recs on a dual voltage hair dryer and or curling wand that can be used for the 220/240V in Vietnam? I'm heading over from the US and and trying to order one before leaving. Past times, when I've taken a regular dryer and just used a voltage converter, it's rarely worked well. 
 Otherwise, which type of store would one find a dryer/curling wand at in Vietnam? I plan to travel there often so it might be best to purchase one while there.
 Thanks!

Omegle used to work great and it was known I guess in VN but now that it's been shut down, I can't seem to find a good alternative. 
 Ome(dot)tv is a good omegle alternative but Vietnam isn't an option as a country to choose to match with.
 I'm aware of apps like HelloTalk and Tandem (hellotalk requires you to pay to video call but Tandem is free) and I've used them before, but just curious if there was a website that was popular for spontanteous video calls like omegle rather than a language learning app with video call function.
 Any thoughts or other alternative ways to video chat with Vietnamese would be appreciated :)

 Apologies if there is a post about this already somewhere… couldn’t find anything. 
 A year ago I traveled through Vietnam for a month. The friend whom I was traveling with is vegan so we tried out lots of chay places. My mind was blown, it was some of the best food I’ve ever had, specifically the best meat replacements I’ve ever had!!! 
 It was always so juicy, tender, just the right amount of spices and marinated in delicious but not overpowering sauces, so fresh! 
 A year later im still dreaming about this stuff. I decided to google some recipes but I’ve not had much luck. Does anyone have recipe recommendations or can tell me the secret to this magic? 
 Some of it was definitely tofu but I’m not so sure about other ones - maybe seitan? But HOW did they make it so good?? 
 I hope someone knows what I’m talking about. Here are links to the best restaurants I tried, highly recommended! 
 Sa Pa: Hoa Tâm vegetarian restaurant Nhà Hàng Chay Hoa Tâm 
 https://maps.app.goo.gl/dXhy5FENowUgWDTK8?g_st=ic 
 Da Nang: Passionate heart Ẩm Thực Chay Thiện Tâm 
 https://maps.app.goo.gl/ueNm59mArJBHm3xW7?g_st=ic
 Hoi an: Awesome buffet style where you can put together your own meal, went here for breakfast WOW!! Ba Dam Vegetarian Restaurant Quán Chay Đạm ( Bà Đạm vegetarian cafe ) 
 https://maps.app.goo.gl/cC42Tab3TvaPbvz28?g_st=ic
 Da Nang, here we had a kind of fake chicken, the meat replacement (tofu? But not like I’ve ever had it before…) was around a piece of lemongrass, SO much flavor it was incredible!!! : Quan Chay Dieu Hoa - Vegetarian Restaurant

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m travelling to Vietnam for the first time in April (so excited!) and I’m starting the trip in Hanoi. I booked this hotel but now I’m not sure if it’s a real hotel or not. It’s all 3D renderings which a lot of other hotels seem to use, but there’s also no reviews and no website. Booking does say it’s a new hotel though. I also emailed the hotel for photos but she said they’re waiting to get them processed. 
 The hotel is called La Belle Maison Located at 55 Phố Cầu Gỗ, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi above the Circle K. Has anyone seen it or know of this hotel? Am I getting scammed? 
 Thanks in advance!

 We are a brand-new rock band out of Miami Beach, Florida. Our studio album features members of Pearl Jam, Agent Fresco, and New Found Glory. We are excited to start our tour in the Summer of 2024 and are looking at potential destinations.
 We are trying to find cool venues, something like an old church or an old theater, with seating capacity from 50-150 guests. An old abandoned building, barn, field, or cemetery would also be cool, if available. We’d like to make a documentary about the tour, so we prefer cinematic places over traditional rock clubs.
 It's hard to do this kind of search on google, so I figured it's best to ask here, since I will be doing the majority of planning for the tour.
 One last thing, if you guys have any recs on local poster artists, please tag their IG's or names. Food and off-the-beaten track sites are also much appreciated. Especially places pertaining to local music history.
 Hope to hear some great suggestions, and thank you in advance,
 Raven and the Dark Shadows

 Wanted to share not one, not two, but three separate positive actions I witnessed yesterday. They all happened within 40minutes of each other. 
 I was walking to the McDonald’s in Dakao and noticed a few homeless folks sitting on the side of the road. 
 As I was walking by a homeless lady, a scooter with two young women on it, pulled over and handed the homeless lady a red bag, which they pulled out of a box. I watched as they went up the street and gave another homeless man a red bag gift as well. 
 Less than 1 min later, another bike pulled up, and they handed a food box and bottle of water to the homeless lady. 
 This I was able to capture on video. 
 I was astounded by these selfless acts of positivity. 
 Wife and I got to McDonald’s, had dinner, and were walking back the same road, and saw a 3rd person, handing out red pockets to these same homeless folks. 
 I was shocked. 3 selfless acts, not even looking for praise, all within 30minutes. 
 I hope this warms your hearts and gives you hope that Vietnamese society has its positive side. 
 As Mr Rogers said, look for the helpers.

 In China people use TaoBao/Iddle. 
 I really would like if you guys could hook me up with equivalent sites as these but for Vietnam! Please do not recommend sites that are comparable to AMAZON, Target, walmart. Only second hand. Thank you <3

 I'm planning a 2 week trip to visit Vietnam and Cambodia and would appreciate some advice on the Ba Na Hills and surrounding area. Are they worth visiting? Views look great but there doesn't seem to be much else around apart from that French village which looks a bit like a tourist trap. Given we are a bit tight for days, we were thinking about cutting it out. Would be great to have a second opinion :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 In April my boyfriend and I are travelling around Vietnam (specifically, south to north). We are planning on going to Halong Bay towards the end. We will be doing HCMC, Hoi An, Hue, then I was initially thinking Hanoi for 1 night in order to get the transfer to Halong for the cruise. Then after the cruise, three nights in Hanoi to further explore properly before flying home. But the transfer to Halong from hanoi seems quite long, and as we will be returning after the cruise anyway, would it make more sense to stay nearer Halong Bay port for the night before the cruise? That way we only have to do one leg of the three hour transfer (way home). Can't find a lot of into about this, what part of halong city area or nearby is best to stay? even a 30 min transfer is better than 3 hours. 
 Thanks

The Ha Binh Dam was producing so much Energy that it was, for the time, much more economical and faster to build power line to connect it to the south than it is to build a new Dam.
 Most of the construction was done by manual labors with minimal heavy machinery like mixing concrete and pulling the cable by hands. 3.The original plan was to sell the excess power to China, take the payment and give it to the Soviet and then the Soviet will build a new Dam in a 5 years time frame (so ridiculously convoluted to me but idk).
  
So what I looking for are verification on those claim and maybe some sources for deeper research on my part. Thanks in advance to anyone who have the time for this weird question of mine lol.

 Our company plans to expand into Vietnam (specifically, in HCMC and Hanoi) by finding franchisees, and I'm hoping to get some on-the-ground thoughts regarding the idea!
 More specifically, I'd love to know if anyone has tips/leads regarding the following:
  
If anyone has heard of any successful multi-brand franchisees (or companies that own multiple franchisees) that have some experience in the education industry
 
Avenues to find more potential franchise partners 
 
General advice from anyone who has set up a franchise of any industry in Vietnam before 
 
Personal connections who may be interested in such franchise ventures
 
 ​
 Thank you!

 Vietnamese friends in Europe invited me to celebrate Tet with them and I want to give out some Li Xi money especially to the children which there will be plenty of :)
 Our smallest banknote is 5€, equivalent to about 130K VND. My question is, is it okay to give coins in the envelope (1€-2€), or would that be considered rude or offensive? 
 Any Vietnamese people in Europe who can help me with this question?

After that, Tam ordered people in the palace to make Cam become fish sauce and Tam gave that fish sauce to Cam's mother. Cam's mother found it was delicious so she asked Tam how to make such delicious fish sauce. Tam replied: This fish sauce is made from Cam's body. Cam's mother was so shocked that she died.

 Similarly to Christmas in the west, Tet is the coming-home, and loving and celebration holidays for Vietnamese. It's the occasion for people to forgive, to care, and to be gerenous. And loud music! 😀
  
Most people go to their hometowns during Tet. Not being able to meet the parents during Tet is unfortunate and sad.
 
Businesses closed during Tet, except for hotels and some restaurants. People aren't supposed to work during Tet. Restaurants apply 10-30% surcharge during this time, as they have to pay 3x the wages to the workers working during Tet. So if you have to pay 30% more (for food, taxi, services...) than usual price, don't think they rob you…]]></summary>

 The cars that made in Vietnam with a logo Toyota can be anything but competitive, and have been being sold all over the country really well for a long time.
 I guess the reason lies in the unique feature of some Vietnamese called "sính ngoại", which also manipulates them to gain enormous toxicity and hatred towards some other Vietnamese brands like "Heo ăn chuối" and "Bphone"? 🤨🤨🤨

 I lived and taught English in Hanoi from late November 2019 - June 2021. Due to COVID and other circumstances, I had to leave the country in an abrupt fashion and didn't have the time to think of getting a police check certificate while rushing to tie up all other loose ends etc.
 I now live back in the UK (I'm an English national) and have been accepted on to a teacher training course in the UK, but to get on the course I have to provide overseas police checks from countries I have lived in in the last 10 years - so I need one from Vietnam.
 From what I've researched it seems like it might be pretty much impossible to do this process from overseas, but I was wanting to come back to SE Asia before starting my course to visit some friends/travel a bit anyway, so I can get back in-count…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for long/ignorant post, but could someone break the TRC down for me simply? My wife is Vietnamese, and we are recently married. We've been using approved agents for all the different processes required for my transition to Vietnam. I'll be picking up my TRC tomorrow from the agent but this is a picture they sent letting me know it's ready. I'll be asking the agent these questions as well but I figured I'd ask here too.
  
Is this correct TRC for a spouse? When we first started the process the agent kept suggesting another type of visa or TRC that required me to leave every six months or something. I don't know why, we explained that we are married and I will be living in VN. I think we communicated this clearly but sometimes communication is difficult, my Vietnamese is limited, my wife speaks English but sometimes things get lost in translation. 
 
Is the TRC linked to a Visa or IS the TRC the visa? I came on a 90 day evisa at the beginning of January, so I still have until 4 April left on it, but now that I have a TRC has it been changed automatically? Do I have to do anything in that regard? 
 
Do I need to leave and re-enter VN to "activate" it? I read somewhere that once approved and the TRC was received that the person had to leave and re-enter to "change over their visa". I asked the agent about this and they assured me that I DO NOT need to do this or go anywhere, which surprised me.
 
 Anyways, thanks for any insight you can offer, it can be confusing at times as I'm aware that polices can change often, dealing with bureaucracy can be tedious and middlemen aren't always very clear.

The man fled as I arrived and there was a completely unconscious lady on the floor. She eventually came to and another lady took her away i’m guessing to a hospital. Is there anything I can do to help? Would the police actually do anything? I didn’t really see what he looked like.

Ngl I was expecting some kind of grandma candy like taffy or sesame candy (equivalent to butterscotch and strawberry bons bons imo lol) but I was pleasantly surprised to find these mango gummies. Man, these are so addicting.
 Is this Vietnamese brand? I never seen these before and I didn’t see any Vietnamese text on the packaging. As a gummy connoisseur, I rank it better than the classic cocoaland mango gummies and dare I say better than kasugai. So sweet and juicy. Too bad I can’t find it anywhere on Amazon or local Asian/Viet markets 🥲

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this isn't the proper place to ask this. I posted it in the TEFL forum but it didn't work.
 I just obtained a local police background check from the Sheriff's Department in my home county. Will the Vietnamese Government accept my county-level background check and approve my visa, or is a state-level background required? I have heard so much conflicting information from sources online, and some sources told me only an FBI check is acceptable, but others said a local background check is sufficient.
 My biggest issue is time, since it has taken 6 months for my university to send me a hardcopy of my degree, and I wouldn't want to have to wait around much longer for an in-depth background check if this local background check I have already obtained will be accepted. So I would like to know your experiences.
 I'm from the state of Florida, and the background check is for my home county here in Florida. My current plan is to go to VN under a 90 day tourist visa and search for jobs in-country. Thanks and please let me know if I can help clarify anything.

Tất nhiên là tết thì ai cũng muốn vui nên mình chỉ gọi báo khi họ không dừng lại sau 10h tối, gọi báo cái 10 phút sau dân phòng tới dẹp liền.
  
In case you wonder what is this all about, there is a hotline 1022 (not sure if they even support English), you can call the hotline and report any too loud activity (karaoke for example), just need to state the address.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been here for 5 years and this is no longer a "culture" or an "experience". This is essentially the nature of Vietnamese mindset, and it stems from selfishness & "me first" mentality, how many more generations until we stop acting like cavemen?
  
I can sway to the left or right lane without looking because I expect you to.
 I don't have to stop and check while exiting from smaller roads simply because I expect you to.
 I don't have to lower my karaoke volume because i expect you to cover your ears or simply bear with it.
 I litter because i expect you to clean up after me.
 I don't have to wait for others to exit the elevator before entering because i expect you to move aside even though it makes no sense.
 I honk not because i'm alerting you, but simply because i expect you to obey and get out of my way.
 I don't have to lineup simply because I'm older than you.
  
A selfish act makes sense if it actually benefits you to a sizeable amount. But in reality, these actions just make things worse for all parties (For example: how do you enter a fully occupied elevator if you don't give way to people exiting first? And how much time do you actually save from litering?). Feel free to add on but don't give me that "leave if you don't like it" or "other countries are the same" bs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnamese American here. Does anyone else's parents compare them to their friends kids? It almost feels like they wish I was something I'm not or wish they could trade me for someone else. At some point in your life, you have to decide whether you want to live on your own terms or live on your parents terms. The latter will destroy every bit of your sanity and make you lose sight of what truly makes you happy. It is completely okay to disappoint your parents and go against the grain of what traditions they believe to be true. I truly appreciate everything they have done for me, but the unrealistic expectations they have set out for me will unfortunately never be met, and if they ever do get met, it won't be on their terms. The unfortunate truth is you won't be able to please everybody in your life, not even your own family, so the best thing you can do is to live for yourself. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I (25M) will undertake a 3-4 week trip to Vietam this March/April. I've never been, but based on other travellers' experiences, I put together a plan. 
 What I gathered in reading about Vietnam is that it is a large country with lots to do, and that it might be advisable not to rush things and instead come back a second time. That is why I did not pack soo many things on the list. But let me know what you think, and what your experiences were.
 Thank you!
 ​
 The plan:
 2 nights Hanoi
 1 night Trip to Ha Niang (sleeper bus)
 3 nights/4 days Ha Niang Loop
 1 more night Ha Niang, then going to Sapa
 2 nights Sapa Trekking
 1 night Hanoi
 1 night Tam Coc
 2 nights Hoi An
 6 nights Quy Nhon (beach time)
 1 or 2 nights Ho Chi Minh

Car decides he’s a motorbike and goes into the other lane, squeezing the spot for motorbikes down to one motorbike width. Of course there were 2 cunts on motorbikes going the wrong way on the street so we had to stop and look at each other until the car got through. The car wasn’t turning, it just decided it couldn’t sit behind other cars. 
 This is happening more and more the past couple years and I’m thinking of getting a spark plug just to tag the cars.

 My friend and I are planning a trip to Vietnam and are really interested in taking the SE7 train from Hanoi to Ninh Binh and the SE8 train back the following day. However, the website won't let us book just the Hanoi-Ninh Binh section, saying the seats are only for "longer journeys".
 Could we purchase tickets for the SE7 Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh City (available) and the return SE8 Da Nang-Hanoi (also available), and then just get off and on the train at Ninh Binh? Would this be considered a valid ticket or could we cause trouble?
 Any advice from experienced Vietnam train travelers would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

 Note: you can set the Grap app to pick up at Hue Arrival terminal, but what I experience today seem alittle unusual...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to travel on the Laman Express train from Hanoi to Sa Pa. It looks like you can either share a cabin with 4 beds or book a VIP cabin with 2 beds. I want to travel in one of the VIP cabins alone but I noticed on one of the booking sites it says: "VIP cabin must be bought in whole. Single person who travels on VIP cabin must buy both tickets."
 But I don't see an option to book 2 tickets for one person, just one ticket for $76. If I buy that single ticket will I be alright or are they going to charge me for an extra ticket when I arrive?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have decided to travel from Da Nang to Hoi A tomorrow using a Grab car because it costs just under $15 for a one-way trip, which seems like a great deal. My plan is to stay in Hoi A for 2 or 3 nights and then return to Da Nang city on the 8th or 9th, which coincides with the start of Tet. I am a bit concerned that it might be challenging to find available cars for the return trip to Da Nang during that time, or there might be a significant surcharge on Grab cars on the 8th or 9th. Does anyone have insights on what it might be like and any suggestions? Thank you so much.

 I have been travelling from North to South Vietnam and have timed it so I will be in Ho Chi Minh for Tet (I'll be there from 8th to 11th) because I thought it would be a cool place to celebrate the holiday. 
 However, most of the people I've talked to have all said that the city goes dead over the holiday as most businesses shut and local people go home to visit family. 
 So, is it worth visiting over the holiday? What are the celebrations that happen? Or would it be better to move onto my next country (Malaysia) earlier than planned so there won't be much to do in Ho Chi Minh? 
 Thanks

It is a framed picture with some text written on it, according to him and also according to Google Translate it writes "wish fulfilment".

Could somebody help me with figuring out, whether it should be hung on vertical or horizontal orientation?

My sister and mom and I saw so many women wearing really pretty Ao Dais and we decided to buy our own. They came without the pants so we decided to wear long black wide leg dress pants as a substitute. 
 This Friday I’m going to California adventure to attend the lunar new year festival (I’m a pass holder and I want to try the drinks and food pass they have). I want to wear the ao dais to the festival inside the theme park but I’m scared of appropriating or offending Vietnamese culture. 
 I’ve also read and learned how the dress is respectful for Vietnamese women, and that the dress suits the slender body of many Vietnamese women. I’m Filipino and we have our own traditional clothing but we don’t really participate in lunar new year. 
 I’d love any insight or opinions and if there’s a line I’m crossing I’ll keep my ao dai for my personal collection to have. Thank you!

 Looking for advice on what else we can do after being robbed?
 In the overnight sleeping cabin from Hanoi to Hue, someone has entered our cabin, gone through our taken my partners phone, ID and bank cards.
 The phone is tracable and responding via find my phone, but is still in Hanoi and we are in Hue. 
 Whilst we've cancelled everything, locked the phone and reported this to the police, we've been told we have to wait for them to assign it to the right department and then we'll be contacted regarding the phones location. No timeframes were given.
 I'm concerned the phone may go flat, and stop responding. Is there anything else we can do?
 UPDATE: Answering the most common questions. We are on a tour group, the trip leader was expecting a 4th person to use one if the bunks and left the door unlocked. 
 The person who took it left his bag and ticket behind, we suspect it was a local who found an empty bed, went through our stuff and was spooked when my partner woke up. So we are hopeful given we have his stuff and name, the police will do something. 
 We have access to our money as there are 2 of us travelling

We get alot of all kinds of deductions from our salary and our papers are also not returned back once we decided to quit which allowed them to abuse us. The people in the management also told us that they have connections with the immigration which makes all of us scared to do anything. The best we can do is leave but then we don't have any papers to show to the new company. Do you have any idea how to deal with this. Thanks alot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can someone explain this mentality to me?
 I use a Xiaomi because frankly I keep dropping my phones. My last iPhone was an iPhone 6. I had to replace its screen after 2 months. So I was so OVER IT and swore I'd never spend more than $300 on any phone ever again. 
 I do international business. No business people anywhere ever remarked on my phone model. I think they simply do not give a crap. However, Ik lower income folks definitely do judge me for it. 
 For instance, Ik a guy who follows me around asking me for a job. Ik his financial situation is quite dire since he's a new graduate who's never had a job that pays more than 10M VND/month. Yet somehow he bought a new iPad that's worth 6 months of rent. He'd keep making hater comments to me, despite begging me for a job btw. He once implied I faked a business trip by posting Google photos (I took the photos myself).
 Another relative of mine kept complaining about her low paying job. Yet when I bought my Xiaomi, she made this snide comment to the effect of "Oh yea you don't need to buy good phone." She exclusively uses iPhone.
 I have 2 iPads that were given to me by my in laws that I never use because I frankly think they're useless. I can't write, can't draw, can't play games, can't read, can't do anything except watch Youtube. My inlaws are also not rich. Yet they like to collect these Apple items which they never use. These items are practically just worthless junks that clutter the house. I simply do not get it. I'd prefer to have my money in things that appreciate in value.
 What's the secret formula of Apple marketing that taps into these people's psyche?

 ​
 The problem is that I'm planning on staying for one week. During the visa application, I wrote that I'll be there for 6 days. I now realized that I need to stay for an extra day, 7 days in total.
 ​
 I'm not seeing anywhere how long I am allowed to stay in Vietnam, it does state 'length of stay is subject to permission by immigration authority' and the date of expiry is 26/10/2030.
 ​
 Is there a way to stay an extra day, should I ask at the immigration desk in Vietnam, or should I re-apply for another e-visa?
 ​
 Thanks

 I'm really confused, what are the current regulations for householding in Vietnam as a foreigner?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We get invited quite often to Vietnamese catholic mass and the potlucks that the vietnamese community has very often, but are always told to not bring anything and to just enjoy the food (which is always delicious btw!). This year for Lunar New Year, we've once again been invited to mass and their celebration afterwards. Last year, I made tamales since I'm mexican to share, and although they were well received, I did notice that a lot of people were hesitant to try them. I'm thinking of going a more of an asian route this time, would spicy soy sauce marinated eggs with onions, sesame seeds, chives, garlic etc. be an appropriate dish to bring to compliment other rice dishes or should I try my hand at something else? I feel confident in this side dish in that I make it very often. I know I will be welcomed regardless if I don't bring anything, but I would feel more comfortable bringing something that is familiar that would be eaten vs trying to make another mexican dish that may not be eaten. The community is more on the elderly side, with younger couples in their 40s if that helps.
 Any suggestions are appreciated.

Quite the opposite. I was even a bit positively surprised at how safe and well organised everything is, given that the country was completely destroyed and had absolutely no development 50 years ago I would say your country has done an excellent job at building something from next to nothing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: GF received harassing texts in zalo from a person who said they live nearby and knows where her room is. Find Nearby is enabled so we can't dismiss it as just a random text. Where to report? What should we do?
 Hey all, long post ahead, hoping to find help. My GF (23F), recently moved in to a new dorm and received a zalo text (first 2 messages) out of nowhere.
 I suggested to accept the so we can get the zalo number because I was suspecting it could be related to another incident (of a harassing grab driver, but that is another story). I wanted to check if it could be the same guy, but I didn't realize that would mean she the person will be notified.
 At this point my gf has started panicking and reached out to her landlord to ask if they gave her number to anyone, and also to seek for assistance. But they only told her to lock her doors and not to open if she hears a knock on her door. And that if she gets harassed, to call them so they can help. We asked if there's a way to report this, they said no and this makes me feel really worried.
 She blocked the number and disengaged. I read that it's advisable to send a warning message to the harasser before blocking, but I'm worried this could even trigger them to act on their ill intent. The landlord's advice doesn't help either, she would still need to go out and walk around the area, and the person supposedly lives near. We can't just sit still until something happens. Unfortunately my gf only found out after that there is a find nearby in zalo so we cannot be sure if this is a random harassing text, but the fact they refer to it as 'room' makes me think they could indeed be living nearby.
 I live overseas, and im really worried about her safety. My GF is also an international and is not familiar on how to navigate things like this in Vietnam.
 Would going to the police help or do they dismiss reports like this?
 Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

Some people even complain that students in Vietnam study way less than in China, South Korea, therefore students should not complain about the current system being too hard, saying the countries mentioned above got better economy and more "prodigies" thanks to East Asian education. But they barely see the fact that both China and SK got rich thanks to the technology transfer from the west while Vietnam has little to none. China and SK education have pressure too, and their students are only mostly good on paper. Should Vietnam follow the East Asian model, or pursue a different path with proper reforms ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically every day we go for a walk some Vietnamese person starts to yell at us, saying our dog is shitting on the street by their house, or whatever. Funny thing is that we are the only people in the area that actually walk our dog on a leash, and we carry bags to pick up our dog's shit, you know, like educated members of any normal society. We even explain this to people, but their too fucking stupid to care.
 It's not even the same person, it's like everyday some idiot feels the urge to yell at us or start jumping and rushing our dog to scare it. Side note: our young dog was abused by Vietnamese people (and small children) and left alone and sick in the street as a puppy and does not like being approached like that. 
 Our dog wasn't doing anything tonight and some woman started berating us and saying she'd call the police because she assumed we were making our dog shit on the side walk. She was full blown psychotic and her fucking 6-7 year old kid was just standing there watching his mother act like a wild animal. For a society that hates being called dogs, a lot of people in my area don't deserve to be called a dog, as that would be giving them a compliment. End rant, sorry this shits, pun intended, been pissing me off for so long.

U cannot enter or leave Ha Giang without getting controlled, we also got controlled at 11pm in ha giang and 6.30am a few Km away! If you don't want to pay that fine, get a bus to Don Vang and rent a bike from there. U will get the best views of the whole loop and there is no police checks at all! Its just around Ha Giang!! I hope I could help some people:)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear people of color 
 My post is based on multiple trips to multiple cities in Vietnam 
 I have to warn you that if you are solo traveling through Vietnam and you have a dark skin,in my experience when you come to Saigon and Hoi An expect to be ostracised by many of the service staff in the tourist friendly restuarants and shops in these places .
 In these two cities you will be treated with disdain by large proportions of tourist service staff who are very clear in their distaste at serving you . The complete difference in the way dark skinned people are ostracised and white skinned tourists were fawned over in the same place by the same staff is the most consistently racist experience I have had in my travels to 30 different countries . 
 In other accounts on Reddit people have spoken of how they spent their entire holidays in their hotel room to avoid such unpleasant ostracisation 
 However in Hanoi and Danang and Dalat I have received much more kindness from ordinary Vietnamese so I suspect this overt dark skin ostracism is a phenomenon localized to certain parts of Vietnam . 
 Of course looking at the tons of posts on this topic ,I assume people will offer tons of reasons for discrimination.and they would suggest you suck it up . You don't have to listen to those kind white skinned people on this forum who assure you the Vietnamese can't be racist bcos they fawn over white skinned people like gods .
 If you are a POC i don't think you need to waste your hard earned cash to be ostracised 
 I suggest if you do come to Vietnam in my experience I found in Danang or Hanoi or Dalat the people don't appear so ready to ostracise customers with dark skin
 Or if you prefer less ostracism with your coffee go to Thailand or Laos where they don't openly ostracise innocent strangers for the color of their skin

 I’m white. It sounds like his dad might be a little disappointed about it. I think the concern is that I won’t be able to relate to or keep the culture going like an Asian woman would.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This afternoon my family and I all went to the Hoi Anh Impressions theme park and it was good, but also a bit confusing with some features like a Doraemon sandpit, a maze that seemed to resemble a POW camp, and a “sweet land” area that was cut off from the rest.
 But the thing that left my partner and I wondering the most is:
 At the theme park there are set times where mini artistic performances are given, usually one after the other. After finishing viewing a juggling/circus performance outside a building in the Chinese village, the guide said that people were invited inside for an additional show, requiring a separate ticket, called “the beauties” and that this show was only able to be viewed by people over the age of 18.
 We have two very small children so didn’t go, but my partner and I spent a lot of time wondering what would make a show at a theme park like this adults only? Some ideas we had
  
it may involve offering guests shots of alcohol. But we’ve been to shows like this before with kids- they just don’t give the kids alcohol
 
maybe it involves playing games with the “beauties” which may be leaning towards gambling
 
there may be some jokes or references which aren’t suitable for children. But I would expect references would have to be pretty mature to only be suitable for 18 year olds instead of say 16 year olds. 
 
someone is getting naked. Which would be odd for a theme park, but a 18+ show in a theme park is already pretty weird. 
 
 So, anyone has any clue of what was making this an adult only production? 
 Tl:dr- an otherwise family friendly theme park in Hoi Anh has an adult only show- curious as to what makes it 18+

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the north of the island is an artificial town that resembles Venice. It's called grand world. People could buy houses there, but no land, as this was a whole residential project. Since a few days nobody is allowed to go into the area anymore. Also the homeowners. There's police and people are protesting and even fighting, as I heard. I've heard two versions went this is happening. 1 there's a new project, so people need to go 2 the owner of the land wants something.
 I'm sure that this is not 100 percent accurate, as I don't live in grand world, so it's just what people are talking, but pretty serious.
 Seems like It's not a good idea to buy single apartments or houses without land.

They aren’t painful or itchy so I have no idea what they could be from. The only bugs I noticed in our Airbnb were what I think are plaster bugworms. It’s pretty warm weather right now so that could be a factor. It’s also not acne or anything like that. When I visited in 2019, I had this issue but there were fire ants in the hotel so I figured that was where they came from. Anyone know what might be the cause?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m learning Vietnamese and I’m at the stage where I’m finding out that there are a lot of words that repeat and change meaning when making compound words. (Idk if they’re really called compound words so I’ll give u an example) :
 Example: hàng (google translate: “row”?? Wtf) 1. Nhà hàng - restaurant 2. Ngân hàng - bank 3. Họ hàng - relative 4. Hàng này - this item 
 Actually I didn’t come here to complain. Well, partially to complain but mostly to ask if any vietnamse learners have useful resources/lists of vocab words like this. 
 Another (simpler) example is máy (machine). In that case the meaning doesn’t change as drastically. 
 Also useful would be lists of words that are “spelled” the same but have different tones. Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: Booked a ha long bay cruise at an office in Ha Noi, got scammed, now he threatened to send someone after me and said that I should never come back to VN after canceling it.
 
 Yesterday I tried to book a 2d1n Ha Long Bay tour for the next day through an office for my family. 
 He showed me only one option and said this is a 5 star cruise, and if I’m not happy with the cruise he will fully refund me.
 After I felt a bit off about the tour, so I did some digging and almost all the sources online said this is a 4 star cruise and the reviews are terrible. (I did mentioned that prior to the booking but he kept on reassuring me that it is fine) but my gut instinct said I should cancel so I did. He won’t let me cancel, tried to call me multiple times but I insisted and he confirmed it. (I did try to rebook with another cruise that I like but his price were 1m higher than what he told us)
 The morning after (today) I found a lot of bad review on Google which confirmed my suspicions. And then I got the call from the driver to come and pick us up which I find kinda weird since I already canceled it, he then call me multiple times, then told someone else to call me and beg me to go on the cruise.
 He then continued to threaten me saying that he will send someone to collect the rest of the money, and said that I should never come back to Vietnam. 
 Question: What should I do? I did tried to contact the embassy. They told me to contact the local police but will they really help? The other review was a year ago.

I felt really heartbroken seeing these kids walking around and begging when they really should be playing at this age or be in kindergarden. Eventually I gave them a little money and they bought a snack. Now a friend of mine told me, that it is not advisable to give them money as this is an organized business and they are trained to do so and this behavior shouldn’t be encouraged . Is this the case with every of these street kids?

We let these old people treat us like dirt and expect us to show them respect as if they’re some sort of god, this is why I hate family gatherings and events. The only reason I’m holding back is because I know my parents dont want a tarnished relationship. 
 I swear the attitude, ignorant and straight up spiteful things they say and do irks me to my core, this is why I live far from them for my mental health.

So my fellow vietnamese, has anyone successfully investing outside? If you’ve done it, how to do so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dad was originally from Soc Trang in the south and during the Vietnamese-American war, he left as a boat person and ended up in Thailand for a few years before finally ending up in the US. I was born in the US as a Viet Kieu. However I do not speak or know anything about Vietnamese culture (I grew up with a Chinese background since that’s where my mother was from). My Mom and Dad split up when I was about 10. 
 Fast forward 15 years. My dad has passed away and I deeply regret not learning more of my Vietnamese side. I want to go to Vietnam to do some self exploration and see where he was from. He had a massive family in Vietnam that he always spoke on the phone with but I never partook because I don’t know the language nor did I know them. 
 I want to see if I can find them but chances may be slim. What do you guys think are the chances I can find the if I have his picture, his name, his date of birth, and knowing he’s from Soc Trang? 
 I don’t know any of my relatives names but I assume they have the same last name as me. I’ve seen a picture of his brothers and they all look pretty much exactly like my dad so I can probably facially recognize them. But how would I go about searching for them in the first place? Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I've been lurking in the server for quite a long time now, reading posts about home and recently some posts about people going back home or studying in the US. I (22M) myself is an international student too, and I have just graduated college last year, studying animation. However, due to circumstances, from my own lack of research into the animation field in the US, lack of extreme effort to be stellar and stand out in the field, lack of connections, and the industry's terrible crash at the moment if you are in the knows, I haven't been lucky in getting a job and an H1B visa for further employment. I've been working on unpaid internships and volunteer work that aligns with my field of study and approved by my school to stay in the US since then. It has been really hard.

 I (29,m) am a German citizen, with Vietnamese parents, who has been to Vietnam a total of 5 times. 
 And to me it is safe to say, that the majority of my parents' generation (born around 1960) suffered from PTSD and is still doing so. 
 Because of course you are traumatized as a child in a warzone. 
 And because your PTSD is never diagnosed or treated, you keep your unhealthy patterns and pass them down to your children.

I'm staying in the 8th floor of a hotel and I hear it literally all day/night. They go until 2am sometimes. Not only is it loud, but the FREQUENCY at which it is coming out of the speakers is enough to drive someone mad. Is it just me, or are locals not bothered by this at all?

 My understanding is that when you purchase a bike you receive the Blue Card for the vehicle. This can't be registered to foreigners but it's not really enforced/doesn't matter (correct me if I'm wrong).
 Does anyone know how collision/liability insurance works and where to get it? I've heard mandatory insurance is available at gas stations and is affordable. But say worst case scenario, I hit and injure a pedestrian or other driver... What happens? What do most foreigners sign up for for this scenario?
 Currently renting but thinking of purchasing. Any help is great. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 well, i don’t know where to write this, so im doing it here. I’m a French boy, and I met a Vietnamese girl 3 months ago. We were talking every week and almost everyday. She is an active viet girl who do a lot of sports but recently, she stopped doing ice skating because her health kinda declined in few weeks at the beginning of 2024. She showed me that her Apple Watch detected 2 times AFib. I told her to see a doctor but she didn’t because she was waiting for her new ID card. 
 In the night Saturday night of this weekend. Her father was apparently drunk and her parents was arguing kinda violently as she told me. She said that she was kinda scared. I had to go on Paris at the same time, I told her to try to calm down and all. And I moved out of my house. The next day I sent a message to see if everything was alright but she didn’t responded or saw my message. I sent few messages to her on Discord or iMessage to ask if she was safe, but no response. I have her Apple health informations in real time on my iPhone, yesterday she walked only 90 meters and only 550 meters on Sunday. She apparently doesn’t wear her Apple Watch since 3 days :/ So I can’t see her heart informations. 
 I’m worried that anything happened to her. Btw she’s an online student, so if she was studying, I would see her at least online on discord. 
 What can I do ? Help! 
 I’m sorry for my English, it’s not my mother language.
 If it’s not the right subreddit, I’m sorry, it’s my firsts times on Reddit 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't understand why a lot of people here like alcohol so much. I feel sick when drinking alcohol; your head goes numb, sometimes leading to a bad headache. You cannot drive any vehicle, and your stomach gets twisted and turns upside down. It's really bad for your health. Most of the stuff people drink is low quality, and the container for the drink is literally a gasoline can.
 With close family, I can get away with drinking less, but in the workplace, there is a lot of pressure to drink. It's considered very disrespectful if you decline a drink offer or if you don't offer a drink to an elder/senior. You will be considered the outcast, the weirdo of society; you have to drink to earn a little respect. I hate that the cons of not drinking outweigh the cons of drinking even it can lead to greater danger to life.
 I understand the experience of sharing good food or singing karaoke, partying with people, but why do you need alcohol? After being drunk, I make no progress at work or for myself; I'm just stuck in bed, wasting my life. Maybe I am a big snowflake, but alcohol, to me, is the devil's drink, and I still don't get it. Sorry if this post is too much ranting from me.
 What is your experience with drinking in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hanoi/Halong Itinerary with young kids and elderly
 Hi All, I cannot find the answer anywhere after scouring the internet…
 We have some elderly and some toddlers on this trip to Vietnam coming up. One of the elders speaks Vietnamese so hopefully we can get by OK. But I gotta do all planning. My questions regarding this trip:
 1) We plan for 3 nights in Hanoi area with a Halong Bay cruise and Ninh Binh (maybe?) tour. I’ve read anything from just booking onsite with hotel to planning ahead online and avoiding scams. What to do with the large family group like this? 
 2) Overnight or day cruise to Halong Bay with kids and 80 yr olds? I imagine we will stay in Hanoi on the first night and head out to Halong the next morning. However, I am reading a lot about these tour operators who extend the drive from Hanoi to about 3 hrs by stopping by some random vendors like pearl shops. Don’t want to do this with kids if we can cut down drive time to about 2 hrs. I also don’t love the idea of staying overnight in a boat but it might be less tiring than a roundtrip drive in one day. 
 3) Do you book your stay in Hanoi and come back to the same hotel after Halong cruise (ie if you’re doing an overnight) or do you lug all your stuff with you?
 4) Ninh Binh doable with really young kids in this time span? I realize the trip is super short though I hear it’s worth visiting. 
 5) We are headed to Nha Trang after Halong Bay (or Ninh Binh). Ideally Halong Bay > Haiphong airport is a shorter route to get to Nha Trang airport so we don’t have to go all the way back to Hanoi. But it seems only Vietjet operates direct flights at this airport whereas we prefer VN airlines where Hanoi would have flights. Wondering if I should consider the smaller airport close to Halong to avoid the round trip drive back to Hanoi. 
 6) Any other suggestions with little kids such as just hiring a private driver/shuttle vs tour groups. 
 Thanks!!!

 the usual precautions were observed: checking for fake bezels, hidden cameras, keypad overlays, two hands whilst entering pin, etc.
 this was the style of machine with a narrow slot, basically impossible to install a skimmer from the exterior that's undetectable.
 a week later, both cards were flagged by the banks within hours of each other. pin was compromised, as they attempted to transfer funds via world remit, just £1 shy of the balance (along with online purchases).
 either bank employees are in on this, or the company servicing the machines. rogue firmware and/or a physical device internally.
 both cards were virgin since i have no use for them (entire life's apple pay, touch-and-go, octopus, etc.).
 can't really avoid that situation, best to make a few burner accounts with monese, monzo, etc. prior to travel. once your accounts are flagged for fraud, game over.

 Turns out in small print above that, it says to write it as shown on your passport, and the email has come through saying “hello Lewis” Lewis being my middle name and Oliver being my first. 
 Is this going to be a problem? I realize I have made a stupid mistake and I’m sure this happens quite often to foreigners. And ontop of it all I’m going to fucking Singapore, which is notorious for its strict laws. What should I do, are they going to let it slide or is this going to be a problem?
 Serious help is needed 😆

 I have just started to learn Vietnamese :)
 It seems there is some great music here, that I've heard just walking around, so I would love to hear more. 
 My favorite genres are indie/alternative and EDM (especially techno and trance) but I would love recommendations of any genre. 
 I also teach English (Native) and Spanish (C1) on the side, so if anyone is interested in language exchange, please reach out.

 I've been recommended Hoi An as a good place
 What i ideally want is a smaller quieter city, with interesting things to do ( cycling, hikes, day tours, kayaking, etc) Good food options ( emphasis on fresh fruit and veggies and not fried rice and noodles all the time) Affordable cost of living for a rental, groceries and eating out. And security..being able to walk around freely without worry.
 Sounds like a tall order. Does it sound about right, or other places might be better. 
 I would like a place with not too much traffic congestion and the continously honking and motorcycles.
 Thanks

You can be clapped, short and basically physically reprehensible with an unattractive personality but if your pockets are deep, you still get girls. Not that the notion is foreign to me, but I thought Vietnam prioritised hard-work and good ethics as a attractive trait (taken with a grain of salt). A deeper insight on what occurs in the Vietnamese dating scene is appreciated. Thank you!

I prefer squeezed lemon juice which I squeeze myself. While I was there I saw absolutely no yellow lemons. I just saw the green limes. Whenever I asked at a store for lemons they always showed me limes. I showed a picture of yellow lemons and nowhere has them. Does Vietnam just not have lemons anywhere?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all I am travelling to vietnam In three days and haven't really booked much except for about 5 days worth of accom, and will be planning on staying there for 20ish days.
 I will be landing in hanoi, is sapa worth the 12-16 hour detour as I will have to go to sapa then back down to hanoi. Is there any other places like sapa that I would find on my way down to ho chi minh city.
 Otherwise this will be my current itinerary, 3-4 days in (hanoi) > 2 days in (halong Bay) > 2/3 days (phong na) > one day (dong hoi)
  
one day (hue) > 3 days (hoi an) > 1 day (da nang) > 3 days (ho chi minh city) > fly to Thailand. This will be my first trip to asia.
  
I would appreciate any tips, as I am slightly nervous as I haven't traveled much. Thank you

I will be coming off benzodiazepine and I will be going to Southeast Asia to do so, I will be leaving my job for six months and I need somewhere calm(ish), coastal and sunny. Initially thought Vietnam because it’s so affordable, although I don’t think it’s a very easy experience, especially if I’m feeling fragile, I wondered how much more expensive Thailand would be? Does anybody have any comparisons in terms of day-to-day living?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm planning on travelling from Ninh Binh to Hoi An on 8th February 2024 in order to spend Tet in a proper city. As I read some bad reviews about the buses online (bus drivers honking and driving like crazy throughout the night, other passengers sleeping in the corridors, people unexpectedly being dropped off in Da Nang and having to wait an hour for another bus to Hoi An), I'm thinking about either taking a train or going back to Hanoi to take an airplane. As I'm pressed on time, I don't mind spending a little more money for a quicker and safer journey.
 Does anyone of you have experiences with ...? - taking a bus from Ninh Binh to Hoi An - taking a train from Ninh Binh to Da Nang and then taking another means of transport (which?) to Hoi An - taking a bus from Ninh Binh to Hanoi, then taking an airplane to Da Nang, and then taking another means of transport to Hoi An

 Im arriving at 7-8 february , if you have any recommended places or events in Hanoi to experience the TET celebrations will be totally interesting OR if i have to know any traditional customs and rituals associated with TET in Hanoi and if there are there any specific do's and don'ts for travellers during celebrations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Since our time in Vietnam we have found that the locals have been trying to scam us in numerous ways, such as buses not arriving at the actual bus station and dropping us 5km outside of the designated bus stop at 3am where a local taxi driver is waiting. (Charging 500k for a 5km journey) to our hotel, which was beside the actual bus stop we were supposed to be dropped at. 
 Our driver made a call on the way to the hotel and when we arrived the hotel was shut. We have literally discussed our early/ late arrival with the hotel but now they had the door and cover shut. (Like it had been abandoned)
 Luckily our taxi driver, who just happened to know where the bus would drop us, and made a call just before dropping us to the hotel, knew of another hotel. He dropped us to this small dingy homestay where he clearly knew the owner and we paid 700k dong for a disgusting room which was not worth 200k dong.
 When we were in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, obviously you had people trying to make a few extra dollars from you, but never so orchestrated as in Vietnam where there seems to be an actual system in place.
 I am just curious, as an Irish person, I would hate to see this happen to Vietnamese tourists coming to our country and would be sure to voice up for it to stop, nor would our local community.
 What are Vietnamese people's thoughts on this ? Does it bother you or do you all enjoy trying to extract as much money as possible from people visiting your country ?

 Is it common for women to approach guys directly or indirectly in Vietnam? What are the best ways? Please give me advices.
 Edit: I have an idea. Say hi in the elevator. Then bring him homemade food at night.

 I’ll be flying out to Ho Chi Minh at the end of February and staying in Vietnam for 35 days, and then flying to Thailand for 26. I’ll be staying in hostels, hopefully in urban areas and doing activities such as the Hai Giang Loop and Trang Boat Tour etc. nothing crazy like camping/hiking or volunteering. 
 At the moment most places in my local area haven’t got the Japanese Encephalitis in stock and my travel clinic said it’s nothing to worry about based on my itinerary.
 Whilst I trust their opinion and expertise - I would love to ask the general to see if anyone has gone to Vietnam and not had the Japanese vac - in my case, how important is it that I have it? If so, its looking like I’ll be getting the shots over there!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in Vietnam currently and heading to Thailand at the end of February, I just found out for people who are visa exempt with Thailand that immigration can ask to see 20,000 thai baht or another currency to the same amount in cash.
 I didn't plan for this so I need to get money exchanged. It would be easier if I could do this by card payment or bank transfer in a Vietnam bank as I don't want to have to withdraw 15+ million dong from an ATM to take to get exchanged.
 Do Vietnamese banks allow foreigners to exchange currency and if so would this be doable by bank transfer or card payment?

 I understand this place is inherently touristy I don’t want to sound like I’m surprised but I really want to learn and experience Vietnamese culture without being ripped off and underwhelmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and wife collect beer bottle tops from different counties we have been to. Last year in Vietnam we got the tops from red and green bottles of Saigon beer in Hanoi (these tops have red and green dragons on them), but when we had a bottle of 'Saigon Chill' in the south there was no dragon, just a stamp with numbers. We were expecting that this would be a blue dragon. I'm guessing the dragon bottle tops are only in the north.
 I know this sounds silly, but we really want the blue dragon bottle top from Saigon Chill.
 If anyone could get this for us and post it to us in the UK I'd happy pay you £30 for it. If you think you can help can you PM me please?
 By the way, we always try not to bend the bottle top when we take it off. We usually use something like a spoon around the edges to do this.

When I was little, I was told of a Vietnam war but never much of a deal out of it. But as I grow older, it becomes clearer to me that there are still might be many underlying issues and incidents that still occur from the war. From older Vietnamese generations, I often hear that there's still tension 50 years later. Just wanted a more experienced and hopefully objective viewpoint of the matter. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure many of you studied English in school, but was that sufficient to get you to the level you’re at now? For me, school provided a 'logical' understanding of the language. However, I found it challenging to comprehend native speakers because the English taught in textbooks differs significantly from spoken English, and the accents of public school teachers aren’t always perfect.
 Upon finishing school, I struggled to watch videos or movies in English, even though I could somewhat manage reading textbooks - albeit with some effort. There came a point when my favorite show stopped being subtitled in Vietnamese, forcing me to watch it with English subtitles.
 Initially, it was difficult, and I didn’t understand much. But over time, things started to make sense, before I knew it, my YouTube feed had become entirely English - primarily due to the lack of useful content in Vietnamese. The auto subtitle feature of youtube came out around that time so that was super useful too.
 TL;DR: School gave me a foundation in English, but only after watching and reading a lot of English content does it click for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking to apply for a working holiday visa to Vietnam, I would be spending 10 - 12 months there. I’m 27 and from Australia. 
 I have two degrees from an Australian university; Bachelor of Laws & Bachelor of Arts. I have 3 months of work lined up already, and enough savings that I could potentially dedicate 6 months of my time there to volunteering without earning any money. 
 I’ve been in the Scouting movement since I was 8 years old and now I am an adult leader. I have had significant experience volunteering through Scouts. I also spent three years volunteering for a family violence shelter and I have done significant work around support for survivors of sexual violence. 
 Now I am looking into the prospect of volunteering while I am in Vietnam, and I have the time to dedicate myself properly. However, I don’t want to be caught in a scam or do more damage than good. When I search things online, I end up on websites I’m unsure if I can trust. 
 I am looking for any advice people could provide on volunteering in Vietnam ethically, without accidentally contributing to organisations that are doing more harm than good, and without doing harm myself. 
 This isn’t so I can post on social media and paint myself as an amazing person, I don’t even use social media. I genuinely want to spend my time helping people who need it, it’s all I have ever wanted to do. If the answer is that it’s not possible for me to do any good this way then I completely understand that as well. 
 Any advice is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No other country is this cliche with land scams. All the big scams nowadays have the same setup, and it always involves land and some sort of title. Had an uncle today call me up to let me know about his plight with the family land. Needs money or the bank will take it. Also needs some money to smooth out the title. Promises to put the title in my name. 
 If Vietnam wants to evolve into a better society, the scams have to be better.

 So I wanted to ask if there is a vietnamese equavalent meaning a website that ranks vietnamese youtubers based number of subscribers and doesn't just cover the 1000 most popular channels?
 I know this is a long shot but it existed for japanese youtubers why wouldn't possibly exist for vietnamese ones?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys 🫡, this is the first time I've used this function in an app (weirdly???), so I think a lot about the topic that I can discuss with guys. Finally, I wonder why dont i share about schoolwork or daily days. So that reason I'm here. Not rambling more, today I will talk about my ambition of schoolwork. I'm a normal student in my public school which I tried my best to enroll in (it is one of the best in my province). Therefore, when I study there, I try a lot to "catch the life melody". I'm not the type of smart person, the achievement I got is my diligence every single day. In the first year of the class in this school, I studied a lot to be an excellent student (I'm studying a new curriculum, so 9.0 average for 6 subjects to be an excellent student) but I can not. That time, I was so disappointed in myself, because I struggled with studying very much. Fortunately, I learned that studying too much does not mean getting high marks or good results, I have to study effectively, study smarter, and focus on the main lesson/idea in that subject. And u know what, by my efforts and belief in myself, finally the second-year class I got it * That was so amazing!!(^)* I was cheerful when I got praise perk. At that moment, I was so satisfied with my performance academic. Currently, I don't know why but I wanna get higher achievements than now, no longer satisfied with myself. Moreover, I wanna join some activities in school such as dancing, clubs, and more interesting things. As a result, sometimes I burn out, exhausted but I receive new experiences, and worthwhile memories with my friends. 🤔Do you think that when we are young or students we should try our best to achieve the best result? And the ambition like me, is it right?
 Btw, my English is not good, so I hope everyone can sympathize with me😇. Thanks a lot😘

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a motorbike accident some time ago in Vietnam. After the accident a traffic policeman/detective went to the hospital I was in to ask some questions to my Vietnamese coworkers visiting me.
 One of my coworkers told me he wanted to check my messaging history on my phone (I have no idea why). They refused to let him access that.
 After being discharged at the hospital, I went to the police station to meet the other driver I crashed with and fully compensated him for the damages of his car (he didn't suffer any injuries) and we both signed a document to cease any legal case caused by the accident.
 Yesterday I went again to the transit police station to pay for the fines related to the accident while I was driving my motorbike. The policeman gave me a document so I was able to collect back my motorbike after I paid everything. After leaving the police station he texted me on Zalo to ask about the identity card and one more document of one of my coworkers (specifically, the one who refused to show him my chats). Again, I have no idea why he needs that.
 At this point I want to cease any contact with the police since I already compensated the other driver and paid the fines related to the accident.
 Do I have any legal obligation to reply to the policeman who keeps texting me on Zalo? Should I stop replying to his messages and get a lawyer in case they require more documents in the future?
 I'm starting to feel paranoid about the whole situation.
 Any help is appreciated. Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are putting the finishing touches on our North Vietnam itinerary in late March and we're deciding where to spend an extra day: Pu Luong or Cat Ba. We're definitely doing Pu Luong for 1 night and Ha Long Bay for 1 night but not sure where to add the extra night between Pu Luong and Cat Ba. We're also going to Hanoi and Ninh Binh for multiple nights but this the part of the trip where we're undecided still so any advice much would be much appreciated.
 Here are my thoughts: 
  
If we do 1 day in Ha Long Bay, we'll only do a 1 day cruise and skip Cat Ba. If we do 2 days, we'll do 1 day cruise and 1 day Cat Ba and rent a scooter to explore the island. Hearing mixed reviews on this part of the trip so wondering if 1 day cruise is enough. 
 I know this won't be peak time of year for rice fields in Pu Luong but it looks like a beautiful, less touristy area which is appealing since I expect the other locations to be crowded. 1 day will be pretty rushed but also not sure how much there is to see. 
  
I have no idea what to expect in either place outside of some Google images and reddit posts but if anyone has been to both places – especially in this time of year – it would be awesome to get your thoughts.

 Any tips or recommendations would be welcomed!

 4 years ago I did the same but all around the north, bordering China. It was one of the best trips I ever did and I've been almost everywhere in SEA.
 I'm hoping to find some ethnic markets with the typical colorful fabrics and local crafted products sold by the very same people that make them, as I did in the past in Coc Ly Market up north.
 Was also thinking about stopping by in some Hotspring, but nothing high-end, just a nice location and a modest hotspring where that local people may use.
 Any other recommendations for the trip are welcome, I'm mostly interested in nature, local culture, gastronomy, scenic areas and authentic places, I'm not into fancy stuff.
 Thanks Reddit!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! 
 I'm currently in Ho Chi Minh City and I'm about to head up to Buôn Ma Thuot for a couple of days to visit Yok Don National Park. After that it's off to Cambodia! But I don't want to retrace my steps back to Ho Chi Minh in order to do so - I was hoping there'd be a bus that would take me directly over the border. 
 Generally on my trip so far, when there's no advance info about buses online (via 12go/baolau), I just arrive and there'll be some local company advertising the route I need, and it's all good. But I thought I'd ask anyway.
 Ideally I'd like to stop off at Kracheh before heading on to Phnom Penh. Is anyone aware of public/private bus links from Buôn Ma Thuot going across the border and on to either of these places? Or is it inevitable that I have to head back to Saigon first? 
 Thanks! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, we will land at Phnom Penh in the beginning of february, and we want to continue to vietnam and fly back home from Ha Noi at the end of february. So I wonder if it's okay to travel through Vietnam (we'll probably enter between Ho Chi Minh and Phnom Penh) during Tet or it's a completely dumb idea because we might end up stranded? The travel guides are not very clear so what is the actual situation there?
 The other option is to stay in Cambodia until the Tet is over, but then twoo weeks is hardly enough to see Vietnam which we wanted in the first place.
 Thanks for replies, we are looking forward to see your beautiful country!

The most economical and fastest actually seems to be private taxi through 12goasia. So, I was wondering if it made sense to hire a driver who could also function as a guide for our 3d2n trip. If so, I would I go about finding one? (i'd obviously pay for lodging and food for the guide)

I recently had a fall and hurt my foot, which got worse over a few days. I went to hospital today under the advice of my hotel, and they have been nothing short of amazing. The manager came with me to help with translating, waited 2 hrs in hospital with me before going home to her family. One of the bus boys gave me his arm to lean on accompanying me to the taxi and was ready waiting for me when I returned. A third one followed holding an umbrella over my head. All these kind gestures made my experience that much easier, and I wanted to thank them. I'd love to leave them separate tips, without digging too deep in my budget but without offending them either ... What do you think is a good sum to tip in this situation? Thank you in advance for your insights!

 Looking for:
  
a smaller city or perhaps a town
 a vibrant exciting atmosphere - somewhere with a great vibe where everyone really gets into the lunar new year spirit
 somewhere with relatively fresh air and nature nearby
 somewhere in southern or central Vietnam
  
Thanks in advance!

I received the whole Rosetta Stone courses last year for free as a gift so I'm thinking I might as well get started into the SEA region and am looking at Vietnamese as the starting point. That said I ask would it help in learning Khmer and other Austroasiatic languages across the regions among the plenty of regional peoples and ethnicities outside the dominant cultures and nations of the Indochina region? Would it help learn languages of nearby countries that use languages from different families and not considered as within Indochina like Thai and Burmese? Just to be specific so I don't forget about it, would it help with Lao (as Laos is part of Indochina but its language is from a different family, the Kra–Dai which Thai is also a member of)?

However, the hotel where I am staying is saying that they can provide pick up from the train station for 700k which I find really expensive. I am aware that the train station is at least 45 minutes away but I have never paid a taxi that much since the 2 months I have been here. So, I am wondering if there are other options when leaving the train station and I have read that there are no Grab in that area. Thank you!

 I was raised in Canada, but my parents are from Phu Thuan An Duong right beside Hue(Ghost Town I know lol). I’m looking to go back with my parents again within 1 or 2 years. I went last year to Hoi An, Da Nang, and a bit of Hue. I went for a week for all 3, which I felt wasn’t enough. I felt as if I was missing a lot out of Da Nang and Hue as I did mostly the touristy stuff. Things that I’ve done was Pagodas(Hue), Golden Bridge(Amusement Park), Lady Buddha, Love Bridge, and Night Market in Da Nang. I was thinking of hitting up Saigon along the way, but I wanted to explore more of my village. My parents didn’t explore much of Hue when they were younger as it was a bit of drive to get into the city.

I matched this girl on Tinder on january around tet 2022 (let called her N) and first N is very kind very nice to me offer to even buy me things at first she catch me off guard by buying me some stuff and kept in mind at this point we havent even met yet,then she starting to stalk my fb account then she’ll said she my friends cousin and i later on confirm that yes she is indeed my friend’s cousin and thay raised trust level in me after a few days she asked me for a gift and valentine is just around the corner so why not ? N asked me to send her 100$ for her gift because i already somewhat trusted N so i send her the money after a while i asked to meet her but she kept asking for more money and being a stupid 19 years old,I send her total 800-900$ ish im not sure around 18mil,then around 3 months talking i found out she was also talking to this singapore guy for nearly 2-3 years and he told me he had plan to come to vietnam to meet her and he also was sending her money which is crazy and idk how much men she had tricked (if you guys are in similar situation or needed more info d/m me)i had kept this secret for so long because it was so stupid and tbh really embarrassing to even tell anyone. p/s:my “friends” that was her cousin told me later on after i told him about her he said they werent that close and she is on his mom family side so before any of you guys said she is catfish ect and tbh with you guys she might be tho,cause she give me her friends bank account everytime i transferred her the money,this is the most dumbest thing i have ever done and idk what’s wrong with me at that moment.I just want to get this off my chest

 I have a trip going up from Singapore through to Vietnam. I currently have two full days and nights in Ho Chi Minh City and was trying to sneak a day to fly over to Hanoi and check it out, really just to say I saw it, but I would say Ho Chi Minh City appeals to me more. Is it worth taking the flight over to see the city or should I just book an extra day in Ho Chi Minh City to see it more completely?
 I might not be back in the area for five to ten years.
 I realize a lot of people will want to reply with something like "It all depends on you" and "We can't know what you enjoy" type comments, but please refrain from those. It's obvious that everyone is different and the right decision for one is not the right decision for another. I guess I'm really just asking if a third day in Ho Chi Minh will be more productive and fun than trying to squeeze whatever I can out of Hanoi in 15 waking hours or so.

 Just wondering, which International Schools are considered the best in terms of salary, work/life balance, culture, allowances, professional development? What is the process of application? Are there any international schools to stay away from? 
 I'm currently an Assistant Principal/Instructional Leader in Australia and have been doing this for the past two years. Previously I was a primary school leader (happy to jump back on class as well.)
 Can someone please explain the "Tiered system" I keep reading about in regards to international school?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From what i've seen, most places are cash only. Being Caucasian, I am obviously a foreigner and a more likely target of scams or straight up robbery. I'm just curious, how much VND is too much to walk around with? If I know i'm going to the market or just to dinner, I know I can plan accordingly, but is it unreasonable to walk around with like 1-2 million VND in smaller bills? Sorry if this is a dumb question.
 EDIT
 Thank you to everyone who took the time to answer, I really appreciate it. Except the dumb dumb that thinks I should carry around 20 million VND like he does. 🤣👍

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. I just moved from Bandung, Indonesia, to Dalat, Vietnam. I really like the change as the new city is something I really enjoy. Except the artistic community—I cannot find any. In Indonesia you have almost everyone having a metal band, playing a traditional instrument or painting. For a lifetime musician and artist it was very important to have it in my life. 
 I also love independent cinema, clip making. Is there anything like that in Da Lat or HCMC? I make rock music, enjoy black metal and many things like that. I love and I need a feeling of a good art community to enjoy life.
 Or it’s better just to focus on life on here and just sometimes go to Bandung and see how the scene is evolving there? 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, long term lurker and first time posting here. My mental health has been derailing extremely bad due to my parents constantly forcing me to endure my granddad’s verbal and emotional abuse. 
 I’m going to visit Vietnam in February and I’m scared for my life. My entire family each has a way to verbally and mentally abuse me but my granddad is by far the worst. He would say things like “you’ll wait till I’m dead then you’d come visit? You ungrateful, disgraceful, uneducated child”, or “why don’t you f**k off and never come back” etc. These episode would last for at least 2-4 hours and he won’t let me leave the room or if it’s a phone call, he’ll cuss me out and hang up without saying anything else. 
 My mom would force me to endure these episodes because “you owe them your life. Who do you think give us money to raise you”. And my dad is just passive aggressive saying things like “it’s fine con, no need to come back and visit us”. And my sister on the other hand is so worried about the inheritance that she’s yelling at me how the West (I’m from the US) has ruined me and my values are killing our chances for a good share of inheritance… I’m just so lost and hurt and I truly don’t want to go back at all. But I have no choice. Is it just my family?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: mất sạch tiền tiết kiệm (đi làm + học bổng) vì tài xỉu trên telegram. Bài học: trên đời chỉ có cứt chim với nước mưa là miễn phí.
 Tuổi trẻ tài lanh, tui mong kiếm được tiền nhiều. Đọc để anh em rút kinh nghiệm nhé. Tui ghi như một trang nhật ký hành trình thôi. Ghi rồi quên, nhưng lâu lâu sẽ lục lại để nhìn về quá khứ.
 Ừm thì, tui tốt nghiệp BK, đi làm kỹ thuật được 1 năm. Cộng với tiền học bổng, tui đi làm thì để dành được 130tr. Tui không đi chơi, ăn uống thì ở nhà. Với tui, đó là một số tiền tiết kiệm kha khá để khởi nghiệp :)
 Nhưng mà khổ một nỗi, sự việc ấy đã đến vào 25/04/2023. Chuyện xảy ra 2 tuần sau khi chia tay bồ. Lúc đó, tui khá trầm cảm. Do lần đầu có người yêu, nên chia tay với tui là cú sốc tâm lý. Bây giờ nghĩ lại, không biết tui quăng tiền vào là vì chia tay rồi nghĩ quẩn, hay thực sự là tui quá non. Dù sao đi nữa, tui cũng ngu như bò.
 Mọi chuyện bắt đầu từ một cuốc điện thoại, rồi qua Zalo, rồi qua Telegram. Trên Telegram, tui nhắn tin với tài khoản NVHD_DUYTUNG. Hắn tự gọi mình là người hướng dẫn và chỉ cách kiếm tiền.
 Bước đầu tiên, hắn cho tui vào nhóm và làm nhiệm vụ. Yêu cầu cũng khá đơn giản. Vào trang web tv360, like bộ phim được chỉ định và chụp lại làm bằng chứng. Mỗi nhiệm vụ được 15000₫, và tui làm được 4 lần. Thế là có 60000₫ bỏ túi. Hay vờ lờ.
 Nhưng mà nhiệm vụ thứ 5 thì khác. Lần này là nhiệm vụ ăn tiền. Chúng nó cho tôi vào một nhóm nhỏ gồm 3 người (tay trong hết). Sau đó, tôi được tạo tài khoản trên trang web chúng nó và bắt đầu chơi tài xỉu. Thề với anh em, trước khi lên đồn trình báo, tôi còn méo biết tôi đang thuộc diện đánh bạc :)
 Nên thôi, anh em rút kinh nghiệm xương máu từ thằng ngu này nhé.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I am a college student in LA and am looking to travel to Vietnam with my girlfriend in the summer. I have no idea where to start. I was looking at a lot of islands by Ha Long and was interested there. I am looking for somewhere with nice water, beaches, and access to city as well. Also, since we are students we would like to minimize the cost as much as possible. So if anyone has any suggestions for cheapest ways to travel to and in vietnam that would be great. Also, how does the currency exchange work? Roughly how much will it cost to eat and do activities in vietnam for 5 days? If anybody can answer even some of my questions and give recommendations that would be amazing.
 ​
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've submitted my paperwork to re-obtain Vietnamese citizenship to the Vietnamese embassy in New York City in person. I have unfortunately never gotten a confirmation number, but I have proof over text message that I got an appointment in August 2023 to go in and submit all the requested paperwork. 
 All my attempts to get an update from anyone over email, text and phone call have been completely ignored. And I don't know what to do anymore. How can I hold them accountable and give me an update? 
 I know I definitely qualify, and the guy I spoke to last said they are working on it, but that was in September. It's a bit of an urgent matter, so I'd like to at least understand if they will never give it to me for some reason, so I can involve a third party service, unless somebody here may have any other suggestions? 
 Would really appreciate constructive insights!

 Hiện tại mình dùng 1660s với một con màn được nhận 60hz nhưng thật tế nó là 144hz. Có thể do dây chưa đúng chuẩn nên chưa thử được.
 Câu hỏi của mình: Tại sao 1660s chạy ở 60hz hoặc 75hz ở một số tựa game chỉ đạt được ~170fps và card chạy rất nóng 70 80, kêu rất to.
 Ngược lại lúc được đẩy lên 120hz thì có dấu hiệu giảm? 
 Vậy có phải mình phải chạy chuẩn 144hz full HD thì mới đạt nhiệt độ ổn 50 60 và không kêu to nữa ko?
 Mình ngu ngơ công nghệ, anh em có thể giải thích mình rõ hơn được không ạ? Cám ơn anh em
 Trên thực tế em xem test thì ít nhất cũng 250 đến 300fps

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a female backpacker and have been travelling through Vietnam for a few weeks (I have been to Ha Noi, HCMC and Nha Trang so far). I am overweight and in my research about the country I learnt in advance that the topic of weight comes up very often and that the cultural approach to the topic is very different than for example in europe where I come from. Now it has actually happened to me many times here that I have been asked about my weight or have been pressurised by strange men to get on a scale etc., but as I have already anticipated this, I try not to be too hurt and just let it pass me by. However, I haven't had a single really friendly encounter in Vietnam so far and I'm really starting to wonder whether it's because of my weight that I'm being treated more disrespectfully? I'm a very polite person and try to smile a lot and always say please, thank you, hello and goodbye but I never get a reply and hardly anyone speaks to me for more than two words (unless it's about my weight). 
 As I am travelling alone, the experience of being here feels very lonely and sad and I wonder if I can change anything personally or if it really is my appearance?
 Edit: as I think it's important. I am really overweight like 40kg too much. Not like 10kg and just a bit more chubby.

Kiểu mình đâu có làm gì sai mà sao người ta lại cư xử như vậy, như cố tình huỷ hoại mqh rồi khiến cái ko khí mqh nặng nề. 
 như ba mình với mẹ mình, mẹ mình chung thuỷ ko có lỗi gì, nhưng từ xưa ba mình đã xưng mày tao với mẹ, rồi chửi những lời rất cay nghiệt, chửi cả ông bà ngoại, con cái, chửi mẹ mình khốn nạn, đồ con chó, v.v. từ xưa mình đã nghe những trận chửi đánh và mình ước gì có thể là con của những người nhìn hiền hoà, nc nhẹ nhàng, dĩ hoà vi quý.... chứ ko phải như hiện thực gđ mình. 
 a mình cũng vậy, đi chửi mấy đứa e là mất dậy, đạo đức giả, diễn, giả tạo, những cái từ ngữ đó khiến mình thấy tồi tệ và bất an. Kiểu như ổng chửi người khác để che lấp con người hãm của ổng. Khi ổng y chang những câu ổng chửi người khác. 
 những lời chửi xúc phạm khiến một đứa chỉ cần ai nói nặng lời cũng bị tổn thương khiến nó như nhấn chìm tinh thần mình xuống. 
 Mình ko phải một đứa ưa ngọt, ưa nịnh, nếu có gì phàn nàn thì cũng phàn nàn một cách vừa phải, nc bình thường chứ đâu phải thốt ra những từ ngữ cay nghiệt bạo lực ngôn ngữ như vậy. 
 Cuộc sống mọi người xung quanh như thế nào, có gặp những người hay chửi cay nghiệt ko

 For both of these meals, we were given accompaniments to wrap the meats with. We were also given small rectangular sheets of rice paper.
 From our limited communication with the restaurant staff, we understood that you just wrapped everything up in the rice paper dry and ate it like that, without softening it with water.
 Did we get that correct? 
 I’m trying to recreate these dishes at home now, and I bought some rice paper, but it seems a bit too hard to wrap like the ones we had in Vietnam. Did I buy the wrong rice paper? Or are we suppose to make it pliable with water first and then dry it back out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Briefly, I was in a 3 year relationship with a Vietnamese girl who has lived in a western country since she was a teenager. She is 36 now. She is very westernised in the sense of liberal thought, accent etc, however her parents are very traditional. I am from a non-Vietnamese background. 
 She had recently divorced her husband who is Vietnamese. They had an 8 year old son. I also have a son of the same age. Early in the relationship, her ex-husband would come around to her apartment when I was there for the custody change over. She asked me to ‘hide’ in her room so that he would not see me. She claimed that he was still talking to her mother and would tell her she has a boyfriend. 
 I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but this continued for months. I never met her parents. She told me this was ‘cultural’ and her mother would come around eventually. 
 I made to the mistake of meeting up with her on an overseas trip to the US which she had taken with her sister, to meet up with their cousins. I was told that I had to meet her in a neutral location, as I could not see the cousins because her mother had told them that she was still married. During this trip she broke up with me. We got back together a few times, but this issue continued and caused a lot of issues. Eventually, she broke up with me by text message after 3 years of emotional investment and me hoping things would change. I never saw her again.

 The officer had limited English but showed up at our door and demanded to be let in to our home to check our passports. 
 We let him in, and after writing up some report that we could not read, he told us (through translator app) we did not meet whatever requirements for residency (or something like that). 
 He then tried to get us to sign the report, which I refused saying i won’t sign something I can’t read. 
 My husband called our Airbnb host who spoke with the officer and then told us we didn’t have to sign anything. shortly after the officer left. 
 For some context, we have been in our airbnb in Da Nang for 2.5 weeks (will be here another 2). My husband and i are here with our 2 year old. We just work all day while he goes to daycare basically.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL:DR. Wonderful tea house with a magical atmosphere and the kindest family running it. They’ll pour you free tea of any kind, and tell you about Vietnamese culture and tea.
 Chà Trà Tea Room - 5 Ngõ 73 Giang Văn Minh, Đội Cấn, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam
 Long story - We wandered in this alley and discovered this tea house. They immediately welcomed us. It was the brother of the owner and a local guest, drinking tea. The place looks like a museum, displaying about a hundred of handmade teapots, which are the owner’s collection. 
 They offered us to take a seat, and started brewing tea for us, and it was delicious. Then they offered me to seat in the brewer’s place, with all the equipment and asked me to try brew some tea, teaching me the ceremony procedure. Then the owner’s son approached, and he could speak English so he started translating and telling us about the history of the store, the teas, etc, asking us about our travelling, our country. It felt so warm, welcoming, it was the highest level of hospitality. Then they brought also boiled corn, while changing teas and brewing more and more. They didn’t ask or accept a penny, and said that drinking tea there is free for anyone. Afterwards the Owner (the dad), his wife, and his friend ( some national tea expert) came. They started making even more tea, that tasted too good to be true. The dad started telling us about the tea culture in Vietnam, about their hospitality, healing properties of the teas, the soul component, it was genuinely wonderful and exciting. Almost 3 hours flew by in a blink. We got to buy a pu-erh cake that is made with tea between 200-500 years old. 
 The interior is really cozy, and the atmosphere is so tranquil and peaceful. We loved it, and i think that it should be much much much more popular. Their family is wonderful and made us feel like home!

 Thank you for anyone have joined the last survey about monopoly. However, due to the requirement of information about the players (The "Who" part in 5W+1H), my team had to make another Goggle form to get some information about boardgame players in general rather than only monopoly alone. This help us get a better understanding about the relationship between players lifestyle and their preference on the theme. (Honestly, I don't know why but they wanted to)
 The link I post here is the translated version: https://forms.gle/qPatvVe1xD8jbBh48
 The form will include the following question:
  
Genders
 Age range
 Location (The continets you from)
 Occupation
 How you depict your lifestyle?
 Have you heard or played any boardgame before?
 The reasons you came to board game?
 Something you don't like about the board game you've played?
 Where you often played board game?
 Favorite theme.
  
I hope to get some respond from you guys soon and sorry for being weird. Bye~
 For Vietnamese, you can use this local / original Vietnamese version: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxBOm-Mp2jzBeqAkrKMrzu-5FEvMj3NtDlcujECbeHXCA2sQ/viewform
 Update: Added question about Location.

Right now I am finishing some things with my MA and will be moving around a bit so I don't expect to look for a job until after Tet. I ran into a foreigner that has been working here for 5 years that said he just paid a visa agent when he got here to get him a work permit before he had a job and that I should just do that. 
 Is that:
 A. completely illegal and should be avoided at all costs? 
 B. Quasi-legal and not a big deal? 
 C. Not a problem at all but might cost a little bit more money (he said he paid $400 usd for everything) than the regular way of getting a job offer and going from there?
 D. Something else I haven't thought of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am Vietnamese and have both Vietnamese and American passport. I visit Vietnam pretty often and figure having a bank account is probably the best option (as opposed to using my visa credit card or exchanging for cash). I just need to pay people while in Vietnam using ebanking, no need for international transfers. Document wise I only have the passport. What's my best option? Is there a bank that won't require otp for every transaction? I want to be able to pay for things when I'm in the US too (and won't have the phone number)

I'm a backpacker travelling Vietnam on a scooter alone, so after arriving to Nha Trang in the evening I checked into my hostel, had dinner and then decided to go for a short walk.
 I went into a electronics store, didn't buy anything and then further along my walk bought a donut from a bakery street vendor. By this point its about 9pm and I turn onto a street lined with cafe's on one side busy with people sitting outside. For reference I was approximately here https://goo.gl/maps/9nZTxkBiGEX414Jg6

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guys, Tet is coming up, and there are a lot of con artists. I ran into someone this morning while riding my motorbike, and they claimed I hit their motorbike and demanded 100,000 to get it fixed. They forced me to brake as they rode ahead of me. Although I was a little apprehensive, I offered them 200,000 to solve the situation and asked for change because I didn't want to get into any difficulty(lmao I'm that naive). I also believed that I had struck their motorbike. But after taking a peek at my wallet and realizing I had a lot of cash, they demanded more. Now that I knew they were trying to scam me, I seized the opportunity to "steal" my 200,000 and fled as quickly as possible. 
 They looked so gangster-like that I believed I had somehow lost my sense of reason. Oh and they did that on a crowd street too.

I tried Don Duck, it was nice, maybe there are better ones, I don’t know. The thing is I haven’t had the courage to try the street food. Some don’t look really hygienic. 
 Could anyone recommend their favorite restaurants and/or food stalls in Hanoi? I want to try Banh Mi and also open for other recommendations.
 Thanks!

 1) Has anyone experienced issues with airport customs when taking PC parts as carry-on luggage? I know they wouldn't care if it was a laptop, but perhaps they might think I'm trying to sell the components.
 2) As far as I'm aware I don't need a voltage converter to safely plug in my UK power supply, just a plug converter, is this correct? Any other tips to protect my PC? Last time I was in VN there were blackouts, I've got a UK multi plug which has a surge protector which I can bring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is a repeat post, but my family (43M (American), 39F (Born in Vietnam, but is a US citizen,) and two children under 12 (both born in the US) will be traveling to Vietnam this fall. 
 Last time we were there (my wife and I), every hotel we stayed at required us to surrender our passports to the hotel until our departure. They would claim the government required this to report us to the local establishment. We had one bad incident where the hotel has bugs and we requested to leave immediately, but they would not give us our passports until we paid them (even though we didn't stay more than an hour). 
 Is this still a standard practice? To clarify, we did stay at local establishments, not corporate companies, like Hilton. First, we had concerns if we would even get our passports back, and our other concern was if something should happen while we were exploring that we would need it. Thank you for the advice!

 1.Can Vietnamese connect to international internet with freedom?
 2.Is it safe to criticize the general secretary directly?
  
Are most people satisfied with the communist party in Vietnam?
 
If you feel that your right is hurt, is it useful to report it to the government and will the government help you?
 
 The answers in China are no. So I am curious about the answers in Vietnam.

 I hope you all are well.
 I am planning to visit Vietnam, and thought to book the first week at a homestay to save costs.
 Do you have any advice on keeping my belongings safe when I leave them at the homestay? I could strap every important item to my body and triple-lock it, but that can get inconvenient.
 Any ideas? Should I just splurge for a proper hotel with a safe?
 Thanks in advance.

 During our daughters first birthday I was able to meet her extended family and someone must have said something because grandfather showed up. He said he was relieved I was not white, they had only told him I was American so he didn’t know I was Mexican American. He bid me to drink rice wine with him and he was very friendly after I told him California and Texas were taken from Mexico. He replied ‘you’re not American by choice!’
 Let me tell you this wasn’t an experience I thought I would ever have.

Mỗi người sẽ có cv phù hợp riêng và ko nên ép bản thân phải làm cv mà mình thấy ko hợp đúng ko mn. Vì mình biết mình chậm chạp luống cuống mình ko làm đc. 
 Như người ta nói mình sang làm pha chế, pha chế ko giới hạn độ tuổi với lương cao, đỡ chạy bàn nhiều, nghe danh làm pha chế cũng oai hơn là làm phục vụ. Mấy người lanh tay chân khỏe nhanh thường làm pha chế chứ ít người chịu làm phục vụ vì nó cực có chỗ còn kiêm cả tạp vụ dọn dẹp. Phục vụ thường làm part time chứ full time mấy ai có sức làm, người nào làm vì cần tiền mới làm. 
 Mình kiểu thất nghiệp loser nên đi làm phục vụ cho có cv có lương mỗi tháng. Nếu nghỉ chỗ này thì chỉ biết đi xin làm phục vụ chỗ khác. Chứ cũng chẳng biết làm gì khác. Dù cv phải tiếp xúc với rất nhiều người, va chạm đủ thứ khiến mình một đứa hướng nội thiếu tự tin choáng ngợp và tụt năng lượng chỉ muốn rời chỗ làm ra chỗ chỉ có một mình. Mình thấy khó khăn trong suy nghĩ tâm lý và mình ko hợp làm việc tập thể, mình thấy mình khác biệt.
 Còn tự tạo công việc online nào đó trong phòng mình thì mình thấy chán chường, có những yếu tố con người nhà toxic, những lời lẽ cay nghiệt khiến tinh thần mình như bị nhấn chím xuống ko làm đc cái gì... Mình mở phim mở nhạc lên để chill khiến tâm trạng tốt hơn đỡ buồn chán. Rồi mãi trì hoãn những việc tưởng tượng trong đầu. Vòng lặp đó mình biết nó sẽ thế trong năm mới.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm travelling to Vietnam on the 8th of February. I had booked everything, all bussess and accommodations. The plan was to go to Ha Giang on the February the 10th and do the Ha Giang Loop for 4 days and then go to Cat Ba.
 However, my bus got cancelled on the 10th of February because of the Tết Holiday in Vietnam. I've tried booking other busses on the 9th, 10th and 11th of February, but all got cancelled. Travelling on the 8th is not really an option, because I arrive late in the evening in Hanoi.
 Do you guys have any tips regarding travelling to Ha Giang on the 10th of February during the Tết holiday? Is travel by bus possible at all during this period?
 Thank you in advance!

 I've never seen them installed in any kind of convenient stores in Vietnam, or at least in Circle K shops in Hanoi. How do they prevent thefts, prevent someone just coming in and steal something and walk away? I know for sure for many times I walk in and walk out just looking around without buying anything then leave, and no one really pays any mind. How are they so sure that I didn't steal anything?

 Then once I have my luggage and my checked box, the guys at the exit would scan my stuff and even if I follow all the rules, they’ll say they detected something like fish or meat in my box. I’d say nope, I don’t have any and they’ll threaten to cut open all my boxes to make sure, or they’ll just let me go with some “coffee” money ($10) per security guy. There’s usually 2 of them. 
 One time I tried to stand up for myself and told them I’m following all the laws and regulations, they cut my box opened right there and moved my stuff all over then told me I’m good to go without giving me tape to fix the box….
 I only see this happen to other Vietnamese?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I will be 23 soon this year. I am trying to decide if I should try for Peace Corp in VN (that is if I get accepted/I pass the medical exams), or try for TEFL.I am trying to see if I should try applying for Peace Corp in VN or just do TEFL in Vietnam. I am currently doing an English teaching volunteer experience as of now (soon I might get a temporary teacher's assistant position), graduated already with a bachelors and have a TEFL cert. My Vietnamese is at A2 (heritage speaker) and I am working to improve it.
 My goals is to see more of the culture in everyday life and learn more of the language. I am unsure of the pros and cons to either option. That being said I would like to do Peace Corp at some point in my life. Either way I would need to save up it turns out when the VN cohort leaves is approximately around the same time I plan to leave.I see that by the time of this year, I will probably be at a low B1.
 My main concerns are really if I would be able to learn the language to around B2/C1 by the end of the two years (plans are to continue taking classes and studying, as well as using the language as much as I can). I did post in the TEFL and peace corp subreddits but I wanted to get some perspectives. I was recommended by a user on r/expats to post here too.
 Originally my plan is if I get accepted to Peace Corp in VN (assuming I get accepted and pass the medical/legal exams) and I go, I would do it for the entire duration and then evaluate. If not, I would do TEFL for two years and then evaluate. Right now I graduated but I haven't found anything in my field and I figured I might as well get my Vietnamese to advanced since that is what I wanted to do since I was a kid. I could go back to the States and do a different career afterwards, sure I would be setback but I don't have much to lose.
 I would also like to see if anyone has experience doing either TEFL or Peace Corp or something similar to what I am wanting to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. My uncle died in VN (he’s a US citizen as are most of the family). He has an estranged son (none of us know him or are in contact with him) and while my other uncles and mom was handling the death certificate, the US consulate was able to get a hold of his son. Unfortunately his son considered some options verbally but stopped responding, so there’s nothing in writing. There is no will. My uncle also has no assets.
 We have the means (and want to) bury him as we have a family cemetery in VN. It seems like my parents and other uncles couldn’t get permission to move forward with the burial. How does next of kin responsibilities work? Can’t they just keep going down the line of kin if the first one doesn’t take action? I’m just sad that his body is stuck at the hospital indefinitely and none of us can get closure.
 I also don’t want my family to get in trouble if they attempt to get the body from the hospital. Does anyone know if we should try to get a Vietnamese lawyer involved or if there’s anything more we can do?
 Thanks!

We paid extra for the exit row seats and as we were about to take off one of the staff told my partner she had to put her purse in the over head storage which I thought was odd but he came back and asked a few times before making her place it up there. She had both our passports, credit cards, $800AUD and my wallet in her purse so she wasn’t happy about it leaving her side. The flight departed at 2:30am so as you’d expect we fell asleep. Only realising as soon as we’d left the airport that the cards and cash were gone. 
 Has anyone had a similar experience? Not really sure what to do here or who to report it to.

We have often been told that it's not possible for those who haven't traveled to any other countries to apply for a Schengen visa. While we can afford to travel for one week in Europe, we do not have enough funds to visit other nearby countries beforehand. I believe that as long as we have proper documentation, can prove that we have enough budget to finance our trip, and have a well-prepared travel plan - in this case, it's on the tour agency's side - we will be able to obtain a travel visa. But, is that not enough?
 Thank you in advance.
 edit: What if I only have one year left till my passport expires? If I travel to several SEA countries this year, get a new passport next year, do my past travels still count?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that I have to respect the elders, but it always frustrates me so much. 
 I have some medical problems, and I have to visit the hospital like once a month. It's the hospital, so most of the people there tend to be older, like 50 and above
 And they always cut the line no matter what they do. I was waiting for my turn for an X-ray, and I could see grandpas trying to cut the line, storming into the doctor's office trying to get the service they want despite seeing lines of other people waiting, just for them to be politely asked to get out and get in line.
 At the cashier, it was even worse, everyone was like all trampling all over each other, trying to squeeze against each other in order to be the one that got the service first. It frustrated me so much because I was like, what was the hurry? Just wait in a goddamn line. Waiting in line wouldn't even work because someone would always try to cut it, and they wouldn't even care that they hit many people in the course of doing so.
 And don't even make me start with the bus. They always must be the one who gets in first and got the best seat even if it causes some jamming. 
 I see this type of behaviour much more often in our older generation, like 50 and above, than our younger counterpart.
 Do you guys notice the same thing too, or is it just the people where I live?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning to go to Vietnam for my honeymoon (we're from Canada). We would ideally like to go sometime between September and December (2-3 weeks), but I've heard this is peak monsoon season, making us wary. We would like to visit Hanoi, Ha long Bay, Ninh Binh, Hoi An, Con Dao, and HCMC. We want to do beaches, some hiking and sight-seeing. Would you recommend any time within these months for this visit? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically what the title says. I was wondering if anyone’s used a Grab to travel distance of four hours? I’ve used it for 2 1/2 hours before but I was around Ho Chi Minh City so I think maybe that was something to do with it. Grab will seemingly let me order the ride, but I’m not sure if the driver can see the destination before he accepts or not? If anyone has any experience with this or something like it, I would love to hear it.

 One example i found is a gôi ôm pillow. Articles like these that aren’t too in-your-face are what I’m looking for.

 So I gave her a nickname...Li Lo (Lee Low).
 She doesn't like it because it sounds like a Vietnamese phrase which means 'impish child' or 'energetic troublesome child'.
 BUT...she can't find it online because she doesn't know the exact phrase.
 Does anybody know the phrase...or is she being troublesome?
 Hint: 'lee low' is only a part of the phrase.

 Is Grab available all over Da Lat? I will be travelling with my partner and not too sure if xe oms are safe enough for us, will prefer to opt for grab / taxis if possible. 
 Any scams (e.g. taxi scams) to look out for in Da Lat?
 How would you recommend travelling to HCM? Currently stuck between Vietjet & VIP sleeper bus
 
 Also, if you do have any places of recommendation please feel free to drop!

I want their names to have meaning and it’s important to the story but I also want to show respect to the Vietnamese language and naming practices. I understand that the way a Vietnamese name is written is Surname/Middle name/Given name and that the person is always greeted by their given name but (so I have read). I really don’t want to just use google translate and total screw it up and come off super ignorant. I understand that Nguyên is the most common surname in Vietnam so I have already chosen that surname for my Vietnamese characters. They are supposed to have common names as I’m trying to have them represent a large part of the general public on both the Vietnam side of the story and the American side (Smith is the surname of my American characters). So as for the Vietnamese names I need help finding something that works for:
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Bright Moon (feminine, born 1930)
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Day Star (masculine, born 1925)
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Night Star (masculine, born 1951)
 Nguyên, (middle and given name that together mean): Caring Soul (feminine, born 1932)
 Thank you so much, I appreciate anyone who can give me a hand.

I'm simply using them as an example, as I have seen enough people citing their sources, or mentioning them during medical discourse. 
 Quite a lot of friction between me and my wife and in-laws comes to light whenever me, my wife or son get sick. At first sight of a sore throat or runny nose I am told that I need to take antibiotics instantly otherwise my sickness will develop into something more nasty (commonly thrown around sicknesses are viêm phổi (pneumonia) or viêm họng…]]></summary>

Ever where I look people young and old were smoking out of bamboo pipes. Coming from California they look like bongs but I heard a whistle when an old man took a toke off one and I didn't smell any Marijuana. This morning walking out of an egg coffee place I see a guy packing one of these pipes, he was tightly rolling something in his fingers to load into the pipe. Is this tobacco?? I assume people aren't smoking cannabis, hash, or opium out in the open like this.

The bike I ride at home is a Harley Davidson with taller handlebars that fit my body better. My bike is much bigger than any of the bikes i have seen for sale/rent in Vietnam. Are there any options to buy/rent a bike on the bigger side that wont hurt my back after a long ride from being hunched over?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào các bạn!
 I (24F) am travelling to Saigon soon to meet my family and relatives. I'll be staying for the whole month of february and I am looking for casual and wholesome hangouts with locals as well as other Viet kieus/expats/tourists if possible. 
 I am born and raised in Sweden and currently work as a freelance Swedish-Vietnamese interpreter. So conversing in any language is fine for me (VN, ENG, SWE). 
 My hobbies include: * Dancing (k-pop, traditional chinese dance, girly hip-hop, pole dance)
  
Learning foreign languages (self-studying Mandarin and Italian atm)
 
Meeting and talking to new people (huge extrovert)
 
Explore new places and hangout spots (love adventures)
 
Makeup, clothes, shopping, reading, eating good food, snacking (streetfood etc.)
 
 I dislike: * Clubbing (grown out of it unfortunately), but loud and lively bars are fun! 
  
Selfish and egocentric people 
 
Gambling (not for me, and I lose all the time at tiếng lên 😭)
 
Alcohol in large quantities. I'm not much for the nhậu culture but I'm fine if other people wants to do it as long as it doesn't spiral out of control
 
 I'm only open for 1-1 meetups with girls. Otherwise I'd love to have a mixed group of people to make plans with.
 See you in Saigon! 🥰

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last time I travelled to Vietnam and went looking for hair/fashion accesoaries in the likes of these I didn't have much luck. My cousin instead told me that you'd mostly find these in online stores like Shopee and ordered them for me. 
 This time I'd like to find real life shops/districts that sell these types of "cutesy douyin" inspired accesoaries. 
 Anyone got recommendations in Saigon?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently on a trip in Vietnam with my parents who have not been back home in almost 30 years. They immigrated to America when they were in their early 20s, so I was born and raised there. My mom's talking to our cab driver about how much Vietnam has changed then as well as the cultural and value differences between the two countries. Specifically their conversation about family values had me in tears. I knew that Vietnamese culture has a very heavy emphasis on family. Most times, you got whole generations living in the same house. Everybody is constantly supporting and looking after one another like parents will provide for their kids regardless of their age. Similarly, even after the children are all grown up, they stay behind to take care of their family. However, American family values is not like that. Sure children love their parents, but they're quick to move on and live their life as soon as they're able to support themselves. Which I would say is true. Lot of kids try to move out as soon as they hit 18 which is considered a transition to adulthood. I think a good amount of them will use college as their escape from home. My brothers and I all have goals to move out, start our own careers/lives as soon as we're able to, and she's expecting to probably go to a nursing home when she's unable to take care of herself. I just honestly feel so guilty and sad that she feels like that. Of course I want to be able to take care of my parents. I don't want to stick them in the nursing home but at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in the same place until it's my parents' time. I haven't thought about anything like that til now, and I'm not really sure what I would even do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I have noticed is that at many Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in New Zealand, the customers at any given time seem to be mostly Vietnamese or other Southeast Asians(Laotian, Cambodian) or East Asians(Korean, Japanese, Chinese) with not many non-Southeast Asians/East Asians. On the other hand, I notice much more diverse clientele at, Italian, Japanese, Thai, and (westernized) Chinese restaurants. When I lived in Australia, however, there were a lot more non-Asians eating in Vietnamese restaurants.
 For Australia, I know that Vietnamese have a longer history there than in New Zealand, and people are thus much more familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, but I still found it interesting how Vietnamese food seemed to be proportionately more popular among non-Asians in Australia than among non-Asians in New Zealand, despite the fact that Australia and New Zealand are neighboring countries.
 So, out of curiosity, at Vietnamese restaurants in Vietnam and other countries, how popular are they among non-Asians? Do you come across Vietnamese restaurants with diverse clienteles?

We are a group of 4 planning on visiting Vietnam for a month in April starting in Saigon and moving our way North (eventually having to come back to Saigon to fly back home). I was thinking to rent a car for the four of us to be able to travel from city to city to avoid taking the train/bus as I wanted us to be able to travel on our own time and not be at the whim of bus/train schedules as well as be able to make pit stops and enjoy the scenery along the way. Ideally would love to be able to rent in Saigon and drop off the car in Hanoi and fly back to Saigon to catch the plane back home. Aside from driving inside Saigon (as I know traffic looks a little hectic) is driving a car around Vietnam recommended, safe, convenient, practical?

 I was going to book in Hoi An but I’m reading now that it’s super touristy with pushy vendors.
 What are alternative locations that are relatively easy to get to from Da Nang airport? 
 We like peace and quiet, natural sights and good food. My wife can be a bit squeamish about cleanliness.

It was during a time when I was nervous about returning to Vietnam and meeting my relatives that I have not met a long time ago. So after visiting Vietnam and meeting my family and talking them (in English), I kind of have some newfound respect on Vietnamese language. Despite currently having little economical, political, and entertainment advantage compared to languages like Mandarin, French, Japanese, etc. I somehow wanted to take the commitment to learn Vietnamese. Despite these disadvantages, I wanted to learn Vietnamese because so that I can just have a nice chat with the locals and my relatives. It just as simple as that. So yeah. I do not know if people care enough about this post, but that is what I experienced after visiting Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just returned home from my Vietnam trip and would recommend going there to anyone interested in that part of Asia. The country is beautiful and the people are very friendly. When visiting the Mekong delta we stopped at a little village producing coconut candy and snake wine. Tried it, liked the taste and decided to buy two bottles to drink with friends once I get home. 
 My questions are:
 1) The bottle says NSX 1.12.2023., after googling NSX I found out it means manufacturing date. As far as I knew snake wine has to ferment with the snake in it for about 3 months and only a month and a half passed since this was produced so is it drinkable?
 2) My tour guide said after finishing the bottle it can be reused by adding other strong alcohol for about a year, is this true?
 3) Anyone know what the little branches are in the bottle?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today while I was sitting on a park bench, a young man approached me and asked if he could practice his English with me (I know, I know - I should’ve known then).
 After chatting for a little bit he started talking about his dream to move to New York in the States and work as a technician or customer service rep.
 He sat down and showed me pictures he’d made of all the places in the world he’d love to travel.
 … and then he went into his sales pitch mode.
 Basically he talked about how weak the VND and Vietnamese passport are and how strong the American Dollar and passport are, and how he needs $10k in the bank (among other requirements) to get a visa into the USA.
 He showed me these bracelets he was selling and pictures he’d taken with other people he had met who had bought one to help him towards his dream.
 He had a picture with goal prices dependent on your currency and for USD he wanted $32. I ended up giving him $20 (500k VND) just because I liked him and was inspired by his story given that I’m a traveler too. 
 He added me to his WhatsApp and told me that he would text me when he makes it to New York so we can meet up again.
 It was all very sweet and whether it was a scam or not, I don’t feel all that bad about it.
 But I am just curious whether you think this was a scam or genuinely just a dude trying to follow his dreams?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_ethnic_nationalism
 I found this interesting Wikipedia article that helps put into context many of the comments recently about Koreans in Vietnam. It's a good history lesson for anyone interested and puts things into historical and cultural perspective.
 According to the article "Korean ethnic nationalism (Korean: 한국의 민족주의), or Korean racial nationalism,[2] is a racist, chauvinist, and ethnosupremacist political ideology and a form of ethnic and racial identity that is widely prevalent amongst Koreans, particularly in South Korea". 
 It goes on to give many sources which explains the history of Korean ethnic nationalism, where it started, and when those ideologies diverged historically from countries like Germany and Japan.

She never renounced Vietnamese citizenship, but never renewed her passport, and Canada has always allowed dual citizenship. Question: Did she retain Vietnamese citizenship to this day?
 I am reading about the laws and it is very confusing given multiple changes in the past decade. In 2009 Vietnam recognized dual citizenship and said those who had left Vietnam prior must renew their passport to retain citizenship. This was extended to 2014 as very few did it. Again, it seems this was extended or cancelled, I don’t know about this part. Anyone in a similar circumstance successfully renewed their passports from abroad after decades? Cảm ơn

 My gf is white and my family is viet so my parents have some interesting things to say about vietnam and i couldnt tell if they were being genuine or trying to scare us.
 Im mostly worried about cash. How much cash (american USD and vietnamese VND) should we keep on us? My mom kept saying crisp 100 dollar bills but wtf? Also she said to keep money in your passports to get through airport security quick?
 Also, how likely are we to get scammed? My mom believes locals are mean and will try to scam you and rob you. I just want to get first hand experience advice so I feel more prepared than through my parents who havent been back since the 90s/early 2000s!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a follow up post to Going to visit a woman in the Mekong Delta
 So I went to visit her and had a great time. I stayed with her in her apartment for five days and she basically treated me like I was her boyfriend. She spent a lot of time with me, showed me around, gave me her motorcycle and instructions to explore while she had to do some work. She took me out, cooked for me and even did my laundry. We slept together. And we got to talk and get to know each other a little bit.
 I've never experienced anything like it. She is a very attractive, smart young woman. 
 After leaving and coming back to Saigon I felt I wanted to spend more time with her before going back to Europe in a couple of weeks, so I told her that I'd like to see her again. She said I was invited again and that I can stay until I need to go back to Europe (two weeks). I slept on it and decided that I actually want to spend some more time in the city before going back and that spending that much time with her might be too much for me. We then spoke on the phone and I told her that I'd like to come again for 5 days and she got upset and offended that I didn't want to spend all of my time with her and told me it's better we don't see each other then.
 And that was it. I actually wanted to spend more time with her and see where things could possibly go, but it would have been very difficult because she lives and works in a more rural area. I'm not sure what her intentions were exactly, but I appreciated the experience.

Let's talk about the environment. In the video clip, you can clearly see an excavator digging into the seabed. The question arises: Is it legal for them to build a tram station in the sea? Vinpearl tourism seems to be contributing to environmental destruction, contrary to the "green environment" advocated by Vinfast.

 ​
 I am currently planning my trip to Vietnam. I come from UK. 
 I would love to stay in an ensuite room somewhere in Vietnam as I like the flexibility of not having a long term contract and not sure an agency will rent to me for a short term of like 3 months.
 ​
 I want to as, do hotels offer rooms for discounted price if I rent a whole month?
 I am looking for private room with its own bathroom + wifi etc, and would like to pay around 200GBP a month. IS this possible? 
 ​
 I am new to traveling. Could someone elaborate on this please?

 I travel frequently so a hectic itinerary is not an issue. I want to make the most out of our trip. You might have an itinerary you can share to get my planning started. I’m traveling in the first week of May.
 If you have food itinerary that you can share, that would be great! :) want to try a lot of Vietnamese food/cuisines and or course, coffee.
 thank you!

 There's a dedicated Chinese zodiac sign to these creatures, so if anything, I assume they are instead associated with some set of universal virtues and flaws. On the other hand, biblical symbolism of snake should not make an outlandish concept for Vietnamese people, as the French left a significant impact on the culture.
 So what's the meaning behind a snake one could think of in the first place?

 Four exchange students living in South Australia have disappeared in the past months, leaving police and their host families baffled.
 The teenagers disappeared at different times in December and January and Daily Mail Australia understands police are treating each case as separate incidents. 
 In the latest case, Sunnie Nguyen, 17, was last seen at her host family's home in South Plympton on Monday, and now her phone has been disconnected and her social media accounts wiped.

 However, today marked the day when I let my guard down and someone took direct advantage of it.
 After an exhausting day of traveling through multiple airports and planes, my partner and I arrived in HCMC this evening.
 Exhausted, tired, and hungry, we desired minimal conversation, so we headed straight to the cabs at the airport and boarded the first cab available. In retrospect, it was a significant mistake—one we wouldn't typically make. Perhaps we had grown too complacent due to consistently positive experiences over the last few years, ignoring several red flags that should have set off alarm bells.
 The cab was an unremarkable SUV with a small blue sign and a very modest blue logo on the side, not Vinasun …]]></summary>

 Me and my friend are currently on a backpacking trip around SE Asia. We were planning on starting our Vietnam portion of the trip around the 8th-10th of February, entering from Cambodia into HCMC. We’ve recently been informed that Tet celebrations are during this period. I am personally blaming the fact that we have done the least amount of research on Vietnam as it is the last destination of our trip as to why this was new information to us.
 We have since done a bit of research and have seen conflicting opinions on how much will actually be open/ what we will be able to do in HCMC during this period and was wondering if anyone here would be able to enlighten us. While we think the idea of getting to see the celebrations would be a really cool opportunity, we also don’t want to be stuck in our hostel for days and struggling to find food to eat etc. If this was the case we may extend our Cambodia section of the trip and travel to HCMC at a later date. 
 Thanks very much
