 I plan to rent a motorcycle, but I'm scared of being stopped by officers on the road. I have license, but I'm from a different country.
 ​
 Question is:
 - How to get there if I'm not going to use a rented motorcycle?
 - Is it safe to just go there using a rented motorcycle?
 - Should I book from taxi mobile application? 
 - Is commute an easy way?
 ​
 Thank you so much, Peeps!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning to arrive in HCMC tomorrow for 2 weeks with additional week in Da Nang. Seek your quick advice:
  
SIM Card?: I have been suggested its better to not buy at the airport. Plan is to get a Grab to my hotel, check in, and then find some shop for SIM Card. However, can you recommend which SIM Card/company is better? (Just want reliable internet/data)
 
Where to exchange currency?: While airport is a no go (will exchange just enough for taxi and check in), curious if there're any specific places with great exchange rates? (Eg. SuperRich in Bangkok is known for its highly competitive exchange rate). 
 
 Or Is it feasible to withdraw money from the ATM? (Again, eg. in Bangkok, you are charged 220 THB right away for every ATM withdrawal so unless you're withdrawing chunk of cash, its just dropping money on avoidable)
  
Worth it to drive moped/bike to get around? For reference, I have driven in South Asia so I am quite used to...uh, interesting drivers.

 I figured maybe someone in VN has the same problem and found a good way to stop, or bought something?

After school I ended up hating electrical engineering and took a job working in media out of college, but I hated that too. Then in early 2020 I switched careers to IT and got a bunch of basic IT certifications. I have been working as IT support for the last 3 years. I am by no means an IT expert, but I at least have some idea of what I'm doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left my phone in my grab at around 1am. I’m able to track it using my work phone and have been following it for most of the night.
 I set my phone as lost on ‘Find My iPhone’ with the following message Chiếc iphone này bị bỏ lại sau khi nhặt, vui lòng gọi (dads phone number here) để trả lại càng sớm càng tốt hoặc chuyển đến Fusion Suites Sài Gòn or WhatsApp (my phone number here, as I have WhatsApp on this phone instead of my personal)
 The best part is that as soon as I did that the driver did actually call my dad but unfortunately due to language constraints between the two they weren’t able to communicate effectively. 
 What’s frustrating though is that since then I have tried to call my phone multiple times and the driver has refused to pick up. 
 I have tried reaching out to grab via their helpline but the phone line keeps getting disconnected. I am also unable to sign into my grab account on this second phone as I need Facebook 2FA and the code generator is on my personal phone. 
 Just looking for advice, support, next steps or others who have faced something similar I guess. 
 I’m worried that the phone will eventually die and I will no longer be able to track it and then all hope is lost lol.

 Already there is a language barrier they speak very little English and when I try to use a translator it seems to upset them and they try to communicate with me in small phrases but obviously I lose meaning of what they try to say and they lose meaning of what I try to say.
 So far he has gotten mad at me twice, one for walking upstairs wit my shoes on and another by attempting to contact his wife without going through him.
 At this point I think I’m just culturally missing some elements that he is starting to take as disrespect, I have to talk to them again at their house in a few days and I’m not trying to get cursed out again in Vietnamese pls help.

 How do you respond in Vietnamese when you get compliments appearance wise?
 I'm half Chinese and half Vietnamese living in Europe. In China you don't really say thank you. You just downplay it or deny it playfully.
 I grew up ugly so I never had this encounter but now as an adult I have gotten couple compliments. I just don't know how to answer other than giggling and shaking my head. Thank you for the help. ❤️

 I am visiting HCMC in early June, partially as a vacation but partially to learn more about the local scene for entrepreneurs and freelancers. I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I'm strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.
 As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I'm not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.
 Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats? Anyone here running their own small business or online business in Vietnam and would like to meet for a coffee or beer?
 Thanks for reading!

 Is it similar to other countries like bowling/cinema in bigger cities or is there some more localised activities?
 If anyone has any suggestions for Ninh Binh I'd be very thankful but it just made me think about everywhere else around the country too.

 I have almost 2 years internship experience with multinational corporations on top of my degree. I’m mostly interested in positions involving cloud, DevOps, networking and operating systems, rather than full time software development. 
 How easy would it be for a non Vietnamese graduate to find an entry level position? What would a reasonable monthly wage be? I’ve seen positions ranging from $900-2500, and was wondering what an acceptable range for negotiation would be. Lastly, are there any specific websites I can look for jobs? I’ve currently just been using LinkedIn, Glassdoor and indeed. 
 Thank you in advance for your help 🙏

 Randomly during the day my service will completely stop working. It’ll last for hours before it starts again. I’ve turned off my VPN, restarted my phone, turned on/off airplane mode. Nothing works. 
 Is this common and how do I fix it?

 I recently came across a painting, which I believe is the work of a talented Vietnamese artist. However, the signature on the artwork is a bit tricky to read, and I'm struggling to identify who the artist might be. That's where your expertise comes in! 😄
 Here's the signature:

I told the driver my hotel name and he started driving and then takes me to like four different hotels and each time I say this is not my hotel.
 Finally he asks to use my phone for google maps and I hate handing my phone over but was tired and starting to feel sick. I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn't hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.
 He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn't) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn't even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.
 POLICE are zero help because I don't remember the drivers cab number. Is there ANYTHING I can do? My phone is not showing on the findmyiphone app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I often get these friend requests from attractive looking Vietnamese female profiles on Facebook. Sometimes they are from Vietnam and sometimes they are in the US. They would chat with me and reveal their scam by trying to get me to sell random stuffs for them on some scam sites that give them commissions. I think they themselves believe that those scam sale sites are legit. 
 Another scam is they say they trade options to make money on the side and can help me make money, I never let it go further than that so I don’t know exactly how they do it. However, 90% of them would just chat and talk to me for weeks and months. I entertain them and keep talking to them to see what the scam is but it never comes. I talk to them like a normal respectful person but never show them that I am thirsty. Eventually they just stop talking to me. 
 The one thing in common I noticed is that they would edit old photo posts from months and years ago. Why do this? Is it their way of establishing that the profile is legit because they have posts from years ago? Is there ever a legit reason for someone to edit photos from a couple years ago? I am just trying to understand what is it they want from me or what kind of scam it is because it is a lot of time and efforts they go through. Thank you guys.

 I am always very careful when inputting the pickup address and drop a pin exactly where I am on the map. But when I go to find them I am walking up and down the street and can't see them.
 I have a 4G sim. Am I doing something wrong or is the app location a bit off sometimes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hoping this is the right place to ask - I'm looking for a European based Vietnamese teacher to help me improve my Vietnamese. I lived in Hanoi for a couple of years where my learning was very minimal and since moving back to Europe, I would like to improve my level. 
 I take online lessons but the time zones make it a bit difficult with a teacher based in Vietnam, so it limits my lessons to an hour a week.
 If anyone here knows anyone that would be able to help me, or point me in the right direction, that'd be perfect. They don't need to be a qualified teacher, just someone who I could practice with, and is able to explain about the grammar/pronunciations aspects.
 Thanks in advance!

 Did I create a false memory in my head or something? It's driving me crazy!
 I've been in Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An and Da Lat if that helps. Is it a regional thing?

 Mình cần giúp tìm bài nhạc mà mỗi lần xe tải lùi về là sẽ nghe được. Bài nhạc nghe như “lá la la la là, là lá la la là lá là là la”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I LOVE Vietnamese food and have been indulging in every dish I can find. However, both me and my gf noticed we have extremely smaller appetites here as compared to home (USA).
 I suppose I've been doing slightly less excercisey things (i.e no lifting weights) but we still walk probably a couple miles a day. Plus, I feel like I can go into bottomless pit mode at home when I'm just being a couch potato. 
 Anyone else experience this? For the record, I eat a relatively healthy diet back in the states so I dont think it's due to me consuming less processed foods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Me and my girlfriend are spending a week in Vietnam during the first week of august. I understand this is raining season. While looking for the best places to stay during raining season I came across Cat Ba Island. Beautiful area, less touristy then Halong Bay while still having plenty of restaurant options and other things to do. 
 However, when looking at the weather forecast for august it says there could be monsoons and very heavy rain. Is this still doable or would it be cloudy and raining for most of the day? 
 Other suggestions are also really appreciated!
 Thanks

 There has been a significant increase in the number of Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals, and many of them require oxygen support, especially the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.
 So, should we worry about the new wave of Covid-19?

 I was confused because I always considered it a sort of Pride specially because here in south America as the history of Vietnam has always been a inspiration for us. 
 I'm also quite embarrassed, I have a friend from Vietnam and I've been using this term for a while, well this friend never said anything against it, this is what makes me even more confused.

 Hoping to get recommendations for hospital and costs as well as actual recovery time and follow up appointments.
 As a solo traveller is the recovery something that you can get through on your own? Is it as simple as having a hotel to stay at for the following night and arranging a lift from the hospital back to the hotel?
 What about follow up appointments, I'm not overly keen on staying in HCMC for too long. How about heading to Danang the following day and checking back in at HCMC on the way back to flying out? Were you able to swim and ride a motorbike after the procedure? I think swimming is not recommended. Just wondering what to do in recovery I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have a question about buying a DJI mini 3 pro with the RC and Fly more kit plus in Vietnam. I'll be visiting the country in about a month and I'm wondering how much it would cost to buy this product in a local store. Unfortunately, I cannot order it from the official DJI site because I'll be moving around a lot.
 Can anyone recommend the best stores to go to for purchasing this drone in Vietnam? Also, I'm a bit concerned about the legality of flying drones in Vietnam. What happens if the police catch you with a drone? Is it illegal to fly drones in certain areas of the country?
 Thank you for your help and advice in advance. I'm really looking forward to my trip to Vietnam and I'd love to capture some amazing footage with my new drone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 My fiancée and I are planning to take a trip out to Nha Ttrang in September/October. My company does not give me much vacation time - only 3 weeks a year - so for this trip, I am only looking to spend about 7-ish days in VietNam, with a few of them specifically in Nha Trang.
 I make a fairly good income at my job - just shy over $100K USD - and I'm not reluctant to spend $130-$180 a night at a nice hotel with my fiancée. Unfortunately we are in the process of waiting for a Visa, so do not see one another that frequently. My fiancée doesn't care too much about fancy accommodations since she grew up fairly frugal, but I don't mind spending the extra $$ because I'm a little spoiled.
 Anyways, what is everyone's favourite luxury hotel in Nha Trang? We we will be taking a flight from HCM. The 40-50min drive from the airport isn't a deal breaker, so the hotel does not necessarily need to be in a convenient in-between location from airport and the night market.
 We've looked up a few spots already; Queen Ann, Ariyana SmartCondotel, and Panorama by HLG.
 The biggest thing I'm looking for is a comfortably-sized shower for additional intimacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Vietnamese friends told me that Vietnam has a high HIV rate. Drug users use needles and infect each other with HIV. Then they have sex with hookers which spreads more HIV. Customers that see hookers spread HIV to their wives etc. Is this true? 
 HIV rate in Vietnam seems very high compare to South Korea or Japan. Let me know what you think as a local Vietnamese. 
 (Vietnam also has a high cancer rate but I'll make another thread on that)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to hear thoughts of those outside of western worlds.
 Australia getting pretty grim with high interest rates and corporate owned houses for renting, rich boomer generation buying multiple houses to rent out and rich overseas investors buying 5+ houses to rent out. A lot more homeless around nowadays. 
 But our salaries are alright, even a waiter can afford a house if we save good for 3-5 years, we could probably get a mortgage that will take a life time to pay off.
 I went over to vietnam and found out that salaries can be 250k to 500k VND, depending on location. But the property prices are equivalent to USA and Aus. 
 Not everyone will have corporate jobs or be in a financial situation to afford these prices.
 How is it looking for those who are starting from scratch? No family to assist, just a normal everyday job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 After searching the subreddit, I've seen several questions about short layovers in HCMC (5-6 hours max). Most of the consensus I've read is that Tan Son Nhat makes that short of a stopover risky, and best to stay in the airport. However, in June I'll be flying in on my way back to Australia and I'll have 10 hours of stopover time from landing to the next departure.
 I already went ahead and got a visa, so that should speed things up. If I factor in 30 min to 1 hour for customs, another 30 minutes or so into the city centre via taxi, and then 30 min to get back to the airport 3 whole hours before my international departure, that still leaves me with potentially 5 hours in HCMC. Worth it in my book! I never thought I'd get to set foot in Vietnam so I'm excited to take the opportunity.
 Where's the best area to wander for 5-ish hours in HCMC? Try some local Vietnamese dishes, get a bit of a sense of what the city is like, any quick interesting sights, etc. I'll be there on a Friday if that makes a difference for any markets or things that will be open.
 Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was the 3rd Mongol invasion of Vietnam, along the Bạch Đằng river. The Viets positioned themselves in small flotilla along the river, and made a false retreat drawing the Mongol fleet into the trap.With the Yuan fleet trapped, the Vietnamese junks armed with bombs, attacked them from all sides. Many of the Mongols jumped into the river to save themselves were killed or drowned. The Viet captured around 400 Yuan warships.
 This victory effectively put an end to the Mongol invasions of Vietnam, though the Viet monarch Trần Nhân Tông, decided to accept the supremacy of Kublai Khan to avoid further conflicts.The failure of the Mongol invasions was however a shattering blow for their supremacy in Asia, and Vietnam's success gave more confidence to the other Asian nations to halt the once invincible Mongol juggernaut.

I experienced that when I landed in Hanoi in late October 2022. The arrival hall was totally packed. About an hour until I got through.
 I’m wondering if anyone has experience arriving in Da Nang instead. I looked around online and there isn’t much in the way of comments about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Base on a article on “Tuoitre” According to the explanation of the Chairman of Hoi An City Nguyen Van Son, the revenue from entrance tickets serves the conservation, embellishment and restoration of monuments, renovating the infrastructure in the old quarter, and organizing events. tourism events, as well as supporting people in home renovation and renovation, etc. At the same time, it is compulsory to buy tickets for all visitors when visiting Hoi An ancient town to ensure fairness for the locality and visitors. 
 Ticket prices are issued at 120,000 VND/ticket for international visitors and 80,000 VND/ticket for domestic visitors. Such a two-price policy that distinguishes between domestic and foreign people, dating back several decades, is completely out of line with international practices. 
 There are two types of spaces that need to be clearly defined, where the proposed toll is public space or owned space (eg museums, monuments...). If the space is owned, the owner has the right to collect a fee. On the contrary, if it is a public space, it belongs to the whole people, belongs to everyone, and has no right to collect fees. 
 Hoi An sells entrance tickets, in the case of legality, on the one hand, it brings the city's budget but on the other hand increases the cost of tourists.
 I strongly think this is a step back for Hoi An tourism some Comment I ever read even said don’t turn “Hội An” to “Hội Ăn”

 I want songs with Vietnamese lyrics, but in another style. Rock & Pop-Rock are my preferred genres. Fast, upbeat! And I don't care what the lyrics say as long as they are in Vietnamese. 
 Artists/Projects I like: Kagerou Project, Weezer, Wallows, Sex Bob-Omb 
 Please do recommend me something!!! Thank you :D

 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

 I feel weak.
 I realize my nutrition levels are low. 
 I do not speak Vietnamese. 
 Since I am eating Vietnamese food only
 So I need to seek a registered dietician in Vietnam to discuss a nutrition plan and diet. 
 If I seek a registered dietician in the west, they might not be familir with the food here. 
 Are there good English-speaking registered dieticians in Vietnam that can help me with a nutrition plan and diet? 
 Thanks!

 I do not have time to cook my food.
 I just go to cheap shops or street food.
 In the street, I see them offering food like rice, fish, chicken, etc.
 When I walk in the street, I just eat the food. 
 In the English speaking Countries, it is not recommend to eat outside due to how processed and expensive the food it is.
 Here in Vietnam, the food is so cheap. However, is the food healthy? Do they use cheap oil to cook? Do they use a lot of oil?
 Thanks!

 I recently moved to Hanoi, Vietnam, to start a new chapter here. I love this place so much but I find myself often confused on how many options I have for grocery shopping, and it got me thinking about where could I find the best prices of groceries in spite of being a foreigner. I have got some names of some supermarkets but I was wondering If I could go even cheaper to buy groceries. If anyone here has any idea I would really appreciate it and hopefully others coming to Vietnam can benefit from this post if someone drops any value here.
 Thank you and have a nice day

 Being from the UK, I can’t say I’ve had much actual experience with what Falun Gong is beyond the whole China situation, which as you can imagine often attracts a lot of negativity and general bad feeling. 
 I’m wondering how Falun Gong is actually viewed by Vietnamese people. I’m guessing given the amount of times I’ve come across practitioners, it’s viewed more favourably than it is in the UK or other places.

Her family apparently follows Cao Dai. She herself says she has no religion, though she is quite interested in Buddhist philosophy and often reads Buddhist-flavored self-help books (like Thich Nhat Hanh and Haemin Sunim).
 Anyway, she's incredibly kind, fun-loving, philosophical, selfless, and more. I'm just wondering whether coming from a family that follows Cao Dai is like the Vietnamese equivalent of a Mormon family, a Scientology family, or really just no big deal? Is there anything I should be aware of?

For additional context, He is a city guy and I’m more of a nature and landscape gal. We both like water. So based on that I was curious which itinerary anyone would anyone recommend in mid October taking into account the central region rainy season. We also want to ensure we have the most sun/best warm weather in the islands.
 I’m not sure on the amount of days yet in each place so any recommendations are welcome :) also are there any “must see” places I am missing that would fit into the below with the amount of time we have? Thank you!! 
 Itinerary 1 Land in Hanoi-> Sapa-> Halong Bay -> hoian? (Not sure if I should avoid due to rain) Fly to Ho Chi Minh -> Phu Quoc islands then back to Ho Chi Minh to fly home 
 Itinerary 2 Land in Hochiminh -> Phu Quoc islands -> back to Ho Chi Minh-> fly to Hanoi -> Sapa -> Halong bay -Hanoi and any day trips from there then fly home from Hanoi

 Next question, I understand that tab water in Hanoi is not clean enough to drink and that there was even an scandal in 2019. Since I drink a lot of water, try to avoid plastic bottles and will stay around four years, I'm considering buying a more heavy duty purifier, such as the Bluewater Spirit. https://www.bluewatergroup.com/product/bluewater-spirit/
 Does anyone have experience using such products in Hanoi/Vietnam? Or are there better local options? Thanks!

I'd preferably want there to be two capitals, the western capital and the eastern capital, The western capital could be either Sylhet or Chittagong (Chattogram) and the eastern capital could be either Bangkok or Hanoi. I personally think that it would be great. I mean, look at India, it has different cultures and languages/language-families (Indo-European, Dravidian etc.).. I want these countries that I mentioned to be one country for the greater good (of humanity). Even if they were to merge, they would not be as big in size as China, India or the USA but they would be bigger in size than as they are presently.These countries that I mentioned are all connected by land, not just the water (for some more context, for those reading and looking to get it). If anyone else on here who sees this also wants this to happen, please feel free to give some suggestions and let's gather some ideas on seeing if this could actually go forth.
 P.S.: I haven't thought of a name for the proposed country yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all I want to say after spending 2 of my 3 weeks in Vietnam so far it's been great. I have spent time all over the country and have been to Ho Chi Minh, Da Lat, Nha Trang, Da Nang and Hoi An. Every city have had its unique feeling and I have loved it so far.
 Now I'm finally in Ha Long, this was supposed to be the real tropical paradise stop with beaches and swimming. Boating through the unique Islands in the bay and just relax before going to Hanoi for the flight back home. 
 I decided to go on a bot trip while in Ha Long and just enjoy the almost mystical atmosphere you get boating through the bay between hundreds of small rocky islands.But this absolutely broke my heart, instead of a mystical and paradise like environment we got nothing but waters absolutely full of trash. 
 It didn't matter where you looked, it was just full of mostly styrofoam blocks and other plastic waste, but also some random wood and other garbage also floating around. And I'm not surprised that the waters are so littered, there where hundreds of tourist boats in the bay at any given time. Unfortunately this seem to partly be because of over tourism in the bay, and going through Ha Long city there seem to be alot of relatively new developments but 70% of it looked to be empty or abandoned. 
 I am just a tourist that get to see this city for a limited time, can anyone from the area tell me more about how you perceive the city's and they bays development over the past few years. And if you have toured Ha Long just as me and have similar or very contrasting experiences, please share. 
 Love from Sweden 🇸🇪

Maybe people here can recommend any accurate and good documentaries? I will for sure still make my own research and not watch the first recommended one! Hope this sensitive topic doesn’t offend or hurt anyone here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be spending nearly 3 weeks in Vietnam starting later this month and want to buy an eSIM before I go. It sounds like Viettel has by far the best service, especially to more remote areas where I'll be going. I'd like to buy a tourist eSIM directly from Viettel and found their site https://tourist.viettel.vn/ . Looks like I have to provide a lot of personal information (including passport photo) before they provide details. Anyone have experience with buying directly from this site? I wanted to check before I provide my personal info. Thanks!

Or that i should have a little bow when greeting someone. Anything else like this that might be uncommon for me, an european, but is customs in Vietnam? I am asking because i want to respect the people i will meet when visit this country, and want to make sure i also follow their customs as a gratitude for welcoming me in their country! Thank you!

Now we have got our 30 day visa, but the stamp in the passport says, that we have to leave Vietnam at the 12th April. We want to leave it at the 24th. Then we stayed here 28 days in total. Is it now possible, to expand the permission to stay with our visum without traviling outside of vietnam? Maybe at the immigration office in Hanoi? Has everyone tried that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am *thinking* about taking an extended backpacing trip through Vietnam. I have never backpacked before so tbh I’m not even sure what that means. I am looking for any and all advice as I formulate my plan of travel. 
 Budgeting; if I am trying to keep it mid to low cost how much can I expect to pay per day? I found some posts that said 50$ a day would be sufficient if I stay in hostels, hitchhike, and take the bus places. (That was including lodging). Does this hold true?
 Things to do: as I have no idea what Vietnam is like i plan to soak up as much as possible. I’m told any and all caves are worth a visit. Is there anyone out there who has been to Vietnam before and is willing to share or send me their itinerary? I can taylor it to my needs but i would be forever greatful to you kind stranger. 
 If I want to travel to a different country after Vietnam has anyone had experience applying for a multi trip visa? (Google can probably answer that one for me but there’s nothing better than first hand knowledge).
 Any and all wisdom is greatly appreciated. I plan to Only bring a 40-50L backpack too. Is this feesable.? Experienced backpackers, any pointers on what I should pack and how many of each item? I tend to over pack so I would probably do 2 weeks worth of clothes if I can fit it in the backpack but if someone is able to get away with less then i‘d happily pack lighter.

He honked and honked. While trying to pass us, the other car hit our side mirror. I could look into the other car and saw a young man in a military uniform looking very angry at us, like we were the inconvenience to him. After he passed by, I could see a red colored license plate. If I am not mistaken, that plate belongs to the military and is ranked the highest among other plates. After complaining to other people that an officer does not adhere to the law, they told me that those people ARE the law. Even normal police officers couldn’t do anything about it.

 Some details about us: I am a foreigner and she is Vietnamese. We have been together for 7 years. We went broke together and came out of it doing well now. We have been through sickness (somewhat) and are in health. We use to fight about trivial matters and misunderstandings due to the language barrier but we learned to communicate better and rarely ever fight nowadays. We also have a daughter together and we are about to achieve our dream of owning our own house very soon. 
 Can you recommend me any Vietnamese love songs with lyrics or meaning similar to Bon Jovi's "Thank you for loving me"? 
 Really appreciate it!

 I'm a student from VN currently living in the U.S. and my VN passport is nearing expiration so I have to renew it via mail. I looked at the embassy website and they said to submit a processing fee but didn't specify how much. I tried to reach them by their regular phone number and email (no one answered/voicemail was full), and when I finally got through the hotline the guy who picked up just got mad at me lol. If you have experience applying for passport renewal recently please share how you did it/how much it cost. Thanks in advance!

 Long story short, the hotel where I am going to stay in Hanoi in November gave me some good deals for a 2-day/1-night cruise on one of the ships mentioned in the title. The problem is that I can't seem to figure out which one to choose...
 Le Theatre has a great dinner place with a piano and good outdoor areas on top, but I have seen comments about degradation problems and it not being very clean.
 Scarlet Pearl seems to be very new and clean, but it may have fewer outdoor areas...
 As for the itinerary, I think both are equivalent.
 Which one do you guys think I should choose?
 Thanks! 😁

When we go out to eat, should I order my own food or just let him order and ask for extra plates?
 I have several mental health issues and my child is autistic. I am high functioning, receive mental health services, work full time and have full custody of my kids. I know it’s not appropriate to discuss emotions in many Asian cultures but I feel like it’d be the right thing to do to bring it up eventually. How should I do this? Should I be prepared for him to see me as weak and leave?
 What’s the best way to show him I care? My love language is touch but I wouldn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable in public. Would it be acceptable make a dessert for him? 
 What else do I need to know?
  
Thank you!!!

 We have spent two days here and have decided to abandoned ship and move on with the rest of the country. The main reason is that there is not much to do, and nowhere worth going to eat. 
 It obviously depends on what you like, but if it includes meat, you wont be getting that. Almost all meat here is not what it is advertised as, and will likely destroy your stomach the next day. We spent hours researching restaurants to eat at and compared to the rest of Vietnam, they are really quite pathetic. 4.7-5 star reviews on many restaurant are just an absolute joke. 
 Da Lat is a picturesque city with a nice climate this time of year. The hotels are all a bit tired and run down but that is to be expected considering the location. There are some nice bars hidden away for people to discover and you can do some small touristy activities like Crazy House, Coaster, Bike trips but that's about it. 
 It is interesting that there are not many honest reviews containing criticism of any places in this country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[seeing as vietnamese has so many loanwords from french colonization, albeit with differences ofc in spelling and pronunciation, do you think a vietnamese speaker would have an easier time learning french than say, a japanese speaker, due to the linguistic influences? (for example sa bông for savon, etc) would some vocabulary or language be recognizable or instinctual, or not at all? anyone here who speaks or is learning both, do you find similarities in the two languages?

 Do you think Vietnam will be rich like Singapore or South Korea? Why or why not?
 As a white American, I think Vietnam has the potential to get rich but not too fast please.
 Edit: thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been living here for over a year now and I'm curious to know what are some recommended insurance plans that other Americans use that won't break the bank. When I first came here I had world nomads, but they turned out to be no good after I was hospitalised and didn't plan on returning home anytime back to the states. They said that exempt me from getting my claim. Then I had Safetywing but they are more of a (you pay now and file a claim and we will send you the money later) kind of deal. I'm living in HCMC and am just looking for a good insurance plan I can rely on if I do get injured and I can just go to the hospital (Probably Vinmec) and just get helped on the spot no questions asked. Can anyone give me any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm Vietnamese and I've eaten Nem Chua all my life and I've recently realized that Lao and Thai people have a very similar raw fermented Sausage that is called Naem. Is this a cognate where the word (possibly origin?) comes from the same source or is a coincidence? Vietnamese considers a lot of "sausage meat" related food "Nem" like in Nem Nuong and Nem Ran and I'm not sure if Thai and Lao people consider other meat Nem/Naem like in Vietnamese. I've done some research and fermented sausage eaten raw is unique to South East Asia so it would make sense if they come from a similar origin somewhere in South East Asia as opposed to the cooked Lap Xuong that comes from China.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody! 
 ​
 In May, I have a flight that will have a 6 hour layover in Ho Chi Minh airport.
 ​
 I was wondering if anybody could tell me if this would be enough time to at least visit the city center or some interesting areas nearby the airport or if this is not enough.
 ​
 I'm traveling on a Mexican Passport so I would need to process an E-Visa which is 25 USD, which is not a problem at all but if it's not even enough time to visit the outsides I would rather just transit in the airport.
 ​
 Thank you all!

This includes towns, cities, gyms, and The Elite Four. I came here because people on this subreddit know more about Vietnam than me. I take inspiration from other cultures in my writing so I can learn more about said cultures, and I don't wanna accidentally offend anyone. If anyone has suggestions on what elements of Vietnam would work well in my Pokemon story, please comment them down below!
 Here are the gyms and elite four:
 Gyms:
 Gym 1: Poison
 Gym 2: Psychic
 Gym 3: Electric
 Gym 4: Ground
 Gym 5: Normal
 Gym 6: Rock
 Gym 7: Dragon
 Gym 8: Steel

 Elite Four:

 Elite 2: Grass
 Elite 3: Fighting
 Elite 4: Fairy

 Me and my girlfriend are planning to visit your beautiful country this September. Probably from end of August till mid-September.
 However, I have found out that during this time Vietnam experiences relatively a lot of rain in some parts of the country. 
 We planned to visit Hanoi, Sapa, Ha long Bay, Ninh Binh, Hoi an, Hue and Phu quoc. Now I have read mixed information in the internet, so I thought I would ask maybe a local or someone who already visited Vietnam during this time period. Is end of August till mid-September a good time to visit these locations or which should I eventually skip?

 Ban đầu em có dự tính thi vào thiết kế đồ họa (em thích ngành này từ năm lớp 9) nhưng mà nghĩ lại và nghe mọi người khuyện nhủ thì em lại đang khá phân vân, liệu mình chọn ngành này sau này thu nhập có ổn định không, có đủ để gửi tiền hàng tháng về cho bố mẹ được không...có lẽ em thích là một chuyện nhưng nếu sau này ra trường lương lại ít hơn số tiền bỏ ra thì em thấy có lỗi với bố mẹ lắm ạ..
 Em đang phân vân giữa kiến trúc, ,thiết kế đồ họa, thiết kế nội thất. Ba ngành này em học ngành nào cũng được và sẽ quyết tâm đến cùng ( em có thế mạnh về vẽ và Toán Lý, biết sử dụng pts)
 Mọi người tư vẫn cho em với ạ
 em cảm ơn🌹

I’m planning to live in HCMC and look for a English teaching job soon. I’m fluent in English and Vietnamese (just can’t read or write) I’m open to meeting different people. I can be wholesome and also party(although i have slowed down in my late 20s) I’ve traveled from the south up north 3 years ago so I’m familiar with the landscape. Did the whole backpacking thing already. My interest includes art, tattooing, fishing, motorcycles, tech, music, traveling. I’m pretty open minded just looking for some new friends(usually more extroverted) but just been with family. If you’re chill respectful and have decent morals I’m free to meet up.

 I've noticed, every year is getting more and more difficult, especially at public schools. I teach at a talent school every day, and I constantly face problems with discipline and respect.
 I've been through students saying "Fuck you, teacher", students showing me the middle finger, students talking back to me in a disrespectful way and the latest, being called đần. My name is Aidan, so during breaktime, a student decided to write Aiđần on my pencil case while I wasn't in the class. 
 These days, I just feel a complete lack of respect from students and Vietnamese teachers. I know foreign teachers get paid a lot more than Vietnamese teachers, …]]></summary>

 I want to know if it is appropriate to mention, or talk about my interest in engaged buddhism and Thich Nhat Hanhs work in the work place, particularly in education field/working with children? (or just in general)
 Is he a figure that is respected by Vietnamese people? Or will I get judged or looked at differently after mentioning my interest in his books and values? Might it be offensive to mention? I also don’t want to offend anyone!!
 I know this is a very very generalized statement, but it’s something I have been thinking about a lot, especially when learning about Thays history with the Vietnamese government etc.
 Thank you so much in advance!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! This summer, I'll move to Hanoi (from Rome) for a four-year diplomatic posting. I'm super excited to explore Hanoi and the rest of Vietnam and have a few questions that you can hopefully help me answer.
  
Are there any essentials that are hard to get by in Hanoi? My employer will arrange a moving company, so I have the option of stashing up in Rome before the move. 
 
Where should I live? I am looking for a neighbourhood with a good connection to the Old Quarter for my daily commute (see Q3). I'm coming alone and would prefer an area with a local vibe that is relatively quiet and clean. My employer pays for my accommodation so fortunately I have a wider choice budget wise. 
 
Is my e-bike enough or should I buy a scooter? I currently own a VanMoof S3 with a top speed of roughly 30 km/h.
 
I have the opportunity of following two weeks of full-time language classes. Can you recommend any schools? A school slightly outside of Hanoi with room and board is possible too. 
 
How to get social? I am no noob to making new friends in new environments, but any tips are very welcome!
 
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found Vietnamese businesses like restaurants and coffee shops abroad to be really unfriendly. On several occasions we went inside a Vietnamese restaurant and were completely ignored. So when we finally went on vacation to Vietnam, we were not expecting much in terms of customer service...
 However in Vietnam the customer service turned out to be fantastic! Restaurants and coffee shop workers were really friendly. Hostel owners would treat you like family. Even tiny food stall owners were super kind. Locals would help you order food and give you suggestions. It was really like some kind of Customer Service Fairy Tale
 Then I came back from the vacation, and decided to go to a Vietnamese coffee shop. The cashier didn't say anything at all when I ordered.
 I'm just wondering why there is such a huge discrepancy in customer service between businesses in Vietnam and abroad

 Amazing. And they stack so nicely!

 A lot of the articles I read seem to put more emphasis on Len Dong / spirit mediumship happening in the North but also with a handful of practitioners in diaspora like in California of the US who have been trained or came into the role through heredity (e.g. family has a history of it).
 For Ca Ong/whale worship, a lot of coastal villages including the one part of my family came from still do it, but we're disconnected from the culture due to deaths in the family and immigration away from the country. And it seems each village celebrates their festival differently at different moons (TraVinh where some of my relatives were from for example is supposedly on the 3rd lunar month, others do the 6th), and some blend Buddhist traditions with the mourning of a deceased whale, while others remain rooted in Cham culture, and others potentially adopted the Nguyen Dynasty's official policies to worship Can Ong but kept their own local practices too.
 So I'm wondering what the ceremonies and protocols are like, and if the two religions ever overlap, what the ceremonies entail, and what route might be good to inquire further to connect with first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I’m of Vietnamese ancestry, but was born in the United States, and have lived there all my life. However, I visit Vietnam for holiday periodically, and after hearing my (limited) Vietnamese skills, I’m often asked by locals: “Are you Viet Kieu?”
 It seems like a simple question, but I’ve received different answers from locals, relatives, and the internet. To make it more confusing, the meaning seems to have change from older to younger generations. Can you help?
 Is Viet Kieu: - someone born in Vietnam that now lives overseas - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry who now wishes to live in Vietnam again?
 And more importantly (for me)…does Viet Kieu have a bad connotation for locals?
 Thanks for your help!
 Edit: Added small detail for clarity. And wow, thank you for all the thoughtful responses.

Or anyone that had an experience where they started solo but met people along the way to drive with.

 Is this a thing in Vietnam?

 Are there any YouTube channels, books, or articles—any learning materials—that teach the ignorant (me) about Vietnamese religious traditions?
 My partner and I are raising our child here (2 years old currently), and we want them to be as understanding as possible of the Vietnamese religious traditions. We’d even like to put up a family altar if we can figure out how to do it right.

We are planning to send her to international school and since we want to live near her school, it seems as our two options will be D2 or D7. These aren’t the neighborhoods I would pick but we want to live near the school to make commuting less annoying. We are having a hard time deciding between the two and would love any insight! 
 What are the nice apt buildings in D7 in the Phú Mỹ Hưng area? Some of the buildings in D2 had such nice facilities and landscaping and I am struggling to find something comparable in D7. We’d like a building that’s lively, lots of kids.
 What I love about D1, 2, 3 are the cute coffee shops and small stores. And the street food. D7 doesn’t seem to have any of that, right? Just wanna make sure I’m not missing something…
 Not sure if anyone on this subreddit is a parent but would love to know if the families in D2 and D7 are younger families or older and more established with lots of kids?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any backpacker/traveler who is planning to travel across VN and needs a local as a guide/translator, then I'm willing to be yours. Since my main purpose in doing this is to practice my English, I won't require any charge from you. But I have to make it clear that I'll need you to cover all the travel expenses such as food, and accommodation fees on the way for me, because I'm quite broke now and can't afford to pay those. And in return, being a local I have experience about what to avoid while being in the country, as I'm familiar with the law and many other things here, as well as knowing which places are cheap and safe, which are overpriced, and which services are good and which scams to avoid.
 I don't mind traveling by motorbike, for I have one of my own. so feel free to reach out and DM me :) I'm currently living in Ha Long, a tourist coastal city located 150km to the east of Hanoi. If you are visiting or planning to visit my city, we can also meet and befriend and I will show you around if you're interested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My family is buying property just outside of HCMC. This property is so that my in-laws can retire back to Vietnam. We need to send just over 100K USD from the USA. Wiring/bank transfer of the money would be our safest bet I am assuming. If this is the case, will I be able to open a bank account in Vietnam with only a family visa? I am not able to get Vietnam citizenship reinstated. However my wife is, and she is currently waiting on the paper work to be finished. The property will be the in-law’s name. So I am not worried about loosing said property. Next question that I have is once money is in hand, in Vietnam, what is normally done/happens to transfer the title? Is it a red flag if a newly built condo does not have the red book,title? I was told that this is because the condo was recently built and at this time all units are not sold or finished yet. Though I do know that people have been living in that building for ả least 5 years. One would think that my in-laws would be able to answer these questions. But they have been living outside of Vietnam for 40 years. And I have no close relative alive in Vietnam to ask. Please excuse any poor wording or grammatical errors. Writing coherently in is still a struggle.

I am already prepared that i can’t cycle back on Sunday. I was thinking is it possible to bring a bicycle on a local bus back to Hanoi? I’ve taken the local bus 71 before also and it got quite full that time. I could also use a taxi but i heard it would cost over 1mil VND and im thinking what would be most convinient way.
 Thank you in advance! 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[- Many motorcyclists don't wear a helmet, especially during rush hour, and traffic police just ignore them, and they even pass right next to them.
 - Many will turn right or left at the foot of a bridge, even cars. What's worse, there are vendors on a freaking bridge!
 - Being on the phone while driving or riding. Worse, texting!
 - Cutting corners is a very common practice. 
 - Double parking, particularly in narrow streets.
 - The most dangerous, I think, is beating the red light, especially without a helmet.
 ​
 I hope the government will have stricter traffic regulations. These situations appear to be everywhere, at least, in where I live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I've been creating a playlist on Spotify with music from Southeast Asia, including both traditional and more recently recorded songs. I wanted to kindly ask you for any songs, artists, or records you would recommend me to add to the playlist. 
 I am grateful for any suggestions - except maybe noisy EDM or cheesy mainstream pop! :p It doesn't matter from which Southeast Asian nation the music is from, I prefer explore songs that are sung in a native language, though, and not in English - if the music even includes voice recordings. 
 Regarding music which has been released in recent decades, I do particularly enjoy indie rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and post punk, among many other genres.
 When it comes to traditional/older recordings, I appreciate to explore basically everything! =) 
 So, many thanks for any recommendations in advance! ;) Here's a link to the playlist if someone's interested in listening to it, too:

 I recently bought a few houseplants, such as the one in the photo. I have no idea what kind if plant it is, just that it is not doing so well. The leaves are turning brown and dropping off. 
 I've had it for about 2 months, and kept it inside our apartment, watering every few days so that the soil doesn't completely dry out. I've moved it outside as I thought it might need more sunlight, but it still is struggling.
 Any tips please? I hav no idea on how to care for plants in tropical climates. Also, what is this plant called?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm considering visiting Hanoi and scoping out how accessible it might be for someone in a manual wheelchair who'd like to avoid driving. I currently live in Yosemite National Park as its only employee in a wheelchair, so I'm used to standards below what's technically legal in U.S. cities, and am used to having difficulty with transportation, groceries, etc. I have some specific questions, but in general I'd really appreciate some perspective from people with mobility impairments of any kind. Examples of commentary I'd find very useful:
 Do expats see many disabled people among middle class society?
 Are we treated differently in ways that are negative?
 Would I have a harder time getting or maintaining a job because of a visible disability? (Will I be discriminated against more than I already am in the U.S.?)
 Would it be difficult to find an apartment that's more or less accessible without it being considered a luxury or additional spending requirement?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, I'm going to HCMC and will be meeting my Vietnamese girlfriend (who lives with her parents).
 I'd like to stay near District 1 but it's my understanding most hotels won't let her visit by law because we're not married. She says it's probably fine and she can talk to the desk and tell them she's actually my GF to smooth it over but won't research ahead of time for me which is frustrating since she's so confident this will work anywhere (internet tells me otherwise).
 I found some sites listing "girl friendly" hotels, but they all look pretty dumpy (what you'd expect for that crowd).
 Does anyone know any decent 4-star or so hotels in District 1 that would allow her? I've started to email some places in the meantime. Budget is around $75-150USD/night which should be plenty. I'd like to not stay in a rundown brothel which many of the places that allow guests seem to resemble.
 Thanks!

She has to go from Da Nang to Hue, looked on Da Nang's airport site for recommendations, does anyone here have any others? I saw Grab mentioned, but she barely knows how to use her smartphone, so that may be out. She also has quite a bit of luggage and two other individuals coming along ,so a large van will be needed. Is there anything I could do on my end (U.S.) to book something? Or just give her one of these numbers? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps it's just me, but this is the direct experience I've had whilst living in Hanoi for the last 4 months. I have my local vinmart, and another vinmart down the road and a circle k. I have to say, my experience of customer service has been the worst I have ever experienced. At the one store, the same girl (in her late 20's), just looks at me and has this look of contempt, of anger almost, grabs my items, scans them then points to the screen in a really 'I can't be bothered, hurry up' way. She grabs my card scans it, prints the receipt and just hands it to me, not even a smile, a nod, a goodbye, no eye contact. The other day she takes the basket and just throws it on the floor. Then again, tonight, the other store, I go in, the young man didn't say one word to me the entire time. No hello, no thank you, no goodbye (in Vietnamese.. I don't expect English)... And just slammed the receipt on the table and continued chatting. My question is, are these people taught by their companies to observe any form of customer service? Is it because they are shy? (even though they stare at me and even once sighed at me for taking too long to use my phone app to pay even though their card machine wasn't working)? Is it because they have no idea what to say to foreigners? Because I've been to other countries and a simple head nod, or even small gesture to acknowledge the customer and make him or her feel welcome isn't so difficult is it? Now I rather hate going shopping now. It is not an enjoyable situation and I'm wondering if anyone else has the same experience in Hanoi. As a customer spending money in these stores I feel entitled to some form of customer service. I dont expect much, but a simple xin Chào, cam on or even a smile to the foreigners who are living and working hard here (or even tourists spending their money here) isn't so difficult... Or is it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Met a guy in his late 40’s from Vietnam this weekend and I’m trying to figure out how to spell his name. Over the phone I had no idea I wasn’t speaking to an American and heard Jim and didn’t think anything of it. When we met in person I realized he was of Asian descent and when I heard him say his name I realized it wasn’t Jim. 
 The best I could describe his name would be how the English word “You” would sound with an “M” at the end, Youm. He said it’s pretty common for people mistake it for Jim. But I’m having trouble figuring out how his name is actually spelled. 
 I’m hoping this is a common enough name that I could easily get an answer here. Thank you in advance.

Mắm tôm and similar should not be an option because I need to make sure I can check it on the airplane.
 
We usually use it to dip BBQ meats. Usually venison during hunting season or beef or pork ribs.
 
Great if I can order it online. I don't live in HCMC but occasionally get there for a day or two.
 
 As for myself, what do you suggest for a very hot/spicy sauce? For me even the Cholimex "tương ớt cay nồng" is not very spicy though it's almost there.

 I am interested in moving to Vietnam and working for a year. I have quite sensitive health problems, blepharitis and quite serious eczema; right now I have them both fairly under control but am quite concerned that the pollution will cause it to flair.
 Ideally, I want to move to Hanoi, but am also considering Saigon as I heard it's better air .I fear the air might affect my health problems. I would happily buy an air filter, mask, and try my best to avoid rush hour.
 Am I worrying too much? Is a year short enough to be relatively safe?
 What are your experiences, thank you!

 "Cả 5 nữ tiếp viên đều bị tạm giữ. Sau đó, cơ quan điều tra tại TP.HCM cho phép gia đình bảo lãnh để họ được về nhà. Tuy nhiên, cả 5 người vẫn phải phối hợp điều tra khi có yêu cầu", nguồn tin cho hay. 
 Như Dân Việt đưa tin, sáng 16/3, chuyến bay VN10 từ Pháp vừa đáp xuống Cảng hàng không quốc tế Tân Sơn Nhất, cán bộ hải quan đã khám xét hành lý của 4 nữ tiếp viên. 
 Cán bộ hải quan tại cửa khẩu sân bay quốc tế Tân Sơn Nhất đã phát hiện dấu hiệu bất thường trong hành lý của 4 tiếp viên Vietnam Airlines. 
 Qua sàng lọc, soi chiếu, hải quan nghi vấn vali của đoàn tiếp viên có chất cấm nên chuyển sang kiểm tra trực tiếp, tìm thấy tổng cộng hơn 8kg thuốc lắc và hơn 3kg ketamine, cocain.

 Having professional photos taken
 Anything else?

The bus was just shaky, the bus driver drove like a maniac, honking all the time, slammed on the breaks a lot and sending me flying off my seat a few times. I eventually ended up getting a headache, dizziness and just couldn’t sleep without worrying that this bus was gonna crash or something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I (21M) was born in 2001 in HCMC Vietnam and my mother's side originated from the HCMC region whilst my father's side originated from the North (he was born in Hanoi by the way). Even though both my parents, both my sisters (33F, 21F), and I have visited Hanoi several times, most of my mother's side has never visited North Vietnam yet (north of 17th parallel), despite the fact most of her relatives still live in Vietnam (from what I have heard from my mother, her side is quite wealthy and many of her relatives are business owners). Many of them only went around the Southern third of Vietnam and the furthest North many of them has visited is Nha Trang/Dalat. In fact, for all of my mother's relatives in the US (most came during the mid-late 1990s), none of them went above Nha Trang and half of them only visited Vietnam once or twice afterwards.
 Despite the fact I have only lived in Vietnam for 5 years before moving to Russia to study in 2006 and subsequently moving to the US at 11 in 2012, I have visited Vietnam several times afterwards (my most recent trip was in 2019 by the way), and I have visited the following places:
 Ca Mau, Can Tho, Long Xuyen, Ben Tre, Vung Tau, HCMC, Tay Ninh, Phan Thiet, Dalat, Nha Trang, Buon Ma Thuot, Tuy Hoa, Quy Nhon, Pleiku, Quang Ngai, Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Vinh, Thanh Hoa, Nam Dinh, Hanoi, Hai Duong, Haiphong, Ha Long, Thai Nguyen, Sapa
 ​
  
I am curious if it is common for Vietnamese people to have never visited the Northern half (North of 16/17 parallel)
 Plus, how common is it for Vietnamese Americans to never return to Vietnam or only return there once since moving to the US

 Last question, when Vietnamese people go to the shops and they "chuyển khoản", do they mean paying with a card or is that some other way of paying that I don't know?

On the fence about Ha Long Bay. The thought of it is exciting, and seems like a bucket list thing, but not sure if a 1 night cruise will be enjoyable if the bay is overcrowded. 
 Are there 5 star cruises there that take a less crowded route?
 We don't care so much about spending the night on the boat but seems like that is the standard way to enjoy it.
 I hear there are other bays nearby but that they are not any less crowded.
 Tips?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào!
 I am visiting Hanoi from now until friday, the 31st of april, and I am interested in getting a custom tailored mens suit! I just want a jacket and pants, but if the price is good I could be convinced to get a shirt and/or vest too. I am thinking of choosing a charcoal wool/wool blend material.
 I am in my mid-20s but want it to be a versatile suit, so nothing either super vintage nor super modern; Regular length and medium-width notched lapels for the jacket and a slim-straight cut for the pants would be ideal. I also would like the suit to have some stretch, as I often get uncomfortable with the restrictive/stiff feel of store-bought suits.
 My budget would ideally be 5million VND, but a lot of talk online about this stuff is from pre-covid times, so I don't know if that is a realistic number. Please correct my expectations if they are unrealistic.
 What tailors would be appropriate for what I am looking for, and what prices can I expect? Also: do I need to buy the fabric separately on my own, or will that be included in the tailor bill? Or would it be cheaper to buy on my own? 
 Any and all advice is much appreciated! Cảm ơn : )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I’m taking a trip to Vietnam soon and trying to workout my itinerary and would love some advice!
 So on the 4th of May, the plan is to take the night train from Dong Hoi up to Tam Coc. I’ve realised maybe 1 day is not enough for Tam Coc. Plus it’s a long journey from Tam Coc up to Ha Giang…
 After Tam Coc, the plan was to do the Ha Giang loop, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, however if we stay the extra day in Tam Coc, plus the long journey, I’m not sure we will have 4 days to do the loop. 
 We have to be in Hai Phong Bay at 11:30am on Monday 10th for a trip to Cat Ba.
 So here is my question:
 Should we skip Tam Coc all together, get up to Ha Giang and just do the loop for as long as we can? Should we do the 2 days in Tam Coc and just do a smaller loop of Ha Giang? Should I stick to 1 day in Tam Coc and the 4 day loop of Ha Giang?
 It looks like if we decide to go to Tam Coc, we will have to get a night bus up to Ha Giang. And of course then another night bus from Ha Giang down to Hanoi. Lot of night travel - is it too much? Should we ease up and save stuff for another visit?
 Thanks for your help!

I'm 21F, Indian, and have a BA degree in History and am currently in my last year of law school. I have been seriously contemplating the idea of enrolling in a CELTA course and English as a foreign language full time, but this particular trip is going to have to be limited to 1 month. 
 I am looking at volunteering to to teach English or working with children in any capacity. I understand that my lack of certification and the duration of the trip is going to be an issue but I would be happy to be involved in any sort of volunteer work. I have previously worked as a college counselor for underprivileged children and been a paid tutor at an IELTS center in my city. 
 I have managed to find a few workaway opportunities that help you assist English language teachers and work on curriculum development but I'm not sure how legit they are. Please help connect me to any volunteer opportunities in the month of June.

Just arrived in Vietnam, rented a scooter in Mui Ne and within the first 15 minuntes I was taken to the police station. Tried to haggle the fine but in the end I left with 500k less in my pocket. 
 Given that I am not going to be able to produce a valid licence since Im already here and my IDP has only a B stamp: Are there any tricks to avoid being stopped or prevent the fine at all? I'm going to be renting bikes in Dalat, Da Nang, Nihn Binh and Ha Giang, so would rather not pay 500k each time.
 If not able to avoid police encounters, what would the minimum reasonable "fine" that I could settle for?

 So I wanted to ask if anyone had alternative motorbiking suggestions in north Vietnam? Theres a 5 day window in our itinerary between stops at Sapa and Ha Long Bay, so any suggestions of beginner friendly routes lasting 2-5 days would be awesome!

 Most of the other discussion I see mention resorts for beaches but are the public beaches here good? My wife suffers a bit from too much sun so we wouldn’t mind having umbrellas and facilities at the beaches! 
 We will also spend a couple of days towards the south west of the island if anyone jas recommendations?
 Thanks a lot in advace!

I loved it and I want to be back for another remote working period, maybe in Da Nang. My only concern is the internet speed, as my job relies heavily on Zoom meetings. Last time the connection was bumpy, I had some serious issues one day and I am concerned. I read the news and know about internet cables, but I prefer first hand information. So here I am, any feedback will be much appreciated. Thanks a lot!

 Is there a way I can rent a motor bike in Hội An or Da Nang and return somewhere in Hue? I won’t have the time to return it back to the original place. 
 Otherwise, would you recommend an alternative mode of transportation (like a bus) where I’d be able to stop and check out the view? 
 For additional context - I’m a budget travel so kinda looking for an affordable way to travel. Also, I’m an exercised driver in Canada but motorbikes are new for me so I’m not sure if this is a beginner friendly route.

 So I'm going to Ha Long Bay with my university and as part of one of the classes were doing a project (mini doc) about community perception of UNESCO world heritage sites and was wondering if anyone knew what the laws around filming in that area are. I wasn't able to find much information other than for large film crews and as this is a school project where I and another classmate would be interviewing 2-3 locals I don't believe we fall into that category. The setup would be minimal with a tripod, camera, mic, and potentially a very small light if needed. Any help or pointers would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào everybody. My friend and I are in Hanoi and after a long trip on the train to get here we’ve been very thirsty. 
 We went to Beer Junction last night thinking we could hydrate with Bia Hoi but no one had heard of it!
 We asked around and looked online but there seems to be no sign of fresh keg beer. Don’t worry, we were able to hydrate with a few tasty green Saigon’s but today our pilgrimage continues. 
 Can anyone help? Does Bia Hoi still exist? 
 Thanks a lot 🍻

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! 
 My girlfriend and I will be setting off on a 7 week trip in 2 weeks to South east Asia, including 3 weeks in Vietnam! Around week 5, we are hoping to take a 5 day trip round the Ha giang loop, and I wanted to discuss the logistics of this here. A few notes:
  
neither of us have ridden a motorcycle/moped before, but are confident car drivers. We have access to a 100cc motorbike for practice
 both of our UK drivers licences cover "AM" vehicles (motorbikes smaller than 50cc) but to ride up to 175cc, we need an A1 licence
 we plan to rent motorbikes in the islands of Thailand earlier in our trip, and gauge whether we think it is feasible to carry out 5 days of driving.
 We will be doing the Ha Giang Loop in early May
  
I guess my biggest question is what are our options?
 Should we try to get an A1 licence before we go? (It only takes a day AFAIK so we should be able to sort it before the trip) if we bother doing this, will we be able to get an IDP that works? I've heard conflicting reports regarding the state of IDPs
 Should we go as we are? In this case we'll need to pay off police I'm sure which isn't a huge deal but I'd be worried about getting our bikes impounded, especially half way through the loop
 Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!

We initially thought we would do the five lakes trail, but since our daughter is only nine and, to be frank, rather short for her age, we don't feel comfortable with the climbing part, as we are not sure she will be able to reach for the ropes. There are, supposedly, two trails to reach five lakes - do you also have to climb when you take the easier one (that is, not the adventure trail)? And has anyone done the peasant trail? I have not been able to find any information on this trail, except that it ends in a water fall and has the best likelyhood to see birds (which would actually be super nice). Does this trail involve any climbing, too?

 Where I grew up very connected to the sea, I grew up on the island life fixing boats, painting them and a lot of community works as apart of the local lifestyle there, as someone who loves nature and sustainability, I'm excited to travel outside of my country for the first time to put my skills to work for a meaningful cause. I'm passionate about balancing sports like slacklining, skateboarding, and surfing. I've spent a good amount of time sharing and teaching these skills. I'm also a documentary filmmaker and love to capture the beauty of nature and the stories of people who live in harmony with the environment.
 Few volunteering opportunities I did : - Helped a farmer for 3 months on his produce somewhere in the lush hills of western ghats in India. - Volunteered for an eco-festival in India to teach skating and help the festival crew. - Volunteered in the himalayas to help build a home-stay with a sustainable lifestyle. - Helped a few homestays and small businesses to provide quality content for their social media.
 Let's work together to make a positive impact while exploring a new culture!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by a comment thread in a recent post, I started to curiously think about the ideological/political alignment of Vietnamese people (or, at least the users of this subreddit): how do you perceive yourself ideologically, disregarding one's support for the government - or lack thereof - as a political position itself?
 Do you appreciate traditional family values, free trade, private property rights, low taxation, strong military, social hierarchies, minimum social spending; are you into trade unions, social egalitarianism, progressive taxation, governmental support programs, free health care and education, gender equality? 
 Do you get thrilled by socializing the means of production, class consciousness, centralized planning, international proletarian revolution and anti-imperialism; or are you proudly "anti-woke", support the interests of Vietnamese people over everything else, think that LGBTQ+ people should just go back to the closet and believe that climate change is a globalist hoax? Answer below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, everyone!
 I am docked at the cargo terminal just outside Ho Chi Minh for the next few days, and I'd like to get to see some of the city, despite my hellish work schedule. For that, I have some questions:
  
Will I be finding much open outside after 11pm?
 Is it realistic to try to use Grab to have someone pick me up? The app as of now gives me an estimate of 19-20min for someone to even show up, and I know the drive to Ho Chi Minh is like 45min-1h.
 Does anyone know a taxi driver who I can contact to perhaps strike a deal to bring crew members in and out for the next couple of days?
  
My company organizes a shuttle bus but it runs only until 8-9pm and I usually leave work at 10pm. I only have USD, and cards. No local currency at the moment. As per Vietnamese authorities, I am also not authorized to wander about anywhere other than Ho Chi Minh, and just a night pass cost me 10 USD, otherwise I'd have 10pm curfew.
 Please help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Vietnamese-American, and I feel as though I haven't developed a really positive relationship with being Viet. But, I would like to relate better to my background.
 For me, I associate the Vietnamese language and Vietnamese life with a lot of negativity. I think of Vietnamese people that are just really focused on money, friends who have issues with their parents, adults that are constantly yelling with each other, and people who just take out their insecurities on others because they want respect or validation,
 I haven't been able to have a lot of positive interactions and associations when it comes to being Viet. Viet life is just viewed as a source of turmoil to me sometimes.
 If you also feel this way about being Viet, please comment your emotions below.
 I know some people who have a good and healthy relationship to being Viet, but I'd consider them to be few. I'd really like to have a better relationship to being Viet, because I feel like a lot of us hate ourselves. Historically, it looks like a lot of us have just wanted to attach ourselves to other larger empires, such as China, France, or America. And, that makes me kinda sad. 
 The few people that I know that have a positive relationship to being Vietnamese come from good, healthy families. But, our community has a lot of trauma, and, to me, that makes those good families become uncommon.

I joined this sub to be able to live vicariously through everyone else traveling while I am not in VN and what I’ve experienced so far is a bunch of nasty people giving travelers shit for not giving every single detail about any given trip or cultural question. If I hadn’t already been to Vietnam and found out that the people there are, by and large, much more friendly and welcoming, this sub would 100% put me off from traveling there.
 (Of course, judging by some of the comments I’ve seen, a lot of you isolationists would be fine with it.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are traveling through Vietnam in April and will be on Phu Quoc for a few days towards the end of our trip. To compensate our daughter a bit for all the walking and looking at things, we had considered visiting the Aquatopia water park. As we know by now, the free shuttle bus has been discontinued, but we found out that the public bus #11 (which also runs from the airport) goes close enough to the cable car station. Only unfortunately it seems that the bus is also no longer running, at least I can't find any information about it on the net (not even on the airport page). Has anyone ridden the bus lately or knows that it no longer exists? If it runs, we would look for a hotel along the bus line, otherwise we go, as actually planned, to Ong Lang and forget the thing with the park simply (I have no desire to pay 60€ for cabs to Cable Station and back, then we rather invest the money in as much ice cream as she can eat...). Or are there any other public busses, preferably from/to the Ong Lang area?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been on a culinary journey lately, exploring the delicious world of Vietnamese breakfasts. We all know and love Pho and Banh Mi, but there's so much more to the Vietnamese breakfast scene that often goes unnoticed. Recently, I've discovered a lesser-known but absolutely mouthwatering dish: Banh Cuon Cao Bang! 😋
 For those who haven't tried it yet, Banh Cuon Cao Bang is a delicate and savory rice noodle roll filled with minced pork, wood ear mushrooms, and shallots. It's usually served with a side of fresh herbs, cucumber, and a tasty dipping sauce. It has quickly become my go-to breakfast choice, and I'm eager to find more dishes like this!
 So, fellow foodies, I'm asking you: What are your favorite Vietnamese breakfasts, particularly the lesser-known ones? Let's uncover some hidden culinary gems together and share our love for Vietnamese cuisine. Please share your favorites and any stories or memories you have associated with them. If you have any secret spots or recipes, feel free to share as well!
 Looking forward to reading your responses and expanding my breakfast horizons! 🍽️
 Cheers and happy eating! 🥢

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/Vietnam!
 I'm currently looking into getting the best out of my Phin filter as I recently got a decent hand grinder. People over at r/coffee tend to be pour-over and aeropress guys so I don't read much about other brewing methods there. That's why I decided to ask here. :)
 Any tips on getting the best brew? I personally haven't tweaked much from what I usually do these past months when I first had a phin: Grind 14g of beans using setting 3 (medium fine) for my 6 click cheapo grinder that I bought over at Shopee, preheat the brewer and the glass, dump the grounds on the brewing chamber and shake to level, drop the press filter and press a bit (this one I'm not sure if necessary), pour hot-off-the-boil water about twice the volume of the coffee into the chamber to bloom the grounds and wait for 30 seconds, pour water to the brim of the chamber, then cover to retain the heat. Drip finishes at around 6 mins.
 I usually make coffee via pour-over and I love the different nuances in the process and how each factor affects the output of the brew, But I love the simplicity of the Phin and how no non-sense it is -it's brute force coffee.
 Also, what should I look for if I want to buy a better Phin filter? And if you are a Timemore C2 user, what is your current grind setting?
 I would love to hear from you guys. :) Thanks!

 We are a group of students conducting a research project on circular economy (in electronics and fashion industry) and we would be grateful if you could take a few minutes to participate in our survey project. The surveys are in Vietnamese so Google Translate could come in handy ;) Thank you so much in advance for your time!
 Chào mọi người, nhóm chúng mình đang làm khảo sát về kinh tế tuần hoàn trong ngành điện tử và thời trang. Mong mọi người có thể giúp mình trả lời các câu hỏi trong phần khảo sát. Mình xin cám ơn rất nhiều!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Southeast Asian nations made March friendlies, even with nations so unstable like Myanmar, not football fanatic like the Philippines or poor like Laos got their friendlies as scheduled.
 Only Cambodia, Vietnam, Brunei and East Timor starved their national teams in March.
 But hey, Cambodia is no superpower. Brunei is ASEAN's minnow. East Timor also a minnow. People will not blame them if they didn't schedule.
 But Vietnam? The nation that reached the final round of FIFA World Cup qualification and yet the national team is left starved with domestic league suspended for a month to serve the U-20 and U-23. For what? Professional countries will not interrupt domestic leagues for youth tournaments, only Vietnam does.
 Who is responsible for this? Who deliberately starved the national team?
 Shameful.

 Let me know what you guys think.

 We fly out of HCMC so we're planning on Da Lat being the last place we visit and then getting bus to HCMC the night before our flight (we've both visited HCMC before so don't feel the need to go again).
 Just trying to figure out how many days to spend in Da Lat, i.e. should we do 2 nights, three days or one night, two days bearing in mind we have a small child with us so will probably be sticking to Da Lat rather than going on any trips in the nearby area. 
 What do people think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I (30F) will be solo travelling through Vietnam in April and I am hoping to do a Ha Giang Loop motorbike tour. I am struggling to find good recommendations. Here are my requirements:
 - Easy rider who drives safe and is friendly
 - Small group tour (max 8 people)
 - Staying in authentic homestays 
 - Off the beaten path/away from other tourists as much as possible (acknowledging that I am a tourist myself)
 - 4 days/3 nights would be ideal but open to slightly longer
 Also, I will be coming from Sa Pa, so any advice about transport between Sa Pa and Ha Giang is welcome. Thanks so much!

It’s limited to just my time in the store throughout the week, but I’ve always loved Vietnamese culture so I’ve gotten to know them and their story better lately. I’ve also recently started learning the most very basics of Vietnamese. Would it be rude to maybe greet them in their native language once I’ve got enough practice?

We are not going thru an agent since i was told they charge exorbitant prices. I was also told not to pay deposit without a deposit paper, renting contract and at least have a look at the apartment.

We wanted to get married next year but we will be 33* (Vietnamese age plus 1 year for Tet) which is a no go according to her mum. I think we then said let’s do it this year but that was also bad and realistically my family couldn’t make it to Vietnam this year. However, we didn’t want to wait until 2025. So after some consultation with a pháp sư her mum said this year was ok and we will have ancestor welcoming (me?) into the family this year on the day of our legal marriage abroad and the wedding ceremony in Vietnam next year, but since it’s unlucky we are just having a “party” not a wedding ceremony. I just found the whole thing kinda confusing. Is this normal across Vietnam?

We’ve only been dating a couple months, but I’ve already met his parents, and while they are very kind to me, I haven’t had a full real conversation with them. It’s always in passing that we exchange words. I’m white and don’t know much about Vietnamese culture or customs, so I’m not sure exactly how to approach them for fear of accidentally coming off as rude or ignorant. I love my boyfriend a lot, and I go to his house and see them pretty often. He doesn’t have a very close relationship with his family, and even they don’t talk much outside of them asking if he’s eaten or where he is, so I’m not sure if he’d be able to help me here. It means a lot to me, having them like me, as I see us having a long future together. Does anyone have any tips or things I should know/necessary knowledge like what is or is not respectful? Or gift ideas to thank them for letting me stay at their house? Anything would be great. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chams, if I remember right, with the fall of Champa, were separated into three groups practising different religions. The Central Chams have largely retained their Hindu belief, although this is practised under a form called "Ba La Mon". The Southern Chams in the Mekong Delta have largely adhered to Sunni Islam and they are the only ethnic group in Vietnam to be Muslims.
 The third Cham group, however, practise a complex religion called "Bani". It was thought to be traced from Persian traders (Persia/Iran was converted to Shia Islam by Shah Ismail I), who spread their Shia Islam to the community during the Vietnamese shogunates (Trinh-Nguyen). However, Bani is unique that it is so synchronised with other religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and even Han and Kinh (Vietnamese) people's folk traditions that it lost most of the original Islamic belief.
 The Bani community is small today but their religious practise has ignited discussions. Some groups believed that they are actually Muslims but with a different characteristic. But some other (including many Banis) disagree with the classification of Bani as a separate Shia Islam sect and instead insist that they are Banis and not Muslims. There is a 2006 documentary called "A Strange Islam" by Agnes De Feo about this community, which put their existence to spotlight.
 Question here is, are Bani people Shia Muslims or just Banis? And what kind of religion Bani is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: My experience in Vietnam is a treasure on my heart. 
 (Rant)I spent time there a few years back. An American in your beautiful country. I think of the smells, the people, the beauty, and the food. Your kindness to me and my travel mate was second to none, from the south to the north. I know it may be required of your culture to be "nice" when you really want to say what needs to be said, but I saw a humble care of the world in which the Vietnamese live, which includes naive tourists. Always kind to me, which I am not used to.
 As an American, I am so thankful for your hospitality. From my perspective, I would have so much animosity towards people like me. Maybe you keep it to yourselves. Or maybe, you just want to move on. A humble strength in family and kindess. 
 Vietnam is one of my fondest memories. I treasure it. I spent a night on a boat in Ha Long Bay. Although I was drunk and silly, the crew invited me and my girlfriend to the kitchen. Vietnamese food and a strange, ridiculously strong sangria. One of the greatest experiences in my life. It was like 345 in the morning!
 I got to sleep in. And the crew, who I think several were celebrating birthdays, were up at like 5! Being hungover on a boat while working sounds impossible. They did it, cause they had to. Tourism is likely the (I don't know) biggest money makers for Vietnam these days I imagine.
 My last night, I got a tattoo on my inner left forearm in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh). I hear that many people tired of their tattoos when they see them everyday. For me? I wax nostalgic and think of how amazing Vietnam was. How it is. And how it treated me and my friend. 
 Not only do I have a great experience. But the people of Vietnam make me want to be a better person. I try everyday. Be humble. Be kind. Make good pho. Regrettably, the latter tastes like salty water. I'll keep trying.
 I miss Vietnam. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a Viet-Kieu who happened to grow up with a very strict Asian mom. I know my mom uses tough love on us but I’m not sure if my mom went out of line disciplining my sister and me.
 These are some of the things she did:
  
She spat and bit me after I didn’t want to wear formal clothes to my friend’s birthday party at age 8. She then clapped and laughed at me after poking holes on my pants with scissors. I cried so hard that day.
 
She cut my pajama pants for refusing to wear anything above the knees.
 
Told me “it was such a huge mistake giving birth to you”.
 
Pour food on head after refusing to eat( I was three at that time).
 
Beat my sister so hard she bled from her mouth when she was 4-5 y.o.
 
Kicked me in the back.
 
Called me “thang dong tinh”( similar to the f-slur) and splashed tea at me for reason number 2 (luckily the tea was cold at that time).
 
Screamed and calling me “thang cho”( a dog) for not bringing a ruler to school.
 
 This happened to me when I was 6-12 y.o. My sister told me my mother was abusive but I don’t think she was since I’ve seen some of my Vietnamese relatives’ parents who did stuffs way worse than my mom did.

My parents are from mixed backgrounds, dad a boat refugee from a military family and mom a very upperclass business family in real estate. I've considered moving back after getting a job offer but ultimately decided not to purely because it wouldn't further my career, at least not in the industry I'm in. Really did consider it though since I got lots of family there too
 That being said, I do have very mixed feelings of the current government. On one hand, they freed us from all our colonizers which is something I think all of us feel very proud of and it just feels liberating, you know, knowing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It probably hasnt been discussed on here much, but curious to see thoughts on the gender disparity.
 Vietnam has the 5th highest in the world , with 111.4 male births (currently) to every 100 females: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sex-ratio-at-birth?tab=table
 This has been a social trend in the country for 30-35 years, but it has accelerated dramatically over the past 10-20 years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Vietnam#/media/File%3AVietnam_population_pyramid_01.04.2019.png
 Any thoughts on this? I can imagine some pretty concerning social issues arising from this in future (if not already)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is not an appropriate place to post this, but I wasn’t sure what other subreddit to post this to.
 I met a Vietnamese guy on a tour last year in South America. We stayed in touch and when I went over to Thailand, we decided to meet up there. I’ve noticed that he is not that polite to hotel and restaurant staff as well as drivers. For example, he doesn’t say thank you when staff brings his drink or food to the table ever. He doesn’t say thank you when we are leaving the restaurant and they are saying thank you and goodbye. He’s not mean to them or anything, he simply ignores them. We hired a driver and instead of walking a few meters to meet the driver, he insisted the driver come into a very tight spot even though it was super inconvenient for the driver to have to back out. I tried to tell him we can just walk up to a more convenient spot and he said no, that we are paying the guy so we will wait for him to come to us.
 I’m wondering if this is just a cultural thing? I am ethnically Vietnamese, however I grew up in the US and my attitude is completely different (I’ve also worked in the hospitality industry so maybe I’m hypersensitive to this). I grew up being taught to be extra nice to hospitality workers because they work very hard but make very little. I get a sense from him that he sees them as beneath them. Is this a common attitude towards staff in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although there is some similarity to other neighboring countries, our culture as well as clothing still have clear differences. For example, Vietnamese smoke Thuốc Lào, eat Trầu, dye their teeth black, wear darker color outside and colorful inner Áo Mớ Ba Mớ Bảy, and hair keep hair loose. In clothing, we have many hats like Nón Quai Thao, Nón Đinh Tự, Toàn Hoa etc. Just like the chest wrap skirt in the video, we Vietnamese use it with a Round collar robe - Áo Viên Lĩnh inside with hair covering fabric; while others don't.

 I don't want to be disrespectful, but I have a sincere question. 
 I spent a night in a sleeping bus in a lower cabin and the guys from the company had no choice but to sleep on the ground between cabins. One guy spent the entire night spreading his legs right and left, and doing so, he was touching my bottom all night long. I could not sleep because it made me feel really inconfortable. I tried many times to push his legs, but he would do it again, and again and again. 
 I don't understand, because I thought it was very disrespectful to touch people of the opposite sex?
 Is it normal? How should I react if it happens again? Can I ask him to stop doing it or would he be angry? 
 Thank you for your answers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serious question here. Why do so many Vietnamese burn garbage? Outside of the traffic situation, burning of things and the resulting air pollution it causes is without a doubt the most negative aspect of this amazing country. I don’t get it as everything I have seen on fire could have easily been put on virtually any curb for pickup by the garbage crews at least in the cities where smoke impacts a lot of people. 
 It makes me so mad as it not only affects my health, but more so, that of babies and children who are more vulnerable plus ALL of you who live here. Why is this not something the government is cracking down on as the trickle down health effects surely are taking a toll on the nation...even just cognatively as it effects your brain too. Plus, who wants to constantly be getting whiffs of burning plastics and whatnot on the daily? It is 2023 and we KNOW better, so why the ignorance in this particular area here? 
 If you burn things on the regular basis…why? Can you please shed some light as to your motivations? 
 From Wikipedia:
 “The World Health Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.[6] Studies published in March 2019 indicated that the number may be around 8.8 million.[127] A 2022 review concluded that air pollution was responsible for 6.67 (5.90–7.49) million premature deaths in 2019. It concluded that since 2015 little real progress against (superordinate) pollution, which remained at ~9 million earlier deaths, can be identified.[128][19]00090-0-19) Causes of deaths include strokes, heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections.[6]"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title suggests. I’ll be arriving in Hanoi on an afternoon and would be looking to navigate to Ha long bay that very moment.
 Planning on spending an evening + next day there. Recommendations for a day cruise or a cruise which maybe starts in the evening and goes up until the next day in the evening?
 Looking to do activites such as Kayaking and swimming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone has some experience on what may be the best approach. For my last two days in Vietnam, I'm struggling to decide on two different scenarios. I'm not deterred by long days and aim to do as much as I can. I've heard Ha Long Bay is more touristy, so I'd like to avoid that if possible. But here are what I've found to be the best scenarios - so if there are other options that I am not thinking of, please share!
 Option One: Day trip excursion from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay. Lasts ~12 hours and allows me to book another one day excursion from Hanoi for the second day. I feel like this will result in roughly 6 hours total of travel back and forth for each day, so seems like I am not getting the most out of my days. But, may allow me to see something else I haven't considered for a day trip.
 Option Two: Depart early AM via train or bus to Cat Ba Island, arriving midday. This allows some brief exploration of Cat Ba National Park. However, the following day it is unclear to be me if I can actually see Lan Hay Bay. I will be leaving out of Hanoi at 2300hrs that night, so need to be back to the airport around 2000hrs. It looks like my options to get back to mainland are to ferry at 1530hrs (ending my day prematurely) or at 1730hrs (getting back too late). Would it even be possible for me to see Lan Ha Bay in this time? The only thing I've found only is departing from 0800 and not arriving back to the island until 1500, which means my only option would be to take the ferry back at 1730. I'd like to make this option work, if I can, to see the mostt of the island but looks like the timing doesn't quite work :(
 ​
 Thanks!

I’m looking for long walks and beautiful scenery, good food, great cafes I can read in for hours and people watch. No budget. As an aside, watched The Scent of Green Papaya years ago and thought the scenery was gorgeous, looking for that kind of ambience. Thoughts? Recommendations? Naysayers? All appreciated, thanks!
 Edit: no, not switching my trip to Boulogne. Ignore the movie set dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow travelers! I recently arrived in North Vietnam and I've been on the hunt for off-beat places to explore. While Hanoi was amazing, I couldn't wait to get out of the city and immerse myself in the beautiful nature of this country.
 But my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I arrived at Ha Long Bay. The pictures I saw online were nothing like the reality I experienced. It was crowded with tourists and heavily commercialized. I needed to find a hidden gem!
 That's why I'm turning to you, fellow travelers, for help. Do you know of any hidden spots in North Vietnam that are off the beaten path? Maybe a secret waterfall, a secluded beach, or a quaint village with friendly locals?
 I'm on the hunt for something unique and authentic. Something that's not overrun with tourists and where I can truly experience the beauty of Vietnam. So, if you have any recommendations, please share them in the comments below!
 Let's help each other escape the tourist trap and discover the hidden treasures of North Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I wanted to kindly ask for any advice and recommendations regarding possible job opportunities in the tourism/hotel sector of Da Nang/Hoi An. I am 32 years old, originally from Germany. I have BA degree in Southeast Asian and American Studies. I am considering to do a second degree in Tourism/Hotel-Management at an online university in order to be able to work while studying. 
 My overall CV has a lot of "holes" in it, because in my 20s I spent quit a fair amount of time traveling around the globe. I worked seven years as a freelance journalists with a main emphasis on tourism; had countless jobs in restaurants; worked for a company specialized in book trade; and, more recently, been employed as a social worker at a school in Germany. I also have my own little side hustle going on, selling records/cds/cassettes. In addition, I speak Indonesian and Malay, and I am currently trying to advance my Vietnamese language skills. 
 In the near and distant future, I'd like to live and work in Da Nang. I spent a fair amount of time in the city in the recent decade, and I feel very much at home there. My girlfriend lives in Da Nang, too, and we are in committed long term relationship. Therefore, I am considering to find a suitable occupation for myself in the city, and I can picture myself doing a good job in the tourism sector. Online, though, I can barely find any job ads. 
 I'd be very grateful if anyone could give me some honest feedback if I'd be able to get a work permit in the tourism sector in Da Nang with my background; and if so, I'd appreciate any tips on what to keep in mind, what to be careful about, and so forth. 
 Thank you so much in advance! =)

 My question is if I use a popular song in the ceremony, will there be accusations of copyright infringement? I'd like apologize if I asked something dumb, but I'm a 2nd year student, still got a lot to learn, and this is my first time doing such important thing.

I'm so rubbish at cooking but trying to learn and I'm not doing to bad. I just need a simple recipe for the pancakes. I have bacon and shrimp and spring onions for the pancakes.
 The fish sauce dip I have nooooo clue what it's supposed to taste like. I've never tasted fish sauce before. I have lemon 🍋 sugar and the fish sauce. I don't have any chili flakes as I'm making it for my 8 year old daughter too (also I'm a stereotypical English WF who can't handle too much heat! Wahhh ) So any simple step by step for the dip please 🙏 My partner is coming over to visit and I want to impress him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be visiting VietNam very soon on vacation. My husband and I have a few tour guides and drivers that are helping us on our tour of the country. We are obviously planning to tip generously for their service but we thought an additional small gift from the US might be a nice touch. Obviously nothing too elaborate but a nice token as a friendly cultural exchange. I'm looking for ideas of something easy to pack. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just wanted to share an interesting story of what happened to us at Gibbon trek. We have tracked down family of four female, male and two babies all foraging and playing. They seem to have a lot of fun amongst each other, especially the babies. About 30 minutes of watching them they have decided to leave the tree and go further. Male Gibbon went directly above us and let it rip, the poop showered us, my camera, clothes, and my girlfriends clothes. Anyone got similar experience with Gibbons? Our guide told us this never happened on his treks, so I'm just wondering. Amazing experience anyway, would get pooped on by a wild Gibbon any day. 10/10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just looking at something like a passport power index doesn’t answer this question because almost every European country requires a visa for Vietnamese tourists. 
 But there is a big difference in how hard it is to get a Schengen visa vs. say a Moldovan visa.
 What are some of the easiest European visas for Vietnamese to get?
