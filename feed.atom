        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Viet Kieu living in Vietnam at the moment, and part of several Facebook groups of women, including single women. I'm seeing more and more women decided to skip matching with white foreigners on dating apps like Bumble. Members in the group share "sexual escapades" by white foreigners in Thailand, which recently tighten their immigration policies, and cause a lot of them to "flee" to other SEA countries like Vietnam. Bald white guys in their 30s are the most obvious skip for these girls, and they are well informed of the LBH that are here on working visas. The language barrier is also another issue they mention, where it's exhausting to use Google translate for every little thing. Many of them share stories of them being coerced into sex by these men, even on first date.
 I'm not really surprised to hear all these stories from Viet girls in both Saigon and Hanoi, and I also translate and share a few of these creeps' posts from reddit on Facebook. Ever since the pandemic Viet people seem to be more wary of white foreigners (they seem more receptive to Koreans and other Asians)
 Of course, some of the more malicious girls like to take these naive foreigners on a wild ride with expensive dates then ditch them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnamese American here, I'm doing research on all the different fox spirits across asia and while China, Japan, and Korea's nine tailed foxes seem to have plenty of sources online that I can look at, there's barely any for vietnam's, and my best source thus far for the ho ly tinh has been wikipedia but even its wikipedia page says that it needs more citations and more reliable resources. So I wanted to ask here to see what y'all know about it and preferably if you could also point me in the direction of any sources(preferred is english because I don't know how to read or type vietnamese but I can make do with google translate.) 
 I also wanted to ask how people in vietnam generally view the creature.
 In China and Japan they range from pure evil, to harmless pranksters, to very kind and benevolent beings.
 In Korea, they are seen as purely malevolent creatures
 So I wanted to know how Vietnam generally views them. Do they range from being good to evil? Or are they just evil?
 What powers do they have, generally speaking?
 And the most important one is, how do they get their many tails? Is it just through age? Or do they do something special to get their tails? 
 I've wanted to reconnect with my culture now and I want to do it with my life long passion for mythology. Thank you in advance for any help!

They are manual bidets - basically a garden hose to spray up ones rectum. However, this can't remove everything cleanly. I've gotten around this by carrying tissues with me and doing a combination of the bidet and paper wipes. Are people just sitting on the toilet and spraying nonstop until everything is cleaned? Are people just walking around with chocolate fudge in their rectums all day? I need to know!

 He escaped after the fall of South Vietnam and is thinking of returning but is afraid of the government sending him to jail or give him a hard time.
 Any advice from all people would be great, thanks.
 Also happy tet!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved to Hanoi last summer and honestly I’ve had a terrible experience, I was sexually assaulted in the first week of arriving and I’m still dealing with the police beaurocracy regarding that. Had a breakup of my 2 year relationship, with the person I moved over to Vietnam with and subsequently lost my job due to needing time off to process that. In addition to these personal things, the pollution bothers me and I still haven’t yet mastered driving a motorbike because I had a pretty nasty crash which has put me off for the time being. 
 In my head I’m imagining a move to HCM to be much better, I previously lived in Shanghai and I do prefer the feeling of a big metropolis - but I guess the problems with traffic are even worse there? I’ve struggled to find contemporary art and music events, and it seems like there is more of that type of thing in HCM. 
 Or do I have completely the wrong idea? Should I move somewhere else entirely? I can’t feasibly leave Vietnam for another year because I really need to make back the money I spent on document legalisation etc to get here 
 Thanks for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foreigner here. I go to my wife's hometown pretty often, so for the last four years, I've joined in a lot of celebrations and ran into a lot of the same faces. The "anh"s and "chú"s still really like to drink with me and I'm always sort of a VIP at gatherings despite being more of an introvert and not good in large gatherings.
 My problem: a lot of these guys think it's so fun to ask me what their names are in front of everyone, and more often than not, I don't remember. It's always the same super embarrassing moment when I'm racking my brain to think of this guy's name while everyone is either cringing or laughing at me. And then they tell me their name but because I'm so mortified, I just can't even remember it later even if I make a mental note. My Vietnamese is intermediate, but a lot of these guys in the village have names that I don't know the meanings of, so hard to draw connections...
 This is why gatherings in my wife's hometown are not fun for me. I'm always on edge, and when I sit down around a "mâm", I need to look around and see if there's anyone I don't know or remember and try to listen for their name in conversation. 
 So what should I do to stop looking like such an asshole who can't be bothered to learn people's name and how to better diffuse the situation when it inevitably happens that I don't know a name?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow... this is probably an impossible question to answer, but we're planning our 2 week trip to Vietnam March 7-21 and after accounting for Hanoi (3ish days), Hoi An (3ish days), Ninh Binh (2ish days), I feel like we can only include 1 of these 'adventure' places to not feel rushed. If you HAD to pick 1 (maaaybe 2) of these experiences, what's your pick?
 3ish days to trek in Sapa
 4 days motorbiking the Ha Giang Loop
 3 days with a guided cave expedition in Phong Nha
 3 days motorbiking/trekking in Dalat
 Some background info: my wife and I are in our late 20's and love combining city life, food, culture, and nature/adventure on our trips. If anything, it's hard for us to 'chill' and slow down while traveling, but we're certainly trying to embody that on this trip more than others :)

With a brief google search I've found that as long as my cat fits in a carry on bag under my seat, has her rabies shot, documents with her history of vaccines, and a vet approved letter she should be able to fly and enter the country with me. 
 I'd love to know if anyone can share their experience travelling with a pet to Vietnam and if I am missing any information. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Please help me (39F and Canadian) do something kind for my Vietnamese immigrant neighbours (late 20s M/F and 3F) for Lunar New Year tomorrow.
 They are such good neighbours! They made me pho when I had surgery and they feed my children homemade spring rolls. One time the Ba Noi was visiting from Vietnam and she made me shrimp in banana leaves but I didn’t know how to eat it. I tried to ask the Ba Noi but she doesn’t speak English so I just tried to take a bite out of the banana leaf. The Ba Noi laughed and laughed and showed me how to unwrap them and eat the shrimp.
 Their little 3F comes over to play with my kids almost every day and we just love her so much. Her parents work so hard — six days a week and long hours. They are such good people and I’m so happy to know them. 
 Anyhow, tomorrow is Lunar New Year and I know they usually have a big party with their Vietnamese friends and set off fireworks. 
 I read that usually you give gifts of money in red envelopes for Lunar New Year. Would that be appropriate for me, their white Canadian neighbour, to bring over tomorrow?
 My two concerns are that I don’t want them to feel that they have to invite me to their party, reciprocate the gift or make them uncomfortable. Also I don’t want to accidentally do something unlucky.
 Thank you Reddit for any advice you can give me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are considering a month summer trip on the Vietnam SE coast. Potentially flying into Denang and spending a week in Hoi An and then maybe flying or night bus/train to Nha Trang and staying there for 3 weeks for relaxing beach time. 
 I’ve read you can’t rent a car in Vietnam and we would not feel comfortable riding scooters with our kid (or even probably just an adult 🤣). 
 The places I’m looking at to stay are not in the city center so we can have more space and a pool. We already live in a high rise in a big SE Asian city, so I’d prefer a villa experience while on vacation. 
 My husband thinks having to use Grab multiple time a day if you want to grocery shop, eat out, visit a different beach will be a huge hassle and the cost will add up. This feels like a dealbreaker to him and he thinks we should scrap the Vietnam idea and go to a different country. :(. I read about hiring a car with driver for a few weeks. This sounds pretty weird to me and maybe awkward, but I figured I need to explore this option.
 How do you find a trusted driver like that? Through your villa rental management staff or is their a reputable company people use? I’ve read about scams where drivers will try to take you to restaurants or tours that give them a commission, which I want to avoid. 
 TIA!

My university has a study abroad program with RMIT Vietnam that I’m interested in and was wondering how good the university is regarding their curriculum and class settings. I’m set to graduate a year early within my degree plan as I’ve earned many college credits during high school and I want to have an opportunity to go out of the States to study abroad during my 3 years in college.
 How are the programs or courses in information technology and computer science there? Most importantly, what’s the outlook like with the tech or CS industry in Vietnam as I’m interested in networking around as well. I’m looking at doing a semester worth of courses, so any insights about university life and studies revolving around the RMIT campus or Vietnam in general are highly appreciated.

 Vegetable Spring rolls look tiny, but somehow I already feel full after eating just a couple. Bánh mì is another one - just half a sandwich and I’m already satisfied. And don’t get me started on the pho or bun bo hue - I think it would take me two full days to finish one bowl
 Back home I could easily devour several slices of pizza and still be hungry, so not sure why Vietnamese food is filling me up so quickly lol

 I applied for visa through them thinking they were government official site (gov.vn) and received the e-visa about a week later. I then asked a question about how my name appears on the e-visa (last,first, middle vs. last, middle,first) and got no response. It’s been a week since. I read the on the embassy website that visas done by third party may not be legit and can result in entrance refusal. Anyone has experience with this site or this kind of service? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am planning a trip of about 3/4 weeks in Vietnam and I would like to travel the whole country from north to south (or maybe the other way around).
 Because of work, the only times I can take a full 3 to 4 weeks is either August or end of December/beginning of January around the Christmas holidays. I seem to understand that both these times are not ideal from a weather point of view.
 I have been researching quite a bit and if I got it right it looks like I am going to risk typhoons in the north in August; while December is quite cold in the north and very rainy in the central area of Hue and Hoi An.
 Unfortunately I cannot get around these two times of the year, so I was wondering if you have any suggestions. Maybe some of you have been in August or December and can let me know if it's really risky to the point of having the whole trip ruined by weather?
 I am somewhat tending towards December. Can you enjoy the cruise in Halong Bay at this time or is it too cold and foggy?
 Thanks so much for any tip you may want to give me! :)

 My honest question is though ... Why do so many Vietnamese people make it so hard to learn the language? By this i mean, if I say something wrong in Thai or Khmer, or Italian, I am corrected and helped. In Vietnam, they just give you the "wavy hands" or worse still laugh!
 When Vietnamese speak English to me, much of it is wrong, but I appreciate that they are trying and I "autocorrect" what they said in my head, so as to not embarrass them and then I answer them. The same cannot be said the other way. 
 I really am not meaning to be rude, but why do many Vietnamese (I appreciate it not all) simply try to help me, by autocorrecting and helping me to speak better? 
 Many thanks for all your help!

 Like most leagues and countries there are issues with corruption, greed and self interest. But what really gets me with Vietnam is the MASSIVE potential for the sport, the huge love for the support... but the terrible attendances to league games.
 Sure there are issues with marketing, match fixing, poor kick off times, poor product and more... but I would like to ask the Vietnamese in this group, and those that live here... What are the issues YOU see in Vietnamese football and how would you change them to make things better? Thanks!

 I understand the Catholics, land owners, and capitalists. They would obviously side with Western ideals.
 But it doesn't explain the Buddhist majority, or the majority of people who were not that wealthy. Why did they fight with the U.S. against Ho Chi Minh? Can anyone shed some light on this issue? What were their motivations and beliefs?
 Every time I try to read about this I get the U.S. and International perspective. But I never understand what was happening with the actual Vietnamese people there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Redditors,
 I am a 47-year-old Belgian man who has had the pleasure of visiting Vietnam 12 times, spending a total of 16 months there. Through my interactions with the South Vietnamese community where I live, as well as my multiple visits and online relationships, I have become fluent in speaking and writing in Vietnamese. In fact, when a native Vietnamese speaker hears me on the phone, they often mistake me for a Vietnamese person. In addition to my fluency in Vietnamese, I also speak French, Dutch and English, and have a basic understanding of German.
 My dream is to find a job in South Vietnam, but I am facing a bit of a hurdle. I have been working for the government since 1996 and therefore do not have any other qualifications beyond my high school diploma. Additionally, I have no concrete proof of the skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout my career. However, I am skilled in working with computers and have strong communication abilities. My current job involves designing templates that are sent to millions of citizens, but the software I use is not utilized by any companies in Vietnam.
 I am willing to accept a salary that is typical for Vietnam, as money is not a concern for me. My only qualifications are my high school diploma and my work experience, so my CV is essentially my career. I am open to any job, but I am unsure of the best course of action. Should I try to find a job while on a tourist visa and do visa runs until I secure employment? Or, should I enroll in a school in Ho Chi Minh City in order to obtain a student visa? I believe my English and Vietnamese language abilities are sufficient to pass any necessary tests, and I am eager to immerse myself in the educational experience.
 All I know is that I am happiest when I am in Vietnam, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to make my dream a reality. Thank you for reading and for your responses.

 Growing up in Canada I've never really had the need to say new year wishes in Vietnamese to my other friends here but rather just my grandparents and parents. So I'm used to saying things like chúc mừng năm mới.. or con chúc ông bà nhiều xúc khỏe song lâu tram tuoi etc. 
 So my question is are there any ideas on how I can send her new year wishes without just the plain chúc mừng năm mới? In other words what are some ways to send wishes from friend to friend. 
 From the top of my head in the context of friend to friend, I can only think of wishing for good health, happiness and lots of money. 
 Apologies if this question came out kind of odd or if i'm overthinking it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are visiting VN from March 8-26th. Where we are flying into and out is still in the air depending on the itinerary. I'm a 41 Hue refugee that at 2 months old we escaped from VN to Hong Kong then Philippines then CA, US. I have never been back, and the plan was to visit in 2020 but covid hit. Now is the time. Super excited. Minus traveling days we should have 16 full days.
 Here are the places I wanted to visit: Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Long bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An.
 Originally we wanted to fly into Saigon then fly into Da Nang and make our way up north and fly home from Hanoi. However after watching vids on youtube and reading, wondering if we should just skip Saigon and spread say 2 days to the cities mentioned above. Is it worth visiting giving our amount of days in VN? I've heard people say they wouldn't have been sad if they skip it while others say it's a must visit. Also how many days of each cities is sufficient.
 Any suggestions would be helpful. thank you.

 They are in their early 70s and I know he was a soldier in the NVA. Would it be acceptable to bring this topic up in a respectful way and in an appropriate setting (e.g. during a one-on-one conversation while going for a walk, not at the family dinner table)?
 I'm asking because - unsurprisingly - WWII is still a touchy topic in Germany. But these two wars are obviously very different, with Germany being the aggressor and committing genocide. My own grandparents never talkes about WWII, although the topic was still always weirdly present in the background.
 I've done a bit of reading beforehand (Last Night I Dreamed of Peace by Đặng Thùy Trâm, The Sorrow of War by Bảo Ninh, The Peguin History of Modern Vietnam by Christopher Goscha) and watched the Ken Burns documentary about the War, so I wouldn't be totally ignorant and ask dumb/insensitive questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grandfather is name Tuat Van Nguyen born in Hanoi, Vietnam and I believe he grew up in Hanoi, where he was kidnapped on his way to Catholic school. His father was a locksmith. This is all I can gather from him as it is it is a very sensitive topic. We are heading back to Vietnam to search for his parents, or any members of his family, in Saigon and then making our way to Hanoi. I am hoping I can get a head start with some search tips online. It seems the best way to go searching for this would be to look at church records but unfortunately, I need help on the ground. Or any sort of obituary. He seemed to recall one sister. Would it be worth hiring a private investigator? This time we're going back in April. I am his first granddaughter 33 years old and will accompany him.
 Both his grandparents lived in Thai Binh, and he lived there with them before he went to school in Hanoi with his parents.
 His father, Yet Van Nguyen
 Mother, Do Thi Nguyen
 Grandfather, Tuat Van Nguyen born 07/15/1935. He did spend some time in Paris, I think when he was about in his 20s. Someone took him under his wing but he left back to Vietnam to search again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone - I've spent the last few days combing through all your posts on traveling Vietnam, lots of helpful stuff so thanks to everyone. Currently planning on flying to Hanoi mid Sept, spending a couple days there and bussing to Ha Giang, doing the loop on motorbike then coming back. 
 My bday is at the end of the trip and I'd like to splurge a little at a luxury-ish resort or something where I can really chill out and be taken care of. From what I've read so far, current top of the list is Da Nang, but just wanted to see if anyone has any other good recs. 
 Wants
 -Remote-ish, not overly touristy but still some kind of town action we can walk to for food, beers, etc.
 -Resort with a pool, preferably overlooking the beach
 -Proximity to other towns/beaches so we can rent scooters and go on little day trips
 Recommendations on Towns or actual resorts would be amazing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When compared to other Sinosphere nations like China, South Korea, and Japan, Vietnamese culture seems more chill. Education is efficient and not stressful while work culture isn't as intense. Vietnamese students have more extracurricular activities to do such as football compared to Chinese students who study day and night from the start of life to prepare for the gaokao. Vietnamese suicide rates are much lower than Japan's or South Korea's.
 What cultural/social/political developments led to Vietnamese culture being more chill?

 I’m a 25 year old guy, coming from Canada. Will be in Saigon from Feb 13-23, then over to Hanoi.
 I’ll be around the District 1 area (in general, still confirming Airbnb) and I’d like to see if anyone wants to be friends? Or do some tourist things together?
 I love food and would like to try as much as I can around the area! I love experiencing new things, and getting tattoos. 
 I’m also open to any local ideas of things to do around the area, or day trips for motorcycle?
 Send me a DM, or comment!

I have not fully decided, but I'm leaning heavily on the smaller 150cc for less weight and fuel economy. I have past experience with 300cc-600cc motorbikes but it doesn't make sense to ride the bigger bikes in Vietnam. I'm looking to ride around town and occasional long rides.
 I'm open to getting the R3 or Ninja 400 as well.
 Please let me know what your best experiences are and what makes good sense. (Note: I will have an Airblade in case I'm lazy.)
 Thanks in advance!

 I wasn't raised In n Asian household so I was slowly learning about my Viet culture 
 I went to a Vietnamese restaurant, and I couldn't finish all my food, and I felt really bad about it.... because I didn't want to leave a bad impression. I heard that it's seen as wasting food, and is also disrespectful to the chef in other east Asian cultures just didn't know if it was the same for Viet. I feel really bad about it.

My dad got an MBA during the 1990s, and he went back home to work for an insurance company. My mom obtained a law degree in Vietnam and worked in a different field. My question is: what kind of jobs can my parents do? Obviously, I will be the person who helps them start over and climb the social ladder, but at the same time, I don't want them to struggle in old age. Can my dad start over and work at a company with his US degree, even though it will take several years to adjust and improve his English? What kind of jobs can my mom do? I have heard a lotta became nail techs, but I'm unsure if she could handle all the drama and long working hours. I honestly love them so much for all the work they put in to send me here, so at least I want to help them with a new life :( If any of yall in similar boats, I would love to hear yall your experiences!!

If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it. I have most of the journey mapped out but there's not much english language travel out there for Thanh Hoa so it's hard to find exactly where they are. 
 I remember going to 1) a tourist destination of a river with a lot of fish, and 2) a medium/large busy indoor/outdoor market on the way to Sam Son which had amazing pho and lots of street food. I don't remember and apparently didn't write down anywhere the names or specific locations of either of these places and google isn't helping me. I would love to know if these places still exist and if so exactly where they are :D Any help would be very appreciated, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently in HCMC and am flying home on Thursday from Hà Nội. I’m assuming that due to new year, the flights direct are both expensive and almost non existent.
 Flight searching tools show most routes stop off at Phu Quoc. On my final day before going to Hà Nội, should I get an early flight to Phu Quoc, spend the day there (with my luggage which could be a pain) and then fly later into Hà Nội. Or am I better off getting flights closer together and spending less time on the island? 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated

I'd kind of rather play things by ear when we get there, book our flights and hotels now and then when we get there do some things like river tour or an overnight cruise. But I'm not sure how crucial it is to book those things in advance. When we get there, can we talk to the hotel about booking a cruise or a guided tour or will it be difficult to locate those with short notice?

If so, do you pay customs and duties when you receive it back home? I’m wondering if I just deal with it and carry a few suits for the next 3.5 months, or if it makes sense to pay the shipping to Canada and then potentially pay the customs and duties on it. 
 I’m not sure how the process works, but it seems like this can be quite an expensive endeavour. Any advice would be appreciated!

 Just wanted to hear people's story so I can share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm currently planning on a trip to Vietnam and thinking through transportation around the city- specifically grab availability to and from my hotels to the airport. Some of my hotels do offer airport transportation, but I can't figure out if their quoted prices are a serious upcharge compared to Grab.
 I've been to other countries before where ride share apps are available, but cars are limited (eg, it takes 30-40 minutes to get a car and the car cancels multiple times.) Is this a cause for concern with Grab in Vietnam?
 Hoping to ask for your insight about transportation and the reliability, availability, and pricing of Grab in:
  
Saigon Airport to District 3 around 11pm: Are cars available at this time? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
 Hanoi airport to old town: I believe I've read on a Reddit thread that the car picking you up is not the one the app promised. Is this still the case? What would the pricing be?
 Halong Bay port to Van Don Airport: This is the one I'm worried about the most. Is Grab availability quick here? If not, does anyone have recommendations on how to get to the airport? Any companies you use that you recommend?
 Da Nang Airport to Hoi An: Are grabs available and reliable here? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
  
As a female, my primary concern is safety, reliability, and flexibility. Our group is 3 people: will this change the type of car we need for Grab?
 Thank you so much for any insight you can give on any of these cities and your experiences in transportation here! I really really appreciate it.

 Does anyone have thoughts on what can I do to help and raise awareness? There's a stigma going on to not help them for fear of scams or something but wth... they are doing what they are doing because they need the money or it's their livelihood. 
 What's especially bothering me are the tourists! Like what are you doing bargaining with the locals? You have the privilege and luxury of travelling well and stuff, paying a little extra and giving them a better life. 
 Sorry, I was venting a little bit back to the topic, what can I do to help? I've been giving money here and there and it's endless. I'm buying stuff I don't need and I don't know what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 So, I'm suffering from misophonia. Misophonia basically means you react extremely sensitive to some sounds. Not just - I don't like that sound - but full on rage / anxiety / panic / fear / aggression triggered immediately upon being subjected to it. It can be conditional though - meaning a sound only triggers that reaction in some context but not in others.
 Sounds like that for me are bass from music (no problem with bass from music I hear myself or when going to a night club but when trying to sleep f.x.). People smacking while eating. 
 Now - why do I direct this question specifically at Vietnamese people and not expats or tourists reading this? Well, Vietnam is a very loud culture and to make things worse sound proofing of buildings here doesn't seem to exist. At least I have never "seen" any. Windows especially are always leaking air and because of that sound from outside.
 So, I'd assume that a misophonically challenged person would be suffering a lot. But, is misophonia even a problem here? Maybe being subjected to very loud sounds all the time since birth provides immunity to it? Do you know of Vietnamese misophonics - are you one yourself? What are your triggers? How do you cope? How do you arrange yourself with it?
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody, my wife and I booked a flight from Vientiane to Hanoi for January 15th through 12go.asia. I made a dumb mistake and put in the wrong last name, her birth name instead of the name she has now after the marriage. After being in contact with support from 12go.asia, they informed me that you have to request the change at least 3 days before departure date. I know it was my mistake but I just can't believe that you can't change something like this before the flight. Does anybody have experience with this? Could we just show up at the airport and try to change it there? Would we have to cancel the whole booking or could we just buy a new ticket for her and I could keep my booking, even though I made a booking for 2 people? Thanks in advance in case anybody could give me information on this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla has recently decreased its Model Y prices from $66,000 to only $53,000 and the Model Y Performance now starts at only $57,000 with a 0-60 time of 3.5 seconds and 303 miles of range as well (down from 330 miles on the Base Model Y). With the Vinfast VF 8 still starting at $59,000 despite having less track record than Tesla, what do you now think of the Vinfast VF 8 and what are your opinions of Vinfast now, given the fact the Tesla Model Y is now cheaper (in fact, the 7-seat interior on the Model Y is only $4000 more than the 5-seat interior)?
 I am also curious who would buy the Vinfast over the Tesla Model Y, if any, outside of Vietnam, and what measures Vinfast would need to address to succeed, or they would fail regardless?
 For me, I do think Vinfast should just halve their price to be competitive:
 The Vinfast VF 8 could be $29k trying to steal market share from the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5/CX-50, Hyundai Santa Fe/Tucson, Kia Sorento/Sportage, Nissan Rogue, Mitsubishi Outlander, Subaru Forester, etc.
 The Vinfast VF 9 could be $42k trying to steal market share from the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Mazda CX-9, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Nissan Pathfinder, Subaru Ascent, Chevy Traverse, Ford Explorer, etc.
 I am actually Vietnamese by the way, born in Vietnam and currently living in the US and after seeing Tesla prices drop, if I had to choose between the Tesla Model Y and the Vinfast VF 8, I would choose the Tesla Model Y Long Range. Also, a review of the 'quirks and features' of the Vinfast VF 8 will be coming soon as I am heading to Montreal this weekend to film a video over at the Vinfast store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I am currently working on writing a novel in which one of the main characters is Vietnamese-American. He was raised in a family culture that is supposed to be relatively traditional as per Vietnamese values and lifestyle, so I'm trying to do some research into what that looks like, especially in everyday life.
 So here's my question: are there any particular details or things I should include to make traditional Vietnamese life feel accurate and respectful? Are there any potentially harmful stereotypes I should avoid? I want to get a more direct authority on the subject than decades old library books and internet articles. Thanks in advance for your help!

 Facebook basically ate up every chat log and every low res videos that provided zero context whatsoever, then people started taking it on Reddit and Twitter. I've never laugh so hard on such a clownfest. Heck, I can even pretend to leak a Zalo chatlog saying "Oh I'm a relative of the two students on the press conference today, they were forced to answer in favor of "the upper people" " and people would gobble them up like a bowl of warm soup.

 I want to clarify that I do not wish to spread misinformation, but it is important that we put pressure on the military school, the university itself (HUFLIT) and the media to be fully transparent about the situation.
 Many posts on Facebook and Twitter related to this have been removed after the incident blew up on social media.
 According to an official statement in a press conference from the military school, this incident was a conflict between female students, with one of them accused of stealing, causing her to breakdown and scream. Later on, her family came to pick her up.
 There are also 2 female students present at the conference: one of them filming the video and the other one being the suppo…]]></summary>

Why is there no name mentioned in the story? I mean not just the confession but all the messages, voice chats and videos that are claimed to be related to it. Isn't that too strange? Especially when some claimed one of the supposed victims is well known by many people and has a father who's a general. How come her name not mentioned even once?
 
The details of the story changed by a lot. Initially it was claimed that a teacher was passing by before discovering the incident and saving the girls (there was a suprisingly lack of details on how he confronted the rapists and saved the girls). Then somehow the story changed from 2 girls being caught on the road to being brought into a room by an off…]]></summary>

We're both foreigners: I'm American while she's Vietnamese. The process requires a lot of paperwork most of the difficult part coming from her side.
 We've run into a snag where it seems her local Vietnamese government is asking for documentation about me before issuing the documents she needs from them. Though according to her my documents aren't required and it's just the government being stupid.
 Does anyone here have experience getting the Giấy xác nhận tình trạng hôn nhân and Giấy xác nhận chưa thụ lý đăng ký kết hôn when marrying a foreigner? Did you need documents for them in order to get these documents?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[TW - rape, suicide]
 Recently there have been stories on Vietnamese Facebook about female students being supposedly raped by other male soldiers at a military school, where they had to go and stay 2 weeks for military training (which is compulsory for most university students in Vietnam). After the assault, there has also been rumors that 2 of them has attempted to commit suicide, with 1 of them successfully killing herself.
 The first video is the screams during the incident. When the girl screamed for help, it could be heard that one of the guy shouted 'Banh rộng chân ra', which roughly means 'Spread your legs out'.
 The second one is the body being carried away after one of the students committed suicide.
 After the stories went viral on Facebook, the military school published a notice about the subject passing it off as 'internal conflict' and that 'no harm was caused'. The official Facebook page of the university (HUFLIT) has posted this document on their offical pages.
 Other images are messages from the fellow students at the school.

I recently found out that Ha Dong used be part of a now defunct province called Ha Tay which was absorbed by Ha Noi in 2008 creating the city we know today. I often drive through Nguyen Trai street to Ha Dong and I often wonder what was the actual border between the two cities prior to 2008? Its hard to tell since most of the area between Ha Noi and Ha Dong has been built up over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I have been trying to do my part in learning about Tet. I really love the culture. I was invited this year to go on a trip with my husbands family (who moved here along with my husband from vietnam only a few years ago), to participate in a more cultural lunar new year than their typical. They live in america, and since moving here they just stay home for the holiday. It seems that they are very excited to go on this trip, and i want to show my appreciation in any way possible. There is a strong language barrier between us, we mostly only communicate through my husband. I am wondering, what are some possible gifts i can bring them to show them my appreciation? I have done my research, but as an outsider i do not want to overstep and i feel a little insecure about giving them traditional gifts. I need to know if this is just me. For example, would it be overstepping if i wore a red dress? Or would it excite them that i want to participate like that? Would i be weird if i brought them lucky flowers? Any insight at all would be very appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like history, and I also know that the war waged in Vietnam is one of the biggest tragedies in the 20th century. Recently I came to know about a documentary about it made by Ken Burns. I want to know if someone here watched it and what is your opinion on that documentary.
 Edit: I think it's somewhat stupid to say "Vietnam War". Sounds like the fault is yours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year will be the first Tet with my boyfriend, he's Vietnamese and I'm white. He used to celebrate pretty heavily with his immediate and extended family when he was younger, but the whole family has since stopped celebrating like they used to and I want to start up the celebrations again with him this year since I think it could be really nostalgic for him. I plan to decorate and cook, but what about gifts?
 I know that traditionally gifts of money are usually given to younger members of the family, so would it be weird if I got him a gift? I just really love gift giving and will look for any excuse to get him presents, but I don't want it to be weird if it seems inappropriate for this particular holiday. If it wouldn't be weird, what are some possible gift ideas that would be fitting? He really loves white tea, hates sweet things, and is always appreciative of plants if that helps.
 I remember him fondly reminiscing on the fun of red envelopes, and since it would be kind of awkward to give him money I had the idea of using the red envelopes to make a scavenger hunt for him. Thoughts on this idea? Too weird? Brutal honesty is appreciated, I'm still learning but it's hard to get an idea of what he would enjoy for Tet without spoiling the surprise of all my plans
 Thanks so much for any and all help!

This involves me lying face down in the water (using a snorkel and mask). Of course this will look odd to anyone who isn’t familiar with freediving and in the few instances I’ve had of actually trying this resulted in either getting shouted at by the lifeguard or they simply don’t allow anything that isn’t circuit or lane swimming. 
 How would I ask about whether I could do some freedive practice on the surface? My practice partner relies on me speaking Vietnamese for stuff but I don’t know how to say this.

She said of course, (I've tutored her daughters and we've visited together before). Afterwards they invited us in for drinks (it was just my husband and I and her, her husband and kids), and now she says they've had great luck this past year (good health, built a big new house, etc.) so she would like us to be officially invited for the evening this year lol. At the big new house they built. 
 Last time was just spur of the moment. I get a bit overwhelmed about the times during Tet when you do the specific things etc - I was just wondering if I should prepare a gift that would be "lucky"? She's always been helpful and friendly to us, but I'd like to show my appreciation in a culturally appropriate way. For example, I only recently learnt that you can't give certain flowers (the yellow chrysanthemum) as gifts, though luckily I've never done that. Would just like to know if there's a "special" gift that would be appreciated. Feel quite honored to be invited to be the first into her home in the new year!

I am a seasoned backpacker and really wanting great food and culture (for context I'm from Melbourne), I will also be travelling with my mum for a period who's VERY Korean but want some nice experiences. Struggling to find a travel blog or anything online I'm really resonating so hoping this community can give me some insights. 
 Food wise I would love street food, cool bars, places where locals eat and drink, areas where younger tourists go to socialise, where young locals go to socialise. 
 Is it worth doing a few days elsewhere? 
 Sorry, I know i'm asking a lot but any type of response will be gladly appreciated. Much love!

He seemed to be posting pretty frequently up until about 2 weeks ago when everything stopped. No updates from his Facebook page, and his YouTube account seems to have been deleted. I just want to make sure he's ok. Although he was doing a good thing, it's still a very risky venture in Vietnam. I'm curious what happened. Does anyone know anything?

 For context is, the relative open a chocolate shop in Saigon and it isn't doing well. She commented that Vietnamese doesn't like chocolate as much as coffee.
 Any insights to why choco is less favourable ?

We already have our stay booked in Hanoi, a cruise in Ha Long Bay and we have a list of places (mostly popular tourist attractions) which we would like to visit. I was hoping if you guys could give any tips and advises for our trip? Is there anything that we must see, any dishes we should try (I am aware of Egg Coffee, Pho and Bun Cha which we can get in Hanoi)? Is there anything that we should be cautious of (any scams etc.)?
 We are all very excited to come to Vietnam and explore it! Any advice will be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I have an odd question. One of my neighbors is Vietnamese, and we live in the United States.
 I've been noticing at night a red light in their living room. They do not have curtains. It looks like 2 urns? And some other things that I can't make out. It looks like it's in a case of some sort. And there is 2 red lights on at all times, from what I can tell. 
 I was thinking it could be for a reptile, because I was going to offer them some of my old reptile keeping items, but my husband reminded me that they are Vietnamese and it could be a cultural thing. 
 I don't want to be rude by assuming, so is this something done in your culture? 
 Thank you all so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m travelling to Hanoi this mid March to spend 5 nights as my first ever solo travel! 
 I’m 25f, enjoys nature a lot, meeting people, and good food. I wanted to ask your personal recommendations on which spots I shouldn’t miss? From food, to nearby spots?
 The places I’m eyeing to visit are: - About 1-2 days in Hanoi - Hoi An - Ninh Binh - And Ha Long Bay.
 Questions:
  
Would it be good to spend 1 day in each town?
 What would be a good itinerary?
 Is Ha Long Bay worth it? Other towns you love?
 Food/ restos I shouldn’t miss in these places?
  
Thank you so much! ❤️

One is in duong dong town and the other one is in an thoi at the very southern tip of the island. Which one would be more convenient? We like to eat so does the west side have more restaurants than the south? We will be flying in but plan to do a boat tour to visit surrounding islands also.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pho is one of my favourite dishes. If it is not one of yours then there is something fundamentally wrong with you! I know its sensible to parboil your bones first to remove any impurities and get a clearer broth. However is it acceptable/correct to roast the bones first? This is pretty standard practice when making a broth in the west but I believe in doing things properly.

 I went out to the grocery store and some Vietnamese came to and told me he have some “pretty girls” and tried to show me some of their photos. I refused to him of course and went into the store but he took a picture of me and sent it to someone. It was very creepy! Has it happened to someone here? Why did he do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What social/cultural/political developments led to Vietnam becoming less authoritarian than China?
 Vietnam has access to Western sites while China blocks most. 
 China cares about policing the internet more than Vietnam, and China cares about policing cultural works than Vietnam. Yes, Vietnamese movies have some serious censorship but at least they can still make ghost movies and homosexual relationship content.
 Vietnamese leaders can more easily accept criticism from their citizens while Chinese leaders are less tolerant of criticism. Vietnam’s security minister was criticized for eating at a Salt Bae restaurant in London and had to resign. In China, many major scandals are heavily censored and covered up.
 What reasons make the Vietnamese government less authoritarian and more humane than the Chinese government?
 If it’s a case of losing authority? Why is the Vietnamese government more prone to make decisions that risk their authority than the Chinese government is?
 Is the higher humaneness of the Vietnamese government stemming from cultural reasons?
 Vietnam is still repressive and has one of the world’s worst press freedom scores, but the fact that they have access to all Western sites and more political accountability is a clear sign that it is much less authoritarian than China.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I just got engaged two months ago, I’ve been thinking about getting a customized ao dai for both my fiancé and I for our wedding. I’m located in the US and was wondering how much is a customized ao dai over in VT? My mom is currently visiting Da Nang and she went around looking for ao dais and couldn’t find anything to her/my liking, she told me that the colors and prints are for the spring season or for tet. I don’t mind waiting since I’m still planning my wedding, I don’t need it right away but just want to look and find the print and fabric that I like. She also told me the cost for two ao dais are roughly $500-$600 US dollars, does this cost sound right? I told my mom I don’t mind paying for that price but she kept telling me that it’s expensive. If anyone has any recommendations for places for a customized ao dais I would really appreciate it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, so I’m travelling to Vietnam next week and there are some things I’m worried about. 
 I’m currently on medication and I’m curious if I’m allowed to bring that into Vietnam? Do I need some kind of receipt or certification from my doctor to prove that the medicine belongs to me? I’m scared they’ll seize it at the airport.
 I’m also a very physically active person, and I plan on working out while I’m in Saigon. I’m taking creatine, and I have been pretty consistent with it so I don’t wanna stop now. I want to bring it to Vietnam but I’m a bit nervous. It’s a white powder. What if they think it’s cocaine and they confisticate it? But I’m guessing they have trained dogs for that?
 Maybe I’m taking this too seriously. I’m on vacation and I should enjoy it, and not think so much about the gym. What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to recall some of the stuffs I have read during this period of time. Some of the literature was of Viet origin. But some wasn't. I finally remembered series like Animorphs, Ngũ quái Sài Gòn, etc.
 In particular, I recalled reading some teen mystery/detective book. I could have been written before the 90s. But I remember reading it in the late 90s to either 2000/2001. There is not much more to go on. Outside of the fact that I know it isn't Sherlock Holmes, Detective Conan, or TKKG (another series that I was searching for). Hope you guys can help. Thank in advance. I am sure there should only be a handful of series and or books about teenage detectives during this time.

The timeline seems a little rushed, and it would be nice to leave the weekend before. Unfortunately taking more time off afterwards isn't an option due to work deadlines, so it would have to be before. But since Tet is on Jan 22, would it be a waste of two days of PTO to leave on Jan 21 instead of Jan 25, since everything might be closed?

 Do you have any suggestion for local independent or underground culture, especially in HCMC and Hanoi? Artist run spaces and collectives, experimental music (new music, noise, electronic, performance/sound art), cultural/social projects for local independent artists and musicians, queer communities, etc? 
 Although I won't miss some obvious touristic spot I would like to see and support some of the local scene. Never been in Vietnam so I don't know what to expect :)

 I'm in Hanoi with my fiancee and we're looking for a USB C to HDMI cable so I can connect my phone to the TV at the hotel we're staying at. I've gone to a few shops in the Old Quarter and came back empty.
 I'll be away until Monday evening but would love if there's a way to order one and have it shipped to the hotel on the weekend or Monday. The concierge at the hotel tried but was unsuccessful.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends! Next week I’m travelling to Vietnam with my mother and we’ll be staying there for three weeks. Last time I went to Vietnam was in 2015 so I’m pretty excited. 
 We’ll be spending the first week in Saigon, second week at my grandparents to celebrate Tet, and the third week in Phu Quoc Island. 
 There is one thing I’m worried about and that’s losing my phone. I’m worried about getting it stolen while in Saigon. It’s pretty crowded there so I’m a bit paranoid. 
 My phone is super important to me so I don’t wanna lose it. I’ll be wearing a fanny pack and I want to take a lot of photos and record videos while I’m there. 
 That’s also the problem. What if someone walks past me and snatches my phone while I’m recording? Or if someone on a motorcycle drives by and snatches it.
 When I was in Vietnam in 2015, I was just a child so I didn’t have a phone at the time so there was nothing to worry about. Anyone got some advice? What should I think about? 
 I’d also appreciate suggestions on nice restaurants and places to visit!

I won’t be doing any off road trails and plan on travelling the north and venturing into Laos and Cambodia after. 99% of the time I’ll be travelling without a passenger. I’m 185cm(6’0) & 75kg(165lbs); I’ll be carrying around 10kg of luggage. I’m leaning towards the future 125: It’s semi auto, lighter than the 150 and the parts are more widely available. Is the 125 sufficient or would you recommend the 150?

We are currently up to date with Hep A, Tetanus, Rabies and Typhoid, as well as the usual vaccines you get as a child in the UK (Mumps, Measles, Rubella, Polio, HPV) Is there anything else that anyone would recommend? We can't currently find anywhere that is offering Japanese Encephalitis vaccinations, so I'm also wondering if we will be safe to travel without this one? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is this a common thing in Vietnam? I admittedly haven't been travelling a whole lot since the pandemic so haven't been paying much attention to other places. But it seems a lot businesses have what look to be obviously fake 5 star reviews on google maps, far more so than other places (Mostly accounts that have only given 1 review ever). It's hard to gauge what businesses are reliable, as it seems so many businesses do it, even ones that are 'good' or have been around for a long time. I've also seen a few 1 start reviews that seem like smears, which may somewhat explain why businesses try to counter it
 Are there other websites people check to find how reliable a business is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone, I (30s F) will be visiting Vietnam for about three weeks this mid- February. I'm looking for a travel buddy for activities such as hiking, walking, cultural exploration, volunteer, eco friendly tour... if you are planning to travel around Hanoi and througout Vietnam during this time and want more company, please let me know. I will be based in Hanoi and ideally looking for day trip, or out of town 2-4 days then ilback to Hanoi. 
 I was born and grew up in the Old Quarter of Hanoi but have been living oversea since 19yo. I still have many friends and family in Vietnam. I just visited Vietnam end of last year so have catched up on most family/friends and gatherings. I also realized my recreational interests have changed now (probably due to age and living in NZ) and more into activities such as town/market walk around, hiking, walking track, cultural experience...my friends in VN will just take me to a cool cafe or new restaurant everytime and i have started to feel I have enough of it. 
 So if you are like-minded, I would love to hear from you.

In Vietnam is there a way to get near the Chinese ‘borderline’ (not the actual passport control etc) but just so i can say that i’ve been to the border and maybe take a cool picture without being in a vehicle having to actually cross the border? Just thought it would be quite cool. This could be completely impossible but was just curious, thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi! my mom is from rural southern vietnam, and my dad is from hue. i grew up in the U.S. and am pretty detached from my roots. i never learned the language, and most of my vietnamese friends are the same way.
 my mom made a comment last week that made me wonder about the regional stereotypes in vietnam. she said that she originally never wanted to marry someone from hue because she thought they were stingy and cheap with money. i can also tell that there’s many differences in food preference, accent, personality, etc.
 what are some other differences and stereotypes between the regions in vietnam? is there a difference between rural and urban southerners as well? my parents often joke about my mom is a farm girl at heart, so i’d love to know.

I suppose they're trying to cut budget (or encourage us to work more??). What's your take on this? Is this even legal according to the labour laws for foreigners in VN?
 Please note: I'm not naming and shaming, I just want to have a better understanding of this so I can weight my options (either to stay or leave).
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just returned home after 3-ish years in a god forsaken frozen corn field and noticed that there are now these yellow license plates everywhere. They're on buses, taxis, ubers/grabs, trucks, etc. I also noticed that some of the yellow plates also have "contract vehicle" (xe hợp đồng) stickered somewhere on the frame or windows.
 ​
 What do these yellow plates mean? Are they like company/corporate vehicles or something? The one commonality I can find is that they are all work/commercial vics of some sort (as opposed to private/personal transport).
 ​
 I could have sworn that there weren't these yellow plates back before I left. I'm almost certain that back then all the taxis, busses, and grabs still used the normal white plates. Did something change while I was away freezing my ass off?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone As the title suggests, I am loving my time in Vietnam, except for the bureaucratic headache of dealing with my lost luggage. 
 Simply put, on 26 December 2022, my luggage did not arrive, and I followed all the usual steps of filling out a lost luggage form, and notifying my original airline, JetStar. Of course, JetStar is blaming Vietnam airlines, who connected my flight from Saigon to Hanoi. I am now trying to submit a compensation claim with Vietnam Airlines, but all the resources point me to the general information and the form, which I have already filled out. My question is simply what email address do I contact/who do I send my claim to at Vietnam Airlines?
 I’m already past the 7 day notification period but given my deadlings with tracing and that I’ve been out of reception for much of my time here I’m hopeful I can shake them down. 
 Thanks so much.

However I have a really good job offer in Ben Tre and I would like to hear some opinions about living in Ben Tre as a foreigner who for now doesn’t speak Vietnamese (I want to learn but it will take some time tho)
 I’m aware it is a beautiful area of Vietnam but I wonder how foreigner-friendly is a not as big city as Saigon is and if the cost of living is higher/lower and some other aspects to take in consideration that you can think of.
 Any help is welcome! Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time ago I had dinner at a restaurant in NYC called Le Colonial. It was a high-end Viet-French Fusion kind of place. The dish I had was called Bo Sate. It was beyond good and I've not been able to forget about it. I want so badly to be able to make it at home.
 It was made with beef tenderloin (Bo), and had a sauce (Sate?) which included sweet potatoes and green string beans. My search for Bo Sate recipes only turns up Thai sate recipes, which is not the same.
 I really appreciate any hints or suggestions you can offer.

 I’m looking to move somewhere else in Asia after having lived in Thailand for 4 years. I wonder how it’s like to live in Vietnam in terms of access to international food like imported beef and other groceries, can they be found in the supermarkets there? How long does the visa on arrival last? Are the prices on food and living generally low compared to in western countries? What about transportation, is it advisable to rent a motorbike? Are the hospitals and healthcare up to the same or similar standards as in Thailand? Are fitness centres well equipped with modern machines?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a mortgage for an apartment that started at 9.1%. every year they increased by about 1 or 2% which I wasn't so happy but it was in my tolerant level so I didn't complain. Tonight I just received a message that this year it would be 15.4%, up from 12.9 from last year. I don't have the contract right now but I will check later to see if this is even legal. I remember there maybe some thing like maximum increment of 2% a year. The bank is TPB btw.
 Is this a normal thing? Is the rate too high for current market? Is there anything I should do?
 Update: thank you everyone, this looks like a market thing. I hope everyone is doing well financially. These rates really suck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing a story in which a foreigner will be reading part of a Nguyen Trai poem in Vietnamese. The poem is Bình Ngô đại cáo. The passage I have selected is this:
 Nguỵ đảng hoài gian, cánh dĩ mãi ngã quốc.
 Hân thương sinh ư ngược diệm,
 Hãm xích tử ư họa khanh.
 Khi thiên võng dân, quỷ kế cái thiên vạn trạng;
 I have a two questions about this. The first is about translations. I don't trust Google Translate and it's hard to track down a good translation online. Can anyone help?
 The second question might be harder. I want the foreigner to mispronounce one of the words so that it changes the meaning to something kind of funny. Are there any words in there that could change to something silly if they are spoken with the wrong tone? 
 I can always choose a different passage if this one doesn't work, but I want the content of the poem to be about war.

As a foodie, I'm fascinated with all the food shops, restaurants, stalls in Hanoi. I noticed that most of the restaurants are generally 100% women-lead from cooking to servicing and to billing. Why? The rare exception I noticed so far are restaurants 100% ruled and managed by men, and these are thai-ish food related and generally by stylish men. Is there any sort of explanation? Thanks :)

 This is going to be our third time visiting Việt Nam. Until now, we mostly used air planes and trains. This time we would like to spend more time, so we would like to go in smaller steps to see more places. It seems the usual way to travel is by bus. How does the bus system work in general and after Covid? Is there one public transportation system or are there also privat companies. Would you also take taxies into account? When should we use which kind of transportation? Our route currently looks like the following:
 Sài Gòn -> Mỹ Tho -> Cần Thơ -> Sài Gòn -> Phan Thiết and Phan Rang <-> Đà Lạt <-> Buôn Ma Thuột -> Tuy Hòa -> Quy Nhơn -> Pleiku -> Kon Tum -> Hôi An and Đà Nẵng (<-> denotes that the order is not yet decided)
 Our plan is to take the train where applicable.
 Though, this is only the first half of our route as we would like to continue our route to Hà Nội in a similar style for another 30 days, but we have not looked into it too much yet. We hope this is a reasonable route to travel.

 We've already spent a few days in Hanoi and did Ha Long Bay, and while we love it we don't want to spend another 9 days there after Phu Quoc (leaving on the 13th). I've been looking at Ninh Binh / Tam Coc as an option for a 3 day stay, but all tours seem to leave from Hanoi to that area, and everything I'm reading says to do that area on a scooter but I don't have a bike license and my partner isn't comfortable driving one on her own.
 Is finding local tours easy in that area?. Any other suggestions for the north of Vietnam?. We're not the backpacking types, both middle aged and enjoy a certain amount of comfort :)
 Thanks!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I came down from central VN to Saigon for the weekend with my family. We stayed in an apartment at VinHomes Central Park, largely because it was convenient to get to the NYE fireworks on the river. Like, a ten minute walk. Along with a large crowd, we waited for the midnight fireworks to start. 
 And waited... and waited... and waited...
 At 12:20, we gave up and took the kids back to the apartment. When we got back, I turned on the TV and loaded the live stream of the Saigon fireworks. Nothing but streams of people leaving the riverside.
 When I got up this morning, I checked the local news, hoping to find an explanation. One news site, VN Express, had a glowing report of the festivities in HCMC along with photos of the "fireworks display":
 Vietnam rings in 2023
 This was the only reference I could find, so I've started the new year off with a mystery.

 Since January 2020, the Đài Tiếng nói Việt Nam article consistently blows out all daily viewership metrics:
  
February 2020 -- narrowly beats front page with 32k views.
 
March 2020 -- destroys it with 50k hits over 30k
 
August 2021 -- 3rd after front page and Taliban
 
April 2022 -- dwarfs everything else with 81k views. The next non-special article is about a dude named Tô Anh Dũng has measly 11k.
 
December 2022 -- still going strong with a 2nd place after front page
 
 I don't think it ever left top 3 for the past three years, no other article across the entire wikimedia comes even close.
 Is it tradition to read about Voice of Vietnam during breakfast, or did some popular site embed the article into their front page somehow? Any inside would be greatly appreciated 👐

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife (Canadian) and I (British) are going on our honeymoon to Vietnam, but intend to visit Thailand for a few days midway, before returning to Vietnam for the last portion before flying home. 
 The official guidance for British citizens is that 15 days single entry is allowed without a visa, then you have to wait 30 days till you try to enter again. I've seen claims that the "30 days untill you re-enter" rule isn't really enforced and that you can just re-enter again on the 15 day rule, but I'm not sure I want to test that theory based on unsubstantiated claims...
 So my plan currently is to use the 15 days for the first entry, then apply for an E-Visa as soon as I get to Vietnam, print it somewhere, and use it when I re-enter Vietnam the second time from Thailand. 
 Do any British people have experience leaving and returning to Vietnam as a tourist in one trip? What did you do?

I need to leave early because I have a huge trip the next day.
 Question: What should I bring to their house and should I stop by if I can’t stay for very long?

 I'm not biased, just interested in hearing inspiring or cynical stories, either is good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I come from a developing country that can be compared to Vietnam in many ways. But the main difference is the apparent tolerance of the state/authorities to informal businesses, eg street food. Are informal small business tolerated or encouraged ? Is there any form of corruption involved? How does the state collect taxes ? What is the size of the grey economy? How important is a business registration? 
 
Most restaurants, even small and apparently informal ones, have a PoS management software, and many print a receipt. I often see small business managers using calculators and apparently doing their accounting. Similar restaurants/business in my country usually don't even have a logbook (combination of illiteracy and bad management). I know that Vietnam mostly got rid of illiteracy decades ago, but I feel that there's more to this than just knowing how to read and write.
 
I mostly think of the vietnamese as one of the most industrious people on the planet. But on rare occasions, i meet people that seem even lazier than my countrymen, usually the younger ones. Especially in cafés, waiters seem incredibly slow and unprofessional. What's happening here ? What am I missing?
 
 Sorry if my questions are ingenuous. I just want to better understand the vietnamese society.

 Names we have considered are Minh Anh and Tuan Anh. Tho, I find Minh Anh to be more on the feminine side. 
 I like the two word names with Anh being the second one if possible (a family thing) , but not necessary. Any other suggestions?

Can you get one without the other? I was born in VN and have my birth certificate but did not have a passport as I entered USA under my parents passport (5 years old).
 What do I need to do to get dual citizenship. Keep in mind that I would not be able to obtain any documents pertaining my parents as they do not want me to get dual citizenship. I have family in VN also.

I thought this was somewhat absurd and I stated matter-of-factly that Ho Chi Minh booted France out of Vietnam but he acted like that was a bad thing. His uncle fought with US soldiers and they were exiled to Singapore. He's basically grown up in Vietnam though but he's trying very hard to come to America.

 We've been close friends for nearly five years. They've taught me a lot about antisemitism (they're half jewish) and about Vietnamese culture.
 Recently, we've been getting into some arguments about their behavior and general attitude toward our friendship. I try to be as openminded and a good listening ear but I'm not sure how to pick out what is and isn't "okay" for them to say. (For clarity, I'm autistic and I cannot for the life of me discern some things as excuses and others as real reasons. I err on the side of caution and take everything as a reason but recently I've had a gut feeling about that being the wrong approach.)

No one care about protect the nature & animal eviroment . I mean wtf they learn at school ? It 2023 already and people still throw beer can on the street
 People celebrate new year , make sure u guy check the aftermatch in the working street. It alway a huge trash behind .

My planned route will take me up north from Hanoi, more specifically NW,N&NE. I’m staying away from the “tourist cities”, so I’m aware that a vast majority of interactions will be with locals. Apart from good manners and common sense, is there anything else I should know to stay polite and respectful to the locals? Perhaps a couple phrases in Vietnamese etc etc.

I've tried doing some research on it, but I can't find much about queer couples specifically. (Note, these characters do live in America, however my MC would like to incorporate his mother's traditions into the wedding.)
 For reference, my MC (main character) is Vietnamese and his LI (love interest) is white.

 I will be visiting Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam this upcoming Fall and was wondering if there are any local fashion brands that I should check out? I heard that it is not worth shopping for global brands so I am more interested in shopping locally. 
 The style I am looking for is casual loungewear/active wear, but looking for thick/plush materials that would not pill, fade, and is soft. I typically avoid any loud patterns or colors and enjoy more neutrals. Brands that I think of as an example of the style I am going for is PANGAIA, Gymshark, Alphalete, etc.
 Thank you!

From what I can hear him yell, he broken something of the dog and did something to the dogs teeth, possibly causing it to severely bleed. The dog was wimping and crying very loudly as I can hear my neighbor with his wife and children messing up the dog. I live basically next door with the window right above his house. I need to know if there is any practical way of reporting him for "Animal Abuse". There has to be some way to make him stop as I very much cannot stand the situation.
 Due to obstruction, the videos I have do not contain any images, but the auditory evidence is very clear.
 I live in Phu Quoc, if that affects anything.
 Please give advices, I am only a highschooler and most other members in my family seems like they won't do much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, overseas viet in hcmc on vacation. I'm looking for cheap souvenirs (keychains, fold cards, magnets, totes) for myself and friends. The prices at the central post office seem high so are there any good alternatives? I'm a little wary on ben thanh and am able to venture to other markets like binh tay if they are better. 
 Also, I'm looking to spend NYE in district 1 tomorrow. where would the fireworks be launched or the viewing area? also, any tips for tomorrow (crowds, preparedness)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be visiting soon from Bangkok for a weekend to Hanoi and am looking for any shops that sell local artists works. Not so much the stuff you’ll find in tourist shops but stickers, keychains, postcards and prints that are made by the youth and subcultures of Hanoi. Skater culture and coffee culture shops here usually sell that kind of merch. Even “cute” style designs I don’t mind. Just want to support young artists. I’m staying near the French Quarter and the lake. Thank you in advance.

I can't help but wonder whether this beautiful and romantic trash is ending up polluting the sea or if there are measures in place to remove them beforehand.
 Somebody knows something?

She is currently not doing well having failed two math exams what I would like to know is is she does not pass her math exams throughout the year do they not pass her to the next grade and make her repeat the year over or do they make her do summer school to pass the math grade? Curious as the tutor we got her now seems to be useless in helping her do better. Thanks

 What is your current job and your most recent previous job in Vietnam? What city/district is the job in and how did you land the job? 
 I'm curious for my job search what jobs and positions/roles other expats have and how you got it. Not to mention is it with a local company or international company? I'm looking to see how others went about getting their lives started in Vietnam
 If you have any stories on the timeframe it took for you, how long you've been there and what times you applied that were peak performance hours for applications for jobs I'd love to hear your stories! Thanks friends and stay safe!

In two months time I’ll be travelling to Vietnam, where I plan on purchasing a motorcycle to travel south east Asia on. I’ve narrowed down my search to two models, Honda Wave & Winner. I’ll be landing in Hanoi, where I’ll stay for a couple days sorting out the motorbike and logistics. Although I’m keen on buying one of these two models, I’ll buy whatever’s available to me once I’m there. My question is as follows: are there any well known websites, forums, social media groups, companies etc where travellers and organisations sell their/these motorbikes?

I saw that drones with cameras aren't allowed but I've seen footage in air of Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently an American ESL teacher based in Saigon took to social platforms to expose the truth about the rampant sexual harrasment in a Vietnamese High School (Nguyen Thi Dieu).
 1/Upon seeing a female highschooler being forced to remove her jacket and inappropriately touched by a security guard at school, Teacher Kenny apparently stood up for her by using physical force against the guard. Kenny was furious and was asking for an investigation as this has happened numerous times before with other students. 
 2/There is CCTV footage documenting the guard being inapproprate with students in his office : forcing them to undress to check their nametag, inappropriate touching and groping female students. The school board forced everyone to stay silent and threatened to destroy Kenny's teaching career in Saigon if he went on to draw attention to the case. The guard, on the other hand, only got off with a warning. 
 3/Teacher Kenny has since spoken up about the incident on many social sites such as Tiktok and Facebook, students who are former victims of harrassment by the guard are also speaking up and trying to gain traction for the case.
 4/The Vietnamese English teacher, however, is bribing students with exam points if they stay silent or inform her about the ones who side with Kenny on social media. She called students "stupid" for siding with a "white westerner", threatened various UNDERAGE students for making tiktoks defending the victims and teachers. An adult woman who is an educator is going around spreading racism and threatening minors.
 Here's a link to Kenny's tiktok : https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS86jpE2w/

 I will be flying from California to Việt Nam in January for Tet and plan to bring many electronic gifts (like 5 laptops, 5 iPhones, 5 Apple Watches). I imagine the wise thing to do is just place all of them in a check-in container and pick up at the destination. I was wondering if there would be a problem if i placed a single laptop, watch and iPhone in my carry-on. 
 Thank you in advance for any advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I will be traveling to VietNam early next year. I have a severe seafood (more so finned fish, but contamination is a concern) and brazil nut allergy and I was hoping to get some insight into how I would communicate that in Vietnamese if I need to.
 I looked it up through Google Translate, but I find that it is often not very accurate. If anyone has any advice on pronunciation that would be helpful too, as I find that more difficult as a native English speaker.
 I'm not sure how to phrase it best either, so if anyone has advice regarding that it would be great. I am thinking it would be best to keep it simple, just something like "No seafood/brazil nuts, I die" or "I will die".
 So far something I have thought of trying is to print out an allergy card with the information on it, but I think it may be good to get other suggestions as well. 
 Any suggestions are helpful, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I was wondering if anyone has tried the fried chicken at Lotteria in Vietnam and what your thoughts were on it. Personally, I've tried all the big international chains like KFC, Popeyes, and Jollibee, and I have to say that none of them hold a candle to the deliciousness of Lotteria's fried chicken.
 The chicken at Lotteria is always fresh and tender, and the marinade they use is just the right balance of herbs and spices. Plus, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. In comparison, the chicken at the other fast food chains I've tried has been either dry or cold, or both. It's just not the same level of quality as what you'll find at Lotteria.
 Now, I will admit that the rest of the menu at Lotteria leaves something to be desired. The sides are pretty mediocre and the sandwiches and burgers are just okay. And the desserts? Well, let's just say they're not exactly worth writing home about. But despite all that, the chicken at Lotteria is still worth the visit (or delivery) in my opinion.
 So I'm curious to hear what others think - have you tried the fried chicken at Lotteria? What were your thoughts? Is it worth the visit (or delivery)? And if anyone knows of a better fried chicken place in Vietnam, I'd love to hear about it!

 We (my wife and I) are currently in Vietnam, enjoying the country thorougly and planning our next steps. In a few days, we’ll head to the middle of Vietnam, and after that likely to the South. 
 However, it seems the weather won’t be that good for the middle & the south, especially in the region of Da Nang and Nha Trang.
 Also, Phu Quoc seems to get pretty rainy, which was basically our ‘end of holiday’ getaway. 
 Do we need to consider going abroad (say Thailand, Phuket - looking more stable over the course of 2 weeks), or are weather forecasts in Vietnam generally wrong? Would love to hear from you!

I plan to show it to wait staff… I’m looking for it to say “I have a severe allergy. I can't eat shrimp, crab, lobster, oysters, squid, octopus and shellfish. I can't eat food cooked in the same oil as shellfish. I can't eat sauces made with shellfish (like oyster sauce) or fish sauce with shellfish”

I swear I found an online link to upload my paperwork a few month ago. Does anyone know how can I find the link to apply online instead of mailing because I can’t find it anywhere now.
  
Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am Vietnamese on my moms side and there is a lot of drama between my family in my home country and my family in Vietnam over inheritances and what not. It has reached the point that both sides refuse to talk to each other. 
 However, much to my annoyance, my generation (those born outside of Vietnam) are purposely being kept out of the loop. It doesn't help that I don't speak the language and that my family just blatantly discussess all of this right in front of me, knowing that I can't follow the conversation. The only tidbits of info I get are from eavesdropping on my mother when she is trying to explain the mess to my father.
 When I communicated my chagrin concerning me being kept clueless, my mom explained to me that in Vietnam fights are being kept isolated within the generation and that none of this will affect me, because I am from the next generation.
 Is this a thing in Vietnam or am i being told a bunch of nonsense? Personally, I would prefer to remain on friendly terms with my family in Vietnam.

 A friend and I want to go out of Romania, where we live, on a 3 weeks long trip, and Vietnam will probably be our destination.
 My simple plan is to fly to Hanoi and rent an apartment in the city center. After that, we could split our time between discovering Hanoi at a very relaxed pace and going on daytrips such as these: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293924-Activities-c63-Hanoi.html
 We are open to splitting our times between multiple places in Vietnam, or maybe cutting our time here short and spending a week in Kuala Lumpur or Tokyo, but it seems like a hassle.
 What would you do?

 I have about 1.5 weeks left in Vietnam until I have to go back home. I'm looking for some recommendations on where I should visit this time of the year, or just in general! I'm currently staying with family in HCM, so anywhere drivable is fine but I also don't mind flying somewhere a bit further. So far I have been to: HCM, Sapa, Can Tho, Ha Long, and Ha Noi
 In the past I have also been to Nha Trang and Dalat. 
 I am considering Hoi An. Also would love recommendations for good night markets in the HCM area, or areas with great street food in general! Thanks in advance.

 I will be traveling with my wife and 3 kids (18,16,13) for 2 weeks in March. First time for my wife to come back to Vietnam after she left when she was 6 months old in 1972.
 I am hoping to find a driver for the whole 2 weeks who is willing to travel with us. It would be ideal if they spoke English but that may be a lot to ask? Any thoughts on the best way to find someone?
 Also, because there are 5 of us, AirBnb can sometimes be a good solution. Any reason not to try this route (for example, first 3 nights in Saigon we could get an apartment in District 1). Cost isn't a big issue as I want to make this a memorable trip for everyone. 
 thanks in advance for any and all thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in a smallish town in the South, I am a foreigner and my wife is Vietnamese. I'm pretty embedded in my family and local community and I know that people prefer to handle things "in house" or without the police a lot, but I'm just at a loss.
 The house directly behind ours (their back wall forms the wall of our yard) has a woman who is an absolutely insane and abusive nutcase to her very small child, or maybe children I'm not sure. She screams like a lunatic and hits the poor child, which makes it wail this horrific wail I can't take anymore. It's honestly shameful I haven't done anything yet but I just haven't known what to do and everyone here has a very "mind your own business" attitude so I don't know who to turn to.
 Last week I was afraid that I was listening to her actually killing her child. There was a pained screaming that only comes from death, and then it suddenly cut off to total silence. I remember though that lately I'd heard a puppy, I think she killed the puppy in front of the child. I heard the child sobbing.
 Who do I contact, what branch of government handles investigations like this? Besides the absolutely over the top regular abuse, I feel like if she really did kill that puppy in front of the kid(s) she may one day kill them too. I don't know, I think maybe she has some really intense post-partum psychosis. Due to the layout of the neighborhood I've never actually seen any of them and I don't know what the front of their house looks like.
 I'm very worried and I am at the point that I can't let my moral cowardice get in the way any longer, something needs to be done.
 Can any Vietnamese people here help me? My wife doesn't hear it because she's rarely in the back yard and while she's normally a very lovely person, I don't think she's taking it seriously and may be worried about social blowback.
 Thank you.

 My question is…. Is it possible to get “used” to the heat biologically ? I don’t want tips on how to stay cool… I just want to know if it is possible for my body to get used to the heat if I stay for a certain amount of time. I tend to sweat easily and it seems like stepping outside of my hotel would trigger the sweats. Any advice here? On my trip I just ended up going to Da Lat and other cooler parts of VN.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time visiting Vietnam in March and we will be doing 10 days in the north and trying get some ideas for how we can plan the trip. We want to fit in Ha Giang/Sapa, Ninh Binh, Halong Bay, and Hanoi in but the issue is 10 days is a little tight.
 What do you guys think about the 4 day/3 night option vs 3 day/2 nights for Ha Giang Loop? Is it too rushed to do the 3 day option on QT's website? It allows us to fit Ninh Binh and Halong Bay in a bit easier but I'm a little worried that it'll be too rushed to enjoy the loop.
 The other option is to do Sapa instead of the Ha Giang loop which will definitely make the itinerary easier since I think you can definitely fit Sapa in 3 day/2 nights in very easily.
 Thoughts? Are there any other places you think I should consider and bump one of the options I listed out?
