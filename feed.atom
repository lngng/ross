        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello good people of Vietnam. I fell in love with Saigon when I visited earlier this month, so much so that I am returning for a month early April.
 Aside from bars, coffee shops and language clubs, which I will definitely be making use of this time around, was wondering if anybody had any pointers for a 20-something to make friends in the area
 thank you 🙂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to Hanoi for 5 days and HCMC for 5 days and I'd really appreciate knowing someone there who'd be willing to give me some opinions on places to go and things to do. 
 I'd like to meet a fellow redditor over some drinks and food and hopefully make a new friend during my trip if you're comfortable with that as well. 
 If not, I'd still appreciate the advice 🙂
 EDIT: As an introvert, it's a lot harder for me to make new friends and approach random people and start a conversation which is why I made the post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chams, if I remember right, with the fall of Champa, were separated into three groups practising different religions. The Central Chams have largely retained their Hindu belief, although this is practised under a form called "Ba La Mon". The Southern Chams in the Mekong Delta have largely adhered to Sunni Islam and they are the only ethnic group in Vietnam to be Muslims.
 The third Cham group, however, practise a complex religion called "Bani". It was thought to be traced from Persian traders (Persia/Iran was converted to Shia Islam by Shah Ismail I), who spread their Shia Islam to the community during the Vietnamese shogunates (Trinh-Nguyen). However, Bani is unique that it is so synchronised with other religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and even Han and Kinh (Vietnamese) people's folk traditions that it lost most of the original Islamic belief.
 The Bani community is small today but their religious practise has ignited discussions. Some groups believed that they are actually Muslims but with a different characteristic. But some other (including many Banis) disagree with the classification of Bani as a separate Shia Islam sect and instead insist that they are Banis and not Muslims. There is a 2006 documentary called "A Strange Islam" by Agnes De Feo about this community, which put their existence to spotlight.
 Question here is, are Bani people Shia Muslims or just Banis? And what kind of religion Bani is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: My experience in Vietnam is a treasure on my heart. 
 (Rant)I spent time there a few years back. An American in your beautiful country. I think of the smells, the people, the beauty, and the food. Your kindness to me and my travel mate was second to none, from the south to the north. I know it may be required of your culture to be "nice" when you really want to say what needs to be said, but I saw a humble care of the world in which the Vietnamese live, which includes naive tourists. Always kind to me, which I am not used to.
 As an American, I am so thankful for your hospitality. From my perspective, I would have so much animosity towards people like me. Maybe you keep it to yourselves. Or maybe, you just want to move on. A humble strength in family and kindess. 
 Vietnam is one of my fondest memories. I treasure it. I spent a night on a boat in Ha Long Bay. Although I was drunk and silly, the crew invited me and my girlfriend to the kitchen. Vietnamese food and a strange, ridiculously strong sangria. One of the greatest experiences in my life. It was like 345 in the morning!
 I got to sleep in. And the crew, who I think several were celebrating birthdays, were up at like 5! Being hungover on a boat while working sounds impossible. They did it, cause they had to. Tourism is likely the (I don't know) biggest money makers for Vietnam these days I imagine.
 My last night, I got a tattoo on my inner left forearm in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh). I hear that many people tired of their tattoos when they see them everyday. For me? I wax nostalgic and think of how amazing Vietnam was. How it is. And how it treated me and my friend. 
 Not only do I have a great experience. But the people of Vietnam make me want to be a better person. I try everyday. Be humble. Be kind. Make good pho. Regrettably, the latter tastes like salty water. I'll keep trying.
 I miss Vietnam. Thank you.

 These are some of the things she did:
  
She spat and bit me after I didn’t want to wear formal clothes to my friend’s birthday party at age 8. She then clapped and laughed at me after poking holes on my pants with scissors. I cried so hard that day.
 
She cut my pajama pants for refusing to wear anything above the knees.
 
Told me “it was such a huge mistake giving birth to you”.
 
Pour food on head after refusing to eat( I was three at that time).
 
Beat my sister so hard she bled from her mouth when she was 4-5 y.o.
 
Kicked me in the back.
 
Called me “thang dong tinh”( similar to the f-slur) and splashed tea at me for reason number 2 (luckily the tea was cold at that time).
 
Screamed and calling me “thang cho”( a dog) for not bringing a ruler to school.
 
 This happened to me when I was 6-12 y.o. My sister told me my mother was abusive but I don’t think she was since I’ve seen some of my Vietnamese relatives’ parents who did stuffs way worse than my mom did.

I've considered moving back after getting a job offer but ultimately decided not to purely because it wouldn't further my career, at least not in the industry I'm in. Really did consider it though since I got lots of family there too
 That being said, I do have very mixed feelings of the current government. On one hand, they freed us from all our colonizers which is something I think all of us feel very proud of and it just feels liberating, you know, knowing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It probably hasnt been discussed on here much, but curious to see thoughts on the gender disparity.
 Vietnam has the 5th highest in the world , with 111.4 male births (currently) to every 100 females: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sex-ratio-at-birth?tab=table
 This has been a social trend in the country for 30-35 years, but it has accelerated dramatically over the past 10-20 years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Vietnam#/media/File%3AVietnam_population_pyramid_01.04.2019.png
 Any thoughts on this? I can imagine some pretty concerning social issues arising from this in future (if not already)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is not an appropriate place to post this, but I wasn’t sure what other subreddit to post this to.
 I met a Vietnamese guy on a tour last year in South America. We stayed in touch and when I went over to Thailand, we decided to meet up there. I’ve noticed that he is not that polite to hotel and restaurant staff as well as drivers. For example, he doesn’t say thank you when staff brings his drink or food to the table ever. He doesn’t say thank you when we are leaving the restaurant and they are saying thank you and goodbye. He’s not mean to them or anything, he simply ignores them. We hired a driver and instead of walking a few meters to meet the driver, he insisted the driver come into a very tight spot even though it was super inconvenient for the driver to have to back out. I tried to tell him we can just walk up to a more convenient spot and he said no, that we are paying the guy so we will wait for him to come to us.
 I’m wondering if this is just a cultural thing? I am ethnically Vietnamese, however I grew up in the US and my attitude is completely different (I’ve also worked in the hospitality industry so maybe I’m hypersensitive to this). I grew up being taught to be extra nice to hospitality workers because they work very hard but make very little. I get a sense from him that he sees them as beneath them. Is this a common attitude towards staff in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although there is some similarity to other neighboring countries, our culture as well as clothing still have clear differences. For example, Vietnamese smoke Thuốc Lào, eat Trầu, dye their teeth black, wear darker color outside and colorful inner Áo Mớ Ba Mớ Bảy, and hair keep hair loose. In clothing, we have many hats like Nón Quai Thao, Nón Đinh Tự, Toàn Hoa etc. Just like the chest wrap skirt in the video, we Vietnamese use it with a Round collar robe - Áo Viên Lĩnh inside with hair covering fabric; while others don't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I don't want to be disrespectful, but I have a sincere question. 
 I spent a night in a sleeping bus in a lower cabin and the guys from the company had no choice but to sleep on the ground between cabins. One guy spent the entire night spreading his legs right and left, and doing so, he was touching my bottom all night long. I could not sleep because it made me feel really inconfortable. I tried many times to push his legs, but he would do it again, and again and again. 
 I don't understand, because I thought it was very disrespectful to touch people of the opposite sex?
 Is it normal? How should I react if it happens again? Can I ask him to stop doing it or would he be angry? 
 Thank you for your answers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serious question here. Why do so many Vietnamese burn garbage? Outside of the traffic situation, burning of things and the resulting air pollution it causes is without a doubt the most negative aspect of this amazing country. I don’t get it as everything I have seen on fire could have easily been put on virtually any curb for pickup by the garbage crews at least in the cities where smoke impacts a lot of people. 
 It makes me so mad as it not only affects my health, but more so, that of babies and children who are more vulnerable plus ALL of you who live here. Why is this not something the government is cracking down on as the trickle down health effects surely are taking a toll on the nation...even just cognatively as it effects your brain too. Plus, who wants to constantly be getting whiffs of burning plastics and whatnot on the daily? It is 2023 and we KNOW better, so why the ignorance in this particular area here? 
 If you burn things on the regular basis…why? Can you please shed some light as to your motivations? 
 From Wikipedia:
 “The World Health Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.[6] Studies published in March 2019 indicated that the number may be around 8.8 million.[127] A 2022 review concluded that air pollution was responsible for 6.67 (5.90–7.49) million premature deaths in 2019. It concluded that since 2015 little real progress against (superordinate) pollution, which remained at ~9 million earlier deaths, can be identified.[128][19]00090-0-19) Causes of deaths include strokes, heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections.[6]"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone has some experience on what may be the best approach. For my last two days in Vietnam, I'm struggling to decide on two different scenarios. I'm not deterred by long days and aim to do as much as I can. I've heard Ha Long Bay is more touristy, so I'd like to avoid that if possible. But here are what I've found to be the best scenarios - so if there are other options that I am not thinking of, please share!
 Option One: Day trip excursion from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay. Lasts ~12 hours and allows me to book another one day excursion from Hanoi for the second day. I feel like this will result in roughly 6 hours total of travel back and forth for each day, so seems like I am not getting the most out of my days. But, may allow me to see something else I haven't considered for a day trip.
 Option Two: Depart early AM via train or bus to Cat Ba Island, arriving midday. This allows some brief exploration of Cat Ba National Park. However, the following day it is unclear to be me if I can actually see Lan Hay Bay. I will be leaving out of Hanoi at 2300hrs that night, so need to be back to the airport around 2000hrs. It looks like my options to get back to mainland are to ferry at 1530hrs (ending my day prematurely) or at 1730hrs (getting back too late). Would it even be possible for me to see Lan Ha Bay in this time? The only thing I've found only is departing from 0800 and not arriving back to the island until 1500, which means my only option would be to take the ferry back at 1730. I'd like to make this option work, if I can, to see the mostt of the island but looks like the timing doesn't quite work :(
 ​
 Thanks!

 Edit: no, not switching my trip to Boulogne. Ignore the movie set dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow travelers! I recently arrived in North Vietnam and I've been on the hunt for off-beat places to explore. While Hanoi was amazing, I couldn't wait to get out of the city and immerse myself in the beautiful nature of this country.
 But my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I arrived at Ha Long Bay. The pictures I saw online were nothing like the reality I experienced. It was crowded with tourists and heavily commercialized. I needed to find a hidden gem!
 That's why I'm turning to you, fellow travelers, for help. Do you know of any hidden spots in North Vietnam that are off the beaten path? Maybe a secret waterfall, a secluded beach, or a quaint village with friendly locals?
 I'm on the hunt for something unique and authentic. Something that's not overrun with tourists and where I can truly experience the beauty of Vietnam. So, if you have any recommendations, please share them in the comments below!
 Let's help each other escape the tourist trap and discover the hidden treasures of North Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I wanted to kindly ask for any advice and recommendations regarding possible job opportunities in the tourism/hotel sector of Da Nang/Hoi An. I am 32 years old, originally from Germany. I have BA degree in Southeast Asian and American Studies. I am considering to do a second degree in Tourism/Hotel-Management at an online university in order to be able to work while studying. 
 My overall CV has a lot of "holes" in it, because in my 20s I spent quit a fair amount of time traveling around the globe. I worked seven years as a freelance journalists with a main emphasis on tourism; had countless jobs in restaurants; worked for a company specialized in book trade; and, more recently, been employed as a social worker at a school in Germany. I also have my own little side hustle going on, selling records/cds/cassettes. In addition, I speak Indonesian and Malay, and I am currently trying to advance my Vietnamese language skills. 
 In the near and distant future, I'd like to live and work in Da Nang. I spent a fair amount of time in the city in the recent decade, and I feel very much at home there. My girlfriend lives in Da Nang, too, and we are in committed long term relationship. Therefore, I am considering to find a suitable occupation for myself in the city, and I can picture myself doing a good job in the tourism sector. Online, though, I can barely find any job ads. 
 I'd be very grateful if anyone could give me some honest feedback if I'd be able to get a work permit in the tourism sector in Da Nang with my background; and if so, I'd appreciate any tips on what to keep in mind, what to be careful about, and so forth. 
 Thank you so much in advance! =)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apparently I'm providing technical support as a volunteer for a ceremony in my University (NEU Career Week) and i'm tasked with making Powerpoint slides, lighting, etc.There will be parts where music is needed such as giving prizes, awards, introduction of sponsors (yes, money is involved).
 I was going to use video game themes for them, some are actually from Nintendo. But upon reading about copyrights, i thought it'd be much safer top use something different.
 My question is if I use a popular song in the ceremony, will there be accusations of copyright infringement? I'd like apologize if I asked something dumb, but I'm a 2nd year student, still got a lot to learn, and this is my first time doing such important thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[👋 Hi Please don't laugh at me but my partner sent me 2 packs of Viet pancake mix and a bottle of fish sauce. I'm so rubbish at cooking but trying to learn and I'm not doing to bad. I just need a simple recipe for the pancakes. I have bacon and shrimp and spring onions for the pancakes.
 The fish sauce dip I have nooooo clue what it's supposed to taste like. I've never tasted fish sauce before. I have lemon 🍋 sugar and the fish sauce. I don't have any chili flakes as I'm making it for my 8 year old daughter too (also I'm a stereotypical English WF who can't handle too much heat! Wahhh ) So any simple step by step for the dip please 🙏 My partner is coming over to visit and I want to impress him.

Obviously nothing too elaborate but a nice token as a friendly cultural exchange. I'm looking for ideas of something easy to pack. Thanks in advance.

We have tracked down family of four female, male and two babies all foraging and playing. They seem to have a lot of fun amongst each other, especially the babies. About 30 minutes of watching them they have decided to leave the tree and go further. Male Gibbon went directly above us and let it rip, the poop showered us, my camera, clothes, and my girlfriends clothes. Anyone got similar experience with Gibbons? Our guide told us this never happened on his treks, so I'm just wondering. Amazing experience anyway, would get pooped on by a wild Gibbon any day. 10/10.

 I've been meaning to discuss a pressing issue that has been on my mind for quite some time now – the uncontrolled building development in Vietnam, particularly the excessive construction of high-rise apartments. It seems that the rapid urbanization and economic growth in recent years have led to a boom in real estate development, but sadly, this has come with a slew of negative consequences.
 To start with, the infrastructure in cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City is severely lacking and has not kept pace with the construction of these massive apartment complexes. The result? Incredibly congested streets, inadequate public transportation systems, and a general decrease in the quality of life for the residents.

 Sorry if this seems off-topic but my friend has reached top 10 in the vietnamese league server as well as Challenger in both EUW and NA. I think she has a shot at Saigon Buffalo or another pro vietnamese team but besides emailing them what are some ways she could get her foot in the door?
 I'd ask in the leagueoflegends website but most of them are North American players so I don't think there'd be any vietnamese players. I also think its much harder to break in the vietnamese pro circuit than it is in other regions.
 Any advice appreciated. I can provide her accounts if need be.

 They sweettalk and use different tropes to push their goods. There is a part of conversation between my wife and one of the sellers in Vincom plaza
 Seller (foreigner): You know today is my bday, so if you buy cream name I will give you another cream for free.
 Shop assistant (VNese) Oh, wow, boss, really? That’s such a good deal!
 They were pretty polite and nice at the start, but completely lost us at this birthday script. The VNese shop assistant’s reaction was so fake, it’s funny.
 Have you personally met such people and what do you know about it?

 After receiving an emergency passport, would we have any issues trying to fly to Hanoi so we can transfer and get to Tokyo on our flight?

Lmao? Not to mention all the Chinese movies and shows that were sponsored and sanctioned by the State and their money, are all over the Vietnamese TVs. 
 Those that know will boycott the movie, the average people dont know shit and will watch it. And watching it doesnt mean you support Donnie Yen’s view … and since the economy is going through a recession, the movie industry is dwindling, the International Court of Arbitration denied the 9 dash line’s legitimacy… why not show it, scrapping some billions VND while at it. 
 Sorry for the rant.

 I'm considering a study exchange in Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City. The exchange would last about 6 months. I estimate I would need roughly 6 packets of Medikinet (active substance is Methylphenidate). Is that too much too risk for? Is it generally legal to bring that stuff in - in such amounts - every packet has 30 tablets (25mg per each tablet)? What procedures would and should I go through? And finally, what kind of documents - and how prepared - should I bring with me?
 Thx for the answers. 
 PS: I don't think I wanna risk with a bribe haha

Where can we go that would order an MRI that we could get in a timely fashion. I work in medicine and we have and we have exhausted pharmacy options. I know he needs an MRI, so I am specifically looking for a clinic/facility where he could be evaluated and get referred for a n MRI. Thank you.

Im finally going back after many years but Im worried I might not be immune to some things or my vaccinations are not up to date. Is there any shots I should absolutely get before visiting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! The title kinda speaks for itself. I'm in Vietnam at the moment and whilst here I was hoping to find some factory seconds from brands that I would normally find back home in Australia. Specifically, Vivobarefoot (a barefoot shoe brand), Patagonia, Arcteryx, North Face, etc. I'm in the north near Hanoi but I'm happy to travel!
 Any information or sharing of contacts would be appreciated. I'm not looking to resell, and I'm mostly needing the gear for trekking. The shoe brand for instance, they are one of the only brands that manafactures in my size (US15), so if I could stock up whilst here that would be helpful. Thanks all.

 I have the address from my parents and this is what is on each line. I guess this is how my parents have always addressed it when they send something, but I'm not sure if it's properly formatted. Their family lives in a rural area. Thank you!

I'm going to make an effort to buy good gifts, and they are not cheap. My question is: is the first meeting more important or more special than the next ones? I mean, if I give them better gifts on the first meeting than on the second meeting, will it be strange? Or will they expect the gifts to become better and better? I'm very confused. Could someone help? Thank you!

 I am afraid about giving a better (and more expensive) gift for grandpa than dad and it becomes an unpleasant situation. What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance!

Omg they were pushing in line sandwiching everyone, talking and screaming so loud. The men would smoke when there is a no smoking sign. For Buddhas sake you’re at a temple. 
 Then at Tac coc at Bai Dinh temple, signs are everywhere to be silent or quiet as possible. But these ladies are yelling screaming from a distance. Like can’t you read or have some respect?
 Ok done ranting. Maybe it’s the norm for them. But kinda rub me the wrong way.

 It was a harrowing welcome to Vietnam, let's just say that!
 I've been chased by a couple aggressive dogs since that, and seen some wild looking dogs just roaming the streets that I don't want anything to do with. 
 I refuse to pet or put myself in any sort of vulnerable position even with friendly dogs. 
 I grew up with pet dogs in the west. To say I'm a dog lover is an understatement. I miss my family's dog so much while I'm here. 
 I never would have thought that I would develop a fear of dogs, but I feel it growing every time I have to walk past an unknown dog on the street. 
 Rabies scares me more than the dogs to be honest... 
 Luckily the family dog didn't have rabies and is still alive. But 5 shots is really annoying to schedule around. Pretty cool they are only $2 though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Went to get a massage here in Hanoi. Massage was 300k and after the massage I assumed 50k would be enough for a tip. But the masseuse refused and so I pulled out a 100k note and she took it and then pointed at the 50k to give to her as well. I don't speak any vietnamese so I just gave it to her as well. Was I ripped off? 50% tip is a little too much imo 😅 I just considered it foreigner tax and won't be going back to that place lol
 Edit: This thread has been polarizing. And for the record it was just a normal 90 minute massage. No extras. And if I'm being honest the massage was not good either. The lady was inconsistent on where to apply pressure and did not do so equally on both sides and just massaged wherever. The place was nice and situated in a somewhat affluent neighborhood so I expected something better.

I just bought a set of cards that I had seen a group of Vietnamese women play a few days ago, and wanted to learn the rules but I can’t find anything convincing on internet (the rules found in Wikipedia don’t make much sense). Anyone has a link to the rules of Tam cúc (which is, I think, the game they were playing, as they had these thin Chinese cards)?
 Thanks a bunch! Will keep on looking online in case I find anything.
 Extra question: anyone knows where to import to Europe the cool plastic or wooden stools found at the street food stalls/bars?
 Edit: If someone knows the rules, could I send a DM with my doubts on the rules found online?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I ask because I've seen quite a few articles about how extremely easily-offended many Vietnamese immigrant communities, especially in Seattle and throughout California and Texas, are when they see the modern flag, equating it with the Confederate and Nazi flags, and have forced many institutions to use the traditional yellow one instead.
 I kinda wonder if it's as serious as local news outlets say it is or if it's all gross exaggerations that inadvertently make the Vietnamese community look bad. Because taken to the logical extreme, it would mean Hardee's/Carl's Jr and Steven Universe would be protested against or banned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically, renting a bike and riding from HCMC to Hanoi later this year.
 Planning to rent either a Honda Blade or Honda XR150. The dates I will be travelling are from 24th Oct to the the 4th of November. 
 So I have currently planned 10 days of riding.
 Day 1: HCMC to Cat Tien Day 2: Cat Tien to Dalat Day 3: Dalat to Phan Thiet Day 4: Phan Thiet to Nha Trang Day 5: Nha Trang to Mang den Day 6: Mang Den to Hoi an Day 7: Hoi an to Hue Day 8: Hue to Phong Nha Day 9: Phong Nha to Mai chau Day 10: Mai Chau to Hanoi
 Now here is my dilemma. I am very time restricted and only have 12 full days to complete this ride. Is it possible to do this? Am I an idiot for even considering this? Will I make it in time considering weather etc? I am a very experienced rider, so riding in the rain does not bother me, but will floods and such stop me? Any recommendations or considerations would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I hope you're all doing well. 
 I am used to solo traveling, and sometimes I schedule solo trips for my birthday to celebrate it on a different way. Every time I did this I had an amazing time with the people I met randomly during the trips! 
 This year I've chosen to do this in Vietnam and I was thinking on spending this day on a 2-days cruise to Ha Long Bay. My other options are Hanoi itself or maybe Da Nang. I am, however, scared that these cruises are full of closed groups or families and I end up having a not-so-pleasant experience. 
 For those who did this already, what do you think? Is there any other alternative you strongly suggest? Side note: turning 33. 
 Many thanks!

 This made me wonder why buses should be used at all. Maybe just personal preference to be in bigger, safer vehicles? Why do you guys use them?

I am traveling with my friend who speaks the language but I’ll be having some down time to go out and explore a bit. I’ll be in Nha Trang, Da Nang, and Saigon. I enjoy live music, sight-seeing, coffee, bars, of course food! Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do and how i can meet locals? Or even other travelers? I’m not a super extroverted person so this is uncharted territories for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm visiting Vietnam in April but having huge issues booking hotels via booking.com. Both of the hotels I have booked so far want me to either transfer them via Square/Paypal or give them my card details over Whatsapp.
 Does this seem like a scam? 
 They already have my card details, so I don't understand why they can't charge me the deposit immediately.

Ha long bay is something we're planning to do, but the itineraries seem the same between companies and we came up with the idea of maybe just going to Ha Long and spending the night there to book a day cruise from town. 
 Is this a good or bad idea? We're trying to budget and a lot the 2 day tours are higher than what we're hoping for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to Vietnam for 2 weeks in May, I’m just looking for some ideas on how to fill my time being there. 
 My basic itinerary is the following
 Flying into Hanoi and going straight to Halong bay for 3 days Going back to Hanoi for 3 days Flying to Ho Chi Minh for 3 days Flying to Da Nang for 3 days 
 I’m going with my partner but she’s there for work for the first few days in Halong and we’re meeting in Hanoi 3 days later. 
 Just looking for some ideas on the solo 3 days in Halong for a somewhat adventurous guy, I plan on doing a day cruise and a Hike but don’t know how to fill the other couple days there. 
 I enjoy architecture and scenery I plan to enjoy in Hanoi, but any must sees would be amazing to hear. 
 The Ho Chi Minh trip I plan on doing the walking street and unsure how to fill the other days. 
 Da Nang I plan on doing the hands bridge and enjoying the beach I think doing the marble mountain as well and doing a trip to Hà Nội as well. 
 Any input, on how to fill the days is greatly appreciated!

He went to highschool here, speaks the language, goes to university and soon will be eligible for a citizenship here. To get it, he needs to renounce the Vietnamese citizenship but he told me that it can be a very long and difficult process. Does anyone have experience with it? Is it really that difficult?
 Another thing - he has not done the military training and is not planning to as he wants to spend his life in Latvia. But he has to go to Vietnam this summer to renew his ID. I'm worried he might get into trouble for avoiding the training so I'm quite worried about him going there. Can anyone give me some insight on this?

 Of course 2 weeks are not enough to see all those beautiful spots/things, but I have a very detailed itinerary I prepared myself and I already know I will want to come back 😍
 The advice I would love to receive from you is what can I buy there that is way cheaper than in Europe. I am only thinking to buy stuff for myself, but it is not that clear to me if there are really all these opportunities like it seems reading online. 
 Appreciate any tips

 Relaxing its visa policy and extending visa-free stay for eligible countries.
 Developing new products and services that cater to the diverse needs and preferences of travelers.
 Promoting its natural beauty, cultural heritage and gastronomy as unique selling points.
 Leveraging its strong economic ties with neighboring countries and potential markets.
 What is your thought?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some advice from vietnamese families/women or anyone who has done this before in a vietnamese context. 
 I'm the only expat in my community and I'd really love to start a mom's group to get to know the others in the community better. I know the concept is probably not normal for Vietnam but would anyone have any suggestions on what sort of things would be a "draw" for a mom's group? I know how the groups are in my home country but my husband says if I just say "a time to share together, talk together, and learn from each other" no one will come (I kind of agree). I also don't want it to seem like a kid drop-off time if I say we will do things like have storytime and snacks. 
 What in your opinion would be some activities that would make a monthly group/meet-up for vietnamese moms exciting and worthwhile? 
 (For context, the group will be in vietnamese, and not in a large city setting)

 I am buying some gifts for my girlfriend's family and one of the gifts (alcohol) has a snake symbol in it. I bought it but then I kept wondering if that may have some bad meaning in vietnam. If that's the case, I will not give this gift. 
 Anyone? Thank you!

 Are there any shops in Hanoi selling old (used) comics, books and magazines?
 When i'm abroad i'm always looking for comic books in the native language, especially Donald Duck (Donald và bạn hữ) but also the franco-belgian stuff like Tintin, Lucky Luke and Asterix. It seems all this series were published in Vietnam at least two decades ago but not any longer. I guess Mangas are the big thing now.
 A couple of years ago (2017?) in HCMC i stumbled across a street (can't remember which district) with shop on shop where old magazines were pieled up in front. I found a lot of stuff but it was just the first week of our trip and my wife would've killed me if we had to carry a ton of comics for a month...
 Are there any of these shops in Hanoi. I've been to Đinh Lễ Street and Nhà sách Mão already (these pop up when you google). But all i got was one new Tintin at Trang Tien bookstore. A lot of shops i found on Google Maps which seemed very promissing are actually closed (Covid i guess).
 Thanks!

 We're visiting Vietnam for the first time, and after seeing HCMC, Hanoi, Ha Long, and Da Nang/Hoi An we're considering for location to work one week remotely before heading home - thus, where would you stay and why (at end of April)?
 My initial consideration is:
 a) to avoid HCMC and Hanoi and due to hecticness
 b) to avoid Nha Trang due to the potentially high amount of russian tourists/ex-pats
 c) to highly consider staying in Da Nang/Hoi An and renting a villa
 Thank you in advance for your opinions! Much appreciated!

I live near a Vietnamese Catholic church and I was always curious to observe a Catholic mass. Would I be judged for visiting a Vietnamese Catholic church on a random Sunday? As a Vietnamese person I notice that older Vietnamese individuals can be judgemental/gossip and as someone who usually wears head coverings to church out of respect and religious focus, I don't want to stick out too much.

Their English is too bad that they even think the word trash-talking is swearing, and I were calling they are trash - I have no word. Kept trash talking about me because of the language barrier, I understand 100% what they said. However, they didn't listen and always thought that I did something wrong to them, then spread the misunderstanding to their friends... Became really toxic, killed me in spawn because they have a gang,...
 If you are the member in that gang, please. Stop making the image of a friendly country turning into a toxic place where every one of my friends always warn me to stay away from them online (even Vietnamese friends advised me it)
 I also wonder if it is the majority of your community is like that, or I'm just unlucky?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So apparently, Vietnam has signed an agreement to recognize driver's licenses from other ASEAN countries. I've read from a a few sources that Vietnam does indeed recognize them in certain situations (but not others?). The sources don't bother mentioning in which specific situations they're recognized though. I'm planning to do the Ha Giang loop next week and heard they're checking for checking for licenses quite frequently nowadays. Has anyone showed their Filipino, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian or Singaporean license to the cops and gotten away with it? (Or any other ASEAN country, just got lazy to list them all)

 Are there any long term programs that facilitate long-term visas ( Education Visa/Student Visa) that are not higher learning degrees (bachelor's ECT)?
 What are the approximate prices and costs for such programs?

Ofc it’s not as popular as the Yankees, Red Sox and D*dgers but I understand that MLB is more of a fashion brand and I’m sure most people who wear the brand probably don’t care about baseball at all but it just hits close to home seeing people rocking with it. Would be even better to get more people interested in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife is from Vietnam but has been living in the US for 8 years. Her parents have been living here longer, and no longer have any Vietnamese citizenship papers. The question concerns them.
 Due to circumstances they put their properties in the name of a relative who still lives in Vietnam, but now they wish to change that. Because they no longer have their citizenship papers, and it takes a long time to get them again, they cannot put the properties in their names. What sort of options do they have?
 I was wondering if there was a kind of trust they could use to own the property, but have the trust be controlled by them, or, at the very least, have it be controlled by a relative still in Vietnam, but with their name attached in some way that requires their consent for anything to be done to the property. They are old and probably too trusting, I want to see if there is any way we can help protect their interests as well as possible. They said they already spoke to an attorney, but I am not sure they spoke to the right kind or asked the right questions.
 Any help is appreciated.

 Should I meet him and then apply for the k1 visa??? I wonder if they would even let me apply since I barely meet him for the first time. I am just so confused about what I should do. I know I need to provide so many documents and proof. I'm in southern California if anyone knows any companies for assistance :(

Mình đang ở canada theo diện work permit nên sẽ có 3 năm để làm việc và cũng như cơ hội để kiếm thẻ xanh ở đây. Nhưng mà hiện tại thì em cảm thấy rất muốn về VN để sinh sống và làm việc cũng như được ở gần gia đình và bạn bè hơn. Nên mình dự tính là vẫn sẽ ở canada làm việc 2-3 năm để có thêm kinh nghiệm (và bằng CPA ). Mình chỉ đang thắc mắc là nếu trường hợp mình như vậy thì về vn có ổn không ạ? Và vấn đề lương thì mọi người thấy như thế nào? Mình thật sự rất cần lời khuyên ngay lúc này vì mình cảm thấy rất nhớ Việt Nam. Nếu quyết định về VN thì mình nghĩ lương sẽ không thể nào bằng được như ở CA được, nhưng mình nghĩ mình sẽ thoải mái hơn vì được gần gia đình và bạn bè và cũng như được ăn những món mình thích hoặc buồn thì cứ xách xe lên mà đi 1 vòng thôi. Nhưng nếu lương không ổn thì cũng hơi stress 1 tí. 
 Cho mình cảm ơn mọi người nhiều.
 Hi everyone. I have just graduated from the university majoring in accounting and currently working as an accountant in Big4. I am in Canada on a work permit so I will have 3 years to work as well as the opportunity to apply for a green card. But now, I really feel like going back to Vietnam to live and work so I can be closer to my family and friends. I’m planning to stay in Canada to work for 2-3 years to gain more experience (and getting CPA). Is ok to go back to Vietnam after that? And what about the salary expectation? I really need some advices right now because I miss Vietnam so much. If I do decide to return to Vietnam, I don't think the salary will be as good as compared to CA, but I think I will be happier since I can be closer family and friends .
 Thank you and I really appreciate any advices/ suggestions/ inputs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm currently in Southeast Asia and will be arriving in Vietnam in late April. I originally planned to do the motorbike loop in Ha Giang independently on rented bikes, but that was before I learned about needing a motorcycle license. I don't want to risk my insurance being void, so that's out of the question now. 
 I was pretty set on doing it independently without a company, so this threw a real wrench in my plan. I've already decided to skip travelling to Northern Thailand because of burning season, so I know I'll be back to the area, so my question is whether I should wait until I have a motorcycle license and do it later in life, or just suck it up and do it with an easy rider. 
 The reason I'm posting is just to hear how it went for other people. I don't love not being in control of my own bike, I'm somewhat introverted so the social aspect isn't huge, I like being able to stop and check out little shops or side roads, and I'm concerned with a bigger group that I won't be able to do this. I don't really have the money to do a private tour, and even doing it with an easy rider is putting a bit of a stretch on my budget. 
 Overall though, I'm wondering if I should still just do it. I suppose I'm just looking for stories of how people felt using easy riders and whether they felt like they would have had a better time doing it solo. The loop was the one thing I wanted to do the most out of Southeast Asia, but I'm wondering if I should just do it later when I can fully enjoy it. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Looking for some advice - let me know if this isn’t the right place. Friend and I are planning to ride 110cc bikes from north to south, weaving from mountains to coast in April/May. 
 We are fully licensed to ride motorcycles in the US and have been riding for years. Fully understand that riding there is different and we take that seriously. Would be wearing protective gear and staying off the roads that don’t allow bikes. The US IDP provided by AAA lists Vietnam as “not party to the 1949 convention but honors IDP”. This is a little confusing as Vietnam did sign the Geneva convention in 1953. So while we aren’t terribly worried about being allowed to do this, we are having trouble finding medical insurance coverage since there doesn’t appear to be any laws that explicitly say US citizens can rent or drive any type or vehicle there. We’ve read about certain companies that would provide medical coverage anyway as long as you are licensed and qualified in your home country but haven’t found one yet.
 Is anyone aware of a way we can do this? Or any companies that expats or travelers have used successfully recently? I’m not willing to ride without medical coverage so I would need to travel by other means or go somewhere else. This is a trip I’ve been thinking of doing for years - I’d be extremely bummed to have to see this beautiful country out a train window and not be able to experience the smaller mountain communities along the journey (I’d also need to do the trip alone in this case). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spent 9 days traveling in Vietnam. Started from Hoi An and kept moving to Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, and ended at Ho Chi Minh. Used different modes of transport, met tons of people, and experienced things that I'm truly grateful for.
 My experiences helped me break a lot of stereotypes and prejudices that were told to me before my visit. Vietnam is not a country for cheap shopping or fake stuff or weird food. it's not a country where people will con you or misguide you. It's not a country that is rude, indifferent, or selfish.
 After 9 days in Vietnam, I'm taking back memories of meeting kind locals who go out of their way to help you, friendly shopkeepers who give you a small sovenieur as good luck because you made them smile while bargaining, helpful grab drivers who gave you a genuine smile just because you bowed and offered with money with both hands, Bar tenders and staff, who booked grab for me and offered a free drink just because i was nice to them. At every situation I got stuck or lost, I was given direction by locals who didn't have to give a fuck about me. After traveling many places in the world, I sincerely believe that if tourists remove their stereotypical blindfolds, they can experience a truly beautiful country I.e. Vietnam. ❤️ And that's what I'm taking back to India with me.
 P.S: I would like to offer my hospitality if anyone is planning to travel to India, especially Mumbai. Over and out.

 I know that generally STEM is better than Social subjects, however if you guys would apply to a university in VietNam, which one would you consider? I would like to study Law or Business and I already know some basic Vietnamese as i had experience with the language before and studying it for university wouldn't be a problem! 
 Please help me as I am considering VietNam as one of my destionations for pursuing a higher education, Xin Cam On! ;)

 Where do you buy contact lenses and contact fluid? I'm in Bin Thanh at the moment but any place that speaks english will do. I don't need a check up, just the lenses. I head out tomorrow and hoping to pick up lenses quickly. Looking for a place like Top Charoen Optical in Thailand. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: trying to find an old family graveyard. I know it’s hopeless, but maybe someone here has some advice lol
 My grandmother’s grandmother is from Huế, my grandmother’s family is from Tra Vinh, where we went to a family graveyard when we went to Vietnam for the first time this summer. We were able to come there since our family still has contact with Hmong people (?) that used to work for the family who own it now. It had the graves of many family members except one, my grandmother’s grandmother: Nguyễn Thị Điệm (born ca. 1880). Although there was a picture of her with her date of death: 20 Aug 1916. My grandmother told me that she was buried in Huế with her family, and that her brother who now lives in the US visited the grave in 2000 via contact with the gravekeepers, although she has not had contact with him for a long time, and does not seem very keen on doing it either. Apparently her brother (my greatuncle) is also not that bright due to his years in the camp.
 The family was apparently very rich, and were according to my family close to the emperor, I know nothing else except that Nguyễn Thị Điệm’s brother was a very prestigious or conceited photographer.
 I know its probably hopeless, but does anyone maybe have any advice on how i should find (how to contact) the graveyard (owners)? Or any other advice?
 Or just drop your personal family stories in the comments:)

 How does it work typically? I work for an MNC and while I do not want to go into the zone of corruption, I do want to understand the dynamics between seller/customers. 
 Do people typically go KTVs for some 'fun' or is it usually in normal dinner places or what not? Are gifts expected?

 So I'm actually a half Filipino half Vietnamese(dad filipino, mom vietnamese), when I was 7 years old, my mom was ask to go back to Vietnam since she's been overstayed here in the Philippines, and promised to comeback after she fix the issue, and in the first few months we still have a communication with her and then suddenly gone, no calls, letter, etc.
 I am now 24 years old, Ive been searching for her for years, I do not wish her to come back to our lives, I just wanted to know how was she's been doing. I tried searching her on facebook but no luck, cuz everytime I searched her full name a lot of the accounts has the same or similar names, I even include my middle name which is "Nguyen" in my facebook so its easier for her to find me.
 And I'm not even sure if this is right sub to post this, and sorry if my writing is scuffed, and also my english😅😅

 Would really like to know what the word actually was, hopefully he wasn't calling me a dickhead! Haha

 All the providers I've seen (including reputable ones like TrueTraveller or World Nomads) say it on their fine print that they only cover medical treatment in state-run hospitals.
 I am looking for a provider that would foot the bill from a private hospital.
 Does anyone know of any providers?

 I plan to travel to Da Nang via Ho Chi Minh City. The plane ticket that I am looking at has 1 hour 50 minutes layover in HCMC Airport. The airport's domestic terminal doesn't seem so far away from the international terminal. But being a foreigner, I need to go though the customs and immigrations, which I heard could take approximately an hour.
 Would I have enough time to catch the connecting flight to Da Nang or should I get another ticket that has a 3 hour layover?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am Vietnamese girl dating an expat for the 1st time, plz give me some advices. I live in Hanoi, he lives in HCM so this is the first time dating. He asks me to show him around when we meet in Hanoi. I was kinda passive in the relationships with other Vietnamese boyfriends before, like they picked me up to dating locations. Thus, I don’t know how to take the lead in dating with an expat in Hanoi. Which type of transportation used when we date? I don’t have car driving license. Pick him up by a motorbike I drive is bit weird, isn’t it? Have you been in this situation? Plz share your experience. Kindly introduce me some places that expats want to hangout in Hanoi. We are both in twenties. Much appreciated!
 Edit: Thank so much for your advice. Most of them are very helpful. I am way too overthinking. I was worried about the size difference if I drive him on a bike, im like 5’1 feet while he is 6’2 feet. But, I will ask him what he wants to choose bike or cab although bike is the my most preferred transport when hanging out in Hanoi. To whom who may wish me luck with green card: he is not even a Western. He is my Hindu colleague. We hit it off and accept a long distance relationship. That’s it. Now Vietnamese girls don’t date expats for money. We can be both cute and rich at the same time. Get used to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am visiting Vietnam in July this year for a close friend's wedding. Just wondering what Vietnamese people typically give their friends and loved ones as a wedding gift? I've actually never been to any wedding as an adult so I'm a bit lost and gifting in a completely different culture makes it feel even more daunting. I would love to hear some examples of what you would typically choose as a wedding gift.
 Also - Other foreign friends who are going have said they are just going to give the couple money, is this normal/acceptable in Vietnam? And if so, how much should one typically give?
 Appreciate any insights, cheers

 I'm very interested in the Vietnam war and already know plenty about it, so visiting something like this seem like a natural choice but at the same time I hate things that are too touristy and this seem exactly that. People posing for dumb pictures, like thousands of others before them, standing on destroyed tanks or in entrances to one of the tunnels.
 Would you recommend it?

 I was wondering - is this casual for that side of the country or is it because of the burning season, similarly to Northern Thailand?
 Maybe anyone currently travelling there could share there experiences?

 I'm in Da Nang for the next 7 weeks and love it so far. But still did not meet any local women, which I obviously wouldn't mind. I would like to go out tomorrow night, I don't mind going solo. And then, I am usually not afraid to talk with a women if there seems to be an ''opening''. I value a good friendship, and nice communication / talk, even if nothings happens afterwards. It's really mostly about meeting local people/women and ''why not if more''.
 What would be the best nightclubs to easily meet local people who are more likely to be ''into foreigners'' (I am in my thirties, very healthy and tall, I think I can be doing ok) and more likely to be able to talk a bit or good English ? Avoiding places full of ''pro's'' and full of Koreans could be a good thing I imagine :D (but I imagine it's not always avoidable).
 Thanks in advance !

 Mình ở đâu đấy?
 Lạc vào trong xứ sở dâu tây
 Phía đằng xa,
 Giữa bãi cỏ hai người nằm ra
 Chú cuội ngủ cùng chị Hằng Nga
 Nick Vujicic dùng đầu đập cửa
 Gọi cô bé cầm nhầm bật lửa
 Bác xuân diệu vô cùng vội vàng
 Gọi cô tấm đi dự hội làng
 Bảy cô lùn đi cùng ông tuyết
 nếu bị lạc liên hệ tổng đài 1900-00-không-biết
 anh thánh gióng miệng nhiều vết bẩn
 ăn bánh quy, kẹo chip chip, sữa chua nếp cẩm
 aladin gạ gẫm mỵ nương bàn kế hoạch hóa
 sơn tinh ném bàn ghế gạch đá
 scooby dooby doo lại phải dắt sơn tinh đi tù
 giơ khẩu súng nặn bằng đất sét
 cả ngôi làng đều chạy mất dép
 scooby dooby doo lại phải dắt sơn tinh đi tù
 thủy tinh mang theo cốc trà chanh
 làng vắng tanh như chùa bà đanh
 ran mori sử dụng tán thủ
 các võ sư không ai dám thử
 nên nàng đưa conan về nhà cả hai phá án ở nhà thám tử
 một giấc mơ suýt thì hoàn chỉnh
 có giọng nói làm mình choàng tỉnh
 xanh, đỏ, tím, vàng 
 any help is appreciated, sorry for possibly sounding stupid.

 ​
 We are going to Vietnam for 2 weeks late March with my wife (28 and 25 year old): 5 days in HCM, 3days in Phu Quoc and 5days in Hanoï.
 ​
 In Hanoï we are thinking going there:
  
Hanoi Train Streets
 Ha Long Bay : do you recommend 2days/1night or 3days/2nights?
 Vietnam Military History Museum
 Hoàn Kiếm Lake
 Don Xuan market
 French quarter
  
​
 HCM:
  
Ben Thanh market
 An Dong market
 War remnants Museum
 Vincom Center
 Nam Cat Tien park
 Nguyen Hue walk
 Mekong Delta
  
​
 Do you have any recommendations or advices? 
 Also, I am a bit clueless on the best transportation to go to Ha Long Bay or Mekong Delta. In the city, I planned to use Grab or Go-jek.
 ​
 Thanks in advance :)

I live in Europe and I’m not sure how mobile networks work outside European Union. I’m looking for a good few GBs of data 20-30GB allowance with a few national calls for hostels and local calls. Do Vietnamese providers offer roaming in neighbouring countries like you’d get in Europe? What are the prices like and what are my options? All help appreciated.
 I actually work for a big provider in my home country where it’s unlimited national data + 19GB anywhere in the EU for €20 . I’d love to find something similar if possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years ago I was constantly seeing stories about how Vietnam had the highest economic growth in Southeast Asia. Was getting massively invested in by Japan and Korea, and had tons of companies relocating to it from China during the Sino-American trade war. Many YouTubers I was watch on the ground said they could see the explosive growth year by year as it felt like the early days of China as it was beginning to achieve great economic success. The everyday life was becoming tangibly better year by year.
 But I checked in again recently, and I saw the GDP growth has massively faltered the past two years, and also saw that the previous economics minded president has seemingly been replaced by a more politics minded one.
 So I was just wondering, does Vietnam still seem to be on track for explosive growth and this is just a short break because of COVID or is the growth really slowing down? Is life still improving year by year in Vietnam to a noticable degree?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am on Phu Quoc right now and I see it again. Huuuuge luxury hotels, but nearly completely empty. When I look the price up its 5M Dong a night. 5M Dong. 
 How do these luxury hotels even survive? Why they don’t lower the price?
 It seems like the hotel owners are so crazy rich they don’t care about some losses and don’t want to lower the prices to not lose image or something. (imagine you pay $200 for a hotel and some months later it’s $100 a night because of low demand. in Europe or also in Thailand, hotels dgaf and just lower the price to get at least some customers, but here it’s not like that). Or?? I can’t understand it pls explain me guys
 Also this Vin Grand World has sooo many restaurants and stuff with expensive food, but most of them are completely empty because it’s too expensive when you could get outside the same food for much lower price. 
 It seems like the “market” with demand offer etc doesn’t really work for these giants they just dgaf about losses, or is there some bigger story behind that? I also remember how people in this sub once talked how expensive vinfast cars became or smth like that

 I'm wondering if a large number of people in Vietnam want to immigrate to other countries(specifically the West) or if this is government propaganda in the West trying to put down other countries to make themselves look better by comparison. 
 Thanks for your help in advance!

 Have you stayed in a hotel in the Old Quarter recently?
 I visited Hanoi in 2018, 2019 and again in 2022. The hotels had changed a lot in 3 years as many had been affected by Covid and the flood damage. While no doubt it's down to the unfortunate circumstances, the last couple of places I stayed in 2022 were nothing like the photos/reviews, were damaged and run down.
 Bringing the family along in 2023 and would like to know your recommendations for a nice place to stay.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I visited Hanoi for a few weeks and went to some clubs too. In most clubs the sold balloons and I was told they contain laughing gas. Saw some people getting really high on it and kinda knocked out sometimes.
 Friend handed me (already very drunk) one and I tried it several times excessively but had no reaction.
 First, I don't know if laughing gas is illegal. Some clubs were really suspicious and you had to talk to some guy around a corner to get through some secret gate. Somehow you couldn't here any of the loud music outside.
 And second could we get scammed? Is selling fake gas a thing? I'm not a fan and won't do it ever again, but I'm really interested in understanding what happened there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone, Yeah it's another Vietnam itinerary.
 I'm traveling with my wife from India to spend around 2 weeks in this country on our anniversary. Need help in making an itinerary that has a balance of both a little fast and relaxed overall.
 But I'm too confused to jot down the itinerary completely, mainly in the number of days to spend in a city. Some parts are fixed though.
 Fixed (15 days): 14th April '23 to 28th April '23,
 Flights Booked and stay booked for Phu Quoc
 14th arrival (Ho Chi Minh) Going to Phu Quoc directly
 14th to 16th (Phu Quoc)
 28th departure (Hanoi)
 I want to cover the country from south to central to the north, with the 19th being preferred not traveling as it's our anniversary that day.
 Uncertain (16th to 28th):
 No Stay or Travel option booked
 16th to 18th: Ho Chi Minh Stay
 18th to 19th: Nha Trang, can this be skipped? as it'll make us travel on the 19th to Hoi An/Da nang
 19th to 21st: Hoi An, Da nang, and Ba Na Hills (Unable to select dates to stay where on which date, maximizing things to do in each place)
 22nd to 28th: Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Sa pa
 We want to cover Ninh Binh and Phong Nha National Park as well but that doesn't seem to be possible as this above draft itself feels a little rushed. We are already removed Dalat and Hue from our itinerary for the same reason, doesn't want it to be too fast-paced.
 Now I want help with what place we can omit if this itinerary looks too rushed or not possible.
 Any other suggestion for a newbie in Vietnam please do suggest!

 Has anyone ever heard of a store in Saigon called Kallos? It’s located in D10 and they have items I want to get for myself and others, however I cannot find anyone (so far) who has either heard of them or shopped there. 
 They’re an outlet (similar to Vincom) and have excellent professional reviews and items, nice FB page, reviews and it’s run by a Korean man who opened up his own shop. But it would be very reassuring to know if someone has actually shopped here before. 
 If either anyone here, or you have someone who has shopped here before, please let me know and the most important let me know if the products you bought were authentic or fake because this is what I’m worried about more than anything. I attach an image of the address and business as well. Kallos Vietnam

 I have a driver's license in Germany for cars only and I have a Vietnamese passport but my residence is in Germany.
 I would like to bring an international Driver's license back to Vietnam to ride a motorbike legally. I know I just need to do a practical test.
 My question is: will my licence have a short expiry date like foreigners who stay in Vietnam for a limited time? Or will the license expiration date be the same as my driver's licence in Germany because I have Vietnamese citizenship? I have no residence in Vietnam.
 My plan is to use the license again for multiple visits. It will take time for the license to be issued, so I can't afford the time to get the license every time I visit Vietnam.
 (Yes, I know I can drive illegally and bribe officers, but I want my health and liability insurance to pay for higher damages if I ever get into a serious accident)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ll be spending two weeks across Vietnam in March and would like to visit places where I can learn about the history of your country. I understand that there are plenty of museums in Hanoi and Saigon, but I’m curious to hear about other historically significant locations that can be visited and learned from as a tourist. 
 Large graves, temples, war zones, etc.. are of interest, if possible.

I really want to go back at some point and I’m curious as to how much Hanoi has changed. Some things I remember:
 Roads were like 90% motorcycles, 7% cars, and 3% bikes
 Sông tô lịch was literally just an open sewer (please tell me this has gotten better lmao)
 No one wore seatbelts, and while I was there when people began being required to wear helmets, a lot of people wouldn’t buckle them
 Cutting in line was very common 
 Crosswalks weren’t a thing, you just walked across the street and people swerved around you
 Has any of this changed?

 Era was recommended by my hotel but I had low expectations. I'm happy to say that the food and service were magnificent. 
 Duan and his wife are foodies and it shows in the taste and presentation of the good eats they serve at their restaurant. After a short chat I learned that Duan is self-taught cook and that he and his wife love to experiment with recipes. His methodology puts me in mind of a food scientist. 
 I left very full. Very happy. And, very satisfied. I finally had a meal that was worth all the hype.

 I was on a tour with another company when I realized the return time to Halong Bay City would make me late for a transfer to Hanoi. I was assured at booking that there would not be a conflict but that was not the case. 
 I saw Thao's boat departing (a completely different company) and asked if I could hitch a ride back to the city with them. Both the captain and Thao, the tour guide, agreed to let me come along. 
 But, it gets better. Thao called my hotel so I could grant permission for the transfer driver to pick-up my luggage. 
 He also called the transport company to arrange an alternate pick-up location and changed my pick up time. Then Thao had one of his wait staff to rush me to the new pick-up location on the back of her scooter. Thanks to them I made it to Hanoi and now sit comfortably in my hotel room. 
 Thao refused a tip and I paid a nominal fee to the captain and the waitress/motorbike driver. In fact, the waitress returned half of the very small fee I paid her and refused when I insisted she keep all of it. 
 I'm so grateful to Thao and the staff for helping a complete stranger. They truly went above and beyond earning them the LifeSaver award. Many thanks to them all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love living in Vietnam 🇻🇳 ❤️ but the thing that kills me is the unnecessarily LOUD TRUCK HORNS. My ears hurt and it startles me (sometimes to the point of crashing) every time one of them decides to blare their cargo ship horn near me. I get alerts on my Apple Watch all the time about how the noise level could cause hearing loss. Oh and the way they drive is insane too! This happens all the time: a big ol 🚛 barreling down the road in the lane traveling the opposite direction from me ENTERS INTO MY LANE, and almost literally RUNS ME OFF THE ROAD. Keep in mind, as a guy driving a motorbike, I’m already in the habit of riding on the very edge of the road, but in the interest of safety, I’ve had to go off the road so many times because some impatient cargo truck driver can’t stand to behind another car so they invade a lane of oncoming traffic whenever they feel like it.
 Back to the horn problem…it has caused numerous deaths. It’s so loud that it had caused people to be startled to the point of falling off their motorbike and getting hit by the semi trucks or getting into deadly accidents with other vehicles from loss of control. It happens too much, and although there is technically a law against it but the penalty (like 2-3tr vnđ) is so light compared to the damage it causes.

 I bought them from a store in China, it costs about 365 dollars. The store decided to deliver my package by Fedex (Air way).
 It was shipped quickly from HongKong to Ho Chi Minh for about 3 days, but then it got stuck at a clearance process for over a week. Now I have no clue what I need to do next since Fedex Vietnam keeps asking me to wait.
 For those having the same experiences, is that your typical durations for an import custom process to Vietnam? This is a first time I buy a product from foreign countries so I am little shock.

 Iced milk coffee
 According to the culinary website Taste Atlas, Vietnam's iced coffee ranks second among the top 10 best coffees in the world.
 Taste Atlas describes, Vietnamese iced coffee is a combination of dark black coffee with condensed milk and ice.
 Traditionally, iced milk coffee must be made from medium or coarsely ground Vietnamese coffee, typically Robusta.
 The way to make Vietnamese coffee is also unique, unlike anywhere else in the world when pouring hot water through a small filter to let each drop of concentrated coffee flow into the cup, then it will be mixed with condensed milk and added ice.
 Please enjoy once if you have the opportunity to visit Vietnam.

Even though he only half understood us, we were pretty sure he meant we have 4gb per day for 30days. (is this Even a possible price?) After 5 days the internet stopped working. I had internet again the next day and got a message in the evening the 1gb/day was used up. You get but on dozens of other messages that tell something about tariffs but translated only make half sense. Can I ignore them? (I know this from South America where you were often spammed with fake stuff). And do you know which messages you can take seriously?
 Also, how does the charging work? I have seen that there is a short code *101#. In general, I am a bit clueless and would need someone to explain the whole thing to me. Thanks in advance!

 Quick question again, basically I have very specific hair needs since I have nice, natural curly hair. There is a specific moisture cream that makes my curls extremely luxurious that I really cannot do without now. Because otherwise my hair will be very dry and frizzy and coarse. 
 My question, would my package either be seized or held up with customs when shipping the product? Mind you, I will not be shipping any electronics or perishables (food) or anything like this ever, I would only ever need to order skin/hair care from South Korea to Vietnam. The shop I order from is KoreaDepart, they ship everywhere, however my question is not with them it’s about can I get the products into Vietnam without being seized or held up and having to pay out the ass in fees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see posts a lot where it is usually a foreigner marrying a girl from VN. However, does anyone have experience with marrying a man from VN as a foreigner?
 I'm not really a foreigner either, I'm a VK but don't speak vietnamese at all, but I do speak a chinese dialect and was able to get around a little in VN when I was there for 1 month. During that time, I met someone that is too perfect. We aren't dating, just friends, we met accidently. His family runs a little food shop/stand and I couldn't speak Vietnamese so he stepped in to help and we just started talking since I was there during slow business time.
 Prior to that I also thought about moving to VN to stay closer to family. I also like VN but I feel like I am romanticizing it too much and the reason I like it is because I can escape from my problems (work burnout).
 ​
 I don't really know what I really want to ask. I just want to hear from people about their experience. Since men and women in VN can be different in a relationship because of culture. I don't want to start a relationship and get his hopes up since he is older than me with aging parents.

 Does anyone know how to get your social security insurance contributions or a law firm that could help? 
 I am moving back to the states and was told by my HR Rep that the government can only give me a plaque/certificate with the years worked, not MONEY
 I am owed a decent amount of money and the government has refused to pay, I heard this was also a problem in china but know of friends getting their money there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember being very interested in Vietnam's Tay Son period ever since I was as young as 7, and I remember always feeling extremely unwell hearing about all these Tay Son bloodlines and everything, including famous generals like Bùi Thị Xuân and her daughter getting stomped to death by elephants. Or the ensuing executions of Nguyễn Nhạc's children by having them sawed in half. Despite it being years later, I still feel sad reading about the infamous Nguyen Lord and later Gia Long's rampage against Quang Trung's monarch. But then It is also my responsibility to be aware that part of his bloodlust was also due to the fact that he had witnessed the killings against his own family when the Tay Son swept down South.
 Humans are scary.
 If anyone else has any insight or corrections which I know will be inevitably pointed out, I would totally love to hear them and see what else I needed to learn about this event.

 I don’t eat pork or shellfish , and would prefer not to eat any other meat such as chicken or beef. 
 How easy will it be to find options that are ‘chay’ when I am out exploring? How easy will it be to avoid fish sauce, which I know contains shrimp, for example? 
 Is there anything I could buy in a supermarket that is vegetarian that I could quickly grab and go, if I’m in a hurry ?
 Many thanks! 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking into getting a loan in Vietnam as a foreigner for a property purchase. 
 Did not have much luck with banks. Most do not offer loans for foreigners, or people living outside of HN or SG. Vietnam Russia Bank (VRB) seemed to be the easiest for foreigners. 
 I then found Homebase and it seemed too perfect. But the more I read about them in both English and Vietnamese media, the more they seem legit. Though it's hard to find much reviews from customers that aren't their own promotional material.
 Does anyone know of any experiences with them? Interested hearing both Vietnamese and foreigner experiences.
 If not familiar, they work like: they initially buy the property and own it, then you buy it back from them at a pre-agreed upon price (at any time). You're allowed use the property while buying back.

I was directed to the office but a guy stepped up yo me and offered to get me a pcr test to let me fly for $200. In a panic, i agreed and he did some stuff and got me the test, but the gate was closed. So basically i had to buy a flight ticket to Osaka for a little bit later ($455) because i was told i couldn’t get any refund or transfer for the ticket i had + my visa for Vietnam was over today. I then had to pay the guy 4 mil for the pcr and sprinted to make my flight. In addition, new flight from Osaka Just ran into another guy in Osaka who was at the airport and he said the fake pcr was not only 150 but i could have just paid 1 mil to have my ticket changed until i could get a real pcr test for cheap. I feel like an idiot although i know i was just panicked and wanted nothing more than to make it to Tokyo so I’m out $700 extra dollars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I have been reading about the Doi Moi policy, which the Communist Party or Vietnam (CPV) implemented in 1986. 
 A lot of articles and videos I found on the Internet tend to praise the policy for transforming Vietnam into a rising economy in the ASEAN region, surpassing my country (the Philippines) and others in terms of economic growth and development. 
 I even watched a video from Bloomberg about how North Korea once planned of adopting Vietnam-style reforms to open and grow its economy before the COVID-19 pandemic.
 So I want to know what this sub thinks of Doi Moi. Should other developing countries like the Philippines and North Korea follow Vietnam's example? Was it effective in bringing prosperity to Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m curious, has anyone ever been to “Tuyết Thành” - outside of Saigon? What’s it like? How hard is it to get to from Saigon?
 “Tuyết Thành, or "Snowy Citadel" in English, is a city located just 35 kilometers outside of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite being situated in a tropical region, Tuyết Thành is renowned for its year-round snowfall, which is a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for years.”
 “The snow in Tuyết Thành is a stunning sight to behold, falling softly from the sky to create a winter wonderland that is both surreal and magical. The snow is powdery and light, making it perfect for building snowmen or engaging in snowball fights. The cause of this phenomenon remains a mystery, but locals speculate that it's due to a unique combination of climatic and geographic factors. Nonetheless, Tuyết Thành is a popular destination for tourists seeking an extraordinary winter experience in Vietnam.”

I'm moving into a house for the first time and have to get my own internet. I've noticed that my banking app has options to pay for Internet and the options are FPT and Viettel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I recently made a post about shipping an open-box ps4 to my cuz in HCMC using an independent Viet shipper here, and it got held up at customs. That’s what the shipper told me anyway. 
 I’ve decided to ship her a brand new console in the box and everything. What shipping should I use to ensure that she’ll get it? I have UPS, FedEx, DHL, regular postal service. 
 Any tips on filling out customs paperwork and stuff to make sure it gets through? 
 If you’re wondering why I’m not giving her the money to just buy one, I got this ps5 as a gift for free so I can’t justify shelling out $500-600.
 Edit: extra words

 Anyone into it? Im new to it however i have some cash to blow on a good setup.
 Anyone buy locally or suggest any good shops? Id rather not piece ship it internationally and if i dont have to rather not buy when i head to US and put it on the plane. 
 I debated steams full setup and a new PC to run it. I am really going to focus on a realistic driver setup(minus the moving hydrolic chair stuff) and flight simulator to learn how to fly.
 Hanoi is ok to but prefer Saigon.
 Open to people commenting on setups also if they have experience since im a noob to it all

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to order a few unique accessories for a VR headset from abroad, and I've never in my life used websites like amazon/ubuy/etc. 
 I'm not familiar with shipping to Vietnam and wanted to get some insights here from the people who have experience with this.
 Which service would you recommend (Amazon, etc.)? Would it be 100% reliable? What obstacles might exist there? And is it as easy as simply ordering on the website and waiting for delivery, or would I need to personally contact customs to pay any extra fees? 
 I live in Central Vietnam so it would not be possible for me to go to Hanoi or HCMC to deal with customs.

 I came to the US in 2005 with a passport that was issued in 2003 (expired in 2008). I am currently a permanent resident. My boss is asking me if I want to go overseas for a couple months for business trips in April. However, I do not know if I can even renew my original passport or can I just get a new one? I am near DC so I can just drive there for passport service instead of mailing documents in.

I was really set on Hanoi, but from what I have been reading it is apparently not a very walkable city. Here in the US, I do not own a car and very rarely drive. I have taken public transportation my whole life and really prefer that to owning/paying for a car.
 I am a bit freaked out by the idea of renting a scooter given how hectic the roads are, but I will do it if that's what it takes to come live in Vietnam. But I was wanting to ask how feasible is it to walk and use public transport in Hanoi, or if there is a better city that is suited for this that is not HCMC? What about places outside major cities?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im new to Reddit so not sure how to post text with pictures. After posting this incidents in some FB groups, people shared their similar experiences so it happens quite a lot. I have never thought someone dares to steal in this area where there are so many security cameras
 Summary: - Before going through security screening, I took off my watch, put it in my purse. My purse didn't have zipper or lock. Put my purse lying down next to my husband's bag, in the same tray. (XRAY MACHINE IMAGE confirmed there was watch in my purse) - My husband push the bag tray in Xray machine then went through body scan. Then another man jumped in while I was taking off my shoes. I let him since I didn't want to delay other people - I went through body scan after pushing the shoe tray in Xray - Right after that, I got my purse back from my husband at the conveyor belt. I STOOD RIGHT THERE AND SEARCHED FOR THE WATCH, it was gone. I walked a little further (about 10 steps) to avoid blocking the way and took all stuff out of my purse to search for it. Nothing - 1 minute later (YES WE HAVE CAMERA FOOTAGE), my husband went back to the conveyor belt area to check all the trays around. Found nothing - I reported the issue to the airport security team. No official report, no help from them. Later I had to fly back to Phu Quoc to make a scene and got official report and watched camera footage and Xray machine images.

 If you know good spots up in Hanoi too, that’d be cool. Willing to take any local recommendations for any dish as well. I understand that best can be difficult to define and tends to be subjective, so whatever you tell me I’ll look into.
 Thanks!

 So I'm here living with my wife and I'm trying to learn the language. Things are going quite well as far as reading and writing and speaking. But understanding what people say to me is really not going well. 
 We live in the far south, near Long Xuyên. 
 There's one sound in particular that is killing my brain, and that is the words beginning with "ch".
 All references I can find for learning the language indicate that words like chào like in xin chào are pronounced the same way we would in English, like chow, choice, chomp etc.
 Down here in the south people pronounce it with more of a g sound as in growl, gouge, graph. My wife says this is not true, but to my ear that's what it sounds like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Im currently in negotiations to work with a well established startup in vn.
 They have already received 2 rounds of funding for 12 million USD and have yearly sales of almost 50 million. They are doing well and employing around 75 people, including native engineers and many skilled factory workers. 
 After this month of brutal internet, the series B round funders have issued an ultimatum for them to move design out of vietnam immediately. This was very embarrassing after a month of video call after video call was dropped; we were having a terrible time accessing code repositories hosted out of country, and a bunch of other problems due to new products relying on cloud connectivity. 
 the investors are foreign, frankly they have little faith in whats going on here. They seem to believe its not just a coincidence of all the internet cables but one breaking down; but rather a systematic problem, either in infrastructure, or govt mismanagement. They visited earlier this month, met with city officials in ho chi minh, and were appalled at the attitude, as well as conditions around the city, and believe growth in a high tech field will only be impeded by being here. 
 Frankly i cant argue. I love what we are working on and hate to have to turn away from this myself, but while they can work hard and compete, they will always be be hamstrung by access to real talent, and the 2nd world infrastructure. There is a culture of inefficiency in vn thinking that fester these kinds of problems. But founder is a rare brilliant vietnamese engineer who came home to make something good here, and looks like they wont be able to stay. 
 Come on vn, get your shit together.

Also I was the only one in the store, it was early morning. What are your feelings on this, would you consider it rude or disrespectful? I wouldn't try this if they were busy, or if I knew the person was born here, I just like the feedback and maybe it would make them feel more welcomed and make them remember their home country?
 I'm not sure, have at me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning to travel to Vietnam, from India for 8-9 days with my parents in mid April. We are mostly looking for mountains or a place with pleasant weather in April. I have narrowed down to below places, but my parents can not trek, due to bad knees. Also we dont want it to be a hectic trip and want some time to enjoy a place as well. Can you please suggest me the places I can skip ? Vietnam : 1. Hanoi 2. Sapa 3. Ninh binh 4. Halong bay 5. Cat ba island 6. Mai chau 7. Pu luong 8. Moc chau 9. Ha giang
 Also, country other than Vietnam is also welcome(except Europe,since we can travel for 9 days only) .

 Hello there I’m not Vietnamese but I stumble upon a video on Facebook about a case of a pet salon where the workers unprofessionalism ended up in a dog’s death, by doing my research I found the original video on YouTube it’s called chewy hung to death at a pet spa by Brent Strydom (I really recommend not watching the video as it was incredibly graphic and horrible to see what happens to the dog) the user called Brent strydom seems to have been the owner of chewy and was claiming justice for what happened, it was uploaded on 2017 so idk if it got resolved or not since comments are deactivated and he didn’t left any social media on his channel to contact him so if anyone may know something about this case please let me know

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know it's partly because of the CSGT not enforcing traffic laws, but in Australia and I assume other places at least 2/3 of the reason people follow traffic rules is because the public will publicly shame you if you don't and if you're unlucky someone will punch your face in. But it seems even the good drivers in Vietnam just roll over and accept it when someone tries to murder them on the roads.

The shipper says it’s in the warehouse at the airport pending some customs issues. They didn’t explain a lot. I shipped electronics before with no problems. Should I just assume that it’s lost at this point? The shipper said to wait 2-3 weeks. It’s coming up on 3 weeks and they’re not returning my calls. 
 Anyone encountered this issue? Are there specific products that warrant more scrutiny?

However, our trip might have to be pushed back a few weeks, and I’m worried about the start of the rainy season interfering with good driving/riding conditions. My partner and I both have decent experience on motorbikes, but we haven’t decided if we want to do the EasyRider option or drive ourselves. Any input on weather considerations for the overall experience would be amazing!

 We are four friends who are planning a trip to Southeast Asia between December 2023 and January 2024. As we begin to plan our itinerary, we are hoping to find a relaxing spot where we can unwind and swim towards the end of our trip.
 We've heard so much about the natural beauty of your countries and we would love to experience it firsthand. As described in the post on r/laos linked below, we would like to do a wild experience in the first weeks. We are hoping to find a beach or lake where we can enjoy some peace and quiet at the end of our travel. We are also hoping to find a spot with some amenities nearby, like restaurants or shops, but we don't want anything too crowded or touristy.
 We would really appreciate any recommendations you might have for a relaxing spot where we can swim and unwind during our trip. We are open to any and all suggestions, so please feel free to share your favorite spots and hidden gems with us.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

 I'm hopping on a plane
 Leaving right away
 My heart's set on a different name
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 My flip-flops and my shorts
 Are waiting at the door
 To explore every hidden nook
 Of Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's never been too clean
 Where the traffic's like a symphony
 And the street food's obscene
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's got its own soundtrack
 With motorbikes and horns and shouting
 And sunsets that take my breath
 ​
 Verse 2:
 I'm ready to escape
 This monotonous place
 And see how life's done in the East
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 From Pho to Banh Mi
 And everything in between
 The food here is so divine
 In Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 Where coffee's a religion
 And there's so much life on every street
 That I feel pure elation
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That never seems to sleep
 Where locals bike and tourists gawk
 And the air's a little too thick
 ​
 Bridge:
 If I can make it here
 I'll make it anywhere
 It's up to you
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's got its own kind of magic
 With history that's felt at every turn
 And energy that's so classic
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's got its own style and flair
 With markets that hustle and bustle
 And a pulse that's beyond compare
 ​
 Outro:
 Saigon, Saigon
 I wanna wake up in a city that screams my name
 Saigon, Saigon
 Where the hustle and bustle is always insane.

 First of all the staff are excellent. Friendly and helpful check in agent and driver. 
 Have no issue whatsoever with the customer service. For that this vendor earns three stars. 
 Areas of improvement:
 VIP bus was messy. Had water bottles and trash from previous guests. Mini van was a little worn. Not as pristine as the photos but not terrible either. 
 Where Cuc Tung looses stars is the driving experience. It was terrifying. The driver took unnecessary risks. There was low visibility due to fog and rain. Other travelers pulled off unto the side of the road but our driver's speed barely slowed down around the twists and turns of the mountain two lane highway And, he regularly passed cars while in blind curves. It was three a* clenching hours I was thankful to have survived. 
 Safety should be a higher priority than timeliness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone know if it is real jade being sold at the tip of Ngu Hanh Son (Marble Mountain) in Da Nang? Where are they sourced?
 I went to most stalls in the area, even the small street vendors and they all claim that the jade they sell is real. I am just curious about the authenticity because their jade were selling for only a fraction of what it would cost in gold stores. For example, some ranged between 50k - 1 mill. Also, what is the deal with the price difference? I assume some may be either fake or real. If anyone is familiar with the area, some advice on where to find an authentic dealer is highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few questions about the housing market in HCMC. I’m really just asking out of curiosity since I can’t actually purchase a SFR in Vietnam. Reading about Seoul’s fucked-up housing situation kind of freaks me out so I’m kind of curious about what’s happening in HCMC. 
 My aunt “recently” sold their childhood house in D3 of HCMC for ~$500K USD. This is just what I overheard so I could honestly be mistaken, but this seems like a crazy amount for someone in VN to purchase considering the average annual salary of someone in HCMC. The only thing that stands out about this house to me is that it’s unlike the standard tall, narrow row houses with 4+ floors and had two floors, was much “wider” than it was tall, and had a backyard. It was a little out of place relative to the other structures around it. 
 Is this “standard” pricing throughout most of HCMC? Sorry, I know this is a particularly stupid question since HCMC is massive. 
 Do most people in HCMC “dream” about purchasing single family residences or has the goal shifted to purchasing a nice condo? Another family member told me that you can reasonably expect a newer condo to go for about ~$80K USD which still seems disproportionately high for the average salary, but I don’t know. 
 Who is still able to purchase a “house” or a “condo”? 
 Would you say the majority of people in HCMC today were born and raised there or moved there in the last 20 or so years?

 I have a Samsung Galaxy A52 Android phone running on Viettel. I'm planning to travel to the US and I want to us my phone with one of the carriers there. I checked T-Mobile and my phone's technology and band appear to be compatible. But I don't know if my phone is unlocked, or how to unlock it.
 I bought it in Danang from one of the big electronic stores. There are three A52 models. Mine is the regular A52 that does not support 5G. Model SM-A525F/DS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends- a friend and I have both realized we have some recollection of a cover of "The Rain" by Orange Juice Jones in Vietnamese existing, and that it was not a freak fever dream from our childhood.
 We are desperate to find it because it is exactly what you would expect from similar covers. (Thai Tai's "Never Gonna Give You Up" cover is peak 90s cheesy and unexpected.) I am actively combing through my playlists and discography to find it, and am wondering if the song goes by a different title in Vietnamese.
 I recall it was Trung Hanh or someone similar who sang it, but I cannot accurately recall.
 Thanks in advance,
 Keru

 Many shops tape up your bag with sticky tape when you buy something.
 Some shops staple your receipt to the bag.
 etc.
  
My question is not why such practices exist (presumably all are somehow intended to minimize theft) and what they might indicate about society---that has been discussed here before.
 Instead, my question is where and how they originated. Can anybody shed light on where, how and when these practices became widespread in VN---and how they spread to become ubiquitous across the country?
 (Obviously these practices are not all unique to VN; that's irrelevant.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm long-term renting a house here in VN and like most other houses there is a large-ish altar built in to a wall (complete with switched yellow lights) and another altar above the kitchen hearth. 
 I'm not Vietnamese and so the concept of ancestor veneration is totally foreign to me, but I appreciate that it's a part of the culture here. In my own house though, I really don't care. So the kitchen alter is currently holding spices, and the main home alter is bare (I was thinking it'd be good for books and knickknacks).
 My question: Am I going to offend someone or put them off if they visit my house? Am I exposing myself to some supernatural peril? I've previously lived in places with a mezuzah and Mary in a clamshell and don't see how this is different, but my landlady is nice and if using an alter as a spice rack is disrespectful I don't want to rock the boat.

 As I understand however, Thuy Nga has been struggling to expand it's audience base. The younger generation especially in the US is not as tied into the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War so those older songs ( aren't that appealing ). DVD sales are useless now. And the " Young " Singers that Thuy Nga has; well for one thing, they're not that good at singing, and they're not " Young ". One of Thuy Nga's " Young " Singers, Diem Suong is 33 years old. And Nhu Loan is 41. 
 Enter Myra Tran. She was not recruited by Thuy Nga. But rather, came to them through American Idol. She's now ( so far at least ) doing pretty well in Vietnam, while having some success in the US with Paris By Night.
 ​
 What do you guys think ? Can Thuy Nga adapt to new audience through Myra Tran ?

I'm only concerned about the car having a level 2 automated driving system ( I get used to in my country before) or full speed acc. My Vietnamese wife told me when the car was imported to Vietnam, they will cut off this function. But I believe some brands probably can find it.
 Can you recommend a car brand or model that has this system? Thank you a lot!
