 Are there other platforms (that operate/are based in Vietnam) that take international-based credit cards? I'm open to opening a bank account with international banks like HSBC if that helps. As mentioned in the title, I also have CCND and can open a Vietnamese-based bank account, but I'm not too sure how the process works.

 I'm thinking about taking the ~12 days guided motorcycle trip to Hanoi then flying back, that sounds simply amazing. But good alternatives would be spending some more time in the city and taking my time in the south instead. I love a good hike or some local culture and would hate to rush things.
 What would be your thoughts on how best to spend the time?

 I'm (33) Australian my wife (30) is Vietnamese lived here since 18 years old. We've been married for 6.5 years together for 10. 
 I've been to Vietnam many times and I love it, when we touch down in Saigon I start getting an almost 'coming home' vibe. My Viet language skills are actually not too bad, so I can get around by myself, order my own food, shopping, basic conversation. 
 Anyway, my in laws are coming here for a visit, it's winter so doing some of the really great Australian outdoor type activities, so we are gonna take them out for dinners, some shows etc. We have planned for a weekend away in a cottage in the countryside with some of my family. Now my in laws speak next to zero english, and my family speak no Viet. 
 I'm just wondering if anyone might have some suggestions for some good activities we could enjoy together without having to rely to heavily on my wife to translate constantly. Like some games or activities or board games etc. We can do while enjoying a couple of beers by the fireplace. Hopefully someone out there has some suggestions, I just want them to feel like they're participating with us rather than just observers.
 Thanks ☺️

 1) Go through customs, Exit international terminal. Look for the green umbrella tents across the street. 100 yards max. cant miss them. 5-6 large green umbrellas. I dont ever remember seeing these before. 
 2) open grab and use the green umbrella area as your pick up spot.
 it should cost you 125k dong to get into D1. Grab will add 15k for the airport toll. Total bill should be about 140k + any surge. The driver pays the toll.
 Waiting for grab at 6am = 10 mins
 ride to D1 took 15-20 mins.
 Cost was 140k dong which is like 7 bux. and best was ZERO stress of being ripped. had 3-4 taxi guys approach and follow me to grab area.

 I was wanting to fly somewhere fun and interesting this winter for vacation and I was interested in visiting Vietnam for it's connection to Cold War history even after the Vietnam War.
 However, when looking at tickets for Vietnam through Expedia, I noticed that they aren't the cheapest.
 Being a college student on a budget, I was kind of curious if anyone here has a preferred airline they fly with when it comes to Vietnam whether it is to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City?
 Thanks in advance everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foodie friend asked me to help ask around...
 La Maison 1888 is the French fine dining restaurant of Intercontinental Hotel Da Nang. This hotel is a 30 minute car ride away from the main beach because it is on the far end of the coast, and it does not allow Grab pickups out of the hotel. The restaurant is built into an old villa on a cliff, overlooking the water, and is very beautiful. They emphasize that they have the only 3 Michelin star French chef working there, and claim to be the #1 food destination in Vietnam. (Tasting menu is VND4-5M.)
 The advertising feels scammy because there is no such thing as a Michelin star chef. They claim the chef helped design the menu and he runs a 3 Michelin star restaurant in Paris, which is not the same thing and he is not in the Da Nang restaurant. Vietnam will only get Michelin rated retaurants in 2023, and only in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. There are very few blog reviews about the restaurant, and their TripAdvisor and Google Maps reviews do not imply that this is a legendary must try before you die place.
 Can Vietnam foodies comment?

 Not just for drinking but I was wondering about brushing my teeth with tap water, using ice cubes in drinks, etc.

Most of them are tourist attractions and we’re afraid they’re gonna be overcrowded. Does anyone have recommendations on bars, restaurants or some interesting spots, some kind of hidden gems, places that’s not too popular, or some fun activities we should try there? We also plan to rent a bike there to move from Da Nang to Hoi An, if anyone has some tips we would really appreciate it! Thank you!!

 For the most part I am able to drive normally on the road but I find it so hard park in small narrow parking spaces, sometimes there are security men help me sometimes there are not, and in those times when there is no one to help, I have fallen 3 times due to sudden brake when the gas was still on (the place so narrow I was afraid I’m gonna hit objects so I hit brake too sudden) And now I am starting to feel a bit fearful of driving :(

 First of all I spent 6 weeks in Vietnam and absolutely loved it the people are emazing, countryside beautiful as well as amazing food. I would love to revisit and go to the parts I didn't have time to see. 
 Im posting on here because I'm looking for a friend I met on a night out in Hanoi on the 4th May called Patrick who is Swedish. I'm female from the UK, we had a great time when we met but we didn't get chance to exchange any contact details. I think he's still in Vietnam in HCMC, I'm now not. If you're on here hit me up, it would be nice to see what you are up to. Absolute long shot and very unlikely they are on here (I probably won't ever find him.) 
 (I'm not sure if this is allowed on here and I will delete if not. Before I get any hate I understand that there are hundreds and thousands of tourists in Vietnam. Just thought I'd see if I could reconnect)

 I asked some Vietnamese friends and one mentioned the pronunciation of "calendar and lavender" and the use of "ish" (ie 'the party starts at ten-ish'). I'm looking for more examples.

 Me: Born in late 1980s
 We immigrated to the USA in the mid 1990s and all became US citizens over the next 10-20 years. I'm trying to resolve a USA pension related issue for my parents and it has been a nightmare because they didn't keep copies of the forms that I need. Pretty much the only significant documentation I've gotten from them is my refugee card and my Certificate of Citizenship.
 I'm tried pretty much everything I can think of to prove their marriage status but unfortunately:
 1) They never owned property
 2) They don't have a copy of their last joint tax filing (which would be 2015 or 2016). I'm currently trying to track down where they filed their taxes to see if I can get a copy, I also plan to contact the IRS.
 3) Social Security doesn't have them listed as each other's spouses even though they did provide me with a form that said my dad would translate for his wife, which is my mom (WHAT THE FUCK)

 They've said I can do my internship whenever I want, so I can decide when I travel. I don't know if it's best to travel in June 12-30 and then do my internship, or in July (after my internship)..or if there will be any difference at all 
 was hoping I'd be able to hike in sa pa and phong nha. I know it's rainy season,, but I am not sure if this means absolutely no hiking or nature ever, or if it'll just vary day by day ?
 :) I'm excited to live in HCMC
 I'm super keen to spend some time in jungles too--i wanted to do this tour, https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-ba-deep-jungle-expedition/ but it's 2 grand ... Any tips ? If I find a tent and someone cool to come with me, ? 
 Would really appreciate Any advice/comments you have, and if you have any special places to recommend id be very very grateful :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something about malls/supermarkets in Vietnam that makes me feel like it's more interesting and luxurious. In the US they just feel mainstream and "I go there just to buy stuff" kind of feeling. In Vietnam going to a supermarket is like being on a fun trip. For example a trip to Coop Mart was a lot more fascinating than walking around in Walmart. Maybe because I was young and poor so memories were more fond?
 ** Ok so I'm probably wrong about the malls. But what about the supermarkets? Is it fair to compare Walmart, Target and Costco to Coop Mart and Lotte Mart?

 This was my first time ever leaving the USA and to be honest, I didn’t know too much about Vietnam before taking the trip. I was really just looking forward to leaving the USA and experiencing a new spot on the globe, and the opportunity to go to VN just landed in my lap. I have to say, I was blown away by your country.

Listening to the audio, while writing down everything really helps for my learning and it's well paced. I recommend pimsleur for any viet kieus that never got around to learning vietnamese.

I know that China and Vietnam use to be on bad terms (might still be?) yet VietChinese people are so prevalent.

 Curious what the experience is like in Vietnam during Tết? To me it probably would be something cool and new since I never got to see it before.. but to my family over there they probably experienced it too many times already.

 Landed in Hanoi a few days ago and went for a full body Vietnamese massage at a parlor where the women were dressed up in everyday clothing. So I thought this massage was gonna be like in Thailand, and solely for muscle relaxation and recovery from walking.
 I turn on my back and massage was good, then all of a sudden I start to notice the lady spending a lot of time in my groin region. I thought i may have felt really tight there, so maybe she was working out some knots..
 I was wrong, I was getting aroused, and she knew as well. Then tells me she'll give me a good massage and motions for a "special" type of massage..
 There was NO intentions of me getting one, and I thought I was just getting a regular massage as I always have in Thailand.
 Anyone else have this happen?? It was pretty funny looking back at it, and still no "special massages" since being in Asia.

Basically, my girlfriend is Vietnamese and at the moment we are in a different country right now (different from my home country as well). What would be some sweet things that I can do for her, I mean in terms connected to Vietnam? Basically something thoughtful that would make her to remember about her country. Thank you so much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Viet boyfriend and I (South Korean girl) have dated for a year. We’re at the same age (2000 kids). We studied abroad at the same uni in Canada. Last year, my parents came to Canada to attend my convocation. I introduced him to my parents, and they're really impressed with him bc of his family background, handsome face, height, education and graduation job (these things are very important in Korean culture), 
 Next month, he and I will travel to Vietnam for summer vacation and visit his parents in Hanoi. I wanna make them impressed just like he did on my mom and dad. 
 What can I do to impress his parents?Especially when I come to his family house, and we do not speak the same language. 
 Do old Viet people judge girls by their look, family background like Korean do? I’m quite confident but I don’t look like Viet girls.
 My Viet female friend say Hanoi parents are extremely conservative. Is that true?
 What gifts should I give to them? I have some high-end korean skincare products for his mom, but have no idea for his dad.
 Update: thank you guys for great suggestions. As I know from my Viet female friend, his parents are well off and live in a big mansion in Hanoi. That could mean they’re open minded like you guys commented. I’m confident in answering all questions regarding family background, I know rich Asian people care about these things. My dad also asked him about his dad’s job when we had dinner in Toronto. My boy has a brother who has a wife working as IELTS teacher. Both of them can speak English, so luckily I have more people to talk without translation and support me. So excited to come to 🇻🇳🇻🇳 for the first time

I am fine with fish, lobster, crab, and shrimp. I'm not deathly allergic - I just get a gastrointestinal reaction but that would ruin a day or two of the trip! What is the best way to make sure my food will not have mollusks in it? I'd like to have some seafood. What things should I avoid and what should I say to someone to ask if the dish has mollusks in it? Thank you

 I'm looking for a cruise which covers the main highlights in Halong Bay, including Ti Top Island and any of the floating villages.
 Ideally the price of the cruise would include travel to and from Hanoi as that's where we are staying.
 Budget is between £150-200.
 Thanks! 🛳️

 so as advice to all traveling to hcm airport, only book taxi from companies and issues receipt, but now a days vinasun and malinh counters or liason taxi handlers started to behave more like gangsters, that's why i started using taxi companies before the exit, looks like im running out of options, except to book grab or gojek

A few folks I met along the way had warned me about Hanoi. I had bought some donuts for 50k. I did not have any small change so I gave her 500k and asked for 450k back. She pretend to gave me an extra donut and move away so I asked for my change. She brought out her purse and said this was what I gave her (50k). I had to wait for another order from another vendor and by the time I went back to her, she had already disappeared! Just be careful and use small changes especially with street vendors!

 This past week I started getting diarrhea. Not in the ill, going multiple times a day way. But every morning I wake up a bit earlier than usual with the urge to go. And my stool is like water.
 Normal appetite, no cramps, no nausea, nothing. I’m vegetarian, so haven’t eaten any weird meats.
 The first night it started was after I did a caving tour. We used our guide’s water filter straw but that was it. Also, seems a bit fast for it to be related to that? Either way, I don’t know. Just a thought. 
 Otherwise I feel fine! Great energy. It’s just that my usual daily bowel movement is watery diarrhea.
 Suggestions?

 Also what are typical costs of things over there eg grocery, street food, etc ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am a native Vietnamese. I am going to do some jobs with a few people in the Philippines. Since they will pay me when the jobs are done, I want to know how to transfer money from Philippines to Vietnam. I don't have Philippines bank accounts and am currently living in Vietnam.
 There is only one option I know is using PayPal but the fee it charges me really expensive.
 For those having some experiences, can you share with me the way how to deal with?
 Thanks in advanced.

What platform do people here use to connect and network ? Where should I look for events or gatherings ? I’m thinking about visiting some co-working spaces, joining meetup.com events and search for FB-groups. I’m thankful for any info or tip.
 Have a great day people !

 I grew up on a farm in the midwest of the US, and I love animals. I actually think cows and pigs are just as smart and loving, if not more, than dogs, so I realized that I don't really have an issue eating dogs due to abuse because cows/pigs in the US are brutalized far more than dogs in vietnam (look up factory farming practices in the US if you don't believe me, it is truly an abomination).
 However, I'd like to "kill two birds with one stone", if you will. Can anyone recommend me a high quality restaurant (don't want to eat some street dog/cat or something) that serves both dog and cat? I would like to try both, but I don't want to go to two separate establishments to try.

 However, on Voz, I've seen some Vietnamese incorporate history into their viewpoint. Some people believe that modern Japanese people are "disgusting" because they are descended from bad people.
 I'm curious if any of the Vietnamese people here have similar thoughts. For example, should we be cautious around a Japanese person simply because they are Japanese?
 I don't ask this question just because. I'm about to start working for a Japanese company in Vietnam, and I don't want anything like this to get in my way.

 The VinFast Fadil, after some initial research, seems like a solid option. It's both cheaper in VN and seemingly has more features than the competitors like the Toyota Wigo, Honda Brio, or Chevrolet Spark...
 However, I haven't been able to find any decent English reviews of the car online. Can anyone who has owned one share their experiences? Are they a reliable car? Worth the 380 million or so to purchase one?

 Does anyone have any suggestions for some not-for-profit organisations that might benefit from our tourism / donations / contributions? 
 For example, when I visited Bolivia some years ago I joined a not-for-profit tour group that took us on hikes to see the mountains, and the money we spent was used to benefit the local communities. 
 Thanks!

I’m used to mopeds a little and we rented one earlier in our trip on Langkawi in Malaysia. But Vietnam traffic is something else lol, I feel confident enough to do it but wondering what other people’s experiences driving Ninh Binh to Tam Coc is? Outside the town how safe are the roads? Thank u in advance and if there’s anything we should see while I’m Tam Coc any recommendations would be welcome!

 There are a few things I will stay away from, mostly bugs/spiders/roaches, etc, but I've eaten crickets and scorpions.
 I am a bit torn because I researched that you can find dog in Vietnam and that it's actually pretty common. I'm debating on whether or not I should try it. Is it safe to eat? Like are these dogs bred to be eaten or are they diseased street animals that are caught and cooked?
 By the way, while I love dogs, I find it somewhat hypocritical that people will turn a blind eye to the atrocious factory farming practices deployed on cows and pigs, while judging the shit out of people who eat dog. As someone who grew up on a farm, I can tell you that both cows and pigs are just as intelligent, if not more, than most dogs. Cows will actually get to know you and love you, just like a dog, so please let's not judge people who eat dogs when America brutalizes and tortures cows.

My honeymoon is in January, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to go to Vietnam especially with good weather conditions during that time of year. However, I haven’t traveled internationally in over a decade so I’m nervous for the language barrier and ideally I’d want to visit multiple cities but this seems complicated in Vietnam. I also want to see Da Nang’s beach. Is seeing Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and Long Xuyen possible in a two week trip? I’ve been told by people to “hire a driver” but Ho Chi Minh and Long Xuyen are 3 hours apart, so I’m not sure if this is doable. I was thinking of flying of Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh, but I’m not sure how that would be either. Any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated!

Started off as a commuting purpose but soon turned into a hobby/addiction cause of how fun I can get on these pevs especially freely going around the city.
 Id love to take my EUC back to Vietnam but arent too sure about the laws and regulation behind these things, id assume they would be on the same level as those electric moped that the high school kids used to ride on but i can be wrong. Tried doing some research on it but not a lot of results came up. I know these arent technically legal but are they like super restricted or is it like "you are technically not supposed to ride them but I dont care enough" kinda thing. Would love to hear what you have in mind.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, long story short, I had an opportunity to go to Hanoi yesterday and will be leaving in 2 days.
 I'm trying to research things about the country, including what to do and what NOT to do, but I was wondering if anyone could throw a few tips my way, mostly to help me avoid getting scammed.
 I have travelled to a few asian countries- Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and China (Major cities only). Is Vietnam/Hanoi similar to any of those places?
 I guess my questions would be (sorry for the ignorance, usually I research a place I go to for weeks, but I don't really have time for this trip.
 1) Is street food safe to eat? Water at restaurants? Do you ask for "no ice" due to bacteria issues?
 2) What is the best way to get around? Uber? Taxi? etc
 3) Any recommendations on what to do?
 4) Shopping tips? I would like to buy some knives and sandals and cool collectables. I hear knives are very cheap and well made in Vietnam.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 My question is about obtaining my background check for Vietnam. When selecting the purpose of the check, am I supposed to select “for personal review” or “living abroad/visa requirement”? I’m using accurate biometrics, and the only advice I could find is for Korea, which may have different requirements than Vietnam. 
 I have seen that when teaching in Korea, they tell you to select personal review. However that leaves a notice on the paper that states “not valid for use abroad” or something along these terms. However the hagwons seem to accept it anyway, and I’m not sure if that’s the same as Vietnam. 
 Has anyone here used Accurate Biometrics before, and which option did you select before submitting your request? 
 In the second to last drop down box on the demographics page, did you select for personal review, or the “visa requirement/living abroad” option? I want to make sure I check the correct box during the process to ensure I get the proper results needed.

While I have been enjoying my time here, I have Ibeen wondering if the extreme heat and heavy air pollution has been normal in the recent days/weeks. 
 Currently in Hue and from my googling it seems that it is one of the most polluted cities at the moment. Is this business as usual or do people here consider it unusually bad?
 Still, food is great, people are wonderful and life is good!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So yesterday i met a couple of guys from my country and we drank beer and had a good time on the party street. Next thing i know is that im sitting on a random guys scooter on the way to his apartment, i dont remember his face, i dont remember him taking my phone at all. What i remember is just being very upset about losing my phone but still remained relatively calm. In a proper manner, i asked a guy in a green uniform who was nearby when it happend (i think) and it just felt like he was part of it all. 
 The guy has withdrawn more than $600 (the card was in the phonecase", do you think its possible to get this back because i am already on a tight budget... Maybe need to make police report for that and im probably leaving tomorrow. Whats even more scary is how he knew my pin-code. Something that sucks too is that all my pictures are gone. This was a big shit storm and it has completely ruined my mood and now i probably cant continue traveling as long as I planed.
 Has anyone been in this situation before? I would gladly take all tips from you guys.

I want to know how safe I would be, if there are any specific restaurants or types of restaurants you can recommend in the HCMC area? My friend is Viet so she can translate for me, but I do want to be vert careful obviously. I am worried about the cross-contamination and ovsiouly nuts or shellfish being present in a dish I eat. Thank you so much for any advice you have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! Currently planning a trip to Vietnam for 6-7 days in mid June, and would appreciate advice/ opinions on my current (tentative) itinerary! I love temples, museums, and am ok with not seeing any beaches & don’t mind ‘tourist traps’ :) 
 Day 1: Arrive in Da Nang + head to Hoi An 
 Day 2: Explore Hoi An 
 Day 3: Hoi An + head to Da Nang at night/ sleep 
 Day 4: Morning flight from Da Nang > Hanoi + explore Hanoi
 Day 5: Day trip to Halong Bay 
 Day 6: Explore Hanoi 
 Day 7: Explore Hanoi + fly back 
 I omitted Hue just because of the distance from Da Nang & really want to see the lanterns + tailor shops in Hoi An, but I am also wondering if this schedule is too packed. In between squeezing in two regions of Vietnam vs staying in Hanoi the entire trip (and maybe adding in additional day trips) / saving Hoi An + Hue for a later time, which would you all suggest? 
 Thank you :)

 My 2 friends and I are headed to Vietnam from October 9th to 18th. We are wanting to spend 2 nights out of the city hiking or at a beach town. We would prefer that the drive from the city to 2 night stay location is about 3 hours or so. Then, 3 days in the city indulging in food/drinks, day activities, etc. 
  
Should we go to Hanoi or HCMC?
 I did a little research and saw that it was a bit colder and slightly rainy. Kind of like winter. I'm curious about what locals say the weather is like there during the middle of October.
 For Hanoi and HCMC what are the best hikes/towns/beach areas to spend 2 nights at?
  
Any other recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I've noticed that alot of Vietnamese women aren't tanned at all, for example their hands and face are the same color and not different skin tones like i have. I'm pretty light skinned but just got super tanned cuz i was out today. Any tips on how yall avoid getting tanned?

 hello everyone! this is my first post here, but I’d really like to get some feedback on this as i just had this idea pop into my head this morning. 
 so my fiancé is vietnamese and he’s back in vietnam visiting family after having moved away about 13 years ago. he’s from saigon. 
 i’ve been trying to get him to teach me vietnamese but he hasn’t been very good at it 🤣 i’m very familiar with self studying languages as i’ve been studying mandarin for about 12 years now, so i’m more than willing to get a few resources to learn on my own and just ask him questions when i have any. 
 any and all recommendations would be greatly appreciated! specific book/show/movie/etc recommendations preferred since my fiancé doesn’t really know what to look for since he’s not familiar with modern learning resources available in Vietnam.

There are many different kind of banana plants and I especially like the one being grown here in Vietnam so I'd really like to take one home. I can't get one like this in my home country so this is the only way. From what I know I have to carry a phytosanitary certificate for this. Now, I have a couple of questions:
 1.) what exactly is a banana plant called in vietnamese and in what kind of shop can I buy one? Most garden shops don't sell those. They grow everywhere but I can't just steal one, right?
 2.) for phytosanitary certificate I found this site. I'm at a hotel in Hanoi so I could just drive there. My main concerns are: Are 7 days enough time? Do I need a real adress in Vietnam? What would it cost?

 But I've seen this notice in my hotel. Is this true, should I be concerned? Or do you think this is the hotel trying to sell tours?
 I have a license to ride a motorcycle and have the right international license for Vietnam. Is this still illegal?
 Thanks. Any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a sourcing freelancer and I found that many businesses would like to work with Vietnam but there is no trade platform to connect Vietnamese factories to worldwide buyers. They can go to Alibaba but it's full of traders on there. And Alibaba is expensive for small factories. Anyone that in e-commerce could give me an insight why there is no trading platform for Vietnamese factories?

 Does anyone has experience with ILA and VUS I would definitely appreciate any previous experiences as my current advisor for the job is not responding back at all, and none of my colleagues can reach her either to further process me. I’m thinking I will go on their website and reapply, also apply to VUS. Any advice and experience stories is much appreciated.
 I really would like to know about the work cultures, salary differences (I’ve seen other posts and I believe they’re around the same) and how reliable both are in terms of getting people processed effectively without issues.

 I’m getting going to Saigon for beginning a TESOL career, and I figure I’d give some insight into my current expenses saved as an aviation ”engineer” in the states and see what everyone thinks on do-ability with moving abroad based on the current savings and all. 
 For starters, I’m in my mid-twenties, been an aviation “engineer” for a couple years and absolutely despise every single aspect of it besides the pay. I have about $25,900 (₫607,000,000) saved after travel expenses and hotel accommodations. And have all the useful medicinals, adapter, luggage, devices, etc. that I will both want and need for the move. I have my business visa, company processed and getting my work permit, bachelors degree, TESOL certificate, but I still need some advice from here on how to get m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my recent (first) visit to Vietnam, I loved a bunch of things. However, observed a strange behaviour at the jewellery stores in HCMC. We were staying near Binh Thanh market and there were a bunch of jewellery shops there. Strangely enough, a couple of them, I think those were gold & diamond stores, did not allow us to enter and were very rude. In one such outlet (picture attached), the guard blocked our way, and just kept saying "No". Not sure if they were just prejudiced against us (Indians) or was it something else. Racism is something I have never observed in oriental countries.

I knew what I was getting into when I started but they are somehow worse than even I expected. Regardless most teachers have left the company and they are searching for American teachers specifically. On paper they offer a pretty good contract but they don’t fulfill any of those commitments. I know there’s probably a million other posts like this but I just wanted to bring it home again that Apax Leaders should be avoided altogether unless you enjoy working for free.

However, does anyone have any more details on this?

 Did, by any chance, Vietnam simply copy their signs from the Soviets/Russia, taking their obvious friendly relations into account?

 I can’t get the exact translation in google translate but it says something along the lines of people in love. I don’t want her to get the wrong idea because we are not in a romantic relationship.

I know many people visit Vietnam for vacation or to take some time off, as hill stations in India have become increasingly expensive and overcrowded. I talked with a few friends, and they had such a great time there visiting and talking with you folks, so really, thank you for your hospitality
 I would love to know did you have people met any Indian tourists here and what were your general impressions of us.

I know there's direct flights to Da Nang from Korea but surely Korea is nice enough to just vacation at home instead? Is Vietnamese cuisine is incredibly popular with Koreans or is it the exchange rate? Are there a lot of Korean companies in Vietnam nowadays (meaning they aren't actually tourists but they live & work here)? Genuinely curious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I’ll be staying in Hanoi next week and was wondering if there are any hobby water polo teams around which I can join for training. Back in Germany I am part of our University team and I’d love to play/train/connect during my holidays. 
 Let me know if you there is a team I could contact! 
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Khi xem các phim Hồng Kông, Trung Quốc cũ trên các kênh SCTV, mình thấy giọng lồng tiếng không giống với giọng diễn viên miền trong trên các phim Việt Nam chiếu cùng kênh.
 Mình thắc mắc liệu giọng lồng tiếng này có phải là một giọng được phát minh ra giống như giọng Mid-Atlantic trong phim Hollywood cũ không. Hay là cái giọng trong mấy phim Châu Tinh Trì là có thật?

I can tell because I'll overhear them speaking in their accent, or they just look stereotypically British (lots of tattoos, women tend to be on the stockier side).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have this annoying pet peeve when it comes to parking my motorbike, whether it is in front of a restaurant or in some motorbike parking that when I come back I always find my bike: 1) moved somewhere else and mashed between other motorbikes, 2) the dude is sitting on my motorbike and smoking a cigarette, 3) both 1 and 2. I’ve been living here for about 5 years now and it still bothers me til this day. If I frequent a place then I usually build a relationship with the guy and give him a little extra coffee money to leave my bike where it is and to not do the things I stated above so it works out. But, when it’s a new place that I barely go to I usually don’t have that luxury and I become quite annoyed by this experience every time. I have a little bit of OCD and care about the condition of my motorbike and would like to keep it in nice condition. It really bothers me that I spend a lot of time and money to keep it nice just for some guy who doesn’t give a fuck to erase all those efforts in a matter of 10 minutes and scratch it all up. I understand that I don’t deserve special treatment when there are other people besides me, but this standard of service shouldn’t be ok especially when it’s my personal property and I am parking to be a customer at the place. 
 If this sort of thing also bothers you, how do you deal with it? I find that most locals with old and beaten bikes do not care. But what if you have a nice modded bike or even a big bike that costs 150mil + vnd? Any suggestions or tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am returning to Vietnam this year (in a few weeks) and I’d like to find some stuff to do that’s a bit different to the typical tourist activities. I’ve booked two weeks in Ho Chi Minh City (located I. District 1) and will be hiring a motorbike to get around (not opposed to getting on a domestic flight though).
 I spent 1 month travelling around Vietnam last year and had an amazing time, I’ve always been curious around this country and the people and I was not disappointed! 
 I am a contemporary artist and work for a University of Fine Arts in Australia so I am really looking for creative things to partake in. There must be a network of musicians and artists in this wonderful city of millions!? When researching online for things to check out it seems like only the really obvious stuff comes up (I can’t help but wonder if it’s because I’m searching from within Australia). I want to see exhibitions by local, innovative artists, maybe undertake some workshops in craft traditions and music gigs by exciting Vietnamese bands! Where can I go or what venues offer this? (not interested in night clubs haha). Thanks for any suggestions ✌️🙏👍

I have multiple long term plans of what I am trying to do here in Vietnam, so I will be staying in Da Nang indefinitely. I am looking for a place that I can volunteer in exchange of accommodation, whether it would be teaching kids English, taking care of the elderly, or tending to the victims of agent orange, v.v...
 Doing this will give me a chance to integrate and connect with the locals easier. This is what I did when I first moved to Thailand and also in Portugal. In the meantime during my volunteering, I would be exploring, trying to get familiar with the area and also attempting to find my own place. Will be truly grateful for anyone who has experience in volunteering in Da Nang and be willing to share and help me out with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody !
 I'm from France and I visited Vietnam in october 2018. I loved your country so much, it must have been the best travel of my life. After that, I got interested in vietnamese culture, the food, the language, the music. I listened to popular vietnamese songs on Youtube. Not the oldschool, historically famous ones. More like the hits of the last few years.
 ​
 I remember listening to one song in particular and I just can't find it anymore. It wasnt the best song or anything, but it bugs me because I can see the video clip in my head and it's frustrating. Here is what I know about it : 
  
The main singer was a man 
 It was released before the end of 2019
 The clip is at night, in a big city. A man and a woman are having fun, getting drunk, playing pool. And there's an underlying love story
 I think he's hoping something happens betweem them 
 I think it was rap. But maybe not 100% rap ? 
  
I know it's not much... But if it rings a bell to anyone, it would make my day and remind me great memories ! Thank you

Asked around in the convenience stores and from the little bit we could communicate through google translate, all of them said they don’t sell cigarettes in the area. Will I get some at Circle K in District 1 or just from roadside sellers? (Haven’t gone beyond my area because work ends at dusk, and I did go out the first day after work but got spooked because got approached by different men twice asking where I am from and stuff so not stepping out in the evening anymore)

From our research we saw that Viettel was the best so we walked over to the Viettel stall to the far right of the airport when you get off and bought a SIM card. They put it in my phone and taped my old SIM to the card that came with the new sim like they do in every country when you do this. I had to ask for a sim removal tool (usually it comes with the new sim pack) and the lady dug up a paper clip (This was my first clue something was wrong) and taped that to the card as well. I’d been kinda distracted because of the full theater you have to go through with the passport pictures and then your picture and then they call in both and a live operator video chats you to make sure you’re real.

 I check majority of Fahasa bookstores when I pass them and the occasional stationery shop but I can't seem to find this specific brand. Not available on Shopee, Lazada, etc. either ):
 I would love for any specific shop names if you know any, and any other suggestions as well! Ordering and shipping directly from the website is kinda my last resort.
 Thank you in advance! ((:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So me and my partner were walking in some park in HCMC and a guy appeared from nowhere and started pointing at my partner’s shoe. We didn’t understand what he meant so he came closer and took out a funny brush from his “shoe repair and maintenance box” and started quickly washing my bf’s shoes. We both said “No” about five times and soon there was another guy attacking my shoes. They basically took of our shoes from our feet - pretended to wash them with their super duper chemicals and glued an extra heel on my bf’s Birkenstock sandals (which of course came off after a few days and looks hilarious). After finishing their grand hard work of one minute they asked us 500.000 dongs from each of us (~40 euros in total). It’s not that I didn’t expect for them to ask money, I understood it from the very beginning but they were really good and quick in undressing us.. I gave them 500.000 (shouldn’t have) and they asked for another half. I literally showed them my wallet - I didn’t have that much. It is funny that they didn’t agree to take less than 500.000 - they were insisting on their price and I started finally showing my attitude, saying that we didn’t want their “service” in the first place and that we don’t have more money. So I told them let’s call the police. They didn’t like the idea and their hooligan leader took my bf’s shoe and threw it in the trash bin direction. We quickly vanished afterwards. So, our stupidity is not under a question mark - it was our first day in Vietnam, we were probably jetlagged and awed, and just fools. However, we indeed said “no” many many times and actually the next level would’ve been shouting, which we didn’t even consider and our politeness costed us 500000 dongs. My question is about the police - which side would’ve they taken? I assume this shoe business is illegal and we would’ve been right? But I saw so many people in forms in the city (I assume - policemen) - how come is their business still running?

I will join a tour for most of my stay but was planning on arriving in advance to get over jet lag and relax a bit. Do you have any tips for my safety and to avoid scams? Where should I stay and what transport is best from the airport? I read about some taxi scams? I'd be happy to splurge a bit to be in a nice hotel with a swimming pool where I could meet other travellers perhaps and explore the area in advance of the tour (50-75 euro per night). Also, should I have predominantly cash in the local currency? Any generic advice would be appreciated as I'm getting nervous!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, my partner and I live together with his parents, but we are not married. We also live in a European country. My partner has lived here since birth and his parents came here i think shortly after the war. They are both from northern Vietnam. I have only lived here for 4 years. I refer to them as bố and mẹ since I'm learning Vietnamese, and bố told me that since my partner and I are living together, it is the same as being married in Vietnam, and that it's fine for me to call them bố and mẹ since its normal to call your in-laws mom and dad, and this is also common in the culture that I grew up in. The issue/thing that is confusing me is that while neither have an issue with me calling them that, bố always responds for himself as bố , while mẹ switches between mẹ and cô. I only use simple vietnamese at the moment, but an example would be:I: khi nào bố sẽ đi làm ? B: bố đi làm lúc (time)
 Mẹ would use the same or respond with cô. Is this a regional or cultural thing, or is this because there is no blood relation? I don't think I have heard her use it with my partner or her daughter, but it oculd be that I missed it because I'm still learning the language. I also thought that it might be similar to how bạn, tôi is used as another exception pronoun. Do other non-vietnamese people also refer to their vietnamese in-laws in the same way?

 However, I cannot just look it up online because what is posted about how the government works is not how it goes in real life. 
 For example this was on the official government site: The Constitution clearly indicates that the state power is in the hand of the people. The State is of the people, by the people and for the people.

I visited my wife’s family in HCMC and now I have dreams of coming to live there too. I, of course, would try to find our own place to live as I would never want to burden my wife’s family.
 However, when telling my wife’s family that I want to move there they continuously tell us never to move there. When asked if they would ever move to the USA they always say no because it is boring, dangerous, and they love the life they have in Vietnam. I don’t understand why someone would tell me not to live somewhere if they would not leave that place at the first opportunity. They live a great life in Vietnam and my wife’s brother is always taking trips to other nearby countries and buying expensive things as a flight attendant. 
 I make a lot more money here in the USA, but with the rising cost of living and potential economic recession, I wish for a life that is much simpler. Am I wrong for wanting that? Am I wrong for thinking they might be hypocrites? Am I wrong for thinking I could have a much more comfortable life there? Please let me know.

When the bill comes it’s often strangely expensive. Don’t feel like I’ve been to overly touristy places but it seems odd to me, don’t imagine locals pay these prices? Granted it is my fault stopping in places with no prices advertised. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 I'm near done mapping out a trip to Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. I have a hostel for Ho Chi Minh but plan to just find places to stay as I go and stop. I’m getting a motorbike so these places that are for 1 day are just stop overs with maybe ¾ of the day for exploring, hence the odd day calculations…just want to be realistic.
 In total the trip is 29 days long but ultimately wondering what people’s opinions are at the times in these locations? Am I spending too much/too little time in places or prioritizing the wrong places? The only thing set in stone is Ha Long Bay, I’ll need to be there by the 26th day. My hostel in HCMC is also booked but was $12/night so is a wash if things change.
 The trip is pretty linear so things to an extent can be cut and put other places. Would love folks opinions cause most things I read say everywhere is amazing and I don’t have all the time haha!
 (3.75 days) Days 1 to 5 Ho Chi Minh City
 *I originally had 3 days is this too much time at 4 days? Worried Jet lag will put me out of commission for the day, but I arrive around noon my first day
 (1.75 days) Day 5 to 7 Phan Thiet/Mui Ne
 *Should I take a day here and give it to Dalat? Should I skip?
 (.75 days) Day 7 to 8 Dalat
 (1.75 days) Day 8 to 10 Nha Trong
 (.75 days) Days 10 to 11 Quy Nhon
 *Could go straight to Pleiku but have heard good things about Quy Nhon?
 (.75 days) Days 11 to 12 Pleiku
 (2.75 days) Days 12 to 15 Hoi An/Da Nang
 (1.75 days) Days 15 to 17 Hue
 (1.75 days) Days 17 to 19 Phong Nha
 *Wanted to do only 1 day but think if I wanna see the caves will need a whole extra day
 (.75 days) Days 19 to 20 Vinh or Thai Hoa
 *OR I am going to skip and take a bus from Dong Hoi to Ninh Binh saving a day
 (1.75 days) Days 20 to 22 Ninh Binh
 (3.75 days) Days 22 to 26 Hanoi
 (2.75 days) Days 26 to 28 Ha Long Bay *Already booked
 (1 day) Day 28-29 Stay Near Airport in Hanoi and Go Home

It's both for them just for fun but also in case one of them develops dementia or Alzheimer's disease. If you didn't know, playing music from someone's formative years can help them have clear and lucid moments if they have a cognitive degenerative disease. 
 Does anyone have specific artist suggestions and where to find them? I am in the US so I usually use Youtube or Spotify to search for music and I'm not aware of what services in VN would have music from that era. Anyway, when I have searched on google, I see a lot of articles about early rock and roll in Sai Gon. I don't think my parents would have listened to that or gone to any of those clubs since they are from Central and rarely traveled to Sai Gon. 
 I believe it would be very meaningful to my parents so thank you in advance.

 I bought a total of 11 key chains and 3 magnets for 270k at the gift shop for family and friends. 
 It's a cash only place and while counting my money, 2x100k, 2x10k and 1x500k instead of 50k, while I was checking my money but the old lady at the shop snatched the money. I just got back to the hotel after 4 hours of walking and exploring. 
 Any Vietnamese folks here think it's even remotely possible to retrieve or forget and enjoy the rest of the trip here?
 TL;DR - Lost 500k vnd instead of 50k note because cashier lady rushed and snatched it before we could double check.

 I am a Vietnamese international student studying Accounting (kế toán) in the United States and I was wondering what the job market is like for accountants in Vietnam? 
 Ive basically grown up here in the US, and I do not know if my accounting degree will benefit me in Vietnam. My main questions are: 
  
How is the job market for accountants? Are accountants in demand with the rapid economic growth Vietnam is having? 
 
What is the avg salary for accountants in Vietnam? 
 
Will a US degree of Accounting benefit my career in Vietnam, as I know Vietnam has different accounting procedures compared to Western procedures?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could someone please describe the VUS curriculum for learning English as an adult to me? Or point me to somewhere that describes it in English?
 Specifically, I heard there is a level / lesson 1 that costs ~$1,000 USD / ~24 million VND. I'm wondering how proficient one would be at English at the end of that? Also, I'm wondering how long it takes for someone to get through that course on average?
 Bonus question: how many levels are there in total for learning English? What is taught in those levels and how long does it take an average adult to complete them?
 Thanks!

He is now fluent in the spoken and written language (although he’s read a bunch of classic literature so some people tell him he speaks like he’s from the 1920s hahaha). He’s traveled in Vietnam for probably 1.5 years total. 
 The other night I was showing him this old book I found about social etiquette in the US in the early 1900s. It had very specific things like “how to write a letter of apology” or “how to help someone out of a carriage.“ As we were reading, he said, “I wish I could find a book like this about the nuances of Vietnamese culture!”
 I’ve looked around the internet, but because I cant speak Vietnamese, most of the books I find are travel books for people that don’t know anything about the country. I’d love suggestions about books written in Vietnamese about the “unspoken“ rules and nuances of Vietnamese culture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I will be coming to Vietnam at the end of May. I was planning to do an overnight cruise in Ha Long Bay during my trip, however some of the threads have me a bit concerned. 
 A lot of posts in different forums have mentioned about the bay being extremely dirty with floating garbage in most places and smelling of diesel everywhere. Since a lot of these posts are from different years I want to know from someone who has been there recently if that is still the case? If so how badly does it affect the experience? I'm mostly interested in the views and maybe kayaking so please tell according to that. I also read some suggesting to opt for day cruise instead but I have my heart set on spending at least one night under the stars with scenic view on the cruise, are my expectations too much?
 Is it worth spending extra for better quality cruises? I don't plan on splurging what the best 5 star cruises cost, so will probably look for a relatively cheap 5 star or a 4 star cruise. Are they considerably better than the budget/3 star cruises or if I'm not going for the top tier it makes no difference?
 Is Lan Ha Bay a better option? As long as the views are good I won't mind a switch. If the views are not that good but the crowd is considerably less then I will even prefer it. I can compromise on activities a bit as well.
 Please let me know your thoughts.

 So where can I get a full parasite test in Hanoi?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody,
 I’m a landscape architecture student at the university of life sciences in Warsaw. Currently me and a group of other students are starting work on a project of a small garden that belongs to the Museum of Asia and the Pacific. There are elements already present there that were built and funded by the Vietnamese community of Warsaw (the biggest being a mini version of the pagoda on one leg from Hanoi) that we will be designing around. I would like to ask you - what is one significant aspect/element of your culture that you would like to have represented in such a garden?

They didn't prescribe me an epipen but I want one for peace of mind. 
 Is this possible here? Do I need a prescription or can I go to a pharmacy and buy one? Do they even exist here?

How easy it is to organise service: getting wifi set up, a couch delivered, Grab food. Everything is so quick!
 
In my opinion, people are kinder in Vietnam. There’s something about the way people interact and occupy space which seems more collegial. 
 
The cost of living is so much less oppressive. I know it’s a privilege to be able to say that. 
 
 I’ve been here since 2015, living and working full-time. So, before anyone asks if I’m in expat honeymoon phase…nope.

I didn't get to buy more before leaving, and now I want to buy a good amount and ship it to the U.S. However, all of the websites that I found selling the same face wash only ship within Vietnam. Does anyone know any way I can get it shipped to the U.S.? Alternatively, is there a similar face wash I can get in the U.S.? A lot of the U.S. brands are really bad for my skin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading an article about the oscar winning actor Ke huy quan, who was part of an ethnic chinese minority community in vietnam. He lived in a mainly chinese area of saigon and fled the country with his family after the south lost. The article mentions that “most” of the people who left south vietnam in the 70s were of chinese origin as well. This was surprising to me as i always thought it was mainly people of viet descent and maybe only a few chinese (I only know what i was told since im 2nd gen and was born way after my grandparents left). But do you think this was likely true about boat people being mostly chinese? If so why would mainly chinese people have been the ones to leave vietnam after the end of the war?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as the subject says… I’m an oxycodone addict - and could use some advice… 
 I am tremendously embarrassed that I’ve gotten myself into this position, but long story short - I recently sold a business to a large multi-national corporation who has an office in Ho Chi Minh. I’ll be traveling to the office next week - but am concerned about the risks associated with traveling through customs with oxycodone pills… without them I’d be going through intense withdrawals, so I have to either do the trip and bring pills with me, or find an excuse to cancel the trip outright - which would have some pretty damaging outcomes (and could literally reduce my remaining earn-out from the acquisition by millions of dollars usd).
 I’m not looking for comments on getting clean or other judgements at this phase - I have my own plans for how I’m going to achieve that once the financial aspect of the sale and related earn-outs are completed…. But I do want to better understand the risks id be taking if I travel to VN and going through customs with oxy pills.
 Can someone help clarify what the laws are? Especially for USA foreigners traveling for work?
 To be clear - I don’t have a script and when I travel in the USA I just put them in a pill bottle for an old unrelated medication. Considering doing the same here - but haven’t travelled to VN before and I’m seeing conflicting details on the web about our drug laws and related punishments.
 Thanks for your help and non judgement!

 Hàn Mặc Tử is also a man who really likes making poems in the new style (he will never be someone like Xuân Diệu who is just a man that adopted the French's poems and turned it into his own style). His early works before he got lyprosy were very similar to Xuân Diệu, the newest poets of the movement. After that though, his poems suddenly changes style to reflect on the suffering he had to endure, while maintaining his love for life around.
 It's weird, but the way he used words that are just plain visceral, and sometimes is borderline insane (his style was the crazy one during the movement). There's a certain level of sur…]]></summary>

 Some of you guys may know about Pro Wrestling - an art with combination of stage techniques and wrestling together to entertain people. Or you will familiarize with the name WWE, home of many famous athletes like John Cena, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Dave Bautista,..etc. At Saigon there was a group of many young and talented guys with the love for pro wrestling call Vietnam Pro Wrestling (VPW for short). They have trained and organized many shows to Vietnam fans. Starting from a small dance studio with 30-50 people, wrestling on mat to nowaday performing on real wrestling ring, with attendance around 200-300 people per show.
 This June 3rd, they will organized their biggest event in the year called Ultimate Collision. Beside our Vietnamese wrestlers, we will have attendance from other wrestlers in Southeast Asia. So if you guy want to experience a burning hot and energetic Saturday night, maybe take your free time to attend their incoming show. More details on Vietnam Pro Wrestling facebook page.

 Vietnam has a marriage divorce rate at around 0.2 per 1000 people or around 5-10% of all vietnamese people will get divorced. Compared to the US were almost 50% of married people will get a divorce. That is about a 10x of the rate in US. Anyone has some light to shed on the reason why this is the case? Comment from article. 
  
Lowest Divorce Rate in the World Vietnam possesses the lowest divorce rate in the world, at 0.2 per 1,000 people. This is an impressive feat for a country with a population of over 97 million, as it indicates that couples in the region are more likely to stay together than those living elsewhere in the world. In addition to this, Vietnam has one of the highest marriage rates overall. The culture puts considerable emphasis on family and loyalty within relationships, which helps explain why divorce rates are so low. Furthermore, marriage is seen as a means of protection from poverty or any other form of financial instability as couples share costs and resources. Finally, societal norms and expectations play a major role; especially amongst older generations who frown upon divorce and may even threaten older married couples with social exclusion if they decide to end their marriages. All these factors combine to result in very low divorce rates in Vietnam compared to other countries around the world.

 Does Vietnam allow certain amounts of gore, blood, or violence to be shown in TV shows or movies or is it really limited in what can be seen? Is nudity allowed in media or is it partially censored like in countries like Japan? Is porn illegal in the country or is it allowed?
 Sorry for the questions but I was just curious to know what directors and writers are dealing with when creating shows or films in the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have browsed on many Vietnamese forums, subreddits and even Youtube videos. Once or twice, I would see a Vietnamese netizen drop this word Tây Lông.
 Apparently this is a word used to ridicule Westerners in general, as it translates literally to “hairy Westerners”. I have seen very negative attitudes towards Westerners in communities such as r/trotruyenlinhtinh, where they seem to have a negative bias against Westerners.
 Personally I would never stoop down that low and use that word, regardless of the social situations, like even if a Western tourist was rude. But how is the word perceived by Vietnamese people? Should this word be considered rude and offensive?
 EDIT: Apologise, the subreddit name is r/trochuyenlinhtinh, instead of r/trotruyenlinhtinh, rookie mistake on my Vietnamese spelling part lol

But it was portguese missionaries who where the first Europeans that came to vietnam and latinize the classically written classical script of Vietnamese.
 So my question is, does anyone know more history about how the portuguese language influenced Vietnamese? I was learning brazilian portuguese independently and noticed some similarities with Vietnamese. For example the use of the ~ tilde accent mark, and the "nh" constant cluster sounding like "y". I was able to find this article and a few comments on the Vietnamese alphabet Wikipedia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 Recently I am considering studying Data Analytics for a possible Data Analyst/Business Analyst job (heard they're often strongly related), so I wanted to ask some questions about the market here in Vietnam or East Asia with a specific focus on foreigners, since I am one.
 Hope there is someone in this group currently doing these types of job here in Vietnam or in East Asia that can provide some insights.
 I have a Bachelor degree in Chinese studies, so not related, just recently completed an internship in my country's chamber of commerce here in Vietnam.
 I would start from scratch and self-study online (I know it's not easy but I did it before and got some certifications on Coursera, Udemy etc...).
 Questions:
 1) Is there a fundamental language barrier when it comes to the data in relationship to the country you are working in? More specifically, will the data be in the local language? / Do you need to have proficiency in the local language in order to find a job in the field?
 2) Is it sensible for a foreigner to search for those types of job or will a local professional always be preferred?
 3) Briefly, how would you describe your experience in this field here in Vietnam or East Asia as a foreigner? Positives, negatives, up, downs?
 4) Finally, do you have any tips or recommendations?
 Thought this may be useful for any foreigner wondering about their career in Asia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in a city is Massachusetts (USA) that has a large population of Vietnamese immigrants but I only ever see the South Vietnamese flag. Never the actual flag of Vietnam. Does Vietnam have a portion of its people that are still bitter of the unification or is it just something that is an American thing? I assume there is but Im not sure. Not sure if I phrased this question properly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know reddit is not the best place for to ask for advice on life changing decisions, but I'm struggling to make a decision. I've booked a flight to Vietnam, which is less than 1 month away, but I'm on the verge of canceling the whole thing. 
 To give a bit of background, I've lived in the UK for almost half of my life. I left Vietnam during my high school years and have been working/studying here ever since. I have a good job, earning well above average wage and I'm happy with all aspects of my life here. 
 I go back to Vietnam once in a while and was surprised by how much things have changed. There definitely are a lot of opportunities there, especially when it comes to having your own start up firm, and potentially earn way more than if I continue as a salary worker in the UK after taking into account of the cost of living. That and the fact that my parents are getting old and I want to spend time with them, made me want to go back. 
 However, within the last 2 months, as I've been saying goodbye to everything and everyone I know here, I just feel a sense of sadness that I'm leaving my comfortable life and good career behind for something that might not work out. I feel like I might be making a big mistake. To make it worse, I'm almost certain now that my relationships with my parents are beyond repair, and we won't get along no matter what. 
 My flight is just a few weeks away and I feel very much like just not going to the airport, and just telling my boss that I'm not leaving anymore and going back to the way it was before.
 I'm just posting it on here in the slim chance that someone might have been in the same boat and have some advice to offer.

I wonder if it's okay when I go to Vietnamese places like Little Saigon and speak with my "Hanoi" accent normally there. I never been to the States before, tho, and I heard a few guys got threatened or discriminated by speaking those accent. Idk if they were just joking or sum tho.
 Moreover, how should I behave there? should I just be normal like in Vietnam or is there something I need to worry about? I'm sorry if my question triggered some of you guys. I know the history and have no hate towards 'boat people' at all. It's just i never been to The States so I really need this kind of information.
 Btw, thanks for helping me my fellow redditors, hope y'all have productive day 😁

Despite his modest means, Thực had a deep reverence for the role of food in Vietnamese culture and a compassionate heart that drove him to help those in need.
 One day, as he was preparing his banh bao for the day, he was visited by a strange, otherworldly presence. The entity introduced itself as Ong Tao, the kitchen god, and explained that it had been watching Thực's selfless work and recognized his desire to help others through the power of food.
 In recognition of Thực's compassion and dedication, Ong Tao bestowed upon him a great gift: the ability to be in multiple places at once, and a cart with a bottomless supply of banh bao. With this power, Thực could feed anyon…]]></summary>

Từ sau lần cuối xảy ra sự kiện đó, chúng ta đã quá quen thuộc với cái nóng và đã dần thích nghi với nó. Đã gần 300 năm kể từ khi những con quái vật từ trong mặt trời xuất hiện. Chúng ta đã chiến đấu và kết quả nhận được là sự diệt vong trên diện rộng do bão mặt trời từ những con quái vật gây ra. Trong một khu bảo an cuối cùng của nhân loại. Cương vội rít nhẹ điếu thuốc lá có thể xem là còn sót lại cuối cùng trên vũ trụ này. Vốn dĩ anh không hề thích thuốc lá, nhưng từ sau khi chứng kiến Dương, người bạn thân giàu sinh ra tử cùng mình lại biến mất một cách bí ẩn thì anh ta cũng đã thay đổi thói quen và tính cách. Ngày hôm nay cũng như mọi ngày Cương vẫn vậy. Tay cầm khẩu súng và leo lên trạm quan sát. Từ góc nhìn này anh có thể nhìn thấy toàn cảnh khu bảo an. Những đứa nhóc chạy chơi xung quanh những bãi cỏ bị cháy và những người lớn đang canh tác trên những cánh đồng khô héo, xa hơn có thể thấy những thành phố mà anh chỉ được nghe kể về thời kỳ mà con người vẫn còn làm chủ hành tinh này từ những người lớn tuổi. Bất giác anh như vô thức lau đi những giọt mồ hôi chen lẫn nước mắt khi nghĩ về nó. Rồi anh lại hướng mắt xa hơn về phía đó. Bất chợt anh thấy từ xa có vẻ có người đang đi về phía trại bảo an. Ngay lập tức anh ra hiệu cảnh báo để toàn trại vào trạng thái chiến đấu. Các hệ thống cảnh báo vang lên gầm rú như tiếng súng nổ. Các ụ súng và hệ thống tên lửa được kích hoạt, các chiến binh đều đã vào hệ thống công sự để phòng thủ. Bất ngờ Cương vội ra hiệu tắt hệ thống cảnh báo và phòng thủ vì hình như anh nhận ra điều gì đó... Hết tập 1... Mình mới tập viết truyện để giải sầu vì cuộc sống thực nó quá tiêu cực với mình. Ae xem nếu không thích thì cmt để mình gỡ nha, cảm ơn các bạn ! Vô Danh !!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you guys heard any stories from your parents about period 1975 - 1986 in Vietnam?
 The period of the “Subsidy Economy” (Bao cap) (1975-1986) has been known as a time of hardships, when mechanism for socio-economic management was inappropriate, causing privations in people’s material and spiritual life. Material life was poor due to a sluggish and inefficient production system, but the constraints also applied to people’s creative and spiritual endeavors.
 “Bao cap” was a period during which both the courage and intelligence of millions of people were suppressed and were anxious about liberation. It was a dramatic period, and a profound lesson about the law of social development.
 During this period, food, goods, and services were purchased with coupons or food stamps. Those with a position in government received more coupons and had access to special shops. For those without special status, they could expect to spend almost a day waiting in line to buy rice and other basic commodities. Everything was controlled by the government. Having a bicycle – even one that was ancient and on the verge of breakdown – was considered a luxury. If you were fortunate enough to own one, you'd be on a special list of bicycle owners allowed to buy parts (such as inner tubes, nuts, bolts, etc.).
 My parents met each other in an illiteracy eradication class. They also told me that when they finished secondary, people ran through backgrounds check (which side you supported during the war) and eventually my parents couldn’t go to high school. Can you guys share your family’s stories regarding this period?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We rented motorbikes from Tigit Motorbikes to ride from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. The bikes were awesome. The staff provided us with excellent route options and prepared us for our long journey. The staff was very knowledgeable and the routes were incredible. The bikes were expertly maintained and had great rubber for our long journey. I would recommend using tigit for any length of bike rental, whether it's for a day or a month. Be sure to go through their website if your having any questions regarding driving permits or route options. Thanks Tigit! https://www.tigitmotorbikes.com/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, me and my partner are planning two weeks in Vietnam in either September or early October. We're coming from the UK and want to make the best use of our time. My current thinking is to stay in the North to avoid the bad weather in the centeral region. Would like to visit Hanoi, Ha Long, Sapa and maybe Ninh Binh or one other place. 
 Few questions: - I would love to visit Hue and Hoi An but are we right to avoid these in October? - Most two week sample itineraries cover the whole country , but is there enough to do in the North for two weeks? - Are there any other cities worth visiting in the North? - Would it be worth adding a destination outside of North Vietnam somewhere where the weather is ok e.g. South Vietnam, Cambodia etc?
 Thanks! ☺️

The only problem I’ve had has been getting enough sleep😂. The Nha Nghi I was in on 30/4 was next to a Karaoke place which closed at 3am so no sleep till then (good for them it sounded like a great party.) I decided to find a Nha Nghi outside of town so it would be quiet and rural but a guy turns up outside at 5am and starts having a conversational chat with himself on a megaphone. Is this normal?

The doctor highly recommended the Japanese encephalitis vaccine but said it's 2 shots at $350 each in the US but it would be much cheaper if I just get it when I arrive. I'm flying into Hanoi first, but can't seem to find any clinics in Hanoi that offer it. It looks like it's pretty easy to get it in Bangkok....but before I switch up my plans and buy a ticket from Hanoi to Bangkok just for a shot, I figured it'd be wise to check on here and see if anyone can recommend a clinic in Hanoi that offers this vaccine. Thanks so much!

There exists similar rules for Filipinos working abroad when leaving the Philippines, a kind of archaic form of government control/corruption.

I showed signs of interest many times but he hasn’t asked me to be his girlfriend. I think I am quite pretty blonde, so he may find me attractive. Are Vietnamese guys shy to show their interest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[im a 2nd gen living in australia and i grew up being exposed to the memory of reunification day/black april in a very somber and sad way. my parents/grandparents would sometimes share some memories but they didn’t like to talk about it because i think it was still traumatizing. being born in the 2000s i never experienced it firsthand but it was always something that i was curious about and wanted to learn more about. what does april 30th mean to you? if you were a member of the diasporic vietnamese community how did/do you feel about this day? does it still hold strong emotions for you, whether or not you were there?

But wondering if there are prejudices held. Sometimes I get compliments on my skin tone (I'm lighter skinned but even then I'm paranoid they're secretly taking the piss out of my skin tone)... I feel anxious that the looks I get come from a place of racism/judgement, and sometimes feel like there's a change in attitude when they hear me speak fluent English. Anyway- honesty is appreciated!

I may be a bit more concerned since I came here with my 2 yo. Has there every been like a car seat for scooters? In case anyone thinks going slower while mother holds on is any kind of protection like my wife told me. 8kg crashing at 25km/h exerts a mass force of almost 500kg. Don’t know many babies that would survive that kind of impact or know any moms who could hold onto 500kg. I understand there’s often no other way to travel in Vietnam but at least like a pod or something for the baby to TRY to escape a crash without death or permanent disfigurement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the west we obviously have a reputation for drinking too much hard liquor and far too frequently. 
 But I enjoy a beer about as often as Vietnamese do. 
 That is, on special occasions or social gatherings. 
 My problem is how much beer. I like 1-2 decent quality beers and some good relaxed conversation.
 But I find over here my cup just keeps getting refilled. 4,5,6,7 beers later and the case is empty. It's just too much for my stomach or bladder to handle to be honest. I didn't even drink like that when I was a delinquent teenager. 
 People start getting obnoxious and getting me to say rude and inappropriate things in Vietnamese (which I don't speak very well). And they try to make me say it over and over and over again because they're totally wasted. 
 I miss that culture of the west where you can take part in the drinking circle and everyone just drinks as much as they feel like. No pressure to gulp down 5L each. 
 I honestly like the taste of Tiger. It's a pretty good beer for a mass-produced brew. 
 But I've had to completely give up social drinking while I'm here. My body just can't handle that much anymore. I'm only 27 but I take antidepressants. 
 I don't like to drink alone and my wife doesn't like beer. 
 So that's my story. This Canadian is done drinking beer. I like the taste, hate the drunk. 
 Not meant to be derogatory at all. This is just me expressing myself. I understand every culture is different and I've taken part in the drinking circle once with every new group I meet just to build that trust with them. But from then on I just refuse. It never just stops at 1-2 beers. 
 Also, ice in warm beer? Cold out of the fridge man. Cold out of the fridge. Completely ruins the taste for me.

 Just want to ask all the Vietnamese born abroad a quick question: 
  
Are you learning Vietnamese at the moment and what is your current level?
 What are some types of content that you think are missing on the Internet/in textbooks that you really want to know about in terms of the Vietnamese language?
 If you can already speak Vietnamese to some extent, what kind of content/materials do you think would really help you become fluent?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I speak English originally but I would like to learn this language and visit Vietnam one day. Duolingo and the books I got are helping me understand grammar and how to read the language bit by bit, but I SUCK at speaking it, and I know I do. And I don't know any native speakers personally anymore to help correct my pronunciation. I think I end up overthinking and trying to implement the tones but in doing this I just mess the whole word up lol.
 I've tried saying phrases and words really slow then gradually increasing speed til at a normal speaking cadence and this helps a bit but I was wondering if there was something more efficient. Also I feel like due to my natural voice being kind of deep/bassy and the sort of hard way I tend to pronounce things the naturally softer or more nuanced sounds are kind of harsher than the audio samples I'm hearing. I'm just really having a hard time with this because my voice is deep and somewhat monotone unless I'm excited about something so it's hard to do the tones and when I do I feel like I'm over emphasizing them.
 It's bad enough I tend to even stutter a bit more than usual in English too but I completely butcher this beautiful language almost every time it comes out of my mouth. And I wanna be able to speak to native speakers but not laughably 💀 I know most people are gracious and kind enough to just appreciate you even took the time but still why do it if not correctly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am planning to visit Vietnam soon for my vacation. I am also interested in exploring the possibility of adding 360-degree videos of public street locations to Google Street View that are currently not available on Google Maps. 
 As of now, I have noticed that only major roads have been filmed and added to Google Street View. However, I am curious about the feasibility of capturing more street locations and making them accessible on Google Maps. I understand that it is important to respect privacy and comply with any laws or regulations regarding photography in public spaces. 
 Therefore, I am seeking information on the legal implications of such a project in Vietnam. Specifically, I am interested in knowing if there are any restrictions on filming in public spaces and if capturing 360-degree videos of public street locations is allowed. I would also like to ensure that the project complies with local laws and respects the privacy of individuals. 
 Thank you for any guidance or information you can provide on this matter!

I am dealing with some injurys but have had great success with Active Release Technique (or ART). I was wondering if anyone can reccomend a massage type/parlor that does something similar to this. I know that I probably won't be able to find an ART practicioner while in Hanoi so was wondering what the next best thing may be. For context ART basically involves hitting certain pressure points in soft tissue and manipulating the muscles around them through releases (i know just sounds a regular massage but it's been much more effective than say Thai massages I've had in the past). If anyone has any ideas I'd really appreciate it, thanks!

 Basically where should I definitely avoid?

My last visit to Vietnam was about 5 years ago, and that time was probably the worst food poisoning I've ever experienced, absolute bed ridden for about a week. 
 Any tips on how to avoid food poisoning and what to watch out for? I will be travelling to Vietnam again in a few months time and I'm definitely going to avoid eating raw food, as I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from eating raw fish at a japanese restaurant in Phan Thiet. Many thanks!

 My girlfriend and I are traveling through Vietnam since a week now, and we are enjoying it so much. You have a beautiful country and I’ve seldomly experienced such a degree of hospitality! 
 We arrived late this night in Hanoi and are now looking for activities to fill the upcoming days. If I’ve understood correctly, today is reunification day and tomorrow is workers day? Would there be any parades or festivities in the city, one could attend? 
 Thank you so much in advance and feel free to share anything, you think we could enjoy here.

I am a little worried about there not being much to do or being able to meet other English speakers and making friends. I am curious if anyone here has any insight. What is life like in Thu Dau Mot? Is there much to do for a foreigner? The only other post asking about TDM is a few years old and I was told the area has seen a lot of growth. Has anything changed?
 About me: I am a male, in my 30's, from the USA, and single. I speak no Vietnamese, although I enjoy learning languages and will attempt to learn basics while living in Vietnam. I don't drink or care too much about having access to crazy nightlife, although I like the option of being able to go out occasionally with people. I enjoy nature, riding my motorcycle around, and doing outdoorsy stuff.
 Thanks!

 Looking at buying in bau tram ward in long Khánh city. Where would be the best place to find available properties online?
 Not heading back across until November, so I’m trying to get a feel for the market. 
 Looks to be a few on Facebook, but I’m also concerned about the scams / fake ads. 
 Any direction would be great.

These criminals from lower caste raise chickens and rooster for illegal cock fights and the roosters always crow at 2Am disrupting everyone else’s sleep .It’s sad that the local police favors these criminals since the dirty money get from orchestrating the cock fight pay the police well. Corrupted city that act a safe haven for criminals. What a sad country full of decadency

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I’m an American who’s engaged to a Vietnamese woman and we are living in the US. I noticed pretty early on when she eats she tends to make quite a bit of noise and chews with her mouth open. This is something that kind of drives me insane but I’ve gotten used to it. When I met her parents I noticed her Dad made some interesting noises as well. I did gently tell her once for her own awareness that many Americans consider these things rude or slightly gross, but mostly because I didn’t want her to feel embarrassed if she didn’t know. With things like noodles or soup I can understand to a degree but sometimes it’s almost distracting. Is this just a cultural difference and do Vietnamese people have no problem with it?
 Edit: thank you to all those who provided their thoughts and aren’t so sensitive they somehow took this personally lmao, I appreciate it!

I have been doing some research over the week and I'm finding myself a little overwhelmed by the options. Anyone try these out? Things you liked or didn't like? Was there anything you wished was available or anything that was you didn't need or want? It seems like the activities are based on the boat you choose. This is our first time visiting the country and I'm thrilled for the new experience. Any input would be appreciated!

 I am an Irishman in Hue for the four months, and looking for a way to practice bass as I play in a band at home. So far I haven't been able to find either an electric or an acoustic bass in Hue music shops, and I'm wondering if one of you lovely folks could point me in the right direction?
 Am I more likely to find a bass in a pawn shop? Or, if any of you are from Hue, do you have any musician friends who might have seen one for sale?
 Thanks very much!
