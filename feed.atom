        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Saturday morning we arrive in Hanoi airport. We need to transfer to our hotel in Tam Coc. Hotel has quoted us a private SUV at a cost of 1.500k. Is that reasonable? The other thing I was wondering was whether I could just book a grab from the airport to our hotel in Tam Coc or is that going to be a trip most won't take?
 ​
 Thanks.

I assume the more reputable/expensive it is like 5 star buffets, the more safe it is. But I'm daring to try 'cheaper' buffets, althought it might not be wise?

 So..is this really convincing fake meat or something more like vegetarian-fed pork? 
 Google translate didn’t clear things up much 😅

Having spent a month in North Vietnam we saw a large number of villagers and tribespeople burning all their waste, filling the air with noxious plastic fumes. Is there no waste collection service in these areas? It was so sad to see the beautiful landscape blurred by the fumes of burning waste. Why does this happen?

 I'm currently looking for a teaching job in Vietnam, i sent my application to some centers though while waiting i wanted to try applying for jobs on Facebook groups yet i felt like it could be risky. 
 Most offers there are "some locals" looking for teachers and not actual schools/centers, it seemed not legit to me but what i know is that everything works differently in Vietnam, right? 
 My question is, how legit are those offers? Is there anyone here that was hired this way through a local on facebook? 
 I would appreciate your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How much is the daily cost of living of an average single person living in the city side of Vietnam?
 Additional info:
 I do not intend to live yet to any country But I'm interested in GENERAL on how people live their lives as average people
 So a diverse answer is okay. Whenever you live in any city
 You can also give your personal range of cost of living as a person living by himself/herself
 I want to know or to be as grounded as possible on how natives live their life every day

I was wondering if i could buy some in any recommended pharmacies around District 1. I have a prescription note from my country’s psychiatrist, but will it work if i were to buy some here? I really need it for my anxiety.

 It’ll be one (25g) package only, amongst other personal stuff. It’ll be sent with dhl. It’ll be tobacco, not cigars or cigarettes.
 I read it’s allowed to import up to 250g but, it doesn’t say if that is allowed as well as a postal item. Experiences please?

 If I get serious with her, there are a few things I will want to discuss.
 One of them is her views on spanking children.
 Do most Vietnamese mothers spank?
 Growing up in the United States, it was one of those things that was usually considered private and only discussed with close friends so I honestly cannot even give an answer for how common it is in The United States (perhaps she will have a similar honest answer).
 In the United States, I would say that it about half and half (but that is only from my experience).

 I'm planning a journey for myself and husband. We're first-time travellers to Vietnam this year in late August / early September. Any tips for off the beaten track tours of 1 or 2 days on the Mekong Delta? We're used to road-trips and bumping into authentic experiences with people, a local guide in this case will probably give us insights we wouldn't otherwise have. I found something by Innoviet and Local-insider, but I still don't know if that is what we're looking for. Any tips will be much appreciated.

 Probably a long shot 
 I'm trying to find back a restaurant that I just loved when I was here the last time in 2018.
 It was right in front of the Lapis hotel on Tran Hung Dao (the avenue with all the embassies). Best banh xeo I've ever had + a bunch of other worthy dishes.
 Unexplainably now they put a fake teppanyaki fusion restaurant instead.
 I asked the girl at the entrance and she told me it might have moved to Le Duan Street - but I'm not sure if she actually understood that I was looking for that specific restaurant.
 Does anybody here know the name? 
 If not I'll take other good banh xeo suggestions too (in Hanoi)
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Viet Nam!
 Over the last year or two, I've been coming across articles about how major smartphone manufacturers have been increasingly shifting operations towards India and Viet Nam.
 As you know, China has been pretty much the "factory of the world" over the last 2 decades and her socioeconomic transformation has been astounding over the same period to say the least. Sadly, I was too young to pay attention then.
 Because of a rapidly aging population and diminishing workforce, cost of labour in China has risen exponentially. Coupled with constant, multi-front geopolitical tensions, one can understand why having operations in China faces a diminishing risk-reward ratio.
 Looking at Vietnam's Balance of Trade, I see that it's surged post-2015, around the time the protectionist Trump administration got elected - which I suppose accelerated the trend of de-coupling from China. However, the Vietnamese Dong seems to be facing a constant weakening, unlike that of an export hub. Somehow, I never see reports about how these winds are affecting regular Vietnamese citizens.
 Have you noticed a surge in manufacturing activity in Viet Nam?
 If so, how has this impacted you? 
 Has the surge been driven by MNCs setting up their own plants, or have they been subcontracting to local manufacturers?
 Also, have these factories been concentrated in particular regions and therefore limited in benefit?
 Do you think Viet Nam will experience the same breakneck growth in the next decade as China did?
 I'm excited to hear the perspectives of people living through the change!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a beach festival is going on now in Nha Trang. It's suppose to start on the 3rd of June (according to the receptionist), but they have already practicing from the 30th of May. I don't mind the noise if it's until 22:00, heck even 00:00 is fine. But it's 01:50 AM and those motherfuckers are still singing and blasting EXTREMELY LOUD music. Nobody was able to sleep. Many tourists and visitors are staying near the beach, around the area. There are many hotels. Many have toddlers that need to sleep early. Many have tours that start as early as 7am-8am in the morning.
 Tried to call the police for the noise pollution and they're useless. "Oops we can't do anything uwu" 😑. Heard a similar situation happened in Nha Trang during Tet as well. Is this only in Nha Trang specifically or does it occurred in other cities in Vietnam as well? 
 Update: The Khanh Hoa province posted this news today in the 31st of May, to remind everyone about the laws and rules.
 https://khanhhoa.gov.vn/vi/tin-tuc-noi-bat/phong-chong-vi-pham-phap-luat-trong-hoat-dong-van-hoa-the-thao-va-du-lich-3005
 Noise pollution is illegal in Vietnam and organisers have to follow the laws created by the Vietnam government. If laws are broken and not being followed, expecting some fine.
 "Kết quả, Thanh tra Bộ Văn hóa, Thể thao và Du lịch đã xử phạt vi phạm hành chính đối với 5 tổ chức, cá nhân có hành vi vi phạm với tổng số tiền xử phạt 340.000.000 đồng."

This will be my first time in South East Asia, so I’m looking for some recommendations for some less touristy places to see. I prefer nature activities, hiking, historical landmarks, temples etc over cities and urban areas. Would love to be able to do some hiking, and I’m also looking into the Ha Giang loop, but otherwise very open to suggestions.

In Da Lat some being attended with angry looks. In Nha Trang at the bus counter they even don’t want to sell me the tickets for my next destination and turning the face like I wasn’t there… at the hotel, the manager, was asking me if I taken something from the “minibar” ( literally 4 Pepsi cans ) 4 time in a row aggressively and threatening with checking the room…. Should I assume that’s the treatment that I’ll have all around the country? Of course there where people that wanted to help, but at the moment seems they are the minority… and please don’t read this as pointing fingers or in any bad way. As I said I just want to understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I´m using the "Assimil" language course book for self study to learn Vietnamese. 
 Yesterday tho, I watched a video about the usage of Vietnamese pronouns by Tieng Viet Oi, which is a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching Vietnamese, and they explained the use of the pronouns in a completely different way than my course book uses them!
 Now I feel insecure and I don´t know, if I should keep on using my course book, because I don´t want to learn this major part of the language in a wrong way! I don´t doubt, that the infos given by Tieng Viet Oi are wrong, because they´re native speakers, but maybe my book uses rules that they left out? I don´t know! Can you native speakers out there tell me, if this use of the pronouns makes any sense, or if my course book isn´t a good source?
 ​
 1.Dialogue:
 Person1, Stranger: calls other cô / Person2, stranger: calls other ông - formal setting
 2.Dialogue
 Person1, waiter: calls other bà / Person2, customer: calls other ông - restaurant order
 3.Dialogue
 Person1, knows other person, not closest friends: calls other anh / Person2, same as other: calls other chi (dot under i) - colloquial talk
 ​
 --> also the book explains the pronouns as:
 -cô: young women or women who aren´t married
 -ông: men older than 40 years
 -bà: elderly women or married women
 -anh/chi(dot): people you know and that are around your age
 ​
 (it doesn´t really consider the relationship between the speaker and the other person!)
 ​
 I´m sorry for the long post! I´d really appreciate any adivce, because I fell in love with the Vietnamese language and I just want to keep on studying! Thanks a lot and have a wonderful day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have travelled a lot all over the world together, and would do loads of activities during the day, chill on the beach, go for dinner and drinks in the evening. Obviously that has all changed, all of our plans have been cancelled so essentially starting from scratch except for the flights from Europe to Asia. It’s 3 weeks so was planning Hanoi, Chiang Mai, Koh Samui and Hoi An. Honestly my main worry is that I could be days not talking to people and be lonely. I’m introverted as is my partner but we always had each other, we are very friendly but in short conversations normally. I’m a bit lost as to what to do and half considering just not going and losing the money on the flights and maybe doing shorter trips around Europe. From being in a relationship so long it’s almost like you lose confidence alone I think and rely on the other person.

 Do you know anyone who has done this? If so, I’d love to talk with them about the challenge so I can be as prepared as possible. 
 Id like to raise money for children in need here in Vietnam. What charities do you think need the most support? 
 Does this sound like an event you would like to join or support? If so, message me. The bigger the tribe, the better the vibe.

We are aware that the school year starts around April but we would like to come sooner (Jan/Feb). We are considering volunteering through WorkAway for the first few months before trying to find jobs. We’re wondering how the visa process works: are we still only allowed to stay for 30 days on a tourist visa or is it possible to obtain an extended visa with the help of a host from WorkAway? Or will we have to do visa runs? Because we’re planning on finding jobs while in Vietnam, we’d also like to know what documents we’ll need to apply for jobs and obtain a long stay visa. We’d really appreciate any info and advise! TIA

The thing is, her family might not be too accepting of our relationship because they have super traditional views. Her family matters to her a lot, and I want to give them a good impression (or at least not a horrible one). 
 Any tips or suggestions on how I can approach this? Her family doesn't come from wealth, so I was thinking of giving a hundred or so USD dollars to each member of her close family (though I don't come from wealth either, a hundred goes a lot further over there than it does in the USA, and I thought it might be a good small amount), a couple nice gifts from America, and then of course showing respect and kindness at all times. 
 But to be honest, I'm not sure where to go from there. Is there anything I can do to make them really like me despite their traditional views? Or at least even out the scale of hate vs. like haha?

 Another thing I found unique about Vietnam is that these big signs show food names rather than business names. 
 This makes me wonder: are these signs designed and subsidised by some government agency? Was there a government program that made all food signs look similar to reach other?

 I’d like to do a special mother-in-law/son-in-law dance at the western reception, but it’s hard to find a suitable song. I want to find a song in Vietnamese for a slow dance that is appropriate coming from a son-in-law. Many songs about mothers talk about the mother raising the singer, which isn’t genuine to our relationship. I’m hoping to find a song whose lyrics work coming from me.
 Do you know of any sweet, heartfelt songs in Vietnamese that are about a mother-in-law? Or about a mother, but without focusing on how the mother raised the singer? Or a song about an amazing, strong person without any romantic subtext?
 My fiancée’s cousin helped me find Mẹ Yêu by Đỗ Phú Quí, which sounds perfect, but reading a translation of the lyrics, seems to focus too much on how the mother raised the singer. But maybe the sentiment would still work?
 Thank you for helping me make the day special for my (soon-to-be) mother-in-law!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My cousin and I are planning a trip to southeast Asia from mid-November thru early December. Most likely a November 14 departure and a December 3-4 return. We are both guys in our mid/late 20s from Los Angeles. We like nature (hiking + excursions), nature sightseeing, large cities, food, and partying.
 We were set on doing 2 weeks in Thailand but are now considering adding 4-5 days in Vietnam due to the recommendations of many family members & friends.
 Our initial plan was to do 3-5 days in Bangkok & Pattaya and then travel south for the remainder of the trip to see Phuket and Koh Phi Phi.
 So my main question is this: If we have 4-5 days, how would you recommend we spend it in Vietnam? Bangkok and Hanoi? Is it possible to truly experience these 2 major Vietnamese cities in that short of time? Should we omit one? Maybe reduce some of our time in Thailand?
 I understand there are dozens of great places we'll be missing... But I am hoping some seasoned travelers or residents of either country can give feedback/advice. It is MUCH appreciated!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Thanh Lam, Vietnam leads the world in cyber abuse to cheat and violate the law.
 At the Multi-Channel Management Networking Workshop on the morning of May 27 in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Nguyen Thanh Lam said:
 "For every 100 dong earned from cheating on YouTube, there are 55 dong of Vietnamese users. We are at the top of the list for copyright infringement. There is a football livestream channel that violates copyright like Xoi Lac TV. There is a channel that buys Japanese porn, cuts it into many short clips, and then packs it and sells it to the American audience."
 Lam said the country in second place in the ranking accounts for only 5% of fraudulent income, one-tenth of Vietnam. Last week, Apple also announced to remove more than 8,000 infringing applications originating in Vietnam, many of which are content creation applications.
 The deputy minister said that this is a sad record, exposing the fact that besides positive content, many creators still do business and make money regardless. Part of the responsibility lies with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook when they can't control the content and users on the platform. Advertisers also have a responsibility to still spend money on dirty content.
 "The state does not prevent businesses from wanting to advertise in cyberspace, but it is impossible for a money to flow into malicious content that businesses still see as normal," Mr. Lam said.

 We are 3 girls planning a quick getaway trip to Hanoi and Cat Ba island from 28th September-2nd October. Unfortunately we are short on time and so we have planned this itinerary:
 ​
 - Land in Hanoi on 28th Morning, leave directly for Cat Ba, stay in a resort/hotel
 - Leave Cat Ba on 30th Morning, come back to Hanoi, get an AirBnB in/near Old Quarter
 - Checkout on 2nd morning and take the evening flight back to our country
 ​
 I read alot of posts on travelling to Hanoi/Vietnam and I am honestly with too much information and figured it would be better to ask here. Please help me out!
  
Is Cat Ba Island worth it? We wanted to avoid the crowd in Ha Long Bay, but stay near the sea and relax. 
 Any suggestions for Cat Ba, like places to eat/ things to do/ places to stay?
 Best way to travel from Hanoi to Cat Ba and back?
 For Hanoi, we have Egg Coffee, Bahn Mi (and a lot more food items) and Beer Street on our list already, but any hidden/hole in the wall places that are away from commercial tourism would be great to know. Very open to trying authentic vietnamese food and drinks!! 
 Any suggestions for a reputable spa experience in Cat Ba or Hanoi are most welcome
 Any suggestions for where to go for a party in Hanoi? We will be there during the weekend
  
Thank you for taking the time out to read this and so sorry if its a long post!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many of you, I am increasingly concerned by the hate and hostility that I see every day in this beautiful community, especially between Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans. 😔 
 It is my firm believe that in our time and age, nothing is more important than mutual respect and understanding. So, in this spirit, I propose a new Vietnamese flag that symbolizes the indestructible friendship between the North and South; a new flag free of bad connotations; a flag that combines the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam. 
 As we strive to foster stronger connections between Vietnamese wherever they may reside or what they believe, it is essential to have a symbol that represents our shared values of friendship and understanding; representing multiculturalism, love, diversity, respect and mutual understanding 🤝🌍

 This proposed flag aims to honor Vietnam's rich cultural heritage and traditions (blue) and emphasizes the significance of unity and cooperation (red). The Golden Star represents the everlasting bond between Vietnam's people and their striving for greatness and prosperity for all Vietnamese people, regardless of their geographical location or political stances.
 With my loving heart, I invite every one of you to print this flag out, show it to your parents and especially grandparents and display it proudly in your windows. Let's propagate the message of love and friendship. Because only as an undivided ONE we can overcome the hate that has tormented this beautiful land for far too long ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Seems like you can travel the entire Vietnam for that time if you touch and go however it's my first time there and I don't want to stress myself out by taking a loooooong train or bus ride (I get motion sickness). The flight is already booked so we have to start and end at hcmc no matter what. 
 What do you recommend? Should I 
  
Take it easy and stay entire week in HCMC and go for day trips to cu chi and mekong delta etc
 
Travel to danang/hoi an via plane/train. Will it be too tiring to go there and back to hcmc in 7 days?
 
Spend the time in South Vietnam, going furthest to muine/nha trang?
 
 Or anything in between? 
 Also, are the roads super difficult to cross? I have huge anxiety about this and when I cross the road usually use traffic lights so I'm super unconfident.
 Also, I'm going in august.. read that it's the rainy season. Should I give up on seeing the beach entirely?

 Just curious what my options are for attempting to do this with my fiancé comfortably able to sit on the back (ideally able to strap a backpack to the back as well).
 5 years ago I drove from Hanoi to Saigon via motorbike (without a doubt the greatest travel experience of my life).
 But now I am coming back for a long honeymoon and what to do the Ha Giang Loop which I sadly missed last time around.
 I own a 1000cc motorcycle back home, and have obviously quite a bit of experience driving in Vietnam in previous trips. However, with a second person attached to the back this gets a bit trickier.
 I want something that will comfortable seat both of us for long stints of the drive, and ideally I want to rent this time and not purchase. What do you guys recommend?

My PC can detect that something is connected but when I try to open it, it doesn’t work. I’ve tried different ways but I’m sure it’s physical damage. Unfortunately, all the pictures of my father who passed away last year are on that SSD (except for some on Facebook). Do you have any recommendations for data recovery services in Hanoi? I will be there next week and I’m hoping to find something there. Cam on guys

 I am planning a 16 days trip to North and Central Vietnam this December. Flying into Hanoi and out from Da Nang. 
 I have shortlisted these places.
 Hanoi,
 Ha Long Bay,
 Sapa,
 Ninh Binh,
 Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park,
 Hue,
 Hoi An
 Da Nang.
 16 days is definately too short to visit them all yea? Which one should I miss if so.
 I love nature, history and culture but am also a budget traveler.
 Sorry if I posted at the wrong subreddit.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Vietnam has been making strides in the world of technology and innovation. With the rise of start-ups and the increasing number of high-tech companies moving their branch offices to Vietnam, is there a possibility that Vietnam, this Southeast Asian nation, could become the next start-up nation in Asia?
 The shift from China to Vietnam has been noticeable, with companies such as Samsung, LG, and Intel all establishing a strong presence in Vietnam. This trend is not limited to just large corporations, as start-ups are also finding success in Vietnam's growing tech scene.
 One reason for Vietnam's appeal is its young and highly educated population. According to the World Bank, nearly 60% of Vietnam's population is under the age of 35, and the country boasts a literacy rate of over 95%. This has created a strong talent pool for tech companies to draw from.
 Another factor contributing to Vietnam's potential as a start-up nation is its favorable business environment. The Vietnamese government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurship. The country has also made significant improvements in infrastructure, including expanding its internet connectivity and investing in new technology parks.
 However, there are still challenges that Vietnam must overcome in order to fully realize its potential as a start-up nation. One major hurdle is the lack of venture capital funding available for start-ups. While the government has taken steps to address this issue, more needs to be done in order to attract investment and support the growth of new businesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I am making plans to visit Vietnam for the first time, landing in Hanoi and planning to spend around a month here. I would love to visit HCMC and do the hiang loop also.
 My concern is with the street dogs that I have seen online in the SEA countries especially in Thailand and I was wondering what the reality of the situation is in Vietnam.
 I am at the level where if I see a dog I will cross the road or go the other way.
 I’ve heard that pretending to pick up a rock and holding a stick / umbrella is good defence.
 Is it realistic for me to have a good time in Vietnam (especially if most my time will be on group tours and city) with the dog population?
 Mainly my fear is with dogs off lead and more so feral/wild/street dogs in packs.
 Thank you very much and apologies for the errors question, I know that dog phobia is not common and that most people love dogs - trust me I do too but I cannot lie about the reality that I fear dogs.

 Now, as a first time traveler to vietnam, I will have never taken one of the buses there. Is a flight booked for 13:05 cutting it to close considering the possibility of delays? Would 14:00 be a safer bet?

 From what I've seen the weather seems to be more bearable than in Hanoi but I'm not quite sure in how far it would allow me to do sightseeing and stuff throughout the day.
 So I was wondering if someone could tell me about the personal experiences in Saigon around this time of year. Do tourists usually visit there in summer? Do public buildings, restaurants and trains have AC? Do locals spend time outside during the day or do they usually try to stay inside?
 Pretty much what I wanna know is if I'll be able to have a good time despite the warm weather and rain. I live in Europe and the climate here is quite different from SE Asia, so apologies if some of my questions come across as naive or uneducated. 
 Either way, I know there's no definitive answer to this, but any helpful advice is much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So there a Vietnamese channel that buy youtube ad service to promote recently and one of it famous video is about the YouTubers feed a cat that got chained. As many people said it kinda disturbing bc things like that in their country consider as animal abuse immediately but in VietNam it a dangerous environment in the city if you let your cat roam outside. Also about the physical interact that look like slap actually is a pat but Im not sure bc it a child hit💀. Cats can easily accident unalived by many reasons in my country but I not support thing like that, it just most necessary still depend on the owner and the situation.

 Does anyone know where I might find contact lens solution - anywhere in Ha Giang or Cao Bang?
 I am traveling via motorbike and need to find this ASAP as I’ve almost run out! I assumed pharmacies would carry it but that appears to be incorrect. 
 Is there a glasses shop/optometrist in any of the towns on the loop (I’m in Dong Van now), Ha Giang town, or in Cao Bang town maybe?? Google maps doesn’t show anything.. 
 Would be a stupid reason to cut my trip short! 😫

 Just wondering what was going on with that?
 PS. He threw the hat in front of the meter and I could still see the fare in the reflection of the windshield. It started off at 10k and rose very slowly. Then randomly jumped to 500k, 1 million before reaching 2 million by the end. The fare ended up being 41k on grab.

 I think this word means "horny dog" or something about being horny. However when I Google translate it says that it means thieves.
 Could someone confirm to me that "Dâm tặc" can mean horny? I'm not 100% sure if this is the word she use to call me, I just Googled how I think it was spelled and it came up.

 I have been living in Can Tho since 2011. The city once was really nice, but lately I feel unwelcome and uncomforable here. What I experienced this morning confirms my feelings the more.
 I work self-employed, so I can manage my time. Every morning I take a walk (actually, I want to jog, but the heat...). So I am walking down Nguyen Viet Hong, turn then into a small hem and come out at Le Lai. From there I need to cross the Pham Van Tri and enter the park (Luu Huu Phuoc). Easy. I've been doing it for a long time.
 This morning, when I approached the corner Le Lai/Pham Van Tri, a young Vietnamese, apparently agitated, was standing there. He threw with things onto the cars and motorbikes. I must have looked bewildered. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked part-time at a hotel for a few months (as a second job so that I could make a little extra money).
 My co-worker (22 year-old Vietnamese woman who recently graduated from College) came up to me and gave me a $10 Starbucks card on my last day of work.
 I was surprised as her and I got along well when we worked together (but we rarely saw each other/rarely worked together as it is a big hotel).
 I am a 40-year old man and have had many jobs and this is the first time that a co-worker has done this. I think it is very nice.
 Her and I have contact on Linkedin.
 I don't mean to "keep score", but there is something nice that I would like to do for her. Suggestions?
 As an aside: At work I was busy and I never paid much attention to her. In looking back she was very hard working and kind. I have travelled to Japan, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Laos, South Korea, Malaysia and Kong Kong but for some reason I overlooked Vietnam. She got me thinking of Vietnam and I have since developed an interest in travelling there and have read many good things about Vietnamese women.
 Obviously I am not going to be in a relationship with her (not likely with any Vietnamese American for that matter: even in big/diverse cities the Vietnamese are likely less than 1% of the population and moving to Vietnam is not an option).
 Still nice to know that such people exist however.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have family members in Vietnam that I'd like to buy gifts for. However, I don't have any Vietnamese bank accounts (all my bank accounts/credit cards are registered abroad). I've tried Shopee, but they rejected all of my cards (Visa and Mastercard).
 Are there other platforms (that operate/are based in Vietnam) that take international-based credit cards? I'm open to opening a bank account with international banks like HSBC if that helps. As mentioned in the title, I also have CCND and can open a Vietnamese-based bank account, but I'm not too sure how the process works.

 I'm thinking about taking the ~12 days guided motorcycle trip to Hanoi then flying back, that sounds simply amazing. But good alternatives would be spending some more time in the city and taking my time in the south instead. I love a good hike or some local culture and would hate to rush things.
 What would be your thoughts on how best to spend the time?

 I'm (33) Australian my wife (30) is Vietnamese lived here since 18 years old. We've been married for 6.5 years together for 10. 
 I've been to Vietnam many times and I love it, when we touch down in Saigon I start getting an almost 'coming home' vibe. My Viet language skills are actually not too bad, so I can get around by myself, order my own food, shopping, basic conversation. 
 Anyway, my in laws are coming here for a visit, it's winter so doing some of the really great Australian outdoor type activities, so we are gonna take them out for dinners, some shows etc. We have planned for a weekend away in a cottage in the countryside with some of my family. Now my in laws speak next to zero english, and my family speak no Viet. 
 I'm just wondering if anyone might have some suggestions for some good activities we could enjoy together without having to rely to heavily on my wife to translate constantly. Like some games or activities or board games etc. We can do while enjoying a couple of beers by the fireplace. Hopefully someone out there has some suggestions, I just want them to feel like they're participating with us rather than just observers.
 Thanks ☺️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just landed at in HCMC. Wanted to share some things I saw for foreigners in terms of how to get into town with zero stress taking a grab.
 1) Go through customs, Exit international terminal. Look for the green umbrella tents across the street. 100 yards max. cant miss them. 5-6 large green umbrellas. I dont ever remember seeing these before. 
 2) open grab and use the green umbrella area as your pick up spot.
 it should cost you 125k dong to get into D1. Grab will add 15k for the airport toll. Total bill should be about 140k + any surge. The driver pays the toll.
 Waiting for grab at 6am = 10 mins
 ride to D1 took 15-20 mins.
 Cost was 140k dong which is like 7 bux. and best was ZERO stress of being ripped. had 3-4 taxi guys approach and follow me to grab area.

 I was wanting to fly somewhere fun and interesting this winter for vacation and I was interested in visiting Vietnam for it's connection to Cold War history even after the Vietnam War.
 However, when looking at tickets for Vietnam through Expedia, I noticed that they aren't the cheapest.
 Being a college student on a budget, I was kind of curious if anyone here has a preferred airline they fly with when it comes to Vietnam whether it is to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City?
 Thanks in advance everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I am an American and am planning on visiting Viet Nam this December. I want to preface this by saying I undestand that eating dog meat is a cultural practice and that it is not too different from pigs and chickens (I am vegan and not here to judge). However, I would like to know how visible this trade is when visiting and how I could avoid seeing it. For reference, I will be going from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi and will be visiting other places along the way like Hoi An, Hue, and Phong Nha. Any advice and experiences would be appreciated. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foodie friend asked me to help ask around...
 La Maison 1888 is the French fine dining restaurant of Intercontinental Hotel Da Nang. This hotel is a 30 minute car ride away from the main beach because it is on the far end of the coast, and it does not allow Grab pickups out of the hotel. The restaurant is built into an old villa on a cliff, overlooking the water, and is very beautiful. They emphasize that they have the only 3 Michelin star French chef working there, and claim to be the #1 food destination in Vietnam. (Tasting menu is VND4-5M.)
 The advertising feels scammy because there is no such thing as a Michelin star chef. They claim the chef helped design the menu and he runs a 3 Michelin star restaurant in Paris, which is not the same thing and he is not in the Da Nang restaurant. Vietnam will only get Michelin rated retaurants in 2023, and only in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. There are very few blog reviews about the restaurant, and their TripAdvisor and Google Maps reviews do not imply that this is a legendary must try before you die place.
 Can Vietnam foodies comment?

I’ve been trekking round Viet Nam for about a week-and-a-half now, and I noticed a lot of people wearing hoodies and all to cover every bit of their body in public and on scooters when it’s 35C+ out. Is there any particular reason for that? I’m sweating myself into oblivion so I can’t imagine walking around in full winter clothing 🥵

 For the most part I am able to drive normally on the road but I find it so hard park in small narrow parking spaces, sometimes there are security men help me sometimes there are not, and in those times when there is no one to help, I have fallen 3 times due to sudden brake when the gas was still on (the place so narrow I was afraid I’m gonna hit objects so I hit brake too sudden) And now I am starting to feel a bit fearful of driving :(

 First of all I spent 6 weeks in Vietnam and absolutely loved it the people are emazing, countryside beautiful as well as amazing food. I would love to revisit and go to the parts I didn't have time to see. 
 Im posting on here because I'm looking for a friend I met on a night out in Hanoi on the 4th May called Patrick who is Swedish. I'm female from the UK, we had a great time when we met but we didn't get chance to exchange any contact details. I think he's still in Vietnam in HCMC, I'm now not. If you're on here hit me up, it would be nice to see what you are up to. Absolute long shot and very unlikely they are on here (I probably won't ever find him.) 
 (I'm not sure if this is allowed on here and I will delete if not. Before I get any hate I understand that there are hundreds and thousands of tourists in Vietnam. Just thought I'd see if I could reconnect)

 I'm an English teacher for adults in HCMC and trying to find useful/interesting topics for my students. :
 I asked some Vietnamese friends and one mentioned the pronunciation of "calendar and lavender" and the use of "ish" (ie 'the party starts at ten-ish'). I'm looking for more examples.

 Me: Born in late 1980s
 We immigrated to the USA in the mid 1990s and all became US citizens over the next 10-20 years. I'm trying to resolve a USA pension related issue for my parents and it has been a nightmare because they didn't keep copies of the forms that I need. Pretty much the only significant documentation I've gotten from them is my refugee card and my Certificate of Citizenship.
 I'm tried pretty much everything I can think of to prove their marriage status but unfortunately:
 1) They never owned property
 2) They don't have a copy of their last joint tax filing (which would be 2015 or 2016). I'm currently trying to track down where they filed their taxes to see if I can get a copy, I also plan to contact the IRS.
 3) Social Security doesn't have them listed as each other's spouses even though they did provide me with a form that said my dad would translate for his wife, which is my mom (WHAT THE FUCK)

 They've said I can do my internship whenever I want, so I can decide when I travel. I don't know if it's best to travel in June 12-30 and then do my internship, or in July (after my internship)..or if there will be any difference at all 
 was hoping I'd be able to hike in sa pa and phong nha. I know it's rainy season,, but I am not sure if this means absolutely no hiking or nature ever, or if it'll just vary day by day ?
 :) I'm excited to live in HCMC
 I'm super keen to spend some time in jungles too--i wanted to do this tour, https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-ba-deep-jungle-expedition/ but it's 2 grand ... Any tips ? If I find a tent and someone cool to come with me, ? 
 Would really appreciate Any advice/comments you have, and if you have any special places to recommend id be very very grateful :)
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something about malls/supermarkets in Vietnam that makes me feel like it's more interesting and luxurious. In the US they just feel mainstream and "I go there just to buy stuff" kind of feeling. In Vietnam going to a supermarket is like being on a fun trip. For example a trip to Coop Mart was a lot more fascinating than walking around in Walmart. Maybe because I was young and poor so memories were more fond?
 ** Ok so I'm probably wrong about the malls. But what about the supermarkets? Is it fair to compare Walmart, Target and Costco to Coop Mart and Lotte Mart?

Mình sợ xe to lắm, do mình nhiều lần đi trong tỉnh bị xe khách với container ép xíu rơi xuống ruộng rồi (đi trong sg thì chưa gặp khó khăn vì có tách làn container và xe máy rồi). Nên mình muốn hỏi đường nào đi an toàn và ít gặp xe to nhất. Mình nên đi khung giờ nào thì ít xe to nhất. Mình cũng không biết sửa xe, vậy trong trường hợp xe hư thì mình nên làm gì. Mọi người giải đáp giúp mình nha 😁.

I came here with a YouTuber who was doing a small meet and greet with some of his followers with the intention of scouting out new exotic fruits at markets and orchards and we ended up trying over 75 varieties of fruits, most of which I had never had before in the USA. 
 This was my first time ever leaving the USA and to be honest, I didn’t know too much about Vietnam before taking the trip. I was really just looking forward to leaving the USA and experiencing a new spot on the globe, and the opportunity to go to VN just landed in my lap. I have to say, I was blown away by your country.

But I can’t help but think it’s a bit extreme here.

I was studying using pimsleur for learning Portuguese which I have a review here. I was studying that for 6 months and I think it helped me in learning vietnamese and made it quite a breeze. Listening to the audio, while writing down everything really helps for my learning and it's well paced. I recommend pimsleur for any viet kieus that never got around to learning vietnamese.

Where I’m from there’s lots of people who are also of Vietnamese descent, but I’ve noticed that around 20-40% of these people are also mixed with Chinese. Is it the same in Vietnam? I know that China and Vietnam use to be on bad terms (might still be?) yet VietChinese people are so prevalent.

 Curious what the experience is like in Vietnam during Tết? To me it probably would be something cool and new since I never got to see it before.. but to my family over there they probably experienced it too many times already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When in Thailand I got full body massages once a week. No happy endings, and never had it on my list of things to try. I just wanted to relax my muscles from full days of walking, and only went to places that had signs saying "no sex".
 Landed in Hanoi a few days ago and went for a full body Vietnamese massage at a parlor where the women were dressed up in everyday clothing. So I thought this massage was gonna be like in Thailand, and solely for muscle relaxation and recovery from walking.
 I turn on my back and massage was good, then all of a sudden I start to notice the lady spending a lot of time in my groin region. I thought i may have felt really tight there, so maybe she was working out some knots..
 I was wrong, I was getting aroused, and she knew as well. Then tells me she'll give me a good massage and motions for a "special" type of massage..
 There was NO intentions of me getting one, and I thought I was just getting a regular massage as I always have in Thailand.
 Anyone else have this happen?? It was pretty funny looking back at it, and still no "special massages" since being in Asia.

 Does this seem like the right mix, or should I reallocate my time at all? Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Viet boyfriend and I (South Korean girl) have dated for a year. We’re at the same age (2000 kids). We studied abroad at the same uni in Canada. Last year, my parents came to Canada to attend my convocation. I introduced him to my parents, and they're really impressed with him bc of his family background, handsome face, height, education and graduation job (these things are very important in Korean culture), 
 Next month, he and I will travel to Vietnam for summer vacation and visit his parents in Hanoi. I wanna make them impressed just like he did on my mom and dad. 
 What can I do to impress his parents?Especially when I come to his family house, and we do not speak the same language. 
 Do old Viet people judge girls by their look, family background like Korean do? I’m quite confident but I don’t look like Viet girls.
 My Viet female friend say Hanoi parents are extremely conservative. Is that true?
 What gifts should I give to them? I have some high-end korean skincare products for his mom, but have no idea for his dad.
 Update: thank you guys for great suggestions. As I know from my Viet female friend, his parents are well off and live in a big mansion in Hanoi. That could mean they’re open minded like you guys commented. I’m confident in answering all questions regarding family background, I know rich Asian people care about these things. My dad also asked him about his dad’s job when we had dinner in Toronto. My boy has a brother who has a wife working as IELTS teacher. Both of them can speak English, so luckily I have more people to talk without translation and support me. So excited to come to 🇻🇳🇻🇳 for the first time

I am fine with fish, lobster, crab, and shrimp. I'm not deathly allergic - I just get a gastrointestinal reaction but that would ruin a day or two of the trip! What is the best way to make sure my food will not have mollusks in it? I'd like to have some seafood. What things should I avoid and what should I say to someone to ask if the dish has mollusks in it? Thank you

 so as advice to all traveling to hcm airport, only book taxi from companies and issues receipt, but now a days vinasun and malinh counters or liason taxi handlers started to behave more like gangsters, that's why i started using taxi companies before the exit, looks like im running out of options, except to book grab or gojek

A few folks I met along the way had warned me about Hanoi. I had bought some donuts for 50k. I did not have any small change so I gave her 500k and asked for 450k back. She pretend to gave me an extra donut and move away so I asked for my change. She brought out her purse and said this was what I gave her (50k). I had to wait for another order from another vendor and by the time I went back to her, she had already disappeared! Just be careful and use small changes especially with street vendors!

 I’ve been pulled over a few times by the CSGT and am wondering if there’s a polite way in Vietnamese to do the same thing.

 This past week I started getting diarrhea. Not in the ill, going multiple times a day way. But every morning I wake up a bit earlier than usual with the urge to go. And my stool is like water.
 Normal appetite, no cramps, no nausea, nothing. I’m vegetarian, so haven’t eaten any weird meats.
 The first night it started was after I did a caving tour. We used our guide’s water filter straw but that was it. Also, seems a bit fast for it to be related to that? Either way, I don’t know. Just a thought. 
 Otherwise I feel fine! Great energy. It’s just that my usual daily bowel movement is watery diarrhea.
 Suggestions?

 I’m staying in HN for the next 2 months and want to connect with the Start Up and Digital Nomad community here. Do you have any recommendations where to meet people ? What platform do people here use to connect and network ? Where should I look for events or gatherings ? I’m thinking about visiting some co-working spaces, joining meetup.com events and search for FB-groups. I’m thankful for any info or tip.
 Have a great day people !

 I grew up on a farm in the midwest of the US, and I love animals. I actually think cows and pigs are just as smart and loving, if not more, than dogs, so I realized that I don't really have an issue eating dogs due to abuse because cows/pigs in the US are brutalized far more than dogs in vietnam (look up factory farming practices in the US if you don't believe me, it is truly an abomination).
 However, I'd like to "kill two birds with one stone", if you will. Can anyone recommend me a high quality restaurant (don't want to eat some street dog/cat or something) that serves both dog and cat? I would like to try both, but I don't want to go to two separate establishments to try.

 However, on Voz, I've seen some Vietnamese incorporate history into their viewpoint. Some people believe that modern Japanese people are "disgusting" because they are descended from bad people.
 I'm curious if any of the Vietnamese people here have similar thoughts. For example, should we be cautious around a Japanese person simply because they are Japanese?
 I don't ask this question just because. I'm about to start working for a Japanese company in Vietnam, and I don't want anything like this to get in my way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, thinking of purchasing a vehicle, and those mini hatchbacks you see all over seem to be what I'm looking for. Perfect for getting in and out of my small street and driveway. 
 The VinFast Fadil, after some initial research, seems like a solid option. It's both cheaper in VN and seemingly has more features than the competitors like the Toyota Wigo, Honda Brio, or Chevrolet Spark...
 However, I haven't been able to find any decent English reviews of the car online. Can anyone who has owned one share their experiences? Are they a reliable car? Worth the 380 million or so to purchase one?

 Does anyone have any suggestions for some not-for-profit organisations that might benefit from our tourism / donations / contributions? 
 For example, when I visited Bolivia some years ago I joined a not-for-profit tour group that took us on hikes to see the mountains, and the money we spent was used to benefit the local communities. 
 Thanks!

My partner and I are staying in Ninh Binh want to rent a motorbike to see Tam Coc while we’re here as I feel it would be a waste not to. We’re just super nervous about renting a motorbike/scooter. I’m used to mopeds a little and we rented one earlier in our trip on Langkawi in Malaysia. But Vietnam traffic is something else lol, I feel confident enough to do it but wondering what other people’s experiences driving Ninh Binh to Tam Coc is? Outside the town how safe are the roads? Thank u in advance and if there’s anything we should see while I’m Tam Coc any recommendations would be welcome!

 There are a few things I will stay away from, mostly bugs/spiders/roaches, etc, but I've eaten crickets and scorpions.
 I am a bit torn because I researched that you can find dog in Vietnam and that it's actually pretty common. I'm debating on whether or not I should try it. Is it safe to eat? Like are these dogs bred to be eaten or are they diseased street animals that are caught and cooked?
 By the way, while I love dogs, I find it somewhat hypocritical that people will turn a blind eye to the atrocious factory farming practices deployed on cows and pigs, while judging the shit out of people who eat dog. As someone who grew up on a farm, I can tell you that both cows and pigs are just as intelligent, if not more, than most dogs. Cows will actually get to know you and love you, just like a dog, so please let's not judge people who eat dogs when America brutalizes and tortures cows.

My honeymoon is in January, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to go to Vietnam especially with good weather conditions during that time of year. However, I haven’t traveled internationally in over a decade so I’m nervous for the language barrier and ideally I’d want to visit multiple cities but this seems complicated in Vietnam. I also want to see Da Nang’s beach. Is seeing Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and Long Xuyen possible in a two week trip? I’ve been told by people to “hire a driver” but Ho Chi Minh and Long Xuyen are 3 hours apart, so I’m not sure if this is doable. I was thinking of flying of Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh, but I’m not sure how that would be either. Any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated!

Started off as a commuting purpose but soon turned into a hobby/addiction cause of how fun I can get on these pevs especially freely going around the city.
 Id love to take my EUC back to Vietnam but arent too sure about the laws and regulation behind these things, id assume they would be on the same level as those electric moped that the high school kids used to ride on but i can be wrong. Tried doing some research on it but not a lot of results came up. I know these arent technically legal but are they like super restricted or is it like "you are technically not supposed to ride them but I dont care enough" kinda thing. Would love to hear what you have in mind.
 Thanks!

 I'm trying to research things about the country, including what to do and what NOT to do, but I was wondering if anyone could throw a few tips my way, mostly to help me avoid getting scammed.
 I have travelled to a few asian countries- Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and China (Major cities only). Is Vietnam/Hanoi similar to any of those places?
 I guess my questions would be (sorry for the ignorance, usually I research a place I go to for weeks, but I don't really have time for this trip.
 1) Is street food safe to eat? Water at restaurants? Do you ask for "no ice" due to bacteria issues?
 2) What is the best way to get around? Uber? Taxi? etc
 3) Any recommendations on what to do?
 4) Shopping tips? I would like to buy some knives and sandals and cool collectables. I hear knives are very cheap and well made in Vietnam.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 My question is about obtaining my background check for Vietnam. When selecting the purpose of the check, am I supposed to select “for personal review” or “living abroad/visa requirement”? I’m using accurate biometrics, and the only advice I could find is for Korea, which may have different requirements than Vietnam. 
 I have seen that when teaching in Korea, they tell you to select personal review. However that leaves a notice on the paper that states “not valid for use abroad” or something along these terms. However the hagwons seem to accept it anyway, and I’m not sure if that’s the same as Vietnam. 
 Has anyone here used Accurate Biometrics before, and which option did you select before submitting your request? 
 In the second to last drop down box on the demographics page, did you select for personal review, or the “visa requirement/living abroad” option? I want to make sure I check the correct box during the process to ensure I get the proper results needed.

While I have been enjoying my time here, I have Ibeen wondering if the extreme heat and heavy air pollution has been normal in the recent days/weeks. 
 Currently in Hue and from my googling it seems that it is one of the most polluted cities at the moment. Is this business as usual or do people here consider it unusually bad?
 Still, food is great, people are wonderful and life is good!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So yesterday i met a couple of guys from my country and we drank beer and had a good time on the party street. Next thing i know is that im sitting on a random guys scooter on the way to his apartment, i dont remember his face, i dont remember him taking my phone at all. What i remember is just being very upset about losing my phone but still remained relatively calm. In a proper manner, i asked a guy in a green uniform who was nearby when it happend (i think) and it just felt like he was part of it all. 
 The guy has withdrawn more than $600 (the card was in the phonecase", do you think its possible to get this back because i am already on a tight budget... Maybe need to make police report for that and im probably leaving tomorrow. Whats even more scary is how he knew my pin-code. Something that sucks too is that all my pictures are gone. This was a big shit storm and it has completely ruined my mood and now i probably cant continue traveling as long as I planed.
 Has anyone been in this situation before? I would gladly take all tips from you guys.

 Day 1: Arrive in Da Nang + head to Hoi An 
 Day 2: Explore Hoi An 
 Day 3: Hoi An + head to Da Nang at night/ sleep 
 Day 4: Morning flight from Da Nang > Hanoi + explore Hanoi
 Day 5: Day trip to Halong Bay 
 Day 6: Explore Hanoi 
 Day 7: Explore Hanoi + fly back 
 I omitted Hue just because of the distance from Da Nang & really want to see the lanterns + tailor shops in Hoi An, but I am also wondering if this schedule is too packed. In between squeezing in two regions of Vietnam vs staying in Hanoi the entire trip (and maybe adding in additional day trips) / saving Hoi An + Hue for a later time, which would you all suggest? 
 Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 My 2 friends and I are headed to Vietnam from October 9th to 18th. We are wanting to spend 2 nights out of the city hiking or at a beach town. We would prefer that the drive from the city to 2 night stay location is about 3 hours or so. Then, 3 days in the city indulging in food/drinks, day activities, etc. 
  
Should we go to Hanoi or HCMC?
 I did a little research and saw that it was a bit colder and slightly rainy. Kind of like winter. I'm curious about what locals say the weather is like there during the middle of October.
 For Hanoi and HCMC what are the best hikes/towns/beach areas to spend 2 nights at?
  
Any other recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I live on the coast so I'm constantly exposed to harsh sunlight. I've noticed that alot of Vietnamese women aren't tanned at all, for example their hands and face are the same color and not different skin tones like i have. I'm pretty light skinned but just got super tanned cuz i was out today. Any tips on how yall avoid getting tanned?

 hello everyone! this is my first post here, but I’d really like to get some feedback on this as i just had this idea pop into my head this morning. 
 so my fiancé is vietnamese and he’s back in vietnam visiting family after having moved away about 13 years ago. he’s from saigon. 
 i’ve been trying to get him to teach me vietnamese but he hasn’t been very good at it 🤣 i’m very familiar with self studying languages as i’ve been studying mandarin for about 12 years now, so i’m more than willing to get a few resources to learn on my own and just ask him questions when i have any. 
 any and all recommendations would be greatly appreciated! specific book/show/movie/etc recommendations preferred since my fiancé doesn’t really know what to look for since he’s not familiar with modern learning resources available in Vietnam.

There are many different kind of banana plants and I especially like the one being grown here in Vietnam so I'd really like to take one home. I can't get one like this in my home country so this is the only way. From what I know I have to carry a phytosanitary certificate for this. Now, I have a couple of questions:
 1.) what exactly is a banana plant called in vietnamese and in what kind of shop can I buy one? Most garden shops don't sell those. They grow everywhere but I can't just steal one, right?
 2.) for phytosanitary certificate I found this site. I'm at a hotel in Hanoi so I could just drive there. My main concerns are: Are 7 days enough time? Do I need a real adress in Vietnam? What would it cost?

 I have a license to ride a motorcycle and have the right international license for Vietnam. Is this still illegal?
 Thanks. Any help is greatly appreciated.

 Does anyone has experience with ILA and VUS I would definitely appreciate any previous experiences as my current advisor for the job is not responding back at all, and none of my colleagues can reach her either to further process me. I’m thinking I will go on their website and reapply, also apply to VUS. Any advice and experience stories is much appreciated.
 I really would like to know about the work cultures, salary differences (I’ve seen other posts and I believe they’re around the same) and how reliable both are in terms of getting people processed effectively without issues.

 He beckons me to follow him and we walk past the taxi ranks to the car park. I assumed he was just parked up having a ciggy so dont think much of it. Theres a car half pulled into a bay that he walks upto and knocks on the window. Weird but I thought maybe hes passing the job onto his friend.

We were staying near Binh Thanh market and there were a bunch of jewellery shops there. Strangely enough, a couple of them, I think those were gold & diamond stores, did not allow us to enter and were very rude. In one such outlet (picture attached), the guard blocked our way, and just kept saying "No". Not sure if they were just prejudiced against us (Indians) or was it something else. Racism is something I have never observed in oriental countries.

 I am about 1/3rd the way through the Duolingo course on day 120. I obviously don't know much, but im starting to be able to pull out and hear random peices of vocabulary if I watch the news or something. 
 Id like to start immersing myself in the music now, any and all suggestions will be listened too. ❤️ Ty kindly.
 Edit: skimmed and listened to most, đen vâu so far is my favourite. Thanks so much everyone.

He abuses them and even gave one permanent brain damage. Hes even bragging online how much money he makes in a week but lies to his followers and begs for money everyday. He has a youtube of 691k followers, a store online, swimwear store, patreon, paypal and youtube money not to mention tictok. @tiutac is his name, if you can report him on youtube that would be great too. I would be willing to pay you and for your ride to the police station and if the police wont act i have cash i can pay, but i dont want to arrest him corruptly. I have evidence of all of his abuse and scams. He even tried to scam people out of their life savings 50k usd for a website that never existed.

I knew what I was getting into when I started but they are somehow worse than even I expected. Regardless most teachers have left the company and they are searching for American teachers specifically. On paper they offer a pretty good contract but they don’t fulfill any of those commitments. I know there’s probably a million other posts like this but I just wanted to bring it home again that Apax Leaders should be avoided altogether unless you enjoy working for free.

However, does anyone have any more details on this? I mean, this makes less sense than in, for instance, Azerbaijan, which was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, therefore was under Soviet control.
 Did, by any chance, Vietnam simply copy their signs from the Soviets/Russia, taking their obvious friendly relations into account?

I know many people visit Vietnam for vacation or to take some time off, as hill stations in India have become increasingly expensive and overcrowded. I talked with a few friends, and they had such a great time there visiting and talking with you folks, so really, thank you for your hospitality
 I would love to know did you have people met any Indian tourists here and what were your general impressions of us.

I know there's direct flights to Da Nang from Korea but surely Korea is nice enough to just vacation at home instead? Is Vietnamese cuisine is incredibly popular with Koreans or is it the exchange rate? Are there a lot of Korean companies in Vietnam nowadays (meaning they aren't actually tourists but they live & work here)? Genuinely curious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have this annoying pet peeve when it comes to parking my motorbike, whether it is in front of a restaurant or in some motorbike parking that when I come back I always find my bike: 1) moved somewhere else and mashed between other motorbikes, 2) the dude is sitting on my motorbike and smoking a cigarette, 3) both 1 and 2. I’ve been living here for about 5 years now and it still bothers me til this day. If I frequent a place then I usually build a relationship with the guy and give him a little extra coffee money to leave my bike where it is and to not do the things I stated above so it works out. But, when it’s a new place that I barely go to I usually don’t have that luxury and I become quite annoyed by this experience every time. I have a little bit of OCD and care about the condition of my motorbike and would like to keep it in nice condition. It really bothers me that I spend a lot of time and money to keep it nice just for some guy who doesn’t give a fuck to erase all those efforts in a matter of 10 minutes and scratch it all up. I understand that I don’t deserve special treatment when there are other people besides me, but this standard of service shouldn’t be ok especially when it’s my personal property and I am parking to be a customer at the place. 
 If this sort of thing also bothers you, how do you deal with it? I find that most locals with old and beaten bikes do not care. But what if you have a nice modded bike or even a big bike that costs 150mil + vnd? Any suggestions or tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am returning to Vietnam this year (in a few weeks) and I’d like to find some stuff to do that’s a bit different to the typical tourist activities. I’ve booked two weeks in Ho Chi Minh City (located I. District 1) and will be hiring a motorbike to get around (not opposed to getting on a domestic flight though).
 I spent 1 month travelling around Vietnam last year and had an amazing time, I’ve always been curious around this country and the people and I was not disappointed! 
 I am a contemporary artist and work for a University of Fine Arts in Australia so I am really looking for creative things to partake in. There must be a network of musicians and artists in this wonderful city of millions!? When researching online for things to check out it seems like only the really obvious stuff comes up (I can’t help but wonder if it’s because I’m searching from within Australia). I want to see exhibitions by local, innovative artists, maybe undertake some workshops in craft traditions and music gigs by exciting Vietnamese bands! Where can I go or what venues offer this? (not interested in night clubs haha). Thanks for any suggestions ✌️🙏👍

 I dont care if its pirated websites either way changing my vpn to VN for Netflix seems it keeps logging me out of the account and unable to log back in so might as well use Pirated websites. Would Fmovies or soapdrama have them?

I have multiple long term plans of what I am trying to do here in Vietnam, so I will be staying in Da Nang indefinitely. I am looking for a place that I can volunteer in exchange of accommodation, whether it would be teaching kids English, taking care of the elderly, or tending to the victims of agent orange, v.v...
 Doing this will give me a chance to integrate and connect with the locals easier. This is what I did when I first moved to Thailand and also in Portugal. In the meantime during my volunteering, I would be exploring, trying to get familiar with the area and also attempting to find my own place. Will be truly grateful for anyone who has experience in volunteering in Da Nang and be willing to share and help me out with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody !
 I'm from France and I visited Vietnam in october 2018. I loved your country so much, it must have been the best travel of my life. After that, I got interested in vietnamese culture, the food, the language, the music. I listened to popular vietnamese songs on Youtube. Not the oldschool, historically famous ones. More like the hits of the last few years.
 ​
 I remember listening to one song in particular and I just can't find it anymore. It wasnt the best song or anything, but it bugs me because I can see the video clip in my head and it's frustrating. Here is what I know about it : 
  
The main singer was a man 
 It was released before the end of 2019
 The clip is at night, in a big city. A man and a woman are having fun, getting drunk, playing pool. And there's an underlying love story
 I think he's hoping something happens betweem them 
 I think it was rap. But maybe not 100% rap ? 
  
I know it's not much... But if it rings a bell to anyone, it would make my day and remind me great memories ! Thank you

Asked around in the convenience stores and from the little bit we could communicate through google translate, all of them said they don’t sell cigarettes in the area. Will I get some at Circle K in District 1 or just from roadside sellers? (Haven’t gone beyond my area because work ends at dusk, and I did go out the first day after work but got spooked because got approached by different men twice asking where I am from and stuff so not stepping out in the evening anymore)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So me and my partner were walking in some park in HCMC and a guy appeared from nowhere and started pointing at my partner’s shoe. We didn’t understand what he meant so he came closer and took out a funny brush from his “shoe repair and maintenance box” and started quickly washing my bf’s shoes. We both said “No” about five times and soon there was another guy attacking my shoes. They basically took of our shoes from our feet - pretended to wash them with their super duper chemicals and glued an extra heel on my bf’s Birkenstock sandals (which of course came off after a few days and looks hilarious). After finishing their grand hard work of one minute they asked us 500.000 dongs from each of us (~40 euros in total). It’s not that I didn’t expect for them to ask money, I understood it from the very beginning but they were really good and quick in undressing us.. I gave them 500.000 (shouldn’t have) and they asked for another half. I literally showed them my wallet - I didn’t have that much. It is funny that they didn’t agree to take less than 500.000 - they were insisting on their price and I started finally showing my attitude, saying that we didn’t want their “service” in the first place and that we don’t have more money. So I told them let’s call the police. They didn’t like the idea and their hooligan leader took my bf’s shoe and threw it in the trash bin direction. We quickly vanished afterwards. So, our stupidity is not under a question mark - it was our first day in Vietnam, we were probably jetlagged and awed, and just fools. However, we indeed said “no” many many times and actually the next level would’ve been shouting, which we didn’t even consider and our politeness costed us 500000 dongs. My question is about the police - which side would’ve they taken? I assume this shoe business is illegal and we would’ve been right? But I saw so many people in forms in the city (I assume - policemen) - how come is their business still running?

I will join a tour for most of my stay but was planning on arriving in advance to get over jet lag and relax a bit. Do you have any tips for my safety and to avoid scams? Where should I stay and what transport is best from the airport? I read about some taxi scams? I'd be happy to splurge a bit to be in a nice hotel with a swimming pool where I could meet other travellers perhaps and explore the area in advance of the tour (50-75 euro per night). Also, should I have predominantly cash in the local currency? Any generic advice would be appreciated as I'm getting nervous!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, my partner and I live together with his parents, but we are not married. We also live in a European country. My partner has lived here since birth and his parents came here i think shortly after the war. They are both from northern Vietnam. I have only lived here for 4 years. I refer to them as bố and mẹ since I'm learning Vietnamese, and bố told me that since my partner and I are living together, it is the same as being married in Vietnam, and that it's fine for me to call them bố and mẹ since its normal to call your in-laws mom and dad, and this is also common in the culture that I grew up in. The issue/thing that is confusing me is that while neither have an issue with me calling them that, bố always responds for himself as bố , while mẹ switches between mẹ and cô. I only use simple vietnamese at the moment, but an example would be:I: khi nào bố sẽ đi làm ? B: bố đi làm lúc (time)
 Mẹ would use the same or respond with cô. Is this a regional or cultural thing, or is this because there is no blood relation? I don't think I have heard her use it with my partner or her daughter, but it oculd be that I missed it because I'm still learning the language. I also thought that it might be similar to how bạn, tôi is used as another exception pronoun. Do other non-vietnamese people also refer to their vietnamese in-laws in the same way?

 However, I cannot just look it up online because what is posted about how the government works is not how it goes in real life. 
 For example this was on the official government site: The Constitution clearly indicates that the state power is in the hand of the people. The State is of the people, by the people and for the people.

I visited my wife’s family in HCMC and now I have dreams of coming to live there too. I, of course, would try to find our own place to live as I would never want to burden my wife’s family.
 However, when telling my wife’s family that I want to move there they continuously tell us never to move there. When asked if they would ever move to the USA they always say no because it is boring, dangerous, and they love the life they have in Vietnam. I don’t understand why someone would tell me not to live somewhere if they would not leave that place at the first opportunity. They live a great life in Vietnam and my wife’s brother is always taking trips to other nearby countries and buying expensive things as a flight attendant. 
 I make a lot more money here in the USA, but with the rising cost of living and potential economic recession, I wish for a life that is much simpler. Am I wrong for wanting that? Am I wrong for thinking they might be hypocrites? Am I wrong for thinking I could have a much more comfortable life there? Please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 I'm near done mapping out a trip to Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. I have a hostel for Ho Chi Minh but plan to just find places to stay as I go and stop. I’m getting a motorbike so these places that are for 1 day are just stop overs with maybe ¾ of the day for exploring, hence the odd day calculations…just want to be realistic.
 In total the trip is 29 days long but ultimately wondering what people’s opinions are at the times in these locations? Am I spending too much/too little time in places or prioritizing the wrong places? The only thing set in stone is Ha Long Bay, I’ll need to be there by the 26th day. My hostel in HCMC is also booked but was $12/night so is a wash if things change.
 The trip is pretty linear so things to an extent can be cut and put other places. Would love folks opinions cause most things I read say everywhere is amazing and I don’t have all the time haha!
 (3.75 days) Days 1 to 5 Ho Chi Minh City
 *I originally had 3 days is this too much time at 4 days? Worried Jet lag will put me out of commission for the day, but I arrive around noon my first day
 (1.75 days) Day 5 to 7 Phan Thiet/Mui Ne
 *Should I take a day here and give it to Dalat? Should I skip?
 (.75 days) Day 7 to 8 Dalat
 (1.75 days) Day 8 to 10 Nha Trong
 (.75 days) Days 10 to 11 Quy Nhon
 *Could go straight to Pleiku but have heard good things about Quy Nhon?
 (.75 days) Days 11 to 12 Pleiku
 (2.75 days) Days 12 to 15 Hoi An/Da Nang
 (1.75 days) Days 15 to 17 Hue
 (1.75 days) Days 17 to 19 Phong Nha
 *Wanted to do only 1 day but think if I wanna see the caves will need a whole extra day
 (.75 days) Days 19 to 20 Vinh or Thai Hoa
 *OR I am going to skip and take a bus from Dong Hoi to Ninh Binh saving a day
 (1.75 days) Days 20 to 22 Ninh Binh
 (3.75 days) Days 22 to 26 Hanoi
 (2.75 days) Days 26 to 28 Ha Long Bay *Already booked
 (1 day) Day 28-29 Stay Near Airport in Hanoi and Go Home

Would just like to ask if abortion procedure is available for tourist. I’m suspecting that I am currently pregnant (around week 2) and can’t afford to have this at the moment due to multiple personal problems. Thank you and sorry if i offend anyone here regarding this topic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I want to make a music playlist or compilation for my parents of music they might have listened to in their youth. It's both for them just for fun but also in case one of them develops dementia or Alzheimer's disease. If you didn't know, playing music from someone's formative years can help them have clear and lucid moments if they have a cognitive degenerative disease. 
 Does anyone have specific artist suggestions and where to find them? I am in the US so I usually use Youtube or Spotify to search for music and I'm not aware of what services in VN would have music from that era. Anyway, when I have searched on google, I see a lot of articles about early rock and roll in Sai Gon. I don't think my parents would have listened to that or gone to any of those clubs since they are from Central and rarely traveled to Sai Gon. 
 I believe it would be very meaningful to my parents so thank you in advance.

 I bought a total of 11 key chains and 3 magnets for 270k at the gift shop for family and friends. 
 It's a cash only place and while counting my money, 2x100k, 2x10k and 1x500k instead of 50k, while I was checking my money but the old lady at the shop snatched the money. I just got back to the hotel after 4 hours of walking and exploring. 
 Any Vietnamese folks here think it's even remotely possible to retrieve or forget and enjoy the rest of the trip here?
 TL;DR - Lost 500k vnd instead of 50k note because cashier lady rushed and snatched it before we could double check.

 Ive basically grown up here in the US, and I do not know if my accounting degree will benefit me in Vietnam. My main questions are: 
  
How is the job market for accountants? Are accountants in demand with the rapid economic growth Vietnam is having? 
 
What is the avg salary for accountants in Vietnam? 
 
Will a US degree of Accounting benefit my career in Vietnam, as I know Vietnam has different accounting procedures compared to Western procedures?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, one of friends loooves Vietnam, and has been learning the language for the past 6 years. He is now fluent in the spoken and written language (although he’s read a bunch of classic literature so some people tell him he speaks like he’s from the 1920s hahaha). He’s traveled in Vietnam for probably 1.5 years total. 
 The other night I was showing him this old book I found about social etiquette in the US in the early 1900s. It had very specific things like “how to write a letter of apology” or “how to help someone out of a carriage.“ As we were reading, he said, “I wish I could find a book like this about the nuances of Vietnamese culture!”
 I’ve looked around the internet, but because I cant speak Vietnamese, most of the books I find are travel books for people that don’t know anything about the country. I’d love suggestions about books written in Vietnamese about the “unspoken“ rules and nuances of Vietnamese culture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I will be coming to Vietnam at the end of May. I was planning to do an overnight cruise in Ha Long Bay during my trip, however some of the threads have me a bit concerned. 
 A lot of posts in different forums have mentioned about the bay being extremely dirty with floating garbage in most places and smelling of diesel everywhere. Since a lot of these posts are from different years I want to know from someone who has been there recently if that is still the case? If so how badly does it affect the experience? I'm mostly interested in the views and maybe kayaking so please tell according to that. I also read some suggesting to opt for day cruise instead but I have my heart set on spending at least one night under the stars with scenic view on the cruise, are my expectations too much?
 Is it worth spending extra for better quality cruises? I don't plan on splurging what the best 5 star cruises cost, so will probably look for a relatively cheap 5 star or a 4 star cruise. Are they considerably better than the budget/3 star cruises or if I'm not going for the top tier it makes no difference?
 Is Lan Ha Bay a better option? As long as the views are good I won't mind a switch. If the views are not that good but the crowd is considerably less then I will even prefer it. I can compromise on activities a bit as well.
 Please let me know your thoughts.

 So where can I get a full parasite test in Hanoi?

I've had an itchy mouth whenever I eat peanuts so I went for a test at a clinic, it came back that I'm allergic to peanuts (only low on the scale but I know it can get worse with exposure). They didn't prescribe me an epipen but I want one for peace of mind. 
 Is this possible here? Do I need a prescription or can I go to a pharmacy and buy one? Do they even exist here?

How easy it is to organise service: getting wifi set up, a couch delivered, Grab food. Everything is so quick!
 
In my opinion, people are kinder in Vietnam. There’s something about the way people interact and occupy space which seems more collegial. 
 
The cost of living is so much less oppressive. I know it’s a privilege to be able to say that. 
 
 I’ve been here since 2015, living and working full-time. So, before anyone asks if I’m in expat honeymoon phase…nope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, I visited Vietnam and got this great face wash in the store when I forgot to bring my own. I didn't get to buy more before leaving, and now I want to buy a good amount and ship it to the U.S. However, all of the websites that I found selling the same face wash only ship within Vietnam. Does anyone know any way I can get it shipped to the U.S.? Alternatively, is there a similar face wash I can get in the U.S.? A lot of the U.S. brands are really bad for my skin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading an article about the oscar winning actor Ke huy quan, who was part of an ethnic chinese minority community in vietnam. He lived in a mainly chinese area of saigon and fled the country with his family after the south lost. The article mentions that “most” of the people who left south vietnam in the 70s were of chinese origin as well. This was surprising to me as i always thought it was mainly people of viet descent and maybe only a few chinese (I only know what i was told since im 2nd gen and was born way after my grandparents left). But do you think this was likely true about boat people being mostly chinese? If so why would mainly chinese people have been the ones to leave vietnam after the end of the war?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as the subject says… I’m an oxycodone addict - and could use some advice… 
 I am tremendously embarrassed that I’ve gotten myself into this position, but long story short - I recently sold a business to a large multi-national corporation who has an office in Ho Chi Minh. I’ll be traveling to the office next week - but am concerned about the risks associated with traveling through customs with oxycodone pills… without them I’d be going through intense withdrawals, so I have to either do the trip and bring pills with me, or find an excuse to cancel the trip outright - which would have some pretty damaging outcomes (and could literally reduce my remaining earn-out from the acquisition by millions of dollars usd).
 I’m not looking for comments on getting clean or other judgements at this phase - I have my own plans for how I’m going to achieve that once the financial aspect of the sale and related earn-outs are completed…. But I do want to better understand the risks id be taking if I travel to VN and going through customs with oxy pills.
 Can someone help clarify what the laws are? Especially for USA foreigners traveling for work?
 To be clear - I don’t have a script and when I travel in the USA I just put them in a pill bottle for an old unrelated medication. Considering doing the same here - but haven’t travelled to VN before and I’m seeing conflicting details on the web about our drug laws and related punishments.
 Thanks for your help and non judgement!

 Hàn Mặc Tử is also a man who really likes making poems in the new style (he will never be someone like Xuân Diệu who is just a man that adopted the French's poems and turned it into his own style). His early works before he got lyprosy were very similar to Xuân Diệu, the newest poets of the movement. After that though, his poems suddenly changes style to reflect on the suffering he had to endure, while maintaining his love for life around.
 It's weird, but the way he used words that are just plain visceral, and sometimes is borderline insane (his style was the crazy one during the movement). There's a certain level of sur…]]></summary>

 Some of you guys may know about Pro Wrestling - an art with combination of stage techniques and wrestling together to entertain people. Or you will familiarize with the name WWE, home of many famous athletes like John Cena, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Dave Bautista,..etc. At Saigon there was a group of many young and talented guys with the love for pro wrestling call Vietnam Pro Wrestling (VPW for short). They have trained and organized many shows to Vietnam fans. Starting from a small dance studio with 30-50 people, wrestling on mat to nowaday performing on real wrestling ring, with attendance around 200-300 people per show.
 This June 3rd, they will organized their biggest event in the year called Ultimate Collision. Beside our Vietnamese wrestlers, we will have attendance from other wrestlers in Southeast Asia. So if you guy want to experience a burning hot and energetic Saturday night, maybe take your free time to attend their incoming show. More details on Vietnam Pro Wrestling facebook page.

 https://wisevoter.com/country-rankings/divorce-rates-by-country/
 https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/divorce-rates-by-country
 Vietnam has a marriage divorce rate at around 0.2 per 1000 people or around 5-10% of all vietnamese people will get divorced. Compared to the US were almost 50% of married people will get a divorce. That is about a 10x of the rate in US. Anyone has some light to shed on the reason why this is the case? Comment from article. 
  
Lowest Divorce Rate in the World Vietnam possesses the lowest divorce rate in the world, at 0.2 per 1,000 people. This is an impressive feat for a country with a population of over 97 million, as it indicates that couples in the region are more likely to stay together than those living elsewhere in the world. In addition to this, Vietnam has one of the highest marriage rates overall. The culture puts considerable emphasis on family and loyalty within relationships, which helps explain why divorce rates are so low. Furthermore, marriage is seen as a means of protection from poverty or any other form of financial instability as couples share costs and resources. Finally, societal norms and expectations play a major role; especially amongst older generations who frown upon divorce and may even threaten older married couples with social exclusion if they decide to end their marriages. All these factors combine to result in very low divorce rates in Vietnam compared to other countries around the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started watching some Vietnamese movies in order to practice Vietnamese and started to wonder about the type of content that can be seen in Vietnam.
 Does Vietnam allow certain amounts of gore, blood, or violence to be shown in TV shows or movies or is it really limited in what can be seen? Is nudity allowed in media or is it partially censored like in countries like Japan? Is porn illegal in the country or is it allowed?
 Sorry for the questions but I was just curious to know what directors and writers are dealing with when creating shows or films in the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have browsed on many Vietnamese forums, subreddits and even Youtube videos. Once or twice, I would see a Vietnamese netizen drop this word Tây Lông.
 Apparently this is a word used to ridicule Westerners in general, as it translates literally to “hairy Westerners”. I have seen very negative attitudes towards Westerners in communities such as r/trotruyenlinhtinh, where they seem to have a negative bias against Westerners.
 Personally I would never stoop down that low and use that word, regardless of the social situations, like even if a Western tourist was rude. But how is the word perceived by Vietnamese people? Should this word be considered rude and offensive?
 EDIT: Apologise, the subreddit name is r/trochuyenlinhtinh, instead of r/trotruyenlinhtinh, rookie mistake on my Vietnamese spelling part lol

But it was portguese missionaries who where the first Europeans that came to vietnam and latinize the classically written classical script of Vietnamese.
 So my question is, does anyone know more history about how the portuguese language influenced Vietnamese? I was learning brazilian portuguese independently and noticed some similarities with Vietnamese. For example the use of the ~ tilde accent mark, and the "nh" constant cluster sounding like "y". I was able to find this article and a few comments on the Vietnamese alphabet Wikipedia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 Recently I am considering studying Data Analytics for a possible Data Analyst/Business Analyst job (heard they're often strongly related), so I wanted to ask some questions about the market here in Vietnam or East Asia with a specific focus on foreigners, since I am one.
 Hope there is someone in this group currently doing these types of job here in Vietnam or in East Asia that can provide some insights.
 I have a Bachelor degree in Chinese studies, so not related, just recently completed an internship in my country's chamber of commerce here in Vietnam.
 I would start from scratch and self-study online (I know it's not easy but I did it before and got some certifications on Coursera, Udemy etc...).
 Questions:
 1) Is there a fundamental language barrier when it comes to the data in relationship to the country you are working in? More specifically, will the data be in the local language? / Do you need to have proficiency in the local language in order to find a job in the field?
 2) Is it sensible for a foreigner to search for those types of job or will a local professional always be preferred?
 3) Briefly, how would you describe your experience in this field here in Vietnam or East Asia as a foreigner? Positives, negatives, up, downs?
 4) Finally, do you have any tips or recommendations?
 Thought this may be useful for any foreigner wondering about their career in Asia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know reddit is not the best place for to ask for advice on life changing decisions, but I'm struggling to make a decision. I've booked a flight to Vietnam, which is less than 1 month away, but I'm on the verge of canceling the whole thing. 
 To give a bit of background, I've lived in the UK for almost half of my life. I left Vietnam during my high school years and have been working/studying here ever since. I have a good job, earning well above average wage and I'm happy with all aspects of my life here. 
 I go back to Vietnam once in a while and was surprised by how much things have changed. There definitely are a lot of opportunities there, especially when it comes to having your own start up firm, and potentially earn way more than if I continue as a salary worker in the UK after taking into account of the cost of living. That and the fact that my parents are getting old and I want to spend time with them, made me want to go back. 
 However, within the last 2 months, as I've been saying goodbye to everything and everyone I know here, I just feel a sense of sadness that I'm leaving my comfortable life and good career behind for something that might not work out. I feel like I might be making a big mistake. To make it worse, I'm almost certain now that my relationships with my parents are beyond repair, and we won't get along no matter what. 
 My flight is just a few weeks away and I feel very much like just not going to the airport, and just telling my boss that I'm not leaving anymore and going back to the way it was before.
 I'm just posting it on here in the slim chance that someone might have been in the same boat and have some advice to offer.

I wonder if it's okay when I go to Vietnamese places like Little Saigon and speak with my "Hanoi" accent normally there. I never been to the States before, tho, and I heard a few guys got threatened or discriminated by speaking those accent. Idk if they were just joking or sum tho.
 Moreover, how should I behave there? should I just be normal like in Vietnam or is there something I need to worry about? I'm sorry if my question triggered some of you guys. I know the history and have no hate towards 'boat people' at all. It's just i never been to The States so I really need this kind of information.
 Btw, thanks for helping me my fellow redditors, hope y'all have productive day 😁

 One day, as he was preparing his banh bao for the day, he was visited by a strange, otherworldly presence. The entity introduced itself as Ong Tao, the kitchen god, and explained that it had been watching Thực's selfless work and recognized his desire to help others through the power of food.

Từ sau lần cuối xảy ra sự kiện đó, chúng ta đã quá quen thuộc với cái nóng và đã dần thích nghi với nó. Đã gần 300 năm kể từ khi những con quái vật từ trong mặt trời xuất hiện. Chúng ta đã chiến đấu và kết quả nhận được là sự diệt vong trên diện rộng do bão mặt trời từ những con quái vật gây ra. Trong một khu bảo an cuối cùng của nhân loại. Cương vội rít nhẹ điếu thuốc lá có thể xem là còn sót lại cuối cùng trên vũ trụ này. Vốn dĩ anh không hề thích thuốc lá, nhưng từ sau khi chứng kiến Dương, người bạn thân giàu sinh ra tử cùng mình lại biến mất một cách bí ẩn thì anh ta cũng đã thay đổi thói quen và tính cách. Ngày hôm nay cũng như mọi ngày Cương vẫn vậy. Tay cầm khẩu súng và leo lên trạm quan sát. Từ góc nhìn này anh có thể nhìn thấy toàn cảnh khu bảo an. Những đứa nhóc chạy chơi xung quanh những bãi cỏ bị cháy và những người lớn đang canh tác trên những cánh đồng khô héo, xa hơn có thể thấy những thành phố mà anh chỉ được nghe kể về thời kỳ mà con người vẫn còn làm chủ hành tinh này từ những người lớn tuổi. Bất giác anh như vô thức lau đi những giọt mồ hôi chen lẫn nước mắt khi nghĩ về nó. Rồi anh lại hướng mắt xa hơn về phía đó. Bất chợt anh thấy từ xa có vẻ có người đang đi về phía trại bảo an. Ngay lập tức anh ra hiệu cảnh báo để toàn trại vào trạng thái chiến đấu. Các hệ thống cảnh báo vang lên gầm rú như tiếng súng nổ. Các ụ súng và hệ thống tên lửa được kích hoạt, các chiến binh đều đã vào hệ thống công sự để phòng thủ. Bất ngờ Cương vội ra hiệu tắt hệ thống cảnh báo và phòng thủ vì hình như anh nhận ra điều gì đó... Hết tập 1... Mình mới tập viết truyện để giải sầu vì cuộc sống thực nó quá tiêu cực với mình. Ae xem nếu không thích thì cmt để mình gỡ nha, cảm ơn các bạn ! Vô Danh !!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can’t tell if it’s either just how some people are/how the workplace can be. 
 I’m a 21m student and I took a job as a waiter at a Vietnamese restaurant. I was born in Germany, but both my parents are Vietnamese and my Vietnamese is enough to hold a conversation and, after having worked one year at the restaurant, I communicate with my colleagues in Vietnamese during work without any problems. 
 I shortly shelved products at a supermarket before working as a waiter, so I don’t have much experience, but wanted to earn some money on the side. 
 I’m quite committed to my job, maybe a little foolishly so. If I get called short-notice, I come to work. I can get a bad conscience when thinking about customers not getting decent service or my colleagues getting under too much pressure. I have dr…]]></summary>
