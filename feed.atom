        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im planning to write an article related to this topic, hence would like to collect your sharing.
 I observe that social media (especially Facebook watch) is definately creating a negative personality of my parents and other middle aged adults in general. I saw them watch several meaningless and no value contents (in many topics, for example: cancer maker (without any verification), some dudes telling you how to live a life lol) then they share to us with the thought that it’s a reference that we should follow and absorb. It’s hard to say but I feel like the social media is changing the middle-aged people’s mental health. I think because they aren’t growing up with the social media like us (late of Gen Y and on) so they are lacking of “pick and choose tools” when using social media. They are the most vulnerable social media users I think. What u think bout this? Let’s share some thoughts or any practical case?

 Firstly, I just want to know is Ho Chi Minh cashless friendly ? I’m there for 5 days only to shop, eat and chill. Secondly, My plan is to change 50% of my currency 50% in card. Is that a good or bad idea ?
 Lastly, if they do accept cards are they typically the paywave that don’t require me to insert the card and enter they key?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 I'm thinking of buying Apple Watch and would like to ask several questions on how it is suitable for usage in Vietnam for my purposes.
 What I have: iPhone + 'SimA' and going to buy Apple Watch Series 9 41mm with eSim support (and I put there 'SimB').
 - Can I leave the phone at home and go out with the watch + 'SimB' only and be able to see messages on facebook and Zalo and write/record basic replies (without having any kind of headset)?
 - Can I see/reply to calls/sms which come to 'SimA' (which is in the phone) when I'm outdoors with the watch only (the phone is at home)?
 - Can I use the phone to answer calls/sms which come to the 'SimB' (which in the watch)?
 - Can I use the watch to order grab car/bike and see how the car/bike is approaching on the map?
 - Can I make Sacombank money transfers using the watch only?
 I know that there are Grab/FB/Zalo apps for Apple Watch but I'm curious how they are actually usable (especially on 41mm watch screen)? Also it is not clear if there is a 'full' Sacombank app (or Apple Pay support only).
 I appreciate any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my wife where travelling the Mai Chau valley, just enjoying the view, going through the villages. One of the houses was blasting dance music, we went over and saw the locals are having a birthday.
 For some reason they really, really, really wanted us to join them and we figured why not. So we danced a little and they immediately offered us their booze (don't really know what it was, maybe banana wine?), we drank one glass but they really really wanted us to drink more, at some point we really had to push them off. When we figured we want to leave they grabbed us by the hands (as if to keep on dancing with us) and they where actually holding unreasonable firmly, one might even call it violently. At the end we managed to shake them off and just wave them goodbye.
 It's important to note, the whole settings where very friendly, there where Children, women and elderly in the party, so we don't think those guys had bad intentions and do us harm. We do wonder why they where so keen on having us on their celebration and why the hell where they holding so strongly?

The motivation behind my inquiry is that many of my wife's friends have experienced divorce, or remarriage, or are seeking partners with more financial stability than their exes. some of their husbands, who happen to be my friends, claim a common issue of feeling controlled. 
 In contrast, I have been clear with my wife that either of you is free to walk away without strings attached if the relationship reaches a point of no hope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep reading on different websites that HCMC has nightlife that almost rivals Bangkok, how it's the second biggest party spot in SEA, etc.
 Just got here last night. Bui Ven seems to have more people in the street than the actual clubs and it all started to die down at midnight. Lush was tiny and about 75% empty. Faham just had some small groups sitting down with balloons, Observatory was dead...
 For a Friday night after all the hype I saw online I was a bit disappointed. Am I just going to the wrong places or does Vietnam just not have a nightlife oriented culture?

Bánh đúc nóng (a snack falty food with rice cake dipped with fish sauce, pork, cilantro, fried scallions) 
 Cháo sườn (pork-ribs congee)
 Bánh trôi tàu ( hot sweet ginger soup, rice cakes filled with sesame, top with coconut and peanuts) 
 Cháo đậu cà (rice congee with fried tofu and salted eggplant fruit): apparently i just know this dish recently havent tried it but its known for a very famous dish for people here to eat in autumn-winter.

 I’ve been travelling to Vietnam for a few weeks now and loving it so far. I want to have a chilled weekend in Ho Chi Minh City.
 In Hanoi, I loved to chill at Hoan Kiem Lake - I just had a nice time just sitting/walking around there and I found that locals would approach to practice their English with me there which made it extra nice.
 If there somewhere similar in HCMC? I’m in District 1 but don’t mind wandering.
 All suggestions welcome! Thanks!
 EDIT: it doesn’t even have to be the whole day/weekday but is there somewhere that’s just nice to walk around?

 Mostly just want to know the best way to go about this as we're all excited and a little bit nervous and I would like things to go as smoothly as possible!
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious, with how open Vietnam is today and how many people will fall in love across all kinds of identities and nationalities I imagine plenty of folk will be born in Vietnam in a mixed family. Especially in Saigon.
 For anyone with knowledge on this, what í that like? Is there bullying in the local schools? Anything to worry about? What can you share?
 Thank you

Are they there to sire additional chickens, to be a watchdog for security purposes, etc.? From my and I’m sure 99.99% other neighboring residents’ perspective, it’s just another source of rude, inconsiderate noise (as probably hundreds of people are subjected to it; fortunately I’m not right next door, but I feel for those who are). Or should it be regarded as just another source of local “color?”

Besides things like medicine, clothes, and accessories; I would like to buy them something that would improve their quality of life.

But since they're bulky and are pretty readily available in Vietnam, should I buy it here or wait until I get home? I really appreciate any other gift ideas as well!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit Vietnam brains trust. Hoping someone can help me out, with quite a specific and niche type question in regards to a Vietnam eSim provider for mobile/cell phones.
 I was in a rush flying out of Vietnam last week. My physical Vietnamese sim cardoesn'tnt support global roaming.
 I need a local Vietnam number (eSim only as I'm not in Vietnam atm) to receive calls/text messages while overseas (ie needs to offer global roaming capability).
 Seems the majority of eSim providers for Vietnam, don't offer global roaming + local Vietnamese number. 
 Zalo, Skype and Viber are the less preferred options, as I need to be contactable on a local Vietnamese number.
 Think I'm out of luck and will have to use alternative methods, till I'm back in Vietnam. Unless someone on here can help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Cross-posted from r/trans)
 Hi! I’m new to the community but would like some help choosing a name from the members of this sub!
 I am a 2nd generation Vietnamese-American with both parents from south Vietnam. I have gone through many names during my time of being kinda out as trans-masculine and all of them have been either generically white male names or just English words. I’m hoping to legally change my name soon to something more permanent and closely tied to my culture. I have been immersed in Vietnamese culture and tradition ever since I was a child but when I was born I was given an American name instead of a Vietnamese one. I used to be grateful for this because it reduced the amount of bullying I got for being Asian but now I just want a name that connects to the culture and people that raised me.
 I’d just like some suggestions from other Vietnamese people on male names :) I’d also accept and consider just object names! I used to go by Zero at one point so I’m no stranger to non-name sounding names lmao
 Thank you in advance! :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This accident happened about 10 meters in front of me today and in real time. Probably a 3-4 year old kid standing on the motorcycle with both his parents sitting in front and behind him, and as always, he wasn't wearing a helmet but the parents were.
 The dad driver did a close maneuever to overtake a public bus but probably forgot about the son standing right behind him. Consequently, the kid's head collided with the side mirror of the bus, causing him to lose balance and fall off the bike. But lucky enough, he fell AWAY from the bus or else it would be a much bloodier scene.
 I don't get this, you can afford a bike, you can afford two helmets each for yourself and your wife, you can afford clothes, you can probably afford a smartphone as well, but a child's helmet crosses the line? Here's an unpopular opinion, if you can't financially & mentally afford a child's helmet, then you probably shouldn't have a child. Don't even get me started on letting your child stand on a moving bike. It was a cringey horror scene but I kinda felt like it should happen more often for them to finally learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 First of all, my situation:
 I've been living in HCMC for almost 2 years now but I'm thinking of leaving. My reasons are the high rent, the noise and air pollution, and the traffic.
 Rent here is the highest in Vietnam I think, higher than in Ha Noi I've been told.
 About noise, I tried lots of places and honestly outside of "luxury" high rise appartments, other places are affected by noise at night or early morning to the point of being unlivable. I got really depressed once because a place a rented had neighbours arguing all day, karaoke and loud drunk talking at night, funerals,... 
 About air pollution, it's worse these days, I can see smog most time I look outside from a high enough floor.
 Traffic is also getting worse. I came to HCMC right at the end of COVID quarantine so it was somewhat normal then, then it got gradually worse. 
 Now my question: I'm considering moving to another city, probably Da Nang. Is Da Nang really better in terma of rent, noise, air and traffic? I've been there once and think it's better but it was just a short trip so I'm not sure, heard some stories about karaoke in Da Nang so I want to hear more from everyone.

 I just moved into a studio apartment in D1 in HCMC. Got a decent price: around 7.5mil per month. Just a small bedroom and bathroom, no living room or anything. 
 I wanted to check the electric meter outside my room so I turned off electronics and it wasn’t moving. So far so good. 
 I don’t use the fridge , so it’s been off the whole month. Most of my electric usage is for my A/C that runs about 12 hours per day. Otherwise the only other electricity I use is for charging my laptop, or my projector if I’m using it (rarely).
 Electric bill comes in at the end of the month a staggering 1 million vnd! I speak to a neighbor from the house next door. He says he’s paying around 400k for the entire house! 
 Now I know the price per KW is 3.000 vnđ, but the landlords make a profit by charging 4.000 vnd. So I’m thinking that either my A/C is super congested and using up a ton of electricity or my landlord is somehow screwing me. 
 Any thoughts? I will be talking to him about this issue in 2 days when I pay rent.

I was in a LT relationship that recently ended and so that factored in with the work leave is making me think now may be a good time however, it'd be a solo trip and pretty spontaneous due to time.
 My travel window would be likely Dec 8 - 21st. Outside of the US, I've traveled to Asia three times (Japan once, Korea twice). I did solo travel to Japan but I knew very basic Japanese and don't know any Vietnamese.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm going to Vietnam in a month, I'm from Italy so EURO.
 I have Curve, Revolut and BBVA and none of them charge me for exchange fees or atm withdrawal abroad.
 I've read though that in Vietnam every time you withdraw from an ATM or pay with a card you are charged an extra ~3% fee from the Vietnamese bank. Is that so?
 What's the most convenient option? Is exchanging EURO at the airport the cheapest option?
 ​
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm from New Zealand and learned recently that the Cham people speak an Austronesian language, which is the same linguistic family as Te Reo Māori from NZ. 
 What I've also noticed is that Vietnamese seems to have some loan words from the Cham language, like:
 Eye - mắt - mblak (Cham). Mata (Māori) can mean face, but may sometimes refer to eye, eyebrow, or looking out. The Cham word for face is also mata.
 This - này - ne (Cham) - nei (Māori) (usually used as tēnei, but also by itself, like in ā te pō nei (this night).
 There are quite a few more that I found.
 Because of these similarities, could there be more of a Cham influence on Vietnamese than I thought? Is it common knowledge that the Cham language has influence on Vietnamese and vice versa?

I had been using a book to figure out what all fruits can be added (as main or substitutions) in it and it mentioned figs as one of the substitution that can be added on the tray and it stuck with me and I made a design with that as well. Now I found some websites that claimed figs are not used at all and its making me nervous as I don't have enough time to remove it from the design before I am to showcase the collection for marking. So before I chuck it out of my collection, I thought I should come here amd ask you guys. What do you think I should do?

Sometimes, a vacuum is formed from the heat and condensation and seals the lid shut, causing the coffee to not drip into the cup. Am I supposed to break the vacuum seal? Do I just leave it for 10-15 minutes until the temps drop and the vacuum breaks on its own? Is a vacuum seal supposed to even happen?
 Sorry, I am new to dripping my own coffee. Please don’t flame me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning a trip to Hanoi for 2week trip in march. I plan to have some luxury stays and some very minimal cheap stays to get a feel of what I can bare. I am getting tired of US politics and crazy events lately. I want to learn more the resilience and beliefs of Vietnamese and maybe Buddhism. 
 Ultimately I want to see if I can be retired snowbird in Vietnam Jan-April or live in the region (Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, ect..). I am 53 and healthy and athletic. I raised two wonderful adult ladies and separating from a controlling spouse. I want to be free and take someone that we can mutually take care of each other. I want to connect with authentic people/community that support each other and live a less complicated life.
 I am a Korean migrated to US and I never felt I belonged. I look Korean but white in the inside with my upbringing. I am looking back now and want to meet people like me. Think differently, feel, love. I am looking for friends to hang out and eat and go to clubs. New connections that will pull me back to Asia and feel at home. 
 Question 1. What would be better than Hanoi for value for money compared to other Asian cities. 
 Question 2. Do you find it's easy to make good authentic friendship with travelers and local people? Is it easy to date and any advice on best way to find activities with other singles wanting to connect in Hanoi. Connect and travel together?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'd like to learn Vietnamese but I don't know where to start. I have no prior exposure of the language or country whatsoever so I really am clueless about Vietnamese culture. However after doing a little research I found out that people are divided on what the standard dialect of Vietnamese is. Google articles say the standard dialect is Northern Vietnamese but will also tell you that you should learn the Southern dialect instead and materials that teach you the Northern dialect I've noticed are kind of frowned upon. I really have no idea what these mean Which sounds stupid I know but that's why I'll take the time to learn. Does it really matter which dialect I will learn between those two? Are the differences between the two dialects really that noticeable to the point of miscommunication? I also noticed that learning Vietnamese is also not as accessible as learning other languages like Chinese or German so if anyone has/know any free resources to learn Vietnamese then I'd appreciate if you'll share it in the comments... Thankss

 Also, I would like to know some recommendations for a 3-day tour doable by people ranging from 18 to 68 years old. I hope you can help me out in this tour. Ideas about the public transportation access will also be helpful. 
 Thanks so much! Looking forward to your replies! :)

 It seems to me that the priority line is mainly for aircrew staff. Do these immigration line "fast-track" services "bribe" immigration officials so customers could use that line also?
 I've also heard that the line closest to the priority immigration line (heard towards the left) tends to be quickest. Has anyone experienced that to be true?

 The wife and I want to go to vũng tàu soon. I'm Người nước ngoài, and she's originally from Vietnam but grew up abroad, where we met. We now live in Vietnam.
 She remembers Vũng tàu public beaches with food vendors, beer vendors, chair vendors, etc. I've been to beaches like this, and while you always need to watch yourself from getting ripped off, I enjoy having the option to buy some food and drinks from people coming up right to your spot on the beach and the variety of stuff that they might bring. She remembers it fondly too. But I've read that the govt has possibly restricted vendors from these beaches? Is this true? And are there no beaches that have these vendors? We're trying to plan the trip and I can't find any real answers can someone help me?
 Nước ngoài translation:
 Tôi (người nước ngoài) và vợ muốn đi du lịch ở vũng tàu để đi biển, đi chơi, ăn hải sản, v.v... vợ tôi nhớ vũng tàu có nhiều người bán đồ ăn, bìa, thuê ghế ở biển. Tôi đã đi biển khác mà có người bán, và tôi rất là thích Những mà, tôi mới đọc mầ chín phủ không cho phép người bán trên biển nữa. Có đúng không?.
 Sorry if that Vietnamese gives anyone heartburn. Thanks for the advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finhay is an investing app that my wife and I came across a few years back. The interest rates are about 2% higher than traditional banks. We put a fair bit of money in it, collected nice interest, and used it to pay off our mortgage. As we start building up our savings again, we are questioning whether to continue saving money in Finhay at higher interest rates (~8%) or to put it in traditional banks (~6%), which of course have risks of their own in Vietnam's relatively wild west financial system.
 I'd love to hear any insight you all have on the safety & risks of Finhay. Thanks so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello some friends and I are staying in Halong Bay in February and were wondering if anyone had any recommendations for two day overnight cruises that also visit Ninh Binh. Seems like from looking online most of those are three days but unfortunately we can’t do that. Additionally, most of our group are fluent in Vietnamese. Thank you!

Honestly with the wife so some fireworks and a nice fun vibe would be cool. Just not sure if its worth to stay 5 nights in Saigon just for NYE when the caves and mountains in the north are calling.

Also, I have videos of him running away from me, but guess those are unlikely to help unless there are cameras on the streets showing his face. Thanks for your help

 I am 21F from the US and planning my first trip abroad and intend on it being to Vietnam. In school I learned a lot about Vietnamese history which caused me to want Vietnam or China as my first location and I settled on Vietnam. 
 Because it’s my first trip I want to be able to spend without much worry shopping and food wise. And be in a semi nice/clean hotel. I also intend to hire a Vietnam local to help with navigation, translation, etc. so a few questions. 
 How much should I budget for hotel? Any suggestions?
 How much should I budget for shopping?
 How much should I budget for bribes/transportation?
 I plan to travel to a popular city and more “normal” aka less touristy city if you have any suggestions. 
 I also plan on paying my guide/new friend around 7 mil vnd each week (plan to stay for 1-3) and I’m not sure if this is sufficient based on the current economy, I would pay for all food, transportation, etc while they are with me. 
 Any other travel suggestions as an early 20s female traveling alone in Vietnam is welcome and thank you in advance.

 tui đang cần tìm các từ đồng nghĩa hoặc cách nói khác của “(không) quan tâm”. ko phải quan tâm theo kiểu chăm sóc mà là quan tâm, để ý những điều người khác nghĩ hoặc nói
 hiện tại tui đang có những từ/cụm từ sau:
 để ý, để tâm, để bụng
 mặc kệ, để ngoài tai, kệ xác, kệ mẹ, kệ bà, kệ mợ, bơ, bơ đi mà sống…
 tui vẫn cần tìm thêm, càng dân dã hoặc càng trẻ trâu thì càng tốt. tui cần tìm nhiều và đa dạng chứ ko cần đúng ngữ cảnh nên có từ nào mí bồ cứ liệt kê hết giùm tui nha
 chỉ có là ko được trộn tiếng Anh nên là mấy cái như đ' care hay đếch care là hong được. với là tui cần tìm cách nói khác của từ (không) quan tâm chứ ko phải câu thoại thể hiện thái độ không quan tâm nên là cũng ko phải kiểu “nhún vai và nói ’tưởng bố mày quan tâm à?’“

Mình năm nay 19 tuổi, sống ở Ninh Bình. Đáng ra giờ này mình đang năm 2 đại học, tuy nhiên vì 1 số biến cố mà mình vẫn đang ở nhà nuôi mộng đại học. Và quãng thời gian này mình đang cảm thấy rất tuyệt vọng, mình có những kế hoạch, và mình sợ nó sẽ mãi không thành hiện thực. Để tập trung vào chuyện học hành thì mình đã bỏ hoàn toàn fb, zalo và các bạn của mình thì đang học đại học. Vì thế nên mình không còn ai để nói chuyện cả, và việc không giao tiếp với ai ngoài gia đình thực sự làm mình suy sụp. 1 số lúc thôi, nhưng lúc nó xảy ra mình không biết ứng phó thế nào. Rất căng thẳng, mình cảm thấy bản thân vô dụng, là 1 thằng ăn bám. Suy nghĩ của mình rất rối. Mình cần người để nói chuyện, tâm sự. Tuy nhiên mình lại nghĩ rằng làm thế để làm gì? Cũng không đạt tác dụng gì cả. Làm thế chẳng khác nào thừa nhận rằng bản thân yếu đuối, phụ thuộc vào người khác. Nó đến tự nhiên và cũng rời đi rất tự nhiên. Giờ tự nhiên mình thấy bình thường rồi. Chắc chỉ đơn giản viết ra suy nghĩ của bản thân là đỡ. Sao cần phải nhờ người khác khi tự giải quyết được nhỉ. Good luck brothers. 
 Tuy nhiên ai có cách hay thì cho vào đây nhé, mình sẽ rất biết ơn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been here for a a week now and as a solo traveller, Ive been enjoying the solo experience, I often go to eat alone, do activities alone and drink at bar and all sorts of stuff but I never feel lonely at all no ! 
 Don't get me wrong, there were moments were I want to share moments but it makes me appreciate humanity and people a lot more. 
 A lot of travellers and locals often become surprised at the fact that I just do things independently and tell me things like " I'm too scared to be alone" or " Aren't you scared?" Or " Where's your boyfriend?". 
 Scared of what ? Scared of not being able to be comfortable in my own skin? I'd be more afraid of that tbh! 
 The reason why I never feel truly alone or lonely is being I'm at a state of being where I feel content in the present moment, I want to soak it all up and enjoy the time I have here, I talk to people if I want to connect but I also have this freedom to also experience my inner world with the world outside of me and for the time I have here I want to be able to experience that.
 So for another question, what do the introverts or freespirits do here as well in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, just came back from a 2 week trip in VN and it was amazing. I had a few questions lingering from the trip on my mind, which I wanted to just hear discussion on.
 1) As title states, why is PQ so empty? It reminds me of a nicer Cancun/Cabo and the people are amazing. For some reason there was ZERO people at Grand World when we visited during the day and then it wasn't even that busy at night either. The shops seemed fake but they actually had workers when we went in so I'm still confused.
 2) Is tourism down in VN in general this year? Why is that? A lot of the Grab drivers were letting us hire them for the full day and we would just have to pay the Grab rates(or less) and they didn't charge at all for waiting time... (for example if we went to Grand World for 5-6 hours, he would just charge us for the ride there and back)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 My family and I are planning to visit Phu Quoc for a few days and I'm looking for the best transportation option.
 The problem is that motorbikes are not an option for 3 out of 4 of us for various reasons (older age, bad eyesight, and no driver's license). From what I've gathered, grab/other taxi services aren't that common around the island, and renting a car is impossible. But we'd still like to explore and move around and I'm getting a bit discouraged by the research I've done so far.
 Is there an option I haven't considered yet? Or, maybe my research is wrong? What would be the best transport option for the 4 of us around the island?

 Recently left Vietnam after back packing through it for 90 days; missing it already. In my last few days in Hanoi before flying out I redownloaded Pokemon Go just to see what's up, and on my last day there I caught a Beldum with perfect IVs.
 Now, I learned a little Vietnamese (mostly so I could order food in a restaurant from a Vietnamese menu) but I don't exactly have a wide vocabulary. I wanted to nickname that Beldum something Vietnamese and was wondering, for any pokemon fans here, if you have any good ideas for what you might nickname a Metagross.
 Otherwise I'm gonna be stuck calling the thing "Bánh mì", and it deserves better.

 Any suggestions for other tours or trips outside Hanoi? My parents are healthy but can't walk or climb steps for extended periods. We're more inclined towards natural scenaries and experiencing local culture than shopping.

I called our hotel in Hanoi and asked if we could courier our luggage to their hotel for 9 days and they said no. Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our son recently became friends with a Vietnamese boy in his class. We love him and his family, but his parents do not speak English (despite having lived in the US for several years). 
 Last week, our son had a birthday party and as a gift, they gave him a credit/debit card worth $100. We were flabbergasted. They do not seem like an overtly wealthy family: middle class house, etc. 
 We don't know what to do. We are uncomfortable with this gift, but unable to discuss it with them. Of course we would be very tactful if we could, just explaining that it is not the norm in this culture to give such an exorbitant gift. Since they do not speak English after living here for years, we thought perhaps they work in fields where they don't need to, and are thus sort of encapsulated in a cultural bubble? 
 Thoughts on this, and how we should approach it? 
 (Also: when they came to drop off/pick up their son from our house, they refused to come inside. Not even into the entryway. And it was cold outside, so I was standing there with the door open while we waited for the kids to come downstairs. I invited them several times. The only thing I can remotely think of is that we have cats, and maybe they're allergic?)

We were originally thinking 2 years would be the max, and then extend if we like it or move on if we didn’t. The job offer that was received was 3 years. The pay and benefits are good, but he wouldn’t get 2 days off in a row which puts a damper on traveling to other cities to explore. Just wondering what others thoughts are on living in HCMC for an extra year. Would you? Why or why not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never had real Vietnamese food before, but I found a small restaurant in my neighborhood recently and now it has become my favorite! I usually don't eat soups because I find them boring, like the classic veggie or chicken soup that almost everyone makes, or tomato soup, potato soup and so on. They're ok, kinda bland sometimes, but nothing special to me. 
 But the first time I tried Pho Bo, it just blew me away, the combination of flavors is just spectacular. Now whenever I go to this restaurant, I always start with a Pho Bo. Then I continue with other stuff like Bahn Mi, Bún chả and others that I forgot their name and struggle to pronounce them, but I'm trying to learn. I think it's good to learn their real names, it's a sign of respect and appreciation. 
 I also like that they're playing traditional Vietnamese music on speakers, I find it very relaxing. And the people there are also very friendly and hospitable, which makes the whole experience so much better.
 A huge thank you for all the food you bring to the world!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in Vietnam for a month now. Before, I had the impression that it isn't really an expensive country.
 I checked per capita income, it isn't much. 
 But everyone here has some expensive things that just don't make sense. 
 Everyone seems to have iPhone, that too - pro models. Many people here drive expensive cars. Even the grab cabs are relatively good cars.
 But accomodation, hotel stays aren't expensive. Food is fair priced.
 So it just doesn't make sense to me. - how much people earn here, on an average? - if people aren't earning much, how are they able to afford such expensive things? - what is normal mentality people have regarding finances and savings. Do they spend all they earn? - what is mentality on owning things? Why does everything have extensive phones and cars here?

 Not that it matters so much, but I’ve lived in Vietnam the past 20 years, can speak the language, etc. I’m not asking for an appeal to authority, but I have, in my view, earned the right to judge. 
 In terms of the most important parts of culture, Vietnam is a toxic mess that needs to grow up and figure itself out. Now let me qualify that. 
 When you get to know Vietnamese people, they are great. Some of my best friends are Vietnamese. People I would trust with my kids. They’re kind, gentle, caring, and generous. But this is a one-on-one thing. 
 Then there’s the public culture. When the cloak of anonymity drops and no one knows you, people are often vile and selfish. The noise, the littering, the way people drive, elevators, queui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve read a couple of posts/ comments on this sub about experiences of black people in Vietnam. One said that in Vietnam black people are thought to be, aggressive or dirty or unlucky and should expect racism, and not be treated like other tourists, i.e. in a welcoming way. I realise no country is free of racism (some are worse than others) but is it likely to be so apparent that it negatively impacts my experience of Vietnam? If so I would like some insight so I know what to expect.
 I’ve travelled to a handful countries in SE Asia most have friendly locals and I didn’t feel any different to any other travellers. Except in two-ish cases. One country was memorable for people handing me babies to take photos and basically being in a zoo like situation and in another I experienced constant racism, being called a ghost people whispering behind your back, not being served like other people in restaurants etc. The only place I was treated well in that country, was the hotel I stayed at. I plan on going back to the first country because as tiring as that became, after the novelty of being an instant celebrity wore off, the people were not inherently racist just not exposed and they were actually lovely people. The second I will avoid for as long as I can.
 I plan on making the most of this trip either way because I like to experience new places but some insight would be helpful so I can be mentally prepared. It’s a short trip so I’ll only be going to HCMC and Nha Trang. Apart from a few trips to areas near these places, I won’t be venturing anywhere else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey so have many of you guys run into these fake Facebook profiles of attractive Vietnamese women that add you as friends? Then they continue to get to know you and follow up advertising about teaching you crypto and are super pushy about it. I am always suspicious the moment they talk to me but let it play out. I never let it get past that part and just tell them to fuck off. However, I am curious where are they going with those scam? They waste so much time and energy and some of them straight up forget their humanity for the sake of trying to get some easy bucks. They also always pretend to be from Cali but I suspect they are from our homeland because I can’t imagine living in the US and using these dirty tactics to make a living. It is so shameful and embarrassing.

 I'm afraid of scammers that will ask for more money even if booking.com says it's free for me.

I have been to Thailand before but since my wife wanted the feel of it, I have included a week. Need suggestions if thats a good idea. Vietnam itinerary- Land in Hanoi on 12th Jan. 3 nights Hanoi/Ha Long and nearby 1 night in train/bus to Da Nang 2 nights in Da Nang 1 night in Hoi An or vice versa 1 night in train/bus to HCMC 2 nights in HCMC
 On 22nd Jan, flight from HCMC to Chiang Mai.
 2nights in Chiang Mai 1 night travel to BKK BKK to Phuket flight 2 nights in Phuket/Krabi Phuket to BKK flight 2 nights in BKK/Pattaya On 29th Jan, Monday, back to India.
 Thailand itinerary is not finalised yet just a rough thought on the above as on my previous trip I have already covered BKK, Pattaya, Phuket, Koh Samui and the full moon party. This trip was before Thailand legalised weed. I am also considering Thailand this time as both of us want to experience the weed culture now along with the new places like Chiang Mai, Krabi etc. Currently i have only booked the departure to Hanoi on 12th Jan, planning to book HCMC- Chiang Mai and BKK to delhi back, by tomorrow. Please help guide if I am doing the right thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We bought Viettel sim cards at the airport, assuming that any booths inside the airport were official stores. Our sim cards were simultaneously deactivated after 36 hours. We went to the official Viettel store in Hoi An, and she looked up the sim cards. She said that they were very old and that they were not registered on their network anymore. She also told us to only buy from an official Viettel store, and said that there are no official Viettel stores at Da Nang airport. We had to buy new sim cards (we paid 170k for 2 gigs a day for a month - less than the 240k we paid at the airport). Thankfully we paid with a credit card so we can dispute the charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Husband and I have just finished visiting the northern region of Vietnam, mainly Hanoi, Cat Ba and Ninh Binh. We are just blown away by this beautiful country and it’s people.
 There’s just so much to see and do in this beautiful country. Only being here for a few days we were so sad to leave but have so much appreciation for the hustle and bustle life of busy cities like Hanoi, as well as the calm and quiet lifestyle of those in Cat Ba.
 The variety of food options available here makes me so embarrassed as a westerner who had only heard about Pho. My favourite meal was when I had a local home cooked meal prepared by the wife of the caption who was taking us on a tour on Ha long bay. 
 Lastly, the people. I have never met such wonderful, accommodating and most admirably hard working individuals in any other place in the world. Some people on this sub say that people nag tourists to buy stuff, but I see that as them working hard to earn their keep. I just feel so much respect and admiration and ashamed at the times I have felt lazy to do my privileged job. 
 So grateful to have had this travelling experience in this beautiful country and can’t wait to be back.

 I'm wondering - where do they actually get all of the donuts? Like - what's the source? 
 The ones they try to sell / force onto me are always so old and stale, but I have a feeling that I'd really like the fresh ones, if I could find any. 
 Anyone know where they come from? Thanks! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just spent my evening at bui vien and absolutely heart breaking to see so many young children being sent out to sell items/blowing fire/begging. Being dragged around by parent or young siblings absolutely tired unable to keep eyes open. We even saw an infant no older that a month old being taken around the loud clubs with her begging mother. WHY is there not a ban in place for children to be on this PARTY street late in the evening?? Why are the vietnam govt allowing these children to be used in this way. I don’t know how people can enjoy there evening seeing the sad reality for these children. My heart breaks for them all.
 EDIT 
 i believe some people have taken this post in the wrong way. What I am wondering is if these children are being used by gangs etc why does the gov not try and minimise children being used in this way in main tourist areas etc

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not sure my English is correct. How much should women often “challenge” their Vietnamese partners for wedding?
 Introduction of myself: I am Chinese girl living in Hanoi. My sister and brother-in-law moved their factory here in 2018. I saw them having a good life here . They can afford having kids which is nightmare in China nowadays. So I decided to move and work here. I’m 24 years old, and it’s time to think about serious traditional relationship. My brother in law introduced me his Vietnamese customer. He’s a great and humorous guy. He’s running 3 clothes stores and online shops. We’re having good relationship and I think about marriage. In China, women’s families often expect wedding presents as cash from men. In my home province in China, it’s often 100000 cny (340 million vnd). I don’t expect the same amount in Vietnam. May be our tradition can be different. I’m curious how much I should expect from my future Vietnamese husband.
 I’m ready for marriage life here. My personal finance is good. And I improved my Vietnamese a lot. I can sing See Tinh well 😁. It’s very easy for Chinese to pronounce Vietnamese words.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I just found this forum and I'm kind of typing this in a rush because I'm pretty freaked out at the moment.
 I've been working as an English teacher in Vietnam for the past (almost) 2 months.
 My boss showed me a contract at the beginning but I never actually signed anything. I am trying to look for new work because she 'fired' me like a month ago?? But I've still been working for her??
 Basically, she told me at first that the company can't keep me because they can't afford teachers and I'm not good enough. But then she said I could stay at the accommodation while I find new work.
 Then when a new company showed interest, she told me I can't change over because I'll get the company in trouble? She explained that she has to cancel my visa first. The agent says I need a letter from my bo…]]></summary>

 Twice today, once in a beautifully quiet pho restaurant, sat down, then suddenly a huge coach outside and in they flocked accompanied with a shouting tour guide armed with a flag, table barged into, bag on the floor knocked over, coughing whilst walking past no hand over mouth, loud noise for the next miserable 20 minutes. Then later on the beach, all calm, and along come a huge flock of about 40 of them, walking literally right next to me even though there's so much space, yelling at each other. Wtf is going on?! Lol. Can Chinese people travel alone or in couples or is it a government rule by the ccp that they must travel in large flocks of minimum 50 and cause maximum impact wherever they go... Just curious.... Don't see any other nationalities travelling like this....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just came from Tokyo where I would sing karaoke and have a great time. It was fun. It was lovely. People bonding over music and enjoy life in karaoke bars/rooms in noisy areas like Kabukicho, far from residental areas.
 Just came back to Vietnam, a country that is the complete opposite of Japan in every way imaginable and I swear it sounds like someone is running a duck over with a lawnmower every time they pick up a microphone. I'm no Freddie Mercury by any means, but it has to be something in the water here making people tone-deaf.
 I just got to my girlfriend's house, she has been really sick for a week, and despite knowing that the neighbors have been playing karaoke nonstop. Extremely selfish? Yes. But, I'm currently listening to what sounds like a roadkill dying and I want to stab my eardrums out with chopsticks.
 How is this legal? In every other place I've ever lived, the police would shut this tragedy of a performance down asap. Is it the way the language sounds or are people supposed to sound like they're drowning when they sing? Can we get a petition going to forever ban karaoke machines within a 4km radius of any city?

 It feels uncomfortable to me and it looks unprofessional, but I've never complained about it. Should I neck massage my subordinates to fit in with the culture? lol I wonder how wives feel about this.

 My dad is currently very sick with terminal cancer and lives with me in Canada outside of Vietnam. He has a Sacombank bank account with a decent amount of money in it, but it’s “locked in” as it was an interest generating account. 
 Due to his illness, he will not be able to travel back to Vietnam to do any banking as he’s very sick. Is there anything we can do to unlock the account so he can move funds to our country (Canada)? He’s under the belief the banks need him physically there but he’s in nope shape to travel.
 Thanks!

 I am travelling to Vietnam for 5 days in the last week of January. We are group of 3/4 people and have short listed Ninh Binh and Hanoi as places to visit. We are landing in Hanoi, that’s why. Haven’t booked the tickets yet. 
 So, do you all think it’s wise to cover these two places in 5 days? We want to stay for at least 2 days in Ninh Binh as well not just one day tour there. 
 Would really appreciate your guidance on what places we should must go considering the short span of time in both cities. 
 Is it a wise decision to cover both places or should we stick to one place only? 
 Thanks for you help and suggestions in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I expected people to do research to know what to expect and today alone theres 2 posts about scam taxis in TSN. I get it, its a mess of an airport. Sometimes its a maze just to navigate so ill try to make it easier. I assume u have downloaded grab before the trip to SEA, and u can pay in cash.
 If u dont have any data, it is possible to ask your hotel to arrange transportation. Usually higher end places can do this. Somebody will hold a sign with your name at the arrival gate. Airport wifi kinda wacky sometimes
 If u arrive from international airport, once ur out of the airport, go across the street to the parking lot. There are prearranged Grab vehicles spots where they can pick u up. Book them and head there asap
 If u arrive from domestic, its a lil annoying but doable. Leave the domestic terminal and head to the building across, this is the parking building.
 parking building
 Head straight pass all the shophouses and little kiosks to the parking lot looking area
 ​
 Grab pick up area
 Grab's designated pickup area is on lane D1, from pillar a5 to l5. Book em and wait for em here.
 Do:
 - Turn on location on grab so the grab driver know where u are
 - Ignore all the trip or taxi sellers on the way
 - Keep an eye on exact pickup location. Grab gives u a range of pillar (ie d5 to j5). Stay at the right place so the driver can pick u up on time. They only have about 3 minutes
 - Check if its the right plate number, cant even tell u how many people forgot bout this
 DONT:
 - Take any taxis other than Vinasun or Mai Linh. Even for these 2 brands they tend to send "VIP" taxis that charge u at higher rate
 - Spend time listen to anyone dissuate u from taking ur booked ride for "cheaper". Tell em u had a ride and move pass em
 - Let ANYONE even touch ur wallet. Like tf??
 Airports are hotspots for scams, its like this for any country. Its the same shit outside of Charles de Gaulle or Beijing. Stay vigilant and enjoy ur trip

 The dog seemed alright, I think it was just being playful and saying hello in an untrained way but my gf is pretty worried that theres a chance she's going to get rabies and die. We've had the course of rabies injections before coming to Vietnam but it's my understanding that this doesn't give you full protection and the ability to ignore dog bites.
 We left the restaurant before being able to ask if the guys dog normally does this
 What do you guys think?
 We've just called the dog owner and he said the the dog has had a rabies vaccine
 Edit: Have gone to the hospital to have shots

Elderly cutting people in line whenever they see an opportunity and just people cutting in general
 
Pushing and shoving when waiting in line and no idea of people’s boundaries.
 
Fake pricing and trying to rip off people in general (rampant across Vietnam and in almost all market except the mall)
 
Trash everywhere
 
Lack of Public Utilities
 
Traffic is so chaotic and unsafe (Witness a deadly accident and a death of a motorcyclist in the three weeks that I’ve visited here)

 The first step stepping out of ho chi minh, the best economic city of vietnam, of its airport, the whole country's image is severely damaged. Totally no police patrolling and ensuring any passengers safety.
 I believe there are alot of good people in vietnam too, but the lack of law and safety is really bad, allowing scammer to roam freely.

 I am from China and watched it last week in Australia. Generally I enjoyed the show. The choreography, stage design, acting are all fantastic. There were some really impressive scenes to look at which are more powerful than a modern action movie could do. 
 The downside is that I did feel the extent of stereotype on Vietnamese/Communist characters is a bit glaring. I can understand it was written by French men during the cold war so we shouldn't be too harsh. I'm wondering how everyone here thinks about it.

 I have until the 29th before me evisa expires. I’m going to the embassy tomorrow. How much does a new passport cost? Can it be paid for with a credit card on an ereader? Banks are Wellsfargo and Chase. How quickly can banks usually get out a new card? I used my card on Grab to order a few meals and some water. I have 20,000 in dong.
 A total headache, my god. 😆 Any informed advice would be most appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[been in hanoi 7 days now, super surprised about how eager everyone seems to be to put tourists on motorbikes. feels like there’s a conspiracy to keep the hanoibus lines secret. they’re cheap and about as reliable as your average US urban bus. why aren’t they more often suggested? is it because Vietnamese people don’t want to share their public transport with tourists/foreigners? yes they’re slow, yes you detour, maybe these are good things that some tourists might actually want?
 anyway. after some stumbling about i finally figured out that if you put “xe <province name>” into google it’s pretty easy to find the regional bus routes, too, which i assume (perhaps foolishly?) won’t be much worse. 
 but here’s the thing. i sorta want to relive some version of my experience from 20 years ago on Java riding the indonesian version of “Xe khách dù” using only speaking knowledge of numbers, and before google. the only guide i found suggested they’d be impossible for foreigners to navigate, which seems ??? . uncomfortable, sure. absolutely no equivalent to anything “back home” in europe - 100%, correct. but “impossible?” really?
 we’re trying a regional bus tomorrow to one of the “craft villages” that all the guides say you should hire a taxi to get to (??). if that works then i think i would like to give a “Xe khách dù” a shot. 
 is this a terrible idea? will my presence on one will cause more upset or offence than curiosity or humour (including humour at my expense, “look at the stupid foreigner” kinda thing)?

 Obviously because he's on holidays I don't want to ruin his fun but at the same time I don't want to contribute to the problem (both morally and money wise) but I'm curious as to whether alcoholism is seen as a 'problem' in Vietnam? 
 I know the males in vietnam are very keen on nhau but I'm not sure if social attitudes see it as a problem. My wife is Fiji-Indian and she says in their culture its completely normal to have 5-6 beers a day, but this doesn't mean it isn't a problem. 
 Just wanted a different perspective to see how I can address this issue.

 I'm heading to Danang this December and hoping to try paragliding while I'm there. Can anyone suggest the best spots for paragliding that won't break the bank? The prices I've seen online are crazy – nearly $100 for one person! I'm sure the locals might have some better insights. It's more expensive than the 5-star hotel I'm staying at, which is pretty amusing! 😄
 Also, besides paragliding, I'd love recommendations for other fun activities in the area. Any local favorites or must-do experiences? Thanks a bunch!
 Edited: Moreover, Is this national park worth going with a tour guide or DIY should be fine? https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/11139-trekking-bach-ma-national-park-day-tour-hue/

 Firstly - it was absolutely magical: breathtaking views, wonderful local homestays, friendly locals & smiling children, and great food.
 Secondly: we were told it can't be done. We have no international driver's license. We were told nobody would rent to Americans. We were told laws were strict due to recent accidents and not to bother unless we did it via a group.
 For us - this all proved to be wrong. And because of these misperceptions - we didn't encounter a single American on our route (plenty of French/Chinese/Japanese/British/Australian/German people, though).

 The problem is that I am very short (160cm), very fat (130kg) and want to buy men's business shirts and maybe a men's suit.
 Are there any tailors who are used to dealing with short, fat tourists?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading a book recently that claimed Pol Pot planned to invade South Vietnam, and essentially try to take Saigon before the North Vietnamese forces arrived and restore the Mekong to Cambodia, which nationalists there historically claim. It didn't happen because of how unexpectedly quickly the RVN forces fell to the North, although Cambodian forces did briefly take Phu Quoc after the fall of Saigon before being expelled. And then ultimately crushed in 1978 when the battle-hardened Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia. 
 It got me thinking about what would have happened if he had invaded the much weaker South Vietnam, assuming it hadn't collapsed so quickly. Could he have pushed through to Saigon? Would China, who preferred to have Vietnam divided, have provided more support? Any good sources or alternate history places to read more?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story: my mom (Viet Kieu with no Vietnamese CCCD) gave my grandmother money to buy land and a house. So we spent monies on buying that land and built a house. 
 My grandmother died, then transferred that land title to my Aunt. Now that my mom retired to Vietnam, she has CCCD and Ho Khau. 
 We asked Aunt say to transfer land back to my mom's name, she refused. She gave a lame excuse like "Oh, when I die, I will put you on the will paper, transferring the land to you. Don't worry nobody will live in your house". (She has the red book, it means she could easily sell the land and house right?) 
 My aunt is a 60 year old, childless, never married woman.
 I have a video recording of the aunt admitting that my grandma gifting the land to my mom, and the whole village (it's small) knows that we bought the land and house 15 years ago. I have many aunts and uncles and nighebours that can be the witness, if that means anything in court.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just took a trip to Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. One thing I noticed, particularly in shops, cafes and restaurants is that while in the other countries (even hyper expensive Singapore), buildings were usually an arctic blast the moment you walk in, a lot of places in Vietnam often only have 1 AC unit running, AC set to a high temperature or areas of the premises partitioned off for "cleaning".
 I also noticed they usually just open the windows in the morning in spite of the noise, heat and pollution, waiting till the heat was unbearable before finally shutting the windows and turning the AC on and would sometimes turn off the AC 30 minutes or more before closing time. Is it really that expensive to run AC in Vietnam? . . Disclaimer - before the "all police" chime in, obviously not all Vietnamese businesses are like this and I'm sure they do this in other countries too but that besides the point.

 It only takes 5 minutes to complete and I would love to hear some perspectives on this issue, as that number is really low compared to countries like Thailand or Indonesia.

I have this job offer at a kindergarten which should keep me busy during the day for the most part, so I basically have the evenings and the weekend for myself. Is there much to do there? How long does it take to get to HCMC if I want to spend the weekend there, I am also big into swimming, are there any swimming pools that you can subscribe to? Food options etc. I applied your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! When my Uncle served for the US Army in Vietman, he was stationed in Nha Trang. His experience was far different than so many other veterans - he had a pretty good life while he was there and has been back to visit, in fact. He managed to get into a relationship with a local woman named Diep (out of respect I am not posting her full name) which he still reminisces of fondly to this day. He yearns to know that she is okay.
 Pics: https://imgur.com/shBetbb https://imgur.com/QinNwTP 
 This is a shot in the dark but I wanted to at least let my Uncle know that I shared his story. I also realize that she and many others may have had a completely different perspective of things. Apologies ahead of time but this is about their relationship, nothing else. He is getting very old and this is one of the last things that he's never gotten closure on. If you know or knew this woman, enjoy the pictures. If you wish to share anything about her, please do. I'll share them with him.
 Thank you. Be well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, lying contemplatively, I suddenly sat and pondered about charity. I looked at it from a different perspective.
 If there were no charity missions, would the children there not know about the existence of better food, nicer clothes? Most people know that charity is often organized with groups going to remote areas for a few days, cooking, providing clothes, books, and supplies, and then everyone goes back home.
 The children/people in those areas get to eat 'okay' for a few meals, and then it goes back to reality as usual. So, does charity bring any meaning to the people there? Or is it a way for the children to see themselves as 'poor' compared to society? So, if there were no charity, or if they didn't go on social media to see others 'flexing', would their lives be less self-conscious?

However, there's no actual flight ticket anywhere to be found! The Vietjet website FAQ section seems to imply a second email with the tickets should've been sent out with the booking confirmation but I've never received this. If I use my booking number on the Vietjet website to retrieve my booking details it only shows me my flight itinerary, no ticket.
 Has anyone had this experience with Vietjet before? I know it's a budget airline and it's got it's money saving ways (read: scummery) but I'd still love to hear any advice.

 Example: do la mot chiec vậy đẹp. that is a beautiful skirt. 
 Quyền sach nay đặt tiền. This book is expensive. 
 Ban co thích cứ a hang nay khong? Do you like this store? 
 So basically I’m asking when is it nay and do la. Is this just something to remember or is there a grammar vocabulary thing I should work on to help transition my learning. 
 Cảm ơn VN and Reddit ❤️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello ! I will be in Vietnam for a solid two weeks for a student program. It will be in the beggining of March! I'm of course really excited to get to know Vietnamese culture, to get a taste of a bit of everything. 
 But aside from my excitement, the beggining of March is also the start of Ramadan, holy month for us Muslims. Since I'll be fasting and all, I would like to know how Muslims are perceived by the rest of the Vietnamese population. I saw that there are a lot of mosques, but maybe people don't perceived it very well you know? So I rlly want to know from you guys! Thanks a lot!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone
 My friend and me were remniscing and joking today about our Vietnam trip that we made almost 10 years ago.
 During the discussion we came upon the subject of hearing those generic beats and basslines of those Vinahouse tracks being played loud af in random shops in Southern Vietnam.
 You know, these famous "DUN - DUH DUH DUH - DUN" beats. 😂
 And during the discussion, we asked ourselves if there is an actual original song or remix that started it all.
 In that article here...
 https://danangleisure.com/vinahouse-in-a-nutshell-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-it
 ... there is the mention of a remix of a song called “Tình phai” by DJ Hoàng Trọc and DJ Alan Tian, that apparently initiated the birth of the genre.
 I searched for that particular remix here and there, but I couldn't find anything.
 Does anyone know a hint or could point us to a specific song or remix? I am aware that Vinahouse songs are pretty much always just a silly remix of some other song, but there HAS TO BE ONE specific remix or track that started it all??
 I think of something like in that particular video here:
 https://youtu.be/_Zd46k_Z02M?si=5KbNSOsTXf-2l7oH
 Thanks to all you legends!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we're planning of travelling to Hanoi in December and doing an excursion to Hạ Long Bay area. We can plan to either do a 2 day 1 night cruise but typically these finish at midday and then travel back to Hanoi. Does anyone have any recommendations for trips that are 2 day 1 night but only travel back to Hanoi around 4/5 pm so make the most of the 2nd day? We are unable to do a 3 day 2 night trip as our flight is very early on the 3rd day.
 Alternatively does anyone know what cruises we can do that drop off at Cat Ba island on the 2nd day and we do our own thing before heading back to Hanoi? I believe the last boat/bus back is at 4pm, but please tell me if there are other later options for returning to Hanoi.
 Any any recommendations on if to do Lan Ha Bay/Cat ba island instead of Hạ Long Bay?

 I went to Vietnam a few years ago and bought a snow globe shaped like this building because it was so beautiful. But when I look back and remember, I can't remember what this building was.

 ![img](i6pmivydq31c1 " ")
 Mới vụ gần đây có một tiktoker bị bóc phốt vì nói lớ tiếng việt. Căn bản là bạn này sinh ra ở Việt Nam nhưng sống ở Mỹ cũng được nhiều năm. Mới gần đây, bạn ấy có đăng một vài video trong đó bạn nói tiếng Việt có bị chậm. Không biết là ai ném đá trước nhưng sau một thời gian thì có nhiều Tiktoker khác bu vào chửi bới và khinh bỉ rằng OOP giả bộ không biết Tiếng Việt để tỏ vẻ Mỹ Trắng.
 Lúc đầu thì mình cũng ngỡ ngàng tại vì mình sống nước ngoài cũng khá lâu. Mình chưa bao giờ tiếp xúc với người Việt gốc nào giả bộ nói lớ tiếng Việt để “làm màu”. Những comments mình đọc được thì cũng nhiều thành phần nói thẳng ra là vô cùng vô văn hoá và thiếu suy nghĩ. Bao nhiêu người, già hay trẻ, xô vào để cấu xé cô gái có 22-24 tuổi làm vài video giải trí trên mạng. Rồi nhiều Tiktoker còn tự chế thông tin kêu là bạn này mới qua được một năm, bạn này bắt chước hoa hậu nào đó cũng bị lớ giọng sau khi học nhiều thứ tiếng. Thật sự là mình hơi ngạc nhiên khi thấy tình trạng bóc phốt bây giờ nhỏ nhặt đến mức chỉ nói lớ tiếng Việt là ăn chửi. Liệu Tiktok VN bây giờ có thô thiển quá mà chỉ toàn “The Drama”, kiếm nạn nhân để mà chửi câu view hay không?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a white guy travelling slowly by train and stopped in a small station called Bong Son 80km north of Quy Nhon then went 15km north with a taxi. There's obviously very little tourism there especially westerners so at least 1/3 of people say hello or ask questions, kids come running to me etc but mostly positive encounters.
 Of course some laugh at me because I'm a 185cm dude on some tiny multicolor bicycle I got from my hotel roaming the dirt roads but I don't mind.
 But today I was cycling at this spot https://maps.app.goo.gl/WJqaow9SXyUgEGic9 and a young guy around 16yo on a scooter stopped me in the middle of the road and was quite angry for some reason. Couldn't speak a word of english and I can't speak vietnamese. He left after maybe 2 minutes so I kept going the same way (down south to get to a creek) and he turned back, turned again and was behind me and gave me a kick with his foot in the back of my bicycle.
 I realised he certainly didn't want me to go that way for some reason so I turned back and I didn't see him again.
 Any idea what happened there ? It's not like there were house nearby or I was in a private property.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow what can I say, it's been 18 years since I've been here, I came here when I was 12 and when bird flu was an issue. It's so incredibly different, for context, I'm Vietnamese Australian and being here made me fall in love with the life here, although maybe that's idealistic but living in a western society for so long made me realise how deeply problematic the social system and dynamic are, it might work for some and it might not work for others but I love it here, btw this is my first solo trip and well... So far here's my experience, the ho Chi Minh song from vietjetair is stuck in my head, I feel a deep sense of pride for him even though I wasn't born here,I oddly comfortable here, I ate Banh mi Huynh hoa, I spoke to the locals, I got scammed but hey it's all experienced so I'm not mad, just a little disappointed but hey it's life. People are helpful, willing to help.
 So I guess this probably a very adventurous start, and a big welcome to Vietnam. Wow, that's day 1 anyway till I post again, next flight Hanoi !
 If there is anything fun to do and awesome food/drink to try, please let me know !

 My concerns are:
  
air quality
 are there bike paths along those rivers where I can exercise
 can I rent a decent size apartment (over 40 sq. meters) within walking distance for under 1000 USD (prefer a bit lower).
  
I have never been to Vietnam but have only heard good things about living and working there. 
 Please feel free to comment or advise.

Arriving in Hue on 21st and leaving Da Nang for Ho Chi Minh on 29th but because the current flooding in Hue we were wondering whether to completely skip central Vietnam and just go to the south. Do you think it's ok to go there still or should we miss it?
 My main concern is the flooding but also will it be mainly raining whilst we're there too? 
 Are Hoi an and da Nang impacted by the floods? And is transport still possible?
 In which case thinking of spending more time in the south.
 Recommendations from people locally are really appreciated or have been before!

We enjoy nature and calm but also maybe a place with a couple bars where we can meet people and also some nice cultural events. We were thinking somewhere north and we are not sure if we are going to stay very long in the south because of the hot weather. ( We like the cold!) Eventhough our flight back home will be leaving from Ho Chi Minh City. We are in Hanoï right now and we are craving for a place much less busy and quieter (we have been in cities for the past 3 weeks). It can also be in center Vietnam, we were thinking of being there at the end of December / beginning of January. Thank you for you advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I am a 27M from Western Europe but living in Korea since 2 years.
 I was recently contacted by a Korean giant company to work in Vietnam on a more leadership role than what I do now.
 Everything seems great for now however when going across the recruiter's profile I could see that they offered 30M/month on this job.
 As I don't know anything about Vietnam or their currencies, I checked the change and I was surprised to see that it was not even meeting the mininmum wage in my home country.
 I understand that economy and buying power may be different in Vietnam, however I am bound to travel a lot (Home country, Korea, SEA...).
 Because it seems so low, I was wondering if it was a scam or a possible mistake, or if it is a normal and decent salary in Vietnam.
 Edit : The job would be in Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu
 Edit 2 : I got a lot of answers, thank you for your reactivity !
 As far as I know, this is not a scam - I got contacted on LinkedIn and everything is linked to this worldwide korean company, including the job listing.
 As a LinkedIn expert myself having done a lot of recruitment, you can't usurpate identity and pretend to be from another company while posting a job.
 I didn't receive details about the salary yet. I just found the 30M information on the recruiter's profile.
 Thanks to you, from my understanding it may be great for a local but not for an expat. Let's hope their package is evolving if they want to hire an expat, or let's pray that they forgot a number !
 Thank you

 Just finished a 7 days motorcycle tour in Ha Giang that started and ended in Hanoi.
 I've never seen a more scary place than Hanoi and surrounding area from a pollution, crowded and garbage perspective.
 The 70 km from Thai Nguyen to Hanoi I felt like I'm riding through the end of the world. 
 You cannot see the sky and buildings afar from pollution, over industrialization that pollutes every living thing, garbage everywhere.
 In the city sitting in traffic between a mass of cars, trucks emitting black smoke and scooters I felt like I'm going to pass out.
 Absolute hellish experience. Probably my first and last time in that city.

 I am an amateur photographer (website here for reference) and am very interested in photographing the fishing villages around Da Nang and Hoi An--more particularly Hoi An where I anticipate heading to after landing in Da Nang. I would like to photograph fisherman with their nets out on the water but also people mending/storing nets in the villages. Stylistically, this would be very similar to Réhan's work with fishing villages.
 I am looking for recommendations on where near Hoi An (or Da Nang) people fish. I understand there is some fishing right of Cua Dai beach. Would hiring a boat on the Thu Bon river allow for easier viewing of fisherman?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi, so my parents are ethnic chinese, born and raised in vietnam, the family needed to flee south vietnam late 70s early 80s
 i really did not understand what the vietnam war actually was about til i got older cause through their lense it was mainly „well the communist were shit and evil towards us“ but they did not mention too much the american army. so i grew up thinking „well these communist folks were super bad“ (and „communist“ was used interchangebly with „north vietnamese“). also, grew up pretty western, so the evil communist narrative is kinda norm.
 at some point, a couple of years ago i watched this long documentary series called „vietnam“ by us-american documentary filmmaker ken burns, and for me, it was a very significant turning point cause now all the „evil communist“ had faces, their story, their motive. that being said, of course i knew the narrative of my parents are by no means universal. but you know, that was basically the only story all your life.
 however, i never knew that this war was so incredibly complex, not only since the beginning of the american engagement. for me the documentary doesn‘t seem to biased, on the contrary, it reveals alot of the american misjudgment and bad (and dare to say, evil) decisions. 
 how do you guys perceive the documentary? do people in vietnam know this movie? what effect did it have on you, if you‘ve seen it? genuinely interested in some thoughts

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context I’m Hoa— but I speak Viet and Mandarin (from university) mostly. But I recently had to finish a paper and thinking writing about Viet would be probably easy. I ran across the work of Mark Alves, a linguist who basically reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of Vietic language. And I started to realise how Vietnamese really kinda stands on its own as being a SouthEastern and East Asian language. I don’t why but this was my shower thought about why there is so much Chinese built within Vietnamese language.
 I noticed in his work there was a lot of old Chinese (and of course other dialects and Chinese words over history) still used in Vietnamese. I had a weird shower thought that Vietnamese language seems like a sponge for Chinese language, if they didn’t have an existing word for it they just take it from their big neighbours. And I think hearing from my family about colonialism isn’t the whole story why there’s so many words adopted. I’m curious about if anyone knows if there are studies on this.

 I am a so called "Việt kiều" in my early 20s. Born and raised in America. I have been back to Vietnam 4 times since I was 12, with the most recent trip being about a month ago. It was the first time coming back as a grown adult, so I did and saw a lot more. It was the most memorable trip of my life.
 Returning to America, I feel my life is boring. I don't have many friends, and I hate my job. It felt weird to have to return and live in a country that is so quiet and...sterile in comparison. We have a Viet community here in my state, but it pales in comparison to Texas, Cali. I miss Vietnam so much, I am considering getting a 90 day visa and returning before Tết, living off of savings. I have family who are more than happy to accommodate me, but I also want to rent a place for a mon…]]></summary>

 During my last trip to south east Asia I visited Vietnam and, of course, I fell in love with the Country.
 I also really enjoyed Hoi An and its charm, and I had the opportunity to get some tailored suits (of course) and to buy some leather items such as wallets, keychain, etc.
 I bought the leather stuff in a store called Da Bao, which I tried to send some email to see if they can do international shipments. But unfortunately I had no replies. 
 So my question to you guys is, can you recommend a good store who can do it? (of course non strictly from hoi an).
 Cảm ơn!

 Out of several 500,000 VND bills, one of them is slightly torn. I took a picture of the ATM and the ATM number and information on it.
 Have been here before in the past they made a big deal about a slightly torn and 200,000 VND note, and would not take it.
 According to this law site, it states any bank per the law needs to replace a ripped bill, however, and practice does this work? Or should I just tape it and try to use it somewhere? The tear is maybe 4-5mm on the bottom of the note.

For money that is not eligible for circulation as stipulated in Clause 2 Article 4 of this Regulation, the above units shall receive and consider exchanging with the conditions specified in Point a, b Clause 2 Article 6 of this Circular. If the conditions for money exchange are not satisfied, these units shall return the money to customers and give a notice of the reason thereof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I caught the night train down from Hanoi last night. We hit massive flooding just outside Hue (Quang Tri) and stopped at 7am. 
 We haven’t moved since. We can’t get off the train, and we’re not being given any information by the staff, or the tourism company the train service is with. There’s not much food or water, and the staff are hiding from us. 
 I’m starting to get quite worried and stressed. Does anyone know when the floods will recede? Or could we be stuck here on the train until the weekend or longer? We’re scared we will run out of food and water and power soon. We definitely won’t move until morning now. 
 We would get off and try to find a car to take us back north, but it’s dark and too risky, we don’t know the situation out there. 
 Please stay safe everyone in the region!
 Edit: woke up. We’ve still not moved. We’ve been on the train for 36 hours+ now. It’s still raining heavily. My boyfriend is starting to get sick and is coughing with no water. We’re starting to get very sad and scared. We haven’t seen any staff members for 10+ hours. We’re not at a station so can’t get off. We’re on a ‘tourist carriage’ so no Vietnamese to ask for help. We’re ‘safe’ physically from the rain, and I’m grateful for that, but I’m so fed up of not knowing. At this point, we just want to fly back home from what was meant to be our dream trip. I feel so, so guilty for suggesting we take the train 😭 
 Edit 2: staff has abandoned us. We cannot find them. We have had news and no supplies for 12+ hours. Everyone is leaving the train and trying to escape now. We know it’s not safe, but we will also risk leaving now while it’s still light and the rain has stopped for a while. We will try to get to Dong Ha, then go north.

 I don't think the waters are going to clear out overnight so I'm better off going now vs struggling tomorrow?
 What do you guys think is the best course of action?
 I probably have to find higher ground then flag down a cab or book a grab to the airport? I'm guessing I can wash up there and wait overnight for my flight.
 I have a friend flying out tonight, she's heading to Saigon. I will just checkout today despite paying till tomorrow. Is there food available at HUI Airport?
 Edit: was trapped in the hotel, the staff had locked up the doors and abandoned us. Absolute bizarre experience but turns out it was tied up.
 Untied and made it to the streets before a boat picked up us. Currently staying at a homestay just a km away from the airport.

 Lively but not too loud
 No sketchy scenes (no overt drug use)

 Ive arrived yesterday in Vietnam (Hanoi) yesterday for the first time. Unfortunately, I learmed when I arrived at the airport that my checked bag has not made it through with me. I was lucky enough to have pack my most expensive item with me (just in case you know...) But now I'm left without clothes and over the counter medications (tynenol, gravol, Imodium, ...).
 I have been trying to find places to buy back some stuff in Hanoi today that are legit and provide receipt. While I was able to get some medications I'm Pharmacity in Hanoi. I've not been able to find legit places to get basic clothes with receipt. I went to a mall that have Amerian brands to try to find something that is not a random store in the street but realized that there is only men's clothes and everything is well overpriced aven comparer with Canada. 
 Do you know a good place to go to shop for essentials, most importantly shoes but also shorts, pants, shirts where they give receipt and prices are ok? My itinerary '/reservation are to go to Cat Ba and Nin Ninh in the next day but I doubt I'll find something there. I'm very lost at this point so I'm ok going back to Hanoi of required.

 I've stayed here for a bunch of years now and I always had a gaming PC with me. Every house/apartment I've lived in, my PC case or peripherals like microphone or any metallic parts will discharge a painful static shock to the part that touches my person. 
 I've checked online to make sure I did everything within my control, things like no carpet under the CPU, new power cables, quality extension plugs and no stray exposed cables touching the case. 
 Wall plugs here doesn't have the 3 hole option so that's telling me something is not grounded hence the shocks. 
 If it helps, my microphone gives out a permanent static white noise with or without my voice activating the microphone, tested by using the "listen to this device function. 
 Questions: 
  
Should I change my PSU? 
 
Should I call the electrician to come and ground my house properly (I recently built a new house)? 
 
Are there any work arounds for those who experienced the same problem? 
 
Gamers with gaming laptops, do you get shocks from your laptops while its charging? (I am seriously considering getting a laptop because of this problem but I am unsure if it makes any difference because of the lack of grounding) 
 
 Any help is greatly appreciated!

 My brother, nephew and I are going to HCM in January. We are staying near the Bui Vien street and this is no hate towards tourists like we are, but it's also nice to experience the 'real nightlife' like the locals experience it. 
 All three of us are happily in a relationship right now, so it's not about 'hunting' girls. It's all about having a good time in a bar or club. Something different than Bui Vien (or something located on Bui Vien but not really tourist-heavy). Do you guys have some tips and tricks for us three?

 It seems like I may be going to Vietnam sometime in December 2023/January 2024. I am still waiting for e-visa to be approved. What will the weather be like there at around this time? Is there any trains going in/out of the different cities? I ask because I tried googling it and it gave me nothing. 
 This is my first time in Vietnam. We will be flying in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), I have no itinerary right now, but what do you recommend visiting from Saigon, mostly day trips or a night or two stay overs? And share any other information you want. 
 I am super excited to be visiting, if I do end up going. Many thanks in advance.

 On the shoulder of a road, there was a truck. On the loading area, numerous crates were filled with dogs. In each crate, there were so many dogs that they were stacked on top of each other. Some of the dogs were trembling, utterly frightened, or not moving at all. I suspect some of them were already dead.
 I presume these are stray dogs that have been captured. But what is done with them? Are they taken somewhere and killed? Is that even legal? If they are killed, why are they subjected to such cruelty first? Not to mention, I don't find killing them acceptable.

 Bit of a weird/obscure one but a while back I saw a video about a banh mi place in Saigon (possibly elsewhere but 99% sure). Their main speciality was a huge banh mi with beef short rib as the meat, they put it on the roll with the bone still in and then pull the bone out.
 I'm flying into Vietnam for the 7th time later this week and was hoping to try this place but have lost any record of it and can't find it anywhere. Hoping someone here may be familiar with it and can help.
 If it helps, they also offered a few more different/fancy banh mis including a seafood one with caviar. It wasn't one of the $100 banh mis or anything, was about 3-400K or so and big enough to feed 2 people.

This concept of jumping on a bike behind a stranger and letting them drive you on a freaking bike scares the shit out of me 😅 How does it even work - do you hold/hug them from behind or how do you hold? Isn't the helmet they give you super gross from all previous passengers who leave their sweat there? Is it even safe to use?
 Those are genuine questions, not a rant 🙂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to rant here because this happened on a VietJet flight, but I’ve noticed other Asian airlines have the same stupid rules.
 The 7kg cabin baggage limit doesn’t make any sense! It’s supposed to be the combined limit for the carry-on and the personal item, but both are usually over this limit. Any carry-on under 7kg would be mostly empty. 
 I don’t care if an airline wants to make more money and charge more. They can certainly do so, but they should have reasonable rules and clear prices.
 I just had a bad experience checking in to a VietJet flight where the employe made me empty my carry-on and put half of the things in my big bag and half in my backpack. They checked in my big bag which was now slightly over the 20kg limit and my almost empty carry-on. They kept telling me to make my backpack lighter, but it was that heavy because of my laptop, iPad and battery pack which can’t be checked in because they contain lithium batteries. I kept asking them what to do, but even they didn’t know the solution and eventually just let me go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[👋 hello. American looking for authentic cha gio here in the states. Specifically, many Vietnamese restaurants use egg-based (yellow) roll wrap paper and not the clear, white rice paper. I was always told that the yellow one was the Chinese way of making them, and that proper cha gio were made with the clear ones. (Is this true?) Personally, I prefer the clear white wraps 100% of the time. I’m disappointed when I order cha gio in a restaurant and I get the yellow kind. Does anyone know how I can ask what kind of paper they use and what answer reflects my preferences? Will a Vietnamese restaurant look at me sideways for even asking?
 Thanks!
 Background: American, but my (White) grandmother was born and raised in Vietnam. Our family has since adopted some Vietnamese dishes as part of our family culinary traditions, including thit koh, bun thit, and cha gio. Looking to maintain those family traditions in the way I was taught. 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my bros and I are all legally blind. We still work out and like to party and eat out and stuff, so the other day we went to our favorite neighborhood spot for some grub. There were about 30 of us, and although we can’t see a thing, we have excellent hearing and some of us speak English.
 So we were seated around various tables and we heard this foreign guy seeming to have a great time with his female friends. There were all just chatting and we figured out that he was gay and they were out having a “ladies day” of sorts. He was joking around with them and gossiping like one of the girls. He kept saying stuff like “no betch” and “that’s right girl, he ain’t all that”.
 Then we heard the sound of another foreigner and he also sounded effeminate. He seemed to be trying to flirt with the first guy. The first guy suddenly pretended to be all macho and changed his voice. We were like bruh.
 We heard what sounded like hands grabbing plump body parts and we heard some kissing. Then the other gay guy got even madder and was saying stuff like “you know you don’t like them, you big faker” and then we heard footsteps storming off.
 So we all just chuckled and went on with our meal. You hear a lot of wacky stuff around here if you just stop to listen

 Out of the corner of my eye, observed what appeared to be an ethnically Malaysian tourist, a “brownie” smiling cheek-to-cheek, sitting with these very attractive and somewhat scantily, but not unusually dressed Vietnamese females, but thought nothing of it as one of them was my cousin, Trang, and the other two, knew from the High School karaoke club and the local Kung Fu dojo, as one of the other girls was a well accomplished martial arts champion.

We took him for something to eat before we go back to his hotel since we were quite a bit hungry. Although a bit drunk, he agreed. While eating, he was a bit handsy so we wanted to finish the meal quickly so we could get back to the hotel and do the deeds. 
 Out of nowhere, this tourist confronted our John, and said that he should stop. He made a big scene and everyone was looking at us. We thought the tourist was going to get into a fight with our John, so instead of it escalating, me and my girls just paid for the food and got out of there ASAP. 
 ​
 Guys, how do I avoid situation like this? Do I get handsy myself on the John so that tourist don't think that I'm being kidnapped?

I was minding my own business and having fun with three other Viet women. They were like 45 kilograms of chicken these women. The women were enjoying themselves with the drinks I was buying. I was balling out with these 45 kilogram chicken and they were loving it. Then all the sudden this crazy tourist comes over trying to be a hero and tell me to take my hands off the product. I ignored him as I paid for these women, so I kissed them. He said something again about me touching the woman. So I grabbed the women again to piss him off and kissed them as well. The guy looked miserable. Like he had come to vacation with his wife and mother in law. He was jealous as I left my wife and mother in law at home. Why would you bring that kind of sand to the beach? There is plenty of sand here to play with. Any how, the women were having fun and enjoying my company. These tourist should mind their business just like I was. We are some hard working men from Malaysia here for some R&R. These type of tourist confuse me. Are they here to vacation and have fun or play some fantasy superhero? If the women were in trouble they could scream or call the police. There was plenty of people around and we were all having fun. 🤩 Enjoy life my people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a fun story I wanted to share, no offense to anyone who digs the style I‘m going to talk about.
 My dad migrated from Vietnam 30 years ago and what striked me almost my whole adolescent life was his particular style of clothing. Like everything has a luxury brand name on it. All in all it it’s this kind of „young money“ street style from 2010. Sunglasses, caps, LV satchel, expensive watch, you name it, paired with buddhist accessories. From a fashion standpoint it’s completely randomly combined. This stands out even more since no other 60 year old man dresses this way in the country I grew up in. Though I’d say especially migrant groups tend to do that as well as a status symbol though there‘s something, besides the jade bracelets and stuff, that makes it so different and I really can‘t say what.
 And then, in 2019, I visited Vietnam for my first time. And when I walked around Bui Vien street or took the local busses, I’ve seen other middle aged men that radiated some thuggish ominous vibe like bouncers and I realized They wear the same outfits!! I don‘t know what exactly made it so similar but the composition of their outfits reminded me immediately of my dad. I had the feeling they wore even more accessories like a watch but also a jade bracelet and a wooden pearl bracelet on the same arm. It‘s so weird hahaha but now I know, where he got that inspiration from

She is from vietnam and started a successful nail salon in the United States with her family. I was chatting with her and I said the acetone solution looks like Kool aid and she said she doesn't know what Kool aid is and has never had it. As gross as it may sound to some Kool aid was a big part of my life growing up and while I don't drink it in adulthood since its not the best for you I still love it. Would it be rude for me to bring her some? Unopened obviously. I feel like it may come across as rude or making fun of her and that is NOT my intention. I'm posting this here because I'm unaware of the nuances in Vietnamese culture surrounding gift giving and such. The last thing I want to do is offend her.

 Someone said this one is one of the hardest climb in Vietnam. Is it possible to do this for 2 days and 1 night instead of 3?

 The girls looked much younger than the guy but he was really handsy with them. He then grabbed the head of one of them and then force kissed her right on the mouth. He started laughing in the happiest way and then kissed the other two girls in the same manner.

I’ll be staying at an airbnb and have been asked for my passport pic by the owner to show to the police? is crime very rampant there?
 Also what are some must go and no go in Hanoi? I’ll be taking a daytrip to Halong bay too so I guess it’s more of a 3d2n trip in Hanoi.

I also understand that the death penalty is carried out by firing squad. Can anyone enlighten me on this please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I rented an apartment from VXH, a government high ranking manager, possibly some general. The apartment is in Mipec complex, Hà Đông, Hà Nội. When I vacated the place, he visited the place and confirmed that he will return the deposit. He carried on my duty to pay the bills and lèa the house. Later on, he also replied a message to return the money on Oct 12. However, it has been a month since, and he has not returned the deposit. He refused my phone calls and never reply his reason not to return the money. Since sueing or asking for money is potentially problematic, I want to ask. 1. is it ok to ask his friends/wife/people at his place for his whereabouts? 2. how to sue now that I left Hà Nội and can't return. Would the government office, whatever that handles the case request me to be in Hanoi to carry on with the case? I also have heard that his wife works in the court and this will most likely thrown out. So how to make sure that the case will go. 3) there are many laws, on of which is the notorious 331 that puts people in prison for supposedly defamation of character. Their law in defamation of character is not like in the States - I have no profit or ill intention to do this beside getting my money. So how to avoid this?

 Hey, I'll spend 3 weeks in vietnam with my gf in march/april and we're staying in Nha Trang for 6 days. She really liked this hotel but something feels off. Some comments on booking are a bit weird and I can't find much on google, but it's on booking so... Anyone knows anything about it? 
 Otherwise, any recommendations for a good resort/hotel in Nha Trang, Tuy Hoa or around that area? Nha Trang is where I'm ok spending money on accomodation since it's the only place where we'll actually spend time at the hotel/resort, so I'm looking for one of those 5 stars with amazing buffets, pools and all that. 
 Any other recomendations regarding Nha Trang and its surroundings are welcome :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around 9:30 PM tonight, November 11, 2023, I was passing through the Kim Liên tunnel, Hanoi, Vietnam. I was on the back of a fast-moving motorbike when I randomly looked up at the sky and saw many flashing, color-changing circles like these. These are original videos and ones that have been made to slow motion so you can see everything in different speed. At first, I thought they were lights from a crane on a high-rise building, so I looked away. But a few seconds later, I looked up again and wondered “what? hold on…” how there could be such a high building in the sky! I tried to take a photo but couldn't because the bike was moving too fast, so I recorded videos instead. It looked very surreal and strange in person. I've never seen anything like this before. Did anyone else passing by that area tonight look up and see the same thing? Could these be drones? Can anyone explain what this might be?

Khi tôi dọn đi đã bàn giao nhà đàng hoàng, và trả toàn bộ tiền điện nước dịch vụ, có xác nhận. Chủ nhà cũng hứa sẽ trả tiền cọc 8tr ngày 12/10. Căn nhà thuê ở chung cư Mipec, Quận Hà Đông. 
 Nhưng đến giờ thì ông ta vẫn chưa trả và không trả lời tôi. 
 Tôi không biết một cán bộ quân đội, sợ cái gì, mà không thể trả lời. 
 Không muốn trả hay bất cứ lý do gì thì ông ta cũng trả lời tôi một tiếng được. Chẳng lẽ một người lính lại không có dũng khí để nói ra được điều mình muốn. 
 Tôi chỉ muốn ông ta trả tiền, hay chí ích là trả lời. 
 Mà đòi thế nào cho hợp lý với ông cán bộ cấp cao này.
 1) đòi tiền thế nào trong khi ông ta không hợp tác? Nếu tôi nhắn tin đến gia đình người thân ông ta, chỉ để hỏi ông ta ở đâu, tôi cần kiếm để hỏi vụ cọc thì có được không?
 2) nếu kiện cáo thì khi triệu tập tôi có nhất thiết phải gặp không? Tôi không có ở HN, và ông ta thì ở HN.
 3) làm sao để tránh cái tội nhục mạ, khi bản chất việc lấy tiền của người khác là nhục, mà đòi tiền thì nhắc đến cái nhục đó?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When a foreign traveler first sets foot in unique Vietnam, they are immediately shocked by the bustling and intricate traffic scenes. Especially in major cities like Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, the streets of Vietnam are a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds, where thousands of vehicles move incessantly. Foreigners may be surprised to witness the sight of motorcycles – the dominant mode of transportation in Vietnam – gliding smoothly through narrow streets, sometimes carrying an entire family or towering loads of goods. Alongside these, leisurely bicycles, creatively crafted homemade vehicles, traditional ‘Xích lô’, and even large trucks jostle together, creating a multi-hued tapestry of urban life.

 My aunties would all be waiting until 5am so they can drive them home LOL 
 Near the end of the night, my uncle's would fight eachother too and someone would go home with a black eye, the next week they come back, it's all good hahah wth.

 We are currently planning a Pacific tour and thinking of stopping in Vietnam on our route.
 Do you guys know of any cool venues. Something like an old theater or converted church is ideal for us. A capacity between 150 and 300 is ideal. Looking forward to visiting your beautiful country, and if you have any insider tips, please let us know!
 Thank you.

 Visiting Hanoi for 2-3 weeks, and my partner and I are interested to meet some other artists. We're in video game design, music, and videography. Any recommendations for where we could find live music or any sort of a scene related to the above? Limitation is that we don't speak Vietnamese, so I understand if that might be quite hard at a deeper level.
 Similarly, what part of town would fit us best? We've both travelled a lot, and don't need the coddling of having a boulangerie and pizza parlor within arms reach at all times.

I’m more interested in nature scenes and not a big city person, so a day in Hanoi is probably enough for me. The tour would have us stay the first night in Ninh Binh and then drive us to Ha Long the next day and stay overnight on a cruise. I read here that booking might be cheaper in the quarter but I’m not sure where to find them or which tour we should go with? I saw one online for $250 each which isn’t cheap. Would they also charge extra for water and other necessities? And would it feel too rushed to do this tour?

 We are always accused of racism, but when I talk to my parents, grandparents or other older people and ask them about Vietnamese people in the GDR, I only hear great acknowledgement and appreciation. Statements like "good and honest people", "they were very decent and hard-working", "calm and level-headed", or "we didn't see them as foreigners". I have never heard anyone say anything bad about Vietnamese people. I wish I could say the same about Muslims from the MENA countries, today. I just wanted to let you know that in the past, as well as today, you are very much appreciated in Germany.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left Vietnam with my mom when I was a baby. My dad died drowning in the sea trying to escape a year before us. 
 I've been in Vietnam for two weeks now and I was actually quite surprised by how much poverty there still is here. It seems that so many people are struggling and making so little money. The diet, stress, sunlight exposure seem to all contribute to the population having smaller bodies/frames and looking much older than their counter parts in the west. I'm 5'11" with a muscular build and I feel like freaking captain America walking around here. 
 All this makes me very grateful for my life. But I also feel guilty because I realize everything I have was given to me. I didn't choose to the west. I am just a product of my parents and environment. It was my mere chance that I am where I am and who I am. One little change in my past, like my mom deciding not to try to escape or getting caught escaping and I could be in saigon trying to hustle like everyone else here. 
 I am also saddened to see how much Vietnamese ppl struggle and work so hard in this ungodly humid and hot temperature. It seems like they have so few opportunities to advance and make a better life. 
 I have heard things are slowly changing though. More people are able to get higher education and the middle class is growing. I hope when I come back in ten years things will be much more different. 
 As viet kieus, do you guys feel the same gratitude and guilt as I do?

 As a viet kieu I have no problem going to a hole in the wall to order and eat. But when I go there I notice people there staring at me. And sometimes the workers have a bit of an attitude? I might just be paranoid or over thinking it. I speak Vietnamese (semi fluent) so I don't think they're annoyed that I can't order properly. 
 What do you guys think? Am I just being paranoid or is there really a locals only vibe at some places?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My family has been traveling for 3 years and have visited many different countries both developed and undeveloped. We're currently in Vietnam for the first time and although it's exciting here, I'm getting tired of a few things that we're not used to. Almost every day we have been here, the locals try scamming us. From the street sellers who give me less change money than I'm supposed to get, the "take a photo with my fruit basket on a stick" and then heckling you to give photo money or buy something, "take a free donut", etc. It's wearing me down as I'm a very honest person and have tried my entire adult life to support little mom and pop shops with their businesses. We just spent 2 months in korea and a week in Japan and those locals were very honest, did not heckle, and if they offered a free sample, it was really free. Plus the lack of consideration. Last night at 1:30am, there is construction still going on like a circular saw and banging metal. I wake up to it, and have to sleep with it. Does the police or other locals not care about quiet sleeping time? We have never encountered something like this on a constant basis in any other country we've traveled to.
 We are scheduled to leave here next week, then off to Ho Chi Mihn for a week, and then after that we had scheduled Da Nang for a whole month but now considering canceling Da Nang if it's going to be more of the same. So for people who have traveled to Da Nang, can you tell me if we will be facing the same situation as here in Old Quarter Hanoi?
 ​
 We have met some really nice people in nice shops who offer us good service and the right change so we have been returning to those spots to eat. There's a coconut/smoothie spot we enjoy so everyday we buy 5 drinks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! My family and I will be travelling to Vietnam in January 2024 for a month. I was wondering what the weather is like there? We will be spending a week in HCMC, a week in Hue and some days in maybe Da Nang, Nha Trang or Da Lat. I’m getting some mixed information that it’ll be hot, maybe chilly or foggy. 
 We are from Canada so I would really like to know what I should be mindful of and pack for. TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I just wanted to give an update on this poll I did a while back: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/16jlwu5/market_research_for_handbagtote_bag_fashion_start/
 ​
 I'm slowly launching the tote bags that I described in the original post. I feel a little bit embarrassed to try to push this new project out there but what do I have to lose then to share my experience right?
 I am so thankful for the people who voted in the poll and gave their opinions. It really helped me narrow down my focus. This is a passion project that stemmed from a long overdue trip to Vietnam.
 I was born in a refugee camp in Malaysia and moved to Canada when I was 4. I only been to Vietnam once when I was 14 on a family trip. Then this year back in April I decided to go back to Vietnam on my own at the age of 30. It was an incredible experience reconnecting with family and making new friends as a solo traveler who can barely speak Vietnamese. I have to say that Vietnamese locals are so open and love to connect with foreigners - I think that's what makes the country so great!
 Anyways, I got a felt tote bag from a popular Men's wear brand there and walked around with it in Canada, constantly getting compliments on the bag. I decided to start my own brand selling these felt tote bags with my own designs. Right now the designs and branding is focused on the soft "Asian" girl aesthetic but I hope to venture beyond these tote bags to explore different aspects of being Vietnamese living outside of Vietnam. I feel that we are constantly trying to connect to heritage while building a unique Western-Vietnamese experience navigating two cultures.
 I hope you guys follow The New Win on social media and check out the website: bythenewwin.com.
 As you can see the poll winner "Saigon District 1" inspired the first design. I'm gearing up for the first Drop soon and I hope you check back for more Drops in the future.

Did you lose weight?” and she waited for me to answer that question haha. Is this normal and should I expect more blunt comments like this? I’m not fat but I’m not skinny either. I’d say I’m midsize/curvy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[as the title says.
 today i had a call with my mom, and apparently in my hometown parents are really worried about their kids watching weird, loud videos where soldiers brutally killing humanoid heads in giant toilets. and i immediately knew it's the pointless "skibidi toilet" trend.
 this used to be a harmless thing where gamers made silly videos using a game called Garry's Mod just to have fun with each others.
 but Vietnamese trashy creators, as they always do, now catch up with the thing and try to create the most controversy and harmful things ever, while pasting "skibidi toilet" into the title to trick kids into giving them more views. horrible thumbnails with real Vietnamese faces popping out of a toilet, and you call that children's watchable contents?
 it's sad to see how abusive Vietnamese trash content creators have become. in the past, they literally made videos like Spiderman having weird thoughts with freaking Elsa from Frozen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my friends booked a flight to Thailand by searching through Skyscanner, booking was done through the third party Agoda platform. After a few days, we received an email that stated that our flight is changed from 12pm departure to 9pm departure from Singapore. We have activities already planned out and I feel it is unfair for them to change the timing without giving us the option to refund.
 We have tried calling them via the contact found on their website and Google maps (Call center 19001886 or send email to [19001886@vietjetair.com](mailto:19001886@vietjetair.com)) but nobody picked up, all their social media links to nowhere and we even tried visiting the office in Singapore, which is non existent ("Vietjet Air Singapore Ticketing Office" on Google Maps). 
 Has anyone encountered this situation before? Any advice on what we can do? (Ideally a refund)

 Feel free to tell me what you think. I'm wondering if the progression is not too quick - maybe I should add more levels with only two tones to choose from.
 Enjoy! :)

 https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3240554/vietnamese-decry-construction-borders-unesco-site-ha-long-bay-killing-everything
 A huge residential complex being built on the borders of Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay prompted a public outcry in the Southeast Asian country on Monday, as concerns mount over human impacts that have degraded the Unesco World Heritage site.
 The bay, famed for its brilliant turquoise waters dotted with towering rainforest-topped limestone islands, is one of Vietnam’s most popular tourist destinations, attracting more than seven million visitors last year.
 The shore and the surrounding town are already heavily developed. But on Sunday pictures were published in state media of an enormous construction site running through the waters – and next to the spectacular karsts – of Bai Tu Long Bay, which borders Ha Long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a serious question and is for discussion purposes.
 As I know, the official salary of officials is very low, even lower than workers. Even the prime minister's salary is only around 20,000,000 VND.
 This creates the first problem: because they are the only ones who can solve problems (administrative, legal) for the people. They will create barriers to make the problem more difficult to solve. To get bribe money.
 The higher their position, the more difficult problems they can solve, and the more bribes they can get. Because these positions can all be bought with money. This environment, of course, becomes a potential market for investment.

 Background: I'm Vietnamese- born and raised in vietnam but moved to United States at very young age. I'm still able to retain the language. My girlfriend is Egyptian born and raised in Egypt, and also moved to United States at a very young age. You rarely see Vietnamese/Egyptian couples in the states...which makes our relationship very unique. Both of our culture values are very similar. Most would think that Arab are muslim...which is true but my gf and I are both christian but different domination...anyways that's a whole different conversation of it own. My parents are very traditional. they would want me to date and marry to a Vietnamese girl. However to me, i should be able date anyone regardless of culture/race. Every time i would talk about girls outside of the culture they will give racist remarks.
 Question: How would i go about introducing my Girlfriend to my traditional Vietnamese parents without them having a prejudice mindset?

 During the discussion, Adani expressed his admiration for Pham Nhat Vuong's entrepreneurial journey. He was particularly impressed by how Vuong transitioned from the instant noodle business to becoming a leading force in the production of cutting-edge electric vehicles and advanced battery solutions for global sustainable mobility. All of this was achieved in a remarkably short span of time.

 I'm in Hanoi for three weeks and occasionally need to do some work. I just need a normal desk with an office chair and a monitor. I contacted some co-working spaces, which would be perfect because they charge by the day, but they don't offer any hardware (monitor, keyboard and a mouse).
 Another option would be to go to a gaming cafe and just plug their hardware into my laptop. Has anyone done that?
 Would renting the equipment be an option? Tried googling, but only a single really expensive option came up. Buying doesn't work as I will be traveling around Vietnam. 
 There should be quite a lot of digital nomads in Vietnam, so someone has to have dealt with the same problem. Didn't find any on this subreddit tho.
 Thanks!
 PS! I'll probably face the same problem in January at Da Nang, so any info on the way of the land over there would also be much appreciated.

But looking at how Bangladesh managed to get Russian help then I suppose it's the government's fault for having fallen into Western "renewable energy trap". We know that only nuclear energy can support economy better than renewables. So what are your opinions ?

 The Southeast Asian electronics manufacturing hub is home to Intel's largest factory worldwide for assembling, packaging and testing chips, and has been banking on the company further expanding there especially after Joe Biden announced deals to support Vietnam's chips industry during a visit in September.
 Vietnam is keen to position itself as an alternative to China and Taiwan, amid political risks and trade tensions with the United States.

I don’t know how to swim which I know is embarrassing and as it turns out one of the bucket list things to do is in ha long bay is kayaking. We’re doing the cruise which is fine but is kayaking something that’s recommended even for someone who can’t swim? Would I miss out on a lot if I don’t do it? My friends are okay with me just staying on the cruise and waiting but if it’s safe enough then I might give in. Any suggestions or opinions are welcome. Thank you!

 I think I’ve got a pretty solid itinerary planned, but since it’s the holiday season I’m hoping to pick up some unique souvenirs and gifts to bring back to the U.S. I found a shop in Ho Chi Minh City called OHQUAO that seems pretty great - unique paper goods/design. Wondering if there are other shops like this people would recommend I check out? I really enjoy shopping for home goods, art/decor, stuff like that.
 Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

We were walking along My Khe beach late afternoon in the rain, and suddenly noticed parts of the water got darker， with several cockroaches washed up on shore, some live ones were crawling around that area as well. I was shocked to see the sewage overflowing into the water. Is My Khe beach clean enough to swim? Or any suggestions for other beach areas north or south of my khe that may be more clean/safe?

 I’m a vietnamese American living in America and currently pregnant with our first baby. Recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have to meet glucose levels set by American medical institutes. Given that I’m ethnically Asian and grew up eating Asian food at home and maintain Việt culture at home life- I am apt to believe a lot of the American medical standards don’t fit me as I’m not the same genetic or dietary background as most of their standards which is collective studies base on the “average” white person (since white ppl make up the majority of the population in america) so was curious what vietnam did for gestational diabetes 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 My parents have extremely high triglycerides and don't show any signs of slowing down their white carbohydrate intake. It is in the 1,000+ range. I tried to find the word in Vietnamese but i haven't found it, and I only found words for blood pressure and cholesterol.
 How can I explain it to my parents? My viet is crap and I wasn't able to find so many articles on it. I would also like to show them some articles/videos in Vietnamese that will support what my doctor and I agreed on, which is a lower carbohydrate diet and its benefits, and why she should not be eating so many carbohydrates (80% of diet)

 In 1075-1077, the Vietnamese Ly Dynasty launched an invasion deep into Song China's territory. They were still a small kingdom that only gained independence 100 years ago and were attacking the strongest empire on earth at the time. The Song responded by invading Vietnam but they were defeated.
 The Mongols also invaded Vietnam and were defeated in all 3 times.
 While the Ming Dynasty conquered Vietnam in 1407, they were only able to hold Vietnam for 20 years.
 In 1471, Vietnam managed to wipe out Champa, which was an enemy for over 500 years out of existence. This is akin to France wiping Spain or Germany out of existence.

 Two friends visited me once in Hanoi and they were super excited about the chance to get laid with some asian girls. They were talking about it the whole time before they even arrived. Even though i opposed that, I showed them places where they could get what they want, for no more than 1.5M.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stayed at two hotels now and both were not good. They looked nothing like the pictures and even though they had good reviews, it seems like the reviews were lies. 
 The rooms were terribly small. One had no window whatsoever. The "pool" was like 2 feet deep. The "gym" was two treadmills and a bike. The construction quality of the rooms and bathrooms were shoddy. Everything felt thin and cheap. You can hear everything happening through the walls. 
 On the plus side, the staff were always extremely kind and helpful. I really loved the service. The breakfast nuggets were always good as well. 
 Both hotels were half a million dong per night. 
 Do I just need to find more expensive hotels? What's a good budget for something decent but not extravagant? A million dongs?

I will add that I am Vietnamese myself, and I call all my cousins whose parents are older than mine "chị/anh" (vice versa for younger and "em"), but is this the standard? Was curious since it does sometimes lead to me calling my cousins who are much older than me "Em" and my middle schooler cousins "Anh", and I always found it a bit funny

 I need some advice, please. I will stay in Hanoi for one and a half days, and I want to do a one-day trip. However, I'm a bit hesitant about which option to choose:
 1) Halong Bay (Route 2)
 2) Ninh Binh (Hoa Lu, Trang An, Tam Coc, Hang Mua)
 3) Bai Dinh, Trang An, Mua Cave
 Thank you so much

 Seems like this is especially true in Saigon. Is it the pollution? The constant hustle of city life? The cigarette smoking? The beer consumption? Poor quality of food? 
 In phu quoc, I notice ppl look a bit younger and overall happier.

I find it incredibly off-putting and it usually just makes me want to leave immediately as I feel under pressure.
 Has anybody else noticed this phenomena? Is it normal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From my many years of travelling, visiting all of Southeast Asia except Laos and Myanmar, East Asia and India, it's my first time an airport staff aggressively shouted at me. 
 After the Immigration, the guy who checks your passport and boarding pass in the final security check, alerted me that there's an issue with my check-in baggage. He told me to wait in the waiting area. I was very nervous since it's the first time that my baggage was questioned. And I kept thinking of worst case scenario like finding illegal items and being fined etc. I was waiting for a few minutes and asked politely (saying "Sir") and he said that the staff from the airline is arriving. There's no one at the security screening at that point and after several minutes, asked him politely again, and then he shouted in a loud aggressive voice "I TOLD YOU TO WAIT HUH. WAIT!! " and I was shocked by that aproach. Even his fellow staff looked at him. 
 I was shaken by his aggressive reply and just sat in my seat while he just turned his back at me. Fortunately, the airline staff arrived and accompanied me at the baggage screening. It was a pocket wifi and it's carry on only. After clearing, I went to other side of security and went to boarding gates.
 (Also earlier, the lady at the check-in counter seems very testy, the way she processed the check-in procedures) 
 The staff at Saigon Airport seems to be in a lot of stress and not very friendly. I really had a bad experience on this Airport and it made a pretty bad impression as a visitor, , unlike the ones in Hanoi and Da Nang.. Honestly, from the attitude of staff and the whole airport experience (queueing, check-in), it's much worse than the comparable NAIA (Manila) T3. Next time, I will choose Da Nang or Hanoi Airport.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi dear Vietnamese Redditors
 I’m reading about Vietnamese History and I’m wondering if Crown Prince Nguyễn Phúc Bảo Long had a son before he died in 2007. If not, does this mean the royal family in exile no longer has a successor anymore? 
 Thank you very much. 🙏🙏🙏
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Looking for some input and if I should remove or add any days anywhere in particular and if I'm missing something. I'm a medium paced traveller, don't take things too slow but neither rush through the trip. 
 I'm into cozy hotels (not too expensive), historical sites & museums, local food, drinks & coffee places. I'm not a nightlife person and usually stay away from crazy spots - doesn't mean that I don't like to visit and see them for a couple hours. I want to make the best out of my Vietnam trip. 
 I'm planning the following route in my Vietnam trip for so many days:
 Hanoi 4
 Ha Long Bay 2 (Here I plan a one night trip where they come pick you up from hotel and return you the next day - any agency you'd recommend? looking at prices online I expect around 350 euro pp)
 Ninh Binh 2 (Saw that can be done as a day trip but many people recommend spending the night)
 Sapa 3 (Here is the most uncertain part of the trip, not sure if worth spending the 6 hours of train/bus to reach here, stay 1 full day, and return the 3rd day - any experiences on how to proceed best?) 
 Hanoi 1 (coming back from Sapa and prepare for flight to Da Nang)
 Da Nang/Hue/Hoi An 5 (any idea how many days I should spend in each? I'm reading that Hoi An would be the best out of these 3 cities so I don't mind cutting 1 city to spend more time in Hoi An) 
 HCMC 3 
 Phu quoc/ Con Dao 4 (I still have to decide which of the islands I should go to - price wise flight from HCMC is similar but I'm reading plenty of negative stuff on Phu Q so I'm leaning more towards Con Dao).

 I am looking for some advice. I come from the UK and for Christmas I would like to get my partner a Vietnamese food themed hamper. He has absolutely fallen in love with the food and culture, so I wanted to get him something special for Christmas. So far in the hamper is a cookbook, personalised chopsticks, nuoc chan sauce. All these I can source quite easily in the UK. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Perhaps some traditional drinks or snacks? And if so, ideas of where I can buy them?
 Thank you so much!

I am open to more touristy options if they are really nice. I plan on doing a writing retreat and want as less distraction as possible, but would look forward for some nice mountain scenery or old village charm that i could easily stroll through on foot or bike.

 Too wet and best to try another time? Or not too wet and it’s worth staying a month starting early December? 
 I’m keen to surf, spend time by the beach, walk by the beach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First question is about how much I should be spending on good street food. I just bought a banh Mỹ with chicken and egg for 55,000 from a little corner shop. Good deal?
 Second question is about protein drinks. In Thailand there was a 7 Eleven every few steps, and they all sold various protein drinks. The Circle K I just went into had none. How can I procure protein drinks without buying a huge tub?
 Thanks everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend told me that in Vietnam there's a law where if you're in a car accident and at-fault, you have to pay the hospital bills of the person you injured. So apparently when someone gets hit, the driver will often turn around and try to "finish him/her off" since it's cheaper to pay for their funeral than all their medical expenses. 
 Is this true? Can someone link an article(s) where this actually took place. Sounds plausible yet comical.

 Một nguồn thông tin cho hay, Cơ quan CSĐT (Công an TP.HCM) vừa tống đạt các quyết định khởi tố vụ án, khởi tố bị can và thi hành lệnh bắt tạm giam đối với ông P.V.H. (47 tuổi, ngụ TP.Thủ Đức) về hành vi “Mua dâm người dưới 18 tuổi”.
 Các quyết định và lệnh trên đã được Viện KSND cùng cấp phê chuẩn.
 Ông P.V.H. đã bị tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân. Ông này từng mang cấp hàm Thượng tá, nguyên là phó khoa của trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân, trụ sở ở TP.HCM.
 Bước đầu, ông P. đã thừa nhận có hành vi mua bán dâm đối với bé gái 15 tuổi.
 Ngày 3/11, trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân đã có thông báo gửi đến công an các đơn vị, một số địa phương, học viện, trường, bệnh viện CAND về việc kỷ luật cán bộ. 
 Theo thông báo, vị phó khoa này bị kỷ luật bằng hình thức “tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân” từ ngày 1/11.
 Vụ án đang được Cơ quan CSĐT Công an TP.HCM mở rộng điều tra.

We don't want to be stuck on the streets with millions of people so either a big beach style party or something really elegant maybe, a resort with events would work also but I can't seem to find anything specific.

I'm a man. Otherwise healthy although I have had my blood pressure tested in the moderate to high zone at times, although other times it was normal. Not sure if I had nerves at the exam, but it has come out high in some exams. Not sure if I have any other issues. I can teach 12 hours straight if necessary, not sure why we need a confirmation of what can be seen, but what could get my visa not renewed? Thanks!

Just curious, how impactful is it ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I received a call informing me that the train I was traveling on SP3 had been cancelled, and my ticket would now be changed to SP1. I also received a text message, and I had no suspicion at the time.
 Just now, someone called me and asked me where I was. He said he would meet me at the Hanoi station and put me on the train. I thought to myself: The service of Vietnam Railway is really good.
 After I entered Hanoi Station, I found that the sp3 train had not been cancelled. There were many people in the train, and I could tell at a glance that they were also tourists. At the same time, I saw the person who called me. He was wearing a "xx travel" T-shirt but not the blue uniform of the Vietnam Railway . He put me on the train and told me he was sorry. I think I roughly understood it, and I didn't expose him. I didn't suffer any loss, and I knew that he was just an ordinary office worker who just wanted to complete his work.
 I guess maybe more people joined the tour group, but they didn’t have enough train tickets, so they randomly selected a few lucky passengers like us and lied to them. This should be something that tour groups operate and Vietnam Railways acquiesces to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve only ever been to Phu Quoc twice and both times I am convinced I flew later in the evening, around 9pm the first time and then 11pm the next. Getting the later flights allowed me to return home from work to collect luggage and then be on the island in good time. 
 However more recently I wanted to go back and found myself completely unable to find any flight that flies after 6.45pm. I checked multiple airlines, even seeing if booking a month or two made any difference. I couldn’t find anything. 
 Anyone got any idea what the hell is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently in hcmc and it’s my first week in Vietnam so excuse my lack of cultural wit.
 Today I was trying to park my bike and a random looking guy showed up. He started scribbling something on a piece of paper so I assumed he wanted to charge me for the parking. I told him to show me some kind of ID but he wouldn’t so I told him to get lost and just left the bike there. On my way back I realised he’s moved the bike to the middle of the road. I’ve got a few questions:
  
Do these people charge money for parking?
 
If so, on what basis? Like, do they own the parking spaces?
 
If they do charge, do I just trust any random looking dude here and hand them in my money?
 
What is his job exactly, how does anyone benefit from his services?
 
 Also I do apologise if I just broke some social standards. The only similar experience I’ve had was in Naples where local drug addicts demand money for parking, and I’ve been advised by my Italian friend to just ignore them. I would really like to know how to deal with this here in Vietnam.
