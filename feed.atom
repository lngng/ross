        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, I visited Vietnam and got this great face wash in the store when I forgot to bring my own. I didn't get to buy more before leaving, and now I want to buy a good amount and ship it to the U.S. However, all of the websites that I found selling the same face wash only ship within Vietnam. Does anyone know any way I can get it shipped to the U.S.? Alternatively, is there a similar face wash I can get in the U.S.? A lot of the U.S. brands are really bad for my skin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading an article about the oscar winning actor Ke huy quan, who was part of an ethnic chinese minority community in vietnam. He lived in a mainly chinese area of saigon and fled the country with his family after the south lost. The article mentions that “most” of the people who left south vietnam in the 70s were of chinese origin as well. This was surprising to me as i always thought it was mainly people of viet descent and maybe only a few chinese (I only know what i was told since im 2nd gen and was born way after my grandparents left). But do you think this was likely true about boat people being mostly chinese? If so why would mainly chinese people have been the ones to leave vietnam after the end of the war?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as the subject says… I’m an oxycodone addict - and could use some advice… 
 I am tremendously embarrassed that I’ve gotten myself into this position, but long story short - I recently sold a business to a large multi-national corporation who has an office in Ho Chi Minh. I’ll be traveling to the office next week - but am concerned about the risks associated with traveling through customs with oxycodone pills… without them I’d be going through intense withdrawals, so I have to either do the trip and bring pills with me, or find an excuse to cancel the trip outright - which would have some pretty damaging outcomes (and could literally reduce my remaining earn-out from the acquisition by millions of dollars usd).
 I’m not looking for comments on getting clean or other judgements at this phase - I have my own plans for how I’m going to achieve that once the financial aspect of the sale and related earn-outs are completed…. But I do want to better understand the risks id be taking if I travel to VN and going through customs with oxy pills.
 Can someone help clarify what the laws are? Especially for USA foreigners traveling for work?
 To be clear - I don’t have a script and when I travel in the USA I just put them in a pill bottle for an old unrelated medication. Considering doing the same here - but haven’t travelled to VN before and I’m seeing conflicting details on the web about our drug laws and related punishments.
 Thanks for your help and non judgement!

 Hàn Mặc Tử is also a man who really likes making poems in the new style (he will never be someone like Xuân Diệu who is just a man that adopted the French's poems and turned it into his own style). His early works before he got lyprosy were very similar to Xuân Diệu, the newest poets of the movement. After that though, his poems suddenly changes style to reflect on the suffering he had to endure, while maintaining his love for life around.
 It's weird, but the way he used words that are just plain visceral, and sometimes is borderline insane (his style was the crazy one during the movement). There's a certain level of sur…]]></summary>

 Some of you guys may know about Pro Wrestling - an art with combination of stage techniques and wrestling together to entertain people. Or you will familiarize with the name WWE, home of many famous athletes like John Cena, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Dave Bautista,..etc. At Saigon there was a group of many young and talented guys with the love for pro wrestling call Vietnam Pro Wrestling (VPW for short). They have trained and organized many shows to Vietnam fans. Starting from a small dance studio with 30-50 people, wrestling on mat to nowaday performing on real wrestling ring, with attendance around 200-300 people per show.
 This June 3rd, they will organized their biggest event in the year called Ultimate Collision. Beside our Vietnamese wrestlers, we will have attendance from other wrestlers in Southeast Asia. So if you guy want to experience a burning hot and energetic Saturday night, maybe take your free time to attend their incoming show. More details on Vietnam Pro Wrestling facebook page.

 https://wisevoter.com/country-rankings/divorce-rates-by-country/
 https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/divorce-rates-by-country
 Vietnam has a marriage divorce rate at around 0.2 per 1000 people or around 5-10% of all vietnamese people will get divorced. Compared to the US were almost 50% of married people will get a divorce. That is about a 10x of the rate in US. Anyone has some light to shed on the reason why this is the case? Comment from article. 
  
Lowest Divorce Rate in the World Vietnam possesses the lowest divorce rate in the world, at 0.2 per 1,000 people. This is an impressive feat for a country with a population of over 97 million, as it indicates that couples in the region are more likely to stay together than those living elsewhere in the world. In addition to this, Vietnam has one of the highest marriage rates overall. The culture puts considerable emphasis on family and loyalty within relationships, which helps explain why divorce rates are so low. Furthermore, marriage is seen as a means of protection from poverty or any other form of financial instability as couples share costs and resources. Finally, societal norms and expectations play a major role; especially amongst older generations who frown upon divorce and may even threaten older married couples with social exclusion if they decide to end their marriages. All these factors combine to result in very low divorce rates in Vietnam compared to other countries around the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started watching some Vietnamese movies in order to practice Vietnamese and started to wonder about the type of content that can be seen in Vietnam.
 Does Vietnam allow certain amounts of gore, blood, or violence to be shown in TV shows or movies or is it really limited in what can be seen? Is nudity allowed in media or is it partially censored like in countries like Japan? Is porn illegal in the country or is it allowed?
 Sorry for the questions but I was just curious to know what directors and writers are dealing with when creating shows or films in the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have browsed on many Vietnamese forums, subreddits and even Youtube videos. Once or twice, I would see a Vietnamese netizen drop this word Tây Lông.
 Apparently this is a word used to ridicule Westerners in general, as it translates literally to “hairy Westerners”. I have seen very negative attitudes towards Westerners in communities such as r/trotruyenlinhtinh, where they seem to have a negative bias against Westerners.
 Personally I would never stoop down that low and use that word, regardless of the social situations, like even if a Western tourist was rude. But how is the word perceived by Vietnamese people? Should this word be considered rude and offensive?
 EDIT: Apologise, the subreddit name is r/trochuyenlinhtinh, instead of r/trotruyenlinhtinh, rookie mistake on my Vietnamese spelling part lol

But it was portguese missionaries who where the first Europeans that came to vietnam and latinize the classically written classical script of Vietnamese.
 So my question is, does anyone know more history about how the portuguese language influenced Vietnamese? I was learning brazilian portuguese independently and noticed some similarities with Vietnamese. For example the use of the ~ tilde accent mark, and the "nh" constant cluster sounding like "y". I was able to find this article and a few comments on the Vietnamese alphabet Wikipedia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 Recently I am considering studying Data Analytics for a possible Data Analyst/Business Analyst job (heard they're often strongly related), so I wanted to ask some questions about the market here in Vietnam or East Asia with a specific focus on foreigners, since I am one.
 Hope there is someone in this group currently doing these types of job here in Vietnam or in East Asia that can provide some insights.
 I have a Bachelor degree in Chinese studies, so not related, just recently completed an internship in my country's chamber of commerce here in Vietnam.
 I would start from scratch and self-study online (I know it's not easy but I did it before and got some certifications on Coursera, Udemy etc...).
 Questions:
 1) Is there a fundamental language barrier when it comes to the data in relationship to the country you are working in? More specifically, will the data be in the local language? / Do you need to have proficiency in the local language in order to find a job in the field?
 2) Is it sensible for a foreigner to search for those types of job or will a local professional always be preferred?
 3) Briefly, how would you describe your experience in this field here in Vietnam or East Asia as a foreigner? Positives, negatives, up, downs?
 4) Finally, do you have any tips or recommendations?
 Thought this may be useful for any foreigner wondering about their career in Asia.

 To give a bit of background, I've lived in the UK for almost half of my life. I left Vietnam during my high school years and have been working/studying here ever since. I have a good job, earning well above average wage and I'm happy with all aspects of my life here. 
 I go back to Vietnam once in a while and was surprised by how much things have changed. There definitely are a lot of opportunities there, especially when it comes to having your own start up firm, and potentially earn way more than if I continue as a salary worker in the UK after taking into account of the cost of living. That and the fact that my parents are getting old and I want to spend time with them, made me want to go back. 
 However, within the last 2 months, as I've been saying goodbye to everything and everyone I know here, I just feel a sense of sadness that I'm leaving my comfortable life and good career behind for something that might not work out. I feel like I might be making a big mistake. To make it worse, I'm almost certain now that my relationships with my parents are beyond repair, and we won't get along no matter what. 
 My flight is just a few weeks away and I feel very much like just not going to the airport, and just telling my boss that I'm not leaving anymore and going back to the way it was before.
 I'm just posting it on here in the slim chance that someone might have been in the same boat and have some advice to offer.

I wonder if it's okay when I go to Vietnamese places like Little Saigon and speak with my "Hanoi" accent normally there. I never been to the States before, tho, and I heard a few guys got threatened or discriminated by speaking those accent. Idk if they were just joking or sum tho.
 Moreover, how should I behave there? should I just be normal like in Vietnam or is there something I need to worry about? I'm sorry if my question triggered some of you guys. I know the history and have no hate towards 'boat people' at all. It's just i never been to The States so I really need this kind of information.
 Btw, thanks for helping me my fellow redditors, hope y'all have productive day 😁

 One day, as he was preparing his banh bao for the day, he was visited by a strange, otherworldly presence. The entity introduced itself as Ong Tao, the kitchen god, and explained that it had been watching Thực's selfless work and recognized his desire to help others through the power of food.
 In recognition of Thực's compassion and dedication, Ong Tao bestowed upon him a great gift: the ability to be in multiple places at once, and a cart with a bottomless supply of banh bao. With this power, Thực could feed anyon…]]></summary>

Từ sau lần cuối xảy ra sự kiện đó, chúng ta đã quá quen thuộc với cái nóng và đã dần thích nghi với nó. Đã gần 300 năm kể từ khi những con quái vật từ trong mặt trời xuất hiện. Chúng ta đã chiến đấu và kết quả nhận được là sự diệt vong trên diện rộng do bão mặt trời từ những con quái vật gây ra. Trong một khu bảo an cuối cùng của nhân loại. Cương vội rít nhẹ điếu thuốc lá có thể xem là còn sót lại cuối cùng trên vũ trụ này. Vốn dĩ anh không hề thích thuốc lá, nhưng từ sau khi chứng kiến Dương, người bạn thân giàu sinh ra tử cùng mình lại biến mất một cách bí ẩn thì anh ta cũng đã thay đổi thói quen và tính cách. Ngày hôm nay cũng như mọi ngày Cương vẫn vậy. Tay cầm khẩu súng và leo lên trạm quan sát. Từ góc nhìn này anh có thể nhìn thấy toàn cảnh khu bảo an. Những đứa nhóc chạy chơi xung quanh những bãi cỏ bị cháy và những người lớn đang canh tác trên những cánh đồng khô héo, xa hơn có thể thấy những thành phố mà anh chỉ được nghe kể về thời kỳ mà con người vẫn còn làm chủ hành tinh này từ những người lớn tuổi. Bất giác anh như vô thức lau đi những giọt mồ hôi chen lẫn nước mắt khi nghĩ về nó. Rồi anh lại hướng mắt xa hơn về phía đó. Bất chợt anh thấy từ xa có vẻ có người đang đi về phía trại bảo an. Ngay lập tức anh ra hiệu cảnh báo để toàn trại vào trạng thái chiến đấu. Các hệ thống cảnh báo vang lên gầm rú như tiếng súng nổ. Các ụ súng và hệ thống tên lửa được kích hoạt, các chiến binh đều đã vào hệ thống công sự để phòng thủ. Bất ngờ Cương vội ra hiệu tắt hệ thống cảnh báo và phòng thủ vì hình như anh nhận ra điều gì đó... Hết tập 1... Mình mới tập viết truyện để giải sầu vì cuộc sống thực nó quá tiêu cực với mình. Ae xem nếu không thích thì cmt để mình gỡ nha, cảm ơn các bạn ! Vô Danh !!!

 I’m a 21m student and I took a job as a waiter at a Vietnamese restaurant. I was born in Germany, but both my parents are Vietnamese and my Vietnamese is enough to hold a conversation and, after having worked one year at the restaurant, I communicate with my colleagues in Vietnamese during work without any problems. 
 I shortly shelved products at a supermarket before working as a waiter, so I don’t have much experience, but wanted to earn some money on the side. 
 I’m quite committed to my job, maybe a little foolishly so. If I get called short-notice, I come to work. I can get a bad conscience when thinking about customers not getting decent service or my colleagues getting under too much pressure. I have dr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you guys heard any stories from your parents about period 1975 - 1986 in Vietnam?
 The period of the “Subsidy Economy” (Bao cap) (1975-1986) has been known as a time of hardships, when mechanism for socio-economic management was inappropriate, causing privations in people’s material and spiritual life. Material life was poor due to a sluggish and inefficient production system, but the constraints also applied to people’s creative and spiritual endeavors.
 “Bao cap” was a period during which both the courage and intelligence of millions of people were suppressed and were anxious about liberation. It was a dramatic period, and a profound lesson about the law of social development.
 During this period, food, goods, and services were purchased with coupons or food stamps. Those with a position in government received more coupons and had access to special shops. For those without special status, they could expect to spend almost a day waiting in line to buy rice and other basic commodities. Everything was controlled by the government. Having a bicycle – even one that was ancient and on the verge of breakdown – was considered a luxury. If you were fortunate enough to own one, you'd be on a special list of bicycle owners allowed to buy parts (such as inner tubes, nuts, bolts, etc.).
 My parents met each other in an illiteracy eradication class. They also told me that when they finished secondary, people ran through backgrounds check (which side you supported during the war) and eventually my parents couldn’t go to high school. Can you guys share your family’s stories regarding this period?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, me and my partner are planning two weeks in Vietnam in either September or early October. We're coming from the UK and want to make the best use of our time. My current thinking is to stay in the North to avoid the bad weather in the centeral region. Would like to visit Hanoi, Ha Long, Sapa and maybe Ninh Binh or one other place. 
 Few questions: - I would love to visit Hue and Hoi An but are we right to avoid these in October? - Most two week sample itineraries cover the whole country , but is there enough to do in the North for two weeks? - Are there any other cities worth visiting in the North? - Would it be worth adding a destination outside of North Vietnam somewhere where the weather is ok e.g. South Vietnam, Cambodia etc?
 Thanks! ☺️

The Nha Nghi I was in on 30/4 was next to a Karaoke place which closed at 3am so no sleep till then (good for them it sounded like a great party.) I decided to find a Nha Nghi outside of town so it would be quiet and rural but a guy turns up outside at 5am and starts having a conversational chat with himself on a megaphone. Is this normal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting ready to go to Vietnam in about 2 months and had a pre-travel consultation at my health clinic (in the US). The doctor highly recommended the Japanese encephalitis vaccine but said it's 2 shots at $350 each in the US but it would be much cheaper if I just get it when I arrive. I'm flying into Hanoi first, but can't seem to find any clinics in Hanoi that offer it. It looks like it's pretty easy to get it in Bangkok....but before I switch up my plans and buy a ticket from Hanoi to Bangkok just for a shot, I figured it'd be wise to check on here and see if anyone can recommend a clinic in Hanoi that offers this vaccine. Thanks so much!

There exists similar rules for Filipinos working abroad when leaving the Philippines, a kind of archaic form of government control/corruption.

Children in a past often said “hitler!” as a slang which means to end a friendship, this term mostly used as a joke despite many didn’t even know who Hitler was before. So do y’all know where did this come from, out of nowhere? Like a fact that people in countryside Vietnam usually names their dog after US presidents or officials involved in Vietnam War.

He speaks German well, so there is no language barrier between us. We hang out and really hit it off. We are at the same age, so we have many things in common. I showed signs of interest many times but he hasn’t asked me to be his girlfriend. I think I am quite pretty blonde, so he may find me attractive. Are Vietnamese guys shy to show their interest? Or they only want serious relationship with Vietnamese girls. Should I ask him if he wants to be my boyfriend?

 Trong những năm gần đây, rất nhiều thành phố lớn cạn kiệt cả nguồn nước, như São Paulo ở Brazil; Chennai ở Ấn Độ và Cape Town ở Nam Phi. Năm 2018 vừa rồi đánh dấu một thứ gọi là Day Zero (nghĩa là ngày mà ngay cả những con đập cũng không còn một giọt nước). Ở Việt Nam chúng mình, bà con nông dân ở khu vực đồng bằng sông Cửu Long vừa phải chống chọi với hạn hán, vừa phải chịu đựng nước mặn xâm lấn vào sâu trong đất liền do biến đổi khí hậu gây nên.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Am travelling Vietnam this month- I'm a young South Asian woman (born and bred in Australia though) and I always feel like I get looked at but maybe I'm just overly self conscious about it so notice it more... But wondering if there are prejudices held. Sometimes I get compliments on my skin tone (I'm lighter skinned but even then I'm paranoid they're secretly taking the piss out of my skin tone)... I feel anxious that the looks I get come from a place of racism/judgement, and sometimes feel like there's a change in attitude when they hear me speak fluent English. Anyway- honesty is appreciated!

I may be a bit more concerned since I came here with my 2 yo. Has there every been like a car seat for scooters? In case anyone thinks going slower while mother holds on is any kind of protection like my wife told me. 8kg crashing at 25km/h exerts a mass force of almost 500kg. Don’t know many babies that would survive that kind of impact or know any moms who could hold onto 500kg. I understand there’s often no other way to travel in Vietnam but at least like a pod or something for the baby to TRY to escape a crash without death or permanent disfigurement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the west we obviously have a reputation for drinking too much hard liquor and far too frequently. 
 But I enjoy a beer about as often as Vietnamese do. 
 That is, on special occasions or social gatherings. 
 My problem is how much beer. I like 1-2 decent quality beers and some good relaxed conversation.
 But I find over here my cup just keeps getting refilled. 4,5,6,7 beers later and the case is empty. It's just too much for my stomach or bladder to handle to be honest. I didn't even drink like that when I was a delinquent teenager. 
 People start getting obnoxious and getting me to say rude and inappropriate things in Vietnamese (which I don't speak very well). And they try to make me say it over and over and over again because they're totally wasted. 
 I miss that culture of the west where you can take part in the drinking circle and everyone just drinks as much as they feel like. No pressure to gulp down 5L each. 
 I honestly like the taste of Tiger. It's a pretty good beer for a mass-produced brew. 
 But I've had to completely give up social drinking while I'm here. My body just can't handle that much anymore. I'm only 27 but I take antidepressants. 
 I don't like to drink alone and my wife doesn't like beer. 
 So that's my story. This Canadian is done drinking beer. I like the taste, hate the drunk. 
 Not meant to be derogatory at all. This is just me expressing myself. I understand every culture is different and I've taken part in the drinking circle once with every new group I meet just to build that trust with them. But from then on I just refuse. It never just stops at 1-2 beers. 
 Also, ice in warm beer? Cold out of the fridge man. Cold out of the fridge. Completely ruins the taste for me.

 If you can already speak Vietnamese to some extent, what kind of content/materials do you think would really help you become fluent?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I speak English originally but I would like to learn this language and visit Vietnam one day. Duolingo and the books I got are helping me understand grammar and how to read the language bit by bit, but I SUCK at speaking it, and I know I do. And I don't know any native speakers personally anymore to help correct my pronunciation. I think I end up overthinking and trying to implement the tones but in doing this I just mess the whole word up lol.
 I've tried saying phrases and words really slow then gradually increasing speed til at a normal speaking cadence and this helps a bit but I was wondering if there was something more efficient. Also I feel like due to my natural voice being kind of deep/bassy and the sort of hard way I tend to pronounce things the naturally softer or more nuanced sounds are kind of harsher than the audio samples I'm hearing. I'm just really having a hard time with this because my voice is deep and somewhat monotone unless I'm excited about something so it's hard to do the tones and when I do I feel like I'm over emphasizing them.
 It's bad enough I tend to even stutter a bit more than usual in English too but I completely butcher this beautiful language almost every time it comes out of my mouth. And I wanna be able to speak to native speakers but not laughably 💀 I know most people are gracious and kind enough to just appreciate you even took the time but still why do it if not correctly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am planning to visit Vietnam soon for my vacation. I am also interested in exploring the possibility of adding 360-degree videos of public street locations to Google Street View that are currently not available on Google Maps. 
 As of now, I have noticed that only major roads have been filmed and added to Google Street View. However, I am curious about the feasibility of capturing more street locations and making them accessible on Google Maps. I understand that it is important to respect privacy and comply with any laws or regulations regarding photography in public spaces. 
 Therefore, I am seeking information on the legal implications of such a project in Vietnam. Specifically, I am interested in knowing if there are any restrictions on filming in public spaces and if capturing 360-degree videos of public street locations is allowed. I would also like to ensure that the project complies with local laws and respects the privacy of individuals. 
 Thank you for any guidance or information you can provide on this matter!

I am dealing with some injurys but have had great success with Active Release Technique (or ART). I was wondering if anyone can reccomend a massage type/parlor that does something similar to this. I know that I probably won't be able to find an ART practicioner while in Hanoi so was wondering what the next best thing may be. For context ART basically involves hitting certain pressure points in soft tissue and manipulating the muscles around them through releases (i know just sounds a regular massage but it's been much more effective than say Thai massages I've had in the past). If anyone has any ideas I'd really appreciate it, thanks!

 Basically where should I definitely avoid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australian here, I visit Vietnam every few years as I have family living in Saigon. Everytime I visit Vietnam, I always experience really bad food poisoning. My last visit to Vietnam was about 5 years ago, and that time was probably the worst food poisoning I've ever experienced, absolute bed ridden for about a week. 
 Any tips on how to avoid food poisoning and what to watch out for? I will be travelling to Vietnam again in a few months time and I'm definitely going to avoid eating raw food, as I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from eating raw fish at a japanese restaurant in Phan Thiet. Many thanks!

 My girlfriend and I are traveling through Vietnam since a week now, and we are enjoying it so much. You have a beautiful country and I’ve seldomly experienced such a degree of hospitality! 
 We arrived late this night in Hanoi and are now looking for activities to fill the upcoming days. If I’ve understood correctly, today is reunification day and tomorrow is workers day? Would there be any parades or festivities in the city, one could attend? 
 Thank you so much in advance and feel free to share anything, you think we could enjoy here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a job offer in Thu Dau Mot. There is not a ton of information about this town online, at least in English. I am a little worried about there not being much to do or being able to meet other English speakers and making friends. I am curious if anyone here has any insight. What is life like in Thu Dau Mot? Is there much to do for a foreigner? The only other post asking about TDM is a few years old and I was told the area has seen a lot of growth. Has anything changed?
 About me: I am a male, in my 30's, from the USA, and single. I speak no Vietnamese, although I enjoy learning languages and will attempt to learn basics while living in Vietnam. I don't drink or care too much about having access to crazy nightlife, although I like the option of being able to go out occasionally with people. I enjoy nature, riding my motorcycle around, and doing outdoorsy stuff.
 Thanks!

 Not heading back across until November, so I’m trying to get a feel for the market.

These criminals from lower caste raise chickens and rooster for illegal cock fights and the roosters always crow at 2Am disrupting everyone else’s sleep .It’s sad that the local police favors these criminals since the dirty money get from orchestrating the cock fight pay the police well. Corrupted city that act a safe haven for criminals. What a sad country full of decadency

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I’m an American who’s engaged to a Vietnamese woman and we are living in the US. I noticed pretty early on when she eats she tends to make quite a bit of noise and chews with her mouth open. This is something that kind of drives me insane but I’ve gotten used to it. When I met her parents I noticed her Dad made some interesting noises as well. I did gently tell her once for her own awareness that many Americans consider these things rude or slightly gross, but mostly because I didn’t want her to feel embarrassed if she didn’t know. With things like noodles or soup I can understand to a degree but sometimes it’s almost distracting. Is this just a cultural difference and do Vietnamese people have no problem with it?
 Edit: thank you to all those who provided their thoughts and aren’t so sensitive they somehow took this personally lmao, I appreciate it!

I have been doing some research over the week and I'm finding myself a little overwhelmed by the options. Anyone try these out? Things you liked or didn't like? Was there anything you wished was available or anything that was you didn't need or want? It seems like the activities are based on the boat you choose. This is our first time visiting the country and I'm thrilled for the new experience. Any input would be appreciated!

They just bought it a few months ago, and in that time they've sent me home with lots of different homemade dishes; bánh mì, bún thịt nướng chả giò, bún bò Huế, and bánh xèo for starters - all incredibly delicious. They don't want me to pay for it, saying they're just happy someone loves their food. I've increased my tip, but I wasn't sure if etiquette called for something more.

 I am an Irishman in Hue for the four months, and looking for a way to practice bass as I play in a band at home. So far I haven't been able to find either an electric or an acoustic bass in Hue music shops, and I'm wondering if one of you lovely folks could point me in the right direction?
 Am I more likely to find a bass in a pawn shop? Or, if any of you are from Hue, do you have any musician friends who might have seen one for sale?
 Thanks very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full context, I’m a tourist. 
 I’m just wondering what you think it would take to change mindsets about littering?
 Today I was sitting by a small river in Hoi An and there was a tea vendor who came over and tossed two beer cans and a styrofoam package into the water. Not even 7m from him other locals fishing. 
 And I just can’t help but wonder, does he not know that pollution kills potential income and food for his neighbors? Is it education that’s needed?
 Or is it something else?
 And I’m not judging here, I’m honestly curious about why littering is so common in some SE Asian countries. (I had a similar experience while trying to scoop up trash that kids were throwing into a river in Thailand. Which they thought was hilarious for me to do.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m studying in the US and is set to return to Vietnam this June. I wanted to see how dating is like in Vietnam, specifically Hanoi, before officially returning so I got on Bumble and let’s just say I am scarred for life.
 Every guys I have talked to kind of expressed that I was not good-looking to them. I am 5’2 (163 cm), which is said to be average height but most guys told me I would have a difficult time finding a partner in Vietnam bc that’s too tall. One guy said I looked like a random Tiktok man and another said I looked prudish when his goute was “modern women.” I asked what do modern women look like and he said “someone who is stylish and knows how to take care of herself.” He further said since I went to a Western university, I should have adopted their way of dressing up: more revealing clothes and heavy makeup. I told him that here in the US, it is not that common to see students dressing up and have a full-faced makeup every day. Then he kept asking for bikini and croptop pics. Though I don’t wear bikini, I like crop tops so I can send him some, but I declined bc I think it’s rude to ask for these photos because he wants “to have some motivation to tán me”.
 At first, I just want to find someone I can talk to but these interactions really crushed my confidence and made me hyper-aware of my looks. I wouldn’t say I’m ugly and I have never heard that from anyone else. In fact, a lot of people (both Vietnamese and American) called me cute or pretty. My clothes are not out of style at all. I just don’t like too revealing clothes and don’t like wasting time on heavy makeup. I guess the best word you can describe my style is classic Parisian (and occasionally basic hoodies + jeans). I am starting to doubt whether moving back home is a good idea as it feels like I would not fit in at all. 
 Maybe, I guess I just forgot how much Vietnamese cared about vanity.

News of Animal Cruelty seems to be consistently coming out of Vietnam from dead whales washing up on shore in their droves without being investigated (https://globalvoices.org/2016/06/07/tons-of-fish-are-dying-mysteriously-in-vietnam-whales-too/amp/) to tiger/bear bile farms that operate despite prohibition (https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/news/hanoi-last-race-end-bear-bile-farming-vietnam-urgent-action-needed). This topic is interesting enough to me that I’ve been conceptualising a potential documentary on the subject and was wondering why people think it even got to this point? Globalisation? Influence from China? Simple lack of legislation or awareness? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with the topic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry in advance, if this is the wrong subreddit to post this here, as I could not find any Vietnam History specific sub-reddit.
 Hi everyone!! I am Pranjal(Male from India). I am highly interested in urban history-seeing how urban spaces originate and grow. Hanoi was of particular interest to me as it possibly is the continuously inhabited oldest city in SEA(from time of Dongson Culture- Co Loa). 
 I have spent the past month charting out the history in Hanoi from Co Loa, Northern Domination, Thang Long, French Colonization, Socialist era and post Doi Moi era(till around 2018) going into as much detail as possible. I just landed in Hanoi yesterday and plan to be here for a week. As part of my (amateurish) research, wanted a perspective from a Hanoi local as well who has an interest/knowledge regarding Hanoi's history(especially regarding the architectural history). In return for the help, more than happy to share my knowledge regarding history, bear any transportation/food costs, even cook some Indian food for you :) etc 
 Also if in case you have reference of some paid historical service/tour group which can give me an holistic overview of Hanoi from Co Loa to present( I couldn't find any), that will be great as well. 
 Thanks in advance for the help :) 
 The sources that I have used so far-
 1. Hanoi: Biography of a City - William Stewart Logan
 2. Vietnamese Architecture - Le Phuoc
 3. Van Horen, B. (2005). City profile Hanoi. Cities, 22(2), 161–173.
 4. The new Hanoi: Opportunities and challenges for future urban development- Divya Leducqa, Helga-Jane Scarwellb
 5. The origins of Ancient Vietnam- Nam C. Kim

 https://i.imgur.com/00jQDgE.jpg
 Most often, these are written like a fraction, so: 850 kg / 5N. 
 As an engineer, I got used to units and my 1st thought was: kilogram (kg) per Newton (N) does not make any sense. They are both related via F = ma, so why divide them? And it's not like the division will yield "a" which is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. 
 Anyway, I found out today after speaking with a trucker: N means Người aka passenger 🤣 So it lists the max no. of passenger you are allowed in the truck.

 I know they were in my case internal flights, but Da Nang and Hanoi airports were an utter breeze in comparison.
 Why is everything so slow and inefficient at this airport? Is it always this terrible?

We are taking over with us 30 million VND in cash and have recently seen we need to declare this as it's over 15 million (conflicting information on Gov.uk website). How do we do this? Is it done when we arrive in Vietnam? On the plane? Before we go?? 
 Our airline (bamboo airways) unfortunately hasn't been any help and their correspondence tells us to ask the UK Government. 
 Thankyou for any help!

 I am a Swede with half Vietnamese blood. I have lived in Sweden since I was a child and sometimes return to Vietnam after getting married. About 2 years ago, also in April, I was stuck in Vietnam due to the outbreak of COVID. I was surprised to see that the media in Vietnam often publishes positive news about the local epidemic situation but spread the opposite news about other countries, especially the West and the US. I remember they said that American people have no food and students have to eat leftovers. When I asked my wife (100% Vietnamese and her family lives there), she said it's normal with TV stations there. Then, when the nightmares of the epidemic passed and we returned to Sweden, we kept receiving calls from her family in Vietnam, asking if we were okay and hungry because television often broadcast news about the bad situation. like Europe is about to enter the stone age —a food crisis, a gas crisis, that sort of thing. And most recently, when we planned to join a tour, which included a visit to the West Coast of the US, there were calls from her family again, like, be careful of the shootings!
 But yesterday, when my wife showed me this statistic, I just... I wondered what was going on. After the wars, why do Vietnamese people have such warm affection for America?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still quite new to Saigon since my family moved here for work. I miss dating girls and I didn't give it a try so far because I am still quite unfamiliar with customs here.
 I'm not really looking for a relationship right now more just having a good time with open minded people. You could say I'm looking to "picking up girls" and I'd love to hear some advice how people roll with this kinda thing here. Where would be the best locations and what is and isn't generally accepted here when flirting or trying to get closer to someone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello people,
 I am going travelling around SE Asia for a couple of months but I am worried about travelling with my ADHD medication. I am unsure of the legality of Elvanse in Vietnam as it is an amphetamine based stimulant, so I was considering switching medication to Concerta (methylphenidate) and bringing in a 2 months supply with a doctors note.
 This is not ideal but it will keep me going. 
 I have tried calling the Vietnamese embassy but I am sent straight to an answer machine with no option to speak to a human and I have tried to book an appointment but they are jam packed until July 😬 
 If anyone could shed any light on the legality of both Elvanse and Concerta in Vietnam I would be incredibly grateful. First hand experience is great too but it would be amazing if someone had some solid legal advice with a link or something. Just to put my mind at ease 😎 
 Also, I’m sorry if this question isn’t permitted on this sub - just remove it.
 Thank you 😊

 I am curious to know what is your impression/thoughts of Vietnamese food when you see it through pictures, videos, etc. Do you like it, find it appealing or not?
 Therefore, I am conducting research for my graduation thesis with the topic "The effect of Vietnamese food's visual experiences on tourists' emotions and travel motivation". And I am collecting data through this survey https://forms.gle/D1ZrPZhjjDCTU2uZA so I really appreciate if you can spend only about 5 minutes to share your thoughts on the survey because I really need 30 responses more.
 Thank you so much in advance.
 I would really love to discuss Vietnamese food with you.

I did as she told me and the plant did well the first couple of days but now it's starting to wilt and the leaves changed colors, got paler. She also has no idea what I did wrong. I didn't find any help on any other forum so I wanted to ask here, maybe someone has more experience with this plant.

 Yen Hao is supposed to be the first and middle name, Dong the surname. I know that with Vietnamese names, the surname usually comes first. But my play takes place in Czech Republic, and from what I've seen, Vietnamese people around here usually use the Czech order of names (so given name(s) first, surname second).
 If the name is incorrect, I'd be very glad to hear alternatives! He's based on the character of Yevgeni Dorn from Chekov's Seagull, so I'm looking for a name that sounds vaguely similar, although it's in a different language. Thanks for any help:)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friends of mine recently came back from their business trip in Australia. They said that normally most of the shops close at 6-7pm and on weekend most of them are closed. I was kind of surprise hearing this, I also asked my friend living in Canada and he confirmed the similar thing. They all agreed that it was boring to live there. But for me, I feel sad for Vietnamese people who has to get up early to work or stay late to work too. I said to my friends, we are poorer so we spent all time in a day to work. They close shop at night and on weekend so they have quality time for them and they are not really obsessed of making money. What are your opinions on this, from outside and inside VN people?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I have been in Vietnam for a week. Since getting here, my phone has gone from working essentially the same as back home (The US) to dying more quickly than charging when plugged in (it only actually charges with the phone turned off), and dying very quickly when not off the charger. When put into airplane mode and with no wifi connected it seems to deplete more slowly. 
 These are my guesses as to what is going on:
 a) the combination of charger box and charger cord I have are weak, I should try and find a stronger cord
 b) I am using Verizon's international plan and don't have a SIM card yet, so having my cell service and mobile data turned on is killing my phone. 
 I will go out and buy a stronger charger today and likely be getting my SIM installed either today or tomorrow. 
 Are there any other problems that could be happening based on anyone's experience that I could be missing? It's starting to make things quite challenging so I'd love any ideas as to how to help!

Trúng gió - for example perplexed me for years.. usually they relate this to family members getting sick from being outside or exposed to wind. From my understanding, it is the western equivalent to catching a cold. Maybe for older folk who have health conditions should be worried, but people are outside in wind all the time, yet it's spoken about like a death knell waiting to happen to you. NEVERMIND the fact that taking walks outside in the sun, getting breath of fresh air is literally the best thing for you. I've heard an additional explanation from a Vietnamese is that a sudden gust of wind could cause a stroke, temperature imbalance, or just shock in some way. Possible? Sure. B…]]></summary>

 In all that time I've also been approached only once by someone who was asking for money (we'd call it begging where I'm from.). 
 What's the deal? Is it tight familial structures that keep people from being homeless or is it the state taking care of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I was extreme curious about Vietnam, so that I decided to spend my full 2 weeks of vacation to travel down from Hanoi to da nang. Initially I planned to come here around eastern, so the beginning of April, but due to projects at works I needed to postpone my stay by 3 weeks.
 Now I arrived in Hanoi and it’s extremely cloudy / gray and the locals told me that this is the weather I need to expect for the next 2 weeks.
 I was wondering if I should fly down to hoe chi minh and then travel up to da nang.. cause that’s where my flight starts to Cambodia (my next stop)

Are the major corporations owned by the government like china? Are most personal assets owned by the government like the USSR? What in policy actually makes it communist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in Vietnam for two weeks now and it's an amazing and beautiful country and culture. The only thing I've been disappointed with has been the weather. I love sunny days no matter the temperature and I've looked at the forecast multiple times to see "sunny". But not once has there been any blue sky. Is this smog or something else?
 Also I'm in Sapa at the moment and cannot see the mountainous backdrop due to this haze which is very disappointing.

Everything seems far from the Vietnamese culture. I am also shocked by so much money spent when Phu Quoc clearly suffers from a lack of hygiene and waste management. But I may be influenced by my European culture, so I would like to have your opinion on the matter.

But I have no idea what it means or where it comes from? From what I translated its land owned by Uncle 7?
 I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this for me. Does anyone know the origins of this username/nickname? Is it a reference to something specific or just a made-up name? Any information would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chao Anh and Ems, Im a Viet born in Sweden in the early nineties. Probably one of the most foreign subgroup of VN people and if you ever meet one you know we are weird af, hopefully always in a good way tho. People say I dont even look Viet (In Vietnam) , but I know I'm at least 4 Nguyens generations deep and Ive been visiting my great great grandfathers tombs out there in the jungle, so I should qualify!
 But as far as Vietnamese people and culture go we are useless! We understand Vietnamese in a weird way like only spoken Vietnamese and it should be in a specific context like when you are angry af, it's very selective. And it helps if you sound like my parents, if you have different dialect then sorry không hiểu gì hết!
 I have decided to change that and start hiểu that part of me, Ive been visiting Vietnam (mainly HCM), for a few weeks at the time, for a couple of years now. And guess what my language improved a little bit! This last year Ive visited more than 12 weeks, and the idea of relocating doesn't seem too crazy to me anymore, and actually at this stage of my life kinda makes sense, its a great challenge for me personally, and I honestly feel a little bit bored and in some ways limited here in Sweden.
 So whats my problem, just move!? Well If could just move I would but I need to find qualified work first. Im a software engineer working full-stack with a couple of years experience. Im already looking at some standard stuff that might fit me through regular channels e.g. linkedIn, and I will keep looking there. But its a jungle out there, for a guy who doesn't know the job market over there it all could be a hit or miss. 
 Hopefully somebody here has been in a similar situation and can share their experience or have any good insights, or even better set me up! Help a brother from another mother come home!

 Pros and cons of both cities in relation to the above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are here travelling for a few weeks and stumbled across an amazing and fascinating scene yesterday, hoping someone can clarify what it was
 We walked around a corner near the lake in Hanoi to see a group of people shouting and frantically unloading these giant fish (I think they were carp) out of the back of a motorbike. There was a lot of flailing arms, flailing fish, commotion etc as they quickly grabbed and tossed all of the fish into the lake. Some of the fish were massive, so slippery that they were dropped onto the floor and ushered into the water by land.
 A security guard then blew his whistle and they all quickly started praying/meditating, before jumping on their bikes and riding away.
 It was pretty fascinating to watch and our best guess was that it's related to a buddhist fish ceremony. 
 Are we correct and does it happen a lot at Hoan Kiem lake? Where do they likely get the fish from if so?
 Thanks!

 I just wanted to ask if anyone here has used the Wise (formerly Transferwise) travel card in the country as a tourist? I currently live in Japan and plan to convert some money to put onto it but I’m worried about being able to use it to withdraw cash at local ATMs (as it’s my first time visiting the country and I hear most places will only take cash).
 I heard Agribank has the lowest fees (and a reasonably generous daily limit on withdrawals) so I was considering trying to use the Wise card to withdraw cash from their ATMs. Does anyone know if this will work? 
 TIA!

 It would need to be bullion so they can stick it up their ass or whatever and smuggle it wherever they are going. 
 I have to ask as it's not something I'd ever think of but it's exactly what they want to do....

 I did not get a Sim at the airport because of a post I had read earlier about someone having problems with there sim. 
 Instead I used the airports Wi-Fi to order a grab and then walked to a viettel dealer the next day which allowed me to explore the neighborhood. ( don’t forget to bring your passport 😬)
 I got a 30 day prepaid plan with voice and 4G LTE data for 170,000 VND which is 7.24 USD I have no idea how many gigs I get but I use it to FaceTime my friends and parents and listen to Spotify. Might hotspot if I get this online teaching gig but I’ll keep my 🤞. Anyways…
 (This doesn’t include the 60,000 VND it cost for the grab rides to and from the Viettel store because I had forgotten my passport at the hotel. 😂)
 I did walk a total of 4 miles that day and felt pretty amazing afterwards so it was worth it 🙃🥳
 I look forward to the weekend and exploring District 1. So far the people here have been awesome and I really feel welcomed!

 Bình Thành, Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam
 Now the scenario goes this way, In this village lets say there was a natural disaster recently and I have to construct a housing system for 75 families that will at least last next 3 generations. 
 Regarding this i would highly appreciate if you can answer my question. Even great if someone's originally from there. 
  
what are the typical housing system there?
 what about common disaster that i have to take in account
 family structure?
 environmental advantages and dis advantages 
 what if i was to reconstruct those family's near a flowing water supply like river/ canal...would it be possible or logical? 
 hospitality of people among themselves?
  
That's it for now. Please, any sort of help I'll really appreciate: paragraphgs, artcles, images(even greater) but anything is fine. Thanks a lot.

 I'm travelling to HCMC next month and looking for local music venus where they invite indie, alternative, rock or techno musicians. I only recently found out the hidden gems thanks to Saigon Supersound.
 I could find some conventional clubs or bars but they don't seem to care much about music but only attract thousands of uninteresting tourists.
 Any insider's information about clubs, cafes, bars, concerts or music festivals are much welcomed. If you know communities, websites or magazines that'll be also awesome!
 I'd appreciate your recommendation or tips on how to explore the local underground music scene.
 Thank you so much!

 It’s 9am and I’m biking through the rice fields in Hoi An. A scooter drives past me and stops ahead about 10 meters. The guy gets off and heads to the side of the road. I know what this is cause I have ridden by men peeing a couple times now. 
 But this time was different. He was turned towards me at 45° angle and holding his erect junk in his hands. His face was turned towards me. I gasped and looked away and then covered my face and eyes as I rode past him. Luckily I don’t think he followed me. 
 Wtf!???? Is this common???

I'm a local from Saigon, looking to rent a quality bike for some road trip riding. Preferably something like the Exciter or Winner because I'll be riding into the mountains in Central highlands.
 Rental duration probably 3 weeks or so. But mainly, I'm hoping to find somewhere that can offer a bit of flexibility, because you never know what happens on a road trip. A plus point would be towing/recovery insurance just in case.

 This summer my friend and I are traveling to Hanoi for three days. I have been doing a lot of research and scouring this subreddit looking for help with things to do. I know three days is not a lot of time but I am torn about whether a trip to Ha Long Bay is worth it. It looks absolutely stunning but I know it is a hike to get there from Old Quarter of Hanoi. Was wondering for people who have been to Hanoi -- is two days sufficient to see the main sights? or given our limited time the day trip to Ha Long isn't worth it? Would appreciate any insight from people who have been. Thank you and looking forward to my trip!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello I’m not really sure if this is right place to post and please let me know of there is somewhere better to post about this 
 Long story short I am Australian and my dad (54M) started dating a Vietnamese woman (37F) right before Covid. How they met I believe was through an ex of his who was also Vietnamese. My dad went overseas a few times in 2019/2020 to visit her before Covid hit and the obviously couldn’t travel again. Then in late 2022 he moved the woman and her kid here into the family home despite myself and brother having never met them 
 I am aware he was sending her money while she was overseas and since they have arrived in Australia money is a big source of argument. I believe he is still sending money to her family and that his wife still has a Vietnamese bank account and has asked for his password to his bank account. She has brought up multiple times to me that she had looked to live elsewhere in Australia or go back to Vietnam once the date is up that they meet their visa requirements 
 This all seems very concerning to me but I’m interested to hear from the Vietnamese community if this is normal or if she is just using my dad for a visa and is going to leave?
 *Forgot to add they legally got married in Australia in February 2023. Did the fake wedding in Vietnam in 2022 which was to appease family apparently. My brother and I weren’t invited or asked to attend but then randomly two days before got asked write a speech for this woman we had never never met…

 I want to get a electricity regulator but wife keeps saying not to. Main reason is she says electricity will be much more expensive. I ask her how much more but she isn't able to say.
 Does anyone know? So the reasoning is that let's say you use 1 million a month usually, with the regulator, it will make the electricity proper voltage so using more electricity even though your using the same.
 How much of an increase do you think that will be?

 This isn't a shit post or post to vent but more so a question of if it gets better or not.

 Edit: So I waited untill 01:30 before waking him up. The guy was a heavy sleeper, I had to make so much noise. He got up, apologized and gave me my laundry back - it was right under the counter, I could have just grabbed it 😭

 I'm travelling to Vietnam later this year and wanted to take my medication with me. The issue is that it requires a prescription which I dont have since I got it over the counter from a different country (but it is prescription only in my current country and cant be bought in Vietnam). 
 The medication is not an addictive/abusive or psychedelic substance (so no opioids and not a adhd/anxienty/depression medication or whatever), and Im only planning to take what I need with me, so no massive quantities either.
 Would I end up having any troubles taking it to Vietnam? Im not so worried if it gets confiscated, just dont want to end up in prison or anything. Thank you in advance!

But I hear the border agents may start asking you questions if you bring a lot of electronics. I was planning to bring my work computer, personal computer, Nintendo Switch and possibly my DSLR. What do you think of this? Some friends are telling me to leave the DLSR and personal computer at home and some suggest my iPad instead of my personal computer so I'm not traveling with two computers. Any advice on this? I just prefer my personal computer for ease of use, multiple tabs, search history and research. I know I can do it all on my phone and iPad too. Also, how dangerous is it to bring your DSLR when visiting tourists areas? I know many photographers do it but I don't want to lose anything on the trip or be a target for theft of course.

 Just any advice or personal opinions/experiences would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got hit with my girlfriend on the back while we were pulling into our apartment. No oncoming traffic, I was signaling to turn left and a car hit the gas and tried passing us into where I was turning. 
 Luckily no major injuries, although I had to spend the whole morning getting checked and got some decent cuts on my feet (I guess sandals aren't the way to go).
 It was a hit an run and the police already found footage of the car that hit me. But it's all so avoidable if people just slow down. Also people on bikes need to learn how to use their signals because the car today just completely ignored mine. 
 Anyway, stay safe on the roads. I was as safe as I could've been and it still didn't matter. I guess that's the gamble you take every single day! 🎉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I suffer from occasional panic attacks and sporadic moments of severe anxiety and I'm prescribed Alprazolam for this. 
 I have been travelling for a few months and my small supply has run out so I'm looking to buy a new box. 
 Has anyone got a good address where they don't sell the fake stuff? Could be another brand as long as it is legit and not some weird concoction. 
 Before I left my doctor gave me a paper explaining that I need to take this medicine, but I don't have a prescription for more at this present time. Does the paper (signed by the doctor) indicating that I am allowed to take this medicine as needed suffice to get it? 
 Also any idea on prices? 
 Thank you all for taking the time to answer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think it’s just so common as a Viet living abroad that random people shouting out Nihao or ching-chong all just straight up asking : Are you Chinese? Are you Korean? You look Chinese … etc. While in Vietnam, if we see a white person and we want to know where they’re from, we respectfully ask: Where are you from? We did not just straight up calling them French, Canadian or some nationality. We just referred to them as ”Tây” = Westerner; or “Người nước ngoài” = People from outer countries. If you’re back people will say you black. If you’re white people say you’re white. But when your EA or SEA or random Asian they say ‘Chinese’??? 
 Asia is so diverse, there are Laos, Mongolia, Malaysia, etc. :) Especially Vietnam has a painful history fighting back from China and suffers from cultures destruction and assimilation by Chinese, the feeling is worse. 
 I wish one day everyone can be more acknowledged of racial diversity in Asia and ask them more general question like : “Which part of Asian are you from? What’s your ethnicity?” Instead of labeling people with something that we are not sure of.

My family is hiding that news from her, and I don’t feel good about it. I mean I understand their intentions of not telling my grandma that she has cancer for her mental health, etc. But it feels extra wrong because they lied to her and said that her tumor was benign. I feel like it’s fair to share the news when the time is right, so she can maybe live life a bit differently. 
 Maybe I’m just Vietnamese-American and I just don’t understand the culture. Can someone give me more perspective and understanding to this difficult situation?

 I will be playing the usual global charts English music but I think it would also be good to infuse some popular Chinese or Vietnamese songs that the couple and their families might enjoy dancing to!
 Of course I tried looking at charts on Spotify etc but I think it would be more valuable to have suggestions from native people!
 Please recommend me some songs that I can play at the wedding party.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! Today I would like to discuss some tech and apps that can improve our daily routines. There are many apps and services that already make life easier in other countries. Some countries have completely automated and digitized everyday life. For example, there are apps that help with logistics such as scheduling appointments or managing deliveries; grocery delivery apps; payment apps that make transactions quicker and more secure. Doctor's appointments, accounting services, freelance work - the list goes on. And it is not necessarily something complicated and expensive, some services are convenient and popular, although behind them is a small development team.
 So, please share the apps and services that you're excited to try. Share your experiences and opinions, and feel free to elaborate on any particular features or benefits that you found most useful. Thank you for your input!
 Who knows, maybe it will come to life soon)

 Chuyện là người nhà mình có xài thẻ Credit của VPBank, nhưng hầu như không sử dụng để thanh toán thường nhật. Trưa ngày 10/4/2023 khi kiểm tra điện thoại, người nhà mình nhận được tin nhắn từ VPBank báo thẻ Credit của mình bị trừ tổng cộng 44.488.950 đồng, chia làm nhiều đợt giao dịch như hình đính kèm. Sau đó kiểm tra tài khoản VPBank thì đúng là có bị trừ thật. Sau khi phát hiện tài khoản bị trừ gần hết hạn mức 50 triệu thì rất hoảng loạn, vì theo cảm quan thì biết là đã bị hack tài khoản rồi, đối tượng sau khi hack thành công thì dùng số tiền này để chạy quảng cáo facebook, vì tin nhắn từ VPBank báo về trên điện thoại với nội dung như vậy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering a move to Ha Giang as it is one of the colder cities in Vietnam, but I am having trouble finding long-term rental listings on Facebook and other real estate websites. I was wondering if anyone else who is an expat currently lives in Ha Giang and could offer me some advice on how to find a place to live.
 I also have some concerns about moving to a smaller city, as I currently live in Hanoi. While I am drawn to the cooler climate and natural beauty of Ha Giang, I worry about the potential challenges of living in a smaller city with fewer amenities and opportunities.
 If anyone has made a similar transition from a larger city to a smaller one in Vietnam, I would love to hear about your experience and any advice you may have. How did you adjust to the change in pace and lifestyle? What were some unexpected challenges or benefits of living in a smaller city?
 Thank you in advance for your help and insights.

 In Thailand a lot of the malls conveniently have scales that give you a pretty good reading for some pocket change.

 Are there pedestrian friendly neighborhoods that you like or would recommend?

 On the return around, I asked why is the tire deflated? Can you inflate the tire so we can have a better test?
 Their smart answer was, "It comes from the factory like that. If you want us to inflate it, you'll have to buy it first."
 Completely ridiculous. Mind you we are still evaluating and testing the product, and you want us to make a buying decision while the product is unusable? After that conversation, I noticed the handle bar was completely loose. Figures as much why my son struggle to turn the bike. I put the bike back to find another bike. The 2nd bike I found also had a handle bar that was also completely loose from the front wheel. Someone assembling the product in their department needs to be evaluated.
 Why on earth do you setup a display of bikes that are unprepared for test ride for children? Why is your smart response are that the bikes "come from the factory like that" an appropriate answer for deflated tires? And why do you expect people to buy it from you while they can't even get normal working conditions to evaluate the quality of a product?
 I didnt expect this type of low end service behavior from buying at a department store, at a big mall no less.

 I am a foreigner in Vietnam, when I buy a flight on Vietnam Airlines I have no problems because the website is well developed, but when I buy it on vietjetair, the website does not allow more than 25 characters in the given name and last name fields. I have a very long European given and last name and it doesn't fit on the form.
 I always have to shorten it and that causes me a lot of problems at the airport because while passing control they stop me saying the name in the ticket is no the same name shown in the passport, I always waste time explaining to the staff that my name doesn't fit on the form when I buy the ticket through the Web. Many times I have to wait until manager comes and tell me is ok after check my passport and explain again the issue and once I almost miss flight because they made me wait too long.
 I have contacted the company and they do not give me any solution. Anyone with the same problem?
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to the low price of high quality cigarettes and the lack of availability of cigars, I've found myself caught in the net of cigarette addiction. 
 I'm having an incredibly difficult time finding things like nicotine patches, nasal sprays, lozenges, etc.
 All I can find is a product called Oh No from Long Chau pharmacy. 
 These small little bottles of lozenges really aren't doing the trick for me. They are expensive and the bottles run out very quickly. 
 Has anybody else had success with finding a decent product around here?
 Even smokeless tobacco seems impossible to find. 
 I'm feeling desperate. 
 Thanks for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wondered why people in Vietnam seem to react differently to instances of police brutality compared to other countries? For instance, a recent video showing a policeman kicking a teenage boy while holding a gun has sparked a surprisingly positive response from some Vietnamese netizens.
 In the video, the policeman can be seen kicking the teen who is already sitting on the ground with a gun pointed at him. However, instead of outrage, some netizens have applauded the officer's actions, with comments such as "Very good beating," "Always support the police," and "I fully support the police officers like this."
 This kind of reaction might seem shocking to those of us living in the Western world, where instances of police brutality are often met with widespread outrage and condemn…]]></summary>

 ​
 Question is:
 - How to get there if I'm not going to use a rented motorcycle?
 - Is it safe to just go there using a rented motorcycle?
 - Should I book from taxi mobile application? 
 - Is commute an easy way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning to arrive in HCMC tomorrow for 2 weeks with additional week in Da Nang. Seek your quick advice:
  
SIM Card?: I have been suggested its better to not buy at the airport. Plan is to get a Grab to my hotel, check in, and then find some shop for SIM Card. However, can you recommend which SIM Card/company is better? (Just want reliable internet/data)
 
Where to exchange currency?: While airport is a no go (will exchange just enough for taxi and check in), curious if there're any specific places with great exchange rates? (Eg. SuperRich in Bangkok is known for its highly competitive exchange rate). 
 
 Or Is it feasible to withdraw money from the ATM? (Again, eg. in Bangkok, you are charged 220 THB right away for every ATM withdrawal so unless you're withdrawing chunk of cash, its just dropping money on avoidable)
  
Worth it to drive moped/bike to get around? For reference, I have driven in South Asia so I am quite used to...uh, interesting drivers.

 ​
 So some background information. I'm an American who got a B.S. Electrical Engineering degree back in 2016. After school I ended up hating electrical engineering and took a job working in media out of college, but I hated that too. Then in early 2020 I switched careers to IT and got a bunch of basic IT certifications. I have been working as IT support for the last 3 years. I am by no means an IT expert, but I at least have some idea of what I'm doing. I also enjoy the work that I do and enjoy learning new skills, which in the IT industry, there seems to be a never ending…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left my phone in my grab at around 1am. I’m able to track it using my work phone and have been following it for most of the night.
 I set my phone as lost on ‘Find My iPhone’ with the following message Chiếc iphone này bị bỏ lại sau khi nhặt, vui lòng gọi (dads phone number here) để trả lại càng sớm càng tốt hoặc chuyển đến Fusion Suites Sài Gòn or WhatsApp (my phone number here, as I have WhatsApp on this phone instead of my personal)
 The best part is that as soon as I did that the driver did actually call my dad but unfortunately due to language constraints between the two they weren’t able to communicate effectively. 
 What’s frustrating though is that since then I have tried to call my phone multiple times and the driver has refused to pick up. 
 I have tried reaching out to grab via their helpline but the phone line keeps getting disconnected. I am also unable to sign into my grab account on this second phone as I need Facebook 2FA and the code generator is on my personal phone. 
 Just looking for advice, support, next steps or others who have faced something similar I guess. 
 I’m worried that the phone will eventually die and I will no longer be able to track it and then all hope is lost lol.

 Already there is a language barrier they speak very little English and when I try to use a translator it seems to upset them and they try to communicate with me in small phrases but obviously I lose meaning of what they try to say and they lose meaning of what I try to say.
 So far he has gotten mad at me twice, one for walking upstairs wit my shoes on and another by attempting to contact his wife without going through him.
 At this point I think I’m just culturally missing some elements that he is starting to take as disrespect, I have to talk to them again at their house in a few days and I’m not trying to get cursed out again in Vietnamese pls help.

 I'm half Chinese and half Vietnamese living in Europe. In China you don't really say thank you. You just downplay it or deny it playfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am visiting HCMC in early June, partially as a vacation but partially to learn more about the local scene for entrepreneurs and freelancers. I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I'm strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.
 As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I'm not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.
 Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats? Anyone here running their own small business or online business in Vietnam and would like to meet for a coffee or beer?
 Thanks for reading!

 I am currently travelling around Vietnam with my girlfriend and we are in Ninh Binh where it is raining today tomorrow with some thunderstorms(apparently) and I am just wondering what are common indoor activities or that when it is raining so much?
 Is it similar to other countries like bowling/cinema in bigger cities or is there some more localised activities?
 If anyone has any suggestions for Ninh Binh I'd be very thankful but it just made me think about everywhere else around the country too.

 I have almost 2 years internship experience with multinational corporations on top of my degree. I’m mostly interested in positions involving cloud, DevOps, networking and operating systems, rather than full time software development. 
 How easy would it be for a non Vietnamese graduate to find an entry level position? What would a reasonable monthly wage be? I’ve seen positions ranging from $900-2500, and was wondering what an acceptable range for negotiation would be. Lastly, are there any specific websites I can look for jobs? I’ve currently just been using LinkedIn, Glassdoor and indeed. 
 Thank you in advance for your help 🙏

Would like to take a train from Central Vietnam to HCM (about 12 hours ride) and take a plane from there later. Found a coonection with 4 hours arrival in HCM before the plane leaves. Is that a possible thing to do or do I need a lot of luck?
 Option b would be to arrive early in HCM airport and stay there over night, though not sure if thats recommended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was on Ta Hien street last night and was planning to just walk (ten minutes) to the hotel but the obnoxious cab drivers would not stop pestering me so I just took a taxi. I told the driver my hotel name and he started driving and then takes me to like four different hotels and each time I say this is not my hotel.
 Finally he asks to use my phone for google maps and I hate handing my phone over but was tired and starting to feel sick. I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn't hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.
 He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn't) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn't even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.
 POLICE are zero help because I don't remember the drivers cab number. Is there ANYTHING I can do? My phone is not showing on the findmyiphone app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I often get these friend requests from attractive looking Vietnamese female profiles on Facebook. Sometimes they are from Vietnam and sometimes they are in the US. They would chat with me and reveal their scam by trying to get me to sell random stuffs for them on some scam sites that give them commissions. I think they themselves believe that those scam sale sites are legit. 
 Another scam is they say they trade options to make money on the side and can help me make money, I never let it go further than that so I don’t know exactly how they do it. However, 90% of them would just chat and talk to me for weeks and months. I entertain them and keep talking to them to see what the scam is but it never comes. I talk to them like a normal respectful person but never show them that I am thirsty. Eventually they just stop talking to me. 
 The one thing in common I noticed is that they would edit old photo posts from months and years ago. Why do this? Is it their way of establishing that the profile is legit because they have posts from years ago? Is there ever a legit reason for someone to edit photos from a couple years ago? I am just trying to understand what is it they want from me or what kind of scam it is because it is a lot of time and efforts they go through. Thank you guys.

 I am always very careful when inputting the pickup address and drop a pin exactly where I am on the map. But when I go to find them I am walking up and down the street and can't see them.
 I have a 4G sim. Am I doing something wrong or is the app location a bit off sometimes?

I lived in Hanoi for a couple of years where my learning was very minimal and since moving back to Europe, I would like to improve my level. 
 I take online lessons but the time zones make it a bit difficult with a teacher based in Vietnam, so it limits my lessons to an hour a week.
 If anyone here knows anyone that would be able to help me, or point me in the right direction, that'd be perfect. They don't need to be a qualified teacher, just someone who I could practice with, and is able to explain about the grammar/pronunciations aspects.
 Thanks in advance!

 Did I create a false memory in my head or something? It's driving me crazy!
 I've been in Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An and Da Lat if that helps. Is it a regional thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I LOVE Vietnamese food and have been indulging in every dish I can find. However, both me and my gf noticed we have extremely smaller appetites here as compared to home (USA).
 I suppose I've been doing slightly less excercisey things (i.e no lifting weights) but we still walk probably a couple miles a day. Plus, I feel like I can go into bottomless pit mode at home when I'm just being a couch potato. 
 Anyone else experience this? For the record, I eat a relatively healthy diet back in the states so I dont think it's due to me consuming less processed foods.

I guess the only plus is that it made me realize how much I absolutely love Dalat, Hôi An, and Phong Nha.

While looking for the best places to stay during raining season I came across Cat Ba Island. Beautiful area, less touristy then Halong Bay while still having plenty of restaurant options and other things to do. 
 However, when looking at the weather forecast for august it says there could be monsoons and very heavy rain. Is this still doable or would it be cloudy and raining for most of the day? 
 Other suggestions are also really appreciated!

 I was confused because I always considered it a sort of Pride specially because here in south America as the history of Vietnam has always been a inspiration for us. 
 I'm also quite embarrassed, I have a friend from Vietnam and I've been using this term for a while, well this friend never said anything against it, this is what makes me even more confused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering Lasik eye surgery in Saigon. The last post here re Lasik was a few years ago and I'm wondering if anyone here has had the procedure done more recently than that? Cao Thang Eye Hospital looks good.
 Hoping to get recommendations for hospital and costs as well as actual recovery time and follow up appointments.
 As a solo traveller is the recovery something that you can get through on your own? Is it as simple as having a hotel to stay at for the following night and arranging a lift from the hospital back to the hotel?
 What about follow up appointments, I'm not overly keen on staying in HCMC for too long. How about heading to Danang the following day and checking back in at HCMC on the way back to flying out? Were you able to swim and ride a motorbike after the procedure? I think swimming is not recommended. Just wondering what to do in recovery I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have a question about buying a DJI mini 3 pro with the RC and Fly more kit plus in Vietnam. I'll be visiting the country in about a month and I'm wondering how much it would cost to buy this product in a local store. Unfortunately, I cannot order it from the official DJI site because I'll be moving around a lot.
 Can anyone recommend the best stores to go to for purchasing this drone in Vietnam? Also, I'm a bit concerned about the legality of flying drones in Vietnam. What happens if the police catch you with a drone? Is it illegal to fly drones in certain areas of the country?
 Thank you for your help and advice in advance. I'm really looking forward to my trip to Vietnam and I'd love to capture some amazing footage with my new drone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 My fiancée and I are planning to take a trip out to Nha Ttrang in September/October. My company does not give me much vacation time - only 3 weeks a year - so for this trip, I am only looking to spend about 7-ish days in VietNam, with a few of them specifically in Nha Trang.
 I make a fairly good income at my job - just shy over $100K USD - and I'm not reluctant to spend $130-$180 a night at a nice hotel with my fiancée. Unfortunately we are in the process of waiting for a Visa, so do not see one another that frequently. My fiancée doesn't care too much about fancy accommodations since she grew up fairly frugal, but I don't mind spending the extra $$ because I'm a little spoiled.
 Anyways, what is everyone's favourite luxury hotel in Nha Trang? We we will be taking a flight from HCM. The 40-50min drive from the airport isn't a deal breaker, so the hotel does not necessarily need to be in a convenient in-between location from airport and the night market.
 We've looked up a few spots already; Queen Ann, Ariyana SmartCondotel, and Panorama by HLG.
 The biggest thing I'm looking for is a comfortably-sized shower for additional intimacy.

 Australia getting pretty grim with high interest rates and corporate owned houses for renting, rich boomer generation buying multiple houses to rent out and rich overseas investors buying 5+ houses to rent out. A lot more homeless around nowadays. 
 But our salaries are alright, even a waiter can afford a house if we save good for 3-5 years, we could probably get a mortgage that will take a life time to pay off.
 I went over to vietnam and found out that salaries can be 250k to 500k VND, depending on location. But the property prices are equivalent to USA and Aus. 
 Not everyone will have corporate jobs or be in a financial situation to afford these prices.
 How is it looking for those who are starting from scratch? No family to assist, just a normal everyday job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 After searching the subreddit, I've seen several questions about short layovers in HCMC (5-6 hours max). Most of the consensus I've read is that Tan Son Nhat makes that short of a stopover risky, and best to stay in the airport. However, in June I'll be flying in on my way back to Australia and I'll have 10 hours of stopover time from landing to the next departure.
 I already went ahead and got a visa, so that should speed things up. If I factor in 30 min to 1 hour for customs, another 30 minutes or so into the city centre via taxi, and then 30 min to get back to the airport 3 whole hours before my international departure, that still leaves me with potentially 5 hours in HCMC. Worth it in my book! I never thought I'd get to set foot in Vietnam so I'm excited to take the opportunity.
 Where's the best area to wander for 5-ish hours in HCMC? Try some local Vietnamese dishes, get a bit of a sense of what the city is like, any quick interesting sights, etc. I'll be there on a Friday if that makes a difference for any markets or things that will be open.
 Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was the 3rd Mongol invasion of Vietnam, along the Bạch Đằng river. The Viets positioned themselves in small flotilla along the river, and made a false retreat drawing the Mongol fleet into the trap.With the Yuan fleet trapped, the Vietnamese junks armed with bombs, attacked them from all sides. Many of the Mongols jumped into the river to save themselves were killed or drowned. The Viet captured around 400 Yuan warships.
 This victory effectively put an end to the Mongol invasions of Vietnam, though the Viet monarch Trần Nhân Tông, decided to accept the supremacy of Kublai Khan to avoid further conflicts.The failure of the Mongol invasions was however a shattering blow for their supremacy in Asia, and Vietnam's success gave more confidence to the other Asian nations to halt the once invincible Mongol juggernaut.

 Ticket prices are issued at 120,000 VND/ticket for international visitors and 80,000 VND/ticket for domestic visitors. Such a two-price policy that distinguishes between domestic and foreign people, dating back several decades, is completely out of line with international practices. 
 There are two types of spaces that need to be clearly defined, where the proposed toll is public space or owned space (eg museums, monuments...). If the space is owned, the owner has the right to collect a fee. On the contrary, if it is a public space, it belongs to the whole people, belongs to everyone, and has no right to collect fees. 
 Hoi An sells entrance tickets, in the case of legality, on the one hand, it brings the city's budget but on the other hand increases the cost of tourists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im flying to Da Nang from Hanoi this week, and I’m traveling all of Southeast Asia, so I brought my drone (DJI mavic mini) to film in places where it is allowed. I read some horror stories online about drone confiscation at Da Nang airport, and I’m really afraid for my drone now. I always keep the batteries separate (they are my powerbank when traveling) and I’m flying domestic, I have never heard any issues with domestic flights but I just wanted to be sure.

 Please recommend me some Vietnamese songs!! I must say that I am not a fan of the Vietnamese music genre(???). You know! Long, drawn-out words with vibrato, sung along with some sort of stringed instrument (sorry mom!!!). 
 I want songs with Vietnamese lyrics, but in another style. Rock & Pop-Rock are my preferred genres. Fast, upbeat! And I don't care what the lyrics say as long as they are in Vietnamese. 
 Artists/Projects I like: Kagerou Project, Weezer, Wallows, Sex Bob-Omb 
 Please do recommend me something!!! Thank you :D
 edited to change pop to pop-rock*

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

 I do not have time to cook my food.
 I just go to cheap shops or street food.
 In the street, I see them offering food like rice, fish, chicken, etc.
 When I walk in the street, I just eat the food. 
 In the English speaking Countries, it is not recommend to eat outside due to how processed and expensive the food it is.
 Here in Vietnam, the food is so cheap. However, is the food healthy? Do they use cheap oil to cook? Do they use a lot of oil?
 Thanks!

 I recently moved to Hanoi, Vietnam, to start a new chapter here. I love this place so much but I find myself often confused on how many options I have for grocery shopping, and it got me thinking about where could I find the best prices of groceries in spite of being a foreigner. I have got some names of some supermarkets but I was wondering If I could go even cheaper to buy groceries. If anyone here has any idea I would really appreciate it and hopefully others coming to Vietnam can benefit from this post if someone drops any value here.
 Thank you and have a nice day

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the time I’ve been here in Vietnam, I’ve come across Falun Gong/Falun Dafa a surprisingly high number of times, including meeting one man who practiced this who spoke English and was able to actually tell me something about this group. 
 Being from the UK, I can’t say I’ve had much actual experience with what Falun Gong is beyond the whole China situation, which as you can imagine often attracts a lot of negativity and general bad feeling. 
 I’m wondering how Falun Gong is actually viewed by Vietnamese people. I’m guessing given the amount of times I’ve come across practitioners, it’s viewed more favourably than it is in the UK or other places.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be flying to Bangkok tomorrow and just realized that I still have more than 1 million VND left. Since ATM fees in BKK are quite high anyway, I thought about exchanging my VND stock. Which would be the way of minimized loss? Exchange VND in BKK or at Hanoi airport? Or maybe change to USD in Hanoi and then to Baht in Bangkok? Happy about helping input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently in Vietnam and need help getting a book. The book is "This One Wild and Precious Life: The Path Back to Connection in a Fractured World by Sarah Wilson".
 I can't find it on any Vietnamese websites, so my question is, what are the best international websites to buy and ship to Vietnam. 
 My current plan is to order it to my home in the UK, and have someone ship it to me here, surely there is a better option. 
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been going out on dates here in HCMC with a girl who, though she has lived in HCMC since university, is originally from the city of Tay Ninh. Her family apparently follows Cao Dai. She herself says she has no religion, though she is quite interested in Buddhist philosophy and often reads Buddhist-flavored self-help books (like Thich Nhat Hanh and Haemin Sunim).
 Anyway, she's incredibly kind, fun-loving, philosophical, selfless, and more. I'm just wondering whether coming from a family that follows Cao Dai is like the Vietnamese equivalent of a Mormon family, a Scientology family, or really just no big deal? Is there anything I should be aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m planning a trip this October to Vietnam with my boyfriend for our birthdays for about 2.5 weeks. His birthday is the 18th and mine the 24th! For additional context, He is a city guy and I’m more of a nature and landscape gal. We both like water. So based on that I was curious which itinerary anyone would anyone recommend in mid October taking into account the central region rainy season. We also want to ensure we have the most sun/best warm weather in the islands.
 I’m not sure on the amount of days yet in each place so any recommendations are welcome :) also are there any “must see” places I am missing that would fit into the below with the amount of time we have? Thank you!! 
 Itinerary 1 Land in Hanoi-> Sapa-> Halong Bay -> hoian? (Not sure if I should avoid due to rain) Fly to Ho Chi Minh -> Phu Quoc islands then back to Ho Chi Minh to fly home 
 Itinerary 2 Land in Hochiminh -> Phu Quoc islands -> back to Ho Chi Minh-> fly to Hanoi -> Sapa -> Halong bay -Hanoi and any day trips from there then fly home from Hanoi
