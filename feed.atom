But the GDP per capita is still low, ranking at 117th_per_capita) and they are still dependent on foreign ODA. So when do you think they can reach the same level as other SEA countries Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia?

 Quick question again, basically I have very specific hair needs since I have nice, natural curly hair. There is a specific moisture cream that makes my curls extremely luxurious that I really cannot do without now. Because otherwise my hair will be very dry and frizzy and coarse. 
 My question, would my package either be seized or held up with customs when shipping the product? Mind you, I will not be shipping any electronics or perishables (food) or anything like this ever, I would only ever need to order skin/hair care from South Korea to Vietnam. The shop I order from is KoreaDepart, they ship everywhere, however my question is not with them it’s about can I get the products into Vietnam without being seized or held up and having to pay out the ass in fees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see posts a lot where it is usually a foreigner marrying a girl from VN. However, does anyone have experience with marrying a man from VN as a foreigner?
 I'm not really a foreigner either, I'm a VK but don't speak vietnamese at all, but I do speak a chinese dialect and was able to get around a little in VN when I was there for 1 month. During that time, I met someone that is too perfect. We aren't dating, just friends, we met accidently. His family runs a little food shop/stand and I couldn't speak Vietnamese so he stepped in to help and we just started talking since I was there during slow business time.
 Prior to that I also thought about moving to VN to stay closer to family. I also like VN but I feel like I am romanticizing it too much and the reason I like it is because I can escape from my problems (work burnout).
 ​
 I don't really know what I really want to ask. I just want to hear from people about their experience. Since men and women in VN can be different in a relationship because of culture. I don't want to start a relationship and get his hopes up since he is older than me with aging parents.

 Does anyone know how to get your social security insurance contributions or a law firm that could help? 
 I am moving back to the states and was told by my HR Rep that the government can only give me a plaque/certificate with the years worked, not MONEY
 I am owed a decent amount of money and the government has refused to pay, I heard this was also a problem in china but know of friends getting their money there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember being very interested in Vietnam's Tay Son period ever since I was as young as 7, and I remember always feeling extremely unwell hearing about all these Tay Son bloodlines and everything, including famous generals like Bùi Thị Xuân and her daughter getting stomped to death by elephants. Or the ensuing executions of Nguyễn Nhạc's children by having them sawed in half. Despite it being years later, I still feel sad reading about the infamous Nguyen Lord and later Gia Long's rampage against Quang Trung's monarch. But then It is also my responsibility to be aware that part of his bloodlust was also due to the fact that he had witnessed the killings against his own family when the Tay Son swept down South.
 Humans are scary.
 If anyone else has any insight or corrections which I know will be inevitably pointed out, I would totally love to hear them and see what else I needed to learn about this event.

 I don’t eat pork or shellfish , and would prefer not to eat any other meat such as chicken or beef. 
 How easy will it be to find options that are ‘chay’ when I am out exploring? How easy will it be to avoid fish sauce, which I know contains shrimp, for example? 
 Is there anything I could buy in a supermarket that is vegetarian that I could quickly grab and go, if I’m in a hurry ?
 Many thanks! 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking into getting a loan in Vietnam as a foreigner for a property purchase. 
 Did not have much luck with banks. Most do not offer loans for foreigners, or people living outside of HN or SG. Vietnam Russia Bank (VRB) seemed to be the easiest for foreigners. 
 I then found Homebase and it seemed too perfect. But the more I read about them in both English and Vietnamese media, the more they seem legit. Though it's hard to find much reviews from customers that aren't their own promotional material.
 Does anyone know of any experiences with them? Interested hearing both Vietnamese and foreigner experiences.
 If not familiar, they work like: they initially buy the property and own it, then you buy it back from them at a pre-agreed upon price (at any time). You're allowed use the property while buying back.

I was directed to the office but a guy stepped up yo me and offered to get me a pcr test to let me fly for $200. In a panic, i agreed and he did some stuff and got me the test, but the gate was closed. So basically i had to buy a flight ticket to Osaka for a little bit later ($455) because i was told i couldn’t get any refund or transfer for the ticket i had + my visa for Vietnam was over today. I then had to pay the guy 4 mil for the pcr and sprinted to make my flight. In addition, new flight from Osaka Just ran into another guy in Osaka who was at the airport and he said the fake pcr was not only 150 but i could have just paid 1 mil to have my ticket changed until i could get a real pcr test for cheap. I feel like an idiot although i know i was just panicked and wanted nothing more than to make it to Tokyo so I’m out $700 extra dollars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I have been reading about the Doi Moi policy, which the Communist Party or Vietnam (CPV) implemented in 1986. 
 A lot of articles and videos I found on the Internet tend to praise the policy for transforming Vietnam into a rising economy in the ASEAN region, surpassing my country (the Philippines) and others in terms of economic growth and development. 
 I even watched a video from Bloomberg about how North Korea once planned of adopting Vietnam-style reforms to open and grow its economy before the COVID-19 pandemic.
 So I want to know what this sub thinks of Doi Moi. Should other developing countries like the Philippines and North Korea follow Vietnam's example? Was it effective in bringing prosperity to Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m curious, has anyone ever been to “Tuyết Thành” - outside of Saigon? What’s it like? How hard is it to get to from Saigon?
 “Tuyết Thành, or "Snowy Citadel" in English, is a city located just 35 kilometers outside of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite being situated in a tropical region, Tuyết Thành is renowned for its year-round snowfall, which is a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for years.”
 “The snow in Tuyết Thành is a stunning sight to behold, falling softly from the sky to create a winter wonderland that is both surreal and magical. The snow is powdery and light, making it perfect for building snowmen or engaging in snowball fights. The cause of this phenomenon remains a mystery, but locals speculate that it's due to a unique combination of climatic and geographic factors. Nonetheless, Tuyết Thành is a popular destination for tourists seeking an extraordinary winter experience in Vietnam.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I recently made a post about shipping an open-box ps4 to my cuz in HCMC using an independent Viet shipper here, and it got held up at customs. That’s what the shipper told me anyway. 
 I’ve decided to ship her a brand new console in the box and everything. What shipping should I use to ensure that she’ll get it? I have UPS, FedEx, DHL, regular postal service. 
 Any tips on filling out customs paperwork and stuff to make sure it gets through? 
 If you’re wondering why I’m not giving her the money to just buy one, I got this ps5 as a gift for free so I can’t justify shelling out $500-600.
 Edit: extra words

 Anyone into it? Im new to it however i have some cash to blow on a good setup.
 Anyone buy locally or suggest any good shops? Id rather not piece ship it internationally and if i dont have to rather not buy when i head to US and put it on the plane. 
 I debated steams full setup and a new PC to run it. I am really going to focus on a realistic driver setup(minus the moving hydrolic chair stuff) and flight simulator to learn how to fly.
 Hanoi is ok to but prefer Saigon.
 Open to people commenting on setups also if they have experience since im a noob to it all

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to order a few unique accessories for a VR headset from abroad, and I've never in my life used websites like amazon/ubuy/etc. 
 I'm not familiar with shipping to Vietnam and wanted to get some insights here from the people who have experience with this.
 Which service would you recommend (Amazon, etc.)? Would it be 100% reliable? What obstacles might exist there? And is it as easy as simply ordering on the website and waiting for delivery, or would I need to personally contact customs to pay any extra fees? 
 I live in Central Vietnam so it would not be possible for me to go to Hanoi or HCMC to deal with customs.

 I came to the US in 2005 with a passport that was issued in 2003 (expired in 2008). I am currently a permanent resident. My boss is asking me if I want to go overseas for a couple months for business trips in April. However, I do not know if I can even renew my original passport or can I just get a new one? I am near DC so I can just drive there for passport service instead of mailing documents in.

I was really set on Hanoi, but from what I have been reading it is apparently not a very walkable city. Here in the US, I do not own a car and very rarely drive. I have taken public transportation my whole life and really prefer that to owning/paying for a car.
 I am a bit freaked out by the idea of renting a scooter given how hectic the roads are, but I will do it if that's what it takes to come live in Vietnam. But I was wanting to ask how feasible is it to walk and use public transport in Hanoi, or if there is a better city that is suited for this that is not HCMC? What about places outside major cities?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im new to Reddit so not sure how to post text with pictures. After posting this incidents in some FB groups, people shared their similar experiences so it happens quite a lot. I have never thought someone dares to steal in this area where there are so many security cameras
 Summary: - Before going through security screening, I took off my watch, put it in my purse. My purse didn't have zipper or lock. Put my purse lying down next to my husband's bag, in the same tray. (XRAY MACHINE IMAGE confirmed there was watch in my purse) - My husband push the bag tray in Xray machine then went through body scan. Then another man jumped in while I was taking off my shoes. I let him since I didn't want to delay other people - I went through body scan after pushing the shoe tray in Xray - Right after that, I got my purse back from my husband at the conveyor belt. I STOOD RIGHT THERE AND SEARCHED FOR THE WATCH, it was gone. I walked a little further (about 10 steps) to avoid blocking the way and took all stuff out of my purse to search for it. Nothing - 1 minute later (YES WE HAVE CAMERA FOOTAGE), my husband went back to the conveyor belt area to check all the trays around. Found nothing - I reported the issue to the airport security team. No official report, no help from them. Later I had to fly back to Phu Quoc to make a scene and got official report and watched camera footage and Xray machine images.

 If you know good spots up in Hanoi too, that’d be cool. Willing to take any local recommendations for any dish as well. I understand that best can be difficult to define and tends to be subjective, so whatever you tell me I’ll look into.
 Thanks!

 So I'm here living with my wife and I'm trying to learn the language. Things are going quite well as far as reading and writing and speaking. But understanding what people say to me is really not going well. 
 We live in the far south, near Long Xuyên. 
 There's one sound in particular that is killing my brain, and that is the words beginning with "ch".
 All references I can find for learning the language indicate that words like chào like in xin chào are pronounced the same way we would in English, like chow, choice, chomp etc.
 Down here in the south people pronounce it with more of a g sound as in growl, gouge, graph. My wife says this is not true, but to my ear that's what it sounds like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Im currently in negotiations to work with a well established startup in vn.
 They have already received 2 rounds of funding for 12 million USD and have yearly sales of almost 50 million. They are doing well and employing around 75 people, including native engineers and many skilled factory workers. 
 After this month of brutal internet, the series B round funders have issued an ultimatum for them to move design out of vietnam immediately. This was very embarrassing after a month of video call after video call was dropped; we were having a terrible time accessing code repositories hosted out of country, and a bunch of other problems due to new products relying on cloud connectivity. 
 the investors are foreign, frankly they have little faith in whats going on here. They seem to believe its not just a coincidence of all the internet cables but one breaking down; but rather a systematic problem, either in infrastructure, or govt mismanagement. They visited earlier this month, met with city officials in ho chi minh, and were appalled at the attitude, as well as conditions around the city, and believe growth in a high tech field will only be impeded by being here. 
 Frankly i cant argue. I love what we are working on and hate to have to turn away from this myself, but while they can work hard and compete, they will always be be hamstrung by access to real talent, and the 2nd world infrastructure. There is a culture of inefficiency in vn thinking that fester these kinds of problems. But founder is a rare brilliant vietnamese engineer who came home to make something good here, and looks like they wont be able to stay. 
 Come on vn, get your shit together.

Also I was the only one in the store, it was early morning. What are your feelings on this, would you consider it rude or disrespectful? I wouldn't try this if they were busy, or if I knew the person was born here, I just like the feedback and maybe it would make them feel more welcomed and make them remember their home country?
 I'm not sure, have at me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning to travel to Vietnam, from India for 8-9 days with my parents in mid April. We are mostly looking for mountains or a place with pleasant weather in April. I have narrowed down to below places, but my parents can not trek, due to bad knees. Also we dont want it to be a hectic trip and want some time to enjoy a place as well. Can you please suggest me the places I can skip ? Vietnam : 1. Hanoi 2. Sapa 3. Ninh binh 4. Halong bay 5. Cat ba island 6. Mai chau 7. Pu luong 8. Moc chau 9. Ha giang
 Also, country other than Vietnam is also welcome(except Europe,since we can travel for 9 days only) .

 Hello there I’m not Vietnamese but I stumble upon a video on Facebook about a case of a pet salon where the workers unprofessionalism ended up in a dog’s death, by doing my research I found the original video on YouTube it’s called chewy hung to death at a pet spa by Brent Strydom (I really recommend not watching the video as it was incredibly graphic and horrible to see what happens to the dog) the user called Brent strydom seems to have been the owner of chewy and was claiming justice for what happened, it was uploaded on 2017 so idk if it got resolved or not since comments are deactivated and he didn’t left any social media on his channel to contact him so if anyone may know something about this case please let me know

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know it's partly because of the CSGT not enforcing traffic laws, but in Australia and I assume other places at least 2/3 of the reason people follow traffic rules is because the public will publicly shame you if you don't and if you're unlucky someone will punch your face in. But it seems even the good drivers in Vietnam just roll over and accept it when someone tries to murder them on the roads.

The shipper says it’s in the warehouse at the airport pending some customs issues. They didn’t explain a lot. I shipped electronics before with no problems. Should I just assume that it’s lost at this point? The shipper said to wait 2-3 weeks. It’s coming up on 3 weeks and they’re not returning my calls. 
 Anyone encountered this issue? Are there specific products that warrant more scrutiny?

However, our trip might have to be pushed back a few weeks, and I’m worried about the start of the rainy season interfering with good driving/riding conditions. My partner and I both have decent experience on motorbikes, but we haven’t decided if we want to do the EasyRider option or drive ourselves. Any input on weather considerations for the overall experience would be amazing!

 We are four friends who are planning a trip to Southeast Asia between December 2023 and January 2024. As we begin to plan our itinerary, we are hoping to find a relaxing spot where we can unwind and swim towards the end of our trip.
 We've heard so much about the natural beauty of your countries and we would love to experience it firsthand. As described in the post on r/laos linked below, we would like to do a wild experience in the first weeks. We are hoping to find a beach or lake where we can enjoy some peace and quiet at the end of our travel. We are also hoping to find a spot with some amenities nearby, like restaurants or shops, but we don't want anything too crowded or touristy.
 We would really appreciate any recommendations you might have for a relaxing spot where we can swim and unwind during our trip. We are open to any and all suggestions, so please feel free to share your favorite spots and hidden gems with us.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

 I'm hopping on a plane
 Leaving right away
 My heart's set on a different name
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 My flip-flops and my shorts
 Are waiting at the door
 To explore every hidden nook
 Of Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's never been too clean
 Where the traffic's like a symphony
 And the street food's obscene
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's got its own soundtrack
 With motorbikes and horns and shouting
 And sunsets that take my breath
 ​
 Verse 2:
 I'm ready to escape
 This monotonous place
 And see how life's done in the East
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 From Pho to Banh Mi
 And everything in between
 The food here is so divine
 In Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 Where coffee's a religion
 And there's so much life on every street
 That I feel pure elation
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That never seems to sleep
 Where locals bike and tourists gawk
 And the air's a little too thick
 ​
 Bridge:
 If I can make it here
 I'll make it anywhere
 It's up to you
 Saigon, Saigon
 ​
 Chorus:
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's got its own kind of magic
 With history that's felt at every turn
 And energy that's so classic
 ​
 I want to wake up in a city
 That's got its own style and flair
 With markets that hustle and bustle
 And a pulse that's beyond compare
 ​
 Outro:
 Saigon, Saigon
 I wanna wake up in a city that screams my name
 Saigon, Saigon
 Where the hustle and bustle is always insane.

 First of all the staff are excellent. Friendly and helpful check in agent and driver. 
 Have no issue whatsoever with the customer service. For that this vendor earns three stars. 
 Areas of improvement:
 VIP bus was messy. Had water bottles and trash from previous guests. Mini van was a little worn. Not as pristine as the photos but not terrible either. 
 Where Cuc Tung looses stars is the driving experience. It was terrifying. The driver took unnecessary risks. There was low visibility due to fog and rain. Other travelers pulled off unto the side of the road but our driver's speed barely slowed down around the twists and turns of the mountain two lane highway And, he regularly passed cars while in blind curves. It was three a* clenching hours I was thankful to have survived. 
 Safety should be a higher priority than timeliness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone know if it is real jade being sold at the tip of Ngu Hanh Son (Marble Mountain) in Da Nang? Where are they sourced?
 I went to most stalls in the area, even the small street vendors and they all claim that the jade they sell is real. I am just curious about the authenticity because their jade were selling for only a fraction of what it would cost in gold stores. For example, some ranged between 50k - 1 mill. Also, what is the deal with the price difference? I assume some may be either fake or real. If anyone is familiar with the area, some advice on where to find an authentic dealer is highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few questions about the housing market in HCMC. I’m really just asking out of curiosity since I can’t actually purchase a SFR in Vietnam. Reading about Seoul’s fucked-up housing situation kind of freaks me out so I’m kind of curious about what’s happening in HCMC. 
 My aunt “recently” sold their childhood house in D3 of HCMC for ~$500K USD. This is just what I overheard so I could honestly be mistaken, but this seems like a crazy amount for someone in VN to purchase considering the average annual salary of someone in HCMC. The only thing that stands out about this house to me is that it’s unlike the standard tall, narrow row houses with 4+ floors and had two floors, was much “wider” than it was tall, and had a backyard. It was a little out of place relative to the other structures around it. 
 Is this “standard” pricing throughout most of HCMC? Sorry, I know this is a particularly stupid question since HCMC is massive. 
 Do most people in HCMC “dream” about purchasing single family residences or has the goal shifted to purchasing a nice condo? Another family member told me that you can reasonably expect a newer condo to go for about ~$80K USD which still seems disproportionately high for the average salary, but I don’t know. 
 Who is still able to purchase a “house” or a “condo”? 
 Would you say the majority of people in HCMC today were born and raised there or moved there in the last 20 or so years?

 I have a Samsung Galaxy A52 Android phone running on Viettel. I'm planning to travel to the US and I want to us my phone with one of the carriers there. I checked T-Mobile and my phone's technology and band appear to be compatible. But I don't know if my phone is unlocked, or how to unlock it.
 I bought it in Danang from one of the big electronic stores. There are three A52 models. Mine is the regular A52 that does not support 5G. Model SM-A525F/DS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends- a friend and I have both realized we have some recollection of a cover of "The Rain" by Orange Juice Jones in Vietnamese existing, and that it was not a freak fever dream from our childhood.
 We are desperate to find it because it is exactly what you would expect from similar covers. (Thai Tai's "Never Gonna Give You Up" cover is peak 90s cheesy and unexpected.) I am actively combing through my playlists and discography to find it, and am wondering if the song goes by a different title in Vietnamese.
 I recall it was Trung Hanh or someone similar who sang it, but I cannot accurately recall.
 Thanks in advance,
 Keru

 Many shops tape up your bag with sticky tape when you buy something.
 Some shops staple your receipt to the bag.
 etc.
  
My question is not why such practices exist (presumably all are somehow intended to minimize theft) and what they might indicate about society---that has been discussed here before.
 Instead, my question is where and how they originated. Can anybody shed light on where, how and when these practices became widespread in VN---and how they spread to become ubiquitous across the country?
 (Obviously these practices are not all unique to VN; that's irrelevant.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm long-term renting a house here in VN and like most other houses there is a large-ish altar built in to a wall (complete with switched yellow lights) and another altar above the kitchen hearth. 
 I'm not Vietnamese and so the concept of ancestor veneration is totally foreign to me, but I appreciate that it's a part of the culture here. In my own house though, I really don't care. So the kitchen alter is currently holding spices, and the main home alter is bare (I was thinking it'd be good for books and knickknacks).
 My question: Am I going to offend someone or put them off if they visit my house? Am I exposing myself to some supernatural peril? I've previously lived in places with a mezuzah and Mary in a clamshell and don't see how this is different, but my landlady is nice and if using an alter as a spice rack is disrespectful I don't want to rock the boat.

 As I understand however, Thuy Nga has been struggling to expand it's audience base. The younger generation especially in the US is not as tied into the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War so those older songs ( aren't that appealing ). DVD sales are useless now. And the " Young " Singers that Thuy Nga has; well for one thing, they're not that good at singing, and they're not " Young ". One of Thuy Nga's " Young " Singers, Diem Suong is 33 years old. And Nhu Loan is 41. 
 Enter Myra Tran. She was not recruited by Thuy Nga. But rather, came to them through American Idol. She's now ( so far at least ) doing pretty well in Vietnam, while having some success in the US with Paris By Night.
 ​
 What do you guys think ? Can Thuy Nga adapt to new audience through Myra Tran ?

I'm only concerned about the car having a level 2 automated driving system ( I get used to in my country before) or full speed acc. My Vietnamese wife told me when the car was imported to Vietnam, they will cut off this function. But I believe some brands probably can find it.
 Can you recommend a car brand or model that has this system? Thank you a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our tour bus just got into an accident on the way from Hanoi to Ha Giang. Everyone involved is safe. I'm pretty pissed at the driver and bus company though. Driver was driving like an asshole and I'm not surprised we got into an accident at all. Do I have any recourse here? They put us on another bus that only has room on the floor for the next 4 hours. I would expect some kind of compensation or money back for dealing with this, but as a non-vietnamese speaker I don't know what chance I'll have to actually get that.
 Edit: The bus company is Ngọc Cường VIP
 It was a head on collision with a commercial delivery truck

When I'm doing research it seems to me that tourist accommodation on beach destinations mostly are big hotels, tall buildings with all sorts of ammeneties, A/C and so on. I'm curious if there are any areas of Vietnam where the types of rustic low key bungalows/chalets common on e.g. island beaches in Thailand, are the norm?
 Thank you very much for your help and opinions 😊

 Please, help me understand how Vietnam railways work, as I'm severely confused...
 I'm planning on visiting Vietnam in April, and wanted to book SE3 overnight train from Ninh Binh to Dong Hoi in advance. The problem is: I get different options depending on which website I use.
 If I try official dsvn.vn I can book a bed in 6-beds car, operated by, as far as I understand Vietnam Railways itself:
 https://preview.redd.it/wxgfmsgvj0ja1.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=246be640edd3e9d999b8fc3d4658c29828db0bb6
 If I search through baolau.com, I am presented with 4-Berth sleeping cabin, operated by New Livitrans Express:
 https://preview.redd.it/7zruwhogk0ja1.jpg?width=1143&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c6e0b44d9e051972fdff8c43c82546deb1438e3
 Finally, 12go.asia shows two separate trains, seemingly departing at the very same time: one operated by Vietnam Railways, another by Violette Express Train. Both seems to offer 4-Berth Sleepers?
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/yqnx4uq8l0ja1.jpg?width=1147&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32b9b500ac10f136f14364c06286222c51c4c4bb
 Whom should I trust? Is it a single train with carts by different operators?
 Any help will be greatly appreciated! :)

I know it's part of the tourist area, and I have seen the massage places scattered about that are obviously places catering to customers that want "special" services but the salon/haircut places seem different. Is it a gimmick? Something to draw clientele in? Get a haircut by a beautiful woman? Or is there a room in the back where someone's getting jerked off? Was trying to figure it out but I'm stumped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Americans always blamed northern Vietnam for invading southern Vietnam and that the United States simply came and supported southern Vietnam.
 They don't know why they lost that war. It is clear that Vietnam is a unified whole, there is no "southern Vietnam" and there is no "northern Vietnam". The Americans invaded Vietnam and the northern Vietnamese had the silent support of the people of South Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam was able to kick the American troops out of Vietnam.
 The Vietnamese people were in the old regime, injected with money by the US and spent it personally and without control. When the US withdrew, they lost funding, their living standards were reduced, so they were not used to it and tried to blame the communists. If the US wins, then Vietnam is now divided into two poles and will always be tense like "North Korea and South Korea" - obviously of the same origin but separated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do know Vietnamese but how i form my sentences are often incomprehensible, please bear with me here. 
 So for context, I'm a high school student living in Ha Noi. Thanks to my parents' connections, I've got a part-time job that fits my schedule perfectly, and the job pays quite well for a high school student (unfortunately they wouldn't hire outsiders). From that job I've saved up more than 100mil vnd. I dont know what to do with it. I'm definitely going to a college/university in the future, so should I set it aside to pay for my tuition fee? Or should I try to learn how to invest it? An online business, maybe? 
 What would you do if u were me,,,??? Oh and im gonna set aside like 30mil in case of emergencies.

I have been given given two choices for where to work: in District 12 on the west side of the airport or in the far east of District 2. I've been told District 12 is more likely to be where I will be working.
 With that in mind, where do you recommend I live? I want to have a fairly urban lifestyle with lots to do, see, eat, drink, and shop. Districts 1, 3, 4 and such look quite nice but are super far. I'm not sure what is in District 12 as it looks quite far, so I'm not sure if it has more comfortable apartments or not. Any advice would be welcome.
 Also, is it generally easy to change your working location after a few months?

 We’re a same sex couple planning a trip to VN in a few months. I’m intending on proposing to them at a semi private venue (there may be spectators around the area, but it’s nowhere public).
 I know there’s a growing positive sentiment towards LGBTQ rights in VN, but I’m not sure how friendly locals would be to seeing something like a marriage proposal. Will I be inviting negative reactions or reception? I just don’t want to create an awkward environment for us in doing this.

 I know this might be a long shot but this is probably the only place where someone can help me with this question.
 I'm currently working on a video of my trip in Vietnam last December and i would love to start the video with someone saying something in Vietnamese. I will be using only the audio so no need to film yourself or anything. Just a recording on your phone will be fine, if possible with as little background noise as possible, although i know that's difficult in Vietnam.
 The sentence i'd like to use is something like: "Hi! I would like to tell you about my Vietnam experience. Are you ready?" But of course translated to Vietnamese. 
 If anyone is willing to help me out, that'll be amazing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I will be moving to Vietnam next month and have just been informed that my home campus for the school I will work for is in Binh Long (near Aeon mall). 
 I don’t know much about this area, as when I lived in HCM before (not for long), I lived in Thao Dien and only really went to D1/D2/D3. Also most videos I watch are mainly based in these districts as well. 
 I want somewhere that’s not extremely touristy/‘expat-y’ (like Thao Dien and most of D1), but also has plenty of stuff to do and places to eat/drink, and not too far from touristy areas I can visit if I wanted (such as Nguyen hue). I originally planned to live in D3 as it seemed to fit these criteria.
 I realise BL isn’t actually that far from these areas, but I’m guessing with traffic and other factors, it would make the daily commute quite long and tedious. 
 I’d also want somewhere with decent accommodation options for around 8tr. 
 Thanks in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just received an ESL teaching offer from a well-known company in Vietnam. I would appreciate some advice on one of the terms in the contract, as follows:
 "In addition, by law, [company name] must be able to show at such an audit as referenced in the Decree No. 03/2014/ND-CP Article 8, full and complete details of all employees who are working at [company name] […] Only original documents (they will state 'This is notarised as an original' or similar) will be returned to you at the time of your leaving [company name]. Any notarised copies will be returned after not more than 3 months."
 So, I am planning to notarise and legalise copies of my degree and CELTA certificates, and give these to the company so they can process my work permit. I don't want to spoil my originals with stamps, and I'd be reluctant to hand over my originals in any case.
 I'm from the UK, and the process for notarising and legalising copies for use in Vietnam is very time-consuming and expensive. I'm unclear why the company would need to keep these officially notarised and legalised copies rather than a digital scan or physical copy of these, if it's just for audit purposes (a copy of a copy if you like). I'm concerned that it might be a ploy to stop me obtaining a separate work permit in the event that I wanted to work for another company (after the 3 month period stipulated).
 Is this standard practice, or should I be concerned? Any experience or advice would be much appreciated.

 Because it is a lot more unique, it's also a lot more expensive (3 or 4 times more expensive). It feels weird to bargain because it's a small handmade store, but it is quite expensive, more money then I would like to pay. Would it be fair to ask for a cheaper price? I wouldn't cut it as low as I would with more traditional street souvenir shops. I'm not sure if there is etiquette around where to try and negotiate prices. 
 Thanks in advance!

 What veggie do Vietnamese usually give their young child and how do you prepare it? We do have premade babies food from Avakids and Concung but we want to try some home-made solution. Any recipe would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm from the US, and I'm contemplating a vacation to Saigon D8. I am on a very strict /r/carnivore diet due to an autoimmune condition, and I mostly eat only beef, butter and eggs. Occasionally seafood. I eat around 1 lb of meat per day, sometimes a little more.
 ​
 How difficult will it be to maintain my strict diet while in Saigon? I usually cook at home, but will probably have to eat out while there.
 ​
 When I'm desperate in the US, I can even go to McDonalds and eat the meat patties without the bun or lettuce, sauce, etc. Is the meat at McDonald's comparable to the US meat patties in quantity & quality?
 ​
 Thanks for your input & advice.

 Is it easy to get food at night and in the early morning? Would it be more beneficial for me to sleep right after work or to sleep before work given a typical vietnamese day? Anything else I should keep in mind while there?

We booked to go this time of year as we thought it was the best compromise of temperature/ being dry. Getting excited I checked the weather forecast earlier today and was a bit disheartened to see that it looks rainier than I was expecting. 
 I would love to hear from anyone in any of those places at the moment what the weather's really like and if I should maybe re-think what I was planning and packing a few more waterproofs 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I'm a European, I work full remote and I'm in Japan now. It's pretty cold here so I'm planning a 10-12 days work holiday trip to Vietnam soon, end of February beginning of march probably, looking for some spring like weather.
 I've read a couple of posts where people tend to lean Hanoi rather than Ho Chi Minh as a tourist destination but I am not sure. I would be fine with either. I understand Hanoi si less vibrant, more traditional, which is ok. I'm not looking for nightlife as I will be working. I don't want to exclude Ho Chi Minh though.
 It would be my first visit to Vietnam and I'm pretty excited. My concern is the weather, as I read that Hanoi tends to be colder? I'm leaving Japan for that reason, so I don't want to find myself in the same situation.
 Also, I would like to work with my laptop around the city and enjoy the famous Vietnamese coffee culture. Is it safe? I'm used to Japan where pickpocketing is not a thing and I read some posts here pointing out that snatching phones is rather common. Is that true? I would be screwed without my computer. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The continued economic turmoil there got me wondering about this. If there was civil unrest that threatened the Laos government, what would happen if China sent troops in under the guise of supporting the government or protecting their investments.? Given Laos has be a defacto puppet of Vietnam for much of it's existence and and there's always been rumours of VN troops supporting the government even in recent times against the Hmong and in the past against Thailand, would there be a response? I think it's fair to say that Vietnam at least considers Laos a part of it's sphere of influence, and while China would presumably prefer to continue to buy influence as they're currently doing in Laos and Cambodia, civil unrest could change things. Not saying it's likely, just wondering what would the reaction of the VN government and people be?

I’ll be landing in Ho Chi Minh City and that will be my planned home base but I want to travel to several places in the two weeks that I have. I’m planning on a day trip to Cu Chi and am wondering what the recommendation would be for visiting the Mekong delta. I think I could spend two days there based on other places I want to see. Would you recommend I stay a couple nights there somewhere or should I plan on maybe two different day trip tours? I would greatly value your advice.

Would Vinfast pull out of the US market and would Vinfast likely crumble just like what happened to Vinsmart? Also, if Vinfast crumbles, what does it mean for Vingroup and Vietnam as a whole?

 Second, I import for personal use, and pay full duties (usually 10%). I could probably import as my company, but the paperwork is not worth the time for the fees saved, so I don't bother and just pay.
 Here's the general process:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are planning on coming to Vietnam next year on vacation. I just read that Vietnam dose not recognize the international drivers license I can get issued here in the US. 
 We were hoping to rent a motor scooter like we did in Thailand when we visited.
 How would I go about driving legally?
 If there is no way to get a legal driving permit for my trip how big of a trouble would I get in if I got pulled over while driving?
 In Thailand my international permit was valid, but I saw others get pulled over and asked to pay a 300bhat "fine" to be on their way.
 Please any advice is welcome, I really want to obey the law and do things right. But my wife and I like to explore and hike and get off the beaten path if you will and not being able to drive ourselves around could get costly and put a real damper on our trip.
 Thanks in advance for your time and help. Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is a bit of a long shot but here goes. So my girlfriend and a friend af hers are supposed to fly to Vietnam for a 2 week holiday but currently my girlfriend is stranded on Frankfurt airport because her express visa (or visum) application didn't get trough on time. She wasn't allowed on the flight because of this. My question to my fellow redditors is this: do you know of a way to try to get her application rushed trough. Or maybe someone knows someone that works at the governement departement that handles visa applications? Or maybe enter a second application? 
 It is a real longshot bu let's see if reddit can help.
 Eitherway i appreciatie anyone reading this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anybody done this recently? We always have used an agent for this but not this time as it's too expensive tbh. My new company will sponsor me the costs and paperworks, (1st time for me as I usually have to shoulder the cost in my previous company. I am not a teacher btw.). This is the first time they will hire a foreigner as well so there HR is also not so familiar. They will assist me as much as they can but brunt of the research will be from my end. I jusy need to know the process in General. They will sponsor me but as much as possible not going through an agent. 
 Ill be doing this first time and I am aware Vietnam always changes rules regarding this. Is this even doable by a foreigner (not married to a Vietnamese too) so language could pose a problem... Just want to get an idea if this is even possible.

 Since leaving Texas no one has cared for my hair like my sister, Shamonica Alexander, Trina Stoker and Andise Altine, two stylist I've been seeing for years.
 Last Sunday. I had my hair braided in Vietnam by a woman from the Congo who pretty much tried her damnest to pull all the hair out of my scalp into too tight cornrows. I had to take them down two days later. 
 Well, I don't do my own hair and without my trusted hair stylists to rescue the tangled mess. I had a temper tantrum and cut my hair off. I initially wanted to shave it but I only had scissors. 
 Today, I looked for a salon to make me look more presentable but literally had people just flat out deny me service. 
 It took three attempts and a couple of salons to get someone to shape my hair but finally got this kind man to agree to it at N'Black Barbershop in Phan Thiet, Vietnam
 He was gentle. He didn't tear through my hair but most of all I felt respected. I'm super grateful to him. 
 Haven't had much luck today getting someone to give me a manicure or pedicure. Will save that for another day.

 I’m a Canadian who travelled from Malaysia, now going to Ho Chi Minh, Da Nang, and lastly Hanoi.
 I’d consider myself very tattooed (both arms full, legs, and chest) from artists in Canada and some Malaysia. 
 I can’t find a definitive guideline for appropriate pricing for tattoos. Can anyone shed some light on standard hourly rates? 
 Thanks so much!

 I am currently travelling from New Zealand and accidentally left both my wallet and passport in the back of the seat in front of me on the train today.
 I caught the 15:30 train from Ga Sai Gon to Ga Binh Thuan yesterday before taking a grab further to our accommodation.
 I arrived at Ga Binh Thuan and got off the train in a rushed folly. Leaving my thungs.
 I have attempted to contact police tonight, called over 11 times, and was only received once. Before the phone was hungup.
 This is whatever, and I am sure to contact police on the phone or in person tomorrow.
 If anyone might know where my things might be/ who best to contact. 
 I will also try the train company but do not know the exact best course of action.

What I found were mostly toys or small plastic/wood low quality items that were painted in a rush, probably even made in China.
 What are some decent souvenirs that I can find in Hanoi? 
 Other than decorative stuff, what else I can buy, like any special spice or snack?

We declined because we could see there were other hotels with good offers on Booking.com.
 Now it's 2 hours later and we have visited 4, 4 star hotels in the old quarter who all had "Superior/deluxe/.." rooms listed as available at about 70-80% discounts on Booking and when we arrived to see the room they said that it is not available.
 We decided to book some Airbnb outside old quarter instead 😅.
 Is this normal practice in Old quarter/Hanoi/Vietnam or were we just very unlucky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm travelling to Vietnam soon, 2-3 days in HCMC, a few days on Phu Quoc island, a lot of time in Tan Chau.
 I'm very into tea and was hoping to find some tea shops that sell good quality loose leaf teas in HCMC and/or Tan Chau. As far as HCMC goes, I'll be in District 1 and District 3, with my tight schedule I won't be able to leave these areas in HCMC. 
 Any tips? I've found a few on google that look potentially promising (such as Trà Việt), but I wanted to know if there were better shops that I'm probably missing since I don't speak the language, or just some place that's a hidden gem. 
 Second, would tea be an appropriate gift for someone's family in Vietnam? We have other gifts we're bringing (Family member is getting married), but I thought I might add to it with a set of nicely presented teas as a thank you for hosting us.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, ChatGPT is becoming a hot topic in Vietnam because of how accessible it is to normal users and follow that trend is a booming scam market regarding to create a ChatGPT account. Because of that, I decided to make a post to guide you how to create your own legitimate ChatGPT account.
 Dạo gần đây, ChatGPT đã trở thành chủ đề nóng được quan tâm ở Việt Nam vì dịch vụ dễ dàng tiếp cận đối với người dùng bình thường, chính vì sự bùng nổ đó kéo theo vấn nạn lừa đảo liên quan đến việc tạo tài khoản ChatGPT. Chính vì thế mình quyết định viết bài post hướng dẫn tạo tài khoản ChatGPT chính gốc của bạn.
 ​
  
Because ChatGPT is not supported in Vietnam, you need a VPN to change your IP to another country. In case you don't have a VPN, vn-z forum provided a lot of vpn account for you to choose. Bởi vì ChatGPT không hỗ trợ ở Việt Nam, bạn sẽ cần VPN để chuyển địa chỉ IP của bạn sang nước khác. Trong trường hợp bạn không có VPN, diễn đàn vn-z có cung cấp tài khoản VPN cho các bạn thoải mái sử dụng.
 You need a foreign phone number for verification, I recommended smspool because it is reliable, cheap (depends on the country, most likely cost less than 1$) and I used it for my ChatGPT account myself. Các bạn cũng sẽ cần đến số điện thoại nước ngoài để xác minh danh tính, mình khuyến khích các bạn dùng smspool vì nó ổn định, rẻ (tuỳ đất nước bạn chọn, giá thành sẽ thấp hơn 20,000đ).
  
Good luck/Chúc may mắn
 Edit: ChatGPT is now supporting in Vietnam (11/2/2023), however you will need ChatGPT Plus for 20$. Depends on your need, my guide will be cheaper for you. Để tạo tài khoản ChatGPT ở Việt Nam tại thời điểm hiện tại, bạn cần đăng kí ChatGPT Plus với giá 20$ (470,000đ). Tuỳ nhu cầu sử dụng mỗi người, người dùng phổ thông không có 400,000đ dư giả để tiêu thì cách trên mình hướng dẫn rẻ hơn.

 In two weeks I will be accompanying my wife and our daughter on a short term business trip to Hanoi. Probably three months with short side trips to HCMC.
 What kind of weather can I expect?
 Is it jeans and hoodie or shorts and t-shirt?
 I've been to Vietnam a few times, but never in the north in winter/spring. So I usually pack t-shirts, shorts, light trekking pants and light trekking shirts.
 I'm a pretty big guy from the Netherlands and have no problems with cold, but heat gets to me quickly.
 Thanks a lot!

I was there today and saw the one sport route and the other bolts for setting up anchors. I did more research and saw that tours were operated by Phat Tire Adventures. I went to their website but could not find any information. I contacted them but have still not received a response. I would prefer to climb there without a guide, as I have all the stuff, but I wasn't sure if I was allowed. It seems strange that it is right in the middle of the main pathway. Can anyone lend any insight into this? Thanks!

I think it's an interesting and eye-opening watch, and I hope you all find it as educational as I did. Check it out and let me know what you think!

 I'm planning on relocating to Ho Chi Minh City in the near future, and am having trouble finding information online regarding the availability and costs of psychiatric help in the city. Right now I am on two psychiatric medications. While it appears it would not be too difficult to purchase these medications from pharmacies, I would like to have someone in the city who can monitor the effects of the medication, ideally on a monthly basis. 
 Are psychiatrists who have a good grasp of English hard to find in Vietnam? 
 How much would a visit generally cost? 
 Would going to a private hospital monthly to be evaluated be a feasible alternative? 
 I've read about issues with 'fake' versions of medications; is there a way to ensure I can avoid these? 
 Any additional insights would be greatly appreciated!

 Good idea? Anyone done this? By the look of travel vlogs it's what backpackers do in the north, in the mountains, but is is common in the city? 
 Pls share any experience with this. Thanks x

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 27 and finishing up a degree in the next 6 months to get my CELTA and hopefully teach in either Vietnam or Taiwan. This is something I've wanted since I was a teenager and I will be 28 by the time this becomes possible. My motivations beyond teaching English is to learn the language, however difficult Vietnamese may prove.
 I have been debating between Taiwan or Vietnam for years and have considered as many factors as possible, but one I would like some insight on is how difficult it may prove to form friendships with locals. I do not expect anyone to be enamored by foreigners and I am not looking for super deep friendships. I am not looking for a best friend and I am not looking for a significant other. I don't expect to be grabbing dinner or drinks constantly with locals. But I do want to be friends with locals and not solely rely on other expats.
 How realistic is this in Vietnam? I understand given my age where most people will be raising families and the language/cultural differences, that it will prove to be difficult. But once I get a working grasp of Vietnamese (however long and difficult that may be), could I expect to create some friendships with people besides other expats? From what I've read, this may be easier in Vietnam vs Taiwan, and I was looking for insight. I consider myself very friendly and I am always eager to make new friends, so normally this is not difficult for me but I have no previous experience to Vietnam nor living in a country where English is not the first language.

 I'll fly into Da Nang tomorrow from Malaysia. I'm a non-stop traveller, therefore I always bring all my belongings of which my drone is part of. I know that bringing a drone into the country is legal, however flying without permission is not and I reached out to so many officials in Vietnam and my local Vietnamese embassy to apply - without luck of course.
 By now, I couldn't care less about not being able to fly without a permit, but I'm worried about importing the thing via Da Nang, an airport that's notoriously famous for its customs officers' outdated mindset, with them confiscating drones. Obviously I want to avoid that and so I'm asking if anyone has made any recent experiences there and if it's still true that they only scan carry-on, but not checked bags?

 When I was in Vietnam, I was having fun but also stressed at the same time. There were too much people and traffic. As an introvert, I don’t like when it’s overcrowded. The weather was also too hot for my taste. I was also worried about getting pickpocketed, but luckily nothing happened.
 I told my mom several times that I wanted to go home. And I was so happy when it was finally time to travel back home. But now after returning, I suddenly feel depressed. I suddenly miss my relatives and all the adventures we did. I miss the food and culture also. 
 I told myself that this would be the third and final time I’m travelling to Vietnam, but now I’m itching to go back in the future. Does anyone else feel the same after their trip?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is not a critique of the country or the culture, just a curiosity question.
 I have a couple of female friends who over the past year who told me they are going to get married. 
 One of them told me that her parents are close with the parents of the the impending husband, and that her parents have wanted her to marry the guy for a while. 
 The other is being told by her parents she has to leave Vietnam and go and marry someone in Europe. Its a bit of a match making thing through friends of the family, even though she isn't that keen on going. 
 There was another very similar story I came across too this week via a friend's friend.
 Is this common? For the parents to essentially choose (or have an extremely strong preference) for who the girl should marry? I always thought this was more an Indian/South Asian thing.

MB bank no longer allows foreigners to hold or use a debt card. VIB allows existing foreigner customers to have an ATM card but cannot use that card for purchases in shops or businesses. 
 Is this a change in policy with all banks or only these two?

 It was one of if not the greatest month of my life even if by week three it felt like I was being chased by COVID.
 A lot of sites we had planned to visit didn't happen since most places shut down. At the time we had no idea of the future and really thought we would just visit the following year. Not knowing the world would be shut down. 
 It's almost three years later and has life really changed. I'm a home owner now, have a daughter who is 14 months and a son on the way. 
 Life has become very adulty. 😂 
 Traveling with my wife will never be the same but we always talk about our time in Vietnam.
 It's beautiful, the country is appasulty beautiful! The people are appasulty beautiful! We made such great friends on our trip even with the language barrier. Friends who we still keep in touch with till this day. 
 I know we'll be back one day most likely when we're old. Going to have to skip out on the sleep buses and over night train rides at the point. 😆
 I hope we can visit much sooner than later with or without the kids. I would love to bring my children with me, I want them to be as well traveled as myself.
 I really just wanted to let everyone know how much I miss and love Vietnam and hope to see everyone sooner than later. 
 Ps. I still have yet to find Cao Lau in the states.

1h flight direct / 3h with layover.
 But I’ve heard there is almost always delays with domestic flights here especially with budget airlines. 
 
11h bus ride. Already done 8 hour Saigon to Da Lat & doing 4 hour Da Lat to Nha Trang tomorrow. 
 
11h train. Not heard much. 
 
 What’s the locals option on doing this? What would be my best option we are with a group of 6. Money isn’t the biggest concern but should be considered. Time definitely more valuable as we are moving place to place every 3 days roughly.

 I have recently been offered a management job to join a company in Vietnam. The salary they are offering would be 85 million đồng per month plus minor stock options in the business. 
 I current live in the UK (but not in London) and earn around 15% more than this but I believe even living in HCMC, my living expenses in Vietnam would be much less than what I have now.
 Obviously I know that the average person in Vietnam is not earning 85 million / month, but will this be enough for a foreigner to rent a city centre apartment, get a motorbike (or even car?) and live comfortably?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào các bạn!
 So after being very confused why my Vietnamese friend was saying words that end in “oc” as “op,” I decided to do some research. Apparently, in Vietnamese, you have to close your mouth for certain ending constants, so a word ending in ung would sound like “ungm.”
 My question to you guys is how say it. I remember teaching my friends how to properly pronounce the Spanish “t” by placing the tips of their tongues on the top part of the back of their teeth. I realize this question is kind of technical, but everything I’ve looked up doesn’t really address it or attributes it to an different accent or dialect (but both Northerners and Southerners do this from my knowledge).
 Any advice? Many thanks! Cảm ơn!
 I also tagged this as discussion since I can’t seem to get a clear answer on how to do this lingual maneuver.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào các bạn,
 My fiance and I (US) are getting married this year and are doing a reception in the U.S. and in Viet Nam with my side of the family who are in Viet Nam. It will be a small affair, of about 25-30 people max, total. Does anyone know of any venues in Saigon that could host this, and/or estimates as to how much an event like this my cost? I read some anecdotes of a low key reception of 50 people costing $1k that included food, MC, music. 
 Honestly any information or experience or advice you would have would be so helpful and much appreciated. I don't even know where to start looking, lol. Cảm ơn nhiều!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having lived here for going on four years I'm constantly amazed that I do not see a vehicular collision every day, given the chaos and rule breaking observed on the roads.
 That said last week an old geezer rear ended my PCX on his 25 year old Wave, or whatever it was.
 Pretty sure he'd been at the Bia Hoi, and 99% sure his vision wasn't 20/20. Add in that it happened at night.
 It's said that Thailand is the second most dangerous country in the world re. traffic accidents and fatalities.
 Where does Vietnam fit into the picture re. the aforementioned?
 I drive really slowly, be it in the city or on the bigger roads. Seems that's the key. A colleague said to me he treats everyone as a drunk driver looking at their phone.
 Then you have the buffalo boys who hoon around town, helmetless. Surely these guys don't last long?
 Interested in what you've seen/been involved in/heard re. the madness that is Vietnamese traffic.
 *Note: not shitting on Vietnam, just want some feedback. For me, traffic and dodgy bosses are the least pleasant aspect of living here. They are balanced out, or outweighed by the positives.

My other phone is now working just fine (of course) and I no longer need the new phone. I have been told that because it was activated that I cannot return it. It also has a local SIM card and it that has just about two gigs of data left. Would anybody be interested in buying this phone from me?

 I'm looking to see if there are laid back, cheap beer, cheap simple mixed drinks, beach bars, not clubs, I don't want DJs or raves or anything like that and are they in close proximity to the main resorts?
 I love sitting feet in the sand having a local beer with good conversation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[me and my husband was having lunch and enjoying our time. Then suddenly a vietnamese older guy walked into the restaurant and just come up to us and started talking. I could not make out what he was saying. he mumbled a lot to the point I wasn't sure if he was even vietnamese. I am vietnamese so i would be able to understand if he wanted something from us. But he especially looked at my husband and told me something. Then he sat down next to us on the other table and kept on talking to us. Finally I can hear what he was saying and he kept mumbling how my husband has to learn vietnamese to communicate. He had this painful, almost angry expression on his face. He seems offended my husband doesn't speak vietnamese somehow. 
 The staff finally came over and asked him to leave. She was alone so she didn't know how to handle the situation. I asked her about him and she said he seems drunk and not from around the neighborhood. 
 Does this happened to any of you? didn't know how to react, was uncomfortable during and after it. he stayed for at least 10mins just talk and talk and talk... so very weird

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi:
 I'm seeing a lady that mentioned she loves Vietnamese Fish Sauce. We're both Americans living in Northern California. 
 I'd like to surprise her. Some (I'm sorry, very, very basic) questions.
 - Is there a good fish sauce flavored snack like chips or crackers I could find for her? I'm in Northern California and there are Vietnamese (or at least large Asian) supermarkets. 
 - If I bought her a bottle of fish sauce for her kitchen is there anything likely to be in an American kitchen she could pair it with? Any brands you'd suggest? Is fish sauce something you pretty much need to make yourself?
 - If I stop by a local Vietnamese restaurant, what could I order (and it wouldn't surprise if the answer is 'anything') that would have a lot of fish sauce? Spring rolls?
 ​
 Any help is appreciated!!!
 cảm ơn (looked it up!)

 So I'm planning a trip to SE Asia in a few months, and was wondering what the situation is like for public restrooms in Vietnam? It's been over 20ish years since I last came to VN and I don't remember what it was like then (was visiting friends and their families, and we were mostly in rural areas).
 Now that I'm older and a little more sensitive in terms of food, I'm concerned with eating something that won't sit well and I'll need to run to the bathroom or something.
 I'm already planning to pack things like napkins, antibiotics, anti-diarrheals, and other stomach whatever medicine, but just wanted to hear from others what to expect!
 For reference, going to Saigon and Ha Noi for this trip. They're big tourist cities, so I'm assuming it shouldn't be a big issue but I understand I shouldn't assume.

Ironically the label says "Made in Vietnam" but I had never seen anything like this before and all my attempts to look for one here haven't been successful yet. What I want to look for:
  
Same material. After wearing these I can't go back to jeans anymore!
 
The zip convertible is convenient in rainy season.
 
The attached belt and lots of pockets.
 
I'm a bit big (bellied 😣) for Vietnamese, usually I wear Vietnamese 3XL or Canadian M-L. It's a bit difficult to find big sizes here.
 
 I can buy in HCMC or order online. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other night my partner and I were having dinner on P. Mã Mây in Hanoi when two local dudes starting attacking another local dude. Large machetes, axes, and sword like instruments were produced. The parties started swinging them at each other. We were a bit taken back because of the time, only 07:00pm, and it was in a semi busy tourist area. It was literally across from a very popular tattoo place. 
 My partner and I got out of there pretty quick smart, but we’re pretty surprised/shocked that this kind of thing happened in a popular street. While both of us have witnessed this kind of violence in our home country (aus), we just weren’t sure what the normal thing to do in Hanoi would be? In Australia, the incident would have incited loads of media and police attention/investigation.
 We kinda just played the ‘eyes shut’ game and didn’t tell anyone about it.
 Should we have reported the incident to local police? Is this a normal thing to happen in Hanoi and is it just underreported to tourists?

 I was born and raised in America. Both of my parents are Việt Kiều, and gave me the opportunity to study and practice the language, so I am fluent but by no means a professional. I just came back from Vietnam, and a lot of locals told me that my Vietnamese is correct, but that they know I am a foreigner because my way of speaking sounds "lớ lớ." Their English is limited, so I couldn't understand when they tried to explain what the phrase means. Any help appreciated, cảm ơn!

 - Cleanliness; The CBD/City centre is insanely clean? I saw almost no rubbish at at all, and the rate of construction and urban development has blown me away. I'm unsure if its just buildings for show but it looks great. Some outer suburbs reminded me of other parts of Asia i've been in but that is correlated to a lower socio-economic situation obviously.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am quite worried. Please help.
 I’m a dual-citizen: Armenian and American. I arrived into Laos today from Thailand with my Armenian passport and I had a visa for it. The border patrol rejected my entry because they wanted me to get into Laos using my American passport given that I got Thai entry/exit stamps in that passport. So I had to reapply with a visa on arrival using my American passport. This caught me by surprise because I’ve switched my passport several times while visiting countries and it has never been a problem.
 AND I’m going to Vietnam in 2 days and I have a visa approval for Vietnam under my Armenian passport again. A worker at Laos’ immigration said it’s fine if I enter Vietnam and that the rules are different but I want to be sure. Vietnamese consulates in Laos are closed for the weekend and I can’t get help from anyone. Does anyone have more information about this? Does Vietnam allow passport swapping?
 Note: there’s no visa on arrival for Armenians or Americans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'll be moving there for work and have tried searching for more info but haven't had much luck besides the basics.
 - What is rent like (cheap or affordable)?
 - Is it local or a mix with foreigners?
 - What's the commute like to D1 or D2?
 - Is there a nightlife?
 - Are there many gyms? I wanted to look into learning mixed martial arts...any options there?
 - Is it busy (traffic/noise etc.)
 Overall, what should I expect? Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: thanks for answering my questions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first came here, I loved it and openly spoke on TV and media about how great it is here. The people were great, everyone had a huge "togetherness" spirit when COVID started.. Now.... I absolutely hate it. Everyone, every day, is trying to screw each other over. Old people are vile and rude as fuck, acting like a bunch of gorillas. Everyone has an agenda. Companies are dishonest. People try to kill you on the road and act cowardly when confronted. When I came here, I was on TV talking about how great Vietnam is, but I've never in my life been tricked, lied to or screwed over as much as here. I am deeply depressed and miserable. HOWEVER, I am trying to reconnect with the reasons why I loved this place. One last ditch effort to regain happiness here.. maybe some of you can help me re-ignite that spark again. What is it that you like about living here? EDIT: I've been here 3 years

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not think the news was already posted here, but the Michelin Guide is coming in Vietnam. First edition of the guide will be released in June.
 I think it’s a great think for Vietnam – It will help a lot the restaurants aiming to offer fine dining especially Vietnamese ones.
 What are your prognostics about the potential decorated restaurant in Vietnam?
 My opinion:
 - No 3 Stars Restaurants. I really do not think any venue in Vietnam is there yet. Bangkok does not have any 3 Stars Restaurants.
 - Anan Saigon: I really see them decorated. I tried them few years ago it was great, but it seems what they offer now is more elaborated. It’s the only restaurant in Vietnam that made to Asia’s Top 50 + their food relates a lot to Vietnam
 - I also think that the Guide will give one Star to a good Street food stall / place either in Ha Noi or HCMC. The guide did that both in Thailand (Jay bee) and Singapore. It’s a way for them to not appear too snobbish and it’s good PR…
 - Maybe one or two high end French Restaurants from Ho Chi Minh City: I have tried 3 Gourmands / La Villa / P’tit Saigon / Le Corto. All of them are great but I guess inspectors of the guide have been eating a lot in “similar” restaurants. I am just not sure if they will be "good enough" to get one Stars with French Cuisine. I could also add La Badiane in Ha Noi to this list.
 - One or more Japanese Restaurant? Likely – There is so many great Japanese Restaurant both in Hanoi et HCMC. I have just not tried enough of them to have an any name in mind.
 For the locals not familiar with how the Guide works ( I have seen many mistakes both on Facebook and local news sites) we wrote this article: https://amthuchiendai.vn/tat-ca-nhung-gi-can-biet-ve-cam-nang-michelin/

 Is it recommended to stay in Cat Ba for a few nights? or Ha Long? or Hanoi? I plan to do a 2 night cruise starting my second day, so ill have 2 nights to burn. I'm looking to do some exploring but mostly want to relax. Ill most likely be flying out of Hanoi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I would like to ask anyone who has any knowledge on the topic I wrote about in my title.
 To put it simply, I am currently filing taxes for 2022 and it asks for my marital status in which I understand that I should put Married but am unsure which type of Married filing I should put, whether separately, jointly or head of household.
 I am also working on papers to bring my wife to the US, so I don't know if picking one of these choices is more beneficial than the other. Although, I do know that filing jointly is much more difficult and may take time to obtain certain papers.
 She does not have an income if that matters.

 A local internet service provider reported Monday that the Intra Asia (IA) cable has been encountering problems since last Saturday. There was a breakage at a cable section located about 130 km from a shoreline station in Singapore, causing a total loss of international data from Vietnam to Singapore through the IA cable.
 The latest breakage means that only one undersea cable connecting Vietnam globally, the SMW3, remains fully functional.
 Vietnam is currently connected with seven undersea cables: SMW3, AAG, IA, APG, AAE-1, SJC2 and ADC. Besides the recent breakage of the IA, problems with the AAE, AAG and APG cables tha…]]></summary>

 Or should I be less lazy and just create my own learning cards/prompts and study the language that way?

I have no problem teaching. However, my passion is in public policy (of which I am getting a degree for it now). Unfortunately when I look for job opportunities for expats working in the government I can’t see anything. Does anyone know anything more about this? 
 Btw, I am planning to move when I finish my degree in the next few years or so.
 Edit: not looking to be an elected representative or anything. More like administrative work ie: assisting with permits/ regulations.

  People drink at a Highlands Coffee shop in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Y'all can check out more number here: Many Vietnamese spend more on drinks than main meals: report - VnExpress International 
 Another 33% of respondents are willing to spend VND20,000-40,000 on drinks, according to the survey of 3,940 consumers conducted by food and beverage market solutions firm iPOS.
 Only 14% said they would splurge more than VND70,000 for a drink, the equivalent of the price of a drink at high-end coffee shops such as Starbucks and Runam Bistro, it added.
 Nearly 54% of respondents said they visit coffee shops once to twice a month.
 I believe that the avg. hour rate in Vietnam is less than 25,000 VNĐ. How could they spend over 3 hours of working daily for a coffee?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wondering which is the best lounge in Ho Chi Minh international airport with showers at the moment? Also, if you have a long layover (14 ish hours) can you leave the airport? And do you need a visa? Will my luggage be checked through to my final destination? From what I have read it can be a bit hit-and-miss. Thank you!

I am planning on heading to Vietnam in the second half of August and am desperate to travel on the Ha Giang Loop but not on a motorbike and also not someone else taking me. I am a very capable cyclist but I was basically wondering if it was possible and safe? I would be happy to make it a large proportion of the trip so if there would be any safer potentially longer routes/roads? And where would be a good place to hire or purchase a good quality bike ( may be cheaper just buying) but would rather hire? I understand this is not the usual way to do the loop but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much

Lived in Thailand for seven years so hanging out on backpacker walking streets the majority of my nights there isnt something I wanna do, I'll go and check it out for a bit but I'm getting a tad bit old for all night drinking sessions with pounding music but I'm also not looking for HiSo speakeasy places where I have to get dressed up lol Oddly specific question I know, was just wondering if there are areas like that, small beer bars with a pool table and the like. Dont really care if there are ladies or not, that's not my objective but if there are it wont bother me either and faux british pubs aren't really my thing either lol. Thanks for any suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào các bạn!
 I'm Vietnamese-American (28F) and have visited my family in Việt Nam several times. But, the last time I visited was in 2016. My husband and I are planning a long vacation in Việt Nam late summer this year and I was wondering what street fashion for young adults in their 20s is like now, for both men and women. My husband is white so he's going to stand out no matter what, so I'm not worried about looking like I am a "local", but am really just interested in how street fashion has changed since I last visited and what is commonplace now. 
 In college, I met an exchange student from Việt Nam and when he saw me wearing short running shorts, he was appalled and asked why I was wearing those. I was confused why he was so shocked and he said in Việt Nam, only prostitutes wear shorts that short (they were like...mid-thigh length). This was back in 2014, though... I have no idea how accurate that reaction was to what's commonplace though because I've never been there long enough to really notice or outside of my family's district to see much else. 
 Cảm ơn nhiều!

 Hello! 
 Back in December, my airpods were stolen in Da Nang. Since I was flying out the same day, I couldn't do much and went my way. 
 Today, I got a ping on Find My app with the exact address. They are in Phuoc Ninh, Hai Châu, Da Nang. 
 What are my options to recover them? Would the police take this seriously? 
 They were my first gift to my would be fiance, so the emotional value matters a lot more than the financial value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. 
 Last year I went to Thailand and the subreddit r/Thailandtourism helped me a lot because I could look I could look up a lot of stuff and ask questions. It seems like there is no equivalent subreddit for traveling Vietnam, is there a site which a lot of people use that I just don't know of? Or is traveling through Vietnam that much rarer and information is not sought after?
 It feels like I just don't know a very obvious site/forum...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Need help choosing which Ha Giang Loop tour to take!
 Planning to do a 3/4 day Ha Giang Loop tour with an easy rider (can’t ride a motorbike, and honestly some parts of the route looks hella dangerous for someone w no experience). Saw lots of different tour groups, and most of them (Jasmine Hostel, Ha Giang Road Trip, QTmotors) seem to have pretty good reviews, making it kind of hard to choose between them. Could someone recommend me a suitable one based on these criteria?
 (1) Can arrange for transport back and forth from Hanoi (2) Experienced, heavy focus on safety (3) Really just a personal preference, but would prefer one with less of a ‘party’ vibe. Saw lots of videos with HUGE groups that are kind of loud and wild at night, and honestly I’d just like one with more of a chill vibe/ a smaller group (4) I don’t mind spending more, but lower prices would be great!
 Also, is there a big difference in the weather in end April and middle of May? 
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: I’ll be doing this in End April/May :) do PM me if you’re planning to go there too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of people have told me to avoid ice in my drinks as it’s unfiltered tap water? As well as seafood and salads etc. I’m wondering with all these conditions per se it feels like I’m walking thin ice just to enjoy my holiday; although I imagine something like typhoid or salmonella would be much worse etc etc. How do the locals avoid this? How do you know what’s safe to eat etc considering there is so many of you. Or is it much less of a worry then made out too be?

But it would not accept my US-based virtual phone number and would not accept my VN number either. Dead end. Any ideas?

 I might come back to the central region just to see more of hue. 
 Anyone likes hue too? Especially on a scooter, its really enjoyable that way
 No one talks about the nearby rolling hills near the tombs. They are amazing.
