 I am interested in moving to Vietnam and working for a year. I have quite sensitive health problems, blepharitis and quite serious eczema; right now I have them both fairly under control but am quite concerned that the pollution will cause it to flair.
 Ideally, I want to move to Hanoi, but am also considering Saigon as I heard it's better air .I fear the air might affect my health problems. I would happily buy an air filter, mask, and try my best to avoid rush hour.
 Am I worrying too much? Is a year short enough to be relatively safe?
 What are your experiences, thank you!

To top it off, it could cost me my job.
 I got a US FBI background check before coming, but unfortunately was informed on my second day in the country that it is invalid for Vietnam and I need to get a local check. I was informed there are two ways to go about this - apply for a residence certificate from the police and apply for the criminal check in person with that residence certificate, or do it all online via a private agency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I (21M) was born in 2001 in HCMC Vietnam and my mother's side originated from the HCMC region whilst my father's side originated from the North (he was born in Hanoi by the way). Even though both my parents, both my sisters (33F, 21F), and I have visited Hanoi several times, most of my mother's side has never visited North Vietnam yet (north of 17th parallel), despite the fact most of her relatives still live in Vietnam (from what I have heard from my mother, her side is quite wealthy and many of her relatives are business owners). Many of them only went around the Southern third of Vietnam and the furthest North many of them has visited is Nha Trang/Dalat. In fact, for all of my mother's relatives in the US (most came during the mid-late 1990s), none of them went above Nha Trang and half of them only visited Vietnam once or twice afterwards.
 Despite the fact I have only lived in Vietnam for 5 years before moving to Russia to study in 2006 and subsequently moving to the US at 11 in 2012, I have visited Vietnam several times afterwards (my most recent trip was in 2019 by the way), and I have visited the following places:
 Ca Mau, Can Tho, Long Xuyen, Ben Tre, Vung Tau, HCMC, Tay Ninh, Phan Thiet, Dalat, Nha Trang, Buon Ma Thuot, Tuy Hoa, Quy Nhon, Pleiku, Quang Ngai, Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Vinh, Thanh Hoa, Nam Dinh, Hanoi, Hai Duong, Haiphong, Ha Long, Thai Nguyen, Sapa
 ​
  
I am curious if it is common for Vietnamese people to have never visited the Northern half (North of 16/17 parallel)
 Plus, how common is it for Vietnamese Americans to never return to Vietnam or only return there once since moving to the US

 I want to buy train tickets (e.g. Ha Noi to Hai Duong) and someone told me that I should buy them in a bank mobile app. Do all banks have this feature?
 Last question, when Vietnamese people go to the shops and they "chuyển khoản", do they mean paying with a card or is that some other way of paying that I don't know?

 Are there 5 star cruises there that take a less crowded route?
 We don't care so much about spending the night on the boat but seems like that is the standard way to enjoy it.
 I hear there are other bays nearby but that they are not any less crowded.
 Tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào!
 I am visiting Hanoi from now until friday, the 31st of april, and I am interested in getting a custom tailored mens suit! I just want a jacket and pants, but if the price is good I could be convinced to get a shirt and/or vest too. I am thinking of choosing a charcoal wool/wool blend material.
 I am in my mid-20s but want it to be a versatile suit, so nothing either super vintage nor super modern; Regular length and medium-width notched lapels for the jacket and a slim-straight cut for the pants would be ideal. I also would like the suit to have some stretch, as I often get uncomfortable with the restrictive/stiff feel of store-bought suits.
 My budget would ideally be 5million VND, but a lot of talk online about this stuff is from pre-covid times, so I don't know if that is a realistic number. Please correct my expectations if they are unrealistic.
 What tailors would be appropriate for what I am looking for, and what prices can I expect? Also: do I need to buy the fabric separately on my own, or will that be included in the tailor bill? Or would it be cheaper to buy on my own? 
 Any and all advice is much appreciated! Cảm ơn : )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I’m taking a trip to Vietnam soon and trying to workout my itinerary and would love some advice!
 So on the 4th of May, the plan is to take the night train from Dong Hoi up to Tam Coc. I’ve realised maybe 1 day is not enough for Tam Coc. Plus it’s a long journey from Tam Coc up to Ha Giang…
 After Tam Coc, the plan was to do the Ha Giang loop, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, however if we stay the extra day in Tam Coc, plus the long journey, I’m not sure we will have 4 days to do the loop. 
 We have to be in Hai Phong Bay at 11:30am on Monday 10th for a trip to Cat Ba.
 So here is my question:
 Should we skip Tam Coc all together, get up to Ha Giang and just do the loop for as long as we can? Should we do the 2 days in Tam Coc and just do a smaller loop of Ha Giang? Should I stick to 1 day in Tam Coc and the 4 day loop of Ha Giang?
 It looks like if we decide to go to Tam Coc, we will have to get a night bus up to Ha Giang. And of course then another night bus from Ha Giang down to Hanoi. Lot of night travel - is it too much? Should we ease up and save stuff for another visit?
 Thanks for your help!

I'm 21F, Indian, and have a BA degree in History and am currently in my last year of law school. I have been seriously contemplating the idea of enrolling in a CELTA course and English as a foreign language full time, but this particular trip is going to have to be limited to 1 month. 
 I am looking at volunteering to to teach English or working with children in any capacity. I understand that my lack of certification and the duration of the trip is going to be an issue but I would be happy to be involved in any sort of volunteer work. I have previously worked as a college counselor for underprivileged children and been a paid tutor at an IELTS center in my city. 
 I have managed to find a few workaway opportunities that help you assist English language teachers and work on curriculum development but I'm not sure how legit they are. Please help connect me to any volunteer opportunities in the month of June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I have been riding motorbikes and scooters in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia without issues. Just arrived in Vietnam, rented a scooter in Mui Ne and within the first 15 minuntes I was taken to the police station. Tried to haggle the fine but in the end I left with 500k less in my pocket. 
 Given that I am not going to be able to produce a valid licence since Im already here and my IDP has only a B stamp: Are there any tricks to avoid being stopped or prevent the fine at all? I'm going to be renting bikes in Dalat, Da Nang, Nihn Binh and Ha Giang, so would rather not pay 500k each time.
 If not able to avoid police encounters, what would the minimum reasonable "fine" that I could settle for?

 Most of the other discussion I see mention resorts for beaches but are the public beaches here good? My wife suffers a bit from too much sun so we wouldn’t mind having umbrellas and facilities at the beaches! 
 We will also spend a couple of days towards the south west of the island if anyone jas recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Vietnamese! I spent a wonderful 10 day trip in Hanoi a month ago. I loved it and I want to be back for another remote working period, maybe in Da Nang. My only concern is the internet speed, as my job relies heavily on Zoom meetings. Last time the connection was bumpy, I had some serious issues one day and I am concerned. I read the news and know about internet cables, but I prefer first hand information. So here I am, any feedback will be much appreciated. Thanks a lot!

 Is there a way I can rent a motor bike in Hội An or Da Nang and return somewhere in Hue? I won’t have the time to return it back to the original place. 
 Otherwise, would you recommend an alternative mode of transportation (like a bus) where I’d be able to stop and check out the view? 
 For additional context - I’m a budget travel so kinda looking for an affordable way to travel. Also, I’m an exercised driver in Canada but motorbikes are new for me so I’m not sure if this is a beginner friendly route.

 So I'm going to Ha Long Bay with my university and as part of one of the classes were doing a project (mini doc) about community perception of UNESCO world heritage sites and was wondering if anyone knew what the laws around filming in that area are. I wasn't able to find much information other than for large film crews and as this is a school project where I and another classmate would be interviewing 2-3 locals I don't believe we fall into that category. The setup would be minimal with a tripod, camera, mic, and potentially a very small light if needed. Any help or pointers would be appreciated!

 We asked around and looked online but there seems to be no sign of fresh keg beer. Don’t worry, we were able to hydrate with a few tasty green Saigon’s but today our pilgrimage continues. 
 Can anyone help? Does Bia Hoi still exist?

 However, the comment section was flooded with people saying "Vietnamese people are so money-focused, materialistic, etc etc", in a quite derisive way. And not just in that post either, I've seen such comments on multiple occasions, and they pretty much annoyed me.
 Yes, I admit, a lot of Vietnamese people are materialistic. But do you know why they are that way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! 
 My girlfriend and I will be setting off on a 7 week trip in 2 weeks to South east Asia, including 3 weeks in Vietnam! Around week 5, we are hoping to take a 5 day trip round the Ha giang loop, and I wanted to discuss the logistics of this here. A few notes:
  
neither of us have ridden a motorcycle/moped before, but are confident car drivers. We have access to a 100cc motorbike for practice
 both of our UK drivers licences cover "AM" vehicles (motorbikes smaller than 50cc) but to ride up to 175cc, we need an A1 licence
 we plan to rent motorbikes in the islands of Thailand earlier in our trip, and gauge whether we think it is feasible to carry out 5 days of driving.
 We will be doing the Ha Giang Loop in early May
  
I guess my biggest question is what are our options?
 Should we try to get an A1 licence before we go? (It only takes a day AFAIK so we should be able to sort it before the trip) if we bother doing this, will we be able to get an IDP that works? I've heard conflicting reports regarding the state of IDPs
 Should we go as we are? In this case we'll need to pay off police I'm sure which isn't a huge deal but I'd be worried about getting our bikes impounded, especially half way through the loop
 Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!

We initially thought we would do the five lakes trail, but since our daughter is only nine and, to be frank, rather short for her age, we don't feel comfortable with the climbing part, as we are not sure she will be able to reach for the ropes. There are, supposedly, two trails to reach five lakes - do you also have to climb when you take the easier one (that is, not the adventure trail)? And has anyone done the peasant trail? I have not been able to find any information on this trail, except that it ends in a water fall and has the best likelyhood to see birds (which would actually be super nice). Does this trail involve any climbing, too?

I create cinematic content for businesses to use on their social media platform. I have 6 years of experience in social media content curation. My passion for filmmaking has taken me to many places. I have been traveling and volunteering around India, which has been a fulfilling experience. 
 Where I grew up very connected to the sea, I grew up on the island life fixing boats, painting them and a lot of community works as apart of the local lifestyle there, as someone who loves nature and sustainability, I'm excited to travel outside of my country for the first time to put my skills to work for a meaningful cause. I'm passionate about balancing sports like slacklining, skateboarding, and surfing. I've spent a good amount of time sharing and teaching these skills. I'm also a documentary filmmaker and love to capture the beauty of nature and the stories of people who live in harmony with the environment.
 Few volunteering opportunities I did : - Helped a farmer for 3 months on his produce somewhere in the lush hills of western ghats in India. - Volunteered for an eco-festival in India to teach skating and help the festival crew. - Volunteered in the himalayas to help build a home-stay with a sustainable lifestyle. - Helped a few homestays and small businesses to provide quality content for their social media.
 Let's work together to make a positive impact while exploring a new culture!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by a comment thread in a recent post, I started to curiously think about the ideological/political alignment of Vietnamese people (or, at least the users of this subreddit): how do you perceive yourself ideologically, disregarding one's support for the government - or lack thereof - as a political position itself?
 Do you appreciate traditional family values, free trade, private property rights, low taxation, strong military, social hierarchies, minimum social spending; are you into trade unions, social egalitarianism, progressive taxation, governmental support programs, free health care and education, gender equality? 
 Do you get thrilled by socializing the means of production, class consciousness, centralized planning, international proletarian revolution and anti-imperialism; or are you proudly "anti-woke", support the interests of Vietnamese people over everything else, think that LGBTQ+ people should just go back to the closet and believe that climate change is a globalist hoax?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, everyone!
 I am docked at the cargo terminal just outside Ho Chi Minh for the next few days, and I'd like to get to see some of the city, despite my hellish work schedule. For that, I have some questions:
  
Will I be finding much open outside after 11pm?
 Is it realistic to try to use Grab to have someone pick me up? The app as of now gives me an estimate of 19-20min for someone to even show up, and I know the drive to Ho Chi Minh is like 45min-1h.
 Does anyone know a taxi driver who I can contact to perhaps strike a deal to bring crew members in and out for the next couple of days?
  
My company organizes a shuttle bus but it runs only until 8-9pm and I usually leave work at 10pm. I only have USD, and cards. No local currency at the moment. As per Vietnamese authorities, I am also not authorized to wander about anywhere other than Ho Chi Minh, and just a night pass cost me 10 USD, otherwise I'd have 10pm curfew.
 Please help!

 Background info: I ordered a package from the UK, it arrived into VNSGNA but got no updates for 4 working days. So I contacted VNpost and this is their response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Vietnamese-American, and I feel as though I haven't developed a really positive relationship with being Viet. But, I would like to relate better to my background.
 For me, I associate the Vietnamese language and Vietnamese life with a lot of negativity. I think of Vietnamese people that are just really focused on money, friends who have issues with their parents, adults that are constantly yelling with each other, and people who just take out their insecurities on others because they want respect or validation,
 I haven't been able to have a lot of positive interactions and associations when it comes to being Viet. Viet life is just viewed as a source of turmoil to me sometimes.
 If you also feel this way about being Viet, please comment your emotions below.
 I know some people who have a good and healthy relationship to being Viet, but I'd consider them to be few. I'd really like to have a better relationship to being Viet, because I feel like a lot of us hate ourselves. Historically, it looks like a lot of us have just wanted to attach ourselves to other larger empires, such as China, France, or America. And, that makes me kinda sad. 
 The few people that I know that have a positive relationship to being Vietnamese come from good, healthy families. But, our community has a lot of trauma, and, to me, that makes those good families become uncommon.

I joined this sub to be able to live vicariously through everyone else traveling while I am not in VN and what I’ve experienced so far is a bunch of nasty people giving travelers shit for not giving every single detail about any given trip or cultural question. If I hadn’t already been to Vietnam and found out that the people there are, by and large, much more friendly and welcoming, this sub would 100% put me off from traveling there.
 (Of course, judging by some of the comments I’ve seen, a lot of you isolationists would be fine with it.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are traveling through Vietnam in April and will be on Phu Quoc for a few days towards the end of our trip. To compensate our daughter a bit for all the walking and looking at things, we had considered visiting the Aquatopia water park. As we know by now, the free shuttle bus has been discontinued, but we found out that the public bus #11 (which also runs from the airport) goes close enough to the cable car station. Only unfortunately it seems that the bus is also no longer running, at least I can't find any information about it on the net (not even on the airport page). Has anyone ridden the bus lately or knows that it no longer exists? If it runs, we would look for a hotel along the bus line, otherwise we go, as actually planned, to Ong Lang and forget the thing with the park simply (I have no desire to pay 60€ for cabs to Cable Station and back, then we rather invest the money in as much ice cream as she can eat...). Or are there any other public busses, preferably from/to the Ong Lang area?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been on a culinary journey lately, exploring the delicious world of Vietnamese breakfasts. We all know and love Pho and Banh Mi, but there's so much more to the Vietnamese breakfast scene that often goes unnoticed. Recently, I've discovered a lesser-known but absolutely mouthwatering dish: Banh Cuon Cao Bang! 😋
 For those who haven't tried it yet, Banh Cuon Cao Bang is a delicate and savory rice noodle roll filled with minced pork, wood ear mushrooms, and shallots. It's usually served with a side of fresh herbs, cucumber, and a tasty dipping sauce. It has quickly become my go-to breakfast choice, and I'm eager to find more dishes like this!
 So, fellow foodies, I'm asking you: What are your favorite Vietnamese breakfasts, particularly the lesser-known ones? Let's uncover some hidden culinary gems together and share our love for Vietnamese cuisine. Please share your favorites and any stories or memories you have associated with them. If you have any secret spots or recipes, feel free to share as well!
 Looking forward to reading your responses and expanding my breakfast horizons! 🍽️
 Cheers and happy eating! 🥢

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/Vietnam!
 I'm currently looking into getting the best out of my Phin filter as I recently got a decent hand grinder. People over at r/coffee tend to be pour-over and aeropress guys so I don't read much about other brewing methods there. That's why I decided to ask here. :)
 Any tips on getting the best brew? I personally haven't tweaked much from what I usually do these past months when I first had a phin: Grind 14g of beans using setting 3 (medium fine) for my 6 click cheapo grinder that I bought over at Shopee, preheat the brewer and the glass, dump the grounds on the brewing chamber and shake to level, drop the press filter and press a bit (this one I'm not sure if necessary), pour hot-off-the-boil water about twice the volume of the coffee into the chamber to bloom the grounds and wait for 30 seconds, pour water to the brim of the chamber, then cover to retain the heat. Drip finishes at around 6 mins.
 I usually make coffee via pour-over and I love the different nuances in the process and how each factor affects the output of the brew, But I love the simplicity of the Phin and how no non-sense it is -it's brute force coffee.
 Also, what should I look for if I want to buy a better Phin filter? And if you are a Timemore C2 user, what is your current grind setting?
 I would love to hear from you guys. :) Thanks!

 Only Cambodia, Vietnam, Brunei and East Timor starved their national teams in March.
 But hey, Cambodia is no superpower. Brunei is ASEAN's minnow. East Timor also a minnow. People will not blame them if they didn't schedule.
 But Vietnam? The nation that reached the final round of FIFA World Cup qualification and yet the national team is left starved with domestic league suspended for a month to serve the U-20 and U-23. For what? Professional countries will not interrupt domestic leagues for youth tournaments, only Vietnam does.
 Who is responsible for this? Who deliberately starved the national team?
 Shameful.

 We fly out of HCMC so we're planning on Da Lat being the last place we visit and then getting bus to HCMC the night before our flight (we've both visited HCMC before so don't feel the need to go again).
 Just trying to figure out how many days to spend in Da Lat, i.e. should we do 2 nights, three days or one night, two days bearing in mind we have a small child with us so will probably be sticking to Da Lat rather than going on any trips in the nearby area. 
 What do people think?

 - Easy rider who drives safe and is friendly
 - Small group tour (max 8 people)
 - Staying in authentic homestays 
 - Off the beaten path/away from other tourists as much as possible (acknowledging that I am a tourist myself)
 - 4 days/3 nights would be ideal but open to slightly longer
 Also, I will be coming from Sa Pa, so any advice about transport between Sa Pa and Ha Giang is welcome. Thanks so much!

We wanted to get married next year but we will be 33* (Vietnamese age plus 1 year for Tet) which is a no go according to her mum. I think we then said let’s do it this year but that was also bad and realistically my family couldn’t make it to Vietnam this year. However, we didn’t want to wait until 2025. So after some consultation with a pháp sư her mum said this year was ok and we will have ancestor welcoming (me?) into the family this year on the day of our legal marriage abroad and the wedding ceremony in Vietnam next year, but since it’s unlucky we are just having a “party” not a wedding ceremony. I just found the whole thing kinda confusing. Is this normal across Vietnam?

We’ve only been dating a couple months, but I’ve already met his parents, and while they are very kind to me, I haven’t had a full real conversation with them. It’s always in passing that we exchange words. I’m white and don’t know much about Vietnamese culture or customs, so I’m not sure exactly how to approach them for fear of accidentally coming off as rude or ignorant. I love my boyfriend a lot, and I go to his house and see them pretty often. He doesn’t have a very close relationship with his family, and even they don’t talk much outside of them asking if he’s eaten or where he is, so I’m not sure if he’d be able to help me here. It means a lot to me, having them like me, as I see us having a long future together. Does anyone have any tips or things I should know/necessary knowledge like what is or is not respectful? Or gift ideas to thank them for letting me stay at their house? Anything would be great. Thank you!

 I'd like to meet a fellow redditor over some drinks and food and hopefully make a new friend during my trip if you're comfortable with that as well. 
 If not, I'd still appreciate the advice 🙂
 EDIT: As an introvert, it's a lot harder for me to make new friends and approach random people and start a conversation which is why I made the post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chams, if I remember right, with the fall of Champa, were separated into three groups practising different religions. The Central Chams have largely retained their Hindu belief, although this is practised under a form called "Ba La Mon". The Southern Chams in the Mekong Delta have largely adhered to Sunni Islam and they are the only ethnic group in Vietnam to be Muslims.
 The third Cham group, however, practise a complex religion called "Bani". It was thought to be traced from Persian traders (Persia/Iran was converted to Shia Islam by Shah Ismail I), who spread their Shia Islam to the community during the Vietnamese shogunates (Trinh-Nguyen). However, Bani is unique that it is so synchronised with other religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and even Han and Kinh (Vietnamese) people's folk traditions that it lost most of the original Islamic belief.
 The Bani community is small today but their religious practise has ignited discussions. Some groups believed that they are actually Muslims but with a different characteristic. But some other (including many Banis) disagree with the classification of Bani as a separate Shia Islam sect and instead insist that they are Banis and not Muslims. There is a 2006 documentary called "A Strange Islam" by Agnes De Feo about this community, which put their existence to spotlight.
 Question here is, are Bani people Shia Muslims or just Banis? And what kind of religion Bani is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: My experience in Vietnam is a treasure on my heart. 
 (Rant)I spent time there a few years back. An American in your beautiful country. I think of the smells, the people, the beauty, and the food. Your kindness to me and my travel mate was second to none, from the south to the north. I know it may be required of your culture to be "nice" when you really want to say what needs to be said, but I saw a humble care of the world in which the Vietnamese live, which includes naive tourists. Always kind to me, which I am not used to.
 As an American, I am so thankful for your hospitality. From my perspective, I would have so much animosity towards people like me. Maybe you keep it to yourselves. Or maybe, you just want to move on. A humble strength in family and kindess. 
 Vietnam is one of my fondest memories. I treasure it. I spent a night on a boat in Ha Long Bay. Although I was drunk and silly, the crew invited me and my girlfriend to the kitchen. Vietnamese food and a strange, ridiculously strong sangria. One of the greatest experiences in my life. It was like 345 in the morning!
 I got to sleep in. And the crew, who I think several were celebrating birthdays, were up at like 5! Being hungover on a boat while working sounds impossible. They did it, cause they had to. Tourism is likely the (I don't know) biggest money makers for Vietnam these days I imagine.
 My last night, I got a tattoo on my inner left forearm in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh). I hear that many people tired of their tattoos when they see them everyday. For me? I wax nostalgic and think of how amazing Vietnam was. How it is. And how it treated me and my friend. 
 Not only do I have a great experience. But the people of Vietnam make me want to be a better person. I try everyday. Be humble. Be kind. Make good pho. Regrettably, the latter tastes like salty water. I'll keep trying.
 I miss Vietnam. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a Viet-Kieu who happened to grow up with a very strict Asian mom. I know my mom uses tough love on us but I’m not sure if my mom went out of line disciplining my sister and me.
 These are some of the things she did:
  
She spat and bit me after I didn’t want to wear formal clothes to my friend’s birthday party at age 8. She then clapped and laughed at me after poking holes on my pants with scissors. I cried so hard that day.
 
She cut my pajama pants for refusing to wear anything above the knees.
 
Told me “it was such a huge mistake giving birth to you”.
 
Pour food on head after refusing to eat( I was three at that time).
 
Beat my sister so hard she bled from her mouth when she was 4-5 y.o.
 
Kicked me in the back.
 
Called me “thang dong tinh”( similar to the f-slur) and splashed tea at me for reason number 2 (luckily the tea was cold at that time).
 
Screamed and calling me “thang cho”( a dog) for not bringing a ruler to school.
 
 This happened to me when I was 6-12 y.o. My sister told me my mother was abusive but I don’t think she was since I’ve seen some of my Vietnamese relatives’ parents who did stuffs way worse than my mom did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, for context I'm người Việt born in the US (việt kiều i guess haha), moved to Saigon for ages 4-12, then back to the states for the rest of middle school, high school, uni, and now work here. My parents are from mixed backgrounds, dad a boat refugee from a military family and mom a very upperclass business family in real estate. I've considered moving back after getting a job offer but ultimately decided not to purely because it wouldn't further my career, at least not in the industry I'm in. Really did consider it though since I got lots of family there too
 That being said, I do have very mixed feelings of the current government. On one hand, they freed us from all our colonizers which is something I think all of us feel very proud of and it just feels liberating, you know, knowing…]]></summary>

 Vietnam has the 5th highest in the world , with 111.4 male births (currently) to every 100 females: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sex-ratio-at-birth?tab=table
 This has been a social trend in the country for 30-35 years, but it has accelerated dramatically over the past 10-20 years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Vietnam#/media/File%3AVietnam_population_pyramid_01.04.2019.png
 Any thoughts on this? I can imagine some pretty concerning social issues arising from this in future (if not already)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is not an appropriate place to post this, but I wasn’t sure what other subreddit to post this to.
 I met a Vietnamese guy on a tour last year in South America. We stayed in touch and when I went over to Thailand, we decided to meet up there. I’ve noticed that he is not that polite to hotel and restaurant staff as well as drivers. For example, he doesn’t say thank you when staff brings his drink or food to the table ever. He doesn’t say thank you when we are leaving the restaurant and they are saying thank you and goodbye. He’s not mean to them or anything, he simply ignores them. We hired a driver and instead of walking a few meters to meet the driver, he insisted the driver come into a very tight spot even though it was super inconvenient for the driver to have to back out. I tried to tell him we can just walk up to a more convenient spot and he said no, that we are paying the guy so we will wait for him to come to us.
 I’m wondering if this is just a cultural thing? I am ethnically Vietnamese, however I grew up in the US and my attitude is completely different (I’ve also worked in the hospitality industry so maybe I’m hypersensitive to this). I grew up being taught to be extra nice to hospitality workers because they work very hard but make very little. I get a sense from him that he sees them as beneath them. Is this a common attitude towards staff in Vietnam?

For example, Vietnamese smoke Thuốc Lào, eat Trầu, dye their teeth black, wear darker color outside and colorful inner Áo Mớ Ba Mớ Bảy, and hair keep hair loose. In clothing, we have many hats like Nón Quai Thao, Nón Đinh Tự, Toàn Hoa etc. Just like the chest wrap skirt in the video, we Vietnamese use it with a Round collar robe - Áo Viên Lĩnh inside with hair covering fabric; while others don't.

 I don't want to be disrespectful, but I have a sincere question. 
 I spent a night in a sleeping bus in a lower cabin and the guys from the company had no choice but to sleep on the ground between cabins. One guy spent the entire night spreading his legs right and left, and doing so, he was touching my bottom all night long. I could not sleep because it made me feel really inconfortable. I tried many times to push his legs, but he would do it again, and again and again. 
 I don't understand, because I thought it was very disrespectful to touch people of the opposite sex?
 Is it normal? How should I react if it happens again? Can I ask him to stop doing it or would he be angry? 
 Thank you for your answers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serious question here. Why do so many Vietnamese burn garbage? Outside of the traffic situation, burning of things and the resulting air pollution it causes is without a doubt the most negative aspect of this amazing country. I don’t get it as everything I have seen on fire could have easily been put on virtually any curb for pickup by the garbage crews at least in the cities where smoke impacts a lot of people. 
 It makes me so mad as it not only affects my health, but more so, that of babies and children who are more vulnerable plus ALL of you who live here. Why is this not something the government is cracking down on as the trickle down health effects surely are taking a toll on the nation...even just cognatively as it effects your brain too. Plus, who wants to constantly be getting whiffs of burning plastics and whatnot on the daily? It is 2023 and we KNOW better, so why the ignorance in this particular area here? 
 If you burn things on the regular basis…why? Can you please shed some light as to your motivations? 
 From Wikipedia:
 “The World Health Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide.[6] Studies published in March 2019 indicated that the number may be around 8.8 million.[127] A 2022 review concluded that air pollution was responsible for 6.67 (5.90–7.49) million premature deaths in 2019. It concluded that since 2015 little real progress against (superordinate) pollution, which remained at ~9 million earlier deaths, can be identified.[128][19]00090-0-19) Causes of deaths include strokes, heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections.[6]"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone has some experience on what may be the best approach. For my last two days in Vietnam, I'm struggling to decide on two different scenarios. I'm not deterred by long days and aim to do as much as I can. I've heard Ha Long Bay is more touristy, so I'd like to avoid that if possible. But here are what I've found to be the best scenarios - so if there are other options that I am not thinking of, please share!
 Option One: Day trip excursion from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay. Lasts ~12 hours and allows me to book another one day excursion from Hanoi for the second day. I feel like this will result in roughly 6 hours total of travel back and forth for each day, so seems like I am not getting the most out of my days. But, may allow me to see something else I haven't considered for a day trip.
 Option Two: Depart early AM via train or bus to Cat Ba Island, arriving midday. This allows some brief exploration of Cat Ba National Park. However, the following day it is unclear to be me if I can actually see Lan Hay Bay. I will be leaving out of Hanoi at 2300hrs that night, so need to be back to the airport around 2000hrs. It looks like my options to get back to mainland are to ferry at 1530hrs (ending my day prematurely) or at 1730hrs (getting back too late). Would it even be possible for me to see Lan Ha Bay in this time? The only thing I've found only is departing from 0800 and not arriving back to the island until 1500, which means my only option would be to take the ferry back at 1730. I'd like to make this option work, if I can, to see the mostt of the island but looks like the timing doesn't quite work :(

 Thanks!

 But my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I arrived at Ha Long Bay. The pictures I saw online were nothing like the reality I experienced. It was crowded with tourists and heavily commercialized. I needed to find a hidden gem!
 That's why I'm turning to you, fellow travelers, for help. Do you know of any hidden spots in North Vietnam that are off the beaten path? Maybe a secret waterfall, a secluded beach, or a quaint village with friendly locals?
 I'm on the hunt for something unique and authentic. Something that's not overrun with tourists and where I can truly experience the beauty of Vietnam. So, if you have any recommendations, please share them in the comments below!
 Let's help each other escape the tourist trap and discover the hidden treasures of North Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I wanted to kindly ask for any advice and recommendations regarding possible job opportunities in the tourism/hotel sector of Da Nang/Hoi An. I am 32 years old, originally from Germany. I have BA degree in Southeast Asian and American Studies. I am considering to do a second degree in Tourism/Hotel-Management at an online university in order to be able to work while studying. 
 My overall CV has a lot of "holes" in it, because in my 20s I spent quit a fair amount of time traveling around the globe. I worked seven years as a freelance journalists with a main emphasis on tourism; had countless jobs in restaurants; worked for a company specialized in book trade; and, more recently, been employed as a social worker at a school in Germany. I also have my own little side hustle going on, selling records/cds/cassettes. In addition, I speak Indonesian and Malay, and I am currently trying to advance my Vietnamese language skills. 
 In the near and distant future, I'd like to live and work in Da Nang. I spent a fair amount of time in the city in the recent decade, and I feel very much at home there. My girlfriend lives in Da Nang, too, and we are in committed long term relationship. Therefore, I am considering to find a suitable occupation for myself in the city, and I can picture myself doing a good job in the tourism sector. Online, though, I can barely find any job ads. 
 I'd be very grateful if anyone could give me some honest feedback if I'd be able to get a work permit in the tourism sector in Da Nang with my background; and if so, I'd appreciate any tips on what to keep in mind, what to be careful about, and so forth. 
 Thank you so much in advance! =)

 I was going to use video game themes for them, some are actually from Nintendo. But upon reading about copyrights, i thought it'd be much safer top use something different.
 My question is if I use a popular song in the ceremony, will there be accusations of copyright infringement? I'd like apologize if I asked something dumb, but I'm a 2nd year student, still got a lot to learn, and this is my first time doing such important thing.

I'm so rubbish at cooking but trying to learn and I'm not doing to bad. I just need a simple recipe for the pancakes. I have bacon and shrimp and spring onions for the pancakes.
 The fish sauce dip I have nooooo clue what it's supposed to taste like. I've never tasted fish sauce before. I have lemon 🍋 sugar and the fish sauce. I don't have any chili flakes as I'm making it for my 8 year old daughter too (also I'm a stereotypical English WF who can't handle too much heat! Wahhh ) So any simple step by step for the dip please 🙏 My partner is coming over to visit and I want to impress him.

We have tracked down family of four female, male and two babies all foraging and playing. They seem to have a lot of fun amongst each other, especially the babies. About 30 minutes of watching them they have decided to leave the tree and go further. Male Gibbon went directly above us and let it rip, the poop showered us, my camera, clothes, and my girlfriends clothes. Anyone got similar experience with Gibbons? Our guide told us this never happened on his treks, so I'm just wondering. Amazing experience anyway, would get pooped on by a wild Gibbon any day. 10/10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I've been meaning to discuss a pressing issue that has been on my mind for quite some time now – the uncontrolled building development in Vietnam, particularly the excessive construction of high-rise apartments. It seems that the rapid urbanization and economic growth in recent years have led to a boom in real estate development, but sadly, this has come with a slew of negative consequences.
 To start with, the infrastructure in cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City is severely lacking and has not kept pace with the construction of these massive apartment complexes. The result? Incredibly congested streets, inadequate public transportation systems, and a general decrease in the quality of life for the residents.
 Aside from the obvious traffic and transportation issues, ther…]]></summary>

 Sorry if this seems off-topic but my friend has reached top 10 in the vietnamese league server as well as Challenger in both EUW and NA. I think she has a shot at Saigon Buffalo or another pro vietnamese team but besides emailing them what are some ways she could get her foot in the door?
 I'd ask in the leagueoflegends website but most of them are North American players so I don't think there'd be any vietnamese players. I also think its much harder to break in the vietnamese pro circuit than it is in other regions.
 Any advice appreciated. I can provide her accounts if need be.

 They were pretty polite and nice at the start, but completely lost us at this birthday script. The VNese shop assistant’s reaction was so fake, it’s funny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, we unfortunately were not allowed on our flight from Thailand to Vietnam due to a damaged passport. We do have a flight out of a Hanoi to Tokyo planned in about 6 days.
 Since we were unable to travel on our flight to Vietnam, we are opting to get an emergency passport as the US consulate in Thailand.
 After receiving an emergency passport, would we have any issues trying to fly to Hanoi so we can transfer and get to Tokyo on our flight?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I get it, Donnie Yen publicly support the 9 dash line, I dont like that too … but for real, would banning it do any justice at all when the Vietnamese government themselves, indirectly, publicly, proudly and casually “fund” China’s ambition in the South China sea with hundreds of billions of dollars of economic projects every damn year? Lmao? Not to mention all the Chinese movies and shows that were sponsored and sanctioned by the State and their money, are all over the Vietnamese TVs. 
 Those that know will boycott the movie, the average people dont know shit and will watch it. And watching it doesnt mean you support Donnie Yen’s view … and since the economy is going through a recession, the movie industry is dwindling, the International Court of Arbitration denied the 9 dash line’s legitimacy… why not show it, scrapping some billions VND while at it. 
 Sorry for the rant.

 I will be in HCMC from 26 to 29th of this month, and as a solo traveler it would be nice to grab a drink or 2 and meet new people - are pub crawls a thing in HCMC? Otherwise, can anyone recommend good spots for a solo traveler to grab a drink? I'm not particularly interested in the Bui Vien St kind of nightlife, but rather, good quality bars or pubs with a nice and social atmosphere.
 Thanks!

 I'm considering a study exchange in Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City. The exchange would last about 6 months. I estimate I would need roughly 6 packets of Medikinet (active substance is Methylphenidate). Is that too much too risk for? Is it generally legal to bring that stuff in - in such amounts - every packet has 30 tablets (25mg per each tablet)? What procedures would and should I go through? And finally, what kind of documents - and how prepared - should I bring with me?
 Thx for the answers. 
 PS: I don't think I wanna risk with a bribe haha

We thought my spouse had a muscular injury from weightlifting at a hotel gym 10 days ago. Long story short- he needs a cervical MRI for progressive triceps weakness. Where can we go that would order an MRI that we could get in a timely fashion. I work in medicine and we have and we have exhausted pharmacy options. I know he needs an MRI, so I am specifically looking for a clinic/facility where he could be evaluated and get referred for a n MRI. Thank you.

I'm in Vietnam at the moment and whilst here I was hoping to find some factory seconds from brands that I would normally find back home in Australia. Specifically, Vivobarefoot (a barefoot shoe brand), Patagonia, Arcteryx, North Face, etc. I'm in the north near Hanoi but I'm happy to travel!
 Any information or sharing of contacts would be appreciated. I'm not looking to resell, and I'm mostly needing the gear for trekking. The shoe brand for instance, they are one of the only brands that manafactures in my size (US15), so if I could stock up whilst here that would be helpful. Thanks all.

Not the ones working and providing service to you, but the actually locals that goes to the same sites you’re sight seeing. I think they are local because of their dialect. In Sapa, went to Fansipan. Omg they were pushing in line sandwiching everyone, talking and screaming so loud. The men would smoke when there is a no smoking sign. For Buddhas sake you’re at a temple. 
 Then at Tac coc at Bai Dinh temple, signs are everywhere to be silent or quiet as possible. But these ladies are yelling screaming from a distance. Like can’t you read or have some respect?
 Ok done ranting. Maybe it’s the norm for them. But kinda rub me the wrong way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first week here, I pet my (then) fiancee's family's pet dog. The mutt bit me on the finger and I had to go for 5 rabies shots.
 It was a harrowing welcome to Vietnam, let's just say that!
 I've been chased by a couple aggressive dogs since that, and seen some wild looking dogs just roaming the streets that I don't want anything to do with. 
 I refuse to pet or put myself in any sort of vulnerable position even with friendly dogs. 
 I grew up with pet dogs in the west. To say I'm a dog lover is an understatement. I miss my family's dog so much while I'm here. 
 I never would have thought that I would develop a fear of dogs, but I feel it growing every time I have to walk past an unknown dog on the street. 
 Rabies scares me more than the dogs to be honest... 
 Luckily the family dog didn't have rabies and is still alive. But 5 shots is really annoying to schedule around. Pretty cool they are only $2 though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Went to get a massage here in Hanoi. Massage was 300k and after the massage I assumed 50k would be enough for a tip. But the masseuse refused and so I pulled out a 100k note and she took it and then pointed at the 50k to give to her as well. I don't speak any vietnamese so I just gave it to her as well. Was I ripped off? 50% tip is a little too much imo 😅 I just considered it foreigner tax and won't be going back to that place lol
 Edit: This thread has been polarizing. And for the record it was just a normal 90 minute massage. No extras. And if I'm being honest the massage was not good either. The lady was inconsistent on where to apply pressure and did not do so equally on both sides and just massaged wherever. The place was nice and situated in a somewhat affluent neighborhood so I expected something better.

I just bought a set of cards that I had seen a group of Vietnamese women play a few days ago, and wanted to learn the rules but I can’t find anything convincing on internet (the rules found in Wikipedia don’t make much sense). Anyone has a link to the rules of Tam cúc (which is, I think, the game they were playing, as they had these thin Chinese cards)?
 Thanks a bunch! Will keep on looking online in case I find anything.
 Extra question: anyone knows where to import to Europe the cool plastic or wooden stools found at the street food stalls/bars?
 Edit: If someone knows the rules, could I send a DM with my doubts on the rules found online?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I ask because I've seen quite a few articles about how extremely easily-offended many Vietnamese immigrant communities, especially in Seattle and throughout California and Texas, are when they see the modern flag, equating it with the Confederate and Nazi flags, and have forced many institutions to use the traditional yellow one instead.
 I kinda wonder if it's as serious as local news outlets say it is or if it's all gross exaggerations that inadvertently make the Vietnamese community look bad. Because taken to the logical extreme, it would mean Hardee's/Carl's Jr and Steven Universe would be protested against or banned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically, renting a bike and riding from HCMC to Hanoi later this year.
 Planning to rent either a Honda Blade or Honda XR150. The dates I will be travelling are from 24th Oct to the the 4th of November. 
 So I have currently planned 10 days of riding.
 Day 1: HCMC to Cat Tien Day 2: Cat Tien to Dalat Day 3: Dalat to Phan Thiet Day 4: Phan Thiet to Nha Trang Day 5: Nha Trang to Mang den Day 6: Mang Den to Hoi an Day 7: Hoi an to Hue Day 8: Hue to Phong Nha Day 9: Phong Nha to Mai chau Day 10: Mai Chau to Hanoi
 Now here is my dilemma. I am very time restricted and only have 12 full days to complete this ride. Is it possible to do this? Am I an idiot for even considering this? Will I make it in time considering weather etc? I am a very experienced rider, so riding in the rain does not bother me, but will floods and such stop me? Any recommendations or considerations would be much appreciated.

 I am used to solo traveling, and sometimes I schedule solo trips for my birthday to celebrate it on a different way. Every time I did this I had an amazing time with the people I met randomly during the trips! 
 This year I've chosen to do this in Vietnam and I was thinking on spending this day on a 2-days cruise to Ha Long Bay. My other options are Hanoi itself or maybe Da Nang. I am, however, scared that these cruises are full of closed groups or families and I end up having a not-so-pleasant experience. 
 For those who did this already, what do you think? Is there any other alternative you strongly suggest? Side note: turning 33. 
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y’all! I’m currently visiting Vietnam from the US with my friend. I’m going to have some free time and l would like to try to meet some people and hang out. I don’t speak the language so that’s been tough so I know it’s a bit of a long shot lol. I am traveling with my friend who speaks the language but I’ll be having some down time to go out and explore a bit. I’ll be in Nha Trang, Da Nang, and Saigon. I enjoy live music, sight-seeing, coffee, bars, of course food! Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do and how i can meet locals? Or even other travelers? I’m not a super extroverted person so this is uncharted territories for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to Vietnam for 2 weeks in May, I’m just looking for some ideas on how to fill my time being there. 
 My basic itinerary is the following
 Flying into Hanoi and going straight to Halong bay for 3 days Going back to Hanoi for 3 days Flying to Ho Chi Minh for 3 days Flying to Da Nang for 3 days 
 I’m going with my partner but she’s there for work for the first few days in Halong and we’re meeting in Hanoi 3 days later. 
 Just looking for some ideas on the solo 3 days in Halong for a somewhat adventurous guy, I plan on doing a day cruise and a Hike but don’t know how to fill the other couple days there. 
 I enjoy architecture and scenery I plan to enjoy in Hanoi, but any must sees would be amazing to hear. 
 The Ho Chi Minh trip I plan on doing the walking street and unsure how to fill the other days. 
 Da Nang I plan on doing the hands bridge and enjoying the beach I think doing the marble mountain as well and doing a trip to Hà Nội as well. 
 Any input, on how to fill the days is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend (20) has lived in Latvia (Europe) for around 5 years now. He went to highschool here, speaks the language, goes to university and soon will be eligible for a citizenship here. To get it, he needs to renounce the Vietnamese citizenship but he told me that it can be a very long and difficult process. Does anyone have experience with it? Is it really that difficult?
 Another thing - he has not done the military training and is not planning to as he wants to spend his life in Latvia. But he has to go to Vietnam this summer to renew his ID. I'm worried he might get into trouble for avoiding the training so I'm quite worried about him going there. Can anyone give me some insight on this?

 Of course 2 weeks are not enough to see all those beautiful spots/things, but I have a very detailed itinerary I prepared myself and I already know I will want to come back 😍
 The advice I would love to receive from you is what can I buy there that is way cheaper than in Europe. I am only thinking to buy stuff for myself, but it is not that clear to me if there are really all these opportunities like it seems reading online. 
 Appreciate any tips
 Thanks folks 😃🖐🏼

 Relaxing its visa policy and extending visa-free stay for eligible countries.
 Developing new products and services that cater to the diverse needs and preferences of travelers.
 Promoting its natural beauty, cultural heritage and gastronomy as unique selling points.
 Leveraging its strong economic ties with neighboring countries and potential markets.
 What is your thought?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some advice from vietnamese families/women or anyone who has done this before in a vietnamese context. 
 I'm the only expat in my community and I'd really love to start a mom's group to get to know the others in the community better. I know the concept is probably not normal for Vietnam but would anyone have any suggestions on what sort of things would be a "draw" for a mom's group? I know how the groups are in my home country but my husband says if I just say "a time to share together, talk together, and learn from each other" no one will come (I kind of agree). I also don't want it to seem like a kid drop-off time if I say we will do things like have storytime and snacks. 
 What in your opinion would be some activities that would make a monthly group/meet-up for vietnamese moms exciting and worthwhile? 
 (For context, the group will be in vietnamese, and not in a large city setting) 
 Thanks!

 Are there any shops in Hanoi selling old (used) comics, books and magazines?
 When i'm abroad i'm always looking for comic books in the native language, especially Donald Duck (Donald và bạn hữ) but also the franco-belgian stuff like Tintin, Lucky Luke and Asterix. It seems all this series were published in Vietnam at least two decades ago but not any longer. I guess Mangas are the big thing now.
 A couple of years ago (2017?) in HCMC i stumbled across a street (can't remember which district) with shop on shop where old magazines were pieled up in front. I found a lot of stuff but it was just the first week of our trip and my wife would've killed me if we had to carry a ton of comics for a month...
 Are there any of these shops in Hanoi. I've been to Đinh Lễ Street and Nhà sách Mão already (these pop up when you google). But all i got was one new Tintin at Trang Tien bookstore. A lot of shops i found on Google Maps which seemed very promissing are actually closed (Covid i guess).
 Thanks!

 We're visiting Vietnam for the first time, and after seeing HCMC, Hanoi, Ha Long, and Da Nang/Hoi An we're considering for location to work one week remotely before heading home - thus, where would you stay and why (at end of April)?
 My initial consideration is:
 a) to avoid HCMC and Hanoi and due to hecticness
 b) to avoid Nha Trang due to the potentially high amount of russian tourists/ex-pats
 c) to highly consider staying in Da Nang/Hoi An and renting a villa
 Thank you in advance for your opinions! Much appreciated!

I live near a Vietnamese Catholic church and I was always curious to observe a Catholic mass. Would I be judged for visiting a Vietnamese Catholic church on a random Sunday? As a Vietnamese person I notice that older Vietnamese individuals can be judgemental/gossip and as someone who usually wears head coverings to church out of respect and religious focus, I don't want to stick out too much.

I always see a group of Vietnamese plays together and trash-talking other players in their language. Their English is too bad that they even think the word trash-talking is swearing, and I were calling they are trash - I have no word. Kept trash talking about me because of the language barrier, I understand 100% what they said. However, they didn't listen and always thought that I did something wrong to them, then spread the misunderstanding to their friends... Became really toxic, killed me in spawn because they have a gang,...
 If you are the member in that gang, please. Stop making the image of a friendly country turning into a toxic place where every one of my friends always warn me to stay away from them online (even Vietnamese friends advised me it)
 I also wonder if it is the majority of your community is like that, or I'm just unlucky?

I'm planning to do the Ha Giang loop next week and heard they're checking for checking for licenses quite frequently nowadays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought a 30 day MobiFone Sim about 3 weeks ago, meant to be 4gb data a day, so 120gb total. Yesterday, two friends of mine, and my own SIM card seemed to suddenly cut out and the data isn’t working and hasn’t worked today either. I don’t think I’ve managed to use 120gb, anyone have any idea? Any help is massively appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking as someone who loves baseball, I find it really cool that Vietnamese people are rocking my team’s brand (San Francisco Giants). Ofc it’s not as popular as the Yankees, Red Sox and D*dgers but I understand that MLB is more of a fashion brand and I’m sure most people who wear the brand probably don’t care about baseball at all but it just hits close to home seeing people rocking with it. Would be even better to get more people interested in the game.

I don't remember the lyrics, but I remember the music videos to a certain degree.
 Song #1: This music video in particular showed a feud between two gangs I'm assuming. I vividly remember a scene where one gang is sitting around a table playing poker, and polishing their guns. I guess shit hit the fan, cause then they pulled up in a limo to the airport, and the other gang got off the airplane, and they just started fighting. LMAO
 Song #2: The MV was of a guy that looked like he was in a jail cell or something, and he was making a sculpture of a woman, and he went all deranged and destroyed the clay…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife is from Vietnam but has been living in the US for 8 years. Her parents have been living here longer, and no longer have any Vietnamese citizenship papers. The question concerns them.
 Due to circumstances they put their properties in the name of a relative who still lives in Vietnam, but now they wish to change that. Because they no longer have their citizenship papers, and it takes a long time to get them again, they cannot put the properties in their names. What sort of options do they have?
 I was wondering if there was a kind of trust they could use to own the property, but have the trust be controlled by them, or, at the very least, have it be controlled by a relative still in Vietnam, but with their name attached in some way that requires their consent for anything to be done to the property. They are old and probably too trusting, I want to see if there is any way we can help protect their interests as well as possible. They said they already spoke to an attorney, but I am not sure they spoke to the right kind or asked the right questions.
 Any help is appreciated.

Mình đang ở canada theo diện work permit nên sẽ có 3 năm để làm việc và cũng như cơ hội để kiếm thẻ xanh ở đây. Nhưng mà hiện tại thì em cảm thấy rất muốn về VN để sinh sống và làm việc cũng như được ở gần gia đình và bạn bè hơn. Nên mình dự tính là vẫn sẽ ở canada làm việc 2-3 năm để có thêm kinh nghiệm (và bằng CPA ). Mình chỉ đang thắc mắc là nếu trường hợp mình như vậy thì về vn có ổn không ạ? Và vấn đề lương thì mọi người thấy như thế nào? Mình thật sự rất cần lời khuyên ngay lúc này vì mình cảm thấy rất nhớ Việt Nam. Nếu quyết định về VN thì mình nghĩ lương sẽ không thể nào bằng được như ở CA được, nhưng mình nghĩ mình sẽ thoải mái hơn vì được gần gia đình và bạn bè và cũng như được ăn những món mình thích hoặc buồn thì cứ xách xe lên mà đi 1 vòng thôi. Nhưng nếu lương không ổn thì cũng hơi stress 1 tí. 
 Cho mình cảm ơn mọi người nhiều.
 Hi everyone. I have just graduated from the university majoring in accounting and currently working as an accountant in Big4. I am in Canada on a work permit so I will have 3 years to work as well as the opportunity to apply for a green card. But now, I really feel like going back to Vietnam to live and work so I can be closer to my family and friends. I’m planning to stay in Canada to work for 2-3 years to gain more experience (and getting CPA). Is ok to go back to Vietnam after that? And what about the salary expectation? I really need some advices right now because I miss Vietnam so much. If I do decide to return to Vietnam, I don't think the salary will be as good as compared to CA, but I think I will be happier since I can be closer family and friends .
 Thank you and I really appreciate any advices/ suggestions/ inputs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm currently in Southeast Asia and will be arriving in Vietnam in late April. I originally planned to do the motorbike loop in Ha Giang independently on rented bikes, but that was before I learned about needing a motorcycle license. I don't want to risk my insurance being void, so that's out of the question now. 
 I was pretty set on doing it independently without a company, so this threw a real wrench in my plan. I've already decided to skip travelling to Northern Thailand because of burning season, so I know I'll be back to the area, so my question is whether I should wait until I have a motorcycle license and do it later in life, or just suck it up and do it with an easy rider. 
 The reason I'm posting is just to hear how it went for other people. I don't love not being in control of my own bike, I'm somewhat introverted so the social aspect isn't huge, I like being able to stop and check out little shops or side roads, and I'm concerned with a bigger group that I won't be able to do this. I don't really have the money to do a private tour, and even doing it with an easy rider is putting a bit of a stretch on my budget. 
 Overall though, I'm wondering if I should still just do it. I suppose I'm just looking for stories of how people felt using easy riders and whether they felt like they would have had a better time doing it solo. The loop was the one thing I wanted to do the most out of Southeast Asia, but I'm wondering if I should just do it later when I can fully enjoy it. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Looking for some advice - let me know if this isn’t the right place. Friend and I are planning to ride 110cc bikes from north to south, weaving from mountains to coast in April/May. 
 We are fully licensed to ride motorcycles in the US and have been riding for years. Fully understand that riding there is different and we take that seriously. Would be wearing protective gear and staying off the roads that don’t allow bikes. The US IDP provided by AAA lists Vietnam as “not party to the 1949 convention but honors IDP”. This is a little confusing as Vietnam did sign the Geneva convention in 1953. So while we aren’t terribly worried about being allowed to do this, we are having trouble finding medical insurance coverage since there doesn’t appear to be any laws that explicitly say US citizens can rent or drive any type or vehicle there. We’ve read about certain companies that would provide medical coverage anyway as long as you are licensed and qualified in your home country but haven’t found one yet.
 Is anyone aware of a way we can do this? Or any companies that expats or travelers have used successfully recently? I’m not willing to ride without medical coverage so I would need to travel by other means or go somewhere else. This is a trip I’ve been thinking of doing for years - I’d be extremely bummed to have to see this beautiful country out a train window and not be able to experience the smaller mountain communities along the journey (I’d also need to do the trip alone in this case). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spent 9 days traveling in Vietnam. Started from Hoi An and kept moving to Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, and ended at Ho Chi Minh. Used different modes of transport, met tons of people, and experienced things that I'm truly grateful for.
 My experiences helped me break a lot of stereotypes and prejudices that were told to me before my visit. Vietnam is not a country for cheap shopping or fake stuff or weird food. it's not a country where people will con you or misguide you. It's not a country that is rude, indifferent, or selfish.
 After 9 days in Vietnam, I'm taking back memories of meeting kind locals who go out of their way to help you, friendly shopkeepers who give you a small sovenieur as good luck because you made them smile while bargaining, helpful grab drivers who gave you a genuine smile just because you bowed and offered with money with both hands, Bar tenders and staff, who booked grab for me and offered a free drink just because i was nice to them. At every situation I got stuck or lost, I was given direction by locals who didn't have to give a fuck about me. After traveling many places in the world, I sincerely believe that if tourists remove their stereotypical blindfolds, they can experience a truly beautiful country I.e. Vietnam. ❤️ And that's what I'm taking back to India with me.
 P.S: I would like to offer my hospitality if anyone is planning to travel to India, especially Mumbai. Over and out.

 It's my first time initiating something like this, so I need help. Here's my thought process:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: trying to find an old family graveyard. I know it’s hopeless, but maybe someone here has some advice lol
 My grandmother’s grandmother is from Huế, my grandmother’s family is from Tra Vinh, where we went to a family graveyard when we went to Vietnam for the first time this summer. We were able to come there since our family still has contact with Hmong people (?) that used to work for the family who own it now. It had the graves of many family members except one, my grandmother’s grandmother: Nguyễn Thị Điệm (born ca. 1880). Although there was a picture of her with her date of death: 20 Aug 1916. My grandmother told me that she was buried in Huế with her family, and that her brother who now lives in the US visited the grave in 2000 via contact with the gravekeepers, although she has not had contact with him for a long time, and does not seem very keen on doing it either. Apparently her brother (my greatuncle) is also not that bright due to his years in the camp.
 The family was apparently very rich, and were according to my family close to the emperor, I know nothing else except that Nguyễn Thị Điệm’s brother was a very prestigious or conceited photographer.
 I know its probably hopeless, but does anyone maybe have any advice on how i should find (how to contact) the graveyard (owners)? Or any other advice?
 Or just drop your personal family stories in the comments:)

 How does it work typically? I work for an MNC and while I do not want to go into the zone of corruption, I do want to understand the dynamics between seller/customers. 
 Do people typically go KTVs for some 'fun' or is it usually in normal dinner places or what not? Are gifts expected?

 So I'm actually a half Filipino half Vietnamese(dad filipino, mom vietnamese), when I was 7 years old, my mom was ask to go back to Vietnam since she's been overstayed here in the Philippines, and promised to comeback after she fix the issue, and in the first few months we still have a communication with her and then suddenly gone, no calls, letter, etc.
 I am now 24 years old, Ive been searching for her for years, I do not wish her to come back to our lives, I just wanted to know how was she's been doing. I tried searching her on facebook but no luck, cuz everytime I searched her full name a lot of the accounts has the same or similar names, I even include my middle name which is "Nguyen" in my facebook so its easier for her to find me.
 And I'm not even sure if this is right sub to post this, and sorry if my writing is scuffed, and also my english😅😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long time ago I had a Vietnamese student who would say something anytime he would get a wrong answer or anytime he was frustrated. When I asked him about he said it was like a bad word. 
 It was a single word with a long s at the end.... Like "hasssss" or "hesssss"
 Would really like to know what the word actually was, hopefully he wasn't calling me a dickhead! Haha

 I will be traveling for 4 months around South East Asia and am looking to buy medical insurance.
 All the providers I've seen (including reputable ones like TrueTraveller or World Nomads) say it on their fine print that they only cover medical treatment in state-run hospitals.
 I am looking for a provider that would foot the bill from a private hospital.
 Does anyone know of any providers?
 Thanks!

 I plan to travel to Da Nang via Ho Chi Minh City. The plane ticket that I am looking at has 1 hour 50 minutes layover in HCMC Airport. The airport's domestic terminal doesn't seem so far away from the international terminal. But being a foreigner, I need to go though the customs and immigrations, which I heard could take approximately an hour.
 Would I have enough time to catch the connecting flight to Da Nang or should I get another ticket that has a 3 hour layover?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am Vietnamese girl dating an expat for the 1st time, plz give me some advices. I live in Hanoi, he lives in HCM so this is the first time dating. He asks me to show him around when we meet in Hanoi. I was kinda passive in the relationships with other Vietnamese boyfriends before, like they picked me up to dating locations. Thus, I don’t know how to take the lead in dating with an expat in Hanoi. Which type of transportation used when we date? I don’t have car driving license. Pick him up by a motorbike I drive is bit weird, isn’t it? Have you been in this situation? Plz share your experience. Kindly introduce me some places that expats want to hangout in Hanoi. We are both in twenties. Much appreciated!
 Edit: Thank so much for your advice. Most of them are very helpful. I am way too overthinking. I was worried about the size difference if I drive him on a bike, im like 5’1 feet while he is 6’2 feet. But, I will ask him what he wants to choose bike or cab although bike is the my most preferred transport when hanging out in Hanoi. To whom who may wish me luck with green card: he is not even a Western. He is my Hindu colleague. We hit it off and accept a long distance relationship. That’s it. Now Vietnamese girls don’t date expats for money. We can be both cute and rich at the same time. Get used to it.

 I am visiting Vietnam in July this year for a close friend's wedding. Just wondering what Vietnamese people typically give their friends and loved ones as a wedding gift? I've actually never been to any wedding as an adult so I'm a bit lost and gifting in a completely different culture makes it feel even more daunting. I would love to hear some examples of what you would typically choose as a wedding gift.
 Also - Other foreign friends who are going have said they are just going to give the couple money, is this normal/acceptable in Vietnam? And if so, how much should one typically give?
 Appreciate any insights, cheers

 I'm very interested in the Vietnam war and already know plenty about it, so visiting something like this seem like a natural choice but at the same time I hate things that are too touristy and this seem exactly that. People posing for dumb pictures, like thousands of others before them, standing on destroyed tanks or in entrances to one of the tunnels.
 Would you recommend it?

 I am planning on traveling in Northern Vietnam this month. The air quality apps show really high PM 10 and PM 2.5 numbers, meaning the air is hazardous for health.
 I was wondering - is this casual for that side of the country or is it because of the burning season, similarly to Northern Thailand?
 Maybe anyone currently travelling there could share there experiences?
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Community,
 I'm in Da Nang for the next 7 weeks and love it so far. But still did not meet any local women, which I obviously wouldn't mind. I would like to go out tomorrow night, I don't mind going solo. And then, I am usually not afraid to talk with a women if there seems to be an ''opening''. I value a good friendship, and nice communication / talk, even if nothings happens afterwards. It's really mostly about meeting local people/women and ''why not if more''.
 What would be the best nightclubs to easily meet local people who are more likely to be ''into foreigners'' (I am in my thirties, very healthy and tall, I think I can be doing ok) and more likely to be able to talk a bit or good English ? Avoiding places full of ''pro's'' and full of Koreans could be a good thing I imagine :D (but I imagine it's not always avoidable).
 Thanks in advance !

 Bảy cô lùn đi cùng ông tuyết

 một giấc mơ suýt thì hoàn chỉnh

 ​
 We are going to Vietnam for 2 weeks late March with my wife (28 and 25 year old): 5 days in HCM, 3days in Phu Quoc and 5days in Hanoï.
 ​
 In Hanoï we are thinking going there:
  
Hanoi Train Streets
 Ha Long Bay : do you recommend 2days/1night or 3days/2nights?
 Vietnam Military History Museum
 Hoàn Kiếm Lake
 Don Xuan market
 French quarter
  
​
 HCM:
  
Ben Thanh market
 An Dong market
 War remnants Museum
 Vincom Center
 Nam Cat Tien park
 Nguyen Hue walk
 Mekong Delta
  
​
 Do you have any recommendations or advices? 
 Also, I am a bit clueless on the best transportation to go to Ha Long Bay or Mekong Delta. In the city, I planned to use Grab or Go-jek.
 ​
 Thanks in advance :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ll be in Vietnam for a month soon with another month in Thailand before i return to Vietnam for another few weeks. I live in Europe and I’m not sure how mobile networks work outside European Union. I’m looking for a good few GBs of data 20-30GB allowance with a few national calls for hostels and local calls. Do Vietnamese providers offer roaming in neighbouring countries like you’d get in Europe? What are the prices like and what are my options? All help appreciated.
 I actually work for a big provider in my home country where it’s unlimited national data + 19GB anywhere in the EU for €20 . I’d love to find something similar if possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years ago I was constantly seeing stories about how Vietnam had the highest economic growth in Southeast Asia. Was getting massively invested in by Japan and Korea, and had tons of companies relocating to it from China during the Sino-American trade war. Many YouTubers I was watch on the ground said they could see the explosive growth year by year as it felt like the early days of China as it was beginning to achieve great economic success. The everyday life was becoming tangibly better year by year.
 But I checked in again recently, and I saw the GDP growth has massively faltered the past two years, and also saw that the previous economics minded president has seemingly been replaced by a more politics minded one.
 So I was just wondering, does Vietnam still seem to be on track for explosive growth and this is just a short break because of COVID or is the growth really slowing down? Is life still improving year by year in Vietnam to a noticable degree?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am on Phu Quoc right now and I see it again. Huuuuge luxury hotels, but nearly completely empty. When I look the price up its 5M Dong a night. 5M Dong. 
 How do these luxury hotels even survive? Why they don’t lower the price?
 It seems like the hotel owners are so crazy rich they don’t care about some losses and don’t want to lower the prices to not lose image or something. (imagine you pay $200 for a hotel and some months later it’s $100 a night because of low demand. in Europe or also in Thailand, hotels dgaf and just lower the price to get at least some customers, but here it’s not like that). Or?? I can’t understand it pls explain me guys
 Also this Vin Grand World has sooo many restaurants and stuff with expensive food, but most of them are completely empty because it’s too expensive when you could get outside the same food for much lower price. 
 It seems like the “market” with demand offer etc doesn’t really work for these giants they just dgaf about losses, or is there some bigger story behind that? I also remember how people in this sub once talked how expensive vinfast cars became or smth like that

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 Have you stayed in a hotel in the Old Quarter recently?
 I visited Hanoi in 2018, 2019 and again in 2022. The hotels had changed a lot in 3 years as many had been affected by Covid and the flood damage. While no doubt it's down to the unfortunate circumstances, the last couple of places I stayed in 2022 were nothing like the photos/reviews, were damaged and run down.
 Bringing the family along in 2023 and would like to know your recommendations for a nice place to stay.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I visited Hanoi for a few weeks and went to some clubs too. In most clubs the sold balloons and I was told they contain laughing gas. Saw some people getting really high on it and kinda knocked out sometimes.
 Friend handed me (already very drunk) one and I tried it several times excessively but had no reaction.
 First, I don't know if laughing gas is illegal. Some clubs were really suspicious and you had to talk to some guy around a corner to get through some secret gate. Somehow you couldn't here any of the loud music outside.
 And second could we get scammed? Is selling fake gas a thing? I'm not a fan and won't do it ever again, but I'm really interested in understanding what happened there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone, Yeah it's another Vietnam itinerary.
 I'm traveling with my wife from India to spend around 2 weeks in this country on our anniversary. Need help in making an itinerary that has a balance of both a little fast and relaxed overall.
 But I'm too confused to jot down the itinerary completely, mainly in the number of days to spend in a city. Some parts are fixed though.
 Fixed (15 days): 14th April '23 to 28th April '23,
 Flights Booked and stay booked for Phu Quoc
 14th arrival (Ho Chi Minh) Going to Phu Quoc directly
 14th to 16th (Phu Quoc)
 28th departure (Hanoi)
 I want to cover the country from south to central to the north, with the 19th being preferred not traveling as it's our anniversary that day.
 Uncertain (16th to 28th):
 No Stay or Travel option booked
 16th to 18th: Ho Chi Minh Stay
 18th to 19th: Nha Trang, can this be skipped? as it'll make us travel on the 19th to Hoi An/Da nang
 19th to 21st: Hoi An, Da nang, and Ba Na Hills (Unable to select dates to stay where on which date, maximizing things to do in each place)
 22nd to 28th: Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Sa pa
 We want to cover Ninh Binh and Phong Nha National Park as well but that doesn't seem to be possible as this above draft itself feels a little rushed. We are already removed Dalat and Hue from our itinerary for the same reason, doesn't want it to be too fast-paced.
 Now I want help with what place we can omit if this itinerary looks too rushed or not possible.
 Any other suggestion for a newbie in Vietnam please do suggest!

 Has anyone ever heard of a store in Saigon called Kallos? It’s located in D10 and they have items I want to get for myself and others, however I cannot find anyone (so far) who has either heard of them or shopped there. 
 They’re an outlet (similar to Vincom) and have excellent professional reviews and items, nice FB page, reviews and it’s run by a Korean man who opened up his own shop. But it would be very reassuring to know if someone has actually shopped here before. 
 If either anyone here, or you have someone who has shopped here before, please let me know and the most important let me know if the products you bought were authentic or fake because this is what I’m worried about more than anything. I attach an image of the address and business as well. Kallos Vietnam

 I have a driver's license in Germany for cars only and I have a Vietnamese passport but my residence is in Germany.
 I would like to bring an international Driver's license back to Vietnam to ride a motorbike legally. I know I just need to do a practical test.
 My question is: will my licence have a short expiry date like foreigners who stay in Vietnam for a limited time? Or will the license expiration date be the same as my driver's licence in Germany because I have Vietnamese citizenship? I have no residence in Vietnam.
 My plan is to use the license again for multiple visits. It will take time for the license to be issued, so I can't afford the time to get the license every time I visit Vietnam.
 (Yes, I know I can drive illegally and bribe officers, but I want my health and liability insurance to pay for higher damages if I ever get into a serious accident)

I really want to go back at some point and I’m curious as to how much Hanoi has changed. Some things I remember:
 Roads were like 90% motorcycles, 7% cars, and 3% bikes
 Sông tô lịch was literally just an open sewer (please tell me this has gotten better lmao)
 No one wore seatbelts, and while I was there when people began being required to wear helmets, a lot of people wouldn’t buckle them
 Cutting in line was very common 
 Crosswalks weren’t a thing, you just walked across the street and people swerved around you
 Has any of this changed?

 Era was recommended by my hotel but I had low expectations. I'm happy to say that the food and service were magnificent. 
 Duan and his wife are foodies and it shows in the taste and presentation of the good eats they serve at their restaurant. After a short chat I learned that Duan is self-taught cook and that he and his wife love to experiment with recipes. His methodology puts me in mind of a food scientist. 
 I left very full. Very happy. And, very satisfied. I finally had a meal that was worth all the hype.

 I was on a tour with another company when I realized the return time to Halong Bay City would make me late for a transfer to Hanoi. I was assured at booking that there would not be a conflict but that was not the case. 
 I saw Thao's boat departing (a completely different company) and asked if I could hitch a ride back to the city with them. Both the captain and Thao, the tour guide, agreed to let me come along. 
 But, it gets better. Thao called my hotel so I could grant permission for the transfer driver to pick-up my luggage. 
 He also called the transport company to arrange an alternate pick-up location and changed my pick up time. Then Thao had one of his wait staff to rush me to the new pick-up location on the back of her scooter. Thanks to them I made it to Hanoi and now sit comfortably in my hotel room. 
 Thao refused a tip and I paid a nominal fee to the captain and the waitress/motorbike driver. In fact, the waitress returned half of the very small fee I paid her and refused when I insisted she keep all of it. 
 I'm so grateful to Thao and the staff for helping a complete stranger. They truly went above and beyond earning them the LifeSaver award. Many thanks to them all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love living in Vietnam 🇻🇳 ❤️ but the thing that kills me is the unnecessarily LOUD TRUCK HORNS. My ears hurt and it startles me (sometimes to the point of crashing) every time one of them decides to blare their cargo ship horn near me. I get alerts on my Apple Watch all the time about how the noise level could cause hearing loss. Oh and the way they drive is insane too! This happens all the time: a big ol 🚛 barreling down the road in the lane traveling the opposite direction from me ENTERS INTO MY LANE, and almost literally RUNS ME OFF THE ROAD. Keep in mind, as a guy driving a motorbike, I’m already in the habit of riding on the very edge of the road, but in the interest of safety, I’ve had to go off the road so many times because some impatient cargo truck driver can’t stand to behind another car so they invade a lane of oncoming traffic whenever they feel like it.
 Back to the horn problem…it has caused numerous deaths. It’s so loud that it had caused people to be startled to the point of falling off their motorbike and getting hit by the semi trucks or getting into deadly accidents with other vehicles from loss of control. It happens too much, and although there is technically a law against it but the penalty (like 2-3tr vnđ) is so light compared to the damage it causes.

 I bought them from a store in China, it costs about 365 dollars. The store decided to deliver my package by Fedex (Air way).
 It was shipped quickly from HongKong to Ho Chi Minh for about 3 days, but then it got stuck at a clearance process for over a week. Now I have no clue what I need to do next since Fedex Vietnam keeps asking me to wait.
 For those having the same experiences, is that your typical durations for an import custom process to Vietnam? This is a first time I buy a product from foreign countries so I am little shock.

 Iced milk coffee
 According to the culinary website Taste Atlas, Vietnam's iced coffee ranks second among the top 10 best coffees in the world.
 Taste Atlas describes, Vietnamese iced coffee is a combination of dark black coffee with condensed milk and ice.
 Traditionally, iced milk coffee must be made from medium or coarsely ground Vietnamese coffee, typically Robusta.
 The way to make Vietnamese coffee is also unique, unlike anywhere else in the world when pouring hot water through a small filter to let each drop of concentrated coffee flow into the cup, then it will be mixed with condensed milk and added ice.
 Please enjoy once if you have the opportunity to visit Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am currently traveling with my girlfriend in Vietnam and we have some questions about the phone service. In Saigon we bought a SIM for 200,000d. Even though he only half understood us, we were pretty sure he meant we have 4gb per day for 30days. (is this Even a possible price?) After 5 days the internet stopped working. I had internet again the next day and got a message in the evening the 1gb/day was used up. You get but on dozens of other messages that tell something about tariffs but translated only make half sense. Can I ignore them? (I know this from South America where you were often spammed with fake stuff). And do you know which messages you can take seriously?
 Also, how does the charging work? I have seen that there is a short code *101#. In general, I am a bit clueless and would need someone to explain the whole thing to me. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 Quick question again, basically I have very specific hair needs since I have nice, natural curly hair. There is a specific moisture cream that makes my curls extremely luxurious that I really cannot do without now. Because otherwise my hair will be very dry and frizzy and coarse. 
 My question, would my package either be seized or held up with customs when shipping the product? Mind you, I will not be shipping any electronics or perishables (food) or anything like this ever, I would only ever need to order skin/hair care from South Korea to Vietnam. The shop I order from is KoreaDepart, they ship everywhere, however my question is not with them it’s about can I get the products into Vietnam without being seized or held up and having to pay out the ass in fees. 
 The product…]]></summary>

 Does Vietnam or Cambodia have better wildlife rainforests?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see posts a lot where it is usually a foreigner marrying a girl from VN. However, does anyone have experience with marrying a man from VN as a foreigner?
 I'm not really a foreigner either, I'm a VK but don't speak vietnamese at all, but I do speak a chinese dialect and was able to get around a little in VN when I was there for 1 month. During that time, I met someone that is too perfect. We aren't dating, just friends, we met accidently. His family runs a little food shop/stand and I couldn't speak Vietnamese so he stepped in to help and we just started talking since I was there during slow business time.
 Prior to that I also thought about moving to VN to stay closer to family. I also like VN but I feel like I am romanticizing it too much and the reason I like it is because I can escape from my problems (work burnout).
 ​
 I don't really know what I really want to ask. I just want to hear from people about their experience. Since men and women in VN can be different in a relationship because of culture. I don't want to start a relationship and get his hopes up since he is older than me with aging parents.

 Does anyone know how to get your social security insurance contributions or a law firm that could help? 
 I am moving back to the states and was told by my HR Rep that the government can only give me a plaque/certificate with the years worked, not MONEY
 I am owed a decent amount of money and the government has refused to pay, I heard this was also a problem in china but know of friends getting their money there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember being very interested in Vietnam's Tay Son period ever since I was as young as 7, and I remember always feeling extremely unwell hearing about all these Tay Son bloodlines and everything, including famous generals like Bùi Thị Xuân and her daughter getting stomped to death by elephants. Or the ensuing executions of Nguyễn Nhạc's children by having them sawed in half. Despite it being years later, I still feel sad reading about the infamous Nguyen Lord and later Gia Long's rampage against Quang Trung's monarch. But then It is also my responsibility to be aware that part of his bloodlust was also due to the fact that he had witnessed the killings against his own family when the Tay Son swept down South.
 Humans are scary.
 If anyone else has any insight or corrections which I know will be inevitably pointed out, I would totally love to hear them and see what else I needed to learn about this event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to Vietnam next month, going from Ho Chi Minh, through central Vietnam and ending in Hanoi. 
 I don’t eat pork or shellfish , and would prefer not to eat any other meat such as chicken or beef. 
 How easy will it be to find options that are ‘chay’ when I am out exploring? How easy will it be to avoid fish sauce, which I know contains shrimp, for example? 
 Is there anything I could buy in a supermarket that is vegetarian that I could quickly grab and go, if I’m in a hurry ?
 Many thanks! 😊

 One tip i have received, is buying an AirTag, and putting it on personal belongings. This is great way of utilizing technology we have in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking into getting a loan in Vietnam as a foreigner for a property purchase. 
 Did not have much luck with banks. Most do not offer loans for foreigners, or people living outside of HN or SG. Vietnam Russia Bank (VRB) seemed to be the easiest for foreigners. 
 I then found Homebase and it seemed too perfect. But the more I read about them in both English and Vietnamese media, the more they seem legit. Though it's hard to find much reviews from customers that aren't their own promotional material.
 Does anyone know of any experiences with them? Interested hearing both Vietnamese and foreigner experiences.
 If not familiar, they work like: they initially buy the property and own it, then you buy it back from them at a pre-agreed upon price (at any time). You're allowed use the property while buying back.

I was directed to the office but a guy stepped up yo me and offered to get me a pcr test to let me fly for $200. In a panic, i agreed and he did some stuff and got me the test, but the gate was closed. So basically i had to buy a flight ticket to Osaka for a little bit later ($455) because i was told i couldn’t get any refund or transfer for the ticket i had + my visa for Vietnam was over today. I then had to pay the guy 4 mil for the pcr and sprinted to make my flight. In addition, new flight from Osaka Just ran into another guy in Osaka who was at the airport and he said the fake pcr was not only 150 but i could have just paid 1 mil to have my ticket changed until i could get a real pcr test for cheap. I feel like an idiot although i know i was just panicked and wanted nothing more than to make it to Tokyo so I’m out $700 extra dollars.
