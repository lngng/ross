        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a job offer in Thu Dau Mot. There is not a ton of information about this town online, at least in English. I am a little worried about there not being much to do or being able to meet other English speakers and making friends. I am curious if anyone here has any insight. What is life like in Thu Dau Mot? Is there much to do for a foreigner? The only other post asking about TDM is a few years old and I was told the area has seen a lot of growth. Has anything changed?
 About me: I am a male, in my 30's, from the USA, and single. I speak no Vietnamese, although I enjoy learning languages and will attempt to learn basics while living in Vietnam. I don't drink or care too much about having access to crazy nightlife, although I like the option of being able to go out occasionally with people. I enjoy nature, riding my motorcycle around, and doing outdoorsy stuff.
 Thanks!

Unfortunately, I recently found out my mom has cancer and I cancelled all my travel plans since I need to take care of my mom. Last year she tried to get a visa to visit me in California but her visa got denied. What's the best way for her to come visit since I am unable to go anywhere for the time being? Thanks.

 Looking at buying in bau tram ward in long Khánh city. Where would be the best place to find available properties online?
 Not heading back across until November, so I’m trying to get a feel for the market. 
 Looks to be a few on Facebook, but I’m also concerned about the scams / fake ads. 
 Any direction would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I’m an American who’s engaged to a Vietnamese woman and we are living in the US. I noticed pretty early on when she eats she tends to make quite a bit of noise and chews with her mouth open. This is something that kind of drives me insane but I’ve gotten used to it. When I met her parents I noticed her Dad made some interesting noises as well. I did gently tell her once for her own awareness that many Americans consider these things rude or slightly gross, but mostly because I didn’t want her to feel embarrassed if she didn’t know. With things like noodles or soup I can understand to a degree but sometimes it’s almost distracting. Is this just a cultural difference and do Vietnamese people have no problem with it?
 Edit: thank you to all those who provided their thoughts and aren’t so sensitive they somehow took this personally lmao, I appreciate it!

Was there anything you wished was available or anything that was you didn't need or want? It seems like the activities are based on the boat you choose. This is our first time visiting the country and I'm thrilled for the new experience. Any input would be appreciated!

They just bought it a few months ago, and in that time they've sent me home with lots of different homemade dishes; bánh mì, bún thịt nướng chả giò, bún bò Huế, and bánh xèo for starters - all incredibly delicious. They don't want me to pay for it, saying they're just happy someone loves their food. I've increased my tip, but I wasn't sure if etiquette called for something more.

 I am an Irishman in Hue for the four months, and looking for a way to practice bass as I play in a band at home. So far I haven't been able to find either an electric or an acoustic bass in Hue music shops, and I'm wondering if one of you lovely folks could point me in the right direction?
 Am I more likely to find a bass in a pawn shop? Or, if any of you are from Hue, do you have any musician friends who might have seen one for sale?
 Thanks very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full context, I’m a tourist. 
 I’m just wondering what you think it would take to change mindsets about littering?
 Today I was sitting by a small river in Hoi An and there was a tea vendor who came over and tossed two beer cans and a styrofoam package into the water. Not even 7m from him other locals fishing. 
 And I just can’t help but wonder, does he not know that pollution kills potential income and food for his neighbors? Is it education that’s needed?
 Or is it something else?
 And I’m not judging here, I’m honestly curious about why littering is so common in some SE Asian countries. (I had a similar experience while trying to scoop up trash that kids were throwing into a river in Thailand. Which they thought was hilarious for me to do.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m studying in the US and is set to return to Vietnam this June. I wanted to see how dating is like in Vietnam, specifically Hanoi, before officially returning so I got on Bumble and let’s just say I am scarred for life.
 Every guys I have talked to kind of expressed that I was not good-looking to them. I am 5’2 (163 cm), which is said to be average height but most guys told me I would have a difficult time finding a partner in Vietnam bc that’s too tall. One guy said I looked like a random Tiktok man and another said I looked prudish when his goute was “modern women.” I asked what do modern women look like and he said “someone who is stylish and knows how to take care of herself.” He further said since I went to a Western university, I should have adopted their way of dressing up: more revealing clothes and heavy makeup. I told him that here in the US, it is not that common to see students dressing up and have a full-faced makeup every day. Then he kept asking for bikini and croptop pics. Though I don’t wear bikini, I like crop tops so I can send him some, but I declined bc I think it’s rude to ask for these photos because he wants “to have some motivation to tán me”.
 At first, I just want to find someone I can talk to but these interactions really crushed my confidence and made me hyper-aware of my looks. I wouldn’t say I’m ugly and I have never heard that from anyone else. In fact, a lot of people (both Vietnamese and American) called me cute or pretty. My clothes are not out of style at all. I just don’t like too revealing clothes and don’t like wasting time on heavy makeup. I guess the best word you can describe my style is classic Parisian (and occasionally basic hoodies + jeans). I am starting to doubt whether moving back home is a good idea as it feels like I would not fit in at all. 
 Maybe, I guess I just forgot how much Vietnamese cared about vanity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always found it interesting how despite Vietnam having an incredibly close relationship with nature whether that be with their treasured Buffalo’s, Whale worship (Cá Ông) or effective use of Guerrilla Warfare, that it’s currently the 2nd worst rated country when it comes to animal welfare, only beaten by China (https://theswiftest.com/animal-rights-index/). News of Animal Cruelty seems to be consistently coming out of Vietnam from dead whales washing up on shore in their droves without being investigated (https://globalvoices.org/2016/06/07/tons-of-fish-are-dying-mysteriously-in-vietnam-whales-too/amp/) to tiger/bear bile farms that operate despite prohibition (https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/news/hanoi-last-race-end-bear-bile-farming-vietnam-urgent-action-needed). This topic is interesting enough to me that I’ve been conceptualising a potential documentary on the subject and was wondering why people think it even got to this point? Globalisation? Influence from China? Simple lack of legislation or awareness? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with the topic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry in advance, if this is the wrong subreddit to post this here, as I could not find any Vietnam History specific sub-reddit.
 Hi everyone!! I am Pranjal(Male from India). I am highly interested in urban history-seeing how urban spaces originate and grow. Hanoi was of particular interest to me as it possibly is the continuously inhabited oldest city in SEA(from time of Dongson Culture- Co Loa). 
 I have spent the past month charting out the history in Hanoi from Co Loa, Northern Domination, Thang Long, French Colonization, Socialist era and post Doi Moi era(till around 2018) going into as much detail as possible. I just landed in Hanoi yesterday and plan to be here for a week. As part of my (amateurish) research, wanted a perspective from a Hanoi local as well who has an interest/knowledge regarding Hanoi's history(especially regarding the architectural history). In return for the help, more than happy to share my knowledge regarding history, bear any transportation/food costs, even cook some Indian food for you :) etc 
 Also if in case you have reference of some paid historical service/tour group which can give me an holistic overview of Hanoi from Co Loa to present( I couldn't find any), that will be great as well. 
 Thanks in advance for the help :) 
 The sources that I have used so far-
 1. Hanoi: Biography of a City - William Stewart Logan
 2. Vietnamese Architecture - Le Phuoc
 3. Van Horen, B. (2005). City profile Hanoi. Cities, 22(2), 161–173.
 4. The new Hanoi: Opportunities and challenges for future urban development- Divya Leducqa, Helga-Jane Scarwellb
 5. The origins of Ancient Vietnam- Nam C. Kim

 https://i.imgur.com/00jQDgE.jpg
 Most often, these are written like a fraction, so: 850 kg / 5N. 
 As an engineer, I got used to units and my 1st thought was: kilogram (kg) per Newton (N) does not make any sense. They are both related via F = ma, so why divide them? And it's not like the division will yield "a" which is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. 
 Anyway, I found out today after speaking with a trucker: N means Người aka passenger 🤣 So it lists the max no. of passenger you are allowed in the truck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, me and my partner are travelling from the UK to Vietnam next week (for 14 days). We are taking over with us 30 million VND in cash and have recently seen we need to declare this as it's over 15 million (conflicting information on Gov.uk website). How do we do this? Is it done when we arrive in Vietnam? On the plane? Before we go?? 
 Our airline (bamboo airways) unfortunately hasn't been any help and their correspondence tells us to ask the UK Government. 
 Thankyou for any help!

 And I also see that conscription Is a big part of the military, with male citizens joining the military for 2 years. But my question is, does the conscription system work for Vietnam ? It appear to me that Vietnam use the Soviet model for conscription. With field formations consisting of masses of infantryman, as a result of such a large number of soliders; the training, tactics, communication of those units are simplified. 
 And with most cases, when a person complete his 2 years tour, he goes home, meaning that anyone who replace him, need to be train again. Large amount of money are used to train and retrain unit…]]></summary>

 I am a Swede with half Vietnamese blood. I have lived in Sweden since I was a child and sometimes return to Vietnam after getting married. About 2 years ago, also in April, I was stuck in Vietnam due to the outbreak of COVID. I was surprised to see that the media in Vietnam often publishes positive news about the local epidemic situation but spread the opposite news about other countries, especially the West and the US. I remember they said that American people have no food and students have to eat leftovers. When I asked my wife (100% Vietnamese and her family lives there), she said it's normal with TV stations there. Then, when the nightmares of the epidemic passed and we returned to Sweden, we kept receiving calls from her family in Vietnam, asking if we were okay and hungry because television often broadcast news about the bad situation. like Europe is about to enter the stone age —a food crisis, a gas crisis, that sort of thing. And most recently, when we planned to join a tour, which included a visit to the West Coast of the US, there were calls from her family again, like, be careful of the shootings!
 But yesterday, when my wife showed me this statistic, I just... I wondered what was going on. After the wars, why do Vietnamese people have such warm affection for America?

 I am going travelling around SE Asia for a couple of months but I am worried about travelling with my ADHD medication. I am unsure of the legality of Elvanse in Vietnam as it is an amphetamine based stimulant, so I was considering switching medication to Concerta (methylphenidate) and bringing in a 2 months supply with a doctors note.
 This is not ideal but it will keep me going. 
 I have tried calling the Vietnamese embassy but I am sent straight to an answer machine with no option to speak to a human and I have tried to book an appointment but they are jam packed until July 😬 
 If anyone could shed any light on the legality of both Elvanse and Concerta in Vietnam I would be incredibly grateful. First hand experience is great too but it would be amazing if someone had some solid legal advice with a link or something. Just to put my mind at ease 😎 
 Also, I’m sorry if this question isn’t permitted on this sub - just remove it.
 Thank you 😊

 Are there any agencies or companies similar to https://www.supportshepherd.com/ that could help us find and vet candidates for us to hire? They are based in the Philippines, but as I'm a VK, I would prefer to hire from Vietnam if possible. 
 Thank you!

That exams today are very important but i blanked the answer papers in history and geography, but i did finish the literature paper. I know i am rlly a bad student, i once didnt have so many friends in primary and middle school, they once isolated me so i used to try to cut off online connection with them to study more concentrate, in grade 8 my schl used to end at 11:45 am and then i just went home nap til 2 pm and then woke up and start to do hws til 5 pm, then just another break and start w hws again at 7pm and stayed up very late until 3 or 4 am. But my marks didnt get better, it was still low like 4 or 5, and then my classmate at middle school started to bully me like “why you so dumb but u still going to school” “why dont you stay home and do an deadend job(minimum wage job) in the future” “you are humiliating ur parents”, even the teachers humiliated me. It didnt change since i moved to highschool, i cannot change but i ask my parents to move to college or just study for some job thats ez but they want me to study uni. My life is such a mess when i am born in this world

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got this vietnamese gourd from my partners mom. She told me to keep it on the windowsill until it's warm enough to plant it outside and to keep the dirt moist. I did as she told me and the plant did well the first couple of days but now it's starting to wilt and the leaves changed colors, got paler. She also has no idea what I did wrong. I didn't find any help on any other forum so I wanted to ask here, maybe someone has more experience with this plant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm asking this with utmost respect and hope I'm not offending anyone! I'm writing a play including a male Vietnamese character, and I don't want to pull a JK Rowling, so I wanted to ask actual Vietnamese people if that name makes sense and could be used.
 Yen Hao is supposed to be the first and middle name, Dong the surname. I know that with Vietnamese names, the surname usually comes first. But my play takes place in Czech Republic, and from what I've seen, Vietnamese people around here usually use the Czech order of names (so given name(s) first, surname second).
 If the name is incorrect, I'd be very glad to hear alternatives! He's based on the character of Yevgeni Dorn from Chekov's Seagull, so I'm looking for a name that sounds vaguely similar, although it's in a different language. Thanks for any help:)

I was kind of surprise hearing this, I also asked my friend living in Canada and he confirmed the similar thing. They all agreed that it was boring to live there. But for me, I feel sad for Vietnamese people who has to get up early to work or stay late to work too. I said to my friends, we are poorer so we spent all time in a day to work. They close shop at night and on weekend so they have quality time for them and they are not really obsessed of making money. What are your opinions on this, from outside and inside VN people?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I have been in Vietnam for a week. Since getting here, my phone has gone from working essentially the same as back home (The US) to dying more quickly than charging when plugged in (it only actually charges with the phone turned off), and dying very quickly when not off the charger. When put into airplane mode and with no wifi connected it seems to deplete more slowly. 
 These are my guesses as to what is going on:
 a) the combination of charger box and charger cord I have are weak, I should try and find a stronger cord
 b) I am using Verizon's international plan and don't have a SIM card yet, so having my cell service and mobile data turned on is killing my phone. 
 I will go out and buy a stronger charger today and likely be getting my SIM installed either today or tomorrow. 
 Are there any other problems that could be happening based on anyone's experience that I could be missing? It's starting to make things quite challenging so I'd love any ideas as to how to help!

 I am curious about how buying property in VN works? I am a British Born Vietnamese with the possibility to get a VN passport as my parents were born there. I am hoping to one day relocate to VN and was wondering how the process works?
 If anyone has any experience purchasing as an expat I'd love to know more about the process and it would be highly appreciated!

Trúng gió - for example perplexed me for years.. usually they relate this to family members getting sick from being outside or exposed to wind. From my understanding, it is the western equivalent to catching a cold. Maybe for older folk who have health conditions should be worried, but people are outside in wind all the time, yet it's spoken about like a death knell waiting to happen to you. NEVERMIND the fact that taking walks outside in the sun, getting breath of fresh air is literally the best thing for you. I've heard an additional explanation from a Vietnamese is that a sudden gust of wind could cause a stroke, temperature imbalance, or just shock in some way. Possible? Sure. B…]]></summary>

 In all that time I've also been approached only once by someone who was asking for money (we'd call it begging where I'm from.). 
 What's the deal? Is it tight familial structures that keep people from being homeless or is it the state taking care of them.

Initially I planned to come here around eastern, so the beginning of April, but due to projects at works I needed to postpone my stay by 3 weeks.
 Now I arrived in Hanoi and it’s extremely cloudy / gray and the locals told me that this is the weather I need to expect for the next 2 weeks.
 I was wondering if I should fly down to hoe chi minh and then travel up to da nang.. cause that’s where my flight starts to Cambodia (my next stop)

I love sunny days no matter the temperature and I've looked at the forecast multiple times to see "sunny". But not once has there been any blue sky. Is this smog or something else?
 Also I'm in Sapa at the moment and cannot see the mountainous backdrop due to this haze which is very disappointing.

Everything seems far from the Vietnamese culture. I am also shocked by so much money spent when Phu Quoc clearly suffers from a lack of hygiene and waste management. But I may be influenced by my European culture, so I would like to have your opinion on the matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been seeing the username or in-game name "DoCoCauBai" popping up all over the place since like 2012 on job forums, in user IDs for games, and even as a nickname for sports competitions. But I have no idea what it means or where it comes from? From what I translated its land owned by Uncle 7?
 I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this for me. Does anyone know the origins of this username/nickname? Is it a reference to something specific or just a made-up name? Any information would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chao Anh and Ems, Im a Viet born in Sweden in the early nineties. Probably one of the most foreign subgroup of VN people and if you ever meet one you know we are weird af, hopefully always in a good way tho. People say I dont even look Viet (In Vietnam) , but I know I'm at least 4 Nguyens generations deep and Ive been visiting my great great grandfathers tombs out there in the jungle, so I should qualify!
 But as far as Vietnamese people and culture go we are useless! We understand Vietnamese in a weird way like only spoken Vietnamese and it should be in a specific context like when you are angry af, it's very selective. And it helps if you sound like my parents, if you have different dialect then sorry không hiểu gì hết!
 I have decided to change that and start hiểu that part of me, Ive been visiting Vietnam (mainly HCM), for a few weeks at the time, for a couple of years now. And guess what my language improved a little bit! This last year Ive visited more than 12 weeks, and the idea of relocating doesn't seem too crazy to me anymore, and actually at this stage of my life kinda makes sense, its a great challenge for me personally, and I honestly feel a little bit bored and in some ways limited here in Sweden.
 So whats my problem, just move!? Well If could just move I would but I need to find qualified work first. Im a software engineer working full-stack with a couple of years experience. Im already looking at some standard stuff that might fit me through regular channels e.g. linkedIn, and I will keep looking there. But its a jungle out there, for a guy who doesn't know the job market over there it all could be a hit or miss. 
 Hopefully somebody here has been in a similar situation and can share their experience or have any good insights, or even better set me up! Help a brother from another mother come home!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a couple in our mid-thirties planning a move to Vietnam this September, and would love your opinions on which city would suit us best. We love food, culture, music and easy access to nature/green spaces (inside and outside town) above all. Our party days are not over, but we gravitate more towards conviviality than blind drunkenness, and would love to create connections with locals and not just foreigners :) 
 Pros and cons of both cities in relation to the above?
 Thanks in advance!

 We walked around a corner near the lake in Hanoi to see a group of people shouting and frantically unloading these giant fish (I think they were carp) out of the back of a motorbike. There was a lot of flailing arms, flailing fish, commotion etc as they quickly grabbed and tossed all of the fish into the lake. Some of the fish were massive, so slippery that they were dropped onto the floor and ushered into the water by land.
 A security guard then blew his whistle and they all quickly started praying/meditating, before jumping on their bikes and riding away.
 It was pretty fascinating to watch and our best guess was that it's related to a buddhist fish ceremony. 
 Are we correct and does it happen a lot at Hoan Kiem lake? Where do they likely get the fish from if so?
 Thanks!

 I just wanted to ask if anyone here has used the Wise (formerly Transferwise) travel card in the country as a tourist? I currently live in Japan and plan to convert some money to put onto it but I’m worried about being able to use it to withdraw cash at local ATMs (as it’s my first time visiting the country and I hear most places will only take cash).
 I heard Agribank has the lowest fees (and a reasonably generous daily limit on withdrawals) so I was considering trying to use the Wise card to withdraw cash from their ATMs. Does anyone know if this will work? 
 TIA!

 I did not get a Sim at the airport because of a post I had read earlier about someone having problems with there sim. 
 Instead I used the airports Wi-Fi to order a grab and then walked to a viettel dealer the next day which allowed me to explore the neighborhood. ( don’t forget to bring your passport 😬)
 I got a 30 day prepaid plan with voice and 4G LTE data for 170,000 VND which is 7.24 USD I have no idea how many gigs I get but I use it to FaceTime my friends and parents and listen to Spotify. Might hotspot if I get this online teaching gig but I’ll keep my 🤞. Anyways…
 (This doesn’t include the 60,000 VND it cost for the grab rides to and from the Viettel store because I had forgotten my passport at the hotel. 😂)
 I did walk a total of 4 miles that day and felt pretty amazing afterwards so it was worth it 🙃🥳
 I look forward to the weekend and exploring District 1. So far the people here have been awesome and I really feel welcomed!

what are the typical housing system there?

 environmental advantages and dis advantages 
 what if i was to reconstruct those family's near a flowing water supply like river/ canal...would it be possible or logical?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello people of r/Vietnam!
 I'm travelling to HCMC next month and looking for local music venus where they invite indie, alternative, rock or techno musicians. I only recently found out the hidden gems thanks to Saigon Supersound.
 I could find some conventional clubs or bars but they don't seem to care much about music but only attract thousands of uninteresting tourists.
 Any insider's information about clubs, cafes, bars, concerts or music festivals are much welcomed. If you know communities, websites or magazines that'll be also awesome!
 I'd appreciate your recommendation or tips on how to explore the local underground music scene.
 Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been traveling for a year and just spent 2.5 months in India, and I have been lucky to not experience anything like this. 
 It’s 9am and I’m biking through the rice fields in Hoi An. A scooter drives past me and stops ahead about 10 meters. The guy gets off and heads to the side of the road. I know what this is cause I have ridden by men peeing a couple times now. 
 But this time was different. He was turned towards me at 45° angle and holding his erect junk in his hands. His face was turned towards me. I gasped and looked away and then covered my face and eyes as I rode past him. Luckily I don’t think he followed me. 
 Wtf!???? Is this common???

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asking here because I suppose some foreigners in this chat would know some good rental places. I'm a local from Saigon, looking to rent a quality bike for some road trip riding. Preferably something like the Exciter or Winner because I'll be riding into the mountains in Central highlands.
 Rental duration probably 3 weeks or so. But mainly, I'm hoping to find somewhere that can offer a bit of flexibility, because you never know what happens on a road trip. A plus point would be towing/recovery insurance just in case.

 This summer my friend and I are traveling to Hanoi for three days. I have been doing a lot of research and scouring this subreddit looking for help with things to do. I know three days is not a lot of time but I am torn about whether a trip to Ha Long Bay is worth it. It looks absolutely stunning but I know it is a hike to get there from Old Quarter of Hanoi. Was wondering for people who have been to Hanoi -- is two days sufficient to see the main sights? or given our limited time the day trip to Ha Long isn't worth it? Would appreciate any insight from people who have been. Thank you and looking forward to my trip!

 Long story short I am Australian and my dad (54M) started dating a Vietnamese woman (37F) right before Covid. How they met I believe was through an ex of his who was also Vietnamese. My dad went overseas a few times in 2019/2020 to visit her before Covid hit and the obviously couldn’t travel again. Then in late 2022 he moved the woman and her kid here into the family home despite myself and brother having never met them 
 I am aware he was sending her money while she was overseas and since they have arrived in Australia money is a big source of argument. I believe he is still sending money to her family and that his wife still has a Vietnamese bank account and has asked for his password to his bank account. She has brought up multiple times to me that she had looked to live elsewhere in Australia or go back to Vietnam once the date is up that they meet their visa requirements 
 This all seems very concerning to me but I’m interested to hear from the Vietnamese community if this is normal or if she is just using my dad for a visa and is going to leave?
 *Forgot to add they legally got married in Australia in February 2023. Did the fake wedding in Vietnam in 2022 which was to appease family apparently. My brother and I weren’t invited or asked to attend but then randomly two days before got asked write a speech for this woman we had never never met…

 I want to get a electricity regulator but wife keeps saying not to. Main reason is she says electricity will be much more expensive. I ask her how much more but she isn't able to say.
 Does anyone know? So the reasoning is that let's say you use 1 million a month usually, with the regulator, it will make the electricity proper voltage so using more electricity even though your using the same.
 How much of an increase do you think that will be?

 This isn't a shit post or post to vent but more so a question of if it gets better or not.
 Im sure the bright eye bushy tail newbies will have something to say but I'm looking for advice from expats that have been here for 5 years or longer.

 Edit: So I waited untill 01:30 before waking him up. The guy was a heavy sleeper, I had to make so much noise. He got up, apologized and gave me my laundry back - it was right under the counter, I could have just grabbed it 😭

 I'm travelling to Vietnam later this year and wanted to take my medication with me. The issue is that it requires a prescription which I dont have since I got it over the counter from a different country (but it is prescription only in my current country and cant be bought in Vietnam). 
 The medication is not an addictive/abusive or psychedelic substance (so no opioids and not a adhd/anxienty/depression medication or whatever), and Im only planning to take what I need with me, so no massive quantities either.
 Would I end up having any troubles taking it to Vietnam? Im not so worried if it gets confiscated, just dont want to end up in prison or anything. Thank you in advance!

But I hear the border agents may start asking you questions if you bring a lot of electronics. I was planning to bring my work computer, personal computer, Nintendo Switch and possibly my DSLR. What do you think of this? Some friends are telling me to leave the DLSR and personal computer at home and some suggest my iPad instead of my personal computer so I'm not traveling with two computers. Any advice on this? I just prefer my personal computer for ease of use, multiple tabs, search history and research. I know I can do it all on my phone and iPad too. Also, how dangerous is it to bring your DSLR when visiting tourists areas? I know many photographers do it but I don't want to lose anything on the trip or be a target for theft of course.
 ​
 Just any advice or personal opinions/experiences would be great.

 Luckily no major injuries, although I had to spend the whole morning getting checked and got some decent cuts on my feet (I guess sandals aren't the way to go).
 It was a hit an run and the police already found footage of the car that hit me. But it's all so avoidable if people just slow down. Also people on bikes need to learn how to use their signals because the car today just completely ignored mine. 
 Anyway, stay safe on the roads. I was as safe as I could've been and it still didn't matter. I guess that's the gamble you take every single day! 🎉

 I suffer from occasional panic attacks and sporadic moments of severe anxiety and I'm prescribed Alprazolam for this. 
 I have been travelling for a few months and my small supply has run out so I'm looking to buy a new box. 
 Has anyone got a good address where they don't sell the fake stuff? Could be another brand as long as it is legit and not some weird concoction. 
 Before I left my doctor gave me a paper explaining that I need to take this medicine, but I don't have a prescription for more at this present time. Does the paper (signed by the doctor) indicating that I am allowed to take this medicine as needed suffice to get it? 
 Also any idea on prices? 
 Thank you all for taking the time to answer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think it’s just so common as a Viet living abroad that random people shouting out Nihao or ching-chong all just straight up asking : Are you Chinese? Are you Korean? You look Chinese … etc. While in Vietnam, if we see a white person and we want to know where they’re from, we respectfully ask: Where are you from? We did not just straight up calling them French, Canadian or some nationality. We just referred to them as ”Tây” = Westerner; or “Người nước ngoài” = People from outer countries. If you’re back people will say you black. If you’re white people say you’re white. But when your EA or SEA or random Asian they say ‘Chinese’??? 
 Asia is so diverse, there are Laos, Mongolia, Malaysia, etc. :) Especially Vietnam has a painful history fighting back from China and suffers from cultures destruction and assimilation by Chinese, the feeling is worse. 
 I wish one day everyone can be more acknowledged of racial diversity in Asia and ask them more general question like : “Which part of Asian are you from? What’s your ethnicity?” Instead of labeling people with something that we are not sure of.

My family is hiding that news from her, and I don’t feel good about it. I mean I understand their intentions of not telling my grandma that she has cancer for her mental health, etc. But it feels extra wrong because they lied to her and said that her tumor was benign. I feel like it’s fair to share the news when the time is right, so she can maybe live life a bit differently. 
 Maybe I’m just Vietnamese-American and I just don’t understand the culture. Can someone give me more perspective and understanding to this difficult situation?

 I will be playing the usual global charts English music but I think it would also be good to infuse some popular Chinese or Vietnamese songs that the couple and their families might enjoy dancing to!
 Of course I tried looking at charts on Spotify etc but I think it would be more valuable to have suggestions from native people!
 Please recommend me some songs that I can play at the wedding party.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! Today I would like to discuss some tech and apps that can improve our daily routines. There are many apps and services that already make life easier in other countries. Some countries have completely automated and digitized everyday life. For example, there are apps that help with logistics such as scheduling appointments or managing deliveries; grocery delivery apps; payment apps that make transactions quicker and more secure. Doctor's appointments, accounting services, freelance work - the list goes on. And it is not necessarily something complicated and expensive, some services are convenient and popular, although behind them is a small development team.
 So, please share the apps and services that you're excited to try. Share your experiences and opinions, and feel free to elaborate on any particular features or benefits that you found most useful. Thank you for your input!
 Who knows, maybe it will come to life soon)

I was wondering if anyone else who is an expat currently lives in Ha Giang and could offer me some advice on how to find a place to live.
 I also have some concerns about moving to a smaller city, as I currently live in Hanoi. While I am drawn to the cooler climate and natural beauty of Ha Giang, I worry about the potential challenges of living in a smaller city with fewer amenities and opportunities.
 If anyone has made a similar transition from a larger city to a smaller one in Vietnam, I would love to hear about your experience and any advice you may have. How did you adjust to the change in pace and lifestyle? What were some unexpected challenges or benefits of living in a smaller city?
 Thank you in advance for your help and insights.

 What i dont need is: bars, partying, tourist sites, etc
 What i like is: lots of walking along mom and pop shops, eating in local food shops, popping in for a foot massage from time to time.
 Are there pedestrian friendly neighborhoods that you like or would recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Went inside to test ride a small training bike for my 5 year old. Going on the first test ride, I noticed that the tires were nearly flat deflated. Obviously my kid struggled to ride it well.
 On the return around, I asked why is the tire deflated? Can you inflate the tire so we can have a better test?
 Their smart answer was, "It comes from the factory like that. If you want us to inflate it, you'll have to buy it first."
 Completely ridiculous. Mind you we are still evaluating and testing the product, and you want us to make a buying decision while the product is unusable? After that conversation, I noticed the handle bar was completely loose. Figures as much why my son struggle to turn the bike. I put the bike back to find another bike. The 2nd bike I found also had a handle bar that was also completely loose from the front wheel. Someone assembling the product in their department needs to be evaluated.
 Why on earth do you setup a display of bikes that are unprepared for test ride for children? Why is your smart response are that the bikes "come from the factory like that" an appropriate answer for deflated tires? And why do you expect people to buy it from you while they can't even get normal working conditions to evaluate the quality of a product?
 I didnt expect this type of low end service behavior from buying at a department store, at a big mall no less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question is not just for vietjetair, it helps me if you have the same issue with any other form in Viet Nam. :)
 I am a foreigner in Vietnam, when I buy a flight on Vietnam Airlines I have no problems because the website is well developed, but when I buy it on vietjetair, the website does not allow more than 25 characters in the given name and last name fields. I have a very long European given and last name and it doesn't fit on the form.
 I always have to shorten it and that causes me a lot of problems at the airport because while passing control they stop me saying the name in the ticket is no the same name shown in the passport, I always waste time explaining to the staff that my name doesn't fit on the form when I buy the ticket through the Web. Many times I have to wait until manager comes and tell me is ok after check my passport and explain again the issue and once I almost miss flight because they made me wait too long.
 I have contacted the company and they do not give me any solution. Anyone with the same problem?
 Thank you.

 I'm having an incredibly difficult time finding things like nicotine patches, nasal sprays, lozenges, etc.
 All I can find is a product called Oh No from Long Chau pharmacy. 
 These small little bottles of lozenges really aren't doing the trick for me. They are expensive and the bottles run out very quickly. 
 Has anybody else had success with finding a decent product around here?
 Even smokeless tobacco seems impossible to find. 
 I'm feeling desperate.

For instance, a recent video showing a policeman kicking a teenage boy while holding a gun has sparked a surprisingly positive response from some Vietnamese netizens.
 In the video, the policeman can be seen kicking the teen who is already sitting on the ground with a gun pointed at him. However, instead of outrage, some netizens have applauded the officer's actions, with comments such as "Very good beating," "Always support the police," and "I fully support the police officers like this."

 I plan to rent a motorcycle, but I'm scared of being stopped by officers on the road. I have license, but I'm from a different country.
 ​
 Question is:
 - How to get there if I'm not going to use a rented motorcycle?
 - Is it safe to just go there using a rented motorcycle?
 - Should I book from taxi mobile application? 
 - Is commute an easy way?
 ​
 Thank you so much, Peeps!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning to arrive in HCMC tomorrow for 2 weeks with additional week in Da Nang. Seek your quick advice:
  
SIM Card?: I have been suggested its better to not buy at the airport. Plan is to get a Grab to my hotel, check in, and then find some shop for SIM Card. However, can you recommend which SIM Card/company is better? (Just want reliable internet/data)
 
Where to exchange currency?: While airport is a no go (will exchange just enough for taxi and check in), curious if there're any specific places with great exchange rates? (Eg. SuperRich in Bangkok is known for its highly competitive exchange rate). 
 
 Or Is it feasible to withdraw money from the ATM? (Again, eg. in Bangkok, you are charged 220 THB right away for every ATM withdrawal so unless you're withdrawing chunk of cash, its just dropping money on avoidable)
  
Worth it to drive moped/bike to get around? For reference, I have driven in South Asia so I am quite used to...uh, interesting drivers.

 Ive read about motes, not sure i can use it/make one that isnt too high. My cats are small still so they may not reach or knock it over trying to get high enough.
 I figured maybe someone in VN has the same problem and found a good way to stop, or bought something?

 So some background information. I'm an American who got a B.S. Electrical Engineering degree back in 2016. After school I ended up hating electrical engineering and took a job working in media out of college, but I hated that too. Then in early 2020 I switched careers to IT and got a bunch of basic IT certifications. I have been working as IT support for the last 3 years. I am by no means an IT expert, but I at least have some idea of what I'm doing.

 I set my phone as lost on ‘Find My iPhone’ with the following message Chiếc iphone này bị bỏ lại sau khi nhặt, vui lòng gọi (dads phone number here) để trả lại càng sớm càng tốt hoặc chuyển đến Fusion Suites Sài Gòn or WhatsApp (my phone number here, as I have WhatsApp on this phone instead of my personal)
 The best part is that as soon as I did that the driver did actually call my dad but unfortunately due to language constraints between the two they weren’t able to communicate effectively. 
 What’s frustrating though is that since then I have tried to call my phone multiple times and the driver has refused to pick up. 
 I have tried reaching out to grab via their helpline but the phone line keeps getting disconnected. I am also unable to sign into my grab account on this second phone as I need Facebook 2FA and the code generator is on my personal phone. 
 Just looking for advice, support, next steps or others who have faced something similar I guess. 
 I’m worried that the phone will eventually die and I will no longer be able to track it and then all hope is lost lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey so I really need some advice, I’m currently in the USA I am a social worker, attempting to work with a Vietnamese family.
 Already there is a language barrier they speak very little English and when I try to use a translator it seems to upset them and they try to communicate with me in small phrases but obviously I lose meaning of what they try to say and they lose meaning of what I try to say.
 So far he has gotten mad at me twice, one for walking upstairs wit my shoes on and another by attempting to contact his wife without going through him.
 At this point I think I’m just culturally missing some elements that he is starting to take as disrespect, I have to talk to them again at their house in a few days and I’m not trying to get cursed out again in Vietnamese pls help.

 How do you respond in Vietnamese when you get compliments appearance wise?
 I'm half Chinese and half Vietnamese living in Europe. In China you don't really say thank you. You just downplay it or deny it playfully.
 I grew up ugly so I never had this encounter but now as an adult I have gotten couple compliments. I just don't know how to answer other than giggling and shaking my head. Thank you for the help. ❤️

 I am visiting HCMC in early June, partially as a vacation but partially to learn more about the local scene for entrepreneurs and freelancers. I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I'm strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.
 As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I'm not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.
 Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats? Anyone here running their own small business or online business in Vietnam and would like to meet for a coffee or beer?
 Thanks for reading!

 I am currently travelling around Vietnam with my girlfriend and we are in Ninh Binh where it is raining today tomorrow with some thunderstorms(apparently) and I am just wondering what are common indoor activities or that when it is raining so much?
 Is it similar to other countries like bowling/cinema in bigger cities or is there some more localised activities?
 If anyone has any suggestions for Ninh Binh I'd be very thankful but it just made me think about everywhere else around the country too.

 I have almost 2 years internship experience with multinational corporations on top of my degree. I’m mostly interested in positions involving cloud, DevOps, networking and operating systems, rather than full time software development. 
 How easy would it be for a non Vietnamese graduate to find an entry level position? What would a reasonable monthly wage be? I’ve seen positions ranging from $900-2500, and was wondering what an acceptable range for negotiation would be. Lastly, are there any specific websites I can look for jobs? I’ve currently just been using LinkedIn, Glassdoor and indeed. 
 Thank you in advance for your help 🙏

 Randomly during the day my service will completely stop working. It’ll last for hours before it starts again. I’ve turned off my VPN, restarted my phone, turned on/off airplane mode. Nothing works. 
 Is this common and how do I fix it?

 I recently came across a painting, which I believe is the work of a talented Vietnamese artist. However, the signature on the artwork is a bit tricky to read, and I'm struggling to identify who the artist might be. That's where your expertise comes in! 😄
 Here's the signature:

I told the driver my hotel name and he started driving and then takes me to like four different hotels and each time I say this is not my hotel.
 Finally he asks to use my phone for google maps and I hate handing my phone over but was tired and starting to feel sick. I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn't hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.
 He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn't) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn't even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.
 POLICE are zero help because I don't remember the drivers cab number. Is there ANYTHING I can do? My phone is not showing on the findmyiphone app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I often get these friend requests from attractive looking Vietnamese female profiles on Facebook. Sometimes they are from Vietnam and sometimes they are in the US. They would chat with me and reveal their scam by trying to get me to sell random stuffs for them on some scam sites that give them commissions. I think they themselves believe that those scam sale sites are legit. 
 Another scam is they say they trade options to make money on the side and can help me make money, I never let it go further than that so I don’t know exactly how they do it. However, 90% of them would just chat and talk to me for weeks and months. I entertain them and keep talking to them to see what the scam is but it never comes. I talk to them like a normal respectful person but never show them that I am thirsty. Eventually they just stop talking to me. 
 The one thing in common I noticed is that they would edit old photo posts from months and years ago. Why do this? Is it their way of establishing that the profile is legit because they have posts from years ago? Is there ever a legit reason for someone to edit photos from a couple years ago? I am just trying to understand what is it they want from me or what kind of scam it is because it is a lot of time and efforts they go through. Thank you guys.

 I am always very careful when inputting the pickup address and drop a pin exactly where I am on the map. But when I go to find them I am walking up and down the street and can't see them.
 I have a 4G sim. Am I doing something wrong or is the app location a bit off sometimes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hoping this is the right place to ask - I'm looking for a European based Vietnamese teacher to help me improve my Vietnamese. I lived in Hanoi for a couple of years where my learning was very minimal and since moving back to Europe, I would like to improve my level. 
 I take online lessons but the time zones make it a bit difficult with a teacher based in Vietnam, so it limits my lessons to an hour a week.
 If anyone here knows anyone that would be able to help me, or point me in the right direction, that'd be perfect. They don't need to be a qualified teacher, just someone who I could practice with, and is able to explain about the grammar/pronunciations aspects.
 Thanks in advance!

 Did I create a false memory in my head or something? It's driving me crazy!
 I've been in Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An and Da Lat if that helps. Is it a regional thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I LOVE Vietnamese food and have been indulging in every dish I can find. However, both me and my gf noticed we have extremely smaller appetites here as compared to home (USA).
 I suppose I've been doing slightly less excercisey things (i.e no lifting weights) but we still walk probably a couple miles a day. Plus, I feel like I can go into bottomless pit mode at home when I'm just being a couch potato. 
 Anyone else experience this? For the record, I eat a relatively healthy diet back in the states so I dont think it's due to me consuming less processed foods.

 However, when looking at the weather forecast for august it says there could be monsoons and very heavy rain. Is this still doable or would it be cloudy and raining for most of the day? 
 Other suggestions are also really appreciated!
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the report by Vietnam Ministry of Health, as of April 10, 2023, there has been a sudden increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country, and Hanoi is currently leading in the number of new cases. 
 There has been a significant increase in the number of Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals, and many of them require oxygen support, especially the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.
 So, should we worry about the new wave of Covid-19?

 I was confused because I always considered it a sort of Pride specially because here in south America as the history of Vietnam has always been a inspiration for us. 
 I'm also quite embarrassed, I have a friend from Vietnam and I've been using this term for a while, well this friend never said anything against it, this is what makes me even more confused.

 Hoping to get recommendations for hospital and costs as well as actual recovery time and follow up appointments.
 As a solo traveller is the recovery something that you can get through on your own? Is it as simple as having a hotel to stay at for the following night and arranging a lift from the hospital back to the hotel?
 What about follow up appointments, I'm not overly keen on staying in HCMC for too long. How about heading to Danang the following day and checking back in at HCMC on the way back to flying out? Were you able to swim and ride a motorbike after the procedure? I think swimming is not recommended. Just wondering what to do in recovery I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have a question about buying a DJI mini 3 pro with the RC and Fly more kit plus in Vietnam. I'll be visiting the country in about a month and I'm wondering how much it would cost to buy this product in a local store. Unfortunately, I cannot order it from the official DJI site because I'll be moving around a lot.
 Can anyone recommend the best stores to go to for purchasing this drone in Vietnam? Also, I'm a bit concerned about the legality of flying drones in Vietnam. What happens if the police catch you with a drone? Is it illegal to fly drones in certain areas of the country?
 Thank you for your help and advice in advance. I'm really looking forward to my trip to Vietnam and I'd love to capture some amazing footage with my new drone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 My fiancée and I are planning to take a trip out to Nha Ttrang in September/October. My company does not give me much vacation time - only 3 weeks a year - so for this trip, I am only looking to spend about 7-ish days in VietNam, with a few of them specifically in Nha Trang.
 I make a fairly good income at my job - just shy over $100K USD - and I'm not reluctant to spend $130-$180 a night at a nice hotel with my fiancée. Unfortunately we are in the process of waiting for a Visa, so do not see one another that frequently. My fiancée doesn't care too much about fancy accommodations since she grew up fairly frugal, but I don't mind spending the extra $$ because I'm a little spoiled.
 Anyways, what is everyone's favourite luxury hotel in Nha Trang? We we will be taking a flight from HCM. The 40-50min drive from the airport isn't a deal breaker, so the hotel does not necessarily need to be in a convenient in-between location from airport and the night market.
 We've looked up a few spots already; Queen Ann, Ariyana SmartCondotel, and Panorama by HLG.
 The biggest thing I'm looking for is a comfortably-sized shower for additional intimacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to hear thoughts of those outside of western worlds.
 Australia getting pretty grim with high interest rates and corporate owned houses for renting, rich boomer generation buying multiple houses to rent out and rich overseas investors buying 5+ houses to rent out. A lot more homeless around nowadays. 
 But our salaries are alright, even a waiter can afford a house if we save good for 3-5 years, we could probably get a mortgage that will take a life time to pay off.
 I went over to vietnam and found out that salaries can be 250k to 500k VND, depending on location. But the property prices are equivalent to USA and Aus. 
 Not everyone will have corporate jobs or be in a financial situation to afford these prices.
 How is it looking for those who are starting from scratch? No family to assist, just a normal everyday job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 After searching the subreddit, I've seen several questions about short layovers in HCMC (5-6 hours max). Most of the consensus I've read is that Tan Son Nhat makes that short of a stopover risky, and best to stay in the airport. However, in June I'll be flying in on my way back to Australia and I'll have 10 hours of stopover time from landing to the next departure.
 I already went ahead and got a visa, so that should speed things up. If I factor in 30 min to 1 hour for customs, another 30 minutes or so into the city centre via taxi, and then 30 min to get back to the airport 3 whole hours before my international departure, that still leaves me with potentially 5 hours in HCMC. Worth it in my book! I never thought I'd get to set foot in Vietnam so I'm excited to take the opportunity.
 Where's the best area to wander for 5-ish hours in HCMC? Try some local Vietnamese dishes, get a bit of a sense of what the city is like, any quick interesting sights, etc. I'll be there on a Friday if that makes a difference for any markets or things that will be open.
 Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was the 3rd Mongol invasion of Vietnam, along the Bạch Đằng river. The Viets positioned themselves in small flotilla along the river, and made a false retreat drawing the Mongol fleet into the trap.With the Yuan fleet trapped, the Vietnamese junks armed with bombs, attacked them from all sides. Many of the Mongols jumped into the river to save themselves were killed or drowned. The Viet captured around 400 Yuan warships.
 This victory effectively put an end to the Mongol invasions of Vietnam, though the Viet monarch Trần Nhân Tông, decided to accept the supremacy of Kublai Khan to avoid further conflicts.The failure of the Mongol invasions was however a shattering blow for their supremacy in Asia, and Vietnam's success gave more confidence to the other Asian nations to halt the once invincible Mongol juggernaut.

I experienced that when I landed in Hanoi in late October 2022. The arrival hall was totally packed. About an hour until I got through.
 I’m wondering if anyone has experience arriving in Da Nang instead. I looked around online and there isn’t much in the way of comments about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Base on a article on “Tuoitre” According to the explanation of the Chairman of Hoi An City Nguyen Van Son, the revenue from entrance tickets serves the conservation, embellishment and restoration of monuments, renovating the infrastructure in the old quarter, and organizing events. tourism events, as well as supporting people in home renovation and renovation, etc. At the same time, it is compulsory to buy tickets for all visitors when visiting Hoi An ancient town to ensure fairness for the locality and visitors. 
 Ticket prices are issued at 120,000 VND/ticket for international visitors and 80,000 VND/ticket for domestic visitors. Such a two-price policy that distinguishes between domestic and foreign people, dating back several decades, is completely out of line with international practices. 
 There are two types of spaces that need to be clearly defined, where the proposed toll is public space or owned space (eg museums, monuments...). If the space is owned, the owner has the right to collect a fee. On the contrary, if it is a public space, it belongs to the whole people, belongs to everyone, and has no right to collect fees. 
 Hoi An sells entrance tickets, in the case of legality, on the one hand, it brings the city's budget but on the other hand increases the cost of tourists.
 I strongly think this is a step back for Hoi An tourism some Comment I ever read even said don’t turn “Hội An” to “Hội Ăn”

 Please recommend me some Vietnamese songs!! I must say that I am not a fan of the Vietnamese music genre(???). You know! Long, drawn-out words with vibrato, sung along with some sort of stringed instrument (sorry mom!!!). 
 I want songs with Vietnamese lyrics, but in another style. Rock & Pop-Rock are my preferred genres. Fast, upbeat! And I don't care what the lyrics say as long as they are in Vietnamese. 
 Artists/Projects I like: Kagerou Project, Weezer, Wallows, Sex Bob-Omb 
 Please do recommend me something!!! Thank you :D

 Are there good English-speaking registered dieticians in Vietnam that can help me with a nutrition plan and diet? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in Ho Chih Minh.
 I do not have time to cook my food.
 I just go to cheap shops or street food.
 In the street, I see them offering food like rice, fish, chicken, etc.
 When I walk in the street, I just eat the food. 
 In the English speaking Countries, it is not recommend to eat outside due to how processed and expensive the food it is.
 Here in Vietnam, the food is so cheap. However, is the food healthy? Do they use cheap oil to cook? Do they use a lot of oil?
 Thanks!

 I recently moved to Hanoi, Vietnam, to start a new chapter here. I love this place so much but I find myself often confused on how many options I have for grocery shopping, and it got me thinking about where could I find the best prices of groceries in spite of being a foreigner. I have got some names of some supermarkets but I was wondering If I could go even cheaper to buy groceries. If anyone here has any idea I would really appreciate it and hopefully others coming to Vietnam can benefit from this post if someone drops any value here.
 Thank you and have a nice day

 Being from the UK, I can’t say I’ve had much actual experience with what Falun Gong is beyond the whole China situation, which as you can imagine often attracts a lot of negativity and general bad feeling. 
 I’m wondering how Falun Gong is actually viewed by Vietnamese people. I’m guessing given the amount of times I’ve come across practitioners, it’s viewed more favourably than it is in the UK or other places.

Her family apparently follows Cao Dai. She herself says she has no religion, though she is quite interested in Buddhist philosophy and often reads Buddhist-flavored self-help books (like Thich Nhat Hanh and Haemin Sunim).
 Anyway, she's incredibly kind, fun-loving, philosophical, selfless, and more. I'm just wondering whether coming from a family that follows Cao Dai is like the Vietnamese equivalent of a Mormon family, a Scientology family, or really just no big deal? Is there anything I should be aware of?

For additional context, He is a city guy and I’m more of a nature and landscape gal. We both like water. So based on that I was curious which itinerary anyone would anyone recommend in mid October taking into account the central region rainy season. We also want to ensure we have the most sun/best warm weather in the islands.
 I’m not sure on the amount of days yet in each place so any recommendations are welcome :) also are there any “must see” places I am missing that would fit into the below with the amount of time we have? Thank you!! 
 Itinerary 1 Land in Hanoi-> Sapa-> Halong Bay -> hoian? (Not sure if I should avoid due to rain) Fly to Ho Chi Minh -> Phu Quoc islands then back to Ho Chi Minh to fly home 
 Itinerary 2 Land in Hochiminh -> Phu Quoc islands -> back to Ho Chi Minh-> fly to Hanoi -> Sapa -> Halong bay -Hanoi and any day trips from there then fly home from Hanoi

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Reddit friends, first of all a big thanks for your helpful answers on my earlier questions about life in Hanoi/Vietnam!
 Next question, I understand that tab water in Hanoi is not clean enough to drink and that there was even an scandal in 2019. Since I drink a lot of water, try to avoid plastic bottles and will stay around four years, I'm considering buying a more heavy duty purifier, such as the Bluewater Spirit. https://www.bluewatergroup.com/product/bluewater-spirit/
 Does anyone have experience using such products in Hanoi/Vietnam? Or are there better local options? Thanks!

I'd preferably want there to be two capitals, the western capital and the eastern capital, The western capital could be either Sylhet or Chittagong (Chattogram) and the eastern capital could be either Bangkok or Hanoi. I personally think that it would be great. I mean, look at India, it has different cultures and languages/language-families (Indo-European, Dravidian etc.).. I want these countries that I mentioned to be one country for the greater good (of humanity). Even if they were to merge, they would not be as big in size as China, India or the USA but they would be bigger in size than as they are presently.These countries that I mentioned are all connected by land, not just the water (for some more context, for those reading and looking to get it). If anyone else on here who sees this also wants this to happen, please feel free to give some suggestions and let's gather some ideas on seeing if this could actually go forth.
 P.S.: I haven't thought of a name for the proposed country yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all I want to say after spending 2 of my 3 weeks in Vietnam so far it's been great. I have spent time all over the country and have been to Ho Chi Minh, Da Lat, Nha Trang, Da Nang and Hoi An. Every city have had its unique feeling and I have loved it so far.
 Now I'm finally in Ha Long, this was supposed to be the real tropical paradise stop with beaches and swimming. Boating through the unique Islands in the bay and just relax before going to Hanoi for the flight back home. 
 I decided to go on a bot trip while in Ha Long and just enjoy the almost mystical atmosphere you get boating through the bay between hundreds of small rocky islands.But this absolutely broke my heart, instead of a mystical and paradise like environment we got nothing but waters absolutely full of trash. 
 It didn't matter where you looked, it was just full of mostly styrofoam blocks and other plastic waste, but also some random wood and other garbage also floating around. And I'm not surprised that the waters are so littered, there where hundreds of tourist boats in the bay at any given time. Unfortunately this seem to partly be because of over tourism in the bay, and going through Ha Long city there seem to be alot of relatively new developments but 70% of it looked to be empty or abandoned. 
 I am just a tourist that get to see this city for a limited time, can anyone from the area tell me more about how you perceive the city's and they bays development over the past few years. And if you have toured Ha Long just as me and have similar or very contrasting experiences, please share. 
 Love from Sweden 🇸🇪

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be spending nearly 3 weeks in Vietnam starting later this month and want to buy an eSIM before I go. It sounds like Viettel has by far the best service, especially to more remote areas where I'll be going. I'd like to buy a tourist eSIM directly from Viettel and found their site https://tourist.viettel.vn/ . Looks like I have to provide a lot of personal information (including passport photo) before they provide details. Anyone have experience with buying directly from this site? I wanted to check before I provide my personal info. Thanks!

Or that i should have a little bow when greeting someone. Anything else like this that might be uncommon for me, an european, but is customs in Vietnam? I am asking because i want to respect the people i will meet when visit this country, and want to make sure i also follow their customs as a gratitude for welcoming me in their country! Thank you!

Now we have got our 30 day visa, but the stamp in the passport says, that we have to leave Vietnam at the 12th April. We want to leave it at the 24th. Then we stayed here 28 days in total. Is it now possible, to expand the permission to stay with our visum without traviling outside of vietnam? Maybe at the immigration office in Hanoi? Has everyone tried that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am *thinking* about taking an extended backpacing trip through Vietnam. I have never backpacked before so tbh I’m not even sure what that means. I am looking for any and all advice as I formulate my plan of travel. 
 Budgeting; if I am trying to keep it mid to low cost how much can I expect to pay per day? I found some posts that said 50$ a day would be sufficient if I stay in hostels, hitchhike, and take the bus places. (That was including lodging). Does this hold true?
 Things to do: as I have no idea what Vietnam is like i plan to soak up as much as possible. I’m told any and all caves are worth a visit. Is there anyone out there who has been to Vietnam before and is willing to share or send me their itinerary? I can taylor it to my needs but i would be forever greatful to you kind stranger. 
 If I want to travel to a different country after Vietnam has anyone had experience applying for a multi trip visa? (Google can probably answer that one for me but there’s nothing better than first hand knowledge).
 Any and all wisdom is greatly appreciated. I plan to Only bring a 40-50L backpack too. Is this feesable.? Experienced backpackers, any pointers on what I should pack and how many of each item? I tend to over pack so I would probably do 2 weeks worth of clothes if I can fit it in the backpack but if someone is able to get away with less then i‘d happily pack lighter.

He honked and honked. While trying to pass us, the other car hit our side mirror. I could look into the other car and saw a young man in a military uniform looking very angry at us, like we were the inconvenience to him. After he passed by, I could see a red colored license plate. If I am not mistaken, that plate belongs to the military and is ranked the highest among other plates. After complaining to other people that an officer does not adhere to the law, they told me that those people ARE the law. Even normal police officers couldn’t do anything about it.

 Some details about us: I am a foreigner and she is Vietnamese. We have been together for 7 years. We went broke together and came out of it doing well now. We have been through sickness (somewhat) and are in health. We use to fight about trivial matters and misunderstandings due to the language barrier but we learned to communicate better and rarely ever fight nowadays. We also have a daughter together and we are about to achieve our dream of owning our own house very soon. 
 Can you recommend me any Vietnamese love songs with lyrics or meaning similar to Bon Jovi's "Thank you for loving me"? 
 Really appreciate it!

 I'm a student from VN currently living in the U.S. and my VN passport is nearing expiration so I have to renew it via mail. I looked at the embassy website and they said to submit a processing fee but didn't specify how much. I tried to reach them by their regular phone number and email (no one answered/voicemail was full), and when I finally got through the hotline the guy who picked up just got mad at me lol. If you have experience applying for passport renewal recently please share how you did it/how much it cost. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! 👋
 Long story short, the hotel where I am going to stay in Hanoi in November gave me some good deals for a 2-day/1-night cruise on one of the ships mentioned in the title. The problem is that I can't seem to figure out which one to choose...
 Le Theatre has a great dinner place with a piano and good outdoor areas on top, but I have seen comments about degradation problems and it not being very clean.
 Scarlet Pearl seems to be very new and clean, but it may have fewer outdoor areas...
 As for the itinerary, I think both are equivalent.
 Which one do you guys think I should choose?
 Thanks! 😁

When we go out to eat, should I order my own food or just let him order and ask for extra plates?
 I have several mental health issues and my child is autistic. I am high functioning, receive mental health services, work full time and have full custody of my kids. I know it’s not appropriate to discuss emotions in many Asian cultures but I feel like it’d be the right thing to do to bring it up eventually. How should I do this? Should I be prepared for him to see me as weak and leave?
 What’s the best way to show him I care? My love language is touch but I wouldn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable in public. Would it be acceptable make a dessert for him? 
 What else do I need to know?
  
Thank you!!!

 We have spent two days here and have decided to abandoned ship and move on with the rest of the country. The main reason is that there is not much to do, and nowhere worth going to eat. 
 It obviously depends on what you like, but if it includes meat, you wont be getting that. Almost all meat here is not what it is advertised as, and will likely destroy your stomach the next day. We spent hours researching restaurants to eat at and compared to the rest of Vietnam, they are really quite pathetic. 4.7-5 star reviews on many restaurant are just an absolute joke. 
 Da Lat is a picturesque city with a nice climate this time of year. The hotels are all a bit tired and run down but that is to be expected considering the location. There are some nice bars hidden away for people to discover and you can do some small touristy activities like Crazy House, Coaster, Bike trips but that's about it. 
 It is interesting that there are not many honest reviews containing criticism of any places in this country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[seeing as vietnamese has so many loanwords from french colonization, albeit with differences ofc in spelling and pronunciation, do you think a vietnamese speaker would have an easier time learning french than say, a japanese speaker, due to the linguistic influences? (for example sa bông for savon, etc) would some vocabulary or language be recognizable or instinctual, or not at all? anyone here who speaks or is learning both, do you find similarities in the two languages?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It wasn't too long ago when Singapore was a "backwater" town. South Korea was poor from the war, just like what happened to Vietnam. They worked hard and now Singapore and South Korean are rich.
 Do you think Vietnam will be rich like Singapore or South Korea? Why or why not?
 As a white American, I think Vietnam has the potential to get rich but not too fast please.
 Edit: thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been living here for over a year now and I'm curious to know what are some recommended insurance plans that other Americans use that won't break the bank. When I first came here I had world nomads, but they turned out to be no good after I was hospitalised and didn't plan on returning home anytime back to the states. They said that exempt me from getting my claim. Then I had Safetywing but they are more of a (you pay now and file a claim and we will send you the money later) kind of deal. I'm living in HCMC and am just looking for a good insurance plan I can rely on if I do get injured and I can just go to the hospital (Probably Vinmec) and just get helped on the spot no questions asked. Can anyone give me any recommendations?

I read the road was very steep getting into/out of the park and was wondering if anyone had done it on a motorbike and could tell me if it’s ok to attempt or I should just take a guided tour? I’m very experienced on a motorcycle for what it’s worth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm Vietnamese and I've eaten Nem Chua all my life and I've recently realized that Lao and Thai people have a very similar raw fermented Sausage that is called Naem. Is this a cognate where the word (possibly origin?) comes from the same source or is a coincidence? Vietnamese considers a lot of "sausage meat" related food "Nem" like in Nem Nuong and Nem Ran and I'm not sure if Thai and Lao people consider other meat Nem/Naem like in Vietnamese. I've done some research and fermented sausage eaten raw is unique to South East Asia so it would make sense if they come from a similar origin somewhere in South East Asia as opposed to the cooked Lap Xuong that comes from China.

 In May, I have a flight that will have a 6 hour layover in Ho Chi Minh airport.
 ​
 I was wondering if anybody could tell me if this would be enough time to at least visit the city center or some interesting areas nearby the airport or if this is not enough.
 ​
 I'm traveling on a Mexican Passport so I would need to process an E-Visa which is 25 USD, which is not a problem at all but if it's not even enough time to visit the outsides I would rather just transit in the airport.
 ​
 Thank you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[even if i’m living in an area with many ethnic minorities including other viet ppl, i will constantly get asked if im chinese or taiwanese. both of my parents are from vietnam (and supposedly both ethnically vietnamese) but we usually get mistaken for chinese or other east asian by other viet ppl. one time in a pho restaurant the owner was speaking to other clients in vietnamese and then switched to english when we arrived, thinking we were chinese. i know we did share a lot of colonial history with china but i’m not sure what determines the stereotype of features/appearance nowadays. other than the idea of SEA being “more tan” are there any significant phenotypic differences between chinese and vietnamese people? do you ever get mistaken for one or the other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm writing a Pokemon story where one of the regions is inspired by modern-day Vietnam, and I was wondering what elements of Vietnam would work well in Pokemon. This includes towns, cities, gyms, and The Elite Four. I came here because people on this subreddit know more about Vietnam than me. I take inspiration from other cultures in my writing so I can learn more about said cultures, and I don't wanna accidentally offend anyone. If anyone has suggestions on what elements of Vietnam would work well in my Pokemon story, please comment them down below!
 Here are the gyms and elite four:
 Gyms:
 Gym 1: Poison
 Gym 2: Psychic
 Gym 3: Electric
 Gym 4: Ground
 Gym 5: Normal
 Gym 6: Rock
 Gym 7: Dragon
 Gym 8: Steel
 ​
 Elite Four:
 Elite 1: Dark
 Elite 2: Grass
 Elite 3: Fighting
 Elite 4: Fairy
 Champion: Ice

 It's Monday there when I post this, so are there any good local memes?

 Me and my girlfriend are planning to visit your beautiful country this September. Probably from end of August till mid-September.
 However, I have found out that during this time Vietnam experiences relatively a lot of rain in some parts of the country. 
 We planned to visit Hanoi, Sapa, Ha long Bay, Ninh Binh, Hoi an, Hue and Phu quoc. Now I have read mixed information in the internet, so I thought I would ask maybe a local or someone who already visited Vietnam during this time period. Is end of August till mid-September a good time to visit these locations or which should I eventually skip?

Vậy nếu bạn có cơ hội đi du lịch khám phá Việt Nam, bạn muốn đến tỉnh/thành phố nào nhất? (Vietnam has many beautiful provinces, cities, beaches or majestic high mountains such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hue, Ha Giang, Lao Cai, Nha Trang, Da Nang, Phu Quoc,... So if you have the opportunity to travel to explore Vietnam, which province/city would you like to visit the most?)

 Ban đầu em có dự tính thi vào thiết kế đồ họa (em thích ngành này từ năm lớp 9) nhưng mà nghĩ lại và nghe mọi người khuyện nhủ thì em lại đang khá phân vân, liệu mình chọn ngành này sau này thu nhập có ổn định không, có đủ để gửi tiền hàng tháng về cho bố mẹ được không...có lẽ em thích là một chuyện nhưng nếu sau này ra trường lương lại ít hơn số tiền bỏ ra thì em thấy có lỗi với bố mẹ lắm ạ..
 Em đang phân vân giữa kiến trúc, ,thiết kế đồ họa, thiết kế nội thất. Ba ngành này em học ngành nào cũng được và sẽ quyết tâm đến cùng ( em có thế mạnh về vẽ và Toán Lý, biết sử dụng pts)
 Mọi người tư vẫn cho em với ạ
 em cảm ơn🌹

I can be wholesome and also party(although i have slowed down in my late 20s) I’ve traveled from the south up north 3 years ago so I’m familiar with the landscape. Did the whole backpacking thing already. My interest includes art, tattooing, fishing, motorcycles, tech, music, traveling.

 I want to know if it is appropriate to mention, or talk about my interest in engaged buddhism and Thich Nhat Hanhs work in the work place, particularly in education field/working with children? (or just in general)
 Is he a figure that is respected by Vietnamese people? Or will I get judged or looked at differently after mentioning my interest in his books and values? Might it be offensive to mention? I also don’t want to offend anyone!!
 I know this is a very very generalized statement, but it’s something I have been thinking about a lot, especially when learning about Thays history with the Vietnamese government etc.
 Thank you so much in advance!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! This summer, I'll move to Hanoi (from Rome) for a four-year diplomatic posting. I'm super excited to explore Hanoi and the rest of Vietnam and have a few questions that you can hopefully help me answer.
  
Are there any essentials that are hard to get by in Hanoi? My employer will arrange a moving company, so I have the option of stashing up in Rome before the move. 
 
Where should I live? I am looking for a neighbourhood with a good connection to the Old Quarter for my daily commute (see Q3). I'm coming alone and would prefer an area with a local vibe that is relatively quiet and clean. My employer pays for my accommodation so fortunately I have a wider choice budget wise. 
 
Is my e-bike enough or should I buy a scooter? I currently own a VanMoof S3 with a top speed of roughly 30 km/h.
 
I have the opportunity of following two weeks of full-time language classes. Can you recommend any schools? A school slightly outside of Hanoi with room and board is possible too. 
 
How to get social? I am no noob to making new friends in new environments, but any tips are very welcome!
 
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found Vietnamese businesses like restaurants and coffee shops abroad to be really unfriendly. On several occasions we went inside a Vietnamese restaurant and were completely ignored. So when we finally went on vacation to Vietnam, we were not expecting much in terms of customer service...
 However in Vietnam the customer service turned out to be fantastic! Restaurants and coffee shop workers were really friendly. Hostel owners would treat you like family. Even tiny food stall owners were super kind. Locals would help you order food and give you suggestions. It was really like some kind of Customer Service Fairy Tale
 Then I came back from the vacation, and decided to go to a Vietnamese coffee shop. The cashier didn't say anything at all when I ordered.
 I'm just wondering why there is such a huge discrepancy in customer service between businesses in Vietnam and abroad

 Amazing. And they stack so nicely!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chao ban! I'm wondering about how some of the Indigenous religious traditions overlap (if at all) as I reconnect with precolonial heritage.
 A lot of the articles I read seem to put more emphasis on Len Dong / spirit mediumship happening in the North but also with a handful of practitioners in diaspora like in California of the US who have been trained or came into the role through heredity (e.g. family has a history of it).
 For Ca Ong/whale worship, a lot of coastal villages including the one part of my family came from still do it, but we're disconnected from the culture due to deaths in the family and immigration away from the country. And it seems each village celebrates their festival differently at different moons (TraVinh where some of my relatives were from for example is supposedly on the 3rd lunar month, others do the 6th), and some blend Buddhist traditions with the mourning of a deceased whale, while others remain rooted in Cham culture, and others potentially adopted the Nguyen Dynasty's official policies to worship Can Ong but kept their own local practices too.
 So I'm wondering what the ceremonies and protocols are like, and if the two religions ever overlap, what the ceremonies entail, and what route might be good to inquire further to connect with first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I’m of Vietnamese ancestry, but was born in the United States, and have lived there all my life. However, I visit Vietnam for holiday periodically, and after hearing my (limited) Vietnamese skills, I’m often asked by locals: “Are you Viet Kieu?”
 It seems like a simple question, but I’ve received different answers from locals, relatives, and the internet. To make it more confusing, the meaning seems to have change from older to younger generations. Can you help?
 Is Viet Kieu: - someone born in Vietnam that now lives overseas - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry who now wishes to live in Vietnam again?
 And more importantly (for me)…does Viet Kieu have a bad connotation for locals?
 Thanks for your help!
 Edit: Added small detail for clarity. And wow, thank you for all the thoughtful responses.

 I fly out of Laguardia or Albany, but if another airport is cheaper, that is close, please let me know.

 Sometimes the option to "re-route" is blocked by yet another feral dog who came out into the street behind you. 
 I've noticed they have a tendency to follow a person if they try to walk away. And obviously running is stupid beyond all belief. 
 Is there a safe way to pass one of these possibly rabid beasts?
