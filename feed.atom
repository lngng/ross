        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few questions about the housing market in HCMC. I’m really just asking out of curiosity since I can’t actually purchase a SFR in Vietnam. Reading about Seoul’s fucked-up housing situation kind of freaks me out so I’m kind of curious about what’s happening in HCMC. 
 My aunt “recently” sold their childhood house in D3 of HCMC for ~$500K USD. This is just what I overheard so I could honestly be mistaken, but this seems like a crazy amount for someone in VN to purchase considering the average annual salary of someone in HCMC. The only thing that stands out about this house to me is that it’s unlike the standard tall, narrow row houses with 4+ floors and had two floors, was much “wider” than it was tall, and had a backyard. It was a little out of place relative to the other structures around it. 
 Is this “standard” pricing throughout most of HCMC? Sorry, I know this is a particularly stupid question since HCMC is massive. 
 Do most people in HCMC “dream” about purchasing single family residences or has the goal shifted to purchasing a nice condo? Another family member told me that you can reasonably expect a newer condo to go for about ~$80K USD which still seems disproportionately high for the average salary, but I don’t know. 
 Who is still able to purchase a “house” or a “condo”? 
 Would you say the majority of people in HCMC today were born and raised there or moved there in the last 20 or so years?

 I bought it in Danang from one of the big electronic stores. There are three A52 models. Mine is the regular A52 that does not support 5G. Model SM-A525F/DS.

 We are desperate to find it because it is exactly what you would expect from similar covers. (Thai Tai's "Never Gonna Give You Up" cover is peak 90s cheesy and unexpected.) I am actively combing through my playlists and discography to find it, and am wondering if the song goes by a different title in Vietnamese.
 I recall it was Trung Hanh or someone similar who sang it, but I cannot accurately recall.
 Thanks in advance,

My question is not why such practices exist (presumably all are somehow intended to minimize theft) and what they might indicate about society---that has been discussed here before.
 Instead, my question is where and how they originated. Can anybody shed light on where, how and when these practices became widespread in VN---and how they spread to become ubiquitous across the country?
 (Obviously these practices are not all unique to VN; that's irrelevant.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm long-term renting a house here in VN and like most other houses there is a large-ish altar built in to a wall (complete with switched yellow lights) and another altar above the kitchen hearth. 
 I'm not Vietnamese and so the concept of ancestor veneration is totally foreign to me, but I appreciate that it's a part of the culture here. In my own house though, I really don't care. So the kitchen alter is currently holding spices, and the main home alter is bare (I was thinking it'd be good for books and knickknacks).
 My question: Am I going to offend someone or put them off if they visit my house? Am I exposing myself to some supernatural peril? I've previously lived in places with a mezuzah and Mary in a clamshell and don't see how this is different, but my landlady is nice and if using an alter as a spice rack is disrespectful I don't want to rock the boat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am Vietnamese American. I was born in the United States, to Vietnamese Immigrants. Paris By Night for a long long time was my only cultural string to my heritage. I learned everything about Vietnamese culture from them.
 As I understand however, Thuy Nga has been struggling to expand it's audience base. The younger generation especially in the US is not as tied into the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War so those older songs ( aren't that appealing ). DVD sales are useless now. And the " Young " Singers that Thuy Nga has; well for one thing, they're not that good at singing, and they're not " Young ". One of Thuy Nga's " Young " Singers, Diem Suong is 33 years old. And Nhu Loan is 41. 
 Enter Myra Tran. She was not recruited by Thuy Nga. But rather, came to them through American Idol. She's now ( so far at least ) doing pretty well in Vietnam, while having some success in the US with Paris By Night.
 ​
 What do you guys think ? Can Thuy Nga adapt to new audience through Myra Tran ?

I'm only concerned about the car having a level 2 automated driving system ( I get used to in my country before) or full speed acc. My Vietnamese wife told me when the car was imported to Vietnam, they will cut off this function. But I believe some brands probably can find it.
 Can you recommend a car brand or model that has this system? Thank you a lot!

Driver was driving like an asshole and I'm not surprised we got into an accident at all. Do I have any recourse here? They put us on another bus that only has room on the floor for the next 4 hours. I would expect some kind of compensation or money back for dealing with this, but as a non-vietnamese speaker I don't know what chance I'll have to actually get that.
 Edit: The bus company is Ngọc Cường VIP
 It was a head on collision with a commercial delivery truck

 Last night at around 9pm, a small brown dog of about 3kg and 8 months old escaped the house. The dog's name is Bơ.
 The neighborhood the dog was lost in is near Kim Mã and Nguyễn Chí Thanh.
 If you have seen the dog or would have any information that could help out, I would appreciate it. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the happy situation that I have the chance to visit Vietnam for an extended period of time with my wife and kid in late 2023. When I'm doing research it seems to me that tourist accommodation on beach destinations mostly are big hotels, tall buildings with all sorts of ammeneties, A/C and so on. I'm curious if there are any areas of Vietnam where the types of rustic low key bungalows/chalets common on e.g. island beaches in Thailand, are the norm?
 Thank you very much for your help and opinions 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Vietnam Redditors,
 Please, help me understand how Vietnam railways work, as I'm severely confused...
 I'm planning on visiting Vietnam in April, and wanted to book SE3 overnight train from Ninh Binh to Dong Hoi in advance. The problem is: I get different options depending on which website I use.
 If I try official dsvn.vn I can book a bed in 6-beds car, operated by, as far as I understand Vietnam Railways itself:
 https://preview.redd.it/wxgfmsgvj0ja1.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=246be640edd3e9d999b8fc3d4658c29828db0bb6
 If I search through baolau.com, I am presented with 4-Berth sleeping cabin, operated by New Livitrans Express:
 https://preview.redd.it/7zruwhogk0ja1.jpg?width=1143&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c6e0b44d9e051972fdff8c43c82546deb1438e3
 Finally, 12go.asia shows two separate trains, seemingly departing at the very same time: one operated by Vietnam Railways, another by Violette Express Train. Both seems to offer 4-Berth Sleepers?
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/yqnx4uq8l0ja1.jpg?width=1147&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32b9b500ac10f136f14364c06286222c51c4c4bb
 Whom should I trust? Is it a single train with carts by different operators?
 Any help will be greatly appreciated! :)

Is it a gimmick? Something to draw clientele in? Get a haircut by a beautiful woman? Or is there a room in the back where someone's getting jerked off? Was trying to figure it out but I'm stumped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Americans always blamed northern Vietnam for invading southern Vietnam and that the United States simply came and supported southern Vietnam.
 They don't know why they lost that war. It is clear that Vietnam is a unified whole, there is no "southern Vietnam" and there is no "northern Vietnam". The Americans invaded Vietnam and the northern Vietnamese had the silent support of the people of South Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam was able to kick the American troops out of Vietnam.
 The Vietnamese people were in the old regime, injected with money by the US and spent it personally and without control. When the US withdrew, they lost funding, their living standards were reduced, so they were not used to it and tried to blame the communists. If the US wins, then Vietnam is now divided into two poles and will always be tense like "North Korea and South Korea" - obviously of the same origin but separated.

 So for context, I'm a high school student living in Ha Noi. Thanks to my parents' connections, I've got a part-time job that fits my schedule perfectly, and the job pays quite well for a high school student (unfortunately they wouldn't hire outsiders). From that job I've saved up more than 100mil vnd. I dont know what to do with it. I'm definitely going to a college/university in the future, so should I set it aside to pay for my tuition fee? Or should I try to learn how to invest it? An online business, maybe? 
 What would you do if u were me,,,??? Oh and im gonna set aside like 30mil in case of emergencies.

I have been given given two choices for where to work: in District 12 on the west side of the airport or in the far east of District 2. I've been told District 12 is more likely to be where I will be working.
 With that in mind, where do you recommend I live? I want to have a fairly urban lifestyle with lots to do, see, eat, drink, and shop. Districts 1, 3, 4 and such look quite nice but are super far. I'm not sure what is in District 12 as it looks quite far, so I'm not sure if it has more comfortable apartments or not. Any advice would be welcome.
 Also, is it generally easy to change your working location after a few months?

 We’re a same sex couple planning a trip to VN in a few months. I’m intending on proposing to them at a semi private venue (there may be spectators around the area, but it’s nowhere public).
 I know there’s a growing positive sentiment towards LGBTQ rights in VN, but I’m not sure how friendly locals would be to seeing something like a marriage proposal. Will I be inviting negative reactions or reception? I just don’t want to create an awkward environment for us in doing this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I know this might be a long shot but this is probably the only place where someone can help me with this question.
 I'm currently working on a video of my trip in Vietnam last December and i would love to start the video with someone saying something in Vietnamese. I will be using only the audio so no need to film yourself or anything. Just a recording on your phone will be fine, if possible with as little background noise as possible, although i know that's difficult in Vietnam.
 The sentence i'd like to use is something like: "Hi! I would like to tell you about my Vietnam experience. Are you ready?" But of course translated to Vietnamese. 
 If anyone is willing to help me out, that'll be amazing!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I will be moving to Vietnam next month and have just been informed that my home campus for the school I will work for is in Binh Long (near Aeon mall). 
 I don’t know much about this area, as when I lived in HCM before (not for long), I lived in Thao Dien and only really went to D1/D2/D3. Also most videos I watch are mainly based in these districts as well. 
 I want somewhere that’s not extremely touristy/‘expat-y’ (like Thao Dien and most of D1), but also has plenty of stuff to do and places to eat/drink, and not too far from touristy areas I can visit if I wanted (such as Nguyen hue). I originally planned to live in D3 as it seemed to fit these criteria.
 I realise BL isn’t actually that far from these areas, but I’m guessing with traffic and other factors, it would make the daily commute quite long and tedious. 
 I’d also want somewhere with decent accommodation options for around 8tr. 
 Thanks in advance for the help!

        <updated>2023-02-16T10:19:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just received an ESL teaching offer from a well-known company in Vietnam. I would appreciate some advice on one of the terms in the contract, as follows:
 "In addition, by law, [company name] must be able to show at such an audit as referenced in the Decree No. 03/2014/ND-CP Article 8, full and complete details of all employees who are working at [company name] […] Only original documents (they will state 'This is notarised as an original' or similar) will be returned to you at the time of your leaving [company name]. Any notarised copies will be returned after not more than 3 months."
 So, I am planning to notarise and legalise copies of my degree and CELTA certificates, and give these to the company so they can process my work permit. I don't want to spoil my originals with stamps, and I'd be reluctant to hand over my originals in any case.
 I'm from the UK, and the process for notarising and legalising copies for use in Vietnam is very time-consuming and expensive. I'm unclear why the company would need to keep these officially notarised and legalised copies rather than a digital scan or physical copy of these, if it's just for audit purposes (a copy of a copy if you like). I'm concerned that it might be a ploy to stop me obtaining a separate work permit in the event that I wanted to work for another company (after the 3 month period stipulated).
 Is this standard practice, or should I be concerned? Any experience or advice would be much appreciated.

 Trash all over the place, shoe bags are reused, cramped seats, no wifi no charging station, no blanket, no water, no privacy curtain, very little headroom, and an aggressive driver. Speeding and honking his horn excessively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm currently in Vietnam and am considering getting a Vietnamese drip coffee maker. There are hundreds of generic metal or pottery style ones, but I've found a much more unique one, hand made with copper or bronze.
 Because it is a lot more unique, it's also a lot more expensive (3 or 4 times more expensive). It feels weird to bargain because it's a small handmade store, but it is quite expensive, more money then I would like to pay. Would it be fair to ask for a cheaper price? I wouldn't cut it as low as I would with more traditional street souvenir shops. I'm not sure if there is etiquette around where to try and negotiate prices. 
 Thanks in advance!

 My wife is trying to make some veggie for our kid who is under a year old but he has a few teeth and can chew soft and small food. My wife wants to use her recipe but we live in a small town and we cannot find any brocolli here.
 What veggie do Vietnamese usually give their young child and how do you prepare it? We do have premade babies food from Avakids and Concung but we want to try some home-made solution. Any recipe would be appreciated!

I am on a very strict /r/carnivore diet due to an autoimmune condition, and I mostly eat only beef, butter and eggs. Occasionally seafood. I eat around 1 lb of meat per day, sometimes a little more.
 ​
 How difficult will it be to maintain my strict diet while in Saigon? I usually cook at home, but will probably have to eat out while there.
 ​
 When I'm desperate in the US, I can even go to McDonalds and eat the meat patties without the bun or lettuce, sauce, etc. Is the meat at McDonald's comparable to the US meat patties in quantity & quality?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My husband and I are travelling to Vietnam in 2 weeks time starting in Hanoi and travelling south to HCMC stopping via Hue and Hoi An over the course of 2 weeks. We booked to go this time of year as we thought it was the best compromise of temperature/ being dry. Getting excited I checked the weather forecast earlier today and was a bit disheartened to see that it looks rainier than I was expecting. 
 I would love to hear from anyone in any of those places at the moment what the weather's really like and if I should maybe re-think what I was planning and packing a few more waterproofs 😅
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I'm a European, I work full remote and I'm in Japan now. It's pretty cold here so I'm planning a 10-12 days work holiday trip to Vietnam soon, end of February beginning of march probably, looking for some spring like weather.
 I've read a couple of posts where people tend to lean Hanoi rather than Ho Chi Minh as a tourist destination but I am not sure. I would be fine with either. I understand Hanoi si less vibrant, more traditional, which is ok. I'm not looking for nightlife as I will be working. I don't want to exclude Ho Chi Minh though.
 It would be my first visit to Vietnam and I'm pretty excited. My concern is the weather, as I read that Hanoi tends to be colder? I'm leaving Japan for that reason, so I don't want to find myself in the same situation.
 Also, I would like to work with my laptop around the city and enjoy the famous Vietnamese coffee culture. Is it safe? I'm used to Japan where pickpocketing is not a thing and I read some posts here pointing out that snatching phones is rather common. Is that true? I would be screwed without my computer. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The continued economic turmoil there got me wondering about this. If there was civil unrest that threatened the Laos government, what would happen if China sent troops in under the guise of supporting the government or protecting their investments.? Given Laos has be a defacto puppet of Vietnam for much of it's existence and and there's always been rumours of VN troops supporting the government even in recent times against the Hmong and in the past against Thailand, would there be a response? I think it's fair to say that Vietnam at least considers Laos a part of it's sphere of influence, and while China would presumably prefer to continue to buy influence as they're currently doing in Laos and Cambodia, civil unrest could change things. Not saying it's likely, just wondering what would the reaction of the VN government and people be?

I’ll be landing in Ho Chi Minh City and that will be my planned home base but I want to travel to several places in the two weeks that I have. I’m planning on a day trip to Cu Chi and am wondering what the recommendation would be for visiting the Mekong delta. I think I could spend two days there based on other places I want to see. Would you recommend I stay a couple nights there somewhere or should I plan on maybe two different day trip tours? I would greatly value your advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I forgot to get a travel adapter for my trip to Hanoi in 2 days time. Is it a popular item in Hanoi shops? I know the airport would have, but I’m sure they are very overly priced. I need to plug it into the hotel power and use my Singapore (UK) 3-prong adapters to charge my devices.

Given that Vinfast has been more silent recently, I am curious what would happen to Vinfast and Vingroup as a whole in the coming months and years? Would Vinfast pull out of the US market and would Vinfast likely crumble just like what happened to Vinsmart? Also, if Vinfast crumbles, what does it mean for Vingroup and Vietnam as a whole?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, so I see questions recurring here on importing things from other countries into Vietnam. I do this from time to time, so figured I could tell you what to expect by documenting the last batch a little.
 First, I only import non-food items. My understanding is importing food is more difficult.
 Second, I import for personal use, and pay full duties (usually 10%). I could probably import as my company, but the paperwork is not worth the time for the fees saved, so I don't bother and just pay.
 Here's the general process:
  
Order your things. Keep the invoice (or other proof of payment) and shipping manifest. You can ship to a residential address without issue. Use a courier service, they will facilitate the paperwork. I typically use UPS or FedEx.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are planning on coming to Vietnam next year on vacation. I just read that Vietnam dose not recognize the international drivers license I can get issued here in the US. 
 We were hoping to rent a motor scooter like we did in Thailand when we visited.
 How would I go about driving legally?
 If there is no way to get a legal driving permit for my trip how big of a trouble would I get in if I got pulled over while driving?
 In Thailand my international permit was valid, but I saw others get pulled over and asked to pay a 300bhat "fine" to be on their way.
 Please any advice is welcome, I really want to obey the law and do things right. But my wife and I like to explore and hike and get off the beaten path if you will and not being able to drive ourselves around could get costly and put a real damper on our trip.
 Thanks in advance for your time and help. Cheers

So my girlfriend and a friend af hers are supposed to fly to Vietnam for a 2 week holiday but currently my girlfriend is stranded on Frankfurt airport because her express visa (or visum) application didn't get trough on time. She wasn't allowed on the flight because of this. My question to my fellow redditors is this: do you know of a way to try to get her application rushed trough. Or maybe someone knows someone that works at the governement departement that handles visa applications? Or maybe enter a second application? 
 It is a real longshot bu let's see if reddit can help.
 Eitherway i appreciatie anyone reading this.

My new company will sponsor me the costs and paperworks, (1st time for me as I usually have to shoulder the cost in my previous company. I am not a teacher btw.). This is the first time they will hire a foreigner as well so there HR is also not so familiar. They will assist me as much as they can but brunt of the research will be from my end. I jusy need to know the process in General. They will sponsor me but as much as possible not going through an agent. 
 Ill be doing this first time and I am aware Vietnam always changes rules regarding this. Is this even doable by a foreigner (not married to a Vietnamese too) so language could pose a problem... Just want to get an idea if this is even possible.

 Since leaving Texas no one has cared for my hair like my sister, Shamonica Alexander, Trina Stoker and Andise Altine, two stylist I've been seeing for years.
 Last Sunday. I had my hair braided in Vietnam by a woman from the Congo who pretty much tried her damnest to pull all the hair out of my scalp into too tight cornrows. I had to take them down two days later. 
 Well, I don't do my own hair and without my trusted hair stylists to rescue the tangled mess. I had a temper tantrum and cut my hair off. I initially wanted to shave it but I only had scissors. 
 Today, I looked for a salon to make me look more presentable but literally had people just flat out deny me service. 
 It took three attempts and a couple of salons to get someone to shape my hair but finally got this kind man to agree to it at N'Black Barbershop in Phan Thiet, Vietnam
 He was gentle. He didn't tear through my hair but most of all I felt respected. I'm super grateful to him. 
 Haven't had much luck today getting someone to give me a manicure or pedicure. Will save that for another day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a similar post about cockroaches in my previous apartment, I’ve moved and haven’t seen a single cockroach but today I opened my oatmeal (which had been tightly sealed) and it was full of these ants :( I’ve noticed a few of them crawling around before but paid them no mind - feel like I should do something about this now! What can I do/where can I buy something to sort this out? (Aka kill them)

 I’m a Canadian who travelled from Malaysia, now going to Ho Chi Minh, Da Nang, and lastly Hanoi.
 I’d consider myself very tattooed (both arms full, legs, and chest) from artists in Canada and some Malaysia. 
 I can’t find a definitive guideline for appropriate pricing for tattoos. Can anyone shed some light on standard hourly rates? 
 Thanks so much!

 I am currently travelling from New Zealand and accidentally left both my wallet and passport in the back of the seat in front of me on the train today.
 I caught the 15:30 train from Ga Sai Gon to Ga Binh Thuan yesterday before taking a grab further to our accommodation.
 I arrived at Ga Binh Thuan and got off the train in a rushed folly. Leaving my thungs.
 I have attempted to contact police tonight, called over 11 times, and was only received once. Before the phone was hungup.
 This is whatever, and I am sure to contact police on the phone or in person tomorrow.
 If anyone might know where my things might be/ who best to contact. 
 I will also try the train company but do not know the exact best course of action.
 Ultimately, I have travel inaurance but hope I can resolve this without resorting to it.
 Thank you kindly for any input/help/advice.

What I found were mostly toys or small plastic/wood low quality items that were painted in a rush, probably even made in China.
 What are some decent souvenirs that I can find in Hanoi? 
 Other than decorative stuff, what else I can buy, like any special spice or snack?

We declined because we could see there were other hotels with good offers on Booking.com.
 Now it's 2 hours later and we have visited 4, 4 star hotels in the old quarter who all had "Superior/deluxe/.." rooms listed as available at about 70-80% discounts on Booking and when we arrived to see the room they said that it is not available.
 We decided to book some Airbnb outside old quarter instead 😅.
 Is this normal practice in Old quarter/Hanoi/Vietnam or were we just very unlucky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm travelling to Vietnam soon, 2-3 days in HCMC, a few days on Phu Quoc island, a lot of time in Tan Chau.
 I'm very into tea and was hoping to find some tea shops that sell good quality loose leaf teas in HCMC and/or Tan Chau. As far as HCMC goes, I'll be in District 1 and District 3, with my tight schedule I won't be able to leave these areas in HCMC. 
 Any tips? I've found a few on google that look potentially promising (such as Trà Việt), but I wanted to know if there were better shops that I'm probably missing since I don't speak the language, or just some place that's a hidden gem. 
 Second, would tea be an appropriate gift for someone's family in Vietnam? We have other gifts we're bringing (Family member is getting married), but I thought I might add to it with a set of nicely presented teas as a thank you for hosting us.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

        <updated>2023-02-11T17:27:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, ChatGPT is becoming a hot topic in Vietnam because of how accessible it is to normal users and follow that trend is a booming scam market regarding to create a ChatGPT account. Because of that, I decided to make a post to guide you how to create your own legitimate ChatGPT account.
 Dạo gần đây, ChatGPT đã trở thành chủ đề nóng được quan tâm ở Việt Nam vì dịch vụ dễ dàng tiếp cận đối với người dùng bình thường, chính vì sự bùng nổ đó kéo theo vấn nạn lừa đảo liên quan đến việc tạo tài khoản ChatGPT. Chính vì thế mình quyết định viết bài post hướng dẫn tạo tài khoản ChatGPT chính gốc của bạn.
 ​
  
Because ChatGPT is not supported in Vietnam, you need a VPN to change your IP to another country. In case you don't have a VPN, vn-z forum provided a lot of vpn account for you to choose. Bởi vì ChatGPT không hỗ trợ ở Việt Nam, bạn sẽ cần VPN để chuyển địa chỉ IP của bạn sang nước khác. Trong trường hợp bạn không có VPN, diễn đàn vn-z có cung cấp tài khoản VPN cho các bạn thoải mái sử dụng.
 You need a foreign phone number for verification, I recommended smspool because it is reliable, cheap (depends on the country, most likely cost less than 1$) and I used it for my ChatGPT account myself. Các bạn cũng sẽ cần đến số điện thoại nước ngoài để xác minh danh tính, mình khuyến khích các bạn dùng smspool vì nó ổn định, rẻ (tuỳ đất nước bạn chọn, giá thành sẽ thấp hơn 20,000đ).
  
Good luck/Chúc may mắn
 Edit: ChatGPT is now supporting in Vietnam (11/2/2023), however you will need ChatGPT Plus for 20$. Depends on your need, my guide will be cheaper for you. Để tạo tài khoản ChatGPT ở Việt Nam tại thời điểm hiện tại, bạn cần đăng kí ChatGPT Plus với giá 20$ (470,000đ). Tuỳ nhu cầu sử dụng mỗi người, người dùng phổ thông không có 400,000đ dư giả để tiêu thì cách trên mình hướng dẫn rẻ hơn.

 In two weeks I will be accompanying my wife and our daughter on a short term business trip to Hanoi. Probably three months with short side trips to HCMC.
 What kind of weather can I expect?
 Is it jeans and hoodie or shorts and t-shirt?
 I've been to Vietnam a few times, but never in the north in winter/spring. So I usually pack t-shirts, shorts, light trekking pants and light trekking shirts.
 I'm a pretty big guy from the Netherlands and have no problems with cold, but heat gets to me quickly.
 Thanks a lot!

Decathlon accepts it for online payment, but Lazada doesn't (if that helps).

I was there today and saw the one sport route and the other bolts for setting up anchors. I did more research and saw that tours were operated by Phat Tire Adventures. I went to their website but could not find any information. I contacted them but have still not received a response. I would prefer to climb there without a guide, as I have all the stuff, but I wasn't sure if I was allowed. It seems strange that it is right in the middle of the main pathway. Can anyone lend any insight into this? Thanks!

For those who don't know, Li Xi is a popular celebration in Vietnamese culture, but not many people know about the darker aspects of its history. This video delves into that history and provides a new perspective on this important celebration. I think it's an interesting and eye-opening watch, and I hope you all find it as educational as I did. Check it out and let me know what you think!

Id love it to be an island, ive been looking at a lot about phu quoc, but ive heard and seen stories about it being super touristy, a lot of building work going on and a lot of rubbish on some of the beaches. Is this true? Are there any other island or costal places you would recommend that are nicer with beautiful beaches and scenery. Any help would be amazing.

 I'm planning on relocating to Ho Chi Minh City in the near future, and am having trouble finding information online regarding the availability and costs of psychiatric help in the city. Right now I am on two psychiatric medications. While it appears it would not be too difficult to purchase these medications from pharmacies, I would like to have someone in the city who can monitor the effects of the medication, ideally on a monthly basis. 
 Are psychiatrists who have a good grasp of English hard to find in Vietnam? 
 How much would a visit generally cost? 
 Would going to a private hospital monthly to be evaluated be a feasible alternative? 
 I've read about issues with 'fake' versions of medications; is there a way to ensure I can avoid these? 
 Any additional insights would be greatly appreciated!

 -Is this true? Am I allowed to work there? Can I extend the 180 days limit for another 180 days without leaving the country?
 -Any other app to find a place to stay besides Agoda, Booking, Airbnb...?
 -Any recommendations for a good Vietnamese teacher/school for beginners?
 What should I do/know/prepare or whatever before going to live in Hanoi from 15 March to 15 June?
 Any information you would like to share will be really appreciate it!
 Thank you and sorry, English is not my main language.

 Good idea? Anyone done this? By the look of travel vlogs it's what backpackers do in the north, in the mountains, but is is common in the city?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 27 and finishing up a degree in the next 6 months to get my CELTA and hopefully teach in either Vietnam or Taiwan. This is something I've wanted since I was a teenager and I will be 28 by the time this becomes possible. My motivations beyond teaching English is to learn the language, however difficult Vietnamese may prove.
 I have been debating between Taiwan or Vietnam for years and have considered as many factors as possible, but one I would like some insight on is how difficult it may prove to form friendships with locals. I do not expect anyone to be enamored by foreigners and I am not looking for super deep friendships. I am not looking for a best friend and I am not looking for a significant other. I don't expect to be grabbing dinner or drinks constantly with locals. But I do want to be friends with locals and not solely rely on other expats.
 How realistic is this in Vietnam? I understand given my age where most people will be raising families and the language/cultural differences, that it will prove to be difficult. But once I get a working grasp of Vietnamese (however long and difficult that may be), could I expect to create some friendships with people besides other expats? From what I've read, this may be easier in Vietnam vs Taiwan, and I was looking for insight. I consider myself very friendly and I am always eager to make new friends, so normally this is not difficult for me but I have no previous experience to Vietnam nor living in a country where English is not the first language.

A friend of mine said that recently, staff at Phạm Ngũ Lão bus station told him the bus to Moc Bai doesn't run any more, and to either take a private taxi or book a bus to Phnom Penh and then just get off at the border (which is obviously a lot more expensive).
 ​
 Google still shows it as an active bus route though. Can anyone confirm?

 I'll fly into Da Nang tomorrow from Malaysia. I'm a non-stop traveller, therefore I always bring all my belongings of which my drone is part of. I know that bringing a drone into the country is legal, however flying without permission is not and I reached out to so many officials in Vietnam and my local Vietnamese embassy to apply - without luck of course.
 By now, I couldn't care less about not being able to fly without a permit, but I'm worried about importing the thing via Da Nang, an airport that's notoriously famous for its customs officers' outdated mindset, with them confiscating drones. Obviously I want to avoid that and so I'm asking if anyone has made any recent experiences there and if it's still true that they only scan carry-on, but not checked bags?

 When I was in Vietnam, I was having fun but also stressed at the same time. There were too much people and traffic. As an introvert, I don’t like when it’s overcrowded. The weather was also too hot for my taste. I was also worried about getting pickpocketed, but luckily nothing happened.
 I told my mom several times that I wanted to go home. And I was so happy when it was finally time to travel back home. But now after returning, I suddenly feel depressed. I suddenly miss my relatives and all the adventures we did. I miss the food and culture also. 
 I told myself that this would be the third and final time I’m travelling to Vietnam, but now I’m itching to go back in the future. Does anyone else feel the same after their trip?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is not a critique of the country or the culture, just a curiosity question.
 I have a couple of female friends who over the past year who told me they are going to get married. 
 One of them told me that her parents are close with the parents of the the impending husband, and that her parents have wanted her to marry the guy for a while. 
 The other is being told by her parents she has to leave Vietnam and go and marry someone in Europe. Its a bit of a match making thing through friends of the family, even though she isn't that keen on going. 
 There was another very similar story I came across too this week via a friend's friend.
 Is this common? For the parents to essentially choose (or have an extremely strong preference) for who the girl should marry? I always thought this was more an Indian/South Asian thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My last visit was the month of March 2020. 
 It was one of if not the greatest month of my life even if by week three it felt like I was being chased by COVID.
 A lot of sites we had planned to visit didn't happen since most places shut down. At the time we had no idea of the future and really thought we would just visit the following year. Not knowing the world would be shut down. 
 It's almost three years later and has life really changed. I'm a home owner now, have a daughter who is 14 months and a son on the way. 
 Life has become very adulty. 😂 
 Traveling with my wife will never be the same but we always talk about our time in Vietnam.
 It's beautiful, the country is appasulty beautiful! The people are appasulty beautiful! We made such great friends on our trip even with the language barrier. Friends who we still keep in touch with till this day. 
 I know we'll be back one day most likely when we're old. Going to have to skip out on the sleep buses and over night train rides at the point. 😆
 I hope we can visit much sooner than later with or without the kids. I would love to bring my children with me, I want them to be as well traveled as myself.
 I really just wanted to let everyone know how much I miss and love Vietnam and hope to see everyone sooner than later. 
 Ps. I still have yet to find Cao Lau in the states.

 Any Saigon shops that ship to Da Nang would be cool too.

1h flight direct / 3h with layover.
 But I’ve heard there is almost always delays with domestic flights here especially with budget airlines. 
 
11h bus ride. Already done 8 hour Saigon to Da Lat & doing 4 hour Da Lat to Nha Trang tomorrow. 
 
11h train. Not heard much. 
 
 What’s the locals option on doing this? What would be my best option we are with a group of 6. Money isn’t the biggest concern but should be considered. Time definitely more valuable as we are moving place to place every 3 days roughly.

 I have recently been offered a management job to join a company in Vietnam. The salary they are offering would be 85 million đồng per month plus minor stock options in the business. 
 I current live in the UK (but not in London) and earn around 15% more than this but I believe even living in HCMC, my living expenses in Vietnam would be much less than what I have now.
 Obviously I know that the average person in Vietnam is not earning 85 million / month, but will this be enough for a foreigner to rent a city centre apartment, get a motorbike (or even car?) and live comfortably?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào các bạn!
 So after being very confused why my Vietnamese friend was saying words that end in “oc” as “op,” I decided to do some research. Apparently, in Vietnamese, you have to close your mouth for certain ending constants, so a word ending in ung would sound like “ungm.”
 My question to you guys is how say it. I remember teaching my friends how to properly pronounce the Spanish “t” by placing the tips of their tongues on the top part of the back of their teeth. I realize this question is kind of technical, but everything I’ve looked up doesn’t really address it or attributes it to an different accent or dialect (but both Northerners and Southerners do this from my knowledge).
 Any advice? Many thanks! Cảm ơn!
 I also tagged this as discussion since I can’t seem to get a clear answer on how to do this lingual maneuver.

There's one in particular I'd love to know more about: Mai dam: Mot te doan? nghe nghiep? Hinh thuc no le? (apologies for lack of tone marks I don't have the keyboard on this laptop) 
 Alternatively, if any body knows anyone who might be willing to do an oral interview with me on this sensitive topic, that would be extremely helpful. Please feel free to reach out via message!

 My fiance and I (US) are getting married this year and are doing a reception in the U.S. and in Viet Nam with my side of the family who are in Viet Nam. It will be a small affair, of about 25-30 people max, total. Does anyone know of any venues in Saigon that could host this, and/or estimates as to how much an event like this my cost? I read some anecdotes of a low key reception of 50 people costing $1k that included food, MC, music. 
 Honestly any information or experience or advice you would have would be so helpful and much appreciated. I don't even know where to start looking, lol. Cảm ơn nhiều!

 That said last week an old geezer rear ended my PCX on his 25 year old Wave, or whatever it was.
 Pretty sure he'd been at the Bia Hoi, and 99% sure his vision wasn't 20/20. Add in that it happened at night.
 It's said that Thailand is the second most dangerous country in the world re. traffic accidents and fatalities.
 Where does Vietnam fit into the picture re. the aforementioned?
 I drive really slowly, be it in the city or on the bigger roads. Seems that's the key. A colleague said to me he treats everyone as a drunk driver looking at their phone.
 Then you have the buffalo boys who hoon around town, helmetless. Surely these guys don't last long?
 Interested in what you've seen/been involved in/heard re. the madness that is Vietnamese traffic.
 *Note: not shitting on Vietnam, just want some feedback. For me, traffic and dodgy bosses are the least pleasant aspect of living here. They are balanced out, or outweighed by the positives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My apologies if this isn't permitted here.
 I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy A04 about a week ago because I was having issues with my US phone. I paid 2.590.000 ₫ at the FPT Shop in Hoi An. My other phone is now working just fine (of course) and I no longer need the new phone. I have been told that because it was activated that I cannot return it. It also has a local SIM card and it that has just about two gigs of data left. Would anybody be interested in buying this phone from me?

 I'm looking to see if there are laid back, cheap beer, cheap simple mixed drinks, beach bars, not clubs, I don't want DJs or raves or anything like that and are they in close proximity to the main resorts?
 I love sitting feet in the sand having a local beer with good conversation.

Then suddenly a vietnamese older guy walked into the restaurant and just come up to us and started talking. I could not make out what he was saying. he mumbled a lot to the point I wasn't sure if he was even vietnamese. I am vietnamese so i would be able to understand if he wanted something from us. But he especially looked at my husband and told me something. Then he sat down next to us on the other table and kept on talking to us. Finally I can hear what he was saying and he kept mumbling how my husband has to learn vietnamese to communicate. He had this painful, almost angry expression on his face. He seems offended my husband doesn't speak vietnamese somehow. 
 The staff finally came over and asked him to leave. She was alone so she didn't know how to handle the situation. I asked her about him and she said he seems drunk and not from around the neighborhood. 
 Does this happened to any of you? didn't know how to react, was uncomfortable during and after it. he stayed for at least 10mins just talk and talk and talk... so very weird

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi:
 I'm seeing a lady that mentioned she loves Vietnamese Fish Sauce. We're both Americans living in Northern California. 
 I'd like to surprise her. Some (I'm sorry, very, very basic) questions.
 - Is there a good fish sauce flavored snack like chips or crackers I could find for her? I'm in Northern California and there are Vietnamese (or at least large Asian) supermarkets. 
 - If I bought her a bottle of fish sauce for her kitchen is there anything likely to be in an American kitchen she could pair it with? Any brands you'd suggest? Is fish sauce something you pretty much need to make yourself?
 - If I stop by a local Vietnamese restaurant, what could I order (and it wouldn't surprise if the answer is 'anything') that would have a lot of fish sauce? Spring rolls?
 ​
 Any help is appreciated!!!
 cảm ơn (looked it up!)

 So I'm planning a trip to SE Asia in a few months, and was wondering what the situation is like for public restrooms in Vietnam? It's been over 20ish years since I last came to VN and I don't remember what it was like then (was visiting friends and their families, and we were mostly in rural areas).
 Now that I'm older and a little more sensitive in terms of food, I'm concerned with eating something that won't sit well and I'll need to run to the bathroom or something.
 I'm already planning to pack things like napkins, antibiotics, anti-diarrheals, and other stomach whatever medicine, but just wanted to hear from others what to expect!
 For reference, going to Saigon and Ha Noi for this trip. They're big tourist cities, so I'm assuming it shouldn't be a big issue but I understand I shouldn't assume.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought a few of these Kirkland's convertible from Costco in Canada and love it. I gifted a few to my dad and he loves it too. Ironically the label says "Made in Vietnam" but I had never seen anything like this before and all my attempts to look for one here haven't been successful yet. What I want to look for:
  
Same material. After wearing these I can't go back to jeans anymore!
 
The zip convertible is convenient in rainy season.
 
The attached belt and lots of pockets.
 
I'm a bit big (bellied 😣) for Vietnamese, usually I wear Vietnamese 3XL or Canadian M-L. It's a bit difficult to find big sizes here.
 
 I can buy in HCMC or order online. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other night my partner and I were having dinner on P. Mã Mây in Hanoi when two local dudes starting attacking another local dude. Large machetes, axes, and sword like instruments were produced. The parties started swinging them at each other. We were a bit taken back because of the time, only 07:00pm, and it was in a semi busy tourist area. It was literally across from a very popular tattoo place. 
 My partner and I got out of there pretty quick smart, but we’re pretty surprised/shocked that this kind of thing happened in a popular street. While both of us have witnessed this kind of violence in our home country (aus), we just weren’t sure what the normal thing to do in Hanoi would be? In Australia, the incident would have incited loads of media and police attention/investigation.
 We kinda just played the ‘eyes shut’ game and didn’t tell anyone about it.
 Should we have reported the incident to local police? Is this a normal thing to happen in Hanoi and is it just underreported to tourists?

 👉The pros about Vietnam (good aspects) I like the landscape of Vietnam, some local food, and it's somehow easy to connect with the locals (especially in Saigon). I can agree that Viet offers low cost of living if you are willing to lower your standards tremendously and if you enjoy living in low quality housing and eat street food while sitting on baby chairs with the knees up in your face. Viet is not as stressful as the west (west meaning west north Europe, north America). It's also fairly easy to get your papers done if you open your wallet 💰💵.

 The Hindu festivals of Diwali and Navaratri are celebrated by Vietnamese people.
 In India, Maha Shivaratri is a significant Hindu festival observed in honor of Lord Shiva. On this day devotees of Lord Shiva, observe a day-long fast, remain awake all night, and perform puja to celebrate the auspicious occasion of Maha Shivratri.

I saw that Loan Châu, the Trúc sisters (Trúc Lam & Trúc Linh), & Như Loan are often criticized for their voices, but I would like to hear your thoughts. Who do you think is the worst singer on PBN?

And because of the past you know that stuff will never go away. More recently exceptionalism has manifested through promotion of cultural aspects. Best food, best scenery, friendliest people ! Humble my ass. Why learn about any other culture or move anywhere right ? Vietnam's the place to be type shit. Most people just love the country, they dont think we're the chosen people or anything, it's more so the attitude online and the media sometimes that bug tf out of me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I am flying soon from South Korea to Vietnam and from Vietnam to Bali. I only have 2h to make it to next plane from Vietnam to Bali. Does any one know if using Vietjet air for both flights I need to do check in again in the Vietnam airport changing flights? Or can they do check in when I am taking first flight for both flights? I am worried not to make it to next flight if I need to do check in again, plus I would need to get visa to enter Vietnam.

 Does anyone know the name of this exact remix of Khong Phai at 25:02 in this DJ set? https://youtu.be/i9mCWpytHfA?t=1502 
 I hope it's not a remix by the DJ themselves. I've been listening to this set a lot and it's definitely my favourite part! 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am quite worried. Please help.
 I’m a dual-citizen: Armenian and American. I arrived into Laos today from Thailand with my Armenian passport and I had a visa for it. The border patrol rejected my entry because they wanted me to get into Laos using my American passport given that I got Thai entry/exit stamps in that passport. So I had to reapply with a visa on arrival using my American passport. This caught me by surprise because I’ve switched my passport several times while visiting countries and it has never been a problem.
 AND I’m going to Vietnam in 2 days and I have a visa approval for Vietnam under my Armenian passport again. A worker at Laos’ immigration said it’s fine if I enter Vietnam and that the rules are different but I want to be sure. Vietnamese consulates in Laos are closed for the weekend and I can’t get help from anyone. Does anyone have more information about this? Does Vietnam allow passport swapping?
 Note: there’s no visa on arrival for Armenians or Americans.

 - Is there a nightlife?
 - Are there many gyms? I wanted to look into learning mixed martial arts...any options there?

 Overall, what should I expect? Thanks!

The people were great, everyone had a huge "togetherness" spirit when COVID started.. Now.... I absolutely hate it. Everyone, every day, is trying to screw each other over. Old people are vile and rude as fuck, acting like a bunch of gorillas. Everyone has an agenda. Companies are dishonest. People try to kill you on the road and act cowardly when confronted. When I came here, I was on TV talking about how great Vietnam is, but I've never in my life been tricked, lied to or screwed over as much as here. I am deeply depressed and miserable. HOWEVER, I am trying to reconnect with the reasons why I loved this place. One last ditch effort to regain happiness here.. maybe some of you can help me re-ignite that spark again. What is it that you like about living here? EDIT: I've been here 3 years

An alternative option for me would be to send my documents to the embassy by post, but I would prefer to do the process in person if possible.

So im looking for an apartment or room (with her own kitchen and good enough privacy) in the southern half of the city. If the location is near centers in Phú Lâm, Bình Tân, Hùng Vương, Him Lam, Nguyễn Cư Trinh or Phú Mỹ Hưng thatd be ideal. Her budget is 12 million per month and that hopefully covers everything she needs to worry about rent-wise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not think the news was already posted here, but the Michelin Guide is coming in Vietnam. First edition of the guide will be released in June.
 I think it’s a great think for Vietnam – It will help a lot the restaurants aiming to offer fine dining especially Vietnamese ones.
 What are your prognostics about the potential decorated restaurant in Vietnam?
 My opinion:
 - No 3 Stars Restaurants. I really do not think any venue in Vietnam is there yet. Bangkok does not have any 3 Stars Restaurants.
 - Anan Saigon: I really see them decorated. I tried them few years ago it was great, but it seems what they offer now is more elaborated. It’s the only restaurant in Vietnam that made to Asia’s Top 50 + their food relates a lot to Vietnam
 - I also think that the Guide will give one Star to a good Street food stall / place either in Ha Noi or HCMC. The guide did that both in Thailand (Jay bee) and Singapore. It’s a way for them to not appear too snobbish and it’s good PR…
 - Maybe one or two high end French Restaurants from Ho Chi Minh City: I have tried 3 Gourmands / La Villa / P’tit Saigon / Le Corto. All of them are great but I guess inspectors of the guide have been eating a lot in “similar” restaurants. I am just not sure if they will be "good enough" to get one Stars with French Cuisine. I could also add La Badiane in Ha Noi to this list.
 - One or more Japanese Restaurant? Likely – There is so many great Japanese Restaurant both in Hanoi et HCMC. I have just not tried enough of them to have an any name in mind.
 For the locals not familiar with how the Guide works ( I have seen many mistakes both on Facebook and local news sites) we wrote this article: https://amthuchiendai.vn/tat-ca-nhung-gi-can-biet-ve-cam-nang-michelin/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, quick question! I’m traveling in Vietnam right now and am currently in Hoi An. I’m supposed to fly out on the 4th to Hanoi and stay there until the 7th.
 I’m dumb and didn’t realize the 4th is the lunar festival and that Hoi An will be having lanterns float out! Is it worth it to change my dates and lose one day in Hanoi to see this festival? 
 Advice is appreciated :)

Have heard that Hoi An is a bit of a tourist trap in this regard and wondering if there are better tailors for the same price in the other cities. Looking to spend between $150-$250 USD for suits. Anyone got any recommendations/tips? Cheers!

 Any recommended Ha Long Bay cruise companies? Im looking for luxury cruises. No budget. I already looked into Genesis and Athena. Please let me know your experiences.
 Is it recommended to stay in Cat Ba for a few nights? or Ha Long? or Hanoi? I plan to do a 2 night cruise starting my second day, so ill have 2 nights to burn. I'm looking to do some exploring but mostly want to relax. Ill most likely be flying out of Hanoi.
 Thanks for any/all advice given!

 To put it simply, I am currently filing taxes for 2022 and it asks for my marital status in which I understand that I should put Married but am unsure which type of Married filing I should put, whether separately, jointly or head of household.
 I am also working on papers to bring my wife to the US, so I don't know if picking one of these choices is more beneficial than the other. Although, I do know that filing jointly is much more difficult and may take time to obtain certain papers.
 She does not have an income if that matters.

 A local internet service provider reported Monday that the Intra Asia (IA) cable has been encountering problems since last Saturday. There was a breakage at a cable section located about 130 km from a shoreline station in Singapore, causing a total loss of international data from Vietnam to Singapore through the IA cable.
 The latest breakage means that only one undersea cable connecting Vietnam globally, the SMW3, remains fully functional.

 (Total is 1 billion vnd/ Roughly 40k USD)
 I recently asked about it and their replies were a bit vague.
 I've heard some bad stories about VK and locals ripping them off.
 In your opinion how trustworthy are Vietnamese locals? What are the chances they run off with it in your opinion?
 50%? 5%?

I’m currently using an app called Mondly, and have complete all the free stuff but now need to pay for more, so wanted to check if there was a better one before I paid. 
 Or should I be less lazy and just create my own learning cards/prompts and study the language that way?
 Thanks in advance
 Edit: I will be living in HCM so southern dialect

 8 P. Hàng Dầu, Ly Thai To, Hoàn Kiếm, Hà Nội
 I tried viewing from Google maps but seems they haven’t updated since 2014 lol I hope I haven’t picked a bad time to visit!

Would I miss much by only doing that? I would be happy to do a 1/2 hrs boat tour in the bay, but all I see are expensive cruises taking a lot of time-or you know some? Any advice/link appreciated!

  People drink at a Highlands Coffee shop in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Y'all can check out more number here: Many Vietnamese spend more on drinks than main meals: report - VnExpress International 
 Another 33% of respondents are willing to spend VND20,000-40,000 on drinks, according to the survey of 3,940 consumers conducted by food and beverage market solutions firm iPOS.
 Only 14% said they would splurge more than VND70,000 for a drink, the equivalent of the price of a drink at high-end coffee shops such as Starbucks and Runam Bistro, it added.
 Nearly 54% of respondents said they visit coffee shops once to twice a month.
 I believe that the avg. hour rate in Vietnam is less than 25,000 VNĐ. How could they spend over 3 hours of working daily for a coffee?

I am planning on heading to Vietnam in the second half of August and am desperate to travel on the Ha Giang Loop but not on a motorbike and also not someone else taking me. I am a very capable cyclist but I was basically wondering if it was possible and safe? I would be happy to make it a large proportion of the trip so if there would be any safer potentially longer routes/roads? And where would be a good place to hire or purchase a good quality bike ( may be cheaper just buying) but would rather hire? I understand this is not the usual way to do the loop but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much

Lived in Thailand for seven years so hanging out on backpacker walking streets the majority of my nights there isnt something I wanna do, I'll go and check it out for a bit but I'm getting a tad bit old for all night drinking sessions with pounding music but I'm also not looking for HiSo speakeasy places where I have to get dressed up lol Oddly specific question I know, was just wondering if there are areas like that, small beer bars with a pool table and the like. Dont really care if there are ladies or not, that's not my objective but if there are it wont bother me either and faux british pubs aren't really my thing either lol. Thanks for any suggestions

 I'm Vietnamese-American (28F) and have visited my family in Việt Nam several times. But, the last time I visited was in 2016. My husband and I are planning a long vacation in Việt Nam late summer this year and I was wondering what street fashion for young adults in their 20s is like now, for both men and women. My husband is white so he's going to stand out no matter what, so I'm not worried about looking like I am a "local", but am really just interested in how street fashion has changed since I last visited and what is commonplace now. 
 In college, I met an exchange student from Việt Nam and when he saw me wearing short running shorts, he was appalled and asked why I was wearing those. I was confused why he was so shocked and he said in Việt Nam, only prostitutes wear shorts that short (they were like...mid-thigh length). This was back in 2014, though... I have no idea how accurate that reaction was to what's commonplace though because I've never been there long enough to really notice or outside of my family's district to see much else. 
 Cảm ơn nhiều!

 Hello! 
 Back in December, my airpods were stolen in Da Nang. Since I was flying out the same day, I couldn't do much and went my way. 
 Today, I got a ping on Find My app with the exact address. They are in Phuoc Ninh, Hai Châu, Da Nang. 
 What are my options to recover them? Would the police take this seriously? 
 They were my first gift to my would be fiance, so the emotional value matters a lot more than the financial value.

 Last year I went to Thailand and the subreddit r/Thailandtourism helped me a lot because I could look I could look up a lot of stuff and ask questions. It seems like there is no equivalent subreddit for traveling Vietnam, is there a site which a lot of people use that I just don't know of? Or is traveling through Vietnam that much rarer and information is not sought after?
 It feels like I just don't know a very obvious site/forum...

 Planning to do a 3/4 day Ha Giang Loop tour with an easy rider (can’t ride a motorbike, and honestly some parts of the route looks hella dangerous for someone w no experience). Saw lots of different tour groups, and most of them (Jasmine Hostel, Ha Giang Road Trip, QTmotors) seem to have pretty good reviews, making it kind of hard to choose between them. Could someone recommend me a suitable one based on these criteria?
 (1) Can arrange for transport back and forth from Hanoi (2) Experienced, heavy focus on safety (3) Really just a personal preference, but would prefer one with less of a ‘party’ vibe. Saw lots of videos with HUGE groups that are kind of loud and wild at night, and honestly I’d just like one with more of a chill vibe/ a smaller group (4) I don’t mind spending more, but lower prices would be great!
 Also, is there a big difference in the weather in end April and middle of May? 
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: I’ll be doing this in End April/May :) do PM me if you’re planning to go there too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for insights on the following;
 I am considering to move from Europe to HCM with my GF(Vietnamese). I've visited the city few times and absolutely love it. However, I would like to know how is the worklife in Vietnam (e.g. working style, hours)? Obviously companies are not the same - is there a large difference when working in a Western company and local?
 My concern comes from previous experience, when I was working in a Chinese company, and did not find the working style to be suitable for me. I felt that there was not enough freedom to conduct work within the strict corporate hierarchy. Also, had too much unnecessary work (internal processes), which requires constant overtime. Are Chinese and Vietnamese working styles similar or different?
 I'm currently working in senior management, and I'm not able to speak Vietnamese.
 All comments highly appreciated!
 Tldr: planning to move to Vietnam, would like to know more about the worklife

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, My parents are both Vietnamese immigrants who immigrated after 1975. I was born in Canada. I went to Vietnam on a tourist visa, however, the process is long and arduous. As I read on the Vietnamese Embassy in Canada’s website, a child of Vietnamese citizens could get exempt from a visa. However, as my parents both have Canadian passports, I don’t think this is feasible, but would ask if in any way I could be exempt from a visa or maybe claim Vietnamese citizenship from my parents. Thank you!

I'm good with an afternoon cave trip, or an afternoon guided hike, but more than that would be overwhelming for me. Is it still worth visiting if my priorities are soaking up the landscape, eating good food, and taking photos no one will ever see?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing against the Kinh, but I'm looking for something that feels a bit different, since I already live in the country. Usually when you go to the more diverse provinces (Lào Cai, Hà Giang, ...), the hotels are all run by Kinh people. I once asked a hotelier in Sapa about this and he said 'they [referring to Hmong/Dao] don't know how to run businesses', which was amusingly direct.
 Anyway, any good recommendations in scenic areas in the far North? I would love to fall asleep to the sound of a different language (Hmong, Dao, Tày, anything really) being spoken by the proprietor's family. Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm from Malaysia, I just got back from Vietnam, Saigon, few days ago during Chinese New Year, it was my first time being in Vietnam.
 The people there were super friendly, compare to the other neighbouring SEA countries, I would dare say THE MOST friendly and interactive people, I actually felt welcomed. Food was amazing, the street food blew my mind, I ate banh mi twice a day, daily and never got sick of it. Never got to try pho but I had bun bo hue and others which I don't knkw what it was, I just pointed the picture, nod and bow a little cause I felt bad that I couldn't speak Vietnamese.
 My mistake was not knowing that Vietnamese was celebrating Lunar New Year and most shops were closed for 3 to 4 days and we didnt get to see, eat most of the food we wanted to try, experience the culture, went to vung tau on the 4th day instead, wrong choice I would say because I think the locals went there for holiday or went back to their hometown, that's my assumption, so the traffic was pretty heavy but it was a fun.
 I should have gone there on the 5th day of Lunar New Year/Chinese New Year but all and all, it was an amazing place, fell in love with Vietnam just like how I fell in love with Japan when I first visited it, Extremely friendly, yes I can't express enough the friendliness of the Vietnamese
 My next trip is to visit Hanoi, any recommendations of place to visit? Food to try or anything that the locals usually enjoy
 Thank you, from your neighbour, Malaysia

I will be travelling for the very first time to Hanoi and i am planning to get an apartment there for a whole month, but I am very undecided about where to stay. I don't drive and usually walk everywhere, I've been told I should stay in Tay Ho and it looks great for walking, but I am also wondering whether for a first trip it would be better to stay in Old Quarter? As I would like to also have access to the buses / trains to do trips to Halong Bay / Sapa etc.
 I've actually eyed an apartment which is exactly in between Tay Ho and Old Quarter, near the Tran Quoc Pagoda. Google Maps says it's a 25-30 minutes walk in either direction which i normally would not mind at all, but I've heard horror stories about the traffic in Hanoi so I am wondering whether this is doable or not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the last time I actually watched it was 2020 but even before that I did not even pay attention to the show at all. There were way too many ads and the contents were not that good. I understand what they tried to refer to but I don't appreciate them much (mostly because the way they make jokes about events of the year do not solve anything and for me, normalizes all that shits); and yah, I do not find their jokes or "deep".
 BUT, I understand why some like it and that's great for them.
 What I am quite puzzled about is that some would go all the ways to look down on all those who don't like the show. Some would even make remarks and insults others over this.
 So please educate me, is there any thing else about the show that makes it "sacred"? or is it just some people being too close-minded?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everything, I'm thinking of doing the Ha Giang loop on a motorbike in north Vietnam in the next couple of weeks. Originally I was thinking of doing it without a guide, because I want the freedom to explore and maybe do some hiking. However, talking to a few people has made me think it might be better to do it guided, most likely with Jasmine Hostel. Does anyone here have experience with the pros and cons of each? 
 Personally I like the idea of doing it without a guide because I have more freedom to stop and take pictures, explore off the beaten path, do some hiking, and stay longer than 3 nights if I want to. The pros of doing it guided is the social aspect, staying at the best homestays, and the guides knowing the best views and all that. 
 Any feedback or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks I'm advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I figured I'd put this here as it is more of a specialist recipe compared to the scope of a more generalist subreddit like r/cooking, and the Vietnamese food subs are not exactly what could be called active or even semi active. 
 So I have seen various Vietnamese style grilled eel recipes (example: Chargrilled eel in lemongrass and turmeric (luon nuong xa) recipe : SBS Food) that are very much tickling my fancy. I've thought up a cooking method that sounds to me like it would give good results, but it's not something I have ever seen suggested anywhere else so I have no idea whether it would work.
 Specifically, what I am thinking about is pre-cooking the eel before grilling it by poaching in nuoc cham, and then finishing on the grill. What I hope to accomplish with this is: 
 -Getting flavor throughout the eel without having to worry about prematurely denaturing the proteins by using the nuoc cham as the poaching liquid. The lime juice in nuoc cham would do that if the eel was raw, but would not if it was just the cooking liquid because the eel would be cooked before denaturing could happen.
 I also intend to pierce the eel with a fork to get even more flavor throughout, if need be.
 -Setting the stage for a caramelized, crispy finish. The sugars in nuoc cham would be all over the meat and allow for good caramelization.
 As I said though I've never seen this suggested before, so I have troubleshooting questions. Specifically:
 -My primary question: will poaching in nuoc cham make the eel TOO strongly flavored? I like my food a bit more strongly seasoned than most, but as nuoc cham is so strong, I would be cautious about overflavoring here.
 -Would the sugar content end up to more rapid burning than expected when finishing on the grill? I absolutely abhor burnt food so a heads up warning if it is a fine line would be much appreciated.
 Thank you so much and I can't wait to branch out to this area of Vietnam's cuisine!

 She goes by Tam so I’m not sure if the vietnamese passport just had a different given name format from the usual American passport

We've roughly planned to spend 10 - 14 days in Vietnam before heading to phuket (probably flying out of Hanoi). It's only my second ever overseas trip, I just have no idea how to go about it. Out of convenience (we will have suitcases) I've planned to stay roughly a week in Ho Chi Minh, explore the surroundings then fly to Hanoi and stay there roughly a week and explore surroundings. I'm just not sure if this is the right way to go about it, I feel like we would be missing out on a lot of stuff if we are just sticking around the main cities. Would it be better to just spend a few days in Ho Chi Minh then head north a few hours each day by car and stay somewhere new every night or every couple of nights? I'd love any suggestions on some good accomodation, sights to see and just any must do activities while in Vietnam. We love all natural wonders such as mountains, national parks, rivers ect but also want to have some time just exploring and hanging out in the cities and experiencing some night life. Taking all suggestions into consideration and any rough itineraries are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I'm going to finally visit Vietnam right in the beginning of May. I'm planning to spend about 2 weeks in the country, starting from the north and making my way down to Ho Chi Min city and than flying back home. 
 I was wondering how bad would the weather be? I understand it's the wet season and not the optimal time to visit but that's my only option, unfortunately. Is it still a viable option at that time of the year?
 Thank you all very much!

I recently posted about assessing the value of a house but after some initial negotiations with the family in Vietnam, I might need legal representation to get the the proper amount that I’m owed by law. 
 My Vietnamese isn’t good so I can’t do a very good job finding and talking to one. Plus I don’t know if there’s an bar association I can use to verify accreditation. 
 Would love to get your thoughts and suggestions. 
 Thank you!

We met years ago and have been dating for a few years before we got married, and I have finally just dropped everything and moved to Vietnam to be with her. I’m still working on my bachelors degree, but I have a couple years of experience as a professional Vietnamese-English interpreter. I desperately need a job and it has been hard to find something so far. If anyone knows a local job that would work, or even a US based job that I can do remotely, I’d really appreciate it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Viet Kieu living in Vietnam at the moment, and part of several Facebook groups of women, including single women. I'm seeing more and more women decided to skip matching with white foreigners on dating apps like Bumble. Members in the group share "sexual escapades" by white foreigners in Thailand, which recently tighten their immigration policies, and cause a lot of them to "flee" to other SEA countries like Vietnam. Bald white guys in their 30s are the most obvious skip for these girls, and they are well informed of the LBH that are here on working visas. The language barrier is also another issue they mention, where it's exhausting to use Google translate for every little thing. Many of them share stories of them being coerced into sex by these men, even on first date.
 I'm not really surprised to hear all these stories from Viet girls in both Saigon and Hanoi, and I also translate and share a few of these creeps' posts from reddit on Facebook. Ever since the pandemic Viet people seem to be more wary of white foreigners (they seem more receptive to Koreans and other Asians)
 Of course, some of the more malicious girls like to take these naive foreigners on a wild ride with expensive dates then ditch them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnamese American here, I'm doing research on all the different fox spirits across asia and while China, Japan, and Korea's nine tailed foxes seem to have plenty of sources online that I can look at, there's barely any for vietnam's, and my best source thus far for the ho ly tinh has been wikipedia but even its wikipedia page says that it needs more citations and more reliable resources. So I wanted to ask here to see what y'all know about it and preferably if you could also point me in the direction of any sources(preferred is english because I don't know how to read or type vietnamese but I can make do with google translate.) 
 I also wanted to ask how people in vietnam generally view the creature.
 In China and Japan they range from pure evil, to harmless pranksters, to very kind and benevolent beings.
 In Korea, they are seen as purely malevolent creatures
 So I wanted to know how Vietnam generally views them. Do they range from being good to evil? Or are they just evil?
 What powers do they have, generally speaking?
 And the most important one is, how do they get their many tails? Is it just through age? Or do they do something special to get their tails? 
 I've wanted to reconnect with my culture now and I want to do it with my life long passion for mythology. Thank you in advance for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dumb question but I am extremely puzzled. All the toilets here have a bidet for washing ones ass after taking a dump. They are manual bidets - basically a garden hose to spray up ones rectum. However, this can't remove everything cleanly. I've gotten around this by carrying tissues with me and doing a combination of the bidet and paper wipes. Are people just sitting on the toilet and spraying nonstop until everything is cleaned? Are people just walking around with chocolate fudge in their rectums all day? I need to know!

 He escaped after the fall of South Vietnam and is thinking of returning but is afraid of the government sending him to jail or give him a hard time.
 Any advice from all people would be great, thanks.
 Also happy tet!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved to Hanoi last summer and honestly I’ve had a terrible experience, I was sexually assaulted in the first week of arriving and I’m still dealing with the police beaurocracy regarding that. Had a breakup of my 2 year relationship, with the person I moved over to Vietnam with and subsequently lost my job due to needing time off to process that. In addition to these personal things, the pollution bothers me and I still haven’t yet mastered driving a motorbike because I had a pretty nasty crash which has put me off for the time being. 
 In my head I’m imagining a move to HCM to be much better, I previously lived in Shanghai and I do prefer the feeling of a big metropolis - but I guess the problems with traffic are even worse there? I’ve struggled to find contemporary art and music events, and it seems like there is more of that type of thing in HCM. 
 Or do I have completely the wrong idea? Should I move somewhere else entirely? I can’t feasibly leave Vietnam for another year because I really need to make back the money I spent on document legalisation etc to get here 
 Thanks for your help!
