        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! A friend and I are going to be in Hanoi for 10 days in July, and we were planning on spending 5 days in Hanoi, a day trip to Ninh Binh and the last 3 nights in Ha Long Bay, but we've been seeing threads on how Ha Long is deserted and there's no point in staying the night there.
 Can someone please provide some clarity on whether this is true and too much time in Ha Long? Taking an overnight cruise is a little outside our budget so we're not keen on that, especially given that one of us is prone to seasickness. Would it be better to spend a couple of days elsewhere in the north? If yes, where should we be going?

Nguyên nhân khiến mình áp lực và thất vọng có lẽ là vì mình đã làm "vua chột trong xứ mù quá lâu" và được bạn bè, thầy cô, cha mẹ cho là giỏi suốt những năm đi học mãi tới sau này mình mới nhận ra điều này, Mình mới dùng reddit vì cũng chả biết chia sẻ với ai nữa. Em biết điểm số bây giờ không còn quan trọng nữa nhưng em vẫn thấy khó chịu ấy ạ, kiểu trước giờ luôn nghĩ mình có một cái gì đặc biệt nhưng thực ra lại rất bình thường và khi nhận ra điều đó làm em khó chấp nhận ấy ạ.

 Guy came up to me on the street with his scooter and started talking to me, picking me as Australian. Told me he has family in Australia and telling me all about them. Asked if I'd like to get a drink with him, which I was happy to do!
 Spent some time drinking with him, during which time he told me his family were visiting and they were having a big party. When it was time to go, he asked if I'd buy a bottle of wine for their party, which I agreed to do. He took me about a 10min ride away to a shop to buy wine, which cost 900,000 dong and then took me back to where we met. I realised at the time the wine was very expensive but I was a little drunk and didn't know where I was exactly so I didn't protest. I assume he just takes the wine back and splits the profits with the shop! 
 While we were drinking he took my email, I assume he'll try and have me send money for something else, but should I watch out for anything else? 
 Thanks for any advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, 
 In Vietnam for 9 days and trying to get from Ha Long Bay to Hoi An. What‘s the best mode of travel? Is a sleeper bus too mad? Will the trains be too long and too much of a nightmare? We would just fly from Hanoi but it seems a shame not to see more of the country from the road / track. Or maybe that’s us being too romantic!
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm going to Vietnam this august, and I would like to know if there is something similar to pocketwifi? I used it in Japan, it's a device you could rent in the airport and that gives you wifi. It's more pratical than a sim card I think, so if there is somerhing similar thanks to let me know!

I decided to go to the immigration department tomorrow to sort out my overstaying issue and hopefully also be able to extend my stay in hanoi for another 2 months. I came here as a foreigner alone for my summer vacation and I am afraid that because of this I might not be able to go back to my home country. Any advice on what should i do? I have asked around and some people say to just overstay for 2-3 months until you are fully recovered and pay a fine. while some say i should get to the immigration department as soon as possible even if it is difficult for me to move. I am really scared as I am alone and do not speak vietnamese.

This was at a bar on Saigons Bui Vien walking street. My wallet only had a few hundred thousand dong and a bank card that I canceled as soon as I noticed my wallet was gone. The bar staff told me to go to the police the following morning because they stop operating at 10pm. 
 I didn’t bother going to the police because it would be a waste of everyone’s time for such a small crime. But is this the truth? Or was the staff telling me this so that the police would not come to the bar and ruin the party?

 I have spent three days on chat to apple, dodo and vietnamobile, NOBODY is accepting responsibility, each company tells me it is the others responsibility

 TO ADD: So many of you have been so helpful, thankyou
 ​
 For the one who called me a troll and a luddite and illiterate, really unkind and unecessary to attack a stranger who has spent days trying to resolve this and been told different answers by Apple, and 3 different carriers / telcos. So yes, it is frustrating and stressful, and being called an idiot and a troll online is not helpful or kind.

 my wife and I are flying to Vietnam (for the first time ever) in October and we are not certain how to distribute the days among the different travel destinations and I was hoping you could help us a bit.
 We have a total of 15 days, including arrival on 22.10.2023 in Ho Chi Minh City at 07:35am and departure from Ha Noi at 11:30pm, and we are planning to fly to Da Nang to visit this city and Hoi An before we catch our next flight to Ha Noi.
 From Ha Noi, we would like to take the 3days/2nigts cruise to Ha Long Bay (or maybe Lan Ha Bay) and spend the remaining days in Ha Noi before flying home again.
 Our current plan is as follows:
 Arrival in HMC on Sunday, 21.10.2023 at 07:35am (Vietnam Airlines, already booked)
 Arrival in Da Nang on Wednesday, 25.10.2023 at 09:40pm (Bamboo Ai…]]></summary>

 I am unfamiliar with Vietnam laws and would like to know more if possible please.
 There is a YouTube account owned by an individual that is believed to live in Vietnam. This individual post fake animal rescue videos. If you’re unfamiliar with this, the “rescuer” puts an animal in danger,harms, or injures the animal and then proceeds to record them being rescued for views and donations. 
 Their accounts are BA Animals Care Media and BAC. Both post the same content and are owned by the same person. Please do not view their videos as it will gain popularity that way. Instead report it to YouTube. 
 My questions are, are there any animal rights in Vietnam? Does authority take animal cruelty seriously? 
 I’ve reached out to a few rescue groups in Vietnam I found on google. I’m hoping they could help. But I would be grateful for any and all insight into this. 
 Thank you!

(Contact info below) Just finished my food tour with her and she’s the sweetest kindest human and she took us to 8 different places and it was amazing. Holes in the wall you wouldn’t consider. Down alleyways up three flights of stairs to hidden spots. We have dietary restrictions (my husband doesn’t eat pork, which is tough here because 90% of food in Vietnam is based around pork and I’m mostly vegetarian) and she was able to accommodate us and still make the tour authentic and true to Hanoian culture and food. Her English was great and she was easy to talk to and get along with. She really deserves the shout out and recognition. We looked around for food tours and I saw someone mention her on here and I found her via Airbnb. But here’s her direct contact: +84 165 768 6004

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think for the most part, people in Vietnam are quite laidback and friendly. Why does it change so much when people are driving? A large number of people just turn into selfish assholes as soon as they're in control of a vehicle. Car drivers seem to consider the possibility of slowing down or giving way an insult to their ego. Bike drivers pay little attention to any kind of rules unless they're being watched by police. They'll drive the wrong way, break red lights, use sidewalks, pay zero attention to other traffic and refuse to stop at junctions. Buses and trucks only seem to have an accelerator and a horn. Everybody seems to be in a massive rush to get somewhere, yet when they arrive they just nonchalantly wander around like NPCs. 
 What's actually going on? I'm aware it's not everyone and you see plenty of people patiently waiting in traffic while those around them mount the sidewalk, but the sheer number of people that act like assholes on the road is way higher than in other countries. I don't think it just infrastructure because it happens even when the infrastructure is good. I also see people blame lack of education or poor people from the countryside, but you can cross the border into Laos and it's totally different experience

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me, the tones of Tiếng Bắc and Tiếng Nam sound the same for the most part, save for dấu hỏi and ngã. However, I noticed that the tones of Tiếng Huế sound vastly different from the first two: dấu sắc is lower rather than higher and sounds more like dấu hỏi, and dấu huyền is higher instead of slightly lower, but not as high as a typical dấu sắc. A few days ago I asked a Chinese friend what the four tones in Chinese sounded like, and I realized that they sounded very similar to Tiếng Huế’s tones. Dấu huyền of Tiếng Huế sounds like the falling tone of Chinese and dấu sắc sounds like the rising tone. I can’t speak for whether dấu hỏi/ngã sounds like the down-up tone, as I do not know what hỏi/ngã sounds like in Tiếng Huế. Why do Tiếng Huế’s tones sound similar to the Chinese tones? I’m guessing because Huế was the old capital of Việt Nam, most likely where most of the nobles/elites resided. Being a noble probably meant you probably had be able to speak in Mandarin and write in Chữ Hán/Nom, which likely had an influence on how they spoke Vietnamese. Can anyone confirm my theory?

 https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/general-jean-de-lattre-de-tassigny-vs-general-westmoreland.182885/
 I'mt not as into Vietnam as other wars but after stumbling into that article in link above I am now inquisitive.
 People far more familiar with Vietnamese history than I am especially those who read on the French Indochina War and later the American Vietnam War, whats your take? Is General De Lattre a much better general than Westmoreland was like OP claims in the link with his gigantic paragraph of details? I'm seeking a balanced view since the poster at Alternate History Forum is obviously super biased.
 I have heard of De Lattre prior to reading the article as one of the most famous French generals of the Second World. I also have seen documentaries that stated Westmoreland was an artillery officer during the War too. So they were obviously both contemporaries. But I didn't know much more than that prior to reading the article.

 You can get basically anything they sell for much cheaper in tons of other places (even online with delivery within 2 hours).
 Don't shop like a tourist... You guys are the reason their prices remain so unrealistic, you're letting them scam you with every purchase.
 Edit: I'm so happy to see everyone agrees! Much smarter people here than in that foodies group 😂

 It inspires me to finally start my own brand but in Vietnam instead. The market seems to be stronger for local brands. Google isn’t the most helpful as it seems to push Vietnamese manufacturers to sell in North America. Does anyone have any contacts or an idea on where I can start to find manufacturers or designers?

I have a job lined up there with a fairly decent school but with all the news lately of the Pollution issues and the biggest one being the rolling blackouts, I am not so sure it’s a good idea now.

I'm looking for a film that might not be well-known outside the country's borders. Perhaps it's a film everyone knows, and is hugely popular only to Vietnamese audiences, even if it wasn't popular with critics. Or maybe it's a film that wasn't well-received by audiences or critics, but has gained a cult following in the years since its release. Any suggestions would be most welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The news that Vietnam will have 70 Michelin Guide honored restaurants in 2023 is encouraging and long overdue. Vietnam's unique culinary traditions, blending multiple regional styles with influences from China and France, produce some of the world's most iconic and delicious dishes.
 From pho to banh mi, spring rolls to imperial court cuisine, Vietnamese food withstands comparison with the finest culinary traditions anywhere. The creativity, skill and passion of Vietnamese chefs across the country have produced cooking that has long deserved global renown.
 Having 70 Michelin-reviewed establishments will help showcase the diversity and quality of Vietnam's dynamic restaurant scene to an international audience. It will attract more food tourists, boosting the hospitality industry and local economies. Most importantly, it provides deserved recognition for the craftsmanship and dedicated hard work of Vietnamese chefs over generations.
 As a Vietnamese, I have long taken for granted the pleasures of Vietnam's cuisine. But global acknowledgement from prestigious groups like Michelin will be a source of pride for Vietnamese people everywhere. It demonstrates that our culture's softest power - our food - can compete on the world stage. I hope this is just the beginning and that more Vietnamese culinary masters will have their talents spotlighted in the years to come.
 Vietnamese restaurants have earned their place amongst the finest in the world. I hope the Michelin Guide and other international reviewers will help spread the word and introduce more people to the joys of Vietnamese gastronomy. Our chefs deserve this honor - now it's time for the world to feast their eyes and taste buds on what Vietnam has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in and out of Vietnam quite a bit over the past year for work. I've been using Zalo to communicate to my driver and team members when I'm back at my apartment / out of the office (I don't have Facebook, so this was a good alternative while out here).
 Unfortunately, I had to replace my phone last time and Zalo put me through some loops to basically "re authenticate" me by having someone already in my Zalo contacts confirm it's me. Naturally, that happened a few days before I flew back out here, so I was unable to get in touch with anyone when I landed (didn't realize this was needed until I landed). I eventually got hold of someone and they did the in-person verification.
 However, ever since then, the Zalo app keeps telling me I need to "verify" my account. It has an option to upload a photo of your passport but it doesn't seem to like an American passport. Do I need to verify? How do I do this? Anyone have experience making it work?
 I tried to chat with Zalo support but they only would message me in Vietnamese. I really only use this to keep in touch with my team, does verify even matter?

 I am planning another out of country trip to Mexico in a few months as well and need my passport - in order to renew by mail you must send in your passport and I am worried it won't get back in time for my trip to Mexico. I don't want to send it after MX because there are so many delays with passports right now due to covid. Will it be fine?

 Quán Phở Chay anh Hải. Hole in the wall breakfast pho place. Super. 
 Bun Cha Ta Hanoi. Fried spring roll bun (#6) is yum. Sit upstairs with shoes off. Fun.
 Katze Vegan & Vegetarian. What a cool story and hard working dude. Pricier food, but quality is top. And variety is great. Banana blossom salad, yes please.
 Bánh mì chay Vegan. Cool faux meat options. Really good.
 Banhmi LongHoi. Chay version is yum. Sit all the way up top and people watch.

 Phan Thi Kim Puc the girl in this photograph was 8 years old living in a small village in 1972 when it was shot. Doctors did not really give a chance to her looking at the severe burns on her body. However extensive surgery helped her to come through the ordeal. She later did her medicine in Cuba , where she met her future husband Bui Huy Toan. The couple later migrated to Canada , where they settled near Toronto. In 1997 she set up the Kim Phuc Foundation to help child victims of war. Truly remarkable lady.

 I am considering doing the ha giang loop on the back of an easy rider on my upcoming trip. Two main concerns I have are:
  
Is the weather in the region suitable for the tour during August?
 
I asked the tour guide people if a 130kg (im a big guy) person would be suitable to ride on these bikes with an easy rider, and they said “130 should be fine”
 
 Should?!
 I fully understand if I’m not able to go but that kind of animosity scares me haha. Should I ask again? is it too risky? 
 I would appreciate responses, thank you!!

 Is there anywhere that does vegetarian twists on these Vietnamese classics?
 Aslo open to suggestions for good veggie friendly restaurants or dishes that can be found anywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is mostly aimed at people living in Hanoi and the surrounding provinces. 
 As some of you may know, there is a power shortage that will continue throughout June. The official word is that power cuts will be occuring daily due to "El Nino". 
 Over the past week or so, my district (Long Bien) has experienced 5 outages that last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours at a time. We're told about them in the morning, so there isn't much time to plan around them as they start at 8 AM. 
 Tonight, we've been told (officially) that the outages will occur each day for the next month. In my 9 years living in Hanoi, I've never experienced this before, yes, occasionally power will cut during a typhoon, but never like this. 
 Does anyone else who is currently going through this have a backup generator? Is it worth investing in one? My wife and I run our business from home and we need to be online 24/7. We can't be out of the house for too long as we have 2 dogs that only pee outside and our son comes home for lunch and a nap each day. 
 Need advice on how to deal with it. Can't move because we own our property. Should I buy a generator? Have you heard any information about the power cuts that might shed more light than our building's manager has already? Do you know someone who works in the energy sector that has mentioned it to you? Feeling absolutely helpess RN.

But talking about some beliefs, they say that Our Lady made an apparition in La Vang 17/August/1798, what I particularly believe, as a Catholic. I'm not here to discuss religion itself, but I'd like to know your thoughts on that and, if someone has a picture/statue/icon, a photo of it (please 😀)

We are into nightlife, we party, close daytime social areas to meet people, make new friends, hit the gym, convenient parks to walk the dogs, prefer near waterfront with a water view, good mix of Việt and foreigners. Where do we look to live? We currently live in Hanoi on the lake, next to a park, lots of people gather and meet. We would love something similar. Places we have seen on listing that intrique us: Icon 56 building D2 Sanwah Pearl Golden River looks nice but no dogs. Suggestions welcome
 We want a mix of social, access to everything we want to buy, not overpriced but we aren't cheap, unique, where we can easily meet like singles and couples.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I will be doing a 3-week travel to Vietnam from south to north. 
 Major locations: HCMC, Mékong Delta, Hoi An, Ninh Binh, Ha Long Bay, Ba Be park, Bao Lac, Meo Vac, Quan Ba, others in the north, Hanoi.
 I am not sure whether to take malaria tablets. I am rather risk averse when it comes to health. Could you please advise on this? 
 Thanks!

I have a friend that met me in Vietnam to do a bike trip from Hanoi to Saigon within 3 weeks and was wondering if there are places that we would be able to go to in Vietnam that have games like NHL or smite to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was out in the beer streets of Hanoi and literally ran into 5-6 “sexpats” in just a few hours, just openly hanging out with ladies of the night on the streets. They were all talking about how they rent apartments here for peanuts, and simply eat Bahn Mis and plow fresh young Vietnamese chicks on the daily.
 One guy buys like 100 pills of viagra and uses them all in under two months. He’s a lawyer and just has a broker who sends him up fresh meat multiple times a day.
 To be honest, it was kind of repulsive to hear about all this. I’ve been having a great time with the locals and it’s kind of nuts how all these women are getting used and abused by westerners. What do local Vietnamese think about this? They seem to be happy with throwing their daughters to the viagra popping wolves of the west.

 Mọi thứ cứ trôi qua êm đẹp như vậy, đi làm kiếm tiền như bao người. Cho đến khi vợ tôi nghỉ công tác tại ngân hàng M… Việc này làm tôi khá khủng hoảng về tinh thần khi làm ca kíp về và liên tục bị trì triết, phàn nàn về nhiều thứ. Và vợ tự sinh ra cái suy nghĩ nghỉ làm thành gánh nặng của tôi, mặc dù tôi cũng rất tán thành việc nghỉ nếu công việc quá áp lực và không hiệu quả về kinh tế. 
 Tôi chả biết do nghiệp hay duyên làm tôi có quen được 1 chị tiếp viên hơn tôi 3 tuổi vào đúng thời gian này. Không ai chủ động, chỉ nói chuyện về công việc rồi chia sẻ về cuộc sống, dần rà sau 1 tháng điều gì đến sẽ đến. Vâng, tôi có cãi nhau với vợ và rủ chị kia đi Hạ Long chơi và có qhtd. Ban đầu mục đích của tôi chỉ là giải toả căng thẳng, bằng một cách thần cmn kỳ xong chị ta yêu tôi. Rồi ngày qua ngày, việc chị ta cứ chia sẻ công việc (cùng ngành) mua đồ, quan tâm đến tôi cũng làm tôi có chút rung động :)
 Thực sự việc này tôi đã biết là sai ngay từ lúc rủ chị ta đi Hạ Long, tôi cũng vẫn rất yêu vợ mình chứ. Nhưng bản tính tham lam và râm tục của tôi làm tôi vẫn muốn giữ mối quan hệ này :( Chị ta cũng biết tôi có vợ và vẫn chấp nhận làm người thứ 3… Sau khi chia sẻ những lời này thì tôi vẫn đang có một gia đình đáng yêu và vẫn duy trì mqh ngoài luồng. Tôi sai rồi!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My parents and the older generation of my family, those who immigrated to the US, have always said that American and Western foods are always too salty or too sweet. They always say that too much salt or sugar is used. They also say this is why American food is so unhealthy.
 I’ve mainly been raised up in the US and eat both Asian and Western cuisines but never found this to be true. I’ve always found most foods to be reasonably seasoned to my tastes. I’ve asked friends and family around my age, and they also generally agree with me. I also believe the whole “American food is unhealthy” myth to be untrue because that really only applies to fast food which you really don’t eat on a daily basis. It’s also a huge over generalization of American cuisine considering how diverse each region and state is. I digress though. Is it really true that Vietnamese/Asian cuisine use less salt/sugar and are healthier than American/Western cuisine, or is this more of a subjective to taste thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m returning to Vietnam from Australia next week! Last year I spent a month travelling your beautiful country, but this time I’m spending 2 weeks in Saigon. 
 I’m looking to see if there is any sort of Hip Hop scene in Saigon? Have it be gigs, shops, painters, dancers, rappers and singer, anything really. I’m a street artist here in Australia and found a bit of a scene last year in Hanoi, so surely there is something going in in Saigon. 
 Also, looking to go and see some good live music, both traditional and if there is any contemporary gigs. I’ve found the opera which will be great to go to. But I’m open to anything really! Also if there is any race scene at all? I’ve found a few clubs that have potential like Arcan. 
 Thanks in advanced everyone. I’m so excited to be back in Vietnam next week!!!

 I actually got along really well with my girl, and we talked quite a bit (a lot of it using google translate). After everything was said and done, I was gathering my belongings, I asked her what she recommended I do for fun in Hanoi. On google translate she said, "I don't know, I only stay here" and she had kind of a weird look on her face.
 It was kind of strange, like she just looked at me for a moment, the continued dressing me. 
 What do you think that meant?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! :) Basically, I'm creating this ARG (alternate reality game) and in it, I'm trying to create this Vietnamese person who is essentially the main character. Mainly I need help with the name. I'm trying to come up with a name that would utilize the Vietnamese word for descent; the name would be made by splitting up the word into syllables that could then be used to create a full name (ex: like the word danger being used to create the name daniel criminger). Unfortunately, I do not know a lick of Vietnamese. 
 I'm struggling with two things: 
 A) I'd like to be able to find a correct translation of the Vietnamese word for descent. I've tried a bunch of websites including Google Translate and ChatGPT and they all come up with different answers and 
 B) I'd like to be able to come up with a realistic name, something that actually sounds believable, if that makes sense. I'm sorry if it's a large request but any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

 Now, I’m trying to book hotels, and I want a very nice 4 or 5 star hotel in a modern area of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. 
 I’m looking for hotels similar to jw Marriott (Hanoi), they’re fully booked for my dates so any similar will do. And if anyone can recommend me anything for Ho Chi Minh I’d be grateful!

 My wife’s bà nội died suddenly, we won’t be able to make it to Vietnam in time for the funeral. 
 She’s already burned some incense at our tiny shrine. But she’s not practising and does this stuff more out of habit than anything else.
 What could I do on the day of the funeral to mark my respect? I was thinking to print a picture of her and get a small bouquet of white lilies and putting them on the shrine. Is that appropriate?

 EDIT: Some people are asking how this relates to r/vietnam, I just wanted some more Việt Kiều/mainlander perspectives to see if there’s something I’m missing in navigating this mess. 
 We had seen the first one together and they enjoyed it, so I thought they might like this. But they clearly didn’t, and even talked badly about it during the movie. EDIT: It was too artsy and chaotic for them. Too much going on.
 It’s okay if they didn’t like it since we are worlds apart when it comes to media consumption. I just hate that they didn’t at least stay and experience the movie with me and my brother. It had been a while since we had gone out to the movie theaters as a family.
 To make it worse, my brother is very hot tempered and told them to shut up several times while they were critiquing the movie, and even as they were walking out. I get where his frustration is coming from, but I don’t agree with how disrespectful he was. 
 They waited for us outside in the car. On the ride home, I tried to keep the conversation light even if I was slightly annoyed. 
 But the tension was clear. And when they confronted my brother about snapping at them, they all started yelling at each other. 
 We just got home and there was a lot of door slamming. I feel really sad. If I had known the evening would end this way, I would have just gone to see the movie myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 👋 My boyfriend and I are working on applying to jobs in Vietnam, starting this week. Before we do this, we are sorting out our CVs and cover letters.
 I am a qualified English teacher with a 4-year Education degree specializing in English language. I have 6 years of experience in the industry.
 My boyfriend is a graphic designer and photographer and holds a 3-year bachelor degree in the above field, he has a 180-hour TEFL course certification and has 7 years experience. 
 He is designing our CVs from scratch, to suit our specific aesthetic wants. I have some questions regarding what Vietnamese schools might look for in a CV/what is considered professional:
 • He is holding a chihuahua in his head shot, it is a professional and very striking photo. Would this be considered strange to a Vietnamese recruiter?
 • My CV is working with a colour palette of pink and grey, are there better colours I could choose that recruiters might find more appealing or make my CV stand out more?
 • What are some specific categories in CVs that recruiters look at?
 • Is there any way we can strengthen our chances/make our CVs stand out from the rest?
 Thank you so much, this subreddit is a godsend.

 Sex outside marriage with a local is illegal in Vietnam. How is the law enforced? If you live in an upscale apartment with security and bring a guest. . . they try to stop you? Notify the police? Blackmail you with the entrance camara footage????
 Porn is illegal in Vietnam. How do they even enforce that? Customs confiscates your devices for a thorough inspection? The government tracks your internet activity?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, we live in US and want to get married in Vietnam(I am originally from Vietnam). We are in process of finalizing our wedding location. Assuming guests can make it, what is recommended location for December wedding? 
  
Cost: Will the wedding cost similar at both locations? Assuming similar type of venue and decoration. 
 
Weather: preferably we want outdoor wedding. From our initial search, it may rain in DaNang in December? 
 
Venue availability in December: DaNang seem to be busy with tourists during December 
 
 Main reason for considering DaNang/ Hoi An is half of the guests are non Vietnamese and these locations are unique to Vietnam. Since they are traveling to Vietnam, and may not travel again in future DaNang/ Hoi An has more cultural and tourist things todo. We might be wrong, but we don’t see something similar in or nearby Ho Chi Minh City. We would like your opinion/ suggestions.

 I'm travelling through vietnam right now and I was looking for advice from some viet natives. I am solo travelling and just can't seem to meet people and have remotely lengthy conversations. I keep trying but it doesn't seem to be working. I'm currently in hanoi (old quarter). I've been walking around all day, searching online and trying to find events or language exchange communities. Looking online everyone seems to be saying its super easy to meet people here so I don't know why I'm struggling. I am usually very confident talking to people back home, but it seems this language barrier is impeding me more than others.
 Any advice would be much appreciated as I'm a very social person and tend to be far happier when with people.

 I am looking for a way to travel from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi by bus.
 I searched for buses on google through baolau, vexere, and sinhtourist, but none of them go directly from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi.
 The only way I can find is to get off in Da Nang or Hue and then book a new ticket.
 I've seen information that Mailinh Express runs this route, but when I look it up on their website, it says there are no buses.
 Can someone tell me how to get from Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi directly without any transfers?
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have always been fascinated with words, etymology, origin of things. I would like to make a list of borrowed words or even words that sound like each other but also have the same meaning. Please contribute if you think you know something!
 Borrowed words:
 Beer = Bia
 Lane = Làn
 Auto = Ôtô
 Burger = Bơ gơ
 ‐------------------------------ 
 Words with similar sound, not borrowed but coincidentally same meaning?
 Đất = Dirt
 Tối nay = Tonight
 Vệ sinh = WC (French would sound like Vê Xê)
 Cut = Cắt
 Yes = dạ (Ja in German)
 Count = Cộng (which is to add)
 ‐------------------------------
 Other interesting translations (and shortened):
 England (Anglo) = Anh
 Spanish (His-pan-ia) = (tây) Ban Nha
 Italy = Ý
 Ra-(men) = Mì (or Miến)
 Pain (French for bread)= Banh
 Gants (French for gloves) = găng tay
 [Think Gauntlets for English]
 Cream = Kem
 Carrot = Cà Rốt
 Curry = Cà Ri
 Beef = Bò (French for Boeuf)
 Chicken = Gà (Latin for Gallinae)
 Taxi (driver) = Tài Xế
 Chocolate = Socola
 Valise (French for Suitcase = Va Li
 Chemise = Áo Sơ Mi
 Fromage (French for cheese) = Phô Mai
 Toa lét = Toilettes (French) 
 Cát xê = Cachet (French) 
 Pê đan = Pedal
 Please chime in add your own I would appreciate it !!!! Thank you!!!

 If anyone knows of any gyms where expats go or are used to training expats that would be great.
 Im also open to regular boxing. So if anyone knows any good expat gyms that do that too, I'd love to hear it

  Also, my roof has been leaking. I have a bucket to collect most of the water, but I need to empty it and mop the floor every time it rains. I've been asking them to fix it for a month or reduce my rent but now I just want to leave. 
 I pay too much for this to be my reality. I only moved here because it was pet friendly, but my cat died 2 months ago. I'm off work for one month and would like to move while I have time, but they will not break my contact without keeping my security deposit, even if I feel the spirit of my contract is broken. How do I break the lease and get my money back so I can move? Am I shit out of luck? Cheers thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I've heard that the installlation fee, maintenance fee, operation fee of having Air Conditioners (AC) in some western countries costs an arm and leg. And people in some countries in Europe don't have AC at home, according to some of my friends in France, Spain and UK.
 Sales of portable air-conditioning units rose 2,420 percent in a week, British retailer Sainsbury’s said during the hot season last year. Some in Europe are coming to accept that some AC usage may be needed to save lives. After a heat wave killed an estimated 15,000 people in France in 2003, air conditioning was introduced to some nursing homes in a bid to protect the most vulnerable. 
 How do you guys feel about AC in Vietnam, where the prices are cheap and almost every household in urban cities like Hanoi or Saigon has at least one. AC in hot nation like Vietnam is true love or a threat to the environment?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Vietnamese passport expired a few years ago and I want to renew it. I looked it up on the NY consulate website and it looks like for expired passport renewal you basically have to apply for a new one. But the forms for that asks a lot about pre-immigration life such as where I lived, why I left, any and all relative information including their addresses, etc. And I don’t have all this information since I moved here when I was super young and I don’t know all my relatives especially their Vietnamese names and addresses. More importantly the forms are all in Vietnamese so I’m assuming I’d have to answer in Vietnamese but I don’t speak/read/write Vietnamese. I’ve tried calling the NY consulate but haven’t gotten through to them. Looking for any advice to make this process easier

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am vietnamese but have been in the states for 15 years. I havent been back. I am travelling to HCM and Hanoi with my partner in couple of weeks. We are comfortable with ourselves in term of PDA in cities in the states, but I am afraid we would be stared and verbally attacked. I do speak the language so the shaming may scare me. 
 My partner is from Hungary and we received that treatment when we visited the country. I do want to show him the beauty and food culture in Vietnam, yet not wanting to run into any trouble just because we are both men.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Saturday morning we arrive in Hanoi airport. We need to transfer to our hotel in Tam Coc. Hotel has quoted us a private SUV at a cost of 1.500k. Is that reasonable? The other thing I was wondering was whether I could just book a grab from the airport to our hotel in Tam Coc or is that going to be a trip most won't take?
 ​
 Thanks.

 I'm currently looking for a teaching job in Vietnam, i sent my application to some centers though while waiting i wanted to try applying for jobs on Facebook groups yet i felt like it could be risky. 
 Most offers there are "some locals" looking for teachers and not actual schools/centers, it seemed not legit to me but what i know is that everything works differently in Vietnam, right? 
 My question is, how legit are those offers? Is there anyone here that was hired this way through a local on facebook? 
 I would appreciate your help.

I would like to bring souvenirs for their children, and I'm wondering what items would make them happy. The children are a high school girl, an 8-year-old boy, and a 5-year-old boy. There is no budget limitation.
 I guess some fancy fountain pens could be good. Any suggestions? Thank you.

 Additional info:
 I do not intend to live yet to any country But I'm interested in GENERAL on how people live their lives as average people
 So a diverse answer is okay. Whenever you live in any city
 You can also give your personal range of cost of living as a person living by himself/herself
 I want to know or to be as grounded as possible on how natives live their life every day

 It’ll be one (25g) package only, amongst other personal stuff. It’ll be sent with dhl. It’ll be tobacco, not cigars or cigarettes.
 I read it’s allowed to import up to 250g but, it doesn’t say if that is allowed as well as a postal item. Experiences please?

 If I get serious with her, there are a few things I will want to discuss.
 One of them is her views on spanking children.
 Do most Vietnamese mothers spank?
 Growing up in the United States, it was one of those things that was usually considered private and only discussed with close friends so I honestly cannot even give an answer for how common it is in The United States (perhaps she will have a similar honest answer).
 In the United States, I would say that it about half and half (but that is only from my experience).

 I'm planning a journey for myself and husband. We're first-time travellers to Vietnam this year in late August / early September. Any tips for off the beaten track tours of 1 or 2 days on the Mekong Delta? We're used to road-trips and bumping into authentic experiences with people, a local guide in this case will probably give us insights we wouldn't otherwise have. I found something by Innoviet and Local-insider, but I still don't know if that is what we're looking for. Any tips will be much appreciated.

 Probably a long shot 
 I'm trying to find back a restaurant that I just loved when I was here the last time in 2018.
 It was right in front of the Lapis hotel on Tran Hung Dao (the avenue with all the embassies). Best banh xeo I've ever had + a bunch of other worthy dishes.
 Unexplainably now they put a fake teppanyaki fusion restaurant instead.
 I asked the girl at the entrance and she told me it might have moved to Le Duan Street - but I'm not sure if she actually understood that I was looking for that specific restaurant.
 Does anybody here know the name? 
 If not I'll take other good banh xeo suggestions too (in Hanoi)
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Viet Nam!
 Over the last year or two, I've been coming across articles about how major smartphone manufacturers have been increasingly shifting operations towards India and Viet Nam.
 As you know, China has been pretty much the "factory of the world" over the last 2 decades and her socioeconomic transformation has been astounding over the same period to say the least. Sadly, I was too young to pay attention then.
 Because of a rapidly aging population and diminishing workforce, cost of labour in China has risen exponentially. Coupled with constant, multi-front geopolitical tensions, one can understand why having operations in China faces a diminishing risk-reward ratio.
 Looking at Vietnam's Balance of Trade, I see that it's surged post-2015, around the time the protectionist Trump administration got elected - which I suppose accelerated the trend of de-coupling from China. However, the Vietnamese Dong seems to be facing a constant weakening, unlike that of an export hub. Somehow, I never see reports about how these winds are affecting regular Vietnamese citizens.
 Have you noticed a surge in manufacturing activity in Viet Nam?
 If so, how has this impacted you? 
 Has the surge been driven by MNCs setting up their own plants, or have they been subcontracting to local manufacturers?
 Also, have these factories been concentrated in particular regions and therefore limited in benefit?
 Do you think Viet Nam will experience the same breakneck growth in the next decade as China did?
 I'm excited to hear the perspectives of people living through the change!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a beach festival is going on now in Nha Trang. It's suppose to start on the 3rd of June (according to the receptionist), but they have already practicing from the 30th of May. I don't mind the noise if it's until 22:00, heck even 00:00 is fine. But it's 01:50 AM and those motherfuckers are still singing and blasting EXTREMELY LOUD music. Nobody was able to sleep. Many tourists and visitors are staying near the beach, around the area. There are many hotels. Many have toddlers that need to sleep early. Many have tours that start as early as 7am-8am in the morning.
 Tried to call the police for the noise pollution and they're useless. "Oops we can't do anything uwu" 😑. Heard a similar situation happened in Nha Trang during Tet as well. Is this only in Nha Trang specifically or does it occurred in other cities in Vietnam as well? 
 Update: The Khanh Hoa province posted this news today in the 31st of May, to remind everyone about the laws and rules.
 https://khanhhoa.gov.vn/vi/tin-tuc-noi-bat/phong-chong-vi-pham-phap-luat-trong-hoat-dong-van-hoa-the-thao-va-du-lich-3005
 Noise pollution is illegal in Vietnam and organisers have to follow the laws created by the Vietnam government. If laws are broken and not being followed, expecting some fine.
 "Kết quả, Thanh tra Bộ Văn hóa, Thể thao và Du lịch đã xử phạt vi phạm hành chính đối với 5 tổ chức, cá nhân có hành vi vi phạm với tổng số tiền xử phạt 340.000.000 đồng."

This will be my first time in South East Asia, so I’m looking for some recommendations for some less touristy places to see.

Would love to be able to do some hiking, and I’m also looking into the Ha Giang loop, but otherwise very open to suggestions.

In Da Lat some being attended with angry looks. In Nha Trang at the bus counter they even don’t want to sell me the tickets for my next destination and turning the face like I wasn’t there… at the hotel, the manager, was asking me if I taken something from the “minibar” ( literally 4 Pepsi cans ) 4 time in a row aggressively and threatening with checking the room…. Should I assume that’s the treatment that I’ll have all around the country? Of course there where people that wanted to help, but at the moment seems they are the minority… and please don’t read this as pointing fingers or in any bad way. As I said I just want to understand.

I don´t doubt, that the infos given by Tieng Viet Oi are wrong, because they´re native speakers, but maybe my book uses rules that they left out? I don´t know! Can you native speakers out there tell me, if this use of the pronouns makes any sense, or if my course book isn´t a good source?
 ​
 1.Dialogue:
 Person1, Stranger: calls other cô / Person2, stranger: calls other ông - formal setting
 2.Dialogue
 Person1, waiter: calls other bà / Person2, customer: calls other ông - restaurant order
 3.Dialogue
 Person1, knows other person, not closest friends: calls other anh / Person2, same as other: calls other chi (dot under i) - colloquial talk
 ​
 --> also the book explains the pronouns as:
 -cô: young women or women who aren´t married
 -ông: men older than 40 years
 -bà: elderly women or married women
 -anh/chi(dot): people you know and that are around your age
 ​
 (it doesn´t really consider the relationship between the speaker and the other person!)
 ​
 I´m sorry for the long post! I´d really appreciate any adivce, because I fell in love with the Vietnamese language and I just want to keep on studying! Thanks a lot and have a wonderful day!

Obviously that has all changed, all of our plans have been cancelled so essentially starting from scratch except for the flights from Europe to Asia. It’s 3 weeks so was planning Hanoi, Chiang Mai, Koh Samui and Hoi An. Honestly my main worry is that I could be days not talking to people and be lonely. I’m introverted as is my partner but we always had each other, we are very friendly but in short conversations normally. I’m a bit lost as to what to do and half considering just not going and losing the money on the flights and maybe doing shorter trips around Europe. From being in a relationship so long it’s almost like you lose confidence alone I think and rely on the other person.

We are aware that the school year starts around April but we would like to come sooner (Jan/Feb). We are considering volunteering through WorkAway for the first few months before trying to find jobs. We’re wondering how the visa process works: are we still only allowed to stay for 30 days on a tourist visa or is it possible to obtain an extended visa with the help of a host from WorkAway? Or will we have to do visa runs? Because we’re planning on finding jobs while in Vietnam, we’d also like to know what documents we’ll need to apply for jobs and obtain a long stay visa. We’d really appreciate any info and advise! TIA

The thing is, her family might not be too accepting of our relationship because they have super traditional views. Her family matters to her a lot, and I want to give them a good impression (or at least not a horrible one). 
 Any tips or suggestions on how I can approach this? Her family doesn't come from wealth, so I was thinking of giving a hundred or so USD dollars to each member of her close family (though I don't come from wealth either, a hundred goes a lot further over there than it does in the USA, and I thought it might be a good small amount), a couple nice gifts from America, and then of course showing respect and kindness at all times. 
 But to be honest, I'm not sure where to go from there. Is there anything I can do to make them really like me despite their traditional views? Or at least even out the scale of hate vs. like haha?

 Another thing I found unique about Vietnam is that these big signs show food names rather than business names. 
 This makes me wonder: are these signs designed and subsidised by some government agency? Was there a government program that made all food signs look similar to reach other?

 I’d like to do a special mother-in-law/son-in-law dance at the western reception, but it’s hard to find a suitable song. I want to find a song in Vietnamese for a slow dance that is appropriate coming from a son-in-law. Many songs about mothers talk about the mother raising the singer, which isn’t genuine to our relationship. I’m hoping to find a song whose lyrics work coming from me.
 Do you know of any sweet, heartfelt songs in Vietnamese that are about a mother-in-law? Or about a mother, but without focusing on how the mother raised the singer? Or a song about an amazing, strong person without any romantic subtext?
 My fiancée’s cousin helped me find Mẹ Yêu by Đỗ Phú Quí, which sounds perfect, but reading a translation of the lyrics, seems to focus too much on how the mother raised the singer. But maybe the sentiment would still work?
 Thank you for helping me make the day special for my (soon-to-be) mother-in-law!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My cousin and I are planning a trip to southeast Asia from mid-November thru early December. Most likely a November 14 departure and a December 3-4 return. We are both guys in our mid/late 20s from Los Angeles. We like nature (hiking + excursions), nature sightseeing, large cities, food, and partying.
 We were set on doing 2 weeks in Thailand but are now considering adding 4-5 days in Vietnam due to the recommendations of many family members & friends.
 Our initial plan was to do 3-5 days in Bangkok & Pattaya and then travel south for the remainder of the trip to see Phuket and Koh Phi Phi.
 So my main question is this: If we have 4-5 days, how would you recommend we spend it in Vietnam? Bangkok and Hanoi? Is it possible to truly experience these 2 major Vietnamese cities in that short of time? Should we omit one? Maybe reduce some of our time in Thailand?
 I understand there are dozens of great places we'll be missing... But I am hoping some seasoned travelers or residents of either country can give feedback/advice. It is MUCH appreciated!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Thanh Lam, Vietnam leads the world in cyber abuse to cheat and violate the law.
 At the Multi-Channel Management Networking Workshop on the morning of May 27 in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Nguyen Thanh Lam said:
 "For every 100 dong earned from cheating on YouTube, there are 55 dong of Vietnamese users. We are at the top of the list for copyright infringement. There is a football livestream channel that violates copyright like Xoi Lac TV. There is a channel that buys Japanese porn, cuts it into many short clips, and then packs it and sells it to the American audience."
 Lam said the country in second place in the ranking accounts for only 5% of fraudulent income, one-tenth of Vietnam. Last week, Apple also announced to remove more than 8,000 infringing applications originating in Vietnam, many of which are content creation applications.
 The deputy minister said that this is a sad record, exposing the fact that besides positive content, many creators still do business and make money regardless. Part of the responsibility lies with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook when they can't control the content and users on the platform. Advertisers also have a responsibility to still spend money on dirty content.
 "The state does not prevent businesses from wanting to advertise in cyberspace, but it is impossible for a money to flow into malicious content that businesses still see as normal," Mr. Lam said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 We are 3 girls planning a quick getaway trip to Hanoi and Cat Ba island from 28th September-2nd October. Unfortunately we are short on time and so we have planned this itinerary:
 ​
 - Land in Hanoi on 28th Morning, leave directly for Cat Ba, stay in a resort/hotel
 - Leave Cat Ba on 30th Morning, come back to Hanoi, get an AirBnB in/near Old Quarter
 - Checkout on 2nd morning and take the evening flight back to our country
 ​
 I read alot of posts on travelling to Hanoi/Vietnam and I am honestly with too much information and figured it would be better to ask here. Please help me out!
  
Is Cat Ba Island worth it? We wanted to avoid the crowd in Ha Long Bay, but stay near the sea and relax. 
 Any suggestions for Cat Ba, like places to eat/ things to do/ places to stay?
 Best way to travel from Hanoi to Cat Ba and back?
 For Hanoi, we have Egg Coffee, Bahn Mi (and a lot more food items) and Beer Street on our list already, but any hidden/hole in the wall places that are away from commercial tourism would be great to know. Very open to trying authentic vietnamese food and drinks!! 
 Any suggestions for a reputable spa experience in Cat Ba or Hanoi are most welcome
 Any suggestions for where to go for a party in Hanoi? We will be there during the weekend
  
Thank you for taking the time out to read this and so sorry if its a long post!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many of you, I am increasingly concerned by the hate and hostility that I see every day in this beautiful community, especially between Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans. 😔 
 It is my firm believe that in our time and age, nothing is more important than mutual respect and understanding. So, in this spirit, I propose a new Vietnamese flag that symbolizes the indestructible friendship between the North and South; a new flag free of bad connotations; a flag that combines the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam. 
 As we strive to foster stronger connections between Vietnamese wherever they may reside or what they believe, it is essential to have a symbol that represents our shared values of friendship and understanding; representing multiculturalism, love, diversity, respect and mutual understanding 🤝🌍

 This proposed flag aims to honor Vietnam's rich cultural heritage and traditions (blue) and emphasizes the significance of unity and cooperation (red). The Golden Star represents the everlasting bond between Vietnam's people and their striving for greatness and prosperity for all Vietnamese people, regardless of their geographical location or political stances.
 With my loving heart, I invite every one of you to print this flag out, show it to your parents and especially grandparents and display it proudly in your windows. Let's propagate the message of love and friendship. Because only as an undivided ONE we can overcome the hate that has tormented this beautiful land for far too long ❤️❤️❤️❤️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planning a trip to ho chi minh for 7 days. Is it way too long? Seems like you can travel the entire Vietnam for that time if you touch and go however it's my first time there and I don't want to stress myself out by taking a loooooong train or bus ride (I get motion sickness). The flight is already booked so we have to start and end at hcmc no matter what. 
 What do you recommend? Should I 
  
Take it easy and stay entire week in HCMC and go for day trips to cu chi and mekong delta etc
 
Travel to danang/hoi an via plane/train. Will it be too tiring to go there and back to hcmc in 7 days?
 
Spend the time in South Vietnam, going furthest to muine/nha trang?
 
 Or anything in between? 
 Also, are the roads super difficult to cross? I have huge anxiety about this and when I cross the road usually use traffic lights so I'm super unconfident.
 Also, I'm going in august.. read that it's the rainy season. Should I give up on seeing the beach entirely?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 Just curious what my options are for attempting to do this with my fiancé comfortably able to sit on the back (ideally able to strap a backpack to the back as well).
 5 years ago I drove from Hanoi to Saigon via motorbike (without a doubt the greatest travel experience of my life).
 But now I am coming back for a long honeymoon and what to do the Ha Giang Loop which I sadly missed last time around.
 I own a 1000cc motorcycle back home, and have obviously quite a bit of experience driving in Vietnam in previous trips. However, with a second person attached to the back this gets a bit trickier.
 I want something that will comfortable seat both of us for long stints of the drive, and ideally I want to rent this time and not purchase. What do you guys recommend?

Unfortunately, all the pictures of my father who passed away last year are on that SSD (except for some on Facebook). Do you have any recommendations for data recovery services in Hanoi?

 I am planning a 16 days trip to North and Central Vietnam this December. Flying into Hanoi and out from Da Nang. 
 I have shortlisted these places.
 Hanoi,
 Ha Long Bay,
 Sapa,
 Ninh Binh,
 Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park,
 Hue,
 Hoi An
 Da Nang.
 16 days is definately too short to visit them all yea? Which one should I miss if so.
 I love nature, history and culture but am also a budget traveler.
 Sorry if I posted at the wrong subreddit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Vietnam has been making strides in the world of technology and innovation. With the rise of start-ups and the increasing number of high-tech companies moving their branch offices to Vietnam, is there a possibility that Vietnam, this Southeast Asian nation, could become the next start-up nation in Asia?
 The shift from China to Vietnam has been noticeable, with companies such as Samsung, LG, and Intel all establishing a strong presence in Vietnam. This trend is not limited to just large corporations, as start-ups are also finding success in Vietnam's growing tech scene.
 One reason for Vietnam's appeal is its young and highly educated population. According to the World Bank, nearly 60% of Vietnam's population is under the age of 35, and the country boasts a literacy rate of over 95%. This has created a strong talent pool for tech companies to draw from.
 Another factor contributing to Vietnam's potential as a start-up nation is its favorable business environment. The Vietnamese government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurship. The country has also made significant improvements in infrastructure, including expanding its internet connectivity and investing in new technology parks.
 However, there are still challenges that Vietnam must overcome in order to fully realize its potential as a start-up nation. One major hurdle is the lack of venture capital funding available for start-ups. While the government has taken steps to address this issue, more needs to be done in order to attract investment and support the growth of new businesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I am making plans to visit Vietnam for the first time, landing in Hanoi and planning to spend around a month here. I would love to visit HCMC and do the hiang loop also.
 My concern is with the street dogs that I have seen online in the SEA countries especially in Thailand and I was wondering what the reality of the situation is in Vietnam.
 I am at the level where if I see a dog I will cross the road or go the other way.
 I’ve heard that pretending to pick up a rock and holding a stick / umbrella is good defence.
 Is it realistic for me to have a good time in Vietnam (especially if most my time will be on group tours and city) with the dog population?
 Mainly my fear is with dogs off lead and more so feral/wild/street dogs in packs.
 Thank you very much and apologies for the errors question, I know that dog phobia is not common and that most people love dogs - trust me I do too but I cannot lie about the reality that I fear dogs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I’m considering taking a morning bus form Sa pa to Noi bat airport in Hanoi to fly to my next destination (Da nang) The bus Leaves at 5:45 and arrives directly at the airport, scheduled to arrive at 10:50
 Now, as a first time traveler to vietnam, I will have never taken one of the buses there. Is a flight booked for 13:05 cutting it to close considering the possibility of delays? Would 14:00 be a safer bet? 
 Thank you!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been thinking about visiting Saigon/ HCM City this July (would be my first time in Vietnam) but I'm kinda worried about the humidity, the heat and the rain. 
 From what I've seen the weather seems to be more bearable than in Hanoi but I'm not quite sure in how far it would allow me to do sightseeing and stuff throughout the day.
 So I was wondering if someone could tell me about the personal experiences in Saigon around this time of year. Do tourists usually visit there in summer? Do public buildings, restaurants and trains have AC? Do locals spend time outside during the day or do they usually try to stay inside?
 Pretty much what I wanna know is if I'll be able to have a good time despite the warm weather and rain. I live in Europe and the climate here is quite different from SE Asia, so apologies if some of my questions come across as naive or uneducated. 
 Either way, I know there's no definitive answer to this, but any helpful advice is much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So there a Vietnamese channel that buy youtube ad service to promote recently and one of it famous video is about the YouTubers feed a cat that got chained. As many people said it kinda disturbing bc things like that in their country consider as animal abuse immediately but in VietNam it a dangerous environment in the city if you let your cat roam outside. Also about the physical interact that look like slap actually is a pat but Im not sure bc it a child hit💀. Cats can easily accident unalived by many reasons in my country but I not support thing like that, it just most necessary still depend on the owner and the situation.

 Does anyone know where I might find contact lens solution - anywhere in Ha Giang or Cao Bang?
 I am traveling via motorbike and need to find this ASAP as I’ve almost run out! I assumed pharmacies would carry it but that appears to be incorrect. 
 Is there a glasses shop/optometrist in any of the towns on the loop (I’m in Dong Van now), Ha Giang town, or in Cao Bang town maybe?? Google maps doesn’t show anything.. 
 Would be a stupid reason to cut my trip short! 😫

 Just wondering what was going on with that?
 PS. He threw the hat in front of the meter and I could still see the fare in the reflection of the windshield. It started off at 10k and rose very slowly. Then randomly jumped to 500k, 1 million before reaching 2 million by the end. The fare ended up being 41k on grab.

 I think this word means "horny dog" or something about being horny. However when I Google translate it says that it means thieves.
 Could someone confirm to me that "Dâm tặc" can mean horny? I'm not 100% sure if this is the word she use to call me, I just Googled how I think it was spelled and it came up.

 I have been living in Can Tho since 2011. The city once was really nice, but lately I feel unwelcome and uncomforable here. What I experienced this morning confirms my feelings the more.
 I work self-employed, so I can manage my time. Every morning I take a walk (actually, I want to jog, but the heat...). So I am walking down Nguyen Viet Hong, turn then into a small hem and come out at Le Lai. From there I need to cross the Pham Van Tri and enter the park (Luu Huu Phuoc). Easy. I've been doing it for a long time.
 This morning, when I approached the corner Le Lai/Pham Van Tri, a young Vietnamese, apparently agitated, was standing there. He threw with things onto the cars and motorbikes. I must have looked bewildered. …]]></summary>

 My co-worker (22 year-old Vietnamese woman who recently graduated from College) came up to me and gave me a $10 Starbucks card on my last day of work.
 I was surprised as her and I got along well when we worked together (but we rarely saw each other/rarely worked together as it is a big hotel).
 I am a 40-year old man and have had many jobs and this is the first time that a co-worker has done this. I think it is very nice.
 Her and I have contact on Linkedin.
 I don't mean to "keep score", but there is something nice that I would like to do for her. Suggestions?
 As an aside: At work I was busy and I never paid much attention to her. In looking back she was very hard working and kind. I have travelled to Japan, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Laos, South Korea, Malaysia and Kong Kong but for some reason I overlooked Vietnam. She got me thinking of Vietnam and I have since developed an interest in travelling there and have read many good things about Vietnamese women.
 Obviously I am not going to be in a relationship with her (not likely with any Vietnamese American for that matter: even in big/diverse cities the Vietnamese are likely less than 1% of the population and moving to Vietnam is not an option).
 Still nice to know that such people exist however.

 Are there other platforms (that operate/are based in Vietnam) that take international-based credit cards? I'm open to opening a bank account with international banks like HSBC if that helps. As mentioned in the title, I also have CCND and can open a Vietnamese-based bank account, but I'm not too sure how the process works.

 I'm thinking about taking the ~12 days guided motorcycle trip to Hanoi then flying back, that sounds simply amazing. But good alternatives would be spending some more time in the city and taking my time in the south instead. I love a good hike or some local culture and would hate to rush things.
 What would be your thoughts on how best to spend the time?

 I'm (33) Australian my wife (30) is Vietnamese lived here since 18 years old. We've been married for 6.5 years together for 10. 
 I've been to Vietnam many times and I love it, when we touch down in Saigon I start getting an almost 'coming home' vibe. My Viet language skills are actually not too bad, so I can get around by myself, order my own food, shopping, basic conversation. 
 Anyway, my in laws are coming here for a visit, it's winter so doing some of the really great Australian outdoor type activities, so we are gonna take them out for dinners, some shows etc. We have planned for a weekend away in a cottage in the countryside with some of my family. Now my in laws speak next to zero english, and my family speak no Viet. 
 I'm just wondering if anyone might have some suggestions for some good activities we could enjoy together without having to rely to heavily on my wife to translate constantly. Like some games or activities or board games etc. We can do while enjoying a couple of beers by the fireplace. Hopefully someone out there has some suggestions, I just want them to feel like they're participating with us rather than just observers.
 Thanks ☺️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just landed at in HCMC. Wanted to share some things I saw for foreigners in terms of how to get into town with zero stress taking a grab.
 1) Go through customs, Exit international terminal. Look for the green umbrella tents across the street. 100 yards max. cant miss them. 5-6 large green umbrellas. I dont ever remember seeing these before. 
 2) open grab and use the green umbrella area as your pick up spot.
 it should cost you 125k dong to get into D1. Grab will add 15k for the airport toll. Total bill should be about 140k + any surge. The driver pays the toll.
 Waiting for grab at 6am = 10 mins
 ride to D1 took 15-20 mins.
 Cost was 140k dong which is like 7 bux. and best was ZERO stress of being ripped. had 3-4 taxi guys approach and follow me to grab area.

 I was wanting to fly somewhere fun and interesting this winter for vacation and I was interested in visiting Vietnam for it's connection to Cold War history even after the Vietnam War.
 However, when looking at tickets for Vietnam through Expedia, I noticed that they aren't the cheapest.
 Being a college student on a budget, I was kind of curious if anyone here has a preferred airline they fly with when it comes to Vietnam whether it is to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City?
 Thanks in advance everyone!

I want to preface this by saying I undestand that eating dog meat is a cultural practice and that it is not too different from pigs and chickens (I am vegan and not here to judge). However, I would like to know how visible this trade is when visiting and how I could avoid seeing it. For reference, I will be going from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi and will be visiting other places along the way like Hoi An, Hue, and Phong Nha. Any advice and experiences would be appreciated. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foodie friend asked me to help ask around...
 La Maison 1888 is the French fine dining restaurant of Intercontinental Hotel Da Nang. This hotel is a 30 minute car ride away from the main beach because it is on the far end of the coast, and it does not allow Grab pickups out of the hotel. The restaurant is built into an old villa on a cliff, overlooking the water, and is very beautiful. They emphasize that they have the only 3 Michelin star French chef working there, and claim to be the #1 food destination in Vietnam. (Tasting menu is VND4-5M.)
 The advertising feels scammy because there is no such thing as a Michelin star chef. They claim the chef helped design the menu and he runs a 3 Michelin star restaurant in Paris, which is not the same thing and he is not in the Da Nang restaurant. Vietnam will only get Michelin rated retaurants in 2023, and only in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. There are very few blog reviews about the restaurant, and their TripAdvisor and Google Maps reviews do not imply that this is a legendary must try before you die place.
 Can Vietnam foodies comment?

 For the most part I am able to drive normally on the road but I find it so hard park in small narrow parking spaces, sometimes there are security men help me sometimes there are not, and in those times when there is no one to help, I have fallen 3 times due to sudden brake when the gas was still on (the place so narrow I was afraid I’m gonna hit objects so I hit brake too sudden) And now I am starting to feel a bit fearful of driving :(

 First of all I spent 6 weeks in Vietnam and absolutely loved it the people are emazing, countryside beautiful as well as amazing food. I would love to revisit and go to the parts I didn't have time to see. 
 Im posting on here because I'm looking for a friend I met on a night out in Hanoi on the 4th May called Patrick who is Swedish. I'm female from the UK, we had a great time when we met but we didn't get chance to exchange any contact details. I think he's still in Vietnam in HCMC, I'm now not. If you're on here hit me up, it would be nice to see what you are up to. Absolute long shot and very unlikely they are on here (I probably won't ever find him.) 
 (I'm not sure if this is allowed on here and I will delete if not. Before I get any hate I understand that there are hundreds and thousands of tourists in Vietnam. Just thought I'd see if I could reconnect)

 I asked some Vietnamese friends and one mentioned the pronunciation of "calendar and lavender" and the use of "ish" (ie 'the party starts at ten-ish'). I'm looking for more examples.

 Me: Born in late 1980s
 We immigrated to the USA in the mid 1990s and all became US citizens over the next 10-20 years. I'm trying to resolve a USA pension related issue for my parents and it has been a nightmare because they didn't keep copies of the forms that I need. Pretty much the only significant documentation I've gotten from them is my refugee card and my Certificate of Citizenship.
 I'm tried pretty much everything I can think of to prove their marriage status but unfortunately:
 1) They never owned property
 2) They don't have a copy of their last joint tax filing (which would be 2015 or 2016). I'm currently trying to track down where they filed their taxes to see if I can get a copy, I also plan to contact the IRS.
 3) Social Security doesn't have them listed as each other's spouses even though they did provide me with a form that said my dad would translate for his wife, which is my mom (WHAT THE FUCK)

 They've said I can do my internship whenever I want, so I can decide when I travel. I don't know if it's best to travel in June 12-30 and then do my internship, or in July (after my internship)..or if there will be any difference at all 
 was hoping I'd be able to hike in sa pa and phong nha. I know it's rainy season,, but I am not sure if this means absolutely no hiking or nature ever, or if it'll just vary day by day ?
 :) I'm excited to live in HCMC
 I'm super keen to spend some time in jungles too--i wanted to do this tour, https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-ba-deep-jungle-expedition/ but it's 2 grand ... Any tips ? If I find a tent and someone cool to come with me, ? 
 Would really appreciate Any advice/comments you have, and if you have any special places to recommend id be very very grateful :)
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something about malls/supermarkets in Vietnam that makes me feel like it's more interesting and luxurious. In the US they just feel mainstream and "I go there just to buy stuff" kind of feeling. In Vietnam going to a supermarket is like being on a fun trip. For example a trip to Coop Mart was a lot more fascinating than walking around in Walmart. Maybe because I was young and poor so memories were more fond?
 ** Ok so I'm probably wrong about the malls. But what about the supermarkets? Is it fair to compare Walmart, Target and Costco to Coop Mart and Lotte Mart?

Nên mình muốn hỏi đường nào đi an toàn và ít gặp xe to nhất. Mình nên đi khung giờ nào thì ít xe to nhất. Mình cũng không biết sửa xe, vậy trong trường hợp xe hư thì mình nên làm gì.

 This was my first time ever leaving the USA and to be honest, I didn’t know too much about Vietnam before taking the trip. I was really just looking forward to leaving the USA and experiencing a new spot on the globe, and the opportunity to go to VN just landed in my lap. I have to say, I was blown away by your country.

I was studying using pimsleur for learning Portuguese which I have a review here. I was studying that for 6 months and I think it helped me in learning vietnamese and made it quite a breeze. Listening to the audio, while writing down everything really helps for my learning and it's well paced. I recommend pimsleur for any viet kieus that never got around to learning vietnamese.

I know that China and Vietnam use to be on bad terms (might still be?) yet VietChinese people are so prevalent.

 Curious what the experience is like in Vietnam during Tết? To me it probably would be something cool and new since I never got to see it before.. but to my family over there they probably experienced it too many times already.

 Landed in Hanoi a few days ago and went for a full body Vietnamese massage at a parlor where the women were dressed up in everyday clothing. So I thought this massage was gonna be like in Thailand, and solely for muscle relaxation and recovery from walking.
 I turn on my back and massage was good, then all of a sudden I start to notice the lady spending a lot of time in my groin region. I thought i may have felt really tight there, so maybe she was working out some knots..
 I was wrong, I was getting aroused, and she knew as well. Then tells me she'll give me a good massage and motions for a "special" type of massage..
 There was NO intentions of me getting one, and I thought I was just getting a regular massage as I always have in Thailand.
 Anyone else have this happen?? It was pretty funny looking back at it, and still no "special massages" since being in Asia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Viet boyfriend and I (South Korean girl) have dated for a year. We’re at the same age (2000 kids). We studied abroad at the same uni in Canada. Last year, my parents came to Canada to attend my convocation. I introduced him to my parents, and they're really impressed with him bc of his family background, handsome face, height, education and graduation job (these things are very important in Korean culture), 
 Next month, he and I will travel to Vietnam for summer vacation and visit his parents in Hanoi. I wanna make them impressed just like he did on my mom and dad. 
 What can I do to impress his parents?Especially when I come to his family house, and we do not speak the same language. 
 Do old Viet people judge girls by their look, family background like Korean do? I’m quite confident but I don’t look like Viet girls.
 My Viet female friend say Hanoi parents are extremely conservative. Is that true?
 What gifts should I give to them? I have some high-end korean skincare products for his mom, but have no idea for his dad.
 Update: thank you guys for great suggestions. As I know from my Viet female friend, his parents are well off and live in a big mansion in Hanoi. That could mean they’re open minded like you guys commented. I’m confident in answering all questions regarding family background, I know rich Asian people care about these things. My dad also asked him about his dad’s job when we had dinner in Toronto. My boy has a brother who has a wife working as IELTS teacher. Both of them can speak English, so luckily I have more people to talk without translation and support me. So excited to come to 🇻🇳🇻🇳 for the first time

What is the best way to make sure my food will not have mollusks in it? I'd like to have some seafood. What things should I avoid and what should I say to someone to ask if the dish has mollusks in it? Thank you

 so as advice to all traveling to hcm airport, only book taxi from companies and issues receipt, but now a days vinasun and malinh counters or liason taxi handlers started to behave more like gangsters, that's why i started using taxi companies before the exit, looks like im running out of options, except to book grab or gojek

A few folks I met along the way had warned me about Hanoi. I had bought some donuts for 50k. I did not have any small change so I gave her 500k and asked for 450k back. She pretend to gave me an extra donut and move away so I asked for my change. She brought out her purse and said this was what I gave her (50k). I had to wait for another order from another vendor and by the time I went back to her, she had already disappeared! Just be careful and use small changes especially with street vendors!

 This past week I started getting diarrhea. Not in the ill, going multiple times a day way. But every morning I wake up a bit earlier than usual with the urge to go. And my stool is like water.
 Normal appetite, no cramps, no nausea, nothing. I’m vegetarian, so haven’t eaten any weird meats.
 The first night it started was after I did a caving tour. We used our guide’s water filter straw but that was it. Also, seems a bit fast for it to be related to that? Either way, I don’t know. Just a thought. 
 Otherwise I feel fine! Great energy. It’s just that my usual daily bowel movement is watery diarrhea.
 Suggestions?

I’m a little surprised as I expected Ha Long Bay to be super touristy with the classic backpacker scene, but have not seen another backpacker so far. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad thing, i’m just a little confused and wondered if another part of Ha Long Bay is where backpackers tend to go?

 I’m staying in HN for the next 2 months and want to connect with the Start Up and Digital Nomad community here. Do you have any recommendations where to meet people ? What platform do people here use to connect and network ? Where should I look for events or gatherings ? I’m thinking about visiting some co-working spaces, joining meetup.com events and search for FB-groups. I’m thankful for any info or tip.
 Have a great day people !

 I grew up on a farm in the midwest of the US, and I love animals. I actually think cows and pigs are just as smart and loving, if not more, than dogs, so I realized that I don't really have an issue eating dogs due to abuse because cows/pigs in the US are brutalized far more than dogs in vietnam (look up factory farming practices in the US if you don't believe me, it is truly an abomination).
 However, I'd like to "kill two birds with one stone", if you will. Can anyone recommend me a high quality restaurant (don't want to eat some street dog/cat or something) that serves both dog and cat? I would like to try both, but I don't want to go to two separate establishments to try.

 However, on Voz, I've seen some Vietnamese incorporate history into their viewpoint. Some people believe that modern Japanese people are "disgusting" because they are descended from bad people.
 I'm curious if any of the Vietnamese people here have similar thoughts. For example, should we be cautious around a Japanese person simply because they are Japanese?
 I don't ask this question just because. I'm about to start working for a Japanese company in Vietnam, and I don't want anything like this to get in my way.
