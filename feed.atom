        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm heading to Danang this December and hoping to try paragliding while I'm there. Can anyone suggest the best spots for paragliding that won't break the bank? The prices I've seen online are crazy – nearly $100 for one person! I'm sure the locals might have some better insights. It's more expensive than the 5-star hotel I'm staying at, which is pretty amusing! 😄
 Also, besides paragliding, I'd love recommendations for other fun activities in the area. Any local favorites or must-do experiences? Thanks a bunch!
 Edited: Moreover, Is this national park worth going with a tour guide or DIY should be fine? https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/11139-trekking-bach-ma-national-park-day-tour-hue/

 Firstly - it was absolutely magical: breathtaking views, wonderful local homestays, friendly locals & smiling children, and great food.
 Secondly: we were told it can't be done. We have no international driver's license. We were told nobody would rent to Americans. We were told laws were strict due to recent accidents and not to bother unless we did it via a group.
 For us - this all proved to be wrong. And because of these misperceptions - we didn't encounter a single American on our route (plenty of French/Chinese/Japanese/British/Australian/German people, though).

 Are there any tailors who are used to dealing with short, fat tourists?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading a book recently that claimed Pol Pot planned to invade South Vietnam, and essentially try to take Saigon before the North Vietnamese forces arrived and restore the Mekong to Cambodia, which nationalists there historically claim. It didn't happen because of how unexpectedly quickly the RVN forces fell to the North, although Cambodian forces did briefly take Phu Quoc after the fall of Saigon before being expelled. And then ultimately crushed in 1978 when the battle-hardened Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia. 
 It got me thinking about what would have happened if he had invaded the much weaker South Vietnam, assuming it hadn't collapsed so quickly. Could he have pushed through to Saigon? Would China, who preferred to have Vietnam divided, have provided more support? Any good sources or alternate history places to read more?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story: my mom (Viet Kieu with no Vietnamese CCCD) gave my grandmother money to buy land and a house. So we spent monies on buying that land and built a house. 
 My grandmother died, then transferred that land title to my Aunt. Now that my mom retired to Vietnam, she has CCCD and Ho Khau. 
 We asked Aunt say to transfer land back to my mom's name, she refused. She gave a lame excuse like "Oh, when I die, I will put you on the will paper, transferring the land to you. Don't worry nobody will live in your house". (She has the red book, it means she could easily sell the land and house right?) 
 My aunt is a 60 year old, childless, never married woman.
 I have a video recording of the aunt admitting that my grandma gifting the land to my mom, and the whole village (it's small) knows that we bought the land and house 15 years ago. I have many aunts and uncles and nighebours that can be the witness, if that means anything in court.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just took a trip to Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. One thing I noticed, particularly in shops, cafes and restaurants is that while in the other countries (even hyper expensive Singapore), buildings were usually an arctic blast the moment you walk in, a lot of places in Vietnam often only have 1 AC unit running, AC set to a high temperature or areas of the premises partitioned off for "cleaning".
 I also noticed they usually just open the windows in the morning in spite of the noise, heat and pollution, waiting till the heat was unbearable before finally shutting the windows and turning the AC on and would sometimes turn off the AC 30 minutes or more before closing time. Is it really that expensive to run AC in Vietnam? . . Disclaimer - before the "all police" chime in, obviously not all Vietnamese businesses are like this and I'm sure they do this in other countries too but that besides the point.

 It only takes 5 minutes to complete and I would love to hear some perspectives on this issue, as that number is really low compared to countries like Thailand or Indonesia.

I have this job offer at a kindergarten which should keep me busy during the day for the most part, so I basically have the evenings and the weekend for myself. Is there much to do there? How long does it take to get to HCMC if I want to spend the weekend there, I am also big into swimming, are there any swimming pools that you can subscribe to? Food options etc. I applied your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! When my Uncle served for the US Army in Vietman, he was stationed in Nha Trang. His experience was far different than so many other veterans - he had a pretty good life while he was there and has been back to visit, in fact. He managed to get into a relationship with a local woman named Diep (out of respect I am not posting her full name) which he still reminisces of fondly to this day. He yearns to know that she is okay.
 Pics: https://imgur.com/shBetbb https://imgur.com/QinNwTP 
 This is a shot in the dark but I wanted to at least let my Uncle know that I shared his story. I also realize that she and many others may have had a completely different perspective of things. Apologies ahead of time but this is about their relationship, nothing else. He is getting very old and this is one of the last things that he's never gotten closure on. If you know or knew this woman, enjoy the pictures. If you wish to share anything about her, please do. I'll share them with him.
 Thank you. Be well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, lying contemplatively, I suddenly sat and pondered about charity. I looked at it from a different perspective.
 If there were no charity missions, would the children there not know about the existence of better food, nicer clothes? Most people know that charity is often organized with groups going to remote areas for a few days, cooking, providing clothes, books, and supplies, and then everyone goes back home.
 The children/people in those areas get to eat 'okay' for a few meals, and then it goes back to reality as usual. So, does charity bring any meaning to the people there? Or is it a way for the children to see themselves as 'poor' compared to society? So, if there were no charity, or if they didn't go on social media to see others 'flexing', would their lives be less self-conscious?

However, there's no actual flight ticket anywhere to be found! The Vietjet website FAQ section seems to imply a second email with the tickets should've been sent out with the booking confirmation but I've never received this. If I use my booking number on the Vietjet website to retrieve my booking details it only shows me my flight itinerary, no ticket.
 Has anyone had this experience with Vietjet before? I know it's a budget airline and it's got it's money saving ways (read: scummery) but I'd still love to hear any advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I adjusted my travels to not end up in Huế when the floodwaters were up high, but some people have told me it’s now subsided.
 Can anyone in Huế give an update on the flooding today? Is the citadel area, northwest of the river, now dry? And are restaurants and markets operating normally?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào, 
 I come with a question and hope to get an answer because this is impacting my study. 
 While learning I notice some sayings would use “do la” vs “nay”. How do I differentiate when to use them? 
 Example: do la mot chiec vậy đẹp. that is a beautiful skirt. 
 Quyền sach nay đặt tiền. This book is expensive. 
 Ban co thích cứ a hang nay khong? Do you like this store? 
 So basically I’m asking when is it nay and do la. Is this just something to remember or is there a grammar vocabulary thing I should work on to help transition my learning. 
 Cảm ơn VN and Reddit ❤️

 But aside from my excitement, the beggining of March is also the start of Ramadan, holy month for us Muslims. Since I'll be fasting and all, I would like to know how Muslims are perceived by the rest of the Vietnamese population. I saw that there are a lot of mosques, but maybe people don't perceived it very well you know? So I rlly want to know from you guys! Thanks a lot!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone
 My friend and me were remniscing and joking today about our Vietnam trip that we made almost 10 years ago.
 During the discussion we came upon the subject of hearing those generic beats and basslines of those Vinahouse tracks being played loud af in random shops in Southern Vietnam.
 You know, these famous "DUN - DUH DUH DUH - DUN" beats. 😂
 And during the discussion, we asked ourselves if there is an actual original song or remix that started it all.
 In that article here...
 https://danangleisure.com/vinahouse-in-a-nutshell-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-it
 ... there is the mention of a remix of a song called “Tình phai” by DJ Hoàng Trọc and DJ Alan Tian, that apparently initiated the birth of the genre.
 I searched for that particular remix here and there, but I couldn't find anything.
 Does anyone know a hint or could point us to a specific song or remix? I am aware that Vinahouse songs are pretty much always just a silly remix of some other song, but there HAS TO BE ONE specific remix or track that started it all??
 I think of something like in that particular video here:
 https://youtu.be/_Zd46k_Z02M?si=5KbNSOsTXf-2l7oH
 Thanks to all you legends!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we're planning of travelling to Hanoi in December and doing an excursion to Hạ Long Bay area. We can plan to either do a 2 day 1 night cruise but typically these finish at midday and then travel back to Hanoi. Does anyone have any recommendations for trips that are 2 day 1 night but only travel back to Hanoi around 4/5 pm so make the most of the 2nd day? We are unable to do a 3 day 2 night trip as our flight is very early on the 3rd day.
 Alternatively does anyone know what cruises we can do that drop off at Cat Ba island on the 2nd day and we do our own thing before heading back to Hanoi? I believe the last boat/bus back is at 4pm, but please tell me if there are other later options for returning to Hanoi.
 Any any recommendations on if to do Lan Ha Bay/Cat ba island instead of Hạ Long Bay?

 ![img](i6pmivydq31c1 " ")
 Mới vụ gần đây có một tiktoker bị bóc phốt vì nói lớ tiếng việt. Căn bản là bạn này sinh ra ở Việt Nam nhưng sống ở Mỹ cũng được nhiều năm. Mới gần đây, bạn ấy có đăng một vài video trong đó bạn nói tiếng Việt có bị chậm. Không biết là ai ném đá trước nhưng sau một thời gian thì có nhiều Tiktoker khác bu vào chửi bới và khinh bỉ rằng OOP giả bộ không biết Tiếng Việt để tỏ vẻ Mỹ Trắng.
 Lúc đầu thì mình cũng ngỡ ngàng tại vì mình sống nước ngoài cũng khá lâu. Mình chưa bao giờ tiếp xúc với người Việt gốc nào giả bộ nói lớ tiếng Việt để “làm màu”. Những comments mình đọc được thì cũng nhiều thành phần nói thẳng ra là vô cùng vô văn hoá và thiếu suy nghĩ. Bao nhiêu người, già hay trẻ, xô vào để cấu xé cô gái có 22-24 tuổi làm vài video giải trí trên mạng. Rồi nhiều Tiktoker còn tự chế thông tin kêu là bạn này mới qua được một năm, bạn này bắt chước hoa hậu nào đó cũng bị lớ giọng sau khi học nhiều thứ tiếng. Thật sự là mình hơi ngạc nhiên khi thấy tình trạng bóc phốt bây giờ nhỏ nhặt đến mức chỉ nói lớ tiếng Việt là ăn chửi. Liệu Tiktok VN bây giờ có thô thiển quá mà chỉ toàn “The Drama”, kiếm nạn nhân để mà chửi câu view hay không?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a white guy travelling slowly by train and stopped in a small station called Bong Son 80km north of Quy Nhon then went 15km north with a taxi. There's obviously very little tourism there especially westerners so at least 1/3 of people say hello or ask questions, kids come running to me etc but mostly positive encounters.
 Of course some laugh at me because I'm a 185cm dude on some tiny multicolor bicycle I got from my hotel roaming the dirt roads but I don't mind.
 But today I was cycling at this spot https://maps.app.goo.gl/WJqaow9SXyUgEGic9 and a young guy around 16yo on a scooter stopped me in the middle of the road and was quite angry for some reason. Couldn't speak a word of english and I can't speak vietnamese. He left after maybe 2 minutes so I kept going the same way (down south to get to a creek) and he turned back, turned again and was behind me and gave me a kick with his foot in the back of my bicycle.
 I realised he certainly didn't want me to go that way for some reason so I turned back and I didn't see him again.
 Any idea what happened there ? It's not like there were house nearby or I was in a private property.

It's so incredibly different, for context, I'm Vietnamese Australian and being here made me fall in love with the life here, although maybe that's idealistic but living in a western society for so long made me realise how deeply problematic the social system and dynamic are, it might work for some and it might not work for others but I love it here, btw this is my first solo trip and well... So far here's my experience, the ho Chi Minh song from vietjetair is stuck in my head, I feel a deep sense of pride for him even though I wasn't born here,I oddly comfortable here, I ate Banh mi Huynh hoa, I spoke to the locals, I got scammed but hey it's all experienced so I'm not mad, just a little disappointed but hey it's life. People are helpful, willing to help.
 So I guess this probably a very adventurous start, and a big welcome to Vietnam. Wow, that's day 1 anyway till I post again, next flight Hanoi !
 If there is anything fun to do and awesome food/drink to try, please let me know !

 My concerns are:
  
air quality
 are there bike paths along those rivers where I can exercise
 can I rent a decent size apartment (over 40 sq. meters) within walking distance for under 1000 USD (prefer a bit lower).
  
I have never been to Vietnam but have only heard good things about living and working there.

Arriving in Hue on 21st and leaving Da Nang for Ho Chi Minh on 29th but because the current flooding in Hue we were wondering whether to completely skip central Vietnam and just go to the south. Do you think it's ok to go there still or should we miss it?
 My main concern is the flooding but also will it be mainly raining whilst we're there too? 
 Are Hoi an and da Nang impacted by the floods? And is transport still possible?
 In which case thinking of spending more time in the south.
 Recommendations from people locally are really appreciated or have been before!

We enjoy nature and calm but also maybe a place with a couple bars where we can meet people and also some nice cultural events. We were thinking somewhere north and we are not sure if we are going to stay very long in the south because of the hot weather. ( We like the cold!) Eventhough our flight back home will be leaving from Ho Chi Minh City. We are in Hanoï right now and we are craving for a place much less busy and quieter (we have been in cities for the past 3 weeks). It can also be in center Vietnam, we were thinking of being there at the end of December / beginning of January. Thank you for you advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I am a 27M from Western Europe but living in Korea since 2 years.
 I was recently contacted by a Korean giant company to work in Vietnam on a more leadership role than what I do now.
 Everything seems great for now however when going across the recruiter's profile I could see that they offered 30M/month on this job.
 As I don't know anything about Vietnam or their currencies, I checked the change and I was surprised to see that it was not even meeting the mininmum wage in my home country.
 I understand that economy and buying power may be different in Vietnam, however I am bound to travel a lot (Home country, Korea, SEA...).
 Because it seems so low, I was wondering if it was a scam or a possible mistake, or if it is a normal and decent salary in Vietnam.
 Edit : The job would be in Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu
 Edit 2 : I got a lot of answers, thank you for your reactivity !
 As far as I know, this is not a scam - I got contacted on LinkedIn and everything is linked to this worldwide korean company, including the job listing.
 As a LinkedIn expert myself having done a lot of recruitment, you can't usurpate identity and pretend to be from another company while posting a job.
 I didn't receive details about the salary yet. I just found the 30M information on the recruiter's profile.
 Thanks to you, from my understanding it may be great for a local but not for an expat. Let's hope their package is evolving if they want to hire an expat, or let's pray that they forgot a number !
 Thank you

 Just finished a 7 days motorcycle tour in Ha Giang that started and ended in Hanoi.
 I've never seen a more scary place than Hanoi and surrounding area from a pollution, crowded and garbage perspective.
 The 70 km from Thai Nguyen to Hanoi I felt like I'm riding through the end of the world. 
 You cannot see the sky and buildings afar from pollution, over industrialization that pollutes every living thing, garbage everywhere.
 In the city sitting in traffic between a mass of cars, trucks emitting black smoke and scooters I felt like I'm going to pass out.
 Absolute hellish experience. Probably my first and last time in that city.

 I am an amateur photographer (website here for reference) and am very interested in photographing the fishing villages around Da Nang and Hoi An--more particularly Hoi An where I anticipate heading to after landing in Da Nang. I would like to photograph fisherman with their nets out on the water but also people mending/storing nets in the villages. Stylistically, this would be very similar to Réhan's work with fishing villages.
 I am looking for recommendations on where near Hoi An (or Da Nang) people fish. I understand there is some fishing right of Cua Dai beach. Would hiring a boat on the Thu Bon river allow for easier viewing of fisherman?
 Thanks!

 i really did not understand what the vietnam war actually was about til i got older cause through their lense it was mainly „well the communist were shit and evil towards us“ but they did not mention too much the american army. so i grew up thinking „well these communist folks were super bad“ (and „communist“ was used interchangebly with „north vietnamese“). also, grew up pretty western, so the evil communist narrative is kinda norm.
 at some point, a couple of years ago i watched this long documentary series called „vietnam“ by us-american documentary filmmaker ken burns, and for me, it was a very significant turning point cause now all the „evil communist“ had faces, their story, their motive. that being said, of course i knew the narrative of my parents are by no means universal. but you know, that was basically the only story all your life.
 however, i never knew that this war was so incredibly complex, not only since the beginning of the american engagement. for me the documentary doesn‘t seem to biased, on the contrary, it reveals alot of the american misjudgment and bad (and dare to say, evil) decisions. 
 how do you guys perceive the documentary? do people in vietnam know this movie? what effect did it have on you, if you‘ve seen it? genuinely interested in some thoughts

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context I’m Hoa— but I speak Viet and Mandarin (from university) mostly. But I recently had to finish a paper and thinking writing about Viet would be probably easy. I ran across the work of Mark Alves, a linguist who basically reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of Vietic language. And I started to realise how Vietnamese really kinda stands on its own as being a SouthEastern and East Asian language. I don’t why but this was my shower thought about why there is so much Chinese built within Vietnamese language.
 I noticed in his work there was a lot of old Chinese (and of course other dialects and Chinese words over history) still used in Vietnamese. I had a weird shower thought that Vietnamese language seems like a sponge for Chinese language, if they didn’t have an existing word for it they just take it from their big neighbours. And I think hearing from my family about colonialism isn’t the whole story why there’s so many words adopted. I’m curious about if anyone knows if there are studies on this.

 I am a so called "Việt kiều" in my early 20s. Born and raised in America. I have been back to Vietnam 4 times since I was 12, with the most recent trip being about a month ago. It was the first time coming back as a grown adult, so I did and saw a lot more. It was the most memorable trip of my life.
 Returning to America, I feel my life is boring. I don't have many friends, and I hate my job. It felt weird to have to return and live in a country that is so quiet and...sterile in comparison. We have a Viet community here in my state, but it pales in comparison to Texas, Cali. I miss Vietnam so much, I am considering getting a 90 day visa and returning before Tết, living off of savings. I have family who are more than happy to accommodate me, but I also want to rent a place for a mon…]]></summary>

 During my last trip to south east Asia I visited Vietnam and, of course, I fell in love with the Country.
 I also really enjoyed Hoi An and its charm, and I had the opportunity to get some tailored suits (of course) and to buy some leather items such as wallets, keychain, etc.
 I bought the leather stuff in a store called Da Bao, which I tried to send some email to see if they can do international shipments. But unfortunately I had no replies. 
 So my question to you guys is, can you recommend a good store who can do it? (of course non strictly from hoi an).
 Cảm ơn!

 Out of several 500,000 VND bills, one of them is slightly torn. I took a picture of the ATM and the ATM number and information on it.
 Have been here before in the past they made a big deal about a slightly torn and 200,000 VND note, and would not take it.
 According to this law site, it states any bank per the law needs to replace a ripped bill, however, and practice does this work? Or should I just tape it and try to use it somewhere? The tear is maybe 4-5mm on the bottom of the note.

For money that is not eligible for circulation as stipulated in Clause 2 Article 4 of this Regulation, the above units shall receive and consider exchanging with the conditions specified in Point a, b Clause 2 Article 6 of this Circular. If the conditions for money exchange are not satisfied, these units shall return the money to customers and give a notice of the reason thereof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I caught the night train down from Hanoi last night. We hit massive flooding just outside Hue (Quang Tri) and stopped at 7am. 
 We haven’t moved since. We can’t get off the train, and we’re not being given any information by the staff, or the tourism company the train service is with. There’s not much food or water, and the staff are hiding from us. 
 I’m starting to get quite worried and stressed. Does anyone know when the floods will recede? Or could we be stuck here on the train until the weekend or longer? We’re scared we will run out of food and water and power soon. We definitely won’t move until morning now. 
 We would get off and try to find a car to take us back north, but it’s dark and too risky, we don’t know the situation out there. 
 Please stay safe everyone in the region!
 Edit: woke up. We’ve still not moved. We’ve been on the train for 36 hours+ now. It’s still raining heavily. My boyfriend is starting to get sick and is coughing with no water. We’re starting to get very sad and scared. We haven’t seen any staff members for 10+ hours. We’re not at a station so can’t get off. We’re on a ‘tourist carriage’ so no Vietnamese to ask for help. We’re ‘safe’ physically from the rain, and I’m grateful for that, but I’m so fed up of not knowing. At this point, we just want to fly back home from what was meant to be our dream trip. I feel so, so guilty for suggesting we take the train 😭 
 Edit 2: staff has abandoned us. We cannot find them. We have had news and no supplies for 12+ hours. Everyone is leaving the train and trying to escape now. We know it’s not safe, but we will also risk leaving now while it’s still light and the rain has stopped for a while. We will try to get to Dong Ha, then go north.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Vietnamese friend of mine is in big financial difficulties. Stupidly he took loans from illegal lenders - sharks @ 15% interest per month. He paid interest every month but none of the principal amount, so far 90% of the loan value. 
 Considering this kind of lending is illegal, how can he get out of this and negotiate better terms without ending up injured or worse?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title suggest, it is currently flooded and my flight out is tomorrow morning at 10. Should I pack some food now and head on out to the airport now?
 I don't think the waters are going to clear out overnight so I'm better off going now vs struggling tomorrow?
 What do you guys think is the best course of action?
 I probably have to find higher ground then flag down a cab or book a grab to the airport? I'm guessing I can wash up there and wait overnight for my flight.
 I have a friend flying out tonight, she's heading to Saigon. I will just checkout today despite paying till tomorrow. Is there food available at HUI Airport?
 Edit: was trapped in the hotel, the staff had locked up the doors and abandoned us. Absolute bizarre experience but turns out it was tied up.
 Untied and made it to the streets before a boat picked up us. Currently staying at a homestay just a km away from the airport.
 What an experience.

 Ive arrived yesterday in Vietnam (Hanoi) yesterday for the first time. Unfortunately, I learmed when I arrived at the airport that my checked bag has not made it through with me. I was lucky enough to have pack my most expensive item with me (just in case you know...) But now I'm left without clothes and over the counter medications (tynenol, gravol, Imodium, ...).
 I have been trying to find places to buy back some stuff in Hanoi today that are legit and provide receipt. While I was able to get some medications I'm Pharmacity in Hanoi. I've not been able to find legit places to get basic clothes with receipt. I went to a mall that have Amerian brands to try to find something that is not a random store in the street but realized that there is only men's clothes and everything is well overpriced aven comparer with Canada. 
 Do you know a good place to go to shop for essentials, most importantly shoes but also shorts, pants, shirts where they give receipt and prices are ok? My itinerary '/reservation are to go to Cat Ba and Nin Ninh in the next day but I doubt I'll find something there. I'm very lost at this point so I'm ok going back to Hanoi of required.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 
 I've stayed here for a bunch of years now and I always had a gaming PC with me. Every house/apartment I've lived in, my PC case or peripherals like microphone or any metallic parts will discharge a painful static shock to the part that touches my person. 
 I've checked online to make sure I did everything within my control, things like no carpet under the CPU, new power cables, quality extension plugs and no stray exposed cables touching the case. 
 Wall plugs here doesn't have the 3 hole option so that's telling me something is not grounded hence the shocks. 
 If it helps, my microphone gives out a permanent static white noise with or without my voice activating the microphone, tested by using the "listen to this device function. 
 Questions: 
  
Should I change my PSU? 
 
Should I call the electrician to come and ground my house properly (I recently built a new house)? 
 
Are there any work arounds for those who experienced the same problem? 
 
Gamers with gaming laptops, do you get shocks from your laptops while its charging? (I am seriously considering getting a laptop because of this problem but I am unsure if it makes any difference because of the lack of grounding) 
 
 Any help is greatly appreciated!

 My brother, nephew and I are going to HCM in January. We are staying near the Bui Vien street and this is no hate towards tourists like we are, but it's also nice to experience the 'real nightlife' like the locals experience it. 
 All three of us are happily in a relationship right now, so it's not about 'hunting' girls. It's all about having a good time in a bar or club. Something different than Bui Vien (or something located on Bui Vien but not really tourist-heavy). Do you guys have some tips and tricks for us three?

 It seems like I may be going to Vietnam sometime in December 2023/January 2024. I am still waiting for e-visa to be approved. What will the weather be like there at around this time? Is there any trains going in/out of the different cities? I ask because I tried googling it and it gave me nothing. 
 This is my first time in Vietnam. We will be flying in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), I have no itinerary right now, but what do you recommend visiting from Saigon, mostly day trips or a night or two stay overs? And share any other information you want. 
 I am super excited to be visiting, if I do end up going. Many thanks in advance.

 On the shoulder of a road, there was a truck. On the loading area, numerous crates were filled with dogs. In each crate, there were so many dogs that they were stacked on top of each other. Some of the dogs were trembling, utterly frightened, or not moving at all. I suspect some of them were already dead.
 I presume these are stray dogs that have been captured. But what is done with them? Are they taken somewhere and killed? Is that even legal? If they are killed, why are they subjected to such cruelty first? Not to mention, I don't find killing them acceptable.

 Bit of a weird/obscure one but a while back I saw a video about a banh mi place in Saigon (possibly elsewhere but 99% sure). Their main speciality was a huge banh mi with beef short rib as the meat, they put it on the roll with the bone still in and then pull the bone out.
 I'm flying into Vietnam for the 7th time later this week and was hoping to try this place but have lost any record of it and can't find it anywhere. Hoping someone here may be familiar with it and can help.
 If it helps, they also offered a few more different/fancy banh mis including a seafood one with caviar. It wasn't one of the $100 banh mis or anything, was about 3-400K or so and big enough to feed 2 people.

This concept of jumping on a bike behind a stranger and letting them drive you on a freaking bike scares the shit out of me 😅 How does it even work - do you hold/hug them from behind or how do you hold? Isn't the helmet they give you super gross from all previous passengers who leave their sweat there? Is it even safe to use?
 Those are genuine questions, not a rant 🙂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to rant here because this happened on a VietJet flight, but I’ve noticed other Asian airlines have the same stupid rules.
 The 7kg cabin baggage limit doesn’t make any sense! It’s supposed to be the combined limit for the carry-on and the personal item, but both are usually over this limit. Any carry-on under 7kg would be mostly empty. 
 I don’t care if an airline wants to make more money and charge more. They can certainly do so, but they should have reasonable rules and clear prices.
 I just had a bad experience checking in to a VietJet flight where the employe made me empty my carry-on and put half of the things in my big bag and half in my backpack. They checked in my big bag which was now slightly over the 20kg limit and my almost empty carry-on. They kept telling me to make my backpack lighter, but it was that heavy because of my laptop, iPad and battery pack which can’t be checked in because they contain lithium batteries. I kept asking them what to do, but even they didn’t know the solution and eventually just let me go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[👋 hello. American looking for authentic cha gio here in the states. Specifically, many Vietnamese restaurants use egg-based (yellow) roll wrap paper and not the clear, white rice paper. I was always told that the yellow one was the Chinese way of making them, and that proper cha gio were made with the clear ones. (Is this true?) Personally, I prefer the clear white wraps 100% of the time. I’m disappointed when I order cha gio in a restaurant and I get the yellow kind. Does anyone know how I can ask what kind of paper they use and what answer reflects my preferences? Will a Vietnamese restaurant look at me sideways for even asking?
 Thanks!
 Background: American, but my (White) grandmother was born and raised in Vietnam. Our family has since adopted some Vietnamese dishes as part of our family culinary traditions, including thit koh, bun thit, and cha gio. Looking to maintain those family traditions in the way I was taught. 😊

We still work out and like to party and eat out and stuff, so the other day we went to our favorite neighborhood spot for some grub. There were about 30 of us, and although we can’t see a thing, we have excellent hearing and some of us speak English.
 So we were seated around various tables and we heard this foreign guy seeming to have a great time with his female friends. There were all just chatting and we figured out that he was gay and they were out having a “ladies day” of sorts. He was joking around with them and gossiping like one of the girls. He kept saying stuff like “no betch” and “that’s right girl, he ain’t all that”.
 Then we heard the sound of another foreigner and he also sounded effeminate. He seemed to be trying to flirt with the first guy. The first guy suddenly pretended to be all macho and changed his voice. We were like bruh.
 We heard what sounded like hands grabbing plump body parts and we heard some kissing. Then the other gay guy got even madder and was saying stuff like “you know you don’t like them, you big faker” and then we heard footsteps storming off.
 So we all just chuckled and went on with our meal. You hear a lot of wacky stuff around here if you just stop to listen

 Out of the corner of my eye, observed what appeared to be an ethnically Malaysian tourist, a “brownie” smiling cheek-to-cheek, sitting with these very attractive and somewhat scantily, but not unusually dressed Vietnamese females, but thought nothing of it as one of them was my cousin, Trang, and the other two, knew from the High School karaoke club and the local Kung Fu dojo, as one of the other girls was a well accomplished martial arts champion.

We took him for something to eat before we go back to his hotel since we were quite a bit hungry. Although a bit drunk, he agreed. While eating, he was a bit handsy so we wanted to finish the meal quickly so we could get back to the hotel and do the deeds. 
 Out of nowhere, this tourist confronted our John, and said that he should stop. He made a big scene and everyone was looking at us. We thought the tourist was going to get into a fight with our John, so instead of it escalating, me and my girls just paid for the food and got out of there ASAP. 
 ​
 Guys, how do I avoid situation like this? Do I get handsy myself on the John so that tourist don't think that I'm being kidnapped?

I was minding my own business and having fun with three other Viet women. They were like 45 kilograms of chicken these women. The women were enjoying themselves with the drinks I was buying. I was balling out with these 45 kilogram chicken and they were loving it. Then all the sudden this crazy tourist comes over trying to be a hero and tell me to take my hands off the product. I ignored him as I paid for these women, so I kissed them. He said something again about me touching the woman. So I grabbed the women again to piss him off and kissed them as well. The guy looked miserable. Like he had come to vacation with his wife and mother in law. He was jealous as I left my wife and mother in law at home. Why would you bring that kind of sand to the beach? There is plenty of sand here to play with. Any how, the women were having fun and enjoying my company. These tourist should mind their business just like I was. We are some hard working men from Malaysia here for some R&R. These type of tourist confuse me. Are they here to vacation and have fun or play some fantasy superhero? If the women were in trouble they could scream or call the police. There was plenty of people around and we were all having fun. 🤩 Enjoy life my people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a fun story I wanted to share, no offense to anyone who digs the style I‘m going to talk about.
 My dad migrated from Vietnam 30 years ago and what striked me almost my whole adolescent life was his particular style of clothing. Like everything has a luxury brand name on it. All in all it it’s this kind of „young money“ street style from 2010. Sunglasses, caps, LV satchel, expensive watch, you name it, paired with buddhist accessories. From a fashion standpoint it’s completely randomly combined. This stands out even more since no other 60 year old man dresses this way in the country I grew up in. Though I’d say especially migrant groups tend to do that as well as a status symbol though there‘s something, besides the jade bracelets and stuff, that makes it so different and I really can‘t say what.
 And then, in 2019, I visited Vietnam for my first time. And when I walked around Bui Vien street or took the local busses, I’ve seen other middle aged men that radiated some thuggish ominous vibe like bouncers and I realized They wear the same outfits!! I don‘t know what exactly made it so similar but the composition of their outfits reminded me immediately of my dad. I had the feeling they wore even more accessories like a watch but also a jade bracelet and a wooden pearl bracelet on the same arm. It‘s so weird hahaha but now I know, where he got that inspiration from

She is from vietnam and started a successful nail salon in the United States with her family. I was chatting with her and I said the acetone solution looks like Kool aid and she said she doesn't know what Kool aid is and has never had it. As gross as it may sound to some Kool aid was a big part of my life growing up and while I don't drink it in adulthood since its not the best for you I still love it. Would it be rude for me to bring her some? Unopened obviously. I feel like it may come across as rude or making fun of her and that is NOT my intention. I'm posting this here because I'm unaware of the nuances in Vietnamese culture surrounding gift giving and such. The last thing I want to do is offend her.

 Thank you very much in advance :)

I’ll be staying at an airbnb and have been asked for my passport pic by the owner to show to the police? is crime very rampant there?
 Also what are some must go and no go in Hanoi? I’ll be taking a daytrip to Halong bay too so I guess it’s more of a 3d2n trip in Hanoi.

I also understand that the death penalty is carried out by firing squad. Can anyone enlighten me on this please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I rented an apartment from VXH, a government high ranking manager, possibly some general. The apartment is in Mipec complex, Hà Đông, Hà Nội. When I vacated the place, he visited the place and confirmed that he will return the deposit. He carried on my duty to pay the bills and lèa the house. Later on, he also replied a message to return the money on Oct 12. However, it has been a month since, and he has not returned the deposit. He refused my phone calls and never reply his reason not to return the money. Since sueing or asking for money is potentially problematic, I want to ask. 1. is it ok to ask his friends/wife/people at his place for his whereabouts? 2. how to sue now that I left Hà Nội and can't return. Would the government office, whatever that handles the case request me to be in Hanoi to carry on with the case? I also have heard that his wife works in the court and this will most likely thrown out. So how to make sure that the case will go. 3) there are many laws, on of which is the notorious 331 that puts people in prison for supposedly defamation of character. Their law in defamation of character is not like in the States - I have no profit or ill intention to do this beside getting my money. So how to avoid this?

 Hey, I'll spend 3 weeks in vietnam with my gf in march/april and we're staying in Nha Trang for 6 days. She really liked this hotel but something feels off. Some comments on booking are a bit weird and I can't find much on google, but it's on booking so... Anyone knows anything about it? 
 Otherwise, any recommendations for a good resort/hotel in Nha Trang, Tuy Hoa or around that area? Nha Trang is where I'm ok spending money on accomodation since it's the only place where we'll actually spend time at the hotel/resort, so I'm looking for one of those 5 stars with amazing buffets, pools and all that. 
 Any other recomendations regarding Nha Trang and its surroundings are welcome :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around 9:30 PM tonight, November 11, 2023, I was passing through the Kim Liên tunnel, Hanoi, Vietnam. I was on the back of a fast-moving motorbike when I randomly looked up at the sky and saw many flashing, color-changing circles like these. These are original videos and ones that have been made to slow motion so you can see everything in different speed. At first, I thought they were lights from a crane on a high-rise building, so I looked away. But a few seconds later, I looked up again and wondered “what? hold on…” how there could be such a high building in the sky! I tried to take a photo but couldn't because the bike was moving too fast, so I recorded videos instead. It looked very surreal and strange in person. I've never seen anything like this before. Did anyone else passing by that area tonight look up and see the same thing? Could these be drones? Can anyone explain what this might be?

Khi tôi dọn đi đã bàn giao nhà đàng hoàng, và trả toàn bộ tiền điện nước dịch vụ, có xác nhận. Chủ nhà cũng hứa sẽ trả tiền cọc 8tr ngày 12/10. Căn nhà thuê ở chung cư Mipec, Quận Hà Đông. 
 Nhưng đến giờ thì ông ta vẫn chưa trả và không trả lời tôi. 
 Tôi không biết một cán bộ quân đội, sợ cái gì, mà không thể trả lời. 
 Không muốn trả hay bất cứ lý do gì thì ông ta cũng trả lời tôi một tiếng được. Chẳng lẽ một người lính lại không có dũng khí để nói ra được điều mình muốn. 
 Tôi chỉ muốn ông ta trả tiền, hay chí ích là trả lời. 
 Mà đòi thế nào cho hợp lý với ông cán bộ cấp cao này.
 1) đòi tiền thế nào trong khi ông ta không hợp tác? Nếu tôi nhắn tin đến gia đình người thân ông ta, chỉ để hỏi ông ta ở đâu, tôi cần kiếm để hỏi vụ cọc thì có được không?
 2) nếu kiện cáo thì khi triệu tập tôi có nhất thiết phải gặp không? Tôi không có ở HN, và ông ta thì ở HN.
 3) làm sao để tránh cái tội nhục mạ, khi bản chất việc lấy tiền của người khác là nhục, mà đòi tiền thì nhắc đến cái nhục đó?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When a foreign traveler first sets foot in unique Vietnam, they are immediately shocked by the bustling and intricate traffic scenes. Especially in major cities like Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, the streets of Vietnam are a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds, where thousands of vehicles move incessantly. Foreigners may be surprised to witness the sight of motorcycles – the dominant mode of transportation in Vietnam – gliding smoothly through narrow streets, sometimes carrying an entire family or towering loads of goods. Alongside these, leisurely bicycles, creatively crafted homemade vehicles, traditional ‘Xích lô’, and even large trucks jostle together, creating a multi-hued tapestry of urban life.

 My aunties would all be waiting until 5am so they can drive them home LOL 
 Near the end of the night, my uncle's would fight eachother too and someone would go home with a black eye, the next week they come back, it's all good hahah wth.

 We are Raven and the Dark Shadows, a rock band out of Miami Beach, Florida. Our album features musicians from Pearl Jam and New Found Glory.
 We are currently planning a Pacific tour and thinking of stopping in Vietnam on our route.
 Do you guys know of any cool venues. Something like an old theater or converted church is ideal for us. A capacity between 150 and 300 is ideal. Looking forward to visiting your beautiful country, and if you have any insider tips, please let us know!
 Thank you.

 Visiting Hanoi for 2-3 weeks, and my partner and I are interested to meet some other artists. We're in video game design, music, and videography. Any recommendations for where we could find live music or any sort of a scene related to the above? Limitation is that we don't speak Vietnamese, so I understand if that might be quite hard at a deeper level.
 Similarly, what part of town would fit us best? We've both travelled a lot, and don't need the coddling of having a boulangerie and pizza parlor within arms reach at all times.

I’m more interested in nature scenes and not a big city person, so a day in Hanoi is probably enough for me. The tour would have us stay the first night in Ninh Binh and then drive us to Ha Long the next day and stay overnight on a cruise. I read here that booking might be cheaper in the quarter but I’m not sure where to find them or which tour we should go with? I saw one online for $250 each which isn’t cheap. Would they also charge extra for water and other necessities? And would it feel too rushed to do this tour?

 We are always accused of racism, but when I talk to my parents, grandparents or other older people and ask them about Vietnamese people in the GDR, I only hear great acknowledgement and appreciation. Statements like "good and honest people", "they were very decent and hard-working", "calm and level-headed", or "we didn't see them as foreigners". I have never heard anyone say anything bad about Vietnamese people. I wish I could say the same about Muslims from the MENA countries, today. I just wanted to let you know that in the past, as well as today, you are very much appreciated in Germany.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left Vietnam with my mom when I was a baby. My dad died drowning in the sea trying to escape a year before us. 
 I've been in Vietnam for two weeks now and I was actually quite surprised by how much poverty there still is here. It seems that so many people are struggling and making so little money. The diet, stress, sunlight exposure seem to all contribute to the population having smaller bodies/frames and looking much older than their counter parts in the west. I'm 5'11" with a muscular build and I feel like freaking captain America walking around here. 
 All this makes me very grateful for my life. But I also feel guilty because I realize everything I have was given to me. I didn't choose to the west. I am just a product of my parents and environment. It was my mere chance that I am where I am and who I am. One little change in my past, like my mom deciding not to try to escape or getting caught escaping and I could be in saigon trying to hustle like everyone else here. 
 I am also saddened to see how much Vietnamese ppl struggle and work so hard in this ungodly humid and hot temperature. It seems like they have so few opportunities to advance and make a better life. 
 I have heard things are slowly changing though. More people are able to get higher education and the middle class is growing. I hope when I come back in ten years things will be much more different. 
 As viet kieus, do you guys feel the same gratitude and guilt as I do?

 As a viet kieu I have no problem going to a hole in the wall to order and eat. But when I go there I notice people there staring at me. And sometimes the workers have a bit of an attitude? I might just be paranoid or over thinking it. I speak Vietnamese (semi fluent) so I don't think they're annoyed that I can't order properly. 
 What do you guys think? Am I just being paranoid or is there really a locals only vibe at some places?

Almost every day we have been here, the locals try scamming us. From the street sellers who give me less change money than I'm supposed to get, the "take a photo with my fruit basket on a stick" and then heckling you to give photo money or buy something, "take a free donut", etc. It's wearing me down as I'm a very honest person and have tried my entire adult life to support little mom and pop shops with their businesses. We just spent 2 months in korea and a week in Japan and those locals were very honest, did not heckle, and if they offered a free sample, it was really free. Plus the lack of consideration. Last night at 1:30am, there is construction still going on like a circular saw and banging metal. I wake up to it, and have to sleep with it. Does the police or other locals not care about quiet sleeping time? We have never encountered something like this on a constant basis in any other country we've traveled to.
 We are scheduled to leave here next week, then off to Ho Chi Mihn for a week, and then after that we had scheduled Da Nang for a whole month but now considering canceling Da Nang if it's going to be more of the same. So for people who have traveled to Da Nang, can you tell me if we will be facing the same situation as here in Old Quarter Hanoi?
 ​
 We have met some really nice people in nice shops who offer us good service and the right change so we have been returning to those spots to eat. There's a coconut/smoothie spot we enjoy so everyday we buy 5 drinks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! My family and I will be travelling to Vietnam in January 2024 for a month. I was wondering what the weather is like there? We will be spending a week in HCMC, a week in Hue and some days in maybe Da Nang, Nha Trang or Da Lat. I’m getting some mixed information that it’ll be hot, maybe chilly or foggy. 
 We are from Canada so I would really like to know what I should be mindful of and pack for. TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I just wanted to give an update on this poll I did a while back: https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/16jlwu5/market_research_for_handbagtote_bag_fashion_start/
 ​
 I'm slowly launching the tote bags that I described in the original post. I feel a little bit embarrassed to try to push this new project out there but what do I have to lose then to share my experience right?
 I am so thankful for the people who voted in the poll and gave their opinions. It really helped me narrow down my focus. This is a passion project that stemmed from a long overdue trip to Vietnam.
 I was born in a refugee camp in Malaysia and moved to Canada when I was 4. I only been to Vietnam once when I was 14 on a family trip. Then this year back in April I decided to go back to Vietnam on my own at the age of 30. It was an incredible experience reconnecting with family and making new friends as a solo traveler who can barely speak Vietnamese. I have to say that Vietnamese locals are so open and love to connect with foreigners - I think that's what makes the country so great!
 Anyways, I got a felt tote bag from a popular Men's wear brand there and walked around with it in Canada, constantly getting compliments on the bag. I decided to start my own brand selling these felt tote bags with my own designs. Right now the designs and branding is focused on the soft "Asian" girl aesthetic but I hope to venture beyond these tote bags to explore different aspects of being Vietnamese living outside of Vietnam. I feel that we are constantly trying to connect to heritage while building a unique Western-Vietnamese experience navigating two cultures.
 I hope you guys follow The New Win on social media and check out the website: bythenewwin.com.
 As you can see the poll winner "Saigon District 1" inspired the first design. I'm gearing up for the first Drop soon and I hope you check back for more Drops in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[as the title says.
 today i had a call with my mom, and apparently in my hometown parents are really worried about their kids watching weird, loud videos where soldiers brutally killing humanoid heads in giant toilets. and i immediately knew it's the pointless "skibidi toilet" trend.
 this used to be a harmless thing where gamers made silly videos using a game called Garry's Mod just to have fun with each others.
 but Vietnamese trashy creators, as they always do, now catch up with the thing and try to create the most controversy and harmful things ever, while pasting "skibidi toilet" into the title to trick kids into giving them more views. horrible thumbnails with real Vietnamese faces popping out of a toilet, and you call that children's watchable contents?
 it's sad to see how abusive Vietnamese trash content creators have become. in the past, they literally made videos like Spiderman having weird thoughts with freaking Elsa from Frozen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my friends booked a flight to Thailand by searching through Skyscanner, booking was done through the third party Agoda platform. After a few days, we received an email that stated that our flight is changed from 12pm departure to 9pm departure from Singapore. We have activities already planned out and I feel it is unfair for them to change the timing without giving us the option to refund.
 We have tried calling them via the contact found on their website and Google maps (Call center 19001886 or send email to [19001886@vietjetair.com](mailto:19001886@vietjetair.com)) but nobody picked up, all their social media links to nowhere and we even tried visiting the office in Singapore, which is non existent ("Vietjet Air Singapore Ticketing Office" on Google Maps). 
 Has anyone encountered this situation before? Any advice on what we can do? (Ideally a refund)

 Feel free to tell me what you think. I'm wondering if the progression is not too quick - maybe I should add more levels with only two tones to choose from.

 https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3240554/vietnamese-decry-construction-borders-unesco-site-ha-long-bay-killing-everything
 A huge residential complex being built on the borders of Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay prompted a public outcry in the Southeast Asian country on Monday, as concerns mount over human impacts that have degraded the Unesco World Heritage site.
 The bay, famed for its brilliant turquoise waters dotted with towering rainforest-topped limestone islands, is one of Vietnam’s most popular tourist destinations, attracting more than seven million visitors last year.
 The shore and the surrounding town are already heavily developed. But on Sunday pictures were published in state media of an enormous construction site running through the waters – and next to the spectacular karsts – of Bai Tu Long Bay, which borders Ha Long.

 As I know, the official salary of officials is very low, even lower than workers. Even the prime minister's salary is only around 20,000,000 VND.
 This creates the first problem: because they are the only ones who can solve problems (administrative, legal) for the people. They will create barriers to make the problem more difficult to solve. To get bribe money.
 The higher their position, the more difficult problems they can solve, and the more bribes they can get. Because these positions can all be bought with money. This environment, of course, becomes a potential market for investment.

 Background: I'm Vietnamese- born and raised in vietnam but moved to United States at very young age. I'm still able to retain the language. My girlfriend is Egyptian born and raised in Egypt, and also moved to United States at a very young age. You rarely see Vietnamese/Egyptian couples in the states...which makes our relationship very unique. Both of our culture values are very similar. Most would think that Arab are muslim...which is true but my gf and I are both christian but different domination...anyways that's a whole different conversation of it own. My parents are very traditional. they would want me to date and marry to a Vietnamese girl. However to me, i should be able date anyone regardless of culture/race. Every time i would talk about girls outside of the culture they will give racist remarks.
 Question: How would i go about introducing my Girlfriend to my traditional Vietnamese parents without them having a prejudice mindset?

 During the discussion, Adani expressed his admiration for Pham Nhat Vuong's entrepreneurial journey. He was particularly impressed by how Vuong transitioned from the instant noodle business to becoming a leading force in the production of cutting-edge electric vehicles and advanced battery solutions for global sustainable mobility. All of this was achieved in a remarkably short span of time.

 I'm in Hanoi for three weeks and occasionally need to do some work. I just need a normal desk with an office chair and a monitor. I contacted some co-working spaces, which would be perfect because they charge by the day, but they don't offer any hardware (monitor, keyboard and a mouse).
 Another option would be to go to a gaming cafe and just plug their hardware into my laptop. Has anyone done that?
 Would renting the equipment be an option? Tried googling, but only a single really expensive option came up. Buying doesn't work as I will be traveling around Vietnam. 
 There should be quite a lot of digital nomads in Vietnam, so someone has to have dealt with the same problem. Didn't find any on this subreddit tho.
 Thanks!
 PS! I'll probably face the same problem in January at Da Nang, so any info on the way of the land over there would also be much appreciated.

But looking at how Bangladesh managed to get Russian help then I suppose it's the government's fault for having fallen into Western "renewable energy trap". We know that only nuclear energy can support economy better than renewables. So what are your opinions ?

 The Southeast Asian electronics manufacturing hub is home to Intel's largest factory worldwide for assembling, packaging and testing chips, and has been banking on the company further expanding there especially after Joe Biden announced deals to support Vietnam's chips industry during a visit in September.
 Vietnam is keen to position itself as an alternative to China and Taiwan, amid political risks and trade tensions with the United States.

I don’t know how to swim which I know is embarrassing and as it turns out one of the bucket list things to do is in ha long bay is kayaking. We’re doing the cruise which is fine but is kayaking something that’s recommended even for someone who can’t swim? Would I miss out on a lot if I don’t do it? My friends are okay with me just staying on the cruise and waiting but if it’s safe enough then I might give in. Any suggestions or opinions are welcome. Thank you!

 I think I’ve got a pretty solid itinerary planned, but since it’s the holiday season I’m hoping to pick up some unique souvenirs and gifts to bring back to the U.S. I found a shop in Ho Chi Minh City called OHQUAO that seems pretty great - unique paper goods/design. Wondering if there are other shops like this people would recommend I check out? I really enjoy shopping for home goods, art/decor, stuff like that.
 Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

We were walking along My Khe beach late afternoon in the rain, and suddenly noticed parts of the water got darker， with several cockroaches washed up on shore, some live ones were crawling around that area as well. I was shocked to see the sewage overflowing into the water. Is My Khe beach clean enough to swim? Or any suggestions for other beach areas north or south of my khe that may be more clean/safe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How is gestational diabetes handled in vietnam? Is it something these they for? What are the glucose levels recommended to follow? 
 I’m a vietnamese American living in America and currently pregnant with our first baby. Recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have to meet glucose levels set by American medical institutes. Given that I’m ethnically Asian and grew up eating Asian food at home and maintain Việt culture at home life- I am apt to believe a lot of the American medical standards don’t fit me as I’m not the same genetic or dietary background as most of their standards which is collective studies base on the “average” white person (since white ppl make up the majority of the population in america) so was curious what vietnam did for gestational diabetes 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 My parents have extremely high triglycerides and don't show any signs of slowing down their white carbohydrate intake. It is in the 1,000+ range. I tried to find the word in Vietnamese but i haven't found it, and I only found words for blood pressure and cholesterol.
 How can I explain it to my parents? My viet is crap and I wasn't able to find so many articles on it. I would also like to show them some articles/videos in Vietnamese that will support what my doctor and I agreed on, which is a lower carbohydrate diet and its benefits, and why she should not be eating so many carbohydrates (80% of diet)

 In 1075-1077, the Vietnamese Ly Dynasty launched an invasion deep into Song China's territory. They were still a small kingdom that only gained independence 100 years ago and were attacking the strongest empire on earth at the time. The Song responded by invading Vietnam but they were defeated.
 The Mongols also invaded Vietnam and were defeated in all 3 times.
 While the Ming Dynasty conquered Vietnam in 1407, they were only able to hold Vietnam for 20 years.
 In 1471, Vietnam managed to wipe out Champa, which was an enemy for over 500 years out of existence. This is akin to France wiping Spain or Germany out of existence.

 Two friends visited me once in Hanoi and they were super excited about the chance to get laid with some asian girls. They were talking about it the whole time before they even arrived. Even though i opposed that, I showed them places where they could get what they want, for no more than 1.5M.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stayed at two hotels now and both were not good. They looked nothing like the pictures and even though they had good reviews, it seems like the reviews were lies. 
 The rooms were terribly small. One had no window whatsoever. The "pool" was like 2 feet deep. The "gym" was two treadmills and a bike. The construction quality of the rooms and bathrooms were shoddy. Everything felt thin and cheap. You can hear everything happening through the walls. 
 On the plus side, the staff were always extremely kind and helpful. I really loved the service. The breakfast nuggets were always good as well. 
 Both hotels were half a million dong per night. 
 Do I just need to find more expensive hotels? What's a good budget for something decent but not extravagant? A million dongs?

I will add that I am Vietnamese myself, and I call all my cousins whose parents are older than mine "chị/anh" (vice versa for younger and "em"), but is this the standard? Was curious since it does sometimes lead to me calling my cousins who are much older than me "Em" and my middle schooler cousins "Anh", and I always found it a bit funny

 I need some advice, please. I will stay in Hanoi for one and a half days, and I want to do a one-day trip. However, I'm a bit hesitant about which option to choose:
 1) Halong Bay (Route 2)
 2) Ninh Binh (Hoa Lu, Trang An, Tam Coc, Hang Mua)
 3) Bai Dinh, Trang An, Mua Cave
 Thank you so much

 In phu quoc, I notice ppl look a bit younger and overall happier.

I find it incredibly off-putting and it usually just makes me want to leave immediately as I feel under pressure.
 Has anybody else noticed this phenomena? Is it normal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From my many years of travelling, visiting all of Southeast Asia except Laos and Myanmar, East Asia and India, it's my first time an airport staff aggressively shouted at me. 
 After the Immigration, the guy who checks your passport and boarding pass in the final security check, alerted me that there's an issue with my check-in baggage. He told me to wait in the waiting area. I was very nervous since it's the first time that my baggage was questioned. And I kept thinking of worst case scenario like finding illegal items and being fined etc. I was waiting for a few minutes and asked politely (saying "Sir") and he said that the staff from the airline is arriving. There's no one at the security screening at that point and after several minutes, asked him politely again, and then he shouted in a loud aggressive voice "I TOLD YOU TO WAIT HUH. WAIT!! " and I was shocked by that aproach. Even his fellow staff looked at him. 
 I was shaken by his aggressive reply and just sat in my seat while he just turned his back at me. Fortunately, the airline staff arrived and accompanied me at the baggage screening. It was a pocket wifi and it's carry on only. After clearing, I went to other side of security and went to boarding gates.
 (Also earlier, the lady at the check-in counter seems very testy, the way she processed the check-in procedures) 
 The staff at Saigon Airport seems to be in a lot of stress and not very friendly. I really had a bad experience on this Airport and it made a pretty bad impression as a visitor, , unlike the ones in Hanoi and Da Nang.. Honestly, from the attitude of staff and the whole airport experience (queueing, check-in), it's much worse than the comparable NAIA (Manila) T3. Next time, I will choose Da Nang or Hanoi Airport.

 was hoping that i could perhaps get a nice list of dinner places that are a bit more romantic.
 we don’t have any cuisine preferences, but maybe not chinese food? (because we have a LOT of that from where we’re from haha)
 i’m a student, so my budget is about $40-50 usd for us both. 
 thanks so much in advance! :)

 I’m reading about Vietnamese History and I’m wondering if Crown Prince Nguyễn Phúc Bảo Long had a son before he died in 2007. If not, does this mean the royal family in exile no longer has a successor anymore?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Looking for some input and if I should remove or add any days anywhere in particular and if I'm missing something. I'm a medium paced traveller, don't take things too slow but neither rush through the trip. 
 I'm into cozy hotels (not too expensive), historical sites & museums, local food, drinks & coffee places. I'm not a nightlife person and usually stay away from crazy spots - doesn't mean that I don't like to visit and see them for a couple hours. I want to make the best out of my Vietnam trip. 
 I'm planning the following route in my Vietnam trip for so many days:
 Hanoi 4
 Ha Long Bay 2 (Here I plan a one night trip where they come pick you up from hotel and return you the next day - any agency you'd recommend? looking at prices online I expect around 350 euro pp)
 Ninh Binh 2 (Saw that can be done as a day trip but many people recommend spending the night)
 Sapa 3 (Here is the most uncertain part of the trip, not sure if worth spending the 6 hours of train/bus to reach here, stay 1 full day, and return the 3rd day - any experiences on how to proceed best?) 
 Hanoi 1 (coming back from Sapa and prepare for flight to Da Nang)
 Da Nang/Hue/Hoi An 5 (any idea how many days I should spend in each? I'm reading that Hoi An would be the best out of these 3 cities so I don't mind cutting 1 city to spend more time in Hoi An) 
 HCMC 3 
 Phu quoc/ Con Dao 4 (I still have to decide which of the islands I should go to - price wise flight from HCMC is similar but I'm reading plenty of negative stuff on Phu Q so I'm leaning more towards Con Dao).

All these I can source quite easily in the UK. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Perhaps some traditional drinks or snacks? And if so, ideas of where I can buy them?

 Second question is about protein drinks. In Thailand there was a 7 Eleven every few steps, and they all sold various protein drinks. The Circle K I just went into had none. How can I procure protein drinks without buying a huge tub?
 Thanks everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend told me that in Vietnam there's a law where if you're in a car accident and at-fault, you have to pay the hospital bills of the person you injured. So apparently when someone gets hit, the driver will often turn around and try to "finish him/her off" since it's cheaper to pay for their funeral than all their medical expenses. 
 Is this true? Can someone link an article(s) where this actually took place. Sounds plausible yet comical.

 Một nguồn thông tin cho hay, Cơ quan CSĐT (Công an TP.HCM) vừa tống đạt các quyết định khởi tố vụ án, khởi tố bị can và thi hành lệnh bắt tạm giam đối với ông P.V.H. (47 tuổi, ngụ TP.Thủ Đức) về hành vi “Mua dâm người dưới 18 tuổi”.
 Các quyết định và lệnh trên đã được Viện KSND cùng cấp phê chuẩn.
 Ông P.V.H. đã bị tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân. Ông này từng mang cấp hàm Thượng tá, nguyên là phó khoa của trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân, trụ sở ở TP.HCM.
 Bước đầu, ông P. đã thừa nhận có hành vi mua bán dâm đối với bé gái 15 tuổi.
 Ngày 3/11, trường Đại học Cảnh sát nhân dân đã có thông báo gửi đến công an các đơn vị, một số địa phương, học viện, trường, bệnh viện CAND về việc kỷ luật cán bộ. 
 Theo thông báo, vị phó khoa này bị kỷ luật bằng hình thức “tước danh hiệu Công an nhân dân” từ ngày 1/11.
 Vụ án đang được Cơ quan CSĐT Công an TP.HCM mở rộng điều tra.

 We are flying out of Ho Chi Min on the 3rd of Jan late in the day so we were hoping to spend new years somewhere else, maybe Phu Quoc or does anyone have any other recommendations for South Vietnam? We don't want to be stuck on the streets with millions of people so either a big beach style party or something really elegant maybe, a resort with events would work also but I can't seem to find anything specific.

I'm a man. Otherwise healthy although I have had my blood pressure tested in the moderate to high zone at times, although other times it was normal. Not sure if I had nerves at the exam, but it has come out high in some exams. Not sure if I have any other issues. I can teach 12 hours straight if necessary, not sure why we need a confirmation of what can be seen, but what could get my visa not renewed? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So over the past few months I've seen so many news like "bright spots on the VN economy" both online and on TV. I don't know exactly how impactful is the recession on the lives of most people, but I heard some ppl say it is probably worse than on TV because there's more job layoffs. Just curious, how impactful is it ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I received a call informing me that the train I was traveling on SP3 had been cancelled, and my ticket would now be changed to SP1. I also received a text message, and I had no suspicion at the time.
 Just now, someone called me and asked me where I was. He said he would meet me at the Hanoi station and put me on the train. I thought to myself: The service of Vietnam Railway is really good.
 After I entered Hanoi Station, I found that the sp3 train had not been cancelled. There were many people in the train, and I could tell at a glance that they were also tourists. At the same time, I saw the person who called me. He was wearing a "xx travel" T-shirt but not the blue uniform of the Vietnam Railway . He put me on the train and told me he was sorry. I think I roughly understood it, and I didn't expose him. I didn't suffer any loss, and I knew that he was just an ordinary office worker who just wanted to complete his work.
 I guess maybe more people joined the tour group, but they didn’t have enough train tickets, so they randomly selected a few lucky passengers like us and lied to them. This should be something that tour groups operate and Vietnam Railways acquiesces to.

Getting the later flights allowed me to return home from work to collect luggage and then be on the island in good time. 
 However more recently I wanted to go back and found myself completely unable to find any flight that flies after 6.45pm. I checked multiple airlines, even seeing if booking a month or two made any difference. I couldn’t find anything. 
 Anyone got any idea what the hell is happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently in hcmc and it’s my first week in Vietnam so excuse my lack of cultural wit.
 Today I was trying to park my bike and a random looking guy showed up. He started scribbling something on a piece of paper so I assumed he wanted to charge me for the parking. I told him to show me some kind of ID but he wouldn’t so I told him to get lost and just left the bike there. On my way back I realised he’s moved the bike to the middle of the road. I’ve got a few questions:
  
Do these people charge money for parking?
 
If so, on what basis? Like, do they own the parking spaces?
 
If they do charge, do I just trust any random looking dude here and hand them in my money?
 
What is his job exactly, how does anyone benefit from his services?
 
 Also I do apologise if I just broke some social standards. The only similar experience I’ve had was in Naples where local drug addicts demand money for parking, and I’ve been advised by my Italian friend to just ignore them. I would really like to know how to deal with this here in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think you guys could relate to this.
 Growing we’ve all probably heard some variation of this. Where your parents would stop you from misbehaving by saying “oh if you don’t do this, a cop will arrest you” or “if you don’t stop doing this, that man over there will kidnapped you”.
 I thought that that kind of parenting was something that is long gone by time our generation came around. 
 But lo and behold, just this evening while I was enjoying a drink a mother near me was trying to get her daughter to eat. Now I wasn’t paying attention because it wasn’t my business… until the mother looks over at me and said “if you don’t eat that man will kidnapped you”. I was the only other customer there so I knew for a fact she was talking about me.
 And I just… didn’t know what to do or say, I just look over at them surprise for a few second while she continue, saying how I’m gonna do it and where I’ll take her
 I paid and left pretty quickly after that but how do you responded to something like that? WHY are we still doing something like that?!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of October 31, 2023. Prime Video became unavailable to Vietnam users. Refund will be sent to subscribers. 
  
"Unplugging Prime Video: The What and The Why Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming arm, has been a part of Vietnam’s digital entertainment spectrum since 2016. The service, akin to Netflix, brought a plethora of international films and TV shows to Vietnamese screens. But come October 2023, active subscriptions will be cancelled, and full refunds will be issued. Additionally, Prime Gaming benefits will also become inaccessible.
  
While Amazon remains silent on the rationale behind this closure, industry insiders speculate Vietnamese regulations may hold the key. The country mandates transnational paid broadcasting services to obtain licenses—a hurdle that Amazon seems unwilling to surmount. However, this is merely conjecture in the absence of an official explanation."

 I took the train from Saigon to Nam Dinh. When I arrived in Da Nang, the song "Đà Nẵng trong tim tôi" was played on the train. So what song will be played on the train when I arrive in Hanoi or Saigon?

 I’m on cat ba island from 16th until 20th and I need a strong and secure WiFi connection to try and get tickets to a festival that usually sells out very quickly (Glastonbury festival). 
 It looks like the hostel we are staying in has poor WiFi, so does anyone know the best spots for strong WiFi on the island? Any good hotels or internet cafes? We’re thinking of checking into an Airbnb with private WiFi on the final night just to see if it’ll help our chances of getting a ticket. 
 Any advice welcome! Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm a European guy who recently travelled in Vietnam for a month.
 On one day I decided to travel on my motorbike to a nearby town that wasn't touristy at all, because I wanted to see more of the real Vietnamese life.
 I ended up sitting in a cafe with a Vietnamese stranger. We drank coffee, smoked, talked through translate and had fun. I'm 19, he's 27 with a young child if that matters.
 We ended up meeting again, travelling around and he showed me some sights. At the end of the day he insisted I slept at his house. Here I sat with him and his younger brother, we talked and eventually I went to sleep.
 Next day, I have to leave early to book a bus. My Vietnamese friend/host also had to leave early. When I was about to leave I saw a woman and I asked him if that's his mom. He said yes.
 I told him I wanted to go thank her for letting me stay at her house. He declined. I insisted. He declined again, he seemed to really not want me to do that.
 His mom, who seemed to me doing some chores, didn't acknowledge me at all, not even look at me.
 I found this super weird. Why was this the case?
 I'm not sure if this is a personal thing or could have to do with Vietnamese culture. Maybe I did something wrong. If it has to do with culture, do you know why this happened?

I stayed 2 nights in Ha-long bay and four nights in Hanoi old quarter. The people of your country are some of the warmest people I have met in my life, your roads are so clean, and even though you feel you will be run over people coolly navigate around you. No one is rude to you on the other hand I was helped by locals from falling into a tourist trap, every country had good and bad people. The majority of your country had great people with big hearts. You don’t disrespect neither do you have a demeanor where someone can try to undermine or disrespect you, maybe the years of war and made you so strong yet so humble. Money is the basis of all economies yet in your country, majority folk don’t give it the importance it’s given the world over. Food was so fresh and the amount of fruits you eat and the fresh seafood shows on your flawless skins. The women take the cake in hard work and yet manage to look so elegant in whatever they wear, they are such boss ladies it’s commendable. There are other countries in South Asia which have built economies on sex work, yet yours keeps its head held high and aims to give a more wholesome experience to any visitor.
 I write this from my bed in India, sad and depressed at having come back from such a lovely country which I wish was like my second home!
 Thank you Vietnam 🇻🇳 🙏🏻

It was pointed out that this building did not meet JITCO regulations even before it was built, but this company stated that this was not a problem because Vietnamese people live in worse conditions in their home countries. But the regulation that the minimum bedroom size per person should be 4.5 m2 on average was established. In response to this issue this company made a donation of 4 million to Yoshitaka Shindo. As a result, this rule was changed and the aforementioned building is no longer in violation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never like taking taxis anyway, I usually use Grab but my mom is a little more old-fashioned so whenever I’m traveling with her at the Tan Son Nhat airport she insists on using a taxi. She is Native Viet and I am Việt kiều. 
 First time, they scammed us to pay double/triple a normal fare price (and I know taxis to and from airport are already higher end, so it was double that price already). 
 Second time I gave them the hotel address, which was a chain hotel. Dude didn’t want to drive across town and said this particular chain accepts any reservation at any of their locations so he dropped us off at the hotel chain spot close to the hotel. I was already suspicious when he said this, but my mom accepted it readily and didn’t argue. She’s been living in Vietnam for over two years now for retirement and also grew up here, so if she thought it was fine I wasn’t going to argue either, especially since I was exhausted from a long flight. Obviously it turned out not to be true and the hotel receptionist said as much and called us a cab to our actual hotel reservation. 
 Even after these two incidents my mom still goes to the taxis when leaving the airport as she says there are no other options. However, to book a Grab car to pickup from airport you just have to walk to the airport parking lot and they’ll pick you up from there. She struggles with technology and apps though and still feels more comfortable using the taxis even knowing they’re overpriced and scammy. But for anyone who’s comfortable with using apps and booking a Grab, go for that option. Teach the older folk how to use it too. These taxis are atrocious.

It’s one the greatest embarrassment this country has to offer. Custom and Border officers truly brought great shame. One dude looks like he’s day drunk, the other officer cleared 3-4 people while he cleared only one. Elderly people and crying babies standing in line for hours. Every officers look visibly pissed off. What a great way to welcome foreigners to our country. This officer got my blood boiling when he physically push a Japanese tourist back in line, the tourist was simply chatting with his group because they have to wait 2 hours in line. He later show extreme irritation to the dude, slam his passport on the table in a rude manner. The Japanese tourist was in shock. Godd!!! It pissed me off everytime I land in this god forsaken ass place. Not to mention getting a taxi out of the airport. It’s extremely chaotic, unorganized, and everything is in disorder with no clear direction. Im amazed people still visit this country. Because that is some of the shittiest welcome any country could ever give.

My mother and some of my co-worker shows disdain towards them for whatever reason? When I probed my mom about it, the reason she stated for hating Indians is that they’re “stinky” and that “they are all thieves”, which I kinda don’t buy that line of reasoning. Anyone else experience similar things or do I just happen to live around particularly racists folks?
 Edit: thank you all for the replies, reading them was very…. enlightening. Needless to say, I think I’ve been rather naive with my ways of thinking thus far, thank you all for informing me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: I am leaving. Perhaps with a different company, or if there were a different demographic of people in my tour group, I would have stuck it out, but my gut is telling me to leave. Some odd things have happened that are not just related to the party culture. These people are racist. Guys, always trust your gut.
 Hi all, I (20F, poc) scheduled a Ha Giang easy rider loop tour through a hostel after all the rave reviews online. I arrive, and quickly realize that this is all just one big excuse for young white European people to drink and party. I felt extremely uncomfortable my first night here, before the tour starts, as I did not come to Vietnam to drink with strangers, don’t like these people in my group, and am uninterested in the tourist drinking and partying scene. I don’t know why I didn’t do better research to see what a terrible tourist trap Ha Giang has become. I wanted a beautiful nature motorbike tour, but I am thinking of canceling because I don’t want to drink and don’t want to be the only person of color in the group, already half-excluded.
 Has anyone felt the same way when visiting Southeast Asia, and how did you avoid this? I’m here to travel solo, decompress, enjoy nature and different cities and locals, not interested in making friends with other tourists.
 And now, I’m not sure what to do. Is the loop still worth it if I don’t want to party at night and just feel uncomfortable with the people in my group? I’m thinking of just bailing and going back to Hanoi, which I loved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all heard of those family feuds over property, right? Well me and my mom thought about it and we’d like to avoid just that in the future. 
 Backstory: my mom is Vietnamese but lives in Sweden. Her brother is holding either half (or on the contract, currently holding) her house for her until she retires and moves there in the future. Now grown up and having seen my family members patterns, I’m almost too sure that a conflict will arise in the future from this. Mainly between my moms brother, and his wife. The two aren’t too fond of each other. Another red flag I noticed during a trip to VN one summer was that my uncle started tearing up and making a whole scene in front of everyone when my mom just calmly asked for her name to also be included on the papers for the house. He was screaming about being accused of being greedy when no one approached it that way. I felt like he was scared and projecting. 
 Any advice is appreciated. I’d hate to see my family members fight over four walls in the future. 
 PS. This property was gifted to specifically my mom from her parents. My grandparents made sure each one of their kids got a retirement property.

 Parents "protect" their own heads but not their own childrens. Yesterday during a massive downpour of rain, a father sat comfortably in his helmet and raincoat while his daughter sat on the back, cold, wet and at risk of head injury should they crash.
 At least for me, if there is only one helmet, my passenger gets it. 
 if there is one raincoat and we can't share, my passenger gets it. 
 I honestly can't imagine a world where you love your children but won't sacrifice a helmet or raincoat for them.

 I've tried Phu Tho in District 10 and it was great the 1st time but then the 2nd time some lady said I had to rent it out just to shoot around on a court that was empty and dark with no lighting. 
 There's another court called Seventy Seven and that one was pretty cool but it looked more of a "friends getting together and pitching in to play" type of deal. It didn't have a very "pick up" style feel to it at all. 
 There is a gymnasium in District 3 and you need to rent that one out as well. Apparently, the Ho Chi Minh City Wings play at this location. 
 I haven't even looked at District 1 yet, but I'm starting to kind of feel you need to rent a whole court out to get anything going.
 Maybe we can get a group going of at least 10 of us getting together to rent a court out together. I'm just trying to run 5 vs 5 for an hour or so to get a good work out in. 
 I'm going to try Phu Tho again because today might have just been a wierd off day as last time I was there, it actually felt like a normal park where people just rolled up and started playing pick up.
 I know basketball is not very big in Vietnam but for a developing city with 9 million people in it, I expected more out of the basketball community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I randomly saw a video (fb) inwhich a guy (called Bino) was shocked when he saw a customer make $21k monthly. And here go the comments.
 The first one: "it is normal in America for ppl to makes 6 figures annually"
 The second one: "my ex make $100k monthly" lol wtf
 From what I've heard, the medium-high salary for a Vietnamese person and an American are $1000 and $4000, respectively, but I might be wrong. I just curious what the average income in Vietnam and in big cities (in Vietnam) is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I share the same sentiment. And I was born and raised in Vietnam. Every once in a while you run into someone who’s kinda old, but not that old, and you don’t know if you should call them anh or chú. 
 Same with the women: idk if they’re old enough for me to call them cô or chị without offending them
 Edit: Just remembered something else about pronouns so figured I’ll blow y’all mind. 
 Within the family tree of Vietnam, you call your cousins anh/chị/em, not based on age but based on your parents age. In other words, if my father has a younger brother, and they both have children, my uncle’s kid would have to call me anh/chị regardless of age. This means it is possible that I am anh/chị even if I’m the younger cousin!!
 Another thing is if within a family tree, a person is on the same generation as your parents, you call them cô/dì/chú/bác. So for a large family with 1st generation of 5, it is possible to have some people of the 2nd generation younger than some people in the 3rd generation!! But the people in the 3rd generation still have to call the 2nd gen people cô dì chú bác cậu mợ, regardless of age

 Found happiness for a part we seldom knew,
 Amidst lush landscapes and cultures so grand,
 His Anus danced with joy in this distant land.
 Bidets and bum guns, a revelation sweet,
 Made cleanliness a daily, pleasant treat,
 No more rough paper, it was all so clean,
 In Vietnam, his rear was like a gleam.
 But fate can twist a traveler's joy to pain,
 As food, exotic, brought discomfort's reign,
 A dodgy dish, it left him in despair,
 And his happy Anus turned grumpy with a glare.
 In moments of delight and sudden strife,
 A traveler's tale unfolds in life,
 From happiness to grump, a twist so stark,
 In Vietnam, his Anus found a journey marked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm potentially moving to District 1 in HCMC, depending on the work visa stuff. I should be getting a little bit higher salary, but the condos seem so much more expensive that it might not even make sense.
 I'm looking around at condos just through google search (DotProperty, RentApartmentVN, etc) and I haven't seen anything for less than $390. Or around 10 million VND. These condos look like normal condos, with no furniture and maybe a swimming pool. In Bangkok I've got a normal condo, that came with furniture and swimming pool and gym for $280/month.
 It's hard for me to believe that HCMC is that much more expensive than BKK but I really don't know. I've seen people here say with $300 you could rent a mansion, but I'm not seeing anything like that all, not do I want a mansion. Just a 1 bedroom studio with a pool or gym or some kind of recreational thing to do at the condo, or in the area for around $300 USD, maybe around 8M VND, is that's reasonable. 
 Is HCMC really that much more expensive in terms of renting a condo? Or am I just looking in the wrong places?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm taking a Vietnamese class in the US and my teacher said that for 3rd person pronouns we can use "đó" instead of "ấy." As in "cô đó mua xe hơi" translating to "she buys a car," and "anh đó có phải là kỹ sư không?" translating to "is he an engineer?". She said "cô đó" would be used more in the south than "cô ấy" as a 3rd person pronoun. 
 I was wondering if this is correct or maybe I am misunderstanding her explanation? (Her English is a bit difficult to understand sometimes.)
 For some background info, my teacher is in her late 60s and moved to the US in her 20s from central/southern Viet Nam. She is trying to teach the southern accent/dialect, but our textbook is Northern so it is confusing sometimes. 
 TLDR: Is "cô đó" the southern equivalent of "cô ấy" as a 3rd person pronoun?

 Do doctors usually have a decent salary/earning in Vietnam?

We’ll be visiting Ha long city for just an overnight and we’ll be staying around the Quang Ninh area near the Tuan Chau bridge, aside from taking a ferry to Cat Ba Island though will only probably do it for a nice view of the ocean and bay and then be back again to the town since we can’t ride a motorbike to explore the island. What else can we do around the town? Is there any cool cafes there? :) 
 also, will probably just chill at the beach admiring the view haha

 I want to ask those who had a chance to study abroad for such amount of time and/or live in Germany: Does it worth it? Can it really change yourself a whole lot, in terms of thinking, studying, relationships, etc? Can this experience somehow be helpful for some of my future plans like looking for Masters scholarships abroad or working in an international environment?

 Given that there are at least 2 million people belonging to either the military or the police, don't they ever think 'man, why can't I at least go to Thailand for a fun weekend'?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a high school student, currently 12th grade.
 I have been struggling with school ever since 7th grade, and as far as it seems, it is only getting worse over time.
 I believe that I may have ADHD, or something of sort related to mentality. But I cannot confirm yet without a proper doctor checkup.
 I am too afraid to talk with my parents about it, as they are very keen on education, and I am scared that they would constantly scold me and make it worse if I were to talk to them about it.
 Right now, I don't have any motivation to continue school. The first mid-semester exam is coming and I cannot focus on a single thing for even a second.
 What can I do to help myself? Or what should I do to make my parents be understanding about my situation, and potentially do something about it?
 Any help will be appreciated.

 Question on my learning VN 
 If I ask a question I put “phải không” at the end of it. 
 While learning I found that its not necessary to use phải and you can use không? When should I be using không versus phải không when learning Vietnamese when asking a question. 
 Examples:
 Lily muốn pho phai khong? Does Lily want noodles?
 Lily muốn pho khong? 
 Does the above still work?

I’ve seen the sights including Ha Long Bay. I’m looking for suggestions on other things to do in the city. I’ll head out of town for Sa Pa and Ninh Binh. Not sure about Ha Giang loop as I’ll be alone. I’m sticking to the north this trip though possibly a few days in Da Nang. I have a couple friends there but will be on my own very often. I’m an older (60s), gay male.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am việt kiều in Eastern Europe. My dad’s Vietnamese and my mom is Eastern European.
 A year ago, I relocated to Vietnam to work in my dad’s company. I met this Vietnamese guy in the business meeting of my dad. Both of us are into each other. Although I look more like a Slavic person, I am always more attracted to Vietnamese people. He’s literally my type. I still have to travel between my mom’s country and Vietnam, and he’s busy, so we only see each other twice per month. Everytime we met, he still bought gifts for me. I also gave something back to him.
 I told him I consider buying a car , because I’ld settle down here in Hanoi. Then, two weeks later, a new Mercedes was sent to my apartment . Now, I have no idea how to buy something back to him. That Mercedes is worth over 2 billions VND. I don’t have billions to spend on a gift. 
 My dad always teaches me “never take anything for free in Vietnam”. I can’t ask my dad for much money though. We are just dating, and I am not his wife. It’s weird for me to receive a big gift like that. Luckily, I don’t live with my dad’s family. They haven’t know about this car yet.

 So I'm pretty stoked I get to go back to Vietnam I haven't been on an international flight since pre covid! 
 Last time I was there I injured myself and couldn't do the loop, however since I'm taking my girlfriend and it's her first time there the loop is my number 1 priority! Plus it'll be my 30th bday! 
 So my question is, where can I book that you'd recommend? She wants to use an easy rider I want to ride my own bike. I cant find any option to choose an easy rider or not online. So where can I do this? 
 Lastly what is needed for the loop? We have our health insurance that would cover leisure etc. Is there anything else? 
 Thanks in advance everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if my question is phrased wrongly, but I do not know how to phrase it better. As a westerner (or in this case, a person born from Vietnamese parents, but raised in the US), I never really engaged with the Vietnamese language and many of its cultural products (other than the food, but that is a given). 
 I never really watch any Vietnamese shows or musics because it looked poorly made compared with other things, like American/Western sitcoms and anime. And looking at the posts on this subreddit, I see that the younger generation of Vietnam is also seem to take more interest in K-Pop, Anime, and other cultural media than their home media. So in that case, why should I take time to learn Vietnamese to engage with the media that even the younger generation seems to not take interest in? 
 I know this question sounds superficial (and it is) and there are many reasons to learn Vietnamese (talk to relatives and the people of Vietnam, learn the ethmology/history of the language, just have knowledge of Vietnamese under your belt, etc. ), but many times the reason why a person learns about a culture and the language of that culture is because they engage with something in the culture that sparks them to learn more about the culture. But I do not see that spark personally. Vietnamese is not the spoken language in the world (meaning it is not really a global business language), doesn't really have a huge art/film scene, and vietnamese culture in general does not really spark a huge influence across the globe. So why should I learn Vietnamese?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dragon also represents the emperor in China. A lot of Vietnamese mythological creatures are not distinctly Vietnamese. Are there any traditional royal and national symbols that Vietnam doesn't share with East Asia? Only Nghê and Lạc bird come to mind so far but they don't symbolize Vietnam as well as the dragon.
 Imagine if you are creating a new national flag or national emblem for Vietnam with more traditional elements, how do you make it so that it won't be confused with Chinese symbols?

 Main Worries: - Is there anything I’ve missed that I should include like Dalat or Hue? 
  
Is going to Ha Giang after Ninh Binh repetitive? We are planning to motorbike in both places, but I am debating cutting out the 3 day Ninh Binh leg as both might be too similar
  
Thanks! 
 Hanoi - 3 Days
 Ning Binh (including Tam Coc and Trang An) - 3 Days
 Ha Giang Loop - 3/4 days
 Da Nang and Hoi An - 4/5 Days
 Phong Nha Cave Trekking - 3 Days with Oxalis

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, my partner booked a flight to Singapore from Ho chi Minh and we are trying to change the flight dates a family member has fallen ill. 
 When we tried to change the dates this was not allowed on the website and we contacted costumer support. Unfortunately they told us we couldn't change the dates as we had "booked" our flights through an agency, which is not the case. We have an email confirming our booking through Vietnam airlines only. 
 They told us the name agency apparently being Aberdeen (with that being the only name they had) and that was it. We asked if they could forward us the confirmation they had on their side from such agency and they said they couldn't do that because it was with another department. We tried googling such agency and nothing comes up and again we don't have the confirmation from such agency either. We tried to argue we have not booked through an agency and again she refused to help us as she said we had booked through this so called agency that does not exist. 
 We are 100% sure we booked with Vietnam airlines and we don't know what to do now. We have contacted the other department she mentioned but there's only an email we could contact. 
 It feels like we are being scammed by the airline and not being helped. 
 Has anyone had this issue before?
 Update: We were able to change it through this new email we received. Someone in the comments mentioned there's an Aberdeen based Vietnam airlines which would make sense for why this happened. They are trying to charge us the equivalent of a new flight now though... So we are going to book with another airline. Good luck to whomever is having this issue in the future

 Nhưng đêm qua nó kể mình nghe, trong lòng nó vẫn chưa nguôi uất ức. Nó bị mấy thằng bạn chọc là chó lông xù, đừng chọc nó, nó cắn giờ.
 Mình hỏi rồi em làm thế nào, nó trả lời em im vì đáp trả là tụi nó chọc tới.
 Có ai bảo vệ em không? Không, mà có một lúc có đứa con gái định lên tiếng chọc nhưng có đứa khác ngăn lại.
 Xoã tóc - một hành động hết sức bình thường. Nhưng dưới tác động của bạo lực ngôn từ, hành động xoã tóc lại trở nên khó khăn với em mình hơn bao giờ hết. Nó không muốn xoã tóc đi học nữa, vì sợ bị bạn chọc. Cũng có lúc, từ việc yêu mái tóc xoăn xù tự nhiên, nó chán ghét và muốn duỗi thẳng tóc mình. Đó cũng là lí do em mình muốn lên chuyên, một môi trường khác vì “ở đó không ai nói, ko chê cũng ko khen mái tóc của em, nhưng ít nhất là không chê”. Cho nên em thoải mái xoã tóc khi đi ôn ở chuyên buổi chiều.
 --------
 Đặt bản thân chúng ta trong hoàn cảnh bị bắt nạt, nếu có người đứng lên vì mình, đứng về phía mình, bảo vệ mình, chúng ta sẽ ổn hơn nhiều đúng ko?
 mình hỏi em là mình đăng bài phốt tụi bạn lên fb được ko? em không chịu vì không muốn những người bắt nạt em đọc được. em muốn mình đăng nó lên insta để tìm sự đồng cảm, thấu hiểu từ bạn bè. tâm lý chung là vậy hay sao mn?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I am writing a Vietnamese character into my historical fiction story. It takes place in the 1920’s-40’s era and I’d love to get advice/opinions/resources for research on this character. I want her family to have moved to the USA when she was young (maybe around 12? She was born in 1892) But I’d love to know what kind of traditions the family might follow and bring with them to the states, what immigration was like at the time, etc. I know there were immigration rules in place at the time that might affect them and France was involved in colonialism in Vietnam at the time. I’ve had trouble finding any information on Vietnamese immigration to the USA before the war. I’d also like to be told about any history I should know that would affect this story, what people want me as a white writer to avoid when making a Vietnamese character, and what people want to see when it comes to Vietnamese women in fiction. So far I have her name as Chau Tahn Liên and I’ve named a few of her family members like her brothers, sister, parents, aunt and uncle, cousin, and paternal grandparents. I’d love to know if the name makes sense especially for the time or if i should make changes and what they should be. If you take the time to read and respond to this I want to say thank you in advance. I can explain more of her character to what people ask.

We’ll be staying in Sa Pa for 2 days (more or less), and we’re looking for a trekking route to do that is not crowded. In fact, we’re looking for a medium-hard trekking (we’re young and fit) where we’re not gonna be surrounded by tons of people. Is it possible to sleep in the mountain with a tent? Is it too cold or illegal? Thanks a lot!

She's been the best woman I've ever dated - but there is one thing that is getting in the way, and has suddenly become an issue. She has an aversion to splitting the bill. She has paid for dates before on a few occasions (in fact, she paid for our first one), but I would say it's 90-10 in terms of costs between her and I. I was told this was the norm in Vietnam for dating...but is it always? What about for long-term relationships or marriage?
 Recently, I broached the issue. We agreed to go to a restaurant, but I would meet her at her place before doing so (in the past, we have usually just met directly at the place or met at her's…]]></summary>

Getting some conflicting things from google - some sites say snow banana but others say snow banana plants don’t produce fruit so I’m not sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m traveling solo to Vietnam soon and I like to have my pictures taken by someone (white b*tch instagram thingy, sorry). When I visited Korea, people were very happy to help me with it and they often took their time to get the best shot, which was very surprising to me! How is it in Vietnam though? Have you ever had any experience with such situation? 
 PS. Of course I would never ask for it in places, in which it would be considered inappropriate. I don’t want to offend anyone’s culture, I just want to appreciate the beauty of it!

 I've been there twice (to give it a a second chance) and both times I absolutely hated it.
 What's enjoyable about being packed like sardines in a can under a plastic cover while eating with sand flying everywhere?
 Why not eat and drink away from the sand and let people who actually use the beach have the space for some fun?
 Look at Da Nang, it's a much better experience, why is Vung Tau so different?

She insisted that one of the 100k dong bill is a 10k dong bill, and she get a 200k dong bill in my wallet and returned my "110k dong". It was so fast and I was so distracted with her actions (she told me, try her other goods blah blah). When I counted my money, a 100k dong was missing.. I went back to her and she just plainly ignored me.. 
 Left a really bad impression. I've been traveling for many years, and only India and Vietnam, I was shamelessly scammed..
 The almonds I bought left a really bad taste in my mouth..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be traveling Vietnam for the first time next year as a Viet kieu (pretty fluent in Vietnamese). I will be there for 3 weeks with arrival in Saigon and departure in Hanoi.
 I’m open to feedback on my itinerary from all of you travel experts/expats/locals. I have zero expectation on following this itinerary 100% since I know that’s not feasible and unforeseen situations may arise. I like to have my days planned out so that I’m not scratching my head on what to do when I get there.
 I enjoy food as you can tell from the amount of food tours but also enjoy activities and nature/scenery. If you have any recommendations outside of what is on my itinerary, please share. All recommendations for attractions/restaurants/coffee shops/street food/shopping centers/markets would be appreciated. Also if you guys know of any pedestrian friendly/walking areas that are not on my itinerary, please let me know. I like to explore on foot but also know that Vietnam is not the most walk friendly country.
 Is 3 days too long for Ninh Binh? I like that cycling is a great option to explore the area but will I run out of things to do?
 Thanks in advance

 Our friends lives in the same Western country as we do. Which makes deciding the amount even harder. What would be a reasonable amount in Vietnam might be a low amount in our country.

 They gross me out, so I'm almost definitely overreacting but I just can't stand them.
 Anyway, I reported this to the reception and they said as it's rainy season (there has been heavy rain in the last few weeks) it's likely they've come up through the toilet/drain.
 Is this actually something that happens?
 They've offered to change our room in the morning to a higher floor, presumably with less chance of them coming up through the drains.
 Wondering if there is any point in doing this?
 I guess I'm really wondering if this is something the hotel can't help/has no power over or if I should be looking at this another way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Since I bought my plane ticket I’ve been lurking here a bit. My friend (45m) and I (40m) are coming to Vietnam from about Jan 1 to Jan 31. 
 Neither of us like planning much so right now I’m inclined to just book a hotel or air b and b for 7 days to start in HCMC and figure out the rest after we get there. 
 We will probably bounce over to Thailand for a few days, maybe Cambodia and Laos and I have to pop up to Hong Kong to see a friend for a few days. 
 Mostly we just want to explore and eat, maybe do some light hikes and we’ll probably both spend a decent amount of time alone. 
 Is it pretty easy to work stuff out after we get there?
 Also, kinda random but is Amex accepted pretty widely there? I have other cards, but I prefer to use that one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend recently obtained a Vietnamese passport in the United States for the first time as a Viet Kieu. 
 Now they need to travel to Vietnam to receive an "entry stamp" as proof of entering the country with their Vietnamese passport. 
 This is necessary for applying for temporary residence and eventually obtaining their CCCD/CMND. 
 The Vietnamese passport has been mailed to Vietnam and is currently in their possession. 
 They initially entered Vietnam using their American passport. 
 Now they are wondering about the next steps. 
 Should they exit Vietnam using their American passport, enter Cambodia using their Vietnamese passport, and then re-enter Vietnam with the Vietnamese passport?
 Alternatively, should they exit Vietnam with their American passport, enter Cambodia with the American passport, exit Cambodia with the American passport, and then enter Vietnam (via a border run) with the Vietnamese passport? 
 The situation is quite confusing, and any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just finished reading Viet Thanh Nguyen's "The Committed", and I was intrigued (and a little frightened) by this photo he had featured in the book. I still haven't found the photo's source after many Google searches and carefully looking through the book's acknowledgements. My only "lead" is Viet Thanh Nguyen mentioning certain people in his acknowledgements who helped him secure permission from the Union Générale des Vietnamiens de France to use the photo in his book. I really am curious as to what the story behind that photo is and would eventually like to learn more about the protests/rallies of the Vietnamese community in Paris.
 Any help would go a long way! (And perhaps help me sleep better since my curiosity's been keeping me up!)
 EDIT: From the man himself. Shoutout to u/Commercial_Ad707 for suggesting I reach out to Professor Nguyen!

 My Vietnamese is low right now, but I translated the words above the picture and it says something about learning. But, the Christian, flaming Bible seems weird in a public school. I asked my TA about it and she didn't have answers. 
 I know Christianity exists in Vietnam, there's a Catholic church very close to my apartment and I've seen Mormans about. However, I never expected to see this kind of thing here.
 Can anyone shed some light on what's up with this? Is this common? Is it meant to be Christian propaganda? Is the picture irrelevant? Is it even allowed in a public school? I'm confused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am researching the history of Chinese character education (giáo dục chữ Hán) and Literary Chinese education (giáo dục Hán văn) in Vietnam and was wondering if anyone has any articles or journals (English or Vietnamese) about Chinese character education in South Vietnam (1955-1975; Việt Nam Cộng hoà). I have read several articles in English and Vietnamese, and apparently, there were classes in South Vietnam until 1975. But I could not find detailed information on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Allowing drivers to turn left across opposing lane on solid green lights is a mistake in VN.
 I believe this idea was inspired by the similar traffic law in the US, except we're forgetting one thing: Vietnamese doesn't understand the "right of way".
 This, together with the law of turning right on red were created to allow more efficiency for all drivers. But this works only if drivers are YIELDING for the opposing traffic, not crowding in the middle of opposing lane inching towards every space they see. The mentalities of giving the right of way & yielding obviously don't exist in Vietnam, so why implement it because it just makes things worse?
 We simply aren't ready for it, mentally and morally. Or worse, we won't admit it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm planning to travel to Vietnam during december 2023 - january 2024 for a three weeks period.
 During my travel, I want to explore the Mekong Delta region and cities such as Can Tho, Chau Doc, Long Xuyen, Ca Mau and Ha Tien during a three weeks period.
 I wonder if it's doable on a 50cc scooter (like a honda chaly or a similar scooter) or if it's preferable to do it on a bike. (I do a lot of bike and bikepacking in France so I'm pretty ok with that).
 I didn't have any driver licence so I can't rent a powerful motorbike, and I don't want to have any issues with the local police
 I'm also planning to stay in "homestay" like; guesthouses; etc
 So I had a few questions:
 -Can I find a long-term (3 weeks) for a 50cc scooter in Ho Chi Minh City or maybe buy one ? I wonder what's the best solution.
 -Did the road/dirt road are practicable on a 50cc scooter or a bike ?
 -Did you have any advice about the project ?
 I already look on internet, but I can't find so much infos on the Mekong Delta and backpacking it.
 Thanks all for your answers !
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 I’m traveling to Vietnam in late November for about 11 days total. I’ll be spending 5 days in Hanoi and 6 days in HCMC. I’ve been to both cities previously, as well as Da Nang & Hue. So I’ve basically seen most of the touristy stuff there (including Ha Long Bay) and have decided to skip central VietNam entirely this time around.
 I’m thinking of making a side trip to Sapa while up north and potentially Da Lat or the Mekong delta while in HCMC. 
 Is two days in Sapa enough time to see most things there or should I add an extra day? Is Da Lat worth checking out for two days or so? How about the Mekong delta? I know both cities are pretty touristy and I can live with that. I just want to check out new places and get out of the hustle of the big cities. 
 Since I’ve done Hanoi and HCMC, I just plan on chilling, eating while there so my days spent in the smaller cities is flexible. 
 Also, I know the weather is hot/humid year round, but should I expect rain during this time of year?
 Thanks for any suggestions or recommendations!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m adopted and recently reconnected with my birth family. My boyfriend and I are staying with my birth mother right now. we had plans to leave at the end of this week. 
 A couple of days ago we were put on the spot and invited to a wedding, of who I now know is my birth mothers half sisters daughter(I found out the relation a couple days ago). We were planning on leaving before but they really wanted us to come so we said we could stay till the wedding. The bride wants us to be part of the wedding party (bridesmaid/groomsmen). I had only met her once before this. It’s very kind of them to invite us. I’ve read other things on Reddit about wedding gift giving and if you’re family or friends.
 We weren’t expecting this event at all. 
 What should we expect and how much money should we give as a gift?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I studied abroad in America for four years. I completed my bachelor's degree in Marketing and Data Analytics in 2021, and I got a job in the US in 2022. I was on STEM OPT, and my employer was willing to sponsor my H1-B visa. 
 Things were looking up for a bit, and I thought I could settle in America. However, my health worsened in September 2022, and I was constantly sick every month. I got a serious case of vertigo that made me spend a day in the ER in August. And then, a month later I got diagnosed with H Pylori, a nasty stomach virus that could cause severe heartburn. In December 2022, I got Covid after attending happy hour with my coworkers. I had to deal with all of these along with anxiety and depression. In March 2023, I decided to quit my job and move back to Vietnam because I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't even apply for the STEM extension or participate in the H1-B lottery. 
 I moved to Saigon after coming back to Vietnam (I'm from Hanoi), but I still feel like a loser for coming back to Vietnam. When I set out to study in America, my goal was to get a job and a green card and then I would choose where to live. However, things didn't go as planned, and I am completely lost. I am scared of getting back into the corporate world because of what happened to me. I'm scared that my health will be in jeopardy again. I'm still looking and applying for jobs right now, but deep down I wish no one would hire me so that I could rest for a bit more. 
 Now I'm completely lost because the goal that I had been working towards for 5+ years was squashed, and now I have no goals or directions. If anyone could just slap me out of this confusing stage of life, please do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! Just wondering if I did something wrong 4 weeks ago. I'm still pondering about it till this day. We moved in a hotel in the tourist area for a month and almost every night at this outside Huda bar there was a white puppy sitting on a folding chair. He had a leash and tip jar next to him and I would always go up and pet him (I asked if I could pet him every time). And I fell in love with the little guy. So one day I went to the pet store near by and bought some puppy sized toys to give to him. When I saw the puppy again a few days later I patted him and gave him a rope toy to play with and we tugged it and all that cute stuff. I left him with the toy and saw the puppy about a week later without it. I never saw him since then. Is it bad here to gift a dog a toy? I had no bad intent or anything I just wanted to treat him. :(

 Do you know about 'pod chill' in Vietnam? I thought it was a regular vape given to me by someone, and after inhaling it 8-9 times, I collapsed. What is this? Is it synthetic weed? 
 I'm really worried 
 Are there people around who do this a lot(8-9times)? 
 I'm very concerned about possible brain damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in VN as foreigner. I know that vietnamese love karaoke and it's fine. Until they crank up the volume to absolutely outrageous level.
 I live in a very good place and very nice city, but unfortunately to me there are few villas nearby where drunk viet people like to sing karaoke almost every day up until midnight. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I understand they want to have fun. I understand they are drunk and don't care about other people.
 What I don't understand is why no one is doing anything about it? 20 drunk people affect thousands citizens who live nearby. Everyone is happy about noise? Can't believe it.
 Now the main part: there are four 5* star hotels near these villas. Classy, expensive, with good cars around it, etc et etc. Why management is doing nothing about drunkards in villas? It is so easy to call police. It is so easy to give them some money so they patrol this area a little more often. Submit complains, escalate problems to police superiors, even bribe if needed, etc etc. But why nothing? I live here for 6 months and problem doesn't go away. 
 I have so many questions.
 Hotel customers don't complain even when karaoke blasts at midnight? Hotel management doesnt care about anyone? Police doesnt care about 5* star hotels?
 Maybe vietnamese customers dont care about noise even if they rich because they are used to karaoke from their childhood. But what about foreign customers who live in 5* hotels? They don't complain too? I can hardly believe foreigners love this noise while they pay big sums of money for fancy hotel.
 Can some explain me this mystery?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Sooo, I am a 26yo art student, viet born in western europe and would love to explore some contemporary art spaces and the creative wave that’s been happening and just learn about the people and the culture.
 The thing is that I visited last summer, the first time in 15 years and was with family most of the time. This was a beautiful experience but also, I was super annoyed with how paranoid my family was about me doing stuff alone. I always needed someone of my family to be there with me or someone they knew to escort me around for the most simple things like getting a juice around the corner. 
 The main thing they’re scared off is me being sold, kidnapped or deceived and drugged, because I’m recognizable as a Viet Kieu and am female. Sometimes I get mistaken for being fully foreigner, like Thai or Indonesian, cause I don’t look like the typical Viet when it comes to my style or my accent, or whatever reason they say I don’t look like a typical viet. (fam also say I’m too ‘hiện’ lol)
 The thing is, I just want to explore places, meet likeminded creatives and enjoy my culture outside of the family. But is it true that I’m not safe doing things on my own? Can I really not take Grab’s without the chance of being kidnapped? Can I really trust no one?
 My family be saying crazy stuff like ‘dont go on dates cause if you reject him, he’ll drug you’ or ‘white people have it easier in VN than Viet Kieu’ 🤡
 Anyway, thoughts? I just wanna explore new spaces and hang out with new people but how my family puts it; I’m in danger as a female not viet-born person doing things on my own.

 Is it worth it?
 Generally I’m not a fan of those tourist trap kind of places, but the views from up there look incredible. It is also pretty damn expensive though.

Which she never took her, " she got better ". I haven't talked to the 1st cousin with the start up business over a year, but I do have her FB. The second cousin agreed she would pay me back this Tet when I visit VN. She usually call and ask how I'm doing and such but after the loan and I found out she didnt take her mom to the hospital , she kinda went MIA. I do have proof and receipt when I transfer the money. 
 Would it be rude of me if I just call them up out of nowhere to remind them that still owe me money? or should I just wait until I see them when I land and ask for it? 
 anybody has experiences of getting your money back from family members, let me know lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! My husband and I are visiting Vietnam this upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. We are planning a trip with my parents who live in Vietnam for 5 days during the 2 weeks before the holiday. My parents want to go from Quang Binh to Hoi An in 5 days. They want to visit Phong Nha Cave, Paradise Cave, Hoi An, Da Nang, and Hue. The plan is that we will land in Da Nang and travel with them immediately.
  
We will not use a tour agency so I am a little afraid of how many destinations they want to go to within such a small timeframe. Definitely, we will use public transportation to commute and that takes a lot of time to commute already. 
 The current itinerary: Quang Binh (1 day), Hue (1 day), Da Nang (1-2 day), and Hoi An (1 day)
 I hate jet lag and I want to take it slow to adjust to the local time when I first land. 
 We would like to enjoy the trip rather than move through each location super fast. We are considering tailoring in Hoi An for our wedding and it seems to not be doable with this iterary.
 I heard Hoi An is super crowded and 2 out of 5 days we plan to travel are weekends. 
 We love our parents but at the same time, we really want to visit Da Nang-Hoi An without rushing it.
  
Do you think this is a good idea? How can we commute between places if this trip is doable?
 I am gearing towards traveling to Ha Noi (3 days) and Halong Bay (cruise-2 days) so that we can experience the Northern vibe of the Tet holiday and enjoy more time on the trip.

 Preferably I am looking for full body massages or body scrubs. I’ve been to Vietnam already and been to the Miu Miu spa and liked the massage there but it was a female masseur and I didn’t feel so comfortable with that. I’ve also been to the Tarzan spa but that was more like a hidden brothel and the „massage“ was really bad. Definitely not looking for a happy ending thing. Looking for a proper massage!
 Price range should be around 500k. Would appreciate any serious tips maybe someone knows a good place.
 Thanks in advance!

 Anything is welcome and helpful!
 I do this for a report for my minor in International Development Management, I do know how to search for sources, but I have done this for other projects as well and Reddit always surprises me with very helpful sources and information🤗
 I you are someone or know someone who works with or in the Vietnamese avocado chain who is willing to partake in an interview also please let me know!

And in the past 6 months I have had 6 different accountants assigned to me. All of them are late in filing the paperwork, I have to constantly chase them, and they hardly reply to emails.
 So does anyone know where to find a good accountant that can help with accountancy and payroll? If not in this forum, somewhere else? I am relatively new in Vietnam and I am not sure where else to look. Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went to Vietnam in June for a few weeks with my wife and daughter. We went to Ho Chi Minh City, Que Nhon, and Dalat. We decided to buy insurance from Berkshire Hathaway Travel protection. We chose the coverage that only covered medical emergencies. The price was less than 100$. Mid way through our trip my daughter became very sick fever ect. She had a bacteria infection which landed her in the hospital for anti-biotics when over the counter did not do the trick. We stayed at Vinmec got receipts for everything and ended up staying in the hospital for 7 days. The cost for everything came out to around 3,000. Vinmec gave us all receipts in English and Vietnamese. I opened a case with Berkshire while on Vietnam and they said I had a year to send all docs. When we got home I sent all receipts and charges from my credit card they also asked for bank statements and after 25 days I received a check for the full amount. They covered the hospital stay, medicine, emergency room visit too. It was my first experience with Berkshire but will use them in the future. I recommended this to my friend that also went recently and she also has to take her daughter to the hospital it wasn't expensive but it sounds like it was covered her bill was only 300$

The past few weeks, I've had "people" add me saying that they knew me and claiming we have met before. I googled the picture of the first person from Việt Nam and the search came up with a Korean celebrity. The second person added me and sent me a message and I blocked them immediately. Is this something common on Zalo? My partner thinks the app has been compromised and that our info might be compromised as well. I was wondering if it was something common and that we are just beginning to experience it later than sooner. Should we just continue on blocking them? Has this happened to any of you using Zalo?

 Eventually I texted her the cafe address and was waiting. She said she’s lost and trying to find the cafe, I video called her several times but she declined. So I felt maybe it’s a prank and left the cafe.

 After exploring the country for a while, we would like to enjoy the beach and the sun before returning to -15°C and snow in Norway. After the beach we will go to HCM for NYE. 
 We have looked at Phu Quoc, but I am reading a lot about construction and trash here on Reddit. We don't have the budget to stay at a super fancy resort, but could pay to stay at the beach during the day. It seems like the island fits our preference in terms of weather, but I would love your opinion on the island in December in general. 
 Con Dao also seems interesting, if anyone has some input. 
 We are looking for: beach, sun, chilling (but also some activites). 
 I appreciate your help :)

 ​
 my girlfriend is vietnamese, she likes reading a lot but here in France she doesn't have access to a lot of books in vietnamese, so I was thinking to get her an ebook reader so she could download the books she wants directly to the ebook. Do you know where to get them?
 If you do, can you give me some links? And if you have recommendations of nice books to have that have been translated to vietnamese, or vietnamese books as well of course.
 ​
 Thanks : D

 I’m heading to HCMC for five days next week. When I was there last year, I was turned away from several money changers in the D1 area, namely a couple in Saigon Centre when I approached them with USD100 bills. They were more than happy to take my Singapore dollars though. Can’t quite remember what their explanations were (because I was getting quite frustrated and worked up then) so I thought I would check in here before I bring along USD on me again on this trip. Can I use Revolut/Youtrip in HCMC? 
 Thanks y’all!

My partner and I are currently in Nha Trang and I was about to buy some fruits from a market. I chose 2 apples and a kaki fruit, the owner said it cost 190k, which I think is a lot (same fruits would cost me only about 50k in my home country), so I offered 50k instead, which they refused after a bit of back and forth. My partner said to go, it's a scam but I feel bad/unsure. I know as tourists we usually get offered higher prices but I'm wondering if there is maybe something "special" about these fruits that make them expensive. What do you pay for these or would pay maximum for fruits like apples? Was this a scam or..? Thank you very much :)

 I am trying to learn Vietnamese to understand her and her culture, but I have checked the translation and still do not understand the meaning behind the joke. 
 I just smiled at her and told her I do not understand her joke. She was a little disappointed. 
 Can someone explain the joke to me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone else encounter extremely rude native Korean tourists? We’ve been going to Korean dense cities & I’ve noticed they’re very rude. And I know they’re Korean because I can hear them speak it.
 **I’m not saying it’s only native Koreans, but most of my interactions have been this way. I never experience this with Korean Americans back home, rich or middle class, so that’s why I’m so culture shocked by this behavior!
 Examples:
 Usually people move aside or try to avoid hitting the other person when walking opposite directions on a sidewalk.
  
I’ve been very harshly shoved by the shoulders or arms by Korean tourists who don’t even attempt to avoid me even when I try to avoid them. They’ll walk in a straight line, unwaivering, & will shove me hard then keep walking straight without looking back at who they hit. This has happened on multiple occasions where they can easily avoid hitting me as I try to avoid them.
  
Waiting
  
When waiting in line, I’ll just have a random Korean person shove their way in front of me as if I don’t exist. Same thing if I’m looking at something, but I’m standing to the side to allow others to walk by. 
 They’ll stand close & right in front of the displays, blocking me even though it’s clear I’m looking & trying to grab something.
  
Seats
  
At busy buffets, they’ll deny you sitting at the end of their empty table & far away by saying it’s full. Meanwhile, it’s empty the entire time we’re there. 
  
I haven’t experienced that with British, American, or Uzbek tourists at all. It’s literally just native Koreans. It’s driving me nuts! ESPECIALLY being hit & shoved! Teens don’t really do it, children I get, mid-20’s-60’s+ do it without care.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this has been asked a million times but the laws are constantly changing on this. What are the rules about names currently? I’ve heard that people used to do Vietnamese family name, English name, Vietnamese name. That way the child basically has two first names and can choose which one to use based on where they are. 
 Then I saw there was a new law that said they can only have an English family name. This makes no sense to me because no one in Vietnam would know how to pronounce my last name, and no one in America would call a child by their last name. 
 Are there other options? Can we register the baby’s name with the US first and then with Vietnam to force them to accept a different name?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Forgive me, I'm not even Asian, but this question popped into my head for some reason)
 Are aunties and mothers and grandmothers constantly trying to get their younger relatives married off? Or is this an outdated worldview? Would they try to get a younger woman with a much older unmarried man, if he was successful, even if the age difference was extreme, or do they mostly leave them alone?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently in Phu Quoc and have been staying around Grand World. Can someone explain what’s going on here? The food seems so sketchy with not that many people eating here. What I thought was a 7-11 was actually a 7-7. What I thought was a Baskin Robbin’s was just a random shop. The Lotteria…is this even real or just a fake too?
