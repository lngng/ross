 Edit: I had been looking at Kim Bespoke, Pham Custom Tailor and Nhut Tailor. 
 If you have any advice or info on these that would be great as well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asking here because I suppose some foreigners in this chat would know some good rental places. I'm a local from Saigon, looking to rent a quality bike for some road trip riding. Preferably something like the Exciter or Winner because I'll be riding into the mountains in Central highlands.
 Rental duration probably 3 weeks or so. But mainly, I'm hoping to find somewhere that can offer a bit of flexibility, because you never know what happens on a road trip. A plus point would be towing/recovery insurance just in case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 This summer my friend and I are traveling to Hanoi for three days. I have been doing a lot of research and scouring this subreddit looking for help with things to do. I know three days is not a lot of time but I am torn about whether a trip to Ha Long Bay is worth it. It looks absolutely stunning but I know it is a hike to get there from Old Quarter of Hanoi. Was wondering for people who have been to Hanoi -- is two days sufficient to see the main sights? or given our limited time the day trip to Ha Long isn't worth it? Would appreciate any insight from people who have been. Thank you and looking forward to my trip!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello I’m not really sure if this is right place to post and please let me know of there is somewhere better to post about this 
 Long story short I am Australian and my dad (54M) started dating a Vietnamese woman (37F) right before Covid. How they met I believe was through an ex of his who was also Vietnamese. My dad went overseas a few times in 2019/2020 to visit her before Covid hit and the obviously couldn’t travel again. Then in late 2022 he moved the woman and her kid here into the family home despite myself and brother having never met them 
 I am aware he was sending her money while she was overseas and since they have arrived in Australia money is a big source of argument. I believe he is still sending money to her family and that his wife still has a Vietnamese bank account and has asked for his password to his bank account. She has brought up multiple times to me that she had looked to live elsewhere in Australia or go back to Vietnam once the date is up that they meet their visa requirements 
 This all seems very concerning to me but I’m interested to hear from the Vietnamese community if this is normal or if she is just using my dad for a visa and is going to leave?
 *Forgot to add they legally got married in Australia in February 2023. Did the fake wedding in Vietnam in 2022 which was to appease family apparently. My brother and I weren’t invited or asked to attend but then randomly two days before got asked write a speech for this woman we had never never met…

 I want to get a electricity regulator but wife keeps saying not to. Main reason is she says electricity will be much more expensive. I ask her how much more but she isn't able to say.
 Does anyone know? So the reasoning is that let's say you use 1 million a month usually, with the regulator, it will make the electricity proper voltage so using more electricity even though your using the same.
 How much of an increase do you think that will be?

 At the start I looked over these things but it's starting to bother me more and more. i don't expect people to be like me and I don't expect Vietnam to behave like my home country. I'm not trying to change the Vietnamese people but trying to change the way I see things.
 This isn't a shit post or post to vent but more so a question of if it gets better or not.
 Im sure the bright eye bushy tail newbies will have something to say but I'm looking for advice from expats that have been here for 5 years or longer.

 Edit: So I waited untill 01:30 before waking him up. The guy was a heavy sleeper, I had to make so much noise. He got up, apologized and gave me my laundry back - it was right under the counter, I could have just grabbed it 😭

 I'm travelling to Vietnam later this year and wanted to take my medication with me. The issue is that it requires a prescription which I dont have since I got it over the counter from a different country (but it is prescription only in my current country and cant be bought in Vietnam). 
 The medication is not an addictive/abusive or psychedelic substance (so no opioids and not a adhd/anxienty/depression medication or whatever), and Im only planning to take what I need with me, so no massive quantities either.
 Would I end up having any troubles taking it to Vietnam? Im not so worried if it gets confiscated, just dont want to end up in prison or anything. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I have a remote job, I'm going to visit Vietnam to work and play (and visit family). I have to bring my work computer of course. But I hear the border agents may start asking you questions if you bring a lot of electronics. I was planning to bring my work computer, personal computer, Nintendo Switch and possibly my DSLR. What do you think of this? Some friends are telling me to leave the DLSR and personal computer at home and some suggest my iPad instead of my personal computer so I'm not traveling with two computers. Any advice on this? I just prefer my personal computer for ease of use, multiple tabs, search history and research. I know I can do it all on my phone and iPad too. Also, how dangerous is it to bring your DSLR when visiting tourists areas? I know many photographers do it but I don't want to lose anything on the trip or be a target for theft of course.
 ​
 Just any advice or personal opinions/experiences would be great.

 Luckily no major injuries, although I had to spend the whole morning getting checked and got some decent cuts on my feet (I guess sandals aren't the way to go).
 It was a hit an run and the police already found footage of the car that hit me. But it's all so avoidable if people just slow down. Also people on bikes need to learn how to use their signals because the car today just completely ignored mine. 
 Anyway, stay safe on the roads. I was as safe as I could've been and it still didn't matter. I guess that's the gamble you take every single day! 🎉

 I suffer from occasional panic attacks and sporadic moments of severe anxiety and I'm prescribed Alprazolam for this. 
 I have been travelling for a few months and my small supply has run out so I'm looking to buy a new box. 
 Has anyone got a good address where they don't sell the fake stuff? Could be another brand as long as it is legit and not some weird concoction. 
 Before I left my doctor gave me a paper explaining that I need to take this medicine, but I don't have a prescription for more at this present time. Does the paper (signed by the doctor) indicating that I am allowed to take this medicine as needed suffice to get it? 
 Also any idea on prices? 
 Thank you all for taking the time to answer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think it’s just so common as a Viet living abroad that random people shouting out Nihao or ching-chong all just straight up asking : Are you Chinese? Are you Korean? You look Chinese … etc. While in Vietnam, if we see a white person and we want to know where they’re from, we respectfully ask: Where are you from? We did not just straight up calling them French, Canadian or some nationality. We just referred to them as ”Tây” = Westerner; or “Người nước ngoài” = People from outer countries. If you’re back people will say you black. If you’re white people say you’re white. But when your EA or SEA or random Asian they say ‘Chinese’??? 
 Asia is so diverse, there are Laos, Mongolia, Malaysia, etc. :) Especially Vietnam has a painful history fighting back from China and suffers from cultures destruction and assimilation by Chinese, the feeling is worse. 
 I wish one day everyone can be more acknowledged of racial diversity in Asia and ask them more general question like : “Which part of Asian are you from? What’s your ethnicity?” Instead of labeling people with something that we are not sure of.

My family is hiding that news from her, and I don’t feel good about it. I mean I understand their intentions of not telling my grandma that she has cancer for her mental health, etc. But it feels extra wrong because they lied to her and said that her tumor was benign. I feel like it’s fair to share the news when the time is right, so she can maybe live life a bit differently. 
 Maybe I’m just Vietnamese-American and I just don’t understand the culture. Can someone give me more perspective and understanding to this difficult situation?

 I will be playing the usual global charts English music but I think it would also be good to infuse some popular Chinese or Vietnamese songs that the couple and their families might enjoy dancing to!
 Of course I tried looking at charts on Spotify etc but I think it would be more valuable to have suggestions from native people!
 Please recommend me some songs that I can play at the wedding party.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! Today I would like to discuss some tech and apps that can improve our daily routines. There are many apps and services that already make life easier in other countries. Some countries have completely automated and digitized everyday life. For example, there are apps that help with logistics such as scheduling appointments or managing deliveries; grocery delivery apps; payment apps that make transactions quicker and more secure. Doctor's appointments, accounting services, freelance work - the list goes on. And it is not necessarily something complicated and expensive, some services are convenient and popular, although behind them is a small development team.
 So, please share the apps and services that you're excited to try. Share your experiences and opinions, and feel free to elaborate on any particular features or benefits that you found most useful. Thank you for your input!
 Who knows, maybe it will come to life soon)

I was wondering if anyone else who is an expat currently lives in Ha Giang and could offer me some advice on how to find a place to live.
 I also have some concerns about moving to a smaller city, as I currently live in Hanoi. While I am drawn to the cooler climate and natural beauty of Ha Giang, I worry about the potential challenges of living in a smaller city with fewer amenities and opportunities.
 If anyone has made a similar transition from a larger city to a smaller one in Vietnam, I would love to hear about your experience and any advice you may have. How did you adjust to the change in pace and lifestyle? What were some unexpected challenges or benefits of living in a smaller city?
 Thank you in advance for your help and insights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Went inside to test ride a small training bike for my 5 year old. Going on the first test ride, I noticed that the tires were nearly flat deflated. Obviously my kid struggled to ride it well.
 On the return around, I asked why is the tire deflated? Can you inflate the tire so we can have a better test?
 Their smart answer was, "It comes from the factory like that. If you want us to inflate it, you'll have to buy it first."
 Completely ridiculous. Mind you we are still evaluating and testing the product, and you want us to make a buying decision while the product is unusable? After that conversation, I noticed the handle bar was completely loose. Figures as much why my son struggle to turn the bike. I put the bike back to find another bike. The 2nd bike I found also had a handle bar that was also completely loose from the front wheel. Someone assembling the product in their department needs to be evaluated.
 Why on earth do you setup a display of bikes that are unprepared for test ride for children? Why is your smart response are that the bikes "come from the factory like that" an appropriate answer for deflated tires? And why do you expect people to buy it from you while they can't even get normal working conditions to evaluate the quality of a product?
 I didnt expect this type of low end service behavior from buying at a department store, at a big mall no less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question is not just for vietjetair, it helps me if you have the same issue with any other form in Viet Nam. :)
 I am a foreigner in Vietnam, when I buy a flight on Vietnam Airlines I have no problems because the website is well developed, but when I buy it on vietjetair, the website does not allow more than 25 characters in the given name and last name fields. I have a very long European given and last name and it doesn't fit on the form.
 I always have to shorten it and that causes me a lot of problems at the airport because while passing control they stop me saying the name in the ticket is no the same name shown in the passport, I always waste time explaining to the staff that my name doesn't fit on the form when I buy the ticket through the Web. Many times I have to wait until manager comes and tell me is ok after check my passport and explain again the issue and once I almost miss flight because they made me wait too long.
 I have contacted the company and they do not give me any solution. Anyone with the same problem?
 Thank you.

 I'm having an incredibly difficult time finding things like nicotine patches, nasal sprays, lozenges, etc.
 All I can find is a product called Oh No from Long Chau pharmacy. 
 These small little bottles of lozenges really aren't doing the trick for me. They are expensive and the bottles run out very quickly. 
 Has anybody else had success with finding a decent product around here?
 Even smokeless tobacco seems impossible to find. 
 I'm feeling desperate. 
 Thanks for your time.

For instance, a recent video showing a policeman kicking a teenage boy while holding a gun has sparked a surprisingly positive response from some Vietnamese netizens.
 In the video, the policeman can be seen kicking the teen who is already sitting on the ground with a gun pointed at him. However, instead of outrage, some netizens have applauded the officer's actions, with comments such as "Very good beating," "Always support the police," and "I fully support the police officers like this."

 Question is:
 - How to get there if I'm not going to use a rented motorcycle?
 - Is it safe to just go there using a rented motorcycle?
 - Should I book from taxi mobile application? 
 - Is commute an easy way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning to arrive in HCMC tomorrow for 2 weeks with additional week in Da Nang. Seek your quick advice:
  
SIM Card?: I have been suggested its better to not buy at the airport. Plan is to get a Grab to my hotel, check in, and then find some shop for SIM Card. However, can you recommend which SIM Card/company is better? (Just want reliable internet/data)
 
Where to exchange currency?: While airport is a no go (will exchange just enough for taxi and check in), curious if there're any specific places with great exchange rates? (Eg. SuperRich in Bangkok is known for its highly competitive exchange rate). 
 
 Or Is it feasible to withdraw money from the ATM? (Again, eg. in Bangkok, you are charged 220 THB right away for every ATM withdrawal so unless you're withdrawing chunk of cash, its just dropping money on avoidable)
  
Worth it to drive moped/bike to get around? For reference, I have driven in South Asia so I am quite used to...uh, interesting drivers.

 Ive read about motes, not sure i can use it/make one that isnt too high. My cats are small still so they may not reach or knock it over trying to get high enough.
 I figured maybe someone in VN has the same problem and found a good way to stop, or bought something?

 ​
 So some background information. I'm an American who got a B.S. Electrical Engineering degree back in 2016. After school I ended up hating electrical engineering and took a job working in media out of college, but I hated that too. Then in early 2020 I switched careers to IT and got a bunch of basic IT certifications. I have been working as IT support for the last 3 years. I am by no means an IT expert, but I at least have some idea of what I'm doing. I also enjoy the work that I do and enjoy learning new skills, which in the IT industry, there seems to be a never ending…]]></summary>

 I set my phone as lost on ‘Find My iPhone’ with the following message Chiếc iphone này bị bỏ lại sau khi nhặt, vui lòng gọi (dads phone number here) để trả lại càng sớm càng tốt hoặc chuyển đến Fusion Suites Sài Gòn or WhatsApp (my phone number here, as I have WhatsApp on this phone instead of my personal)
 The best part is that as soon as I did that the driver did actually call my dad but unfortunately due to language constraints between the two they weren’t able to communicate effectively. 
 What’s frustrating though is that since then I have tried to call my phone multiple times and the driver has refused to pick up. 
 I have tried reaching out to grab via their helpline but the phone line keeps getting disconnected. I am also unable to sign into my grab account on this second phone as I need Facebook 2FA and the code generator is on my personal phone. 
 Just looking for advice, support, next steps or others who have faced something similar I guess. 
 I’m worried that the phone will eventually die and I will no longer be able to track it and then all hope is lost lol.

 Already there is a language barrier they speak very little English and when I try to use a translator it seems to upset them and they try to communicate with me in small phrases but obviously I lose meaning of what they try to say and they lose meaning of what I try to say.
 So far he has gotten mad at me twice, one for walking upstairs wit my shoes on and another by attempting to contact his wife without going through him.
 At this point I think I’m just culturally missing some elements that he is starting to take as disrespect, I have to talk to them again at their house in a few days and I’m not trying to get cursed out again in Vietnamese pls help.

 I'll be moving to Saigon soon (district 1) and I was wondering if you can recommend stores in the area where I could buy some home essentials like small electronic appliances, kitchen utensils, bedsheets, towels, etc.
 Also, are there any supermarkets in district 1 where I could find Western products and ingredients? I have a senstitive stomach, so I might need some type to adapt..
 Thank you in advance!

 How do you respond in Vietnamese when you get compliments appearance wise?
 I'm half Chinese and half Vietnamese living in Europe. In China you don't really say thank you. You just downplay it or deny it playfully.
 I grew up ugly so I never had this encounter but now as an adult I have gotten couple compliments. I just don't know how to answer other than giggling and shaking my head. Thank you for the help. ❤️

 I am visiting HCMC in early June, partially as a vacation but partially to learn more about the local scene for entrepreneurs and freelancers. I currently run a small business in China providing college advising and related educational services (e.g. extracurricular training in debate, economics/business, and writing). There have been some successes but I need a break from China and I'm strongly considering to run the business remotely for a time while exploring nearby countries, partially for my own enjoyment but potentially towards moving or expanding the business in the longer term.
 As far as networking in HCMC, I saw a once-a-month networking event on meetup.com and something about IT or tech entrepreneurs on Thursdays, not to mention American Chamber of Commerce events. Beyond that I'm not sure exactly where to start and figured I might as well just put myself out there.
 Does anyone have any advice on how to meet entrepreneurs in the educational field, both Vietnamese locals and expats? Anyone here running their own small business or online business in Vietnam and would like to meet for a coffee or beer?
 Thanks for reading!

 I am currently travelling around Vietnam with my girlfriend and we are in Ninh Binh where it is raining today tomorrow with some thunderstorms(apparently) and I am just wondering what are common indoor activities or that when it is raining so much?
 Is it similar to other countries like bowling/cinema in bigger cities or is there some more localised activities?
 If anyone has any suggestions for Ninh Binh I'd be very thankful but it just made me think about everywhere else around the country too.

 I have almost 2 years internship experience with multinational corporations on top of my degree. I’m mostly interested in positions involving cloud, DevOps, networking and operating systems, rather than full time software development. 
 How easy would it be for a non Vietnamese graduate to find an entry level position? What would a reasonable monthly wage be? I’ve seen positions ranging from $900-2500, and was wondering what an acceptable range for negotiation would be. Lastly, are there any specific websites I can look for jobs? I’ve currently just been using LinkedIn, Glassdoor and indeed.

Is that a possible thing to do or do I need a lot of luck?
 Option b would be to arrive early in HCM airport and stay there over night, though not sure if thats recommended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was on Ta Hien street last night and was planning to just walk (ten minutes) to the hotel but the obnoxious cab drivers would not stop pestering me so I just took a taxi. I told the driver my hotel name and he started driving and then takes me to like four different hotels and each time I say this is not my hotel.
 Finally he asks to use my phone for google maps and I hate handing my phone over but was tired and starting to feel sick. I rolled down the window for air and then he rolled it back up. Finally I couldn't hold it and start puking out the window because this 2 minute trip has become a 20 minute oddysey.
 He then tells me this is my hotel (which it isn't) and demands like $500 for me throwing up when I didn't even want this cab in the first place. I gave him like $100 which is all I had then got out and he sped off with my phone ignoring me flagging him down.
 POLICE are zero help because I don't remember the drivers cab number. Is there ANYTHING I can do? My phone is not showing on the findmyiphone app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I often get these friend requests from attractive looking Vietnamese female profiles on Facebook. Sometimes they are from Vietnam and sometimes they are in the US. They would chat with me and reveal their scam by trying to get me to sell random stuffs for them on some scam sites that give them commissions. I think they themselves believe that those scam sale sites are legit. 
 Another scam is they say they trade options to make money on the side and can help me make money, I never let it go further than that so I don’t know exactly how they do it. However, 90% of them would just chat and talk to me for weeks and months. I entertain them and keep talking to them to see what the scam is but it never comes. I talk to them like a normal respectful person but never show them that I am thirsty. Eventually they just stop talking to me. 
 The one thing in common I noticed is that they would edit old photo posts from months and years ago. Why do this? Is it their way of establishing that the profile is legit because they have posts from years ago? Is there ever a legit reason for someone to edit photos from a couple years ago? I am just trying to understand what is it they want from me or what kind of scam it is because it is a lot of time and efforts they go through. Thank you guys.

 I am always very careful when inputting the pickup address and drop a pin exactly where I am on the map. But when I go to find them I am walking up and down the street and can't see them.
 I have a 4G sim. Am I doing something wrong or is the app location a bit off sometimes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hoping this is the right place to ask - I'm looking for a European based Vietnamese teacher to help me improve my Vietnamese. I lived in Hanoi for a couple of years where my learning was very minimal and since moving back to Europe, I would like to improve my level. 
 I take online lessons but the time zones make it a bit difficult with a teacher based in Vietnam, so it limits my lessons to an hour a week.
 If anyone here knows anyone that would be able to help me, or point me in the right direction, that'd be perfect. They don't need to be a qualified teacher, just someone who I could practice with, and is able to explain about the grammar/pronunciations aspects.
 Thanks in advance!

 Did I create a false memory in my head or something? It's driving me crazy!
 I've been in Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An and Da Lat if that helps. Is it a regional thing?

 I suppose I've been doing slightly less excercisey things (i.e no lifting weights) but we still walk probably a couple miles a day. Plus, I feel like I can go into bottomless pit mode at home when I'm just being a couch potato. 
 Anyone else experience this? For the record, I eat a relatively healthy diet back in the states so I dont think it's due to me consuming less processed foods.

Other than basketball, what other team sports is common? What about individual sports? We’re moving there soon and trying to see what will be available for my boys. They’re currently in baseball, soccer/football, and folkstyle wrestling. Doesn’t look like they’ll have access to wrestling from my limited research. What about baseball? Thanks for any info/suggestions!

 I'm coming to Vietnam soon and I was hoping to do a three-day long Halong bay cruise at the end of April. I've been browsing various websites, but it seems that most of them charge quite hefty for a single person ($600+). Is that price normal? Is there a way to find more affordable Halong bay cruise?

I guess the only plus is that it made me realize how much I absolutely love Dalat, Hôi An, and Phong Nha.

While looking for the best places to stay during raining season I came across Cat Ba Island. Beautiful area, less touristy then Halong Bay while still having plenty of restaurant options and other things to do. 
 However, when looking at the weather forecast for august it says there could be monsoons and very heavy rain. Is this still doable or would it be cloudy and raining for most of the day? 
 Other suggestions are also really appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always used this term in order to refer to the Vietnamese fighters from the second world War, I'm actually a big fan of Vietnam because they were brave enough to defeat world power countries in many wars protecting the territory against the invasors, however I was talking to my teacher who is a history scholar and he said that this term is racist. 
 I was confused because I always considered it a sort of Pride specially because here in south America as the history of Vietnam has always been a inspiration for us. 
 I'm also quite embarrassed, I have a friend from Vietnam and I've been using this term for a while, well this friend never said anything against it, this is what makes me even more confused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering Lasik eye surgery in Saigon. The last post here re Lasik was a few years ago and I'm wondering if anyone here has had the procedure done more recently than that? Cao Thang Eye Hospital looks good.
 Hoping to get recommendations for hospital and costs as well as actual recovery time and follow up appointments.
 As a solo traveller is the recovery something that you can get through on your own? Is it as simple as having a hotel to stay at for the following night and arranging a lift from the hospital back to the hotel?
 What about follow up appointments, I'm not overly keen on staying in HCMC for too long. How about heading to Danang the following day and checking back in at HCMC on the way back to flying out? Were you able to swim and ride a motorbike after the procedure? I think swimming is not recommended. Just wondering what to do in recovery I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have a question about buying a DJI mini 3 pro with the RC and Fly more kit plus in Vietnam. I'll be visiting the country in about a month and I'm wondering how much it would cost to buy this product in a local store. Unfortunately, I cannot order it from the official DJI site because I'll be moving around a lot.
 Can anyone recommend the best stores to go to for purchasing this drone in Vietnam? Also, I'm a bit concerned about the legality of flying drones in Vietnam. What happens if the police catch you with a drone? Is it illegal to fly drones in certain areas of the country?
 Thank you for your help and advice in advance. I'm really looking forward to my trip to Vietnam and I'd love to capture some amazing footage with my new drone.

My research told me it was going to be absolutely packed full and we have just driven around and seen hardly anyone. Any explanations?

        <updated>2023-04-10T00:24:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 My fiancée and I are planning to take a trip out to Nha Ttrang in September/October. My company does not give me much vacation time - only 3 weeks a year - so for this trip, I am only looking to spend about 7-ish days in VietNam, with a few of them specifically in Nha Trang.
 I make a fairly good income at my job - just shy over $100K USD - and I'm not reluctant to spend $130-$180 a night at a nice hotel with my fiancée. Unfortunately we are in the process of waiting for a Visa, so do not see one another that frequently. My fiancée doesn't care too much about fancy accommodations since she grew up fairly frugal, but I don't mind spending the extra $$ because I'm a little spoiled.
 Anyways, what is everyone's favourite luxury hotel in Nha Trang? We we will be taking a flight from HCM. The 40-50min drive from the airport isn't a deal breaker, so the hotel does not necessarily need to be in a convenient in-between location from airport and the night market.
 We've looked up a few spots already; Queen Ann, Ariyana SmartCondotel, and Panorama by HLG.
 The biggest thing I'm looking for is a comfortably-sized shower for additional intimacy.

 Australia getting pretty grim with high interest rates and corporate owned houses for renting, rich boomer generation buying multiple houses to rent out and rich overseas investors buying 5+ houses to rent out. A lot more homeless around nowadays. 
 But our salaries are alright, even a waiter can afford a house if we save good for 3-5 years, we could probably get a mortgage that will take a life time to pay off.
 I went over to vietnam and found out that salaries can be 250k to 500k VND, depending on location. But the property prices are equivalent to USA and Aus. 
 Not everyone will have corporate jobs or be in a financial situation to afford these prices.
 How is it looking for those who are starting from scratch? No family to assist, just a normal everyday job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 After searching the subreddit, I've seen several questions about short layovers in HCMC (5-6 hours max). Most of the consensus I've read is that Tan Son Nhat makes that short of a stopover risky, and best to stay in the airport. However, in June I'll be flying in on my way back to Australia and I'll have 10 hours of stopover time from landing to the next departure.
 I already went ahead and got a visa, so that should speed things up. If I factor in 30 min to 1 hour for customs, another 30 minutes or so into the city centre via taxi, and then 30 min to get back to the airport 3 whole hours before my international departure, that still leaves me with potentially 5 hours in HCMC. Worth it in my book! I never thought I'd get to set foot in Vietnam so I'm excited to take the opportunity.
 Where's the best area to wander for 5-ish hours in HCMC? Try some local Vietnamese dishes, get a bit of a sense of what the city is like, any quick interesting sights, etc. I'll be there on a Friday if that makes a difference for any markets or things that will be open.
 Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was the 3rd Mongol invasion of Vietnam, along the Bạch Đằng river. The Viets positioned themselves in small flotilla along the river, and made a false retreat drawing the Mongol fleet into the trap.With the Yuan fleet trapped, the Vietnamese junks armed with bombs, attacked them from all sides. Many of the Mongols jumped into the river to save themselves were killed or drowned. The Viet captured around 400 Yuan warships.
 This victory effectively put an end to the Mongol invasions of Vietnam, though the Viet monarch Trần Nhân Tông, decided to accept the supremacy of Kublai Khan to avoid further conflicts.The failure of the Mongol invasions was however a shattering blow for their supremacy in Asia, and Vietnam's success gave more confidence to the other Asian nations to halt the once invincible Mongol juggernaut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, a couple of days ago, there was an article in vn express about how slow the immigration and baggage claim process is at the 2 big airports. I experienced that when I landed in Hanoi in late October 2022. The arrival hall was totally packed. About an hour until I got through.
 I’m wondering if anyone has experience arriving in Da Nang instead. I looked around online and there isn’t much in the way of comments about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Base on a article on “Tuoitre” According to the explanation of the Chairman of Hoi An City Nguyen Van Son, the revenue from entrance tickets serves the conservation, embellishment and restoration of monuments, renovating the infrastructure in the old quarter, and organizing events. tourism events, as well as supporting people in home renovation and renovation, etc. At the same time, it is compulsory to buy tickets for all visitors when visiting Hoi An ancient town to ensure fairness for the locality and visitors. 
 Ticket prices are issued at 120,000 VND/ticket for international visitors and 80,000 VND/ticket for domestic visitors. Such a two-price policy that distinguishes between domestic and foreign people, dating back several decades, is completely out of line with international practices. 
 There are two types of spaces that need to be clearly defined, where the proposed toll is public space or owned space (eg museums, monuments...). If the space is owned, the owner has the right to collect a fee. On the contrary, if it is a public space, it belongs to the whole people, belongs to everyone, and has no right to collect fees. 
 Hoi An sells entrance tickets, in the case of legality, on the one hand, it brings the city's budget but on the other hand increases the cost of tourists.
 I strongly think this is a step back for Hoi An tourism some Comment I ever read even said don’t turn “Hội An” to “Hội Ăn”

 Please recommend me some Vietnamese songs!! I must say that I am not a fan of the Vietnamese music genre(???). You know! Long, drawn-out words with vibrato, sung along with some sort of stringed instrument (sorry mom!!!). 
 I want songs with Vietnamese lyrics, but in another style. Rock & Pop-Rock are my preferred genres. Fast, upbeat! And I don't care what the lyrics say as long as they are in Vietnamese. 
 Artists/Projects I like: Kagerou Project, Weezer, Wallows, Sex Bob-Omb 
 Please do recommend me something!!! Thank you :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d like to share an experience. I had a deep communication with a Chinese in recent days. At that time we discuss some really sensitive political topics between Vietnam and China. However, both of us were not angry but showed the mutual respect. That’s unexpected for me. 
 We talk about the China's actions during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war and the conflict in South China Sea (he called ). I think these thing were enough to cause Vietnamese angry. But he disagreed.I found that you really can't expect a Chinese person to admit to the fault of his government (though thankfully, he was still thinking about what I said)
 When I talked to him about Taiwan, he would only say that since Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century, this is the reason why it is now part of the PRC. I told him that many Taiwanese do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and that many of my Vietnamese friends either believe that the first country to fully rule Taiwan was Imperial Japan or that it is a legitimate territory of the ROC, and these views are both based on solid facts. I could see that he didn't know much about these things. But he still was considering about what I was saying, even though he didn’t quite agree.
 Actually, we disagreed with each other all the time. But the impression is not bad, maybe both of us were very polite. If all Chinese are like him, I think the communication between our countries will be better.

 I recently moved to Hanoi, Vietnam, to start a new chapter here. I love this place so much but I find myself often confused on how many options I have for grocery shopping, and it got me thinking about where could I find the best prices of groceries in spite of being a foreigner. I have got some names of some supermarkets but I was wondering If I could go even cheaper to buy groceries. If anyone here has any idea I would really appreciate it and hopefully others coming to Vietnam can benefit from this post if someone drops any value here.
 Thank you and have a nice day

 Being from the UK, I can’t say I’ve had much actual experience with what Falun Gong is beyond the whole China situation, which as you can imagine often attracts a lot of negativity and general bad feeling. 
 I’m wondering how Falun Gong is actually viewed by Vietnamese people. I’m guessing given the amount of times I’ve come across practitioners, it’s viewed more favourably than it is in the UK or other places.

 I can't find it on any Vietnamese websites, so my question is, what are the best international websites to buy and ship to Vietnam. 
 My current plan is to order it to my home in the UK, and have someone ship it to me here, surely there is a better option.

Her family apparently follows Cao Dai. She herself says she has no religion, though she is quite interested in Buddhist philosophy and often reads Buddhist-flavored self-help books (like Thich Nhat Hanh and Haemin Sunim).
 Anyway, she's incredibly kind, fun-loving, philosophical, selfless, and more. I'm just wondering whether coming from a family that follows Cao Dai is like the Vietnamese equivalent of a Mormon family, a Scientology family, or really just no big deal? Is there anything I should be aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m planning a trip this October to Vietnam with my boyfriend for our birthdays for about 2.5 weeks. His birthday is the 18th and mine the 24th! For additional context, He is a city guy and I’m more of a nature and landscape gal. We both like water. So based on that I was curious which itinerary anyone would anyone recommend in mid October taking into account the central region rainy season. We also want to ensure we have the most sun/best warm weather in the islands.
 I’m not sure on the amount of days yet in each place so any recommendations are welcome :) also are there any “must see” places I am missing that would fit into the below with the amount of time we have? Thank you!! 
 Itinerary 1 Land in Hanoi-> Sapa-> Halong Bay -> hoian? (Not sure if I should avoid due to rain) Fly to Ho Chi Minh -> Phu Quoc islands then back to Ho Chi Minh to fly home 
 Itinerary 2 Land in Hochiminh -> Phu Quoc islands -> back to Ho Chi Minh-> fly to Hanoi -> Sapa -> Halong bay -Hanoi and any day trips from there then fly home from Hanoi

 Next question, I understand that tab water in Hanoi is not clean enough to drink and that there was even an scandal in 2019. Since I drink a lot of water, try to avoid plastic bottles and will stay around four years, I'm considering buying a more heavy duty purifier, such as the Bluewater Spirit. https://www.bluewatergroup.com/product/bluewater-spirit/
 Does anyone have experience using such products in Hanoi/Vietnam? Or are there better local options? Thanks!

I'd preferably want there to be two capitals, the western capital and the eastern capital, The western capital could be either Sylhet or Chittagong (Chattogram) and the eastern capital could be either Bangkok or Hanoi. I personally think that it would be great. I mean, look at India, it has different cultures and languages/language-families (Indo-European, Dravidian etc.).. I want these countries that I mentioned to be one country for the greater good (of humanity). Even if they were to merge, they would not be as big in size as China, India or the USA but they would be bigger in size than as they are presently.These countries that I mentioned are all connected by land, not just the water (for some more context, for those reading and looking to get it). If anyone else on here who sees this also wants this to happen, please feel free to give some suggestions and let's gather some ideas on seeing if this could actually go forth.
 P.S.: I haven't thought of a name for the proposed country yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all I want to say after spending 2 of my 3 weeks in Vietnam so far it's been great. I have spent time all over the country and have been to Ho Chi Minh, Da Lat, Nha Trang, Da Nang and Hoi An. Every city have had its unique feeling and I have loved it so far.
 Now I'm finally in Ha Long, this was supposed to be the real tropical paradise stop with beaches and swimming. Boating through the unique Islands in the bay and just relax before going to Hanoi for the flight back home. 
 I decided to go on a bot trip while in Ha Long and just enjoy the almost mystical atmosphere you get boating through the bay between hundreds of small rocky islands.But this absolutely broke my heart, instead of a mystical and paradise like environment we got nothing but waters absolutely full of trash. 
 It didn't matter where you looked, it was just full of mostly styrofoam blocks and other plastic waste, but also some random wood and other garbage also floating around. And I'm not surprised that the waters are so littered, there where hundreds of tourist boats in the bay at any given time. Unfortunately this seem to partly be because of over tourism in the bay, and going through Ha Long city there seem to be alot of relatively new developments but 70% of it looked to be empty or abandoned. 
 I am just a tourist that get to see this city for a limited time, can anyone from the area tell me more about how you perceive the city's and they bays development over the past few years. And if you have toured Ha Long just as me and have similar or very contrasting experiences, please share. 
 Love from Sweden 🇸🇪

 does anyone know, if it is possible to expand the permission to stay in vietnam? We got our visa to late and now we are in vietnam with the 15-day permit, that we can get with a german passport. Now we have got our 30 day visa, but the stamp in the passport says, that we have to leave Vietnam at the 12th April. We want to leave it at the 24th. Then we stayed here 28 days in total. Is it now possible, to expand the permission to stay with our visum without traviling outside of vietnam? Maybe at the immigration office in Hanoi? Has everyone tried that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am *thinking* about taking an extended backpacing trip through Vietnam. I have never backpacked before so tbh I’m not even sure what that means. I am looking for any and all advice as I formulate my plan of travel. 
 Budgeting; if I am trying to keep it mid to low cost how much can I expect to pay per day? I found some posts that said 50$ a day would be sufficient if I stay in hostels, hitchhike, and take the bus places. (That was including lodging). Does this hold true?
 Things to do: as I have no idea what Vietnam is like i plan to soak up as much as possible. I’m told any and all caves are worth a visit. Is there anyone out there who has been to Vietnam before and is willing to share or send me their itinerary? I can taylor it to my needs but i would be forever greatful to you kind stranger. 
 If I want to travel to a different country after Vietnam has anyone had experience applying for a multi trip visa? (Google can probably answer that one for me but there’s nothing better than first hand knowledge).
 Any and all wisdom is greatly appreciated. I plan to Only bring a 40-50L backpack too. Is this feesable.? Experienced backpackers, any pointers on what I should pack and how many of each item? I tend to over pack so I would probably do 2 weeks worth of clothes if I can fit it in the backpack but if someone is able to get away with less then i‘d happily pack lighter.

He honked and honked. While trying to pass us, the other car hit our side mirror. I could look into the other car and saw a young man in a military uniform looking very angry at us, like we were the inconvenience to him. After he passed by, I could see a red colored license plate. If I am not mistaken, that plate belongs to the military and is ranked the highest among other plates. After complaining to other people that an officer does not adhere to the law, they told me that those people ARE the law. Even normal police officers couldn’t do anything about it.

 Some details about us: I am a foreigner and she is Vietnamese. We have been together for 7 years. We went broke together and came out of it doing well now. We have been through sickness (somewhat) and are in health. We use to fight about trivial matters and misunderstandings due to the language barrier but we learned to communicate better and rarely ever fight nowadays. We also have a daughter together and we are about to achieve our dream of owning our own house very soon. 
 Can you recommend me any Vietnamese love songs with lyrics or meaning similar to Bon Jovi's "Thank you for loving me"? 
 Really appreciate it!

 I'm a student from VN currently living in the U.S. and my VN passport is nearing expiration so I have to renew it via mail. I looked at the embassy website and they said to submit a processing fee but didn't specify how much.

 Long story short, the hotel where I am going to stay in Hanoi in November gave me some good deals for a 2-day/1-night cruise on one of the ships mentioned in the title. The problem is that I can't seem to figure out which one to choose...
 Le Theatre has a great dinner place with a piano and good outdoor areas on top, but I have seen comments about degradation problems and it not being very clean.
 Scarlet Pearl seems to be very new and clean, but it may have fewer outdoor areas...
 As for the itinerary, I think both are equivalent.
 Which one do you guys think I should choose?
 Thanks! 😁

 https://vietnamnet.vn/en/from-may-15-all-visitors-to-hoi-an-must-buy-entrance-tickets-2128394.html
 ​
 I know they just announced this but how would I pay for the fee to enter the town if I'm coming from the Da Nang airport around 9 p.m. and not entering the town until close to 10 p.m. if the ticket booths to enter the town close at 9:30 p.m.? How would I get to my hotel? Does my driver need to find a different route where I pay? Would the hotel help me?

Tôi không tiện kể ở đây nhiều nhưng có một chuyện làm tôi nhớ mãi. Hồi nhỏ tôi rất thích xem các videos về DIY và thường rất táy máy làm theo, và thế là tôi lôi chiếc quần CŨ của mình ra để cắt tái chế thành một cái quần mới cho giống trên mạng, chuyện sẽ không có gì khi mẹ tôi phát hiện ra tôi cắt quần của mình và đi rêu rao với tất cả họ hàng là tôi rất rất hư, tôi học theo mấy con Đ.Ĩ trên mạng để trở thành những người như vậy (tôi thậm chí còn không mang cái quần đó ra đường). Và từ đó trở đi + nhiều chuyện nữa, tôi luôn có một nỗi lo với những người lớn tuổi hơn, tôi luôn ám ảnh việc người khác nghĩ gì về bản thân, tôi sợ người khác hiểu nhầm mình. Tôi luôn luôn mang trong mình một nỗi lo là tôi không giỏi, tôi không bao giờ được người khác công nhận, tôi không bao giờ được ai lắng nghe…

When we go out to eat, should I order my own food or just let him order and ask for extra plates?
 I have several mental health issues and my child is autistic. I am high functioning, receive mental health services, work full time and have full custody of my kids. I know it’s not appropriate to discuss emotions in many Asian cultures but I feel like it’d be the right thing to do to bring it up eventually. How should I do this? Should I be prepared for him to see me as weak and leave?
 What’s the best way to show him I care? My love language is touch but I wouldn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable in public. Would it be acceptable make a dessert for him? 
 What else do I need to know?
  
Thank you!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to share this because there is almost zero criticism of this place anywhere I could find on the internet.
 We have spent two days here and have decided to abandoned ship and move on with the rest of the country. The main reason is that there is not much to do, and nowhere worth going to eat. 
 It obviously depends on what you like, but if it includes meat, you wont be getting that. Almost all meat here is not what it is advertised as, and will likely destroy your stomach the next day. We spent hours researching restaurants to eat at and compared to the rest of Vietnam, they are really quite pathetic. 4.7-5 star reviews on many restaurant are just an absolute joke. 
 Da Lat is a picturesque city with a nice climate this time of year. The hotels are all a bit tired and run down but that is to be expected considering the location. There are some nice bars hidden away for people to discover and you can do some small touristy activities like Crazy House, Coaster, Bike trips but that's about it. 
 It is interesting that there are not many honest reviews containing criticism of any places in this country.

 She wants to use these to fill so she can take some liquids on the plane. In Europe these small plastic bottles are sold at pharmacy and convenience stores but she is struggling to find them in Vietnam. 
 She will be in Hanoi so any specific store she could find it from there or any chain of a common store she could find such bottles at would be very helpful!

 What are cheap hospitals or clinics in HCMC that can do cheap blood tests and visits to the doctor? I want to avoid expat prices. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been living here for over a year now and I'm curious to know what are some recommended insurance plans that other Americans use that won't break the bank. When I first came here I had world nomads, but they turned out to be no good after I was hospitalised and didn't plan on returning home anytime back to the states. They said that exempt me from getting my claim. Then I had Safetywing but they are more of a (you pay now and file a claim and we will send you the money later) kind of deal. I'm living in HCMC and am just looking for a good insurance plan I can rely on if I do get injured and I can just go to the hospital (Probably Vinmec) and just get helped on the spot no questions asked. Can anyone give me any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm Vietnamese and I've eaten Nem Chua all my life and I've recently realized that Lao and Thai people have a very similar raw fermented Sausage that is called Naem. Is this a cognate where the word (possibly origin?) comes from the same source or is a coincidence? Vietnamese considers a lot of "sausage meat" related food "Nem" like in Nem Nuong and Nem Ran and I'm not sure if Thai and Lao people consider other meat Nem/Naem like in Vietnamese. I've done some research and fermented sausage eaten raw is unique to South East Asia so it would make sense if they come from a similar origin somewhere in South East Asia as opposed to the cooked Lap Xuong that comes from China.

I know DEET is probably the most effective but it's so harsh it can eat through synthetic fibers if you're not careful. Has anyone tried Picaridin in Vietnam and does it work? I hear Picaridin doesn't hurt synthetic fibers, is not oily and doesn't smell. Or maybe a mixture of both DEET on your skin and Picaridin sprayed on your clothes?

 ​
 In May, I have a flight that will have a 6 hour layover in Ho Chi Minh airport.
 ​
 I was wondering if anybody could tell me if this would be enough time to at least visit the city center or some interesting areas nearby the airport or if this is not enough.
 ​
 I'm traveling on a Mexican Passport so I would need to process an E-Visa which is 25 USD, which is not a problem at all but if it's not even enough time to visit the outsides I would rather just transit in the airport.
 ​
 Thank you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm writing a Pokemon story where one of the regions is inspired by modern-day Vietnam, and I was wondering what elements of Vietnam would work well in Pokemon. This includes towns, cities, gyms, and The Elite Four. I came here because people on this subreddit know more about Vietnam than me. I take inspiration from other cultures in my writing so I can learn more about said cultures, and I don't wanna accidentally offend anyone. If anyone has suggestions on what elements of Vietnam would work well in my Pokemon story, please comment them down below!
 Here are the gyms and elite four:
 Gyms:
 Gym 1: Poison
 Gym 2: Psychic
 Gym 3: Electric
 Gym 4: Ground
 Gym 5: Normal
 Gym 6: Rock
 Gym 7: Dragon
 Gym 8: Steel
 ​
 Elite Four:
 Elite 1: Dark
 Elite 2: Grass
 Elite 3: Fighting
 Elite 4: Fairy
 Champion: Ice

 As the title says, what's something that might get my Hanoi friend to laugh and be confused by how I know that?
 It's Monday there when I post this, so are there any good local memes?
  
Last year I started learning Russian for my friends in Kyrgyzstan. Now I'm also learning Vietnamese so I'll be good when I visit.

 Me and my girlfriend are planning to visit your beautiful country this September. Probably from end of August till mid-September.
 However, I have found out that during this time Vietnam experiences relatively a lot of rain in some parts of the country. 
 We planned to visit Hanoi, Sapa, Ha long Bay, Ninh Binh, Hoi an, Hue and Phu quoc. Now I have read mixed information in the internet, so I thought I would ask maybe a local or someone who already visited Vietnam during this time period. Is end of August till mid-September a good time to visit these locations or which should I eventually skip?

 Ban đầu em có dự tính thi vào thiết kế đồ họa (em thích ngành này từ năm lớp 9) nhưng mà nghĩ lại và nghe mọi người khuyện nhủ thì em lại đang khá phân vân, liệu mình chọn ngành này sau này thu nhập có ổn định không, có đủ để gửi tiền hàng tháng về cho bố mẹ được không...có lẽ em thích là một chuyện nhưng nếu sau này ra trường lương lại ít hơn số tiền bỏ ra thì em thấy có lỗi với bố mẹ lắm ạ..
 Em đang phân vân giữa kiến trúc, ,thiết kế đồ họa, thiết kế nội thất. Ba ngành này em học ngành nào cũng được và sẽ quyết tâm đến cùng ( em có thế mạnh về vẽ và Toán Lý, biết sử dụng pts)
 Mọi người tư vẫn cho em với ạ

 Next up Danang if you have recommendations for bars and clubs? Unfortunately We're there during the week, Tuesday to Thursday.

I can be wholesome and also party(although i have slowed down in my late 20s) I’ve traveled from the south up north 3 years ago so I’m familiar with the landscape. Did the whole backpacking thing already. My interest includes art, tattooing, fishing, motorcycles, tech, music, traveling. I’m pretty open minded just looking for some new friends(usually more extroverted) but just been with family. If you’re chill respectful and have decent morals I’m free to meet up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! This summer, I'll move to Hanoi (from Rome) for a four-year diplomatic posting. I'm super excited to explore Hanoi and the rest of Vietnam and have a few questions that you can hopefully help me answer.
  
Are there any essentials that are hard to get by in Hanoi? My employer will arrange a moving company, so I have the option of stashing up in Rome before the move. 
 
Where should I live? I am looking for a neighbourhood with a good connection to the Old Quarter for my daily commute (see Q3). I'm coming alone and would prefer an area with a local vibe that is relatively quiet and clean. My employer pays for my accommodation so fortunately I have a wider choice budget wise. 
 
Is my e-bike enough or should I buy a scooter? I currently own a VanMoof S3 with a top speed of roughly 30 km/h.
 
I have the opportunity of following two weeks of full-time language classes. Can you recommend any schools? A school slightly outside of Hanoi with room and board is possible too. 
 
How to get social? I am no noob to making new friends in new environments, but any tips are very welcome!
 
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found Vietnamese businesses like restaurants and coffee shops abroad to be really unfriendly. On several occasions we went inside a Vietnamese restaurant and were completely ignored. So when we finally went on vacation to Vietnam, we were not expecting much in terms of customer service...
 However in Vietnam the customer service turned out to be fantastic! Restaurants and coffee shop workers were really friendly. Hostel owners would treat you like family. Even tiny food stall owners were super kind. Locals would help you order food and give you suggestions. It was really like some kind of Customer Service Fairy Tale
 Then I came back from the vacation, and decided to go to a Vietnamese coffee shop. The cashier didn't say anything at all when I ordered.
 I'm just wondering why there is such a huge discrepancy in customer service between businesses in Vietnam and abroad

I’ve been using Grab for a few weeks now and have only contacted drivers through the app. The Grab app says that it has “number masking” so that my actual number isn’t visible. Thanks

 But damn can they hold some serious volume and don't spill shit everywhere. 
 I've even used it to grind blueberries etc. in a bowl like a mortar and pestle. 
 Amazing. And they stack so nicely!

 We already have a scheduled visit with RC Group to discuss flooring / tile and would love to hear this subs recommendations for other manufacturers. Our main distributed products are vinyl flooring , plywood, kitchen cabinets , counter tops , kitchen hardware , tile and biomass boiler systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chao ban! I'm wondering about how some of the Indigenous religious traditions overlap (if at all) as I reconnect with precolonial heritage.
 A lot of the articles I read seem to put more emphasis on Len Dong / spirit mediumship happening in the North but also with a handful of practitioners in diaspora like in California of the US who have been trained or came into the role through heredity (e.g. family has a history of it).
 For Ca Ong/whale worship, a lot of coastal villages including the one part of my family came from still do it, but we're disconnected from the culture due to deaths in the family and immigration away from the country. And it seems each village celebrates their festival differently at different moons (TraVinh where some of my relatives were from for example is supposedly on the 3rd lunar month, others do the 6th), and some blend Buddhist traditions with the mourning of a deceased whale, while others remain rooted in Cham culture, and others potentially adopted the Nguyen Dynasty's official policies to worship Can Ong but kept their own local practices too.
 So I'm wondering what the ceremonies and protocols are like, and if the two religions ever overlap, what the ceremonies entail, and what route might be good to inquire further to connect with first.

 It seems like a simple question, but I’ve received different answers from locals, relatives, and the internet. To make it more confusing, the meaning seems to have change from older to younger generations. Can you help?
 Is Viet Kieu: - someone born in Vietnam that now lives overseas - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry - someone born in Vietnam/OR overseas with Vietnamese ancestry who now wishes to live in Vietnam again?
 And more importantly (for me)…does Viet Kieu have a bad connotation for locals?
 Thanks for your help!
 Edit: Added small detail for clarity. And wow, thank you for all the thoughtful responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the best thing to do when you are stuck walking towards your destination with a feral dog up ahead. 
 Sometimes the option to "re-route" is blocked by yet another feral dog who came out into the street behind you. 
 I've noticed they have a tendency to follow a person if they try to walk away. And obviously running is stupid beyond all belief. 
 Is there a safe way to pass one of these possibly rabid beasts?

I would like advice on if I should it solo or with a small group. I have seen from other posts that some groups from places like Jasmine or QT are sometimes as large as 30 people. To me that doesn't sound like a great time, but I would like the social aspect that comes from a group. Does anyone have recommendations for a company that does tours of less than 10? Or anyone that had an experience where they started solo but met people along the way to drive with.

I see there is a lot of tailored clothes, suits, silk etc., but can't find much about linen? I had little time to organise myself and would like to buy shorts, trousers, shirts - in linen, locally.
 Is this a thing in Vietnam?
 EDIT: I wonder what makes you downvote this post, when asking a simple question about your country. please tell me how I offended your personality and made your day bad by asking about clothes for personal use...

 Are there any YouTube channels, books, or articles—any learning materials—that teach the ignorant (me) about Vietnamese religious traditions?
 My partner and I are raising our child here (2 years old currently), and we want them to be as understanding as possible of the Vietnamese religious traditions. We’d even like to put up a family altar if we can figure out how to do it right.

We are planning to send her to international school and since we want to live near her school, it seems as our two options will be D2 or D7. These aren’t the neighborhoods I would pick but we want to live near the school to make commuting less annoying. We are having a hard time deciding between the two and would love any insight! 
 What are the nice apt buildings in D7 in the Phú Mỹ Hưng area? Some of the buildings in D2 had such nice facilities and landscaping and I am struggling to find something comparable in D7. We’d like a building that’s lively, lots of kids.
 What I love about D1, 2, 3 are the cute coffee shops and small stores. And the street food. D7 doesn’t seem to have any of that, right? Just wanna make sure I’m not missing something…
 Not sure if anyone on this subreddit is a parent but would love to know if the families in D2 and D7 are younger families or older and more established with lots of kids?

 Background: Family has one of the tallest houses in the neighborhood, so installing a cellular tower would drastically improve reception for the entire neighborhood.

Since my main purpose in doing this is to practice my English, I won't require any charge from you. But I have to make it clear that I'll need you to cover all the travel expenses such as food, and accommodation fees on the way for me, because I'm quite broke now and can't afford to pay those. And in return, being a local I have experience about what to avoid while being in the country, as I'm familiar with the law and many other things here, as well as knowing which places are cheap and safe, which are overpriced, and which services are good and which scams to avoid.
 I don't mind traveling by motorbike, for I have one of my own. so feel free to reach out and DM me :) I'm currently living in Ha Long, a tourist coastal city located 150km to the east of Hanoi. If you are visiting or planning to visit my city, we can also meet and befriend and I will show you around if you're interested.

We need to send just over 100K USD from the USA. Wiring/bank transfer of the money would be our safest bet I am assuming. If this is the case, will I be able to open a bank account in Vietnam with only a family visa? I am not able to get Vietnam citizenship reinstated. However my wife is, and she is currently waiting on the paper work to be finished. The property will be the in-law’s name. So I am not worried about loosing said property. Next question that I have is once money is in hand, in Vietnam, what is normally done/happens to transfer the title? Is it a red flag if a newly built condo does not have the red book,title? I was told that this is because the condo was recently built and at this time all units are not sold or finished yet. Though I do know that people have been living in that building for ả least 5 years. One would think that my in-laws would be able to answer these questions. But they have been living outside of Vietnam for 40 years. And I have no close relative alive in Vietnam to ask. Please excuse any poor wording or grammatical errors. Writing coherently in is still a struggle.

I am already prepared that i can’t cycle back on Sunday. I was thinking is it possible to bring a bicycle on a local bus back to Hanoi? I’ve taken the local bus 71 before also and it got quite full that time. I could also use a taxi but i heard it would cost over 1mil VND and im thinking what would be most convinient way.
 Thank you in advance! 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[- Many motorcyclists don't wear a helmet, especially during rush hour, and traffic police just ignore them, and they even pass right next to them.
 - Many will turn right or left at the foot of a bridge, even cars. What's worse, there are vendors on a freaking bridge!
 - Being on the phone while driving or riding. Worse, texting!
 - Cutting corners is a very common practice. 
 - Double parking, particularly in narrow streets.
 - The most dangerous, I think, is beating the red light, especially without a helmet.
 ​
 I hope the government will have stricter traffic regulations. These situations appear to be everywhere, at least, in where I live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I've been creating a playlist on Spotify with music from Southeast Asia, including both traditional and more recently recorded songs. I wanted to kindly ask you for any songs, artists, or records you would recommend me to add to the playlist. 
 I am grateful for any suggestions - except maybe noisy EDM or cheesy mainstream pop! :p It doesn't matter from which Southeast Asian nation the music is from, I prefer explore songs that are sung in a native language, though, and not in English - if the music even includes voice recordings. 
 Regarding music which has been released in recent decades, I do particularly enjoy indie rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and post punk, among many other genres.
 When it comes to traditional/older recordings, I appreciate to explore basically everything! =) 
 So, many thanks for any recommendations in advance! ;) Here's a link to the playlist if someone's interested in listening to it, too:

 I recently bought a few houseplants, such as the one in the photo. I have no idea what kind if plant it is, just that it is not doing so well. The leaves are turning brown and dropping off. 
 I've had it for about 2 months, and kept it inside our apartment, watering every few days so that the soil doesn't completely dry out. I've moved it outside as I thought it might need more sunlight, but it still is struggling.
 Any tips please? I hav no idea on how to care for plants in tropical climates. Also, what is this plant called?
 Thanks!

I have proof of my flight back to Thailand, but will I need to buy my ticket from Thailand to the USA to get on my flight to Vietnam? If so can I get a flight that is 2 months after my reentry into Thailand? If not I may need to get a flight where I can adjust the dates later. Let me know your suggestions if this is required.

 I'm considering visiting Hanoi and scoping out how accessible it might be for someone in a manual wheelchair who'd like to avoid driving. I currently live in Yosemite National Park as its only employee in a wheelchair, so I'm used to standards below what's technically legal in U.S. cities, and am used to having difficulty with transportation, groceries, etc. I have some specific questions, but in general I'd really appreciate some perspective from people with mobility impairments of any kind. Examples of commentary I'd find very useful:
 Do expats see many disabled people among middle class society?
 Are we treated differently in ways that are negative?
 Would I have a harder time getting or maintaining a job because of a visible disability? (Will I be discriminated against more than I already am in the U.S.?)
 Would it be difficult to find an apartment that's more or less accessible without it being considered a luxury or additional spending requirement?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, I'm going to HCMC and will be meeting my Vietnamese girlfriend (who lives with her parents).
 I'd like to stay near District 1 but it's my understanding most hotels won't let her visit by law because we're not married. She says it's probably fine and she can talk to the desk and tell them she's actually my GF to smooth it over but won't research ahead of time for me which is frustrating since she's so confident this will work anywhere (internet tells me otherwise).
 I found some sites listing "girl friendly" hotels, but they all look pretty dumpy (what you'd expect for that crowd).
 Does anyone know any decent 4-star or so hotels in District 1 that would allow her? I've started to email some places in the meantime. Budget is around $75-150USD/night which should be plenty. I'd like to not stay in a rundown brothel which many of the places that allow guests seem to resemble.
 Thanks!

 I was in Vietnam for the first couple weeks of March and have been back in the U.S. for a little over a week now. I cannot stop thinking about my time there, and can't seem to shake the feeling that I wish I was back. I was hoping this feeling would have subsided by now.
 My question is, for those of you who have been through this before,

She has to go from Da Nang to Hue, looked on Da Nang's airport site for recommendations, does anyone here have any others? I saw Grab mentioned, but she barely knows how to use her smartphone, so that may be out. She also has quite a bit of luggage and two other individuals coming along ,so a large van will be needed. Is there anything I could do on my end (U.S.) to book something? Or just give her one of these numbers? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps it's just me, but this is the direct experience I've had whilst living in Hanoi for the last 4 months. I have my local vinmart, and another vinmart down the road and a circle k. I have to say, my experience of customer service has been the worst I have ever experienced. At the one store, the same girl (in her late 20's), just looks at me and has this look of contempt, of anger almost, grabs my items, scans them then points to the screen in a really 'I can't be bothered, hurry up' way. She grabs my card scans it, prints the receipt and just hands it to me, not even a smile, a nod, a goodbye, no eye contact. The other day she takes the basket and just throws it on the floor. Then again, tonight, the other store, I go in, the young man didn't say one word to me the entire time. No hello, no thank you, no goodbye (in Vietnamese.. I don't expect English)... And just slammed the receipt on the table and continued chatting. My question is, are these people taught by their companies to observe any form of customer service? Is it because they are shy? (even though they stare at me and even once sighed at me for taking too long to use my phone app to pay even though their card machine wasn't working)? Is it because they have no idea what to say to foreigners? Because I've been to other countries and a simple head nod, or even small gesture to acknowledge the customer and make him or her feel welcome isn't so difficult is it? Now I rather hate going shopping now. It is not an enjoyable situation and I'm wondering if anyone else has the same experience in Hanoi. As a customer spending money in these stores I feel entitled to some form of customer service. I dont expect much, but a simple xin Chào, cam on or even a smile to the foreigners who are living and working hard here (or even tourists spending their money here) isn't so difficult... Or is it?

Over the phone I had no idea I wasn’t speaking to an American and heard Jim and didn’t think anything of it. When we met in person I realized he was of Asian descent and when I heard him say his name I realized it wasn’t Jim. 
 The best I could describe his name would be how the English word “You” would sound with an “M” at the end, Youm. He said it’s pretty common for people mistake it for Jim. But I’m having trouble figuring out how his name is actually spelled. 
 I’m hoping this is a common enough name that I could easily get an answer here. Thank you in advance.

Mắm tôm and similar should not be an option because I need to make sure I can check it on the airplane.
 
We usually use it to dip BBQ meats. Usually venison during hunting season or beef or pork ribs.
 
Great if I can order it online. I don't live in HCMC but occasionally get there for a day or two.
 
 As for myself, what do you suggest for a very hot/spicy sauce? For me even the Cholimex "tương ớt cay nồng" is not very spicy though it's almost there.

 I am interested in moving to Vietnam and working for a year. I have quite sensitive health problems, blepharitis and quite serious eczema; right now I have them both fairly under control but am quite concerned that the pollution will cause it to flair.
 Ideally, I want to move to Hanoi, but am also considering Saigon as I heard it's better air .I fear the air might affect my health problems. I would happily buy an air filter, mask, and try my best to avoid rush hour.
 Am I worrying too much? Is a year short enough to be relatively safe?
 What are your experiences, thank you!

I eventually ended up getting a headache, dizziness and just couldn’t sleep without worrying that this bus was gonna crash or something.

To top it off, it could cost me my job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I (21M) was born in 2001 in HCMC Vietnam and my mother's side originated from the HCMC region whilst my father's side originated from the North (he was born in Hanoi by the way). Even though both my parents, both my sisters (33F, 21F), and I have visited Hanoi several times, most of my mother's side has never visited North Vietnam yet (north of 17th parallel), despite the fact most of her relatives still live in Vietnam (from what I have heard from my mother, her side is quite wealthy and many of her relatives are business owners). Many of them only went around the Southern third of Vietnam and the furthest North many of them has visited is Nha Trang/Dalat. In fact, for all of my mother's relatives in the US (most came during the mid-late 1990s), none of them went above Nha Trang and half of them only visited Vietnam once or twice afterwards.
 Despite the fact I have only lived in Vietnam for 5 years before moving to Russia to study in 2006 and subsequently moving to the US at 11 in 2012, I have visited Vietnam several times afterwards (my most recent trip was in 2019 by the way), and I have visited the following places:
 Ca Mau, Can Tho, Long Xuyen, Ben Tre, Vung Tau, HCMC, Tay Ninh, Phan Thiet, Dalat, Nha Trang, Buon Ma Thuot, Tuy Hoa, Quy Nhon, Pleiku, Quang Ngai, Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Vinh, Thanh Hoa, Nam Dinh, Hanoi, Hai Duong, Haiphong, Ha Long, Thai Nguyen, Sapa
 ​
  
I am curious if it is common for Vietnamese people to have never visited the Northern half (North of 16/17 parallel)
 Plus, how common is it for Vietnamese Americans to never return to Vietnam or only return there once since moving to the US

 I want to buy train tickets (e.g. Ha Noi to Hai Duong) and someone told me that I should buy them in a bank mobile app. Do all banks have this feature?
 Last question, when Vietnamese people go to the shops and they "chuyển khoản", do they mean paying with a card or is that some other way of paying that I don't know?

 Are there 5 star cruises there that take a less crowded route?
 We don't care so much about spending the night on the boat but seems like that is the standard way to enjoy it.
 I hear there are other bays nearby but that they are not any less crowded.
 Tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào!
 I am visiting Hanoi from now until friday, the 31st of april, and I am interested in getting a custom tailored mens suit! I just want a jacket and pants, but if the price is good I could be convinced to get a shirt and/or vest too. I am thinking of choosing a charcoal wool/wool blend material.
 I am in my mid-20s but want it to be a versatile suit, so nothing either super vintage nor super modern; Regular length and medium-width notched lapels for the jacket and a slim-straight cut for the pants would be ideal. I also would like the suit to have some stretch, as I often get uncomfortable with the restrictive/stiff feel of store-bought suits.
 My budget would ideally be 5million VND, but a lot of talk online about this stuff is from pre-covid times, so I don't know if that is a realistic number. Please correct my expectations if they are unrealistic.
 What tailors would be appropriate for what I am looking for, and what prices can I expect? Also: do I need to buy the fabric separately on my own, or will that be included in the tailor bill? Or would it be cheaper to buy on my own? 
 Any and all advice is much appreciated! Cảm ơn : )

 After Tam Coc, the plan was to do the Ha Giang loop, over the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, however if we stay the extra day in Tam Coc, plus the long journey, I’m not sure we will have 4 days to do the loop. 
 We have to be in Hai Phong Bay at 11:30am on Monday 10th for a trip to Cat Ba.
 So here is my question:
 Should we skip Tam Coc all together, get up to Ha Giang and just do the loop for as long as we can? Should we do the 2 days in Tam Coc and just do a smaller loop of Ha Giang? Should I stick to 1 day in Tam Coc and the 4 day loop of Ha Giang?
 It looks like if we decide to go to Tam Coc, we will have to get a night bus up to Ha Giang. And of course then another night bus from Ha Giang down to Hanoi. Lot of night travel - is it too much? Should we ease up and save stuff for another visit?
 Thanks for your help!

I'm 21F, Indian, and have a BA degree in History and am currently in my last year of law school. I have been seriously contemplating the idea of enrolling in a CELTA course and English as a foreign language full time, but this particular trip is going to have to be limited to 1 month. 
 I am looking at volunteering to to teach English or working with children in any capacity. I understand that my lack of certification and the duration of the trip is going to be an issue but I would be happy to be involved in any sort of volunteer work. I have previously worked as a college counselor for underprivileged children and been a paid tutor at an IELTS center in my city. 
 I have managed to find a few workaway opportunities that help you assist English language teachers and work on curriculum development but I'm not sure how legit they are. Please help connect me to any volunteer opportunities in the month of June.

Just arrived in Vietnam, rented a scooter in Mui Ne and within the first 15 minuntes I was taken to the police station. Tried to haggle the fine but in the end I left with 500k less in my pocket. 
 Given that I am not going to be able to produce a valid licence since Im already here and my IDP has only a B stamp: Are there any tricks to avoid being stopped or prevent the fine at all? I'm going to be renting bikes in Dalat, Da Nang, Nihn Binh and Ha Giang, so would rather not pay 500k each time.
 If not able to avoid police encounters, what would the minimum reasonable "fine" that I could settle for?

 Most of the other discussion I see mention resorts for beaches but are the public beaches here good? My wife suffers a bit from too much sun so we wouldn’t mind having umbrellas and facilities at the beaches! 
 We will also spend a couple of days towards the south west of the island if anyone jas recommendations?
 Thanks a lot in advace!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Vietnamese! I spent a wonderful 10 day trip in Hanoi a month ago. I loved it and I want to be back for another remote working period, maybe in Da Nang. My only concern is the internet speed, as my job relies heavily on Zoom meetings. Last time the connection was bumpy, I had some serious issues one day and I am concerned. I read the news and know about internet cables, but I prefer first hand information. So here I am, any feedback will be much appreciated. Thanks a lot!

 Is there a way I can rent a motor bike in Hội An or Da Nang and return somewhere in Hue? I won’t have the time to return it back to the original place. 
 Otherwise, would you recommend an alternative mode of transportation (like a bus) where I’d be able to stop and check out the view? 
 For additional context - I’m a budget travel so kinda looking for an affordable way to travel. Also, I’m an exercised driver in Canada but motorbikes are new for me so I’m not sure if this is a beginner friendly route.

 So I'm going to Ha Long Bay with my university and as part of one of the classes were doing a project (mini doc) about community perception of UNESCO world heritage sites and was wondering if anyone knew what the laws around filming in that area are. I wasn't able to find much information other than for large film crews and as this is a school project where I and another classmate would be interviewing 2-3 locals I don't believe we fall into that category. The setup would be minimal with a tripod, camera, mic, and potentially a very small light if needed. Any help or pointers would be appreciated!

 We asked around and looked online but there seems to be no sign of fresh keg beer. Don’t worry, we were able to hydrate with a few tasty green Saigon’s but today our pilgrimage continues.

 However, the comment section was flooded with people saying "Vietnamese people are so money-focused, materialistic, etc etc", in a quite derisive way. And not just in that post either, I've seen such comments on multiple occasions, and they pretty much annoyed me.
 Yes, I admit, a lot of Vietnamese people are materialistic. But do you know why they are that way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! 
 My girlfriend and I will be setting off on a 7 week trip in 2 weeks to South east Asia, including 3 weeks in Vietnam! Around week 5, we are hoping to take a 5 day trip round the Ha giang loop, and I wanted to discuss the logistics of this here. A few notes:
  
neither of us have ridden a motorcycle/moped before, but are confident car drivers. We have access to a 100cc motorbike for practice
 both of our UK drivers licences cover "AM" vehicles (motorbikes smaller than 50cc) but to ride up to 175cc, we need an A1 licence
 we plan to rent motorbikes in the islands of Thailand earlier in our trip, and gauge whether we think it is feasible to carry out 5 days of driving.
 We will be doing the Ha Giang Loop in early May
  
I guess my biggest question is what are our options?
 Should we try to get an A1 licence before we go? (It only takes a day AFAIK so we should be able to sort it before the trip) if we bother doing this, will we be able to get an IDP that works? I've heard conflicting reports regarding the state of IDPs
 Should we go as we are? In this case we'll need to pay off police I'm sure which isn't a huge deal but I'd be worried about getting our bikes impounded, especially half way through the loop
 Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!

We initially thought we would do the five lakes trail, but since our daughter is only nine and, to be frank, rather short for her age, we don't feel comfortable with the climbing part, as we are not sure she will be able to reach for the ropes. There are, supposedly, two trails to reach five lakes - do you also have to climb when you take the easier one (that is, not the adventure trail)? And has anyone done the peasant trail? I have not been able to find any information on this trail, except that it ends in a water fall and has the best likelyhood to see birds (which would actually be super nice). Does this trail involve any climbing, too?

I create cinematic content for businesses to use on their social media platform. I have 6 years of experience in social media content curation. My passion for filmmaking has taken me to many places. I have been traveling and volunteering around India, which has been a fulfilling experience. 
 Where I grew up very connected to the sea, I grew up on the island life fixing boats, painting them and a lot of community works as apart of the local lifestyle there, as someone who loves nature and sustainability, I'm excited to travel outside of my country for the first time to put my skills to work for a meaningful cause. I'm passionate about balancing sports like slacklining, skateboarding, and surfing. I've spent a good amount of time sharing and teaching these skills. I'm also a documentary filmmaker and love to capture the beauty of nature and the stories of people who live in harmony with the environment.
 Few volunteering opportunities I did : - Helped a farmer for 3 months on his produce somewhere in the lush hills of western ghats in India. - Volunteered for an eco-festival in India to teach skating and help the festival crew. - Volunteered in the himalayas to help build a home-stay with a sustainable lifestyle. - Helped a few homestays and small businesses to provide quality content for their social media.
 Let's work together to make a positive impact while exploring a new culture!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by a comment thread in a recent post, I started to curiously think about the ideological/political alignment of Vietnamese people (or, at least the users of this subreddit): how do you perceive yourself ideologically, disregarding one's support for the government - or lack thereof - as a political position itself?
 Do you appreciate traditional family values, free trade, private property rights, low taxation, strong military, social hierarchies, minimum social spending; are you into trade unions, social egalitarianism, progressive taxation, governmental support programs, free health care and education, gender equality? 
 Do you get thrilled by socializing the means of production, class consciousness, centralized planning, international proletarian revolution and anti-imperialism; or are you proudly "anti-woke", support the interests of Vietnamese people over everything else, think that LGBTQ+ people should just go back to the closet and believe that climate change is a globalist hoax?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, everyone!
 I am docked at the cargo terminal just outside Ho Chi Minh for the next few days, and I'd like to get to see some of the city, despite my hellish work schedule. For that, I have some questions:
  
Will I be finding much open outside after 11pm?
 Is it realistic to try to use Grab to have someone pick me up? The app as of now gives me an estimate of 19-20min for someone to even show up, and I know the drive to Ho Chi Minh is like 45min-1h.
 Does anyone know a taxi driver who I can contact to perhaps strike a deal to bring crew members in and out for the next couple of days?
  
My company organizes a shuttle bus but it runs only until 8-9pm and I usually leave work at 10pm. I only have USD, and cards. No local currency at the moment. As per Vietnamese authorities, I am also not authorized to wander about anywhere other than Ho Chi Minh, and just a night pass cost me 10 USD, otherwise I'd have 10pm curfew.
 Please help!

 Background info: I ordered a package from the UK, it arrived into VNSGNA but got no updates for 4 working days. So I contacted VNpost and this is their response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Vietnamese-American, and I feel as though I haven't developed a really positive relationship with being Viet. But, I would like to relate better to my background.
 For me, I associate the Vietnamese language and Vietnamese life with a lot of negativity. I think of Vietnamese people that are just really focused on money, friends who have issues with their parents, adults that are constantly yelling with each other, and people who just take out their insecurities on others because they want respect or validation,
 I haven't been able to have a lot of positive interactions and associations when it comes to being Viet. Viet life is just viewed as a source of turmoil to me sometimes.
 If you also feel this way about being Viet, please comment your emotions below.
 I know some people who have a good and healthy relationship to being Viet, but I'd consider them to be few. I'd really like to have a better relationship to being Viet, because I feel like a lot of us hate ourselves. Historically, it looks like a lot of us have just wanted to attach ourselves to other larger empires, such as China, France, or America. And, that makes me kinda sad. 
 The few people that I know that have a positive relationship to being Vietnamese come from good, healthy families. But, our community has a lot of trauma, and, to me, that makes those good families become uncommon.

I joined this sub to be able to live vicariously through everyone else traveling while I am not in VN and what I’ve experienced so far is a bunch of nasty people giving travelers shit for not giving every single detail about any given trip or cultural question. If I hadn’t already been to Vietnam and found out that the people there are, by and large, much more friendly and welcoming, this sub would 100% put me off from traveling there.
 (Of course, judging by some of the comments I’ve seen, a lot of you isolationists would be fine with it.)

To compensate our daughter a bit for all the walking and looking at things, we had considered visiting the Aquatopia water park. As we know by now, the free shuttle bus has been discontinued, but we found out that the public bus #11 (which also runs from the airport) goes close enough to the cable car station. Only unfortunately it seems that the bus is also no longer running, at least I can't find any information about it on the net (not even on the airport page). Has anyone ridden the bus lately or knows that it no longer exists? If it runs, we would look for a hotel along the bus line, otherwise we go, as actually planned, to Ong Lang and forget the thing with the park simply (I have no desire to pay 60€ for cabs to Cable Station and back, then we rather invest the money in as much ice cream as she can eat...). Or are there any other public busses, preferably from/to the Ong Lang area?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been on a culinary journey lately, exploring the delicious world of Vietnamese breakfasts. We all know and love Pho and Banh Mi, but there's so much more to the Vietnamese breakfast scene that often goes unnoticed. Recently, I've discovered a lesser-known but absolutely mouthwatering dish: Banh Cuon Cao Bang! 😋
 For those who haven't tried it yet, Banh Cuon Cao Bang is a delicate and savory rice noodle roll filled with minced pork, wood ear mushrooms, and shallots. It's usually served with a side of fresh herbs, cucumber, and a tasty dipping sauce. It has quickly become my go-to breakfast choice, and I'm eager to find more dishes like this!
 So, fellow foodies, I'm asking you: What are your favorite Vietnamese breakfasts, particularly the lesser-known ones? Let's uncover some hidden culinary gems together and share our love for Vietnamese cuisine. Please share your favorites and any stories or memories you have associated with them. If you have any secret spots or recipes, feel free to share as well!
 Looking forward to reading your responses and expanding my breakfast horizons! 🍽️
 Cheers and happy eating! 🥢

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/Vietnam!
 I'm currently looking into getting the best out of my Phin filter as I recently got a decent hand grinder. People over at r/coffee tend to be pour-over and aeropress guys so I don't read much about other brewing methods there. That's why I decided to ask here. :)
 Any tips on getting the best brew? I personally haven't tweaked much from what I usually do these past months when I first had a phin: Grind 14g of beans using setting 3 (medium fine) for my 6 click cheapo grinder that I bought over at Shopee, preheat the brewer and the glass, dump the grounds on the brewing chamber and shake to level, drop the press filter and press a bit (this one I'm not sure if necessary), pour hot-off-the-boil water about twice the volume of the coffee into the chamber to bloom the grounds and wait for 30 seconds, pour water to the brim of the chamber, then cover to retain the heat. Drip finishes at around 6 mins.
 I usually make coffee via pour-over and I love the different nuances in the process and how each factor affects the output of the brew, But I love the simplicity of the Phin and how no non-sense it is -it's brute force coffee.
 Also, what should I look for if I want to buy a better Phin filter? And if you are a Timemore C2 user, what is your current grind setting?
 I would love to hear from you guys. :) Thanks!

 But hey, Cambodia is no superpower. Brunei is ASEAN's minnow. East Timor also a minnow. People will not blame them if they didn't schedule.
 But Vietnam? The nation that reached the final round of FIFA World Cup qualification and yet the national team is left starved with domestic league suspended for a month to serve the U-20 and U-23. For what? Professional countries will not interrupt domestic leagues for youth tournaments, only Vietnam does.
 Who is responsible for this? Who deliberately starved the national team?

 We fly out of HCMC so we're planning on Da Lat being the last place we visit and then getting bus to HCMC the night before our flight (we've both visited HCMC before so don't feel the need to go again).
 Just trying to figure out how many days to spend in Da Lat, i.e. should we do 2 nights, three days or one night, two days bearing in mind we have a small child with us so will probably be sticking to Da Lat rather than going on any trips in the nearby area. 
 What do people think?

 - Easy rider who drives safe and is friendly
 - Small group tour (max 8 people)
 - Staying in authentic homestays 
 - Off the beaten path/away from other tourists as much as possible (acknowledging that I am a tourist myself)
 - 4 days/3 nights would be ideal but open to slightly longer
 Also, I will be coming from Sa Pa, so any advice about transport between Sa Pa and Ha Giang is welcome. Thanks so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My mom is going back to vietnam next month and I’d like to send my cousins some gifts. I know he really likes music and a big trend in the US has been new music coming out in retro record players. 
 Has that hit Vietnam yet? If I got him a record player, could he buy records to use? Anything else a young 20something kid who likes music and photography would want from the states?
