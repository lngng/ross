 We are looking to do some ongoing volunteer work in Vietnam. Either with animals or children. Preferably in HCMC. 
 Does anyone have any recommendations? 
 I have searched Google and found a few places but we aren't sure.

 Cơ mà tìm hiểu kỹ thì đợt trước e thấy mời một bà hoạ sĩ khác về chủ yếu là để cosplay (thông tin thu thập từ video có thể không hoàn chỉnh). Mà bà hoạ sĩ lần này mời về thì cũng nổi tiếng cái trào lưu “artist vs art”, trên page thì cũng nhấn mạnh cái này vài lần nên là e sợ lần này cũng chỉ cosplay thôi.

 My wife’s never rode a bike before and is a little bit sceptical about doing the loop however advised she’d do it if it was on a quad.
 She doesn’t want to do it with another rider and I don’t want to do it on a bike with her on the back of me as i think I’d enjoy it more myself on a bike.
 And we would prefer a group rather than self hiring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I was always wondering what people in socialist countries think of socialism or the concept of Marxism, I thought Vietnam would be the best to ask the question. 
 Obviously asking people in the r/Vietnam subreddit won't get nearly correct answers as people here tend to be more influenced by Western English media but despite that I'm curious at least what the userbase here think/what they see in the country.
 Mainly I want to know it is because I am a Marxist and uphold countries like Vietnam because of how well they progressed and despite Doi Moi I see it as an effect of proletarian power. My country itself was heavily progressing from awful living conditions during socialism but unfortunately we had system change.
 TL;DR: How do you/the average Vietnamese feel about socialism (if there even is in Vietnam after Doi Moi) and Marxist theory?

After a few months I'm now a regular in the open mic scene here. So I wanna make a list of coffee shops and pubs that host open mics night in Hanoi and the days they occur. If anyone has any questions, please give me a shout-out.
 Here are some notes:
  
Vietnamese open mics are often quite restraint and polite, there are a lot of shy wanna be singers, but it’s just a glorified stripped down acoustic karaoke session with pianos and acoustic guitars, so unless you bring your own stuff, it’s mostly just that to show your singing and instrumentalist skills
 Western open mics are quite fun, exuberant and chaotic due to the presence of a stage for electric instrum…]]></summary>

 I noticed the sellers will ask how many item do you want to buy first instead of the price tag. I then ask again how much is it, she said something along the line “Morning price, first customer you don’t say that to me, I sell to you, how many do you want to buy?” 
 Since she didn’t answer my question, I told her I will come back and walk off. 
 Was I rude? Is there a cultural thing or is it rude to ask how much are the price of items here? 😅

 do you have any tips for differentiating what to call people as to not seem rude or offend them?

 New account due to privacy reasons.
 I cannot wrap my head around VNese housing market. Used to live in Hanoi, HCM and Danang. Currently scouting Danang properties. Seen maybe over 100 various land/houses options within 5-20B range. And it just throws me away, as I cannot see any logic, behind pricing strategy.
 For example, I've came across several options such as 180sqm land cost 7B, and then 2 parallel streets further - 12B or so. In comparison, neighbourhood is the same, surrounding space/layout was similar too.
 The market seems very saturated. Tons of listings for bigger land (150sqm+). With huge price fluctuation (35M/sqm - 70M/sqm).
 My question is, how does one can buy any of this? With current mortgage rates (12-15% after excluding first few years) it's a money burn going that route. Further, if I understand correctly, VNmese are not very encouraged to take this route, since rates most of the time we're high (~6%), compared with West (1-2%).
 I can only see smaller properties to be in a hot market (3-5B), as it's easier to deal via loans/mortgages, but going further, especially 8B+ route - it becomes a madness.
 Given the market in HCM, I'd see that there is no stop in price increase. I can feel now that it's more of a stagnation period. I'd like to believe, that prices would come down, but at the same time - I feel that greed will be the driver for prices fueling up. However, question appears - how long can this last?
 What I guess, VNese take 7-9% fixed mortgage for 2 years, buy something and try to flip it. Is there any other way, they are able to afford and buy lands/houses for that much?
 What keeps me up at night is that there is just so many listings in Danang, prices seems to be inflated and yet, sellers aren't willing to go much lower. However buyers market is definitely not here as well (for at least 8B+ listings).
 Would love to hear your experience and thoughts while navigating this market!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For anyone traveling to Vietnam, I can only say: the typical “Ninh Binh, Halong, Hơi Ăn, etc.” stops are great in their own right, but the mountainous northwest of the country can make you fall in love. 
 To me, there’s just no place like it. The Viet Bac, the Tay Bac, these places are so alive with culture and the scenery is stunning. 
 There isn’t always as much tourist infrastructure, but if you can ride a motorbike then get on it and go.
 October/November is a wonderful time to travel here. Avoid the rainy seasons due to very real risks of landslides.

 As the title says, can I have some travel advice by someone in Da Nang or who has travelled in Da Nang today (since the Level 4 Disaster flood warning was issued today [for the first time in history apparently.]).
 We have a train into Da Nang tomorrow and a flight out of Da Nang two days after.
 We are wondering whether we need to make changes to our plans, or whether taking the risk to go is an okay decision.
 🇻🇳 VN Chào mọi người 
 Như tiêu đề đã nói, tôi có thể có một số lời khuyên du lịch của một người nào đó ở Đà Nẵng hoặc người đã đi du lịch ở Đà Nẵng ngày hôm nay (kể từ khi cảnh báo lũ lụt thiên tai cấp 4 được ban hành hôm nay [rõ ràng là lần đầu tiên trong lịch sử.]). 
 Chúng tôi có một chuyến tàu đến Đà Nẵng vào ngày mai và một chuyến bay ra khỏi Đà Nẵng hai ngày sau đó. 
 Chúng tôi đang tự hỏi liệu chúng tôi có cần thay đổi kế hoạch của mình hay không, hoặc liệu chấp nhận rủi ro để đi là một quyết định ổn. 
 ———
 EDIT: We’ve called some sources who state that the train station is less affected than the airport. Would anyone be able to validate this?
 EDIT: Chúng tôi đã gọi cho một số nguồn nói rằng nhà ga xe lửa ít bị ảnh hưởng hơn sân bay. Có ai có thể xác nhận điều này không?

 My partner, toddler and I have so far spent time in Hanoi, Ninh Binh and Ha Long Bay. What an incredible country, we are having such a great time. We came knowing that it was the wet season but the day we got to Hue my partner came down with some sort of tummy bug... 
 We're taking it easy for a couple of days and keeping the kiddo as entertained as possible but I'm now feeling a little concerned regarding our plans to travel to Da Nang on the 15th. 
 We are getting the train in and our hotel is very close to the beach in the center most part. 
 Judging from the news stories of flooding I can't see how us turning up will be a good thing for ourselves, and the already struggling local services. 
 From a travel weary father of a toddler and partner of a sick girlfriend, please may I have some advice on how to proceed? 
 Our flight leaves from Ho Chi Minh on the evening of the 19th and we have a connecting flight from Da Nang that morning. 
 Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys 
 Before I came to Vietnam I heard a lot of people saying that people from Hanoi are unfriendly especially compared to the south.
 Now I’ve been in Vietnam for 2 years I’m living in Saigon but frequently go to Hanoi.
 Before I went to Hanoi the first time I was kinda worried that people are not as nice. But quite the contrary was the case.
 I had lots of great experiences in Hanoi and people were generally friendly.
 I often heard that people there are not smiling but I didn’t see that at all. When people see me they show me a peace sign ✌️ or wave and invite me for a cigarette or the tobacco bong or this self made alcohol ( I think it’s ginseng but idk for sure ) 
 Generally I found people very open towards me,maybe those bad experiences people talk about only happen in the city center?
 What I also find interesting is that people talk to me in full blown Vietnamese which I find refreshing. They don’t dumb down or change to English, they just talk and try to make me understand with sign language lol 😂.
 Everytime I’m in Hanoi I feel like my Vietnamese improves a lot.
 Anyways just wanted to share my experience in Hanoi.

 I'm planning to do major cities, Hanoi, Halong bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An, Dalat, HCMC. Originally I was planning to start north and go all the way down to the south and fly out of HCMC. 
 But now I'm having doubts that this is the best route, weather wise and public transportation wise is it better to start south and make my way to the north or vice versa? 
 Any other tips welcomed :)

 Is it because so many locals keep them in tiny cages and they just want to roam with the ladies?

 Vietnam is a nation that is well-known for being extremely good at fighting wars, managing to gain independence from a strong nation like China, defeating the Mongols, and expanding down from the Red River Delta to the Mekong Delta, destroying Champa and Cambodia in the process. They also defeated the French, Americans, and Chinese forces which threatened their independence in the 20th century and managed to overthrow the Khmer Rouge which were battle-hardened troops, or so many internet historians say. 
 However, during the 18th-19th centuries, there were many wars the Vietnamese had against the Siamese over the control of Laos and Cambodia. While both sides had their victories and losses, the Vietnamese won more conflicts than the Siamese, which is weird since Laos was controlled by the Siamese while Cambodia was jointly-controlled, meaning that the Siamese gained more land in the war. 
 In 1800, Siam had a population of 4 million while Vietnam had a population of 7 million, almost 2 times more. 
 Without European colonialism, would Vietnam had conquered Siam like how they conquered Champa and the Mekong Delta? Or was Siam too strong of a kingdom to conquer? 
 Many Thais don't know much about the Siamese-Vietnamese wars since it is skipped over in history classes. As I'm not a Vietnamese, I don't know whether these wars are taught much in Vietnamese schools but I'm sure Vietnamese people are more knowledgable in their histories than Thais are in theirs. So I decided to ask the question here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that most of the tourists coming to Vietnam, or SE Asia in general, just hop on a moped with little to no experience. Everyone tells me the same thing to just "find a quiet road, fuck around for 30 minutes and you'll be fine", but also these are the same people that end up hurting themselves or worse - someone else. 
 I don't want a lecture on being a dumb foreigner causing accidents on mopeds because we don't know how to ride them properly, I'm genuinely trying to ask what is a relatively ethical and normal way to learn to ride a moped here? How do you go from no prior experience to taking on the sea of bikes in the big city?
 Currently staying in Hanoi and feel a bit limited to using Grab to get everywhere, especially for the future when I would like to travel to more rural regions that don't have the same accessibility without a bike. I obviously don't want to learn in the traffic here but what would be a good place to go and "fuck around" without anyone going about? 
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I had a conversation with a Russian-Vietnamese (who was born in Russia). She was not okay with Vietnam staying neutral in the Ukraine - Russia war. While I really don't appreciate her point of view, I can see why. After all, she is Russian and she wants people to support Russia. I also have seen the opposite story, where pro-West Vietnamese condemn Vietnam for staying neutral.
 The conversation, unpleasant as it was, was quite interesting. Which do diaspora Vietnamese community care more about, the interests of their native country or the interests of Vietnam ?
 For example, let's say if Taiwan and China went to war, would you expect Vietnam to do something about it for the interest of Taiwan / China because you live in Taiwan / China ? Cause I really don't see the point of Vietnam picking a side.
 Whenever you vote for your leader in your country, do you pick them for the interests of Vietnam ? When Trump got elected, my friends studying in US were absolutely terrified, because they were afraid of him imposing strict laws on immigrants, and that was not a good thing for Vietnamese who tried to work and study over there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If so, why?
 There is too many upsides to getting a Vietnamese passport, and NOT enough downsides.
 - The visa situation will get more stringent over time. Look at what happened post-COVID. One day, you will NOT be allowed to do infinite border runs, even on your 5-year visa exemption. Pre-COVID, it was VERY easy to renew your tourist visa inside the country. Post-COVID, much harder. Look at Thailand ... they charge $24K USD for their 5-year tourist visa ("Thai elite visa")
 - Vietnam's GDP rising.
 - Opening a business is easier. You don't need a Vietnamese partner who owns 51% share of the company
 My prediction is, it will only get HARDER & harder to get a Vietnamese passport as Vietnam's GDP rises ... just look at Vietnam's visa policy -- it's already hard for non-ASEAN tourists to get a visa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apparently, Vietnamese pronouns are really hard for many learners, so I decided to make that one of the first things I'd tackle in the language. Correct me if my explanation is wrong.
 Vietnamese has a few pronouns, of course. The pronoun for I is fairly common, for instance. However, it seems like Vietnamese likes to avoid using true first and second person pronouns, like other Asian languages. However, that means you need some other way to distinguish yourself and different people in conversations.
 Vietnamese chooses age and gender. You imagine that this person is a part of your family and choose a pronoun for you and a pronoun for them that agrees. For example, I would call myself big brother if I'm talking to a little girl and call her little sibling, and she would do that in reverse.
 Here's a chart I made with all the different pronouns: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1WGMQL-_9XU14HV8i4OgvW0fiPY50n4OUcoNOS0q8U/edit?usp=sharing
 I honestly think it's a fascinating system. You get to show respect for the listener in more ways than tu/vous in French, but you also don't have to change the entire sentence, like you would in Korean.

I soon realized they were probably together despite the fact it was odd as he could pass as her dad. He's a local, not an immigrant. She has a kid too.
 So days go by when I haven't made up my mind so I send her a message asking if said room is still up for grabs. She says it's been taken. But then proceeds to send me a message saying One thing I want to say to you is you are really handsome and have such a beautiful smile. This followed by a cheerful/smiley emoji.
 Well, what the heck?
 Isn't this at best inappropriate considering she's likely with this other guy? Am I missing a cultural difference?

 There was a person who in 1975 he was the director of the Vietnam war remnants museum. Like either he was the director, or some other high position. And then because of his expertise, he was chosen to be the director of the S-21 museum in the 1980s. 
 Does anyone know who this person was? I didnt take a picture of that blurb. But I remember it clearly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have a friend who is a foreigner and has lived in Vietnam for 4 years.
 He had a business visa before for teaching English in Vietnam for 1 year but quit the job and now working remotely for a foreign company. So he is living on an investor TRC & visa. 4 years ago, he had to renew his tourist visa once or twice by leaving Vietnam to Cambodia then entering Vietnam again.
 He now has trouble entering Vietnam as his entry date was on the old expired passport and he is holding his new passport. So at the Cambodia - Vietnam border, they didn't issue him the new visa for Vietnam. He went home, brought his old passport over and still they didn't issue him the visa because they couldn't find the stamp for his TRC on his passport. (what does this mean please help me explain this)
 He has to go to the HCM Immigration office for help. Now I have some questions:
 - Can a foreigner live in VN forever with just tourist visa? How many time can one leave and enter Vietnam on tourist visa? Can he do this for the rest of his life?
 - Can someone work remotely for a foreign country but want to live in Vietnam? What kind of paperwork he needs to be able to get a residence permit here?
 - How long an investor TRC last? Can one keep using his investor visa/TRC for multiple entries in Vietnam?
 - Can someone be a criminal (maybe not wanted) in their country or other country and can enter Vietnam without being recognized?
 - Can one commit a crime in the past and be able to apply for a job in Vietnam?
 - What kind of job can grant one a work permit? Does it have to be a full-time job?
 Is there any other possibility around this case where one won't be able to find a job in Vietnam, or not plan to but want to live in Vietnam? Is there any issue could hold one back from getting a job in Vietnam?

 My question is what business would you start if you have enough funds and your in-depth knowledge of the Vietnamese market. 
 I'm not fishing for answers only, I want to start a discussion on Vietnam's economy and her next stages and how Viet Kieu or even just general foreign investment can help accelerate that process. 
 Examining the market it's saturated with restaurants and cafes at all levels. I was initially looking into starting a steak restaurant at the 3-4 star range because of my contacts in my home country. But it seems so risky to try and capture that market. A lot of cost into renovations etc. 
 I really want to bring money back into the country in an beneficial way for myself too don't get me wrong. I guess maybe people more knowledgeable than I can answer, thanks.

I can probably guess that computer science education is not as advanced or well funded in other countries, so that is maybe the reason for using an older language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’m traveling to Vietnam for 5 weeks at the beginning of November. I am unsure of what to do for payment. I have a Wells Fargo Visa debit card and CitiBank MasterCard credit card; I am from the USA. I know most tourists pay in cash in Vietnam, but I am worried that my debit card won’t work at ATMs to withdraw cash. Unfortunately, I probably don’t have time to open a new debit card. 
 In addition, I am not sure of how to book through apps like Booking.com, Hostelworld, Grab, 12go, etc. Grab doesn’t seem to accept my USA visa debit card. I have been able to book a couple hostels with my US card but unsure if it will work once I land in Vietnam. 
 I predict I will spend $1-1.2k USD, but obviously don’t want to just carry that much cash to be converted to VND all at once. Maybe I will take $200 cash.
 Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!

 How I am staying at a 3 star local hotel, will the internet be reliable there?

 Are there any Internet cafe/we work type services that have a private room that I might be able to book for a couple hours in the middle of the night?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My partner and I will be traveling Vietnam next month (November 12th to 26th) for 15 days. I am thinking of exploring Hanoi, areas in the North, and not going any further south than perhaps Hoi An. We don’t want to rush too much so would prefer to stick to 3 to 4 places. I have some questions that I would appreciate some help with:
  
Ha Giang: We would really love to do the loop on our own but are not experienced on motorbikes so can’t really make that happen. We aren’t into guided tours so wondering if there is an alternative way to enjoy Ha Giang without doing the loop. Trekking perhaps? We are experienced overnight trekkers and like big days such as 10-15 miles per day hiking. Is trekking a good alternative to motorbiking the loop in Ha Giang? If so, can we do this on our own or would we need a trekking guide? To add, we aren’t against hiring a private guide for certain things, especially if it allows us to learn more about the area, just aren’t into big group tours.
 Ninh Binh or Mai Chau: My partner gets sick on boats and we also don’t really like overrun places so considering skipping Ha Long Bay. Would you perhaps recommend Ninh Binh or Mai Chau as an alternative for a few days? If you could only go to one, which would it be?
 Phong Nha Ke Bang: I would really like to go here but I know November is the rainy season there. Is it still worth trying to go? Can you do trekking or some of the caves without a guide or are guides required? I was planning on not going further south than Hoi An but should we perhaps try to skip some of central Vietnam and try to see somewhere drier such as Dalat?
 These are the places I would like to see but won’t have time for everything. What would you recommend removing/adding? We enjoy physical activities such as trekking, cycling, nature, sleepy towns, good food, the ability to explore by bike.
 
  
Hanoi
 Ha Giang
 Mai Chau
 Ninh Binh
 Phong Nha Ke Bang
 Hoi An
 Dalat
 
 Thanks so much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anglish is a thought experiment about what English would sound like if it had no loanwords from Latin, Greek, French, etc. Some examples are Uncleftish Beholding ("Atomic Theory" - all the scientific words which are borrowings from Latin/Greek are directly translated into English), and the Anglish Moot (an Anglish Wikipedia, basically).
 I'm intrigued (as a Vietnamese person) what Vietnamese would look like if we were to do something similar - no Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary, no French and English loanwords. Expressing scientific/modern concepts (and many everyday concepts as well - such as time; "thời gian/时间") without Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary would be very challenging, IMO - probably because Chinese has been influencing Vietnamese longer ago, and for a longer time, than Latin/Greek/French/Old Norse have been influencing English.
 From "Uncleftish Beholding", which calls an electron a "bernstonebit" (a calque of "electron", which comes from the Greek for "amber", "amber" being a loanword from Arabic by way of Old French), perhaps an electron could be "chớp con" (a calque of Chinese 电子; Sino-Vietnamese reading điện tử). Maybe a computer could be "óc chớp" (calque of Chinese 电脑). (Tính - all senses - is a Sino-Vietnamese word)
 Just to clarify: this is only a thought experiment by someone interested in languages.

Vì bố tôi hay đi uống, nhậu nhẹt về có lời lẽ quá đáng và xô xát với mẹ tôi.mẹ tôi không thích điều này nên hay cãi và lớn tiếng mỉa mai. Tất cả nguyên nhân của cuộc cãi vã là mẹ tôi cho "bạn " mượn 70 triệu không qua giấy tờ từ 8 năm trước đến bây giờ vẫn không trả đồng nào trong khi gia đình tôi hiện đang khó khăn vì chị tôi vừa lên đại học và cần nhiều thứ để chi. Và mẹ tôi còn mượn họ hàng tiền có kèm lãi, vòng tròn thiếu tiền =>mượn nợ=>trã tiền+lãi=> thiếu tiền xoay vòng liên tục khiến nhà tôi khó khăn hơn. Bố tôi cực kì bất mãn về việc này nên khi say hay dùng việc này để sỉ vã mẹ tôi. Khiến mẹ tôi không chịu nổi và muốn li dị, hiện tại đã viết giấy và chỉ cần ký và nộp toà là gia đình tôi đổ bể. Tôi đang đứng trước vấn đề muôn thuở của đề tài này " con chọn theo ai?" Thật sự thì tôi chả muốn họ li dị hay chọn theo ai cả, giờ tôi chả biết làm thế nào. Xin mọi người cho tôi một lời khuyên

 Been to various locations around Vietnam and the world, but I have never experienced such a high concentration of rudeness, in-politeness and general unprofessional behaviour than I have in Da Lat, second to Paris, of course.
 I've read many people here complain about the behaviour of locals (yet choose to stay), in my experience barely 1 in 50 interactions have been negative. Yet, in Da Lat, this was flipped where barely 1 in 5 interactions were pleasant. This included drivers at Langbiang (a massive tourist trap, but anyway) literally running to their Jeeps and quickly driving away when asked for assistance, attendants being more pushy to payment than I've experienced elsewhere, rude staff, attendants etc., incredibly dangerous and aggressive motorcycle drivers, and shop attendants promising to help with postal/online orders than ignoring messages or giving one word replies to detailed questions (messaged in vietnamese) when followed up with. Along with your usual long stares from locals, attempted rots at tourist traps etc.
 Before people jump the gun with "what do you expect in Vietnam/tourist place/being a forigner etc." I'm used to people in cities with lots of tourism being rude or just tired of the people who's income they rely on (Paris and Kyoto are notable examples), but what I experienced here was far beyond anything I have in other parts of Vietnam such as Da Nang, Hanoi or even HCMC.
 Is this something locals and other travellers have found? Do Da Lat people have a reputation for their attitude in Vietnam or did I just have several one-off experiences?
 Oh, sorry I forgot to start the post with "I love Vietnam, its people, its culture etc. but....", its implied

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnamese source here, and you can pretty much find the latest info about this greedy coach everywhere recently.
 A quick brief for those who don't know Vietnamese:
  
Vietnamese young athletes of the national table tennis team informed the public about how bad their daily meals were, and a big investigation was carried out 
 apparently they were supposed to have a 8-person dinner which cost was around 800,000vnđ (~32 US dollar), but none of the provided images about the meal proved such thing (fried tofus, boiled veggies, etc), and apparently all of them was being heavily under-fed 
 things turned out that a huge part of their provided money from the sport department was kept by the coaches
  
Latest news shows that the head coach explains that he's just keeping the money because some athletes have been scammed before by online deals, therefore he would be keeping all the money and return it to them at the end of the year.
 These greedy men are now fired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Israeli (guest)s rose to leave, Giap suddenly turned to the Palestinian issue. “Listen,” he said, “the Palestinians are always coming here and saying to me, ‘You expelled the French and the Americans. How do we expel the Jews?’” 
 The generals were intrigued. “And what do you tell them?” 
 “I tell them,” Giap replied, “that the French went back to France and the Americans to America. But the Jews have nowhere to go. You will not expel them.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whats up with the Chinese tourists here being so rude. Constantly pushing in lines, being rude to tour guides, at one point I saw a Chinese man tap snatch a pair of tongs a girls was using to pour food, poured for himself, and then gave them back. Definitely don’t think all of them are, just seen it happen so much in the 8 days i’ve been here. It’s almost as if the they believe that everyone is here to serve them. Chinese people I’ve met in Australia are generally well mannered, so completely baffled to why they are like this here.

They’re tied up in the same spot 24/7/365. Theres 3 in the pic, two tied up and one in a tiny cage, it can’t even barely move around in. I don’t see the point of keeping pets just to keep them as prisoners.
 Never had a walk, they bark constantly, more if you go anywhere near them. They must be suffering constantly. In developed countries there’s agencies that stop this disgusting behaviour..
 Do you think people in Vietnam will ever change their attitude to the treatment of animals?

Is it easy to book a transfer through the hotel? We would need a transfer from Hanoi to Halong Bay and then from there to Ninh Binh.
 What area should I stay in Ninh Binh?
 For tours do all hotels in Ninh Binh offer tours that you can book day of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just got into Ha Long (Bai Chay beach) last night. We are staying at a fairly nice hotel right off the beach in an area that is roughly six blocks squared. The area consists of only hotels, probably 60-80 establishments, of which only about 12 are open and active. Almost every other building, which is multi-stories and beautifully modern, is empty and dark with nothing inside the lobbies. There are maybe 3 cafes that might be open, and maybe 3 restaurants that offer 2-3 dishes each. 
 There is literally NOBODY here. In the 48 hours we have been here, we have counted about 15 other tourists on both the beach and the hotel area. Aside from that, it is completely deserted. The wide streets have almost no traffic, with a car or two (mostly taxis) going past every 15 minutes or so. 
 The closest place to buy beer/snacks/smokes is over a mile away. The beach itself had 2 other people on it until about 3 pm this afternoon. Everything is closed until about 4 when 1 place on the beach opened to sell beer and snacks. 
 So what gives? We understand that it is off season right now and most tourists come November- March. But this place is completely deserted. It’s almost dystopian. We have been to other places throughout south east Asia during off season and nothing compares to how completely deserted this place is. Does anyone know what is going on?

 I know a lot of apartment blocks in Vietnam have poor construction quality and whilst look nice are often plagued with issues such as sewage leaks etc. - how about Vinhomes though?

Everyone will have 10 days to settle their debate by battling to the death. The last surviving team will receive a medal.
 The fight will be advertised and broadcasted around the world which makes great profit and can help boost the economy
 I'm open to further improvement for this plan

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this question offended anyone, but I'm just genuinely curious. I can't understand why so many Vietnamese want to move to the US.
 I used to live in district 1, HCMC and there's insanely long line of people waiting at the US embassy basically everyday
 Basically all of the older people I know, and quite a few young people really like the US and want to move there.
 It's really far away, which makes flying back to visit family a huge pain. Things are also really expensive and it's getting rapidly worse. Immigration policy is strict, and it's even harder to get the green card to stay there.
 Not to mention the US has a lot of problems too. Just gonna mention 1: racism. I have heard a lot of stories about racism against Asian people in the US.
 I do think the US has quite a few things better than Vietnam, but if you can afford moving to the US then you can definitely afford moving to countless of other, much better countries. Even if just the English speaking ones, there are a few.
 My brother was obsessed with the US, moved there 8 years ago, worked really hard but still don't have green card. He is now starting to hate it and want to move to another country instead.
 My personal experience. I moved to the US and lived there for 1 year. I hated every second of it, my time there was horrible, and I was really depressed, even contemplated suicide a few times during my time there. Then I went back to Vietnam and my mood improved dramatically. After staying at home for a while I moved to Japan. Still living in Japan right now, and much happier than I ever was in the US.
 So what do you think? Please share your thoughts.
 Edit: The point of this post is not saying that Vietnam is better than living in the US. The point is why do Vietnamese people only care about and want to move to the US, while ignoring pretty much all other countries. Because if they can afford moving to the US, they can afford moving to those other countries

 I will be going on the Ha Giang Loop in December! Although I have not planned which agency or hostel I will be doing it with, I will definitely do it when I visit Vietnam in December!
 My question is, as amazing as it looks. There is one death road which does get me quite nervous. Its usually on day 2/3 which is just a narrow road with no gate and your basically at a cliff edge.
 My question is, are there any hostels which allow you to walk up this specific route? It's only a couple hundred meters but instead of being on a easy rider I would rather have much peace of mind walking up the route.
 Please let me know and any recommendations you may have! Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have been extremely lucky to become friends with a Vietnamese guy I work with. He has my wife and I over for food and karaoke multiple times a year with his whole family. We want to return the favor and have them over our house for dinner. I’m looking for suggestions on what American dishes I should make and which dishes I should stay away from? I’ve thought about trying my hand at some Vietnamese dishes but don’t want to insult them by possibly not making them right or whatever. I was thinking possibly going seafood route? Maybe some kind of seafood boil? Grilled fish? Maybe a pasta with clams? Or possibly smoking some beef ribs? I appreciate any input and suggestions. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im traveling to Vietnam next month with my pregnant wife and daughter of 1 y.o. We'll be staying in Saigon for 9 days and Phu Quoc for 3 days. Today we got our travel consult and vaccinations for our trip and the doctor said that they do not recommend traveling there in first trimester of her pregnancy, mainly because of the risks regarding the Zika virus. Does anyone know if Zika is still active in Vietnam and if so how many cases are there? And how worried/careful should we be? 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is something I’ve wanted to ask for a while. I am from Nepal but grew up in the US. Nepal had a lesser known People’s Revolution in 90s and 2010s. Currently I believe there are 3 major parties; “Maobadi” (far left, militant), Communist Party of Nepal (left), and Congress (center left). However I think a lot of younger Nepali people are starting to lose faith in leftist ideology. I am 24 now, and I feel like more and more I am shifting more towards the left politically, socially, and morally. But since you’ve guys had one of the largest revolutionary movements in history. What do YOU guys feel about it, is what I want to know. To be honest I don’t even know much about the politics of Vietnam and it’s society. So any input is valuable. Hope the mods allow this post.

 I have heard of other Viet Kieus paying agency to get their citizenship (passport, then CMND) ranging from $300 to $3000 USD.
 Edit: Some people are saying it's EASIER to do it while in Canada but why is it? Seems counter-intuitive, wouldn't it take longer because they want to see physical papers and that has to be sent from across the pond or no?

If this is not addressed probably, food poisoning will continue to rise even worse like the Banh Mi Phuong case. What do you think about this?

 First, we plan to spend a few days in Hanoi and then visit HaLong Bay from there. After that, we'll head to SaPa for 1-3 days. Then, we intend to continue our journey to Hoi An and wrap up our trip in Ho-Chi-Minh City. In total, we plan to spend 18 days in Vietnam. Should we change our destinations? Is there anything important we're missing? We appreciate every single response!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a tropical country with quite a few uses for coconut, the coconut palm/fruit makes surprisingly few appearances in folklore that I am aware of. Sọ Dừa is the only well-known story (to my knowledge) where there is a strongish allusion to coconuts. 
 Are there any origin stories for the coconut in Vietnamese folklore? I know that for example, many Polynesian cultures have stories about a giant eel who is beheaded and the first coconut palm grows from its head, explaining why coconuts look sort of like a face when you dehusk them.
 Or other folktales where coconuts/coconut palms play a significant role.
 Also, I've heard that coconuts with flesh/water that didn't develop properly are said to have been "eaten by the moon "(bị trăng ăn). I can't find any allusions to any other crops being eaten by the moon. Is there any specific mythology about why the moon eats coconuts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not joking. Serious question: do you guys give 70-90% of your income to your wife on monthly basis?
 I lived in Korea and Japan for 6 years and get married with a Korean woman speaking Vietnamese excellently. I often have conversations with Japanese and Korean male co workers and business partners. I swear they rarely do this. 
 Since my wife and I settled down in Hanoi, she has hung out and done yoga with some Vietnamese women in the neighborhood. Then, she went home and dropped hints by telling stories like:
 “Our neighbor A’s husband sends her 90% of his monthly income, so she can manage finance of the family for him, buy what they need and do saving. He only keeps 15 mil for his personal use.”
 I know she will never directly ask me to do that. My wife is typical modern independent Korean woman having good income as professional Vietnamese-Korean translator. I keep my own money and she keeps her own money. We have a common bank account to which both of us send money for family expenses. My annual income = 5x her income, so I contribute much more. She is the person who came up with this idea, I totally agreed. She bought 70% of stuffs in our house.
 Yesterday, I saw a video on TikTok. That guy says his salary is automatically sent to his wife bank account by his company, and his wife would give enough amount of money for his living. I viewed the comments to his video, and it seems many people do this. I guess they were joking (not sure), but his video really raised my curiosity to ask this question. I am asking the same question on a Facebook group. Let’s see how many of us actually do this hehe. 
 We are young family (30 husband and 28 wife). We may have the first kid next year, so a solid financial plan is a must.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can’t seem to find a “one way” cruise. 
 Also please critique my plan for cat ba plan. Open to suggestions
 My current plan is:
 November 5 Leave Hanoi for Cat Ba -Take Bus(cat ba express) to Cat Ba, speed boat included 7:45 to 11:30 $14 USD -Check in Hotel -Trung Trang Caves -Hospital Cave? -Hang out around Cat Ba -Rent bikes, scooters to explore island -This seems to be an activity driven island, biking, climbing, etc.
 November 6 Cat Ba
 Serenity Premium Cruise -It's more of LAN Ha Bay on the East Side of Cat Ba but they say it's more green and less crowded/polluted -This will depart from Cat Ba around 7:30 AM -Ends around 3:15 -$35 USD! -https://halongserenitycruises.com/ details/
 Hang out in Cat Ba for the night
 Latest flight from Haiphong to Da Nang is at 5:55pm. I don't think we can get to Haiphong in time to catch that so we have to stay the night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are looking for something that is all inclusive and offers relaxation. We have never expierenced a vacation together yet. Its been a lot of loss the past few years. From me losing my taste buds from covid after being a chef for 30 years has been hard and harder recently losing my father. (at first i was like maybe this is too much to share then i realize besides my wife i have zero family) im retired who is going to judge. We have been married 8 years. She is my everything, she has had a very hard upbringing through foster care and so much worse. I want to show her what its like to have something specifically made for her and have her pampered like she should of been when she was growing up. So if there is any hidden gems of people to see, places to stay, or heck even realitors to talk to... even sites to go to or person to person talk ideas..... Sincerely, Hoping this helps.....

 I hear vietjet is stingy with AC and prone to long delays. AirAsia flights times aren’t as desirable and they fly into DMK airport instead of BKK (not sure if that’s good or bad). I hear Vietnam airlines is regarded highly but their flights cost more. 
 I’m happy to pay a bit more for a better experience but the flight duration is 2 hours at max so not sure if it makes much difference? 
 Anyone have any strong opinions to share about any of those three airlines?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who didn't know, it's a mini truck/tractor-like vehicle used for transporting materials for construction. Folks living in modern city areas might have the privilege of not having to witness or experience this atrocity.
 Man, screw this damned of an ancient, older than dino-fossil, out-dated, dirty vehicle that pumps out zillion tons of harmful smokes, from black to blue in color, to the atmosphere for every meter it goes.
 I live in a suburban area where construction of houses is frequent, and this damned vehicle goes rampant on the street, crossing my house once every 3-5 minutes for hours straight, that's how crazy and obnoxious it is. My biggest problem is not its noise, but the amount of godawful enormous smoke emissions it produces.
 Ever travel on a road when you're riding a bicycle BEHIND this monster ? Yeah dude, have fun inhaling ALL that smoke this vehicle constantly pumps out of itself all the way until you reach your destination. This thing should absolutely be banned for harmful effects to environment and people alike.
 That's it. Thanks for coming to my TEDx talk

When i Booked, The website was set as Vietnam English (Locationa and Language) and I made the transaction in VND through an International Card. But when I'm checking the same flight through Trip.com or Global USD Mode of the Website, The prices are doubled. Did i just got a sweet deal or made a huge mistake?

 Chào các bạn, tháng 12 mình sẽ về thăm Việt Nam và đặt vé máy bay Bamboo Airways đi Phú Quốc đi Hồ Chí Minh. Khi tôi đặt chỗ, trang web được đặt là tiếng Việt (Vị trí và ngôn ngữ) và tôi đã thực hiện giao dịch bằng VNĐ thông qua Thẻ quốc tế. Nhưng khi tôi kiểm tra cùng một chuyến bay thông qua Trip.com hoặc Chế độ USD toàn cầu của Trang web, Giá sẽ tăng gấp đôi. Tôi vừa có được một thỏa thuận ngọt ngào hay đã phạm một sai lầm lớn? Sẽ có vấn đề gì nếu người nước ngoài đặt vé từ Trang web bằng VNĐ? Xin hãy giúp đỡ nếu bạn có một số thông tin liên quan đến điều này.

Tôi chả biết là điều này đúng không nhưng tôi ước rằng sẽ được gặp em một lần nữa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any stigma against them here? I know a woman, 28, who has photos of herself with her younger sister. Considering their 19 year age gap though, I'm beginning to wonder if the younger sister is her daughter. It's the way she holds her that makes me consider this. 
 I wonder if she disguises her daughter as a younger sister just to avoid potential stigma.

 I like the sound of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park. Would prefer somewhere that’s calming, friendly locals and good nature to explore by bike.

I called the number on the ATM and told my situation. He says I need to call my own bank and get a confirmation letter saying that it’s my card and take that letter to a Sacombank’s branch here on Monday. So I called my own bank (Citibank) and they tell me that they can only provide a Reference Letter with my account number (not the Debit Card number) and it will take a week to get that letter or they can expedite a card and send it by Tuesday. The issue is, I leave here Tuesday morning to Hanoi. That card is my only card for cash and what not. What the hell do I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Went to saigon just to watch HTL vietnamese concert. I just want to see her live and check on the concern scene.
 What I observed : 
 The concert venue looks like an old gymnasium with pipes on the way inside the concert grounds which is unsafe since someone can trip over. 
 But the stage and production value of the concert was superb. The stage has mulple large LED display panel, smoke effects and fire effects. There are orchestra situated in the back of large display panel. There is 3 or 4 different drones on the whole duration of the concert. And multiple cameras all over the place. 
 The songs performed was on her album hoang and link and the encore song is an unreleased song together with the artist in Gieo Que. 
 Most of the audience are singing along with the songs and they coordinatedly changing the color of their light sticks in the color of the LED display. 
 I really enjoyed the arrangement of the songs in the last 5 songs since it has a live rock band feel specially with the drummers performance. 
 About HTL performance though was underwhelming. Her voice feels to me is lipsynced (or maybe overprocessed?). There is no interaction with the audience and feels that it is a performance video and not a concert. I dont know if this a vietnamese thing since most of the concert i gone to has a least interaction to the fans / audience. 
 Overall i enjoyed the concert despite some flaws.

 We gave birth our daughter here. We spent a lot of money on her entertainment, health care, education… I hadn’t noticed much until I realized we spent over 50 million vnd on our daughter last month. I think it is quite much for me (i am bread winner). I ask this question to see how people spend money on raising kids in Vietnam and get some insightful suggestions. I need to reduce expenses (around 30-40mil is perfect) but still give our daughter the best things.
 Kindergarten Tuition: 15 mil
 Babysitter: 8 mil
 Child food and supplements: 12 mil 
 Child care product: 2 mil
 Clothes: 2 mil (she’s growing fast)
 Sport and entertainment: 3 mil
 Language education (English and Belarusian): 10 mil. My wife wants the daughter to speak mom’s language well. I can’t say no. I teach her Vietnamese with 0vnd. 
 Edit: please ignore my username, my wife just joked me :))

We are all over 75 and I read it could be muddy on the trek. My travel guy said not to worry because we can have our guide call a cab if it becomes difficult. Can anyone share their experiences on touring Sa Pa in January?

 From my understanding and experience, they are eaten in thailand, China, Malaysia etc but seem to be missing in vietnamese cusine. I know they have started to be farmed recently and I assume they must grow as they grow pretty much everywhere. Consequently most places I have had mussels here, even at good places, tend to be overcooked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like the title says, it's a joke. And not even a funny one. And here's my unhinged rant about it.
 Since the implementation of "simulated situations" test, the Vietnamese driving test has stooped to an absolute clusterfuck of bureaucratic mire, created by senile buffoons who I guaran-goddamn-tee you don't have the slightest clue what's it like to be behind the wheel.
 Here's the premise: you're given a medley of 10 clips, ranging from 40-50 seconds in length, showing situations that can happen on the road (the majority of them are half-baked 3D scenarios - how realistic). You have to press spacebar when you see a potentially dangerous action. There's a set time limit in which you have to mash the button, and you'll be graded anywhere from 0-5 depending on when you do it.
 Already this sounds like a horrible idea, knowing that there's heavy implication that your intuition can fuck right off and this is strictly a memorize-and-answer kind of test. You can see the sitch and press spacebar ZERO POINT ONE SECOND EARLY and it will be a wrong answer.
 WHO THE FUCK IN THEIR RIGHT MIND THINKS IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO FORCE FEED THIS SORT OF HORSESHIT INTO PEOPLE'S HEADS AND CALL IT A "TEST"???
 Apparently the Ministry of Traffic and Transports, with their infinite fucking wisdom, alongside whoever ratify the change, do.
 And the tragedy is, it's unlikely that this will be revoked, so anyone (including me) who thinks of getting a driver's license now can either suck it up or go fuck themselves.

Siargao Island, PH
 La Union Beach, PH
 Baler Beach, PH
 Cebu City, PH
 Bali, ID
 Jogja / Jogja Beaches, ID
 Hua Hin, TH (just 2 months)
  
Philippines used to be my home until I lost my job/home/friends during COVID. It was extremely painful for me and I never found a foot in Indonesia after the borders opened up. Being here in Da Nang is the first time since 3 years ago when I lost my home/everything that I get a sense of home and comfort even though I really can't speak the language aside from a few phrases and tones are driving me crazy lol.
 It's really nice here in Da Nang. Vietnamese people are kinder than I expected (people here say a lot of negative things about VN people), the beach is much cleaner than I expected as well. I just came from the beach and feel so refreshed. I love this city after just two days. It's a wonderful setup that allows you to walk so easily north to south and hop into random coffee shops. I wish I could make this place my home. Although probably unlikely unless I move to HCM for a job but yea, this place is so great.
 The only thing that's terrifying AF is how crazy you people drive here LOL!

 I went to the Dan Sihn market today. Great experience and saw a lot of war memorabilia, but I checked online and one article claimed up to 99% of the stuff was fake and most of the authentic things were bought a long time ago. This seems like an absurd number, so perhaps people here know this better than me; how much of the stuff sold there is real? Would you buy anything there?
 Thanks in advance. Having a great time in this wonderful nation!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All my life I was taught to be polite and respectful to older people. But some older people are so rude but then if you say something back you’re hỗn láo bad guy
  
Scenario 1: at Tan Son Nhat, in TSA line, this lady was extremely close to me. Every time I moved up, she inched up directly next to me. So I said “Cô, làm ơn đứng xa xa một chút giùm.” She stopped standing close to me and didn’t say anything but then started whispering about me to her husband saying “Con nhỏ mất dạy.” Like wtf did I do 😭 
 
scenario 2: getting off the plane. I was removing my suitcase from the overhead compartment. You know viet aunties do that nudge thing if they need to get by or they’ll tap you and say move. Well this lady started to shove me aggressively. There was nowhere for me to move since the people in the row above me were in the aisle. The first one, two times I let it go, even the third. Then she kept doing it getting more aggressive each time. This is where I admit I was being really rude back. I turned to her and said “cái gì vậy.” She stopped shoving me and looked at me with full on rage in her eyes like this 😡. Like ma’am, you’re the one shoving me 😭 
 
 I used to always yield to older people but now I’m starting to talk back to them because they can’t demand respect without being polite to others first

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In fact my baby is still in my body. My husband and I will probably meet him in December.
 Since I moved to Vietnam with my husband, many family relatives, friends of husband, co workers of parents in law have come to visit me and my unborn baby.
 They gave us many things like baby clothes, toys, nutritional food, baby care products,…. The new thing to me is that there is always an envelop of money attached in these gifts. It is often from 1 million to 5 million vnd. The old uncle of my husband even gifted me and baby 1000usd. It is quite strange to me. I feel shy when receiving easy money from people like this. Then, I behaved unnaturally when receiving the gifts from them.
 My husband family even say they may come back after baby is born.
 Why did they do that if they had already gifted us expensive tangible things?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been solo traveling within Japan, even though it's not my home country. I work here and have grown fond of exploring its diverse landscapes and culture. Now, with my birthday approaching, I'm considering a trip to Vietnam. Initially, I was thinking of Hanoi, but a Vietnamese friend suggested Hoi An in central Vietnam.
 Choosing between the two cities is a bit challenging. I usually start with major cities before exploring smaller ones, which leans towards Hanoi. However, the idea of a more relaxed, less touristy experience in Hoi An is appealing.
 I have six days and five nights, factoring in day trips to nearby places and wanting to immerse myself in local life, so I can't visit both cities at the same time. I'm seeking advice from fellow travelers and locals on which city to begin with. I enjoy sketching buildings and nature, and exploring cafes, so finding the right backdrop for these activities is important.

Nearly every “basic” word i learned that has an everyday usage (nha ga, ca phe, va li, sa bong, pho mai) comes from some french word. Are the loanwords mostly found in simple everyday words or also more complex words/phrases (politics, emotions, technical terms, etc) as well?
 If it was possible to make an estimation, approximately how much of the vietnamese language is derived from french?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I just booked my honeymoon in Vietnam for Nov. 24-December 8th. Would love any suggestions on the itinerary below:
 November 24-26th: Hanoi November 27th: Bai Tu Long Cruise (2 day/ 1 night) November 28th: Hanoi (to rest after the cruise & leave for Sa Pa early the next day) November 29th-December 2nd: Sa Pa December 2nd-6th: Hoi An/ An Bang Beach December 7th: last night in Hanoi before we fly out 
 I just had a few questions: 1. Firstly, I read that it’s the very end of the rainy season in Hoi A during early December. Do you think it’s still worth going and risking the rain, or would it be better to choose somewhere else? We want at least one relaxing beach time and also really wanted to see Hoi An. I also read it can be beautiful around Christmas. Is it worth it? Worried about being rained out the whole time but hoping if it’s at the end it might be okay. 2. Is Bai Tu Long bay as beautiful as Halong Bay? Worth it to book Bai Tu Long instead? 3. We’re planning on booking the EcoSapa limousine buses to/from Sapa and Hanoi. Are these a good choice?
 Any other recs/thoughts would be greatly appreciated (especially for a honeymoon vibe)! Thanks so much in advance ❤️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This album is a fusion of traditional Vietnamese folk culture with contemporary music styles, incorporating themes and stories inspired by Vietnamese literature. The album showcases accents from all three regions, and it even includes a song reminiscent of 'nhac do.' I've been listening to it on repeat since YouTube recommended the live showcase to me. What are your thoughts on this?
 I don't often listen to Vpop, and I feel like I've been missing out on a lot by only focusing on K-pop for years. Which other artists and their releases do you recommend? I particularly enjoy Truc Nhan and Trung Quan, especially singers who perform well live.

 While in the US this kind of establishment is regulaged by laws, and Paris, Berlin are more laxed with dresscode. But this spa was filled with naked men of all ages flinging their chuối and 2 quả chôm chôm. are these places legal to operate in Vietnam? Any raider by police?

 The daughter has become tremendously successful by every metric (has her own e-commerce business, active social life, makes 6 figures) but her mom keeps trying to guilt about how she could die any minute (either from poor health or suicide) and that it’s her “duty” to live with her mom.
 This is the same woman that forced her then 18 year old daughter to sleep in the same bed with her every night to prevent her from masturbating. When I ask my other relatives what they think they actually side with the mom and say the most important thing in life is being near family and this idea of “independence” and “adventure” is pointless and irresponsible. Lol
 Thoughts?

It seems like a direct flight isn't an option, and the layovers could take up to 12 hours.
 Could anyone here help me out by suggesting a more efficient route or sharing any local insights? I'd really appreciate your input!

 What else comes up are: Insurance, communication, mobility, loan repayments, etc. In the end, I'm left with about 10% of my net income per month to save, so not much either. You don't get rich that way. How does it look in Vietnam?

 What would a foreigner expect to be paid in Vietnam working in tech?
 I'm aware there can be a big divide between what companies pay locals vs foreigners (such as pilots). I'm wondering if this is the same in the tech world, I have a Vietnamese partner and would like to move there at some point - but looking at the job adverts on indeed etc. and the salaries are tiny in comparison to where I am now (UK). Obviously the living cost in Vietnam is equally a lot less than UK but even so getting a nice apartment in Hanoi or Saigon could be comparative to some UK house prices.
 I'm a network engineer btw.

 But recently I noticed people use the cup and then place them directly back into the bowl. It doesnt appear as though the shop washed them before the next customer grabbed it and used it.
 And ive noticed this at multiple shops now. Is this a thing in vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a 98-er graduated University since 2020. As you guess it: Covid (2020) - Lockdown (2021) - Economic recession (2022-now). 
 Me and my friends at around the same age have been seriously struggling to find decent jobs since the beginning of 2023. I thought I was lucky to find a job at a tech company with an "ok" salary (1000usd gross). Turned out the company is exploitative and management is extremely toxic and abusive. So back to the grind to find a job for the last couple of months. 
 Why are companies trying to tell us Gen Zs as unstable and indecisive in our careers when in reality, we're (or most friends I know) just trying so hard to find a DECENT job where we can stick around for stability without being exploited to the point of mentally suffering to get by?
 Some recruiters even told me that my salary expectation was too high :) My expectation is 20-25M net/month?? Mind you, I have 4 years of experience, fluent at English and graduated from a top university in Aus. I know it largely depends on the job, industries... but it's affected my self-esteem somewhat. 
 If you're a young native Vnese are you going through the same thing?
 If not, please teach me how to sniff out the bad companies and find ones that pay you you're worth?? Open to discuss further
 Edit: I live in HCM, the most expensive city in this country so my expected salary is just enough for me to pay rent, groceries, have very fundamental household needs fulfilled and left with around 2-3mil extra to save. I dont think its too much to ask..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved to Vietnam this year about six months ago. Almost right on cue, I started to have stomach problems, mainly in the form of diarrhea. Curiously, aside from two particularly awful days, it rarely manifests as outright food poisoning where it affects me the whole day. Rather I'll get "you have 30 seconds to comply" situations. Cafe sua especially has a tendency to cause this roughly 1/4 of the time, so I just avoid it now.
 If I cook at home or eat more expensive foreign cuisine like Korean or Japanese food, the problem alleviates and my bowels actually become normal. However, if I go out to eat Vietnamese food (even at busy restaurants with high turnover) or drink cafe coffee (including even some supposedly safe looking coffee shops like Cafe Amazon), it's only a matter of time before things rear their ugly head again. Most of the time, I'll be fine, but I feel like a bout or two of diarrhea (but not out and out food poisoning, I never throw up or feel nauseous) every two weeks isn't normal. It feels like a shame to not feel comfortable eating the local food due to these issues. 
 I have never had these issues before, and the timing from my arrival here (as well as its alleviation when i switch to home cooking only) is quite conspicuous. From what I hear, travelers diarrhea is supposed to resolve within a few weeks, not six months. Has anyone else experienced these issues? Is my stomach just not built for here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently there was a video of a teacher bullying a student. The reason is because that student didn't buy desserts from the bakery the teacher told her to buy. And then later the headmaster of that school wants to punish the student who upload the video. They are trying to cover their wrong doing and warn others not to publish the evidence to save the school's face. 
 Vụ này ở VN mấy ngày nay nổi rầm rầm chắc ai cũng biết. Vấn đề là mình cảm thấy những vụ liên quan đến bạo lực học đường, dù là do giáo viên hay học sinh bắt nạt lẫn nhau, đều bị nhà trường hoặc cố giấu nhẹm hoặc là lờ đi không hề nhắc đến, có vụ nữ sinh tự tử do bị bắt nạt quá đà mà nhà trường biết nhưng cố tình ép nữ sinh đi học để bị bắt nạt tiếp, trong khi đó không hề đứng ra xử lý gì việc bắt nạt. 
 Cái này rõ ràng ai sống ở VN đều biết là để giữ điểm thành tích, thanh danh cho nhà trường. 
 Nghĩ ai còn đang đi học với ai có con cái còn đi học sẽ thấy thế nào, hoặc là bị bắt nạt rồi đến mức phải chuyển trường, thành vết sẹo tâm lý, trong khi đó không ai bênh vực cả. Nếu ko có những clip bằng chứng như vậy ai sẽ biết đến vụ việc bị bắt nạt? Mà giờ còn phạt cả những ai dám nói, dám đưa clip lên nữa.
 Các bạn nghĩ sao về vụ này?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here I will answer how to get the vat refund. When you buy any item in Vietnam. Costly items like electronics, phone, camera etx. The shop needs to fill up the customs declaration form. It will mention your passport details. Entry exit date, expiry date etc. You can claim the vat refund only if you are on a tourist visa, exiting the country. At the airport, you need to go to the customs office. At Hanoi airportz it's little tricky. The security, police don't understand English. I asked 4 people. They could not answer. Information desk could not explain me even after I showed the translator. Eventually I found out the customs office. 
 I presented the customs declaration form to the officer. He took 2-3 minutes to verify it and forwarded to a clerk of MSB bank who was sitting at the next counter. She asked me to sign couple of forms. Then provided me 85% of the total vat. She paid me in cash USD. Entire process took 10 minutes. That's all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got a new job that requires 1hr commute each way on a motorbike during peak hours, and on terrible roads. I'm considering buying a new motorbike that is:
  
Comfortable on long ride and bumpy road
 It doesn't have to be super fast, but it needs to have good acceleration from dead stop because that would make life easier when I'm stuck in traffic jam
 Decent storage space because I need to keep a spare helmet + my bag and other stuff
 Is not too short. I was considering Leads but as a 6'0 guy, my legs are bent too much riding a Leads
 Not too expensive like SH

 I was texting my dad and he kept referring Buddha as a god. I personally don't practice any religions. But from what I read, there isn't a god in buddism? That got me thinking, is it practiced differently in Vietnam than in the US?
 He was texting me that whether or I was born with one arm, wheel chair bound, or gay, that he still loves me because I was Buddha god gift to him?
 Edit. Sorry did not mean to god gift. His exact words were "god give ba boy or girl or gay ba love all".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this kind of question has already been asked. I’ve lived in Vietnam for 7 years and tried my fair share of dishes.. some of my favorites being bún riêu, chả cá, bún chả, cơm sườn, cơm rang dưa bò, and pho cuốn. I used to write about food and honestly if it’s a popular dish I’ve probably tried it! 
 Im curious to try some more niche dishes - things you don’t see every day. Perhaps specialities from remote areas. Something like cơm hến in Huế, for example. 
 Let me know some of your gems 💎 thanks.

 I'll be staying in Danang for the first few days and have a day trip planned to Hoi A on a weekday. My plan is to use Grab for a cab ride back to Danang at night. I'm seeking advice on the optimal departure time from Hoi An at night, wondering when Grab taxi services typically stop operating in the area.
 The intent is to maximise night time at Hoi An because I have heard the city is very charming at night but I can’t stay in Hoi an and have to come back to Danang at night.
 Additionally, I'd like to know if traveling at night in this route is considered safe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I was job hunting, and this company (they claimed they're Vissan which is a decently big Food product company in Vietnam) contacted me. They sent an email for a physical interview that is set for this weekend, in the meanwhile they did this "online prequalification" that has to go through Telegram.
 The first part of this bullcrap is an MBTI test(?) that contains only like 5 questions. Am I that out of touched to the HR world that MBTI is a standard thing now?
 The second part is the relatively well-known scam that has been floating around recently, which is inputting data and get money from a lottery platform, all in the guys of "making extra revenue". First they sent me 150k to add to the platform, so I played along for a bit, got 330k in return. They seems to be impressed that they started telling me about the 4 tiers of data entry, which basically is an ever increasing amount of money in return for a (supposedly) even higher amount. Of course that first run was a trial period, the 2nd run will be a 40-60 shares of profit for the company. And on top of it, the lowest tier they put up is 600k, which is just above the amount that I just earned, which means I have to pour money out of my own pocket for them.
 Here's where I cut things off. This is too many red flags with screaming horns in my head. No fucking way a company would take money from their applicants. The funniest thing is that they even have the audacity to breath out that sentence I screenshotted above. I guess taking 330k from them is not much but it still filled my pettiness with something close to pride.
 So tl;dr: I have an encounter with a scam group that masquerading as a legit company. Took some money from them instead.

 I have plan to come to vietnam second time. i want to cook some korean food for bf extended family. My favorite one is Gopchang (grilled pork and beef intestines)
 I asked bf, but he said it’s not popular. I guess he just wants me to persuade me to cook another dishes, because he can not eat intestines 😚😙😗
 If you guys eat intestines, what is your favorite type of cooking? In Korea, we often do barbecue (grill). Are there any Korean dishes, which Vietnamese people love? I’m willing to learn and cook for them
 Last time, I asked “how to impress viet parents” in this sub. Your suggestions helped me a lot, and I was successful. Thank you 🙏 🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This goes back by about five generations at least but does anyone else have stories of relatives who were sent to Reunion Island due to French slaver trade or know more about the history of that place and era around 1600-1700?
 I'm not interested in raising animosities but would like to learn more about the era and see if others are searching or have their own family stories from the era as there's word from a grandparent's grandparent that some relatives were captured and sent there. 
 Are there any Vietnamese memorials, communities in Reunion Island or organizations dedicated to those who were stolen as a result?

 My name’s Dom and I’m part of an all asian theater collective based in Montreal! 
 We are travelling to Vietnam to do research for our next show. We will be in Hanoi from October 24 to 29 and Saigon from 29 to the 2!
 I was wondering if you guys had any theater plays or concerts we could go to while we are there!
 I’ve looked at the productions at the Saigon Opera House but, we’re looking for something a bit more contemporary/avant-garde if that’s possible! 
 Anyways, if you have any artistic recommandations (contemporary danse shows, art museums, alternative music, great coffee shops, librairies,etc..) or are an artist in Vietnam, it would be amazing to connect! 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question might be silly but I’m just curious. I’m watching Young Sheldon (the series is set in Medford, Texas in the 80s-90s btw), and Sheldon has a Vietnamese friend named Tam. His mom always packs dimsum for him, to the point he’s sick of it.
 Dimsum is generally a Chinese food. I know we have dimsum here too but it’s still thought of as a Chinese food, or đồ Hoa.
 So my question is, do Vietnamese Americans have dim sum for lunch that often too? Or is it just another case of filmmakers/showrunners mixing up Asian people and following stereotypes?
 Again, this is just me contemplating about things in life. No big deal either way. So let me know your perspective. Thank you.

 Im coming to Vietnam, to Ho Chi Minh 11th October, and I'm really confused. We have 11 days available and we returning to the same airport. My question is: What to do there? :) I had a lot of work before holiday and I couldn't prepare for this. Im starting now :) 
 I was wondering about rental motorbike, but im not sure cause im going with my girlfriend and we have 2 big backpacks. What do you think guys?
 And im looking for something special, im not big fan of architecture, rather we prefer local experience and nature. I don't like the crowds too, but I know that's normal in big cities and popular attractions. 
 ​
 In short - can you give us some hidden gems? And what do you think about rental 2 bikes ( My GF is driver too) and traveling from Ho Chi Minh to Hoi An. Or maybe we should take a plane and rent bikes there? And last but not least - weather. Im a little nervous when I see a forecast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As per title, recently those type of questions pop up rather frequently in this sub to the point I find it unreasonable. 
 The more of those questions pop up and the more I read into it, the less I see it is related to the Vietnamese country/ the culture/ the people.
 It might only have to do with that particular, very specific family/ relationship/ situation being in question. Regardless the whole nation is called into question for some behavior.
 You guys do know that Vietnam is a country of over 100m population, with polarized income and living conditions, plus having worldwide diasporas (in North America, Australia, European continent, African continent, East Asia, the Middle East) so finding an average Nguyen is nigh impossible, right???
 Instead of asking “Why my Vietnamese relative treat me like shit?” or “Why Vietnamese male drink coffee all morning and doesn’t go to work?” People can rephrase it such as “why my relative treat me like shit?” - does the fact that they are Vietnamese or Vietnamese immigrants play any roles in the question?

Initially, my father didn't want any part of me when my mother got pregnant because I was an accident. He impregnated my mom when he was 25, and she was 15. Before I was born, he tried to persuade my mom to have an abortion. I met him for the first time at the age of 5 and then reconnected with the family at the age of 12. My stepmom is mostly the reason why I wasn't around, as my father lied to her and never disclosed my existence until my mom basically gave him an ultimatum to accept me as his son. If he didn't, she would take him to court for child support, which she did, and he paid until I turned 18. My stepmom is also the reason I re-entered the family …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a woman born in Europe and my parents are Vietnamese.
 My father teaches me that it’s a woman’s job to take care of the household and the kids. Meanwhile he expects me to do a master’s degree and work full time as well. He teaches me things like: - It’s fine for men to have a high body count before marriage but girls should keep themselves pure - It’s a woman’s job to do the cooking, cleaning, etc. (including things like having to cut my husband’s finger and toe nails) - I shouldn’t do a doctor’s degree because men are deterred from women with higher education - It’s justified if my husband cheats if I don’t provide him with a warm meal and children
 My mother works full time as well but he feels entitled to everything she does for him. If there’s no food or the food is too salty for example, he starts to shout and says “without me, you would be living in the streets.”
 Is that normal for our Vietnamese culture? I’ve never seen him grateful for how we support him.

 My best friend and I haven't seen each other for years (we live in different countries now) and we're thinking of travelling and reuniting in Vietnam. 
 We both would like to indulge ourselves in Vietnam's food and culture. We both enjoy long walks, have some drinks, and trying out some things new! (something more "local" and maybe not too touristy haha)
 Any recommendations and suggestions are highly appreciated. Thank you! :)

Looking at a lot of reddit posts I'll probably bring some sandals (maybe Columbia Breaksiders?) for light walks and water activities but I will also go to Sa Pa and other places where I would like to hike. Since the weather won't be as hot as in the summer, do you guys think some light hiking boots would be a good idea as a second pair and if so do you have any suggestions (I looked at the Merrell Nova 3 Mid for example)? I like hiking shoes that go over your ankles to prevent injuries on rugged terrain.
 Thank you guys in advance!

 After reading that it’s not uncommon for foreign bank cards to not work at some ATMs, I laced up my walking shoes and tried literally 17 ATMs, all unsuccessfully. I always tried 2 mil, I tried adding money to my USD wallet, I tried walking to the CitiBank atm, nothing. Eventually I went to the Wise website to see if something was locked with my card and I stumbled on a support page that listed countries that US accounts won’t work in. 
 I have a card from my US bank so I’ll probably just take the fee on the chin or consider using the Western Union app to send myself some money in the morning.

 I have a plan to come back to my country and work there for a long time. I asked my gf, and she agreed to relocate with me. We’ll move to vn in February next year. I am happy she’s willing to follow me. But I’m worried that she may struggle to adapt to living and workenvironment in Vietnam.
 As a foreigner living vn, what were your difficulties in living and working? Esp female foreigners (female and male may have different concerns). How did you overcome them?
 What can I do to help her go through tough time? She doesn’t need to worry about money, living place. We only care how she can get a good job, have positive experience and avoid being culture shocked or anxious
 She wants to learn the language. Can you suggest any language centers or tutors teaching foreigners Vietnamese?
 Any Vietnamese or foreigner having the same situation here, can you share your experience? I appreciate all your suggestions!!!!
 You may wonder why I don’t stay in Canada. I actually got PR of Canada. I am working for an American firm. The company is building a new factory in a north province of vietnam. I was chosen to work as one of managers in that factory, because I can speak the language. I will work in my home country like “expat” 😂😂. This is also a good chance for me to make a big chunk of money.😁

 Any usual pitfalls/quirks about landlords and realtors? Should something be explicitly checked for and settled at the contract stage? Are large deposits and commissions common?
 Any info from your experience would be of a great help :)
 I will be most likely settling in District 7, since thats where my office will be, and hearing that its a lot more spacious, green and unconjested compared to the center districts.

 A few stops on this hypothetical trip will be Philippines, Japan and Vietnam.
 Never been to Asia, no clue what to expect. 
 Are there many digital nomads working abroad in this fashion? Are foreigners generally well regarded?
 Where are some common or recommended areas to do something like this?
 Forgive my ignorance, thought I’d post here to get some general feedback.

 Since I'm from the EU, I had no idea how it worked elsewhere, but it's just common sense in the EU to not stay constantly in the left lane unless I'm passing someone else. I believe in some countries you can get even fined if you occupy the left lane for no reason 
 Do you believe a culture of left lane for passing only can be adopted here? Or is it too late now to create such culture? (talking about the highways reserved for cars only, not the normal roads)

I love Vietnamese food (Banh Mi, soups and salads) and excited to try authentic fare as well as experience the culture. Some of my questions and concerns needing answers from travelers who have been there: -Visa. I believe visitors will need a visa to enter. Could anyone share the link to apply for the visa application? Can it be an online application, how much and how long to get the visa. -Money to get around. Are credit cards accepted or only cash? -Wifi access. Would getting a local SIM to access the internet be the best way? Do the Vietnamese telcos offer inexpensive prepaid SIMs and roughly how much? -Must sees and do's in Ho Chi Minh. Recommended places of interest to see and unique experiences would be great. -Souvenirs. What's good to bring home from Vietnam? I would appreciate your practical tips and suggestions. Thanks in advance.

 As the title says, I got an offer from ILA for Can Tho! On the surface, things sound pretty decent, especially since they offer a housing allowance. 
 My pay according to the contract (before taxes) is 473,000 VND an hour (20 teaching hours a week), on top of a housing allowance of 7,000,000 VND per month. It's a standard 12-month contract. 
 My main priorities are to learn how to be a good teacher, save as much as I can, and try to avoid stress as much as possible. That being said, I want to make sure ILA is a good fit for me. I don't mind the region I'm staying in (Can Tho) since I doubt I'm gonna leave my apartment much... for me, the priority is just learning a local culture and saving money. 
 Does anyone have any experiences with ILA that they'd be willing to share? I understand that avoiding stress is impossible as a teacher, but I just want to make sure that they've got a good support system in place. The last thing I want is to be overworked or overwhelmed with stuff that they didn't mention in the interview or the contract... only to realize I could've had that same experience here, in the states. 
 Long story shrot, this is the only offer I think I'll be getting from Vietnam... and I'm stuck between taking it and just giving up and sticking to living in the states. I don't want to go overseas and get burned out on teaching since I'm gonna be doing that for a living... 
 Please let me know, thank you.

(which i didn't make). To be honest i think they got a hold of my credit card information and now i have to dispute this. I just thought i'd share this so please be careful and aware everybody. 
 It's in D1 , and the credit card dispute team can't help me right now at the moment because of the time zone differences so I'll have to wait until night time to settle this . 
 This really sucks, but i would share this because I wouldn't want anybody to deal with a situation like this, especially overseas.

 6 women, including 4 Vietnamese, were rescued by French police in the back of a refrigerated truck after sending a text message asking for help.
 French police announced that they stopped a refrigerated truck on September 27 on the E15 highway near Drace, north of Lyon and discovered 6 women, including 4 Vietnamese and two Iraqis, in the cramped trunk full of bananas. BBC reported on September 28.
 Laetitia Francart, prosecutor of the Villefranche-sur-Saone region, north of the city of Lyon, eastern France, said the group of women got into the back of a truck with Irish license plates hoping to reach Britain or Ireland.

They usually watch reruns when it is on and always laugh and enjoy it, but when I ask them about actually going to see it live they seem indifferent.
 Are older Vietnamese parents actually into PBN and secretly would love to go? Or do they not really care for the program all too much?

 I would like to start with my first experience with this issue. After I finished with my university, I got hired into a Vietnamese branch of a Japanese self-driving car start up. Things were fine back then except for one thing. My CEO. He was a total Japanese-supremacy guy (He is Vietnamese, btw). One day, me and my senior had to work overtime to fix some issues that the our Japanese colleagues made. It was a mismanagement problem, so while we were okay with working overtime to fix it, we thought it would be more productive to raise this problem in the next meeting…]]></summary>

 Thoạt đầu tưởng rằng chỉ là trò bịp bợm của ai đó trên mạng nhưng hóa ra không phải. Khi thấy điểm bất ngờ nên tôi đã nghiên cứu qua thử thì thấy có rất nhiều điểm đáng để nói trong vụ án lần này.
 Trước khi tới tình tiết phân tích chuyên sâu, nếu ai đã đọc quyển sách Đêm trường tăm tối của Tử Kim Trần thì sẽ thấy sự giống y hệt xã hội chúng ta đang sống hiện tại. Càng đọc, càng thấy sự na ná và tôi mong nếu bạn đang đọc đến dòng này, thì hãy đọc tiếp vì bạn sẽ cảm thấy bất ngờ.

 What are the realistic job opportunities in HCMC and/or Hanoi for someone who speaks neither English nor Vietnamese? More specifically, for someone who speaks Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese (has Italian and Brazilian citizenship), and who has work experience in programming, IT, and graphic design, and also has "uncertified" skills in construction and furniture building? 
 I know that being a Digital Nomad or working remotely for a European country are obvious answers, but I'm wondering about on-the-ground, potentially Visa-sponsored gigs? I do not yet live in Vietnam, so when I search on my Dell from the USA, even if I search in Spanish (my second language), my results are highly skewed and unhelpful.
 If anyone has links, knows of good recruiting companies, or anything, I'd greatly appreciate it! Equally, if the answer is that my friend would be SOL, thank you for the frankness 😅

I think the standard rule (if there is such a thing), is to use the same address (anh, chi, em) based on one's own sibling's age. But what about if the husband or wife of your sibling is younger than you? In most traditions, you still follow the "standard rules", but I've met people who address the younger (in age) sibling-in-law as "chu, cau, co, di", as though they were addressing them in place of their children. What tradition do you follow, dear Redditors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a brother. My dad mentioned him once when I was young, didn’t bring him up for years, then finally told me about him again and confirmed it wasn’t a fever dream. 
 My brother would be in his mid to late thirties. My dad was half white and was kicked out of the hospital by my brother’s grandma. He wasn’t allowed to see his son after that. My dad eventually made it to America but has always missed my brother. My grandma did not know of my brother because he was born out of wedlock. I accidentally let it slip. 
 I’m contemplating doing a DNA test and potentially finding him. I want to do an American one as well since my grandpa (my dads father) was a lieutenant during the war. Though, I do want to meet my brother the most. To let him know my dad didn’t willingly abandon him. Have them meet. Help my grandma meet her first grandchild as she always thought I was the first. 
 If anyone has any insight, that’ll be extremely helpful. Thank you.
 Edit: when I ask, “do people in Vietnam do these tests” it’s because I’m asking if it’s commonplace and if it’s as popular in other countries. I want to see if there is any percentage of a chance it’ll work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In your opinion, other than the An Thuong area, what is a desirable neighorhood(s) in Danang for locals?
 An Nhon (near Korea town) seems pretty nice. Also the area near the Foreign Language University.
 But i have a hunch that I havnt really found the desirable, nice Danang neighborhood yet. Any tips where I can look?

 That said, I have one major point of complaint: the state of infrastructure - in particular - transport infrastructure - in the country, is totally unacceptable. 
 Now I know Vietnam is still a relatively poor country, and is still significantly behind the likes of Thailand or Malaysia in economic development (although it is progressing rapidly). But even for a country at its income level (real per capita GDP of $15k), it’s still not good enough. And fixing it will be crucial if Vietnam is to have sustainable long run economic success and capitalise on current investment…]]></summary>

 For context: I broke up with my ex over 3 years ago and we haven’t talked ever since. It was a peaceful, face-to-face breakup. When we were together she made an IG for me bc I didn’t use IG (she only posted fluffy lovey dovey stuff of us there, I didn’t have access to it). I have been together with my current gf for almost 2 years. 
 For the main story, I was using my gf’s phone and while on her app switcher screen, I saw she was browsing my ex-made instagram account on Zalo browser. I got startled and immediately went to the Zalo app to see how she came across it. 
 Apparently “I” was the one who sent it to her on Zal…]]></summary>

Are lotto ticket sellers basically verified as poor and are given those tickets by the government to sell? They only get a commission per ticket so it's better for them if I just give them the cash and let them keep the ticket?
 I've also been told to avoid giving money to women carrying drugged babies and children selling stuff, particularly around Bui Vien they are owned by mafia and don't get to keep the money themselves/ aren't allowed go to school.
 Correct me if I'm wrong with anything as I'm only going off what I'm told.

 I'm a pretty experienced motorbike driver, but before wandering to this side of the world, I did not ask for my international driving permit. I do have valid national driving license for motorcycles of all cc, but legally that is worthless in Vietnam.
 My question is simple: how risky is it if I try to do the Ha Chiang Loop on my own, without an IDP? Are there mandatory checks somewhere? Are they somehow skippable?
 I understand that this is at all NOT recommended, but desperate times call for desperate means. And driving experience is not an issue, really.
 I'm eager to hear your experience, but I guess it's more valuable if you didn't take a big group tour. I'd really prefer doing this on my own.
 Cheers and happy travels!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, due to multiple issues( weak health, financial burden, etc) I decided to take break for a year and today was the first day I started going to college. However, after a whole day of studying I felt drained? And I have a feeling that applying to college was a huge mistake or something. I'm think about withdrawing my college tuition fees if this keeps going on in the future.
 I applied to the Diplomatic Acedamy of Vietnam(DAV) by the way. Was it because I took a break for so long that I've grown accustomed to being lazy all day? Or was it something else? DAV is famous for having cut-throat competitive environment so maybe that's why? I felt totally intimidated by the environment. Maybe it was a huge mistake applying here. Deep down I have always had the desire to run away from society and become a hermit or a beggar so that I can get this mental turmoil off my head.
 I know some of you might think that I am being childish or immature but really, it got so bad that I quitted everything for a whole year and stayed at home doing nothing but house chores and walking around the neighborhood. Honestly I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me anymore. I am thinking of using my remaining savings to... run away somewhere before... committing suicide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm looking to travel to Vietnam for a 2 week vacation starting in the middle of November. I will be travelling solo, Male 38.
 I like a mix of things when travelling, the most important being: Local food and culture, nightlife (bars), local sporting events, beaches, cultural history, and potentially bringing my golf clubs. I've been looking at staying in Hanoi for a week and then heading to Ha Long Bay.
 I've also been reading about starting in HCMC and making my way up through Da Nang/Hoi An. I'm not huge into spending days travelling, so was wonder if people have input on HCMC and surrounding areas vs Hanio and surrounding?

There don’t appear to be any rules, not sure why an effort was even made to paint lanes, and traffic lights are simply a suggestion. In spite of all of this, everyone seems to navigate the roads in a chaotic harmony. After the initial terror of crossing a street, my wife has embraced the chaos and now takes joy in pointing out the motorbike with six kegs on it or the man somehow carrying an entire workshop on his back. 
 Vietnam is amazing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Or are you not allowed to?
 Last week my dad got hospitalized due to suspision of streptococcus suis contraction. Still to today they havent (or dont) tell him if he actually has it or not or what he actually has regardless of his repeated inquiries and their repeated blood tests.
 Same story early this year, at a different hospital. My mom got a "heart situation" and we called for an ambulance. On the way to the hospital the ER people said it was a myocardial infarction (heart attack). However, the doctorS (stress on plural cause multiple of them reviewed her case and i saw it) said they "dont think" that's the case. They suspect it to be a heart failure, "maybe" caused by either hypotension or hypoglycemia. Thats about everything they ever said during an entire week she was there.
 Well, here I am half a year later and still have no clue what actually happened to my mother and how i could prevent it from happening again. Cause they dont tell me or her or my dad. They just said dont worry rest well blah blah. They dont even give us the medical record, just a prescription paper in which it said thats the illness were "related to coronary artery disease and other types of diabetes".
 So why cant you tell us whats wrong with us? You cant or you're not allowed to? Is it a personal thing or a professional thing? Is it a public vs private hospital thing? Or you cant be bothered to talk to us cause you're too busy?
 PS: please people in the comments, im really concerned about my parents and them keep being kept in the dark. Im not trying to be smart or condescending or presumptious. If you live in HCMC and know a hospital with high quality transparant service, do tell me.
 Tldr: my parents have been hospitalized on 2 seperate occasions and nobody ever told them what they actually have.

 Just that I didn't want to pack these things while coming and increase my luggage resulting in paying extra airline charges. I would be in your debt if there's some suggestion on this.
 So basically, I want to buy a jacket in Vietnam, use it and then sell it back in Vietnam itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so i am having my first solo travel in November.
 At the moment I scheduled 25 days in Vietnam. However from viewing different itineraries and youtube videos I was kina turned off by south Vietnam.
 My main priorities are breathtaking nature and sporty/extreme activities, like ziplines, surfing, diving.
 I don't care for big cities ,cultural tours, partying and craftsmentship workshops (which i heared there are a lot of in Hoi-an). Originally I was planning to go with my girlfriend, and these activities are fun as a couple, but I just don't think I will enjoy them as a solo traveler.
 I have read that north Vietnam's nature is amazing and compared to it South Vietnam is underwhelming and has more of the content that i am less inclined towards.
 Therefore I am considering the option of doing about 2 weeks in North Vietnam, focusing on the Loop, The caves, Sapa etc, and then transfering for a short diving/surfing vacation in the phillipins(which excites me but I was originally fine to give up to travel with my ex-gf) . I thought about Thailand as well but i had been there a few years ago. I might be able to add a few days to a week to my trip for that.
 I would love to hear about if someone thinks the plan is feasible / change my mind regarding south Vietnam/ present another option (Cambodia?)
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I will be traveling to Vietnam in November and I will mostly stay in the North of Vietnam (Ha Giang, Sapa, Ha Long Bay, Ninh Binh) where the weather will be nice. I love outdoor stuff like hiking and trekking and therefore I would love to visit Phong Nha Ke Bang national park (it looks absolutely stunning!) and do an overnight trekking tour there. However, it seems that the national park is located in central Vietnam where November is part of the raining season. As a result Oxalis is not offering a lot of tours but I found another organization (Jungle Boss) that is offering several tours, even in caves. 
 I’ve been trying to find out how bad it really is in November based on the experiences of other travelers and information on websites, but I’m getting lots of contradictory results. Is it a 100% chance of rain every day and should I be expecting rain all day long? Or should I expect some short (but intense) showers every day and is there also chance to see some sun? 
 Also, when I look up temperatures most websites mention temperatures between 66°F (19°C) to 75°F (24°C), however, on other websites I read that it can get unbearably cold during the night. It’s very confusing as I would not describe 20 degrees Celsius as unbearably cold. 
 I know it would be best to come back to Vietnam for the central part another time, but I don’t think I’ll be back in Vietnam soon as there are so many other places on my travel bucket list as well. And I also know that the weather can’t be predicted but it would be great to hear at least some real experiences from other travelers in November. Not just in Ke Bang national park but experiences from central Vietnam in general will be appreciated.
 (My native language is not English, sorry for any misspelling)

 How does the burning season (in N Thailand/Chiang Mai and other parts of SEA) affect Vietnam and Cambodia? I was seeing some pictures of Halong Bay from this past April and it looks super hazy, the skies aren’t blue, which got me wondering. I would like to have good visibility especially for the traveling and cruise and our time in Ninh Binh and Angkor Wat especially. Would love any feedback or thoughts or even a better time to go (I haven’t booked flights yet). Was thinking about pushing it to May but May looks so hot!
 Thank you!!!

This move would occur 6 days after check-in. He offered us a day's price of the condotel rental to compensate. We obliged, and they offered to help us transport our luggage from the old unit to the next unit if we weren't available to move it. We agreed as we had arrangements for a tour on the moving day which meant we would not be present for the transfer. 
 After the move occurred and we returned to the building, we discovered some of the contents of our luggage missing including clothing, computer equipment, a cell phone, and cash. We didn't ta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something I've noticed is sharing is HUGE in Vietnamese culture. At first I didn't realize why every time I had tortilla chips in the back of the shop, they would always get eaten by the end of the business day. Nobody would ask me to eat my snacks/dinners/etc. This never bugged me but it did always cross my mind when I would go to take my food home and there was no food left! It now appears to me, having been to a recent work banquet, where my co-workers grabbed several smaller bowls and placed different variations of their pho and egg noodles for me to taste. And it doesn't stop there, they always offer me to try new things. From desserts with potato to different variations of noodles. I'm happy to be here, what can I do to express my gratitude?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I traveled to Vietnam and only went to Hue/Hoi An/Da nang. 
 They are all very good cities in central Vietnam. My favorite is Da nang! When you go to Hue, you can see the ancient Hue Imperial City and the famous Temple. You can walk by the river during the day and go to nearby bars to drink and listen to songs at night. It is a very pleasant life.
 The day and night in Hoi An Ancient Town are particularly attractive. Walk around the ancient town during the day, go to a nearby coffee shop for a cup of coffee and some cake. You can also go to the riverside at night, and both sides are very beautiful! There are many famous restaurants nearby! My favorite coffee shop is Mia Coffee. Their cakes are very delicious and the coffee is also great. It should be reminded that Hoi An's consumption is higher than that of Hue and even in Da nang, which may be due to tourist cities! What you get with the same money is not worth it! But this is the reason why it is a tourist city. It should be noted that there are some stores that do not indicate the price, and the boss may overpay tourists!
 I mainly went to Monkey Mountain and the Pink Church in Da nang, as well as the Cham Sculpture Museum. If you are interested in Cham culture, you can go and have a look! Very good! You can also go to the holy places of Meishan, which are some historical relics of Hinduism. The night in Da nang is beautiful! There are many lively bars where you can go for a drink. However, I ended up spending time at the Hilton Hotel in Da nang. During the day, I also went to the beach for a drink, ate some snacks, and lay on the beach chair to read. It was very comfortably. The executive lounge of the Hilton Hotel is also very good! You can eat very delicious food at 6 p.m.! There are also bartenders to drink! The staff is great!

 Any recommendations where I should stay?
 I like beaches but don’t want a boring or very touristic neighborhood. Somewhere where I can go to gym, cafes, socialize, work a bit and then go to the beach maybe 20-30 minutes away from home.
 I do not mind a warm rain but I don’t want to end up in the most rainy location. I read that rainy season starts in some areas in November.
 Not a party person but I would prefer an active neighborhood where I can meet new people. 
 Thanks

I happen to fall into that category perfectly, and I was considering planning a 2 week trip to go sightseeing next year.
 Is the attitude hostile at all, or will people generally be welcoming while I travel? I’ve never been to Vietnam before, so will be good to know what to expect.

 I'll be honest that I'm not sure what much of it was, but I do know that it contained: shrimp, rice noodles, pork belly, and chilli stuffed with mackerel, something crunchy yet chewy, and also two other types of seafood I can't identify. 
 I also have no idea what anything in the other bowls are, but they tasted very refreshing - especially with this lovely green bowl of sauce they bought over shortly after.
 I highly recommend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: I genuinely love kids. I don't mean to offend anyone by judging the children, but I'd like to hear your opinion.
 I usually visit certain coffee shops on the weekends to find new inspiration and refresh my mind. I tend to be more creative in such places. Lately, I've been frequenting The Coffee House due to its spacious and comfortable ambiance for working. However, I've encountered some issues with families that bring their children, typically around 3 to 5 years old. These kids never sit still, always yelling and running around without much supervision from their parents. Moreover, the parents in these families tend to speak loudly, trying to overcome the noise created by their children, and sometimes they reprimand their children when they glance at the kids attempting to break something. This results in a significant amount of chaos, which can be quite anxious. It feels more like a kindergarten than a place for adults.
 I want to emphasize once again that I'm not passing judgment on the children or their parents. However, from my perspective, it appears that the awareness of some individuals nowadays is somewhat lacking, and this could potentially have a negative impact on their children's behavior and attitudes (It is actually occurring now)
 Peace.

 I experience these requests repeatedly "cancel, help me", while the app might say "you will wait for drivers longer now, because you cancel the rides". Plus any bonus applied to the ride might not be applied the second time.

 I'd like to encourage all good and groovy people to attend for fun and support of all the song artists that will be attending. 
 Plus, I'd like to offer ₫100k to the first 10 people to get a selfie with the 1pm dinner after her performance. Just DM me with the pic, and if it's her, then I'll write the money over.
 Cheers!

 Does this happen to anyone else often? How do you handle it? 
 The first time, I said sure (with family members of my partner). It turned into a multiple hour feast and drink till you pass out on the karaoke mic. The only strange part was no common language the entire time. 
 For this, is why I usually try to turn this opportunity down even though i feel so bad for doing so. I’m all for being invited to have some food, but drinking gets crazy with the Vietnamese haha.

Ms. Ann An Phuong Nguyen (formerly known as Ann Cusack), a teacher in Australia, was just 20 years old at the time. She followed her conscience, leaving her hometown, family and prosperous life. to go to refugee camps to help Vietnamese refugees who have just escaped the country. During 7 consecutive years of volunteer service, she took care of many refugee children and taught English in refugee camps in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. During VHM's Gala program on Sunday, September 17, 2023, the Vietnamese Heritage Museum (VHM) was honored to present Ms. Ann Cusack with the VHM Humanitarian Award, as a special way to respectfully acknowledge her love. Her personal love was demonstrated by her tireless and dedicated service to many Boat People during her years of service in Southeast Asian refugee camps.

I'm not talking about the small family business though - I've seen that in good hotels, restaurants, etc. I've seen workers working during the day and then going to sleep on the business' basement or on the building's last floor. I've accidentally even gone to the basement of some of these hotels and seen someone living there with a kitchen everything.
 Is this common practice? If yes, why? And is it legal?

 I’ve been lucky enough to learn how to play the đàn nguyệt and be exposed to different styles of traditional Vietnamese music. My favorite by far is nhạc cung đình Huế and ca Huế. I’ll never get over how Lưu thủy kim tiền flows or the swaying of Nữ sinh đồng Khánh (I know this is more recent) set to the accompaniment of traditional instruments.
 I really like profiles like this one and it’d be nice to be more exposed to creators that highlight more diverse perspectives on our culture.

 However, I also plan to take advantage of the opportunity to experience Vietnamese culture, including the communist/socialist culture.
 Is it permitted to openly display communist/socialist culture in Vietnam? By communist/socialist culture, I mean an overt display of icons connected to communism. For example, am I allowed to wear the military cap with a red star? Am I allowed to pose with Ho Chi Minh's monument with my left fist raised?

But instead of going the traditional route of marrying heterosexual, or partnering with a lesbian couple, I wanna do the better thing of adopting a child. 
 Heck, even if I'm heterosexual I would still choose to adopt a child. There's a lot of children needing a home, if you want a child just adopt them, why create for yourself the trouble of having to deal with weddings, the wife's family side and stuff. Beside, you have the time to connect to a kid before deciding you could bond with it or not
 But my mother, told me that I'm crazy and a non blood-related child could never be loyal to me, and always leave me in the end. I told her that I want to father a child not to have someone to take care of me, but to have the feeling that If I were to pass away, I have done something right with my life. I don't know how to explain this, but it's like I will live my whole life accumulating money, knowledge and experiences, and it would feel like it'll be all for nothing if I won't spend all of those things on helping and nurturing someone else. It would feel like my all of those things is wasted somehow
 What do your parents and Vietnamese people around think about child adoption? What do you yourself think about it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my gf are at the same age, around 23. She graduated college, i'm still studying for 2 more years, she wanted to start a family at least by the age of 25. I know i'm not good enough to take responsible for such a huge commitment ( i'm not grown up enough ), not at least until i can provide for myself. We had a lot of arguments that i should accept the fact that she might leave me as she wants the best thing for her. Since then, she changed, the way she loved, the way she talked, everything must be exactly what she wants so she can trust that i'm good enough to be the one for her. Not until a lot of pressures i've been through recently, even when she is one of the biggest pressure feel, now i cant take it anymore, just want to kill myself sometimes. Not even mentioned of the things she wanted me to become when she won't accept me for who i am. I cried so much i start losing sleep, losing hairs,... However, she still cares for me, make me feel comfortable and she points out the best in me.
 What should i do when breaking up with my gf is the best thing for both of us but we love each other so much, i know it, i'm just too selfish to admit that to let her go...

I just wanted to confirm this. I asked her but she said she hadn't heard of the law (which is making me think if a local hasn't it really isn't that big of a deal). Any advice would help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I only got to spend a week there, and I did a lot of typical tourist activities. I'm American, but I actually went on vacation visiting from China back in 2019. I had been living in Beijing for a year. Beijing is a tier 1 Chinese city, but the vibe is... depressing. People generally look unhappy and stoic, similar to Soviet style culture I suppose. Chinese are inoffensive in customer service, but just... cold. When I landed in Hanoi, which is supposedly the conservative part of Vietnam, the difference was night and day. Interactions with hotel workers, restaurant workers etc was warm and welcoming. English was spoken widely, which again is total opposite of Beijing. What struck me the most was the energy. You could "feel" the progress in the air, like it was an up place where the best is yet to come. I heard China had a similar vibe in the early 2000s. Contrast with China now tho, which by 2019 had already apexed and was showing clear signs of decline. I stayed at a Hilton in the center of Hanoi and it was buzzing with business travelers. Clearly it's a growing hub of activity. I also did a junk boat trip in ha long bay, and the guy on the boat was talking about how better life has gotten in just the last 5 years. From the warm locals, to the food (tho I'll be honest Hanoi food wasn't that great, but the street food was fun and cheap... heard HCM is the place to go for food), the vibe in the air, Vietnam stole my heart and I can't wait to return. I've been to well over a dozen countries and lived in 4 continents. I would absolutely love to spend a year or two in Vietnam as it rapidly transforms and grows it's presence on the global stage. I wish you all success, I know life isn't easy for all, but as someone who's "been around the block", Vietnam is special. Keep doing what you do.

 I couldn't find much information regarding Gibbons. I know about the gibbon treks in Cat Tien but I read mixed reviews about it. Is there some better place where to see them?(preferably in central/ south Vietnam)

 I noticed a thing that with middle age customers, like 40 years old and above, when they answered "Một", a lot of them always aspirated the T, like how you say the sound T in English IPA with a burst of air. Like "Một-tuh" 
 Which is weird because as also a Vietnamese, also living in the North, next to Hanoi only 10km, I personally have rarely ever heard any one pronounced words that way. If I say "Một", I don't aspirate the T, only stop it and hold the T behind my front teeth. It doesn't come out ever with a burst of air.
 The only person I could recall also talking like that is a coworker of mine whom I used to work with a long time ago. I forgot where he came from but just not a Hanoian and also came from the North, and he always pronounce T in words like that, aspirating with a burst of air. "Biết rồi", for example, it's like "Biết-tuh rồi"
 Is this common way of pronouncing words with T?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Nanban Trade era between 16th-17th century Japan had a great interest in trading with some Southeast Asian locations due to the Ming attitude toward the sea (the Wokou pirate was a huge issue back then) and the bad relationship between Japan and China during this period.
 However, I checked on the wikipedia and found out Japanese merchants tend to arrive to Dang Trong more than Dang Ngoai for trading even though Japanese merchant ships during this period could extend really far and wide within the Southeast Asian region.
 Was there any major factors behind this?

Will they need to go back and complete every grade after 5 before they are eligible for university, or is there an equivalent to GEDs in America where they can test out of it? What resources are available for a person in this situation?
 How much time and money should they expect this process to require if they decide to pursue it?

 When the war between Russia and Ukraine started, I had to move out. As a remote worker I lived in different countries, but Vietnam is my favourite so I live here already about a year (by visa runs). 
 I really like this country, but my Vietnamese is pretty poor, since I know only about few hundred simple words and phrases. Basic verbs, pronouns, nouns, numbers e.t.c. I planning to stay in Vietnam at least until the end of the war on my homeland. So should I go study Vietnamese courses or something like that? Or it's not worth trying since I don't work here, and still don't have any at least a bit close Vietnamese friends? 
 Maybe it's enough just to continue learning passively?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, 
 I hope everyone is having amazing day so far. So long story short, me and my family with a 2 year old daughter will be visiting Vietnam in October. 
 We thought about the idea of going from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh city and visiting other cities on the cost. I’ve read a lot that it’s not recommended to rent a car and drive without a driver since the roads are dangerous. That said, I would like to know if everyone has done any similar trip with a car,buss or a train( couldn’t find this option). 
 We are thinking to spend around 2 weeks going this route hence why the car idea would be the best without a driver. 
 I would highly appreciate anyone experiences and or any tips how to travel to get the most out of the country.
 Moreover, I’m a professional driver/racer and been driving in a very dangerous places before. Thanks everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a 19 year old tourist from The Netherlands, in Vietnam. I'm here on a 30-day tourist visa that ends on October 5th.
 I have been struggling with mental health issues. I quit my marketing job back home and wanted a break to travel, so I booked flights to Vietnam to be here for roughly a month. I arrived in Hanoi on the 6th of this month, and I'm still here.
 I'm enjoying your country. I'm considering to stay, if it is possible.
 Is it?
 I would want/need to get a job. My talent is marketing (specifically English/Dutch content and SEO), and I speak English fluently, my accent however is bad.
 Besides that, I would of course need the needed documentation, like a work visa. I would need housing as well.
 Is this idea feasible or should I stop thinking about it? I just need some honest feedback from someone who knows how this kind of stuff works. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I will be travelling through Vietnam soon, it will be my second time. 
 I have never driven a motorcycle before, and first time just took grab moto taxis. This time though I am with my girlfriend and so would maybe be interested in using a bike, sometimes, instead of taking separate trips or cars. 
 When in HCMC, we have walking distance all we need, and I would not want to use a bike here anyway. 
 But in a place like Da Lat, or maybe Đà Nẵng, or Huế, I wonder if all things considered it would be a good idea. 
  
I do not want any problems with the police, so I am wondering worst case scenario what is the biggest issue we could have, a fine? Or worse? How likely is a stop anyway, I have been in Asia a lot and always see foreigners riding bikes, some with helmets (as we would) and some without (foolish) and never seen anyone have an issue. But I have heard online of issues. 
 How safe would it even be? I will avoid one hundred percent HCMC/Hanoi, but in quieter places will it be better?
 Realistically how hard is it to drive the bikes? I have ridden quads before, and also bicycles (I’d that’s relevant) 
  
It’s just likely that renting a bike in places like da làt to go see some more far away places would be ideal and cost effective. 
 If it is not a good idea though, we will just have to figure out another plan.

 I’ve been living in the US for 15 years after moving from Vietnam in my teenage years. I thought I assimilated myself pretty well: high school athlete, joined a frat in college, got a mid level management job and just recently got married to my college sweetheart. 
 Everything seems to be going well on paper but living in the suburb in a huge metropolis really starts to take a toll on me: the cost of living is insane, our combined income is well into the upper middle class in our area but it barely feels enough. Walking around downtown seeing all these people living in their high rise apartments and having boats right on the shore makes me feel tiny and insignificant. It’s humbling to put it lightly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm teaching in public schools. It's a nightmare. They are so uninterested. They have no respect. Their behavior is truly shocking. 
 I give the rules, like a stuck record before every class. I write them each time on the board. I've been nice, tried to reason with them. I've been a completed troll. I've enforced punishments, like making them stand for the duration of the lesson (now we have been told we are not to punish in anyway as learning English is just an 'extra' class, not important).
 I've explained that their behavior is unacceptable, and when someone is speaking you listen. Especially a teacher. Right after explaining they turn right around to the person behind them, and start talking or playing Uno.
 Then there is the fighting in class. Last week two boys had a full on punch up in the classroom over who got the answer right. 
 The other day I walked into a classroom, and a boy looked at me and said 'what the fuck is this?' 
 It's a fight from beginning to end. How do you cope?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Soviet Invade Afghanistan, what was Vietnam reaction, and what news did Vietnam hear from the Soviet Afghan war.
 I hear this a lot how that Soviet Afghan War is the Soviet version of the Amercian Vietnam War. Would you say it a good comparison. While the outcomes are super different because one country (Vietnam) is now stable and very good economy, while the other (Afghanistan) is now being ruled by a radical religion group that terrorize its own citizens. 
 However, both countries commit the worst war crimes in though wars, which cause a lot of political backlashed from the international community and their allies:
 USA in Vietnam: Phoenix Program, Tiger Force, Agent Orange, My Lai massacre, Thạnh Mỹ massacre, Thủy Bồ incident, Rape during the Vietnam War, Incident on Hill 192, Sơn Thắng massacre, Operation Speedy Express, Côn Đảo Prison, Phú Quốc Prison, List of bombing campaigns of the Vietnam War, 1963 South Vietnamese coup d'état, Gulf of Tonkin incident Lie, Operation Barrel Roll, 1970 Cambodian coup d'état,
 Causalities: 1,326,494–3,447,494 dead (some sources even claim 5 million people died) 
 Soviet Union: Tajbeg Palace assault, Laghman massacre, Padkhwab-e Shana massacre, Baraki Barak massacre, Kulchabat, Bala Karz and Mushkizi massacre, Kunduz massacre, 1980 student protests in Kabul, Rauzdi massacre, 3 Hoot uprising, Report Soviet troops raped Afghan women, 4 SOVIET DESERTERS TELL OF CRUEL AFGHANISTAN WAR, Chemical Warfare (Moscow's Poison War), agriculture destruction (The War In Afghanistan: Soviet Strategy and The State of the Resistance), KHAD, 
 Here a very good video: How The Afghans Defeated The Soviet Union
 Causalities: 562,000–2,000,000 killed (Some sources even claim up to 3 million) 
 with 5 million externally displaced and 2 million internally displaced which make around that Approximately 6.5% to 11.5% of Afghanistan lose it population to the soviets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for Vietnamese-speaking local guide (English NOT required) I speak Vietnamese semi-fluently and can 100% understand Vietnamese when spoken with a southern accent (I struggle a bit more with Northern and Hue accents but can probably manage. I can read very poorly but could get by if it was a life or death situation). What would be a good way to find a local guide who can dedicate 2-4 weeks to showing me around the entire country? 
 I feel this would be a good opportunity for a recent grad who wants to practice English (with someone who is fluent in both English and Vietnamese) and to go on a free vacation (with modest base pay ~$500USD for one month and basic essentials like food, lodging, etc.) covered. I would also prefer it if they are a woman (because I am female and would feel more comfortable with another woman) who knows how to drive a car/motorbike and who has experience traveling in VN. Am I being unreasonable/ too demanding?
 If it isn't clear, I am asking here because I feel most of the options I see are group tours geared towards tourists who have 0 understanding of Vietnamese language and culture and rely purely on English-speaking guides and tours. I don't really want to do these tours because they seem waay overpriced and limit what you can see or do based on availability of English-speakers. They also seem to cater to a western audience and I am not interested in that.

I'm now back in my home country and I'm really interested in living in Vietnam long term. I've looked at the visa options and job opportunities and I don't have a degree so the visa option I'm most interested in is the Investor Visa, invest 130k usd into an existing business in Vietnam or I can open a franchise like 7/11, GS25, Family Mart etc. I would not have to run it but it would be an Absentee Owner business, which I've read is very common in Vietnam and then I could get a 1 year Investor visa which can be renewed 5 times (5 years). It would be something for 2-3 years from now, so I can increase my income potential to be able to have the capital to be a foreign investor.

 We had a Hanoi-an lady work with us too, seemed not friendly or helpful at all. I thought maybe its a female thing.
 Lately i have noticed Hanoians have some major issue with southern and expats. He has the mindset hanoi team is far better , i mean fuck you bro, i taught you soo much as mentor and you act like this.
 I am even an year older than him, i always thought VN respect elders
 I told the guy to F-off, as an expat remote female employee i was very shocked and hurt by his behavior.
 Strange jealousy or acting like no one is better than him.
 So are Northern very cold towards expats? Its my bad luck, i met the wrong one 😔 😭

 I started a small food business just recently and even as a foreigner of Chinese descent (not buddhist or taoist though), I feel some Vietnamese people seem to take superstitions quite seriously, some of which is trying to say if something “unlucky” happens, it is a good sign for something lucky to come.
 Some examples: 1. Hitting the table or something metallic hardly - will bring in customers 2. Accidentally breaking glass - good sign for attracting customers 3. Raining on opening day (especially if it’s right after you done opening day prayers) - business will flourish
 What are some others you have heard?

 Just a quick run through, I parked my car in front of an abandoned empty lot on a quiet Sunday morning and had this guard running from the opposite street (not even opposite, more like a few shops down from directly opposite my car), trying to squeeze in a "service" of opening my car door for me. This same dude then demanded 20K VND as "tip" or "fee" for helping me guard my car. I of course said no because I didn't think he deserved it or that he actually owned that spot. He then proceeded to knock heavily on my window and shouted "I watched your car for you, so the fee is 20k!" - Translated by my Vietnamese girlfriend.
 Keep in mind that I'm not a fan of tipping , and if I must, I believe a tip should be reserved for those who actually deserve it, not a random guy sitting by the corner of the street insisting that he did me a service, like I can't open my own car door. Do you guys think this expectation has been terribly manifested by the tipping culture from overseas, and has now deemed as appropriate? or am I just a bad person? Also, not sure why bikes aren't subjected to tips but only cars? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I’m an American currently on a long term travel adventure and I’ve been bouncing all around Europe for a couple of months. I’m planning to head to Vietnam for the first time in a few weeks and I’m looking for a place where I can chill out for a while and truly get to know the culture and people.
 My research has pointed me at Hoi An, but I know it’s quite touristy. That’s ok, as long as I can see some culture as well.
 Some thoughts about what I’m looking for:
  
Smaller city or town is preferred. I’ve been in the massive cities in Europe and I’m ready for a slower pace for a while.
 I speak absolutely no Vietnamese. I have no qualms about using google translate, but I want to visit a place where that wouldn’t be viewed as a negative thing. In other words, someplace tourist friendly, even if it isn’t touristy.
 I tend to love seeing museums and historical sites when I travel, so someplace where at least some of that is available.
 I’m not a digital nomad, but decent internet so I can keep in touch with family and friends would be nice.
 Near a beach, even for day trips would be cool, but in no way a requirement.
  
Any suggestions? Is someplace like Hoi An/Da Nang my best option?
 I appreciate any help or tips!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am of Vietnamese origin but I have been living abroad in Europe. I am currently in Vietnam for three weeks visiting my relatives. 
 The richer part of my family living in Vietnam really wants me to move back to Vietnam and tries to find all ways possible to persuade me, one of the being the rapid improvement of life and presence of many money-making opportunities thanks to the growing economy. 
 It is true that in the last year or two I have ocassionally seen and heard some news about Vietnam's rapid development and its increasing direct foreign investment from other countries. The successful relatives really talk nice about the local life and how much better it is from Europe. They have showed me some of the nice places for richer people (I guess only really expensive for locals but affordable for foreigners). 
 Visiting Vietnam I have also seen myself that there has been improvement in Vietnamese infrastructure and services for example. However, I cannot really judge the real situation based on a three-week holiday, neither can I fully rely on my relative's point of view since they don't have the full knowledge of Europe either and their opinions might be biased.
 I need to have an objective perspective to compare it since I am biased too. How does a real life look like in Vietnam for a (upper) middle class? How would you rate your curent situation, would you move abroad if you could? How good are the international opportunities? As local, what are the things you like and dislike about the Vietnam compared to other countries?

 My mother was born and raised in Vietnam, but immigrated to the US and had me there.
 Today we saw a praying mantis, and my mother talked about how when she grew up in Vietnam, the older people in her town would chew betel nut and put the paste on praying mantises. She mentioned the reasoning behind this practice as that the older people think the praying mantis likes it too.
 This was very surprising and confusing for me, and I tried searching in Google (in English) about this custom. I can find plenty of sources about betel nut chewing in Vietnam, but nothing in particular about putting the paste on praying mantises.
 I don't think my mother was joking when she mentioned this, but I just want to hear some verification from other Vietnamese people about this custom. For additional context, she grew up in Phan Rang in Ninh Thuận.

Also, the whole point is that the gifts will be authentic and can only be found in Asia. 
 I’ve always struggled to think of Christmas gifts that are different and surprising. I know sometimes it’s best to just buy the more expensive option and call it a day. But I think this year I would like to give out multiple smaller gifts to bring a variety. I’ve got a few ideas but I’m wondering what other people would think of too. Thanks for all the help :))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm currently exploring the possibility of manufacturing silicone/tpe based products, and I was wondering if any of you might have some insights or recommendations. I want to emphasize that I'm looking for legitimate manufacturers.
 Here are some specific details about what I'm looking for:
  
Tooling: We plan to supply our own tooling, so manufacturers who can work with provided molds and specifications would be ideal. However, we're also open to exploring the costs of having tooling made in Vietnam if it makes economic sense.
 Manufacturing Location: While we're open to manufacturers outside Vietnam, we're particularly interested in understanding the manufacturing landscape within Vietnam itself. If you have knowledge about manufacturers in Vietnam or can recommend any reputable companies, please share your insights.
 Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ): Our initial requirement is a minimum order quantity of 400 units. If you know of manufacturers that can accommodate this quantity or provide competitive pricing at this scale, we'd greatly appreciate your suggestions.
 Packaging: We plan to handle the packaging ourselves, so manufacturers who can provide the product without packaging would be preferred.
  
Please keep in mind that this inquiry is for legitimate purposes, and I'm looking for advice on how to approach this inquiry in a responsible manner.
 Feel free to reply here or send me a private message if you prefer to share information privately. I can also explicitly share images of our products as well. I will also be asking you to provide examples of your work.
 Thank you in advance!
 Best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably controversial but f it. I’m (31F) solo traveling throughout Vietnam now. First I went to see family in HCM, then I began my solo journey to Hoi An and Da Nang. No issues in either place. but I’ve been in Hanoi since Saturday and walking around I’m noticing a lot of harassment from south Asian tourists . Yesterday I was in Ha Long Bay at the beach and this guy started taking photos of me. Then he came up to me and asked if he could take photos with me, I said no. Another tourist came banging on my hotel door last night on the cruise which scared the crap out of me. I told him to go away. Today I’m back in Hanoi just walking around in the old quarter and a group of them started to stare at me like I was prey. I quickly grabbed my dinner and went back to my hotel.
 I have no issues with south Asians, I have a lot of South Asian friends in the states and also work with them. They are the kindest people. They do not act like this. I just never experienced harassment from like this and it’s kind of bummer it’s happening IN Vietnam. I’m terrified to go out alone now and will probably being taking Grab everywhere for the duration of my stay even if it’s less than 10 minutes away

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was born and raised in Vietnam, moved to the states when I was 13. I’m now in my late 20s and have a full time remote job with good pay/benefits. I went back to vietnam about a week ago to attend my cousins weddings and have had so much fun. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m on vacation but I’ve seen Vietnamese people way more relax and not uptight like Americans. Breakfast and cafe in the morning will thousands of options, my cousin here in Vietnam is a freelance video editor and he works whenever and wherever he wants, around noon all the vendors close for a nap time, and at night eat out (again with thousands of options).
 Meanwhile, I work 9-5 in the states with 30mins lunch time but sometimes I eat at my desk. After work, I have to go to the grocery stores or the gym and sometimes too tired to even cook. Weekends I have to do chores and again grocery. It just feels like time is shorter in the states.
 Everything is getting more expensive in the states so my 75k a year salary doesn’t seem much. My fiancé is a teacher so her job is pretty demanding too. 
 I just feel like people in Vietnam just have more what we call ‘freedom’ the U.S has been advertising. I’ve been considering moving back to vietnam for the past few days if I can work remote and my fiancé can teach English but my parents have properties in the states and they have sacrificed so much so I can have the “best” life in America…just some thoughts
 Edit: just to clarify since some people are triggered because I use the word “freedom” what I meant is it just seem that the lifestyle and work style in Vietnam is more relax compared to America but I do understand that I’m here on vacation so people take off work to hang with me

 Then I walked around the corner and there was about 30 staff lined up on opposite sides of aisle.

 However, when I booked a Grab ride with the discount, the driver mentioned that he didn’t realize it was a discounted ride and now he’ll receive less than he initially expected. He said that discounted rides means he gets paid less.
 So, how do payments work for discounted rides? I was under the assumption of the first scenario which was why I used offers in the first place.

 Or is it even possible to go that far with them, since my bike allows only to drive 50 km/h max. It might take long, and my bike might break down if driven at the maximum limit speed for long hours

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! I'm new to this subreddit so pardon me for not knowing how to approach this subject but.. my 19 year old cousin has been alone in Vietnam for a little over a year now. Her final parent, my aunt died a little over a year ago. She's a native citizen from Vietnam. I was wondering if my family has any options of bringing her over to the US to live with us? If this is possible I was hoping someone might know the process and the steps required as she is family and we don't want her by herself in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So! It's officially been one month since I moved to Vietnam from America. So far, I'm really liking the country- even though I know I have plenty of room to grow and get to know it better. Given this, I wanted to ask some more trivial questions and provide some general comments as an adjusting newcomer.
  
Are measuring cups in cooking not a thing here? None of the stores I've found that have kitchen appliances carry them- even the more specialized ones at Aeon Mall.
 Having witnessed the car-clogged streets of Manhattan, I find the constant flow of motorbikes pretty refreshing (even if I'm terrified to ride one in Ho Chi Minh City).
 I've visited a few Buddhist temples and seen some shrines around, and they often have food in them like apples, kumquats, etc. Is this food for anyone, or does it serve a specific purpose? I don't want to take when I'm not supposed to. EDIT: Answered! I will not take that food.
 I'm still bemused by how frequently I see Lotso Bear. He seems to be pretty popular independent of Toy Story, and I'm not quite sure why.
 I hear that avoiding eye contact is generally used when Vietnamese people are frustrated, since they want to avoid direct confrontation. I've always struggled with eye contact (I'm on the autism spectrum), so would Vietnamese people read that as a sign of anger or hostility?
  
God knows, I have plenty more thoughts, but I've worked through a lot of those with some of my friends. Thank you in advance for your input. I'm happy to be here.

 My gf wants to go to Phu Quoc as she really wants to be at a nice beach whereas i want to go to Bangkok as the weather is way too hot and humid for me to enjoy it in Phu Quoc and i would stay mostly inside in Bangkok. Also i heard from alot of friends and people living in Vietnam that Phu Quoc will be 50% rain at the time we would go there (16th Oct). Also i think the remaining time we have would be too long for a trip to phu quoc (1 Week).
 What would you guys recommend? Is there maybe a nice beach not too far from Bangkok?
 Thanks in advance! :)

Cụ thể là tiền thuê nhà, chi phí sinh hoạt, ăn uống hàng ngày mình đều lo cho ảnh mỗi ngày kể từ khi yêu nhau. Ảnh thì đi xin việc ở đâu cũng bị từ chối do có hình xăm nên tính ra từ khi mới yêu ảnh mới đi làm khoảng 3 tháng (không liền nhau). Thời gian còn lại lúc nào cũng kè kè bên mình. Mình luôn động viên ảnh và chỉ yêu cầu ảnh hỗ trợ mình làm 1 vài việc chân tay. Ảnh có cơ thể khá yếu nên hay kêu mệt mỏi với mình, nhiều lúc ốm mình cũng đưa ảnh đi viện để truyền và mua thuốc cho ảnh. Thật sự với mình như vậy là mình quá cảm thông cho ảnh rồi. Nhưng cho đến hôm trước mình như tức nước vỡ bờ. Ảnh mới kiếm được 1 công việc phục vụ 5 tiếng 1 ngày thì tối ảnh tan ca qua đón mình. Đó là ngày thứ 3 anh đi làm. Như mọi hôm mình đưa anh qua cửa hàng tiện lợi mua mì và nước cho ảnh hồi sức. Sau đó bọn mình có chơi game 1 lúc rồi lại về nhà mình ăn cơm và xem phim, sau đó mình cũng gọi nước sinh tố về cho anh bồi bổ. Ăn xong mình chỉ nhờ ảnh rửa bát, lúc mình bảo thì ảnh không nói gì với mình mà cứ lẳng lặng đi làm. Nhưng lúc rửa bát thì ảnh bắt đầu khó chịu với mình và nói mình không biết thông cảm cho anh đi làm cả ngày mệt và tụi mình cãi nhau. Ảnh nói từ nay ảnh không qua ăn cơm là được nhưng suốt 1 năm qua ngày nào ảnh cũng qua ăn. Mình biết tiền không phải thước đo nhưng để làm ra tiền thì mình cũng phải mất công sức và trí tuệ nên với mình đó là tấm lòng của mình. Như vậy là mình chưa thông cảm cho ảnh phải không?

 They told me it’s so bad they will never teach it to me. It’s apparently a really old slang and you need to be local local to know, hard to find on Google as well, It’s just as bad if not worse than N-word with hard r. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY’RE REFERRING TO?
 Update: It's an old slang for natives, it's used for females specifically. "Lẹo cái" seems to be the closest one but it's not complete. It's a banned word on google, my friend's only seen one text that had it written but it's been banned since. And that this generation might not know it.

I listen to this song back in like 2009 so this song was either created in 2009 or even before. But in the song there was like 3 guy(don’t know if they were brothers or friends) but they were flirting with this one girl. I guess it’s kind of like a love song but more gear towards a younger audience. I remember in the music video the artist rode a bike 😂. Finally the 3 guys made a lot of songs together. Don’t know if they were individual artist working together or they were an actual music group that only made music together. Also it was a pretty common/popular group I believe.

The commentator, who is also a host for this streaming service, had around 250k people watching live. In the chat section, a user named "Bắn Hoả Tiễn" said something inappropriate, and in response, the commentator displayed the message "Bắn Hoả Tiễn is a dog" on the screen for all 250k viewers to see. I'm wondering why some individuals still resort to comparing others to dogs as a means of humiliating those they dislike?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why would my Vn sister-in-law do this?
 And her behaviour is really pissing me off.
 SIL asked if I wanted Ca Phe Sua Da?
 "Good idea".
 She buys 2 x Ca Phe Sua Da's. 1 for me. 1 for her. 
 I did not offer to pay. She has good job by Vn standards. Maybe that was a mistake on my side?
 But be aware I am the main banker whenever any family get-togethers occur. I pay. And they ignore me. Situation normal.
 So it felt an improvement when member of family actually thinking about me!
 I liked my Ca Phe Sua Da so much I decide to buy another one.
 I ask my SIL if she would like another Ca Phe Sua Da?
 "No".
 So I order 2 more Ca Phe Sua Da's. 1 for me and 1 for BF of SIL. ( I'm thinking of others am I not? He had no idea).
 I ask my SIL how much did the Ca Phe Sua Da man charge?
 "VND15k each. So VND30k".
 I give the guy VND30k. 
 This is where I was caught by surprise.......
 The Ca Phe Sua Da man obviously thought I had given him too much and went to put his hand in his pocket trying to say ( my Viet ain't so hot) VND25k.
 I was surprised because SIL had been very clear I would need pay VND30k.
 The amount of money is not the issue.
 What is the issue is SIL then speaks to the guy in Tieng Viet and tells him " Just take the VND30k. No need for change".
 She did not look at me. In fact she was looking away from me and the guy and at her mobile as if I would not hear and would not understand.
 He took his hand out of his pocket and tried to thank somebody and was not too sure who to look at; me or SIL. 
 So he kept his VND30k. 
 And why not! It was a very good Ca Phe Sua Da!
 The question I have is why SIL felt it necessary for foreign BIL to pay more than she did?
 Members of family frequently try to stiff me - i get the feeling they think I'm stoopid because I'm a foreigner and do not speak Tieng Viet and must therefore pay for them AND pay more.
 Hardly the behaviour of a loving family.
 What is driving this behaviour?

 My relationship with my mother is getting worse and worse everyday. She's demanding that I give her half of my salary, my salary is only 6 mil. She said that she's getting old and sick and as a child I have to give her my money,
 I refused, telling her at this age I need money for my goal and personal growth. And she kept guilt-tripping me telling she will get old and sick, I'm so fed up I told her that
 "You kept telling me that you're getting old and sick, but ever since the day you came back, what has you done for my health? Has you saved at least one penny in case my health would go bad?"
 I should've moved out earlier, it's just a part of me naively thinking that she and I could mend it back

 I personally don't like those two pronouns and don't use them much often, I think it could come out quite harsh some times, there's a reason most people don't use it with strangers. But there're people in the North assume it's the default way to call people no matter how close or distant you are, and I hate them so much, it sounds so rude if you and I aren't that close
 With my best friends and friends, I use their personal names/tôi or tao if extremely close. Ông/Tôi and Personal names/Personal names. 
 The rare cases I use "Mày" and "Tao" with my friends are when I'm trying to make a comedy skit or purpousfully acting theatrically with them.

 We don't have a car, so will get taxis etc.
 Please help us make an itinerary.
 Thank you 💞

 I will be traveling to vietnam in march for 20 days. I want to prepare my itinerary in advance which means booking transportation. Which website is the best and most legit to book tickets (mostly train) and also allows to chose which berths i would like? Also; how much in advance should i book them? Any recommendation on where to rent a bike in da nang and ninh binh? Are peony cruises worth the price for an overnight "cruise"? 
 Thank you

 I have been reading inconclusive information about visiting Hoi An in November. Can anyone advise whether it would be wise to avoid visiting Hoi An during November or is it OK?
 Am so excited about this trip!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, I was learning to drive a bike last year. Generally speaking, I was able to use it. But there was a strong fear that I could kill someone. And that fear paralysed me ultimately, so I have never driven outside parkings :)))) That’s why, generally speaking, I can’t use a bike. Plz recommend the instructor who knows how to work it out and can do that (and teach driving skills for sure :). 
 Humor (much humor) is a great tool that helped me, for example, overcome the same thing in surfing.
 Thanks.
 P.S. I have relevant driver license :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Vietnamese,
 I am a Thai girl who is interested in living in Vietnam.
 The main reason is that I love Vpop and want to learn more about Vietnamese culture. I am obsessed with some big names: Son Tun Mtp, Low G, Quang Hung masterD, Amee, Tlinh, Hoang Thuy Linh,….
 Do you know Vpop is becoming more popular in Thailand? A Vietnamese guy introduced these songs to me ☺️
 There’re many reasons I want to explore Vietnam. Youth is too short to settle down.😎
 I know there is a big difference between north and south parts. My friend says HCM’s vibe is similar to Bangkok, so I choose Hanoi. I want something different. My friend will be in Hanoi soon, so he may help me a lot. And I have at least one person to hang out with
 My main concern is job hunting in Vietnam. I want to work in person with local people, so I can make friends.
 I am living in Montreal, Canada now. I studied abroad here and got a full time job, so I have work experience
 I have a degree in graphics design and diploma in photography. 
 How’s graphics design and photography industries in Vietnam? Any chance for me to get a job at a big studios or simply work as freelancer. I want to work for a professional one. I may send portfolio to potential employers.
 My other option is teaching. I took IELTS exam 2 months ago. My overall band is 7.5. Not bad, but not good enough to be English teacher.
 I have c2 in French and have lived in French speaking environment for a long time. I am thai, but my ancestors are Chinese and British, and I can speak some mandarin. I am thinking about being a French or Thai teacher.
 Do many local people want to learn French or Thai?
 Any suggestions to adapt environment in positive way, job hunting, housing and socializing?
 How do vietnamese think about Thai in general, esp female? I know some stereotypes exist
 I accidentally found this forum while googling “work in Vietnam”. Really want to get some insightful information from you guys.
