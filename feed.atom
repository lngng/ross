        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I recently came back from a 4 month trip in Vietnam where I cruised along with hotels and airbnbs. Yes it got slightly out of hand and my budget grew.
 I work remotely and I’ve decided to try living in Vietnam longer term. I have a 5 year visa and I need to exit the country every 6 months which is fine because visit family and friends back home. 
  
 I am figuring out the right visa for me… Even though I can stay in the country for 6 months on a tourist visa. But I’m confused? 
  
I want to rent a high rise serviced apartment with 2 rooms close to the center. Is US$600 per month enough? 
 I don’t plan to party and drink (as much as I did last trip) and I’m more focused on really understanding the motherland. I want it to be more meaningful and I create real, lasting friendships. 
 So I plan to budget US$500-800 for spending money for everything I need per month.
 I’m extremely interested in investing and entrepreneurship here in Vietnam. So I’d like to start a business here. 
 I leave in December again. I’m getting travel insurance etc. visa, passport and everything renewed. 
 Any tips are welcome! Thanks.

 Looking to do two places, a week in each unless it's worth doing more splits.
 Mainly after beaches, attractions and good food, bars and restaurants also appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! I hope you are doing well.
 So early next year I am going to visit Vietnam, but I only have 7 days do explore the country. I know, 7 days is nothing in a country such as this.
 I am going to start in Ho Chi Minh, for the first 2 days, then I was thinking of taking an overnight train/bus to start making my way up to Hanoi. 
 Other than Ho Chi Minh, I would like to visit Halong Bay, or Ninh Binh, or maybe both. Then I would like to go up to the Mount Fansipan (highest point), then obviously visit Hanoi too.
 Is this doable? Do you guys have any recommendations for me?
 Thank you so much!
 All the best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am with a charity that helps newly arriving refugees. One of the things we do is provide 2 weeks of groceries to help tide them over till benefits and jobs kick in. Sometimes our volunteers provide the groceries. Sometimes people give us money and we do a grocery pickup for the case worker. 
 Will you help me create a list of basics that they may want in their kitchen? Keep in mind that the food is limited in Walmart - for example, I can't get rice noodles most of the time, so food that can be substituted is important. They will have nothing in their kitchens and we can't provide everything so knowing what foods are more common/used more is better than having a big variety of things. Meats, grains, produce spices, condiments, etc.

 This is a lot of money for me, so by no means do i mean to waste 100 dollars on shots or something. What would you do given the same condition?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see many myths perpetuated both here and in daily life. This happens with all languages (see endless arguments on YouTube about Tamil/Sanskrit/Chinese being 'the oldest language', a nonsensical notion).
 Some typical myths:
 - Vietnamese grammar is 'backwards' compared to English/other language of choice (or just difficult in general)
 - Vietnamese has many words/syllables/etc. with different meanings (making it difficult)
 - The Vietnamese writing system is difficult and 'needs' to be reformed
 Just off the top of my head, I have seen and heard these three very recently. If I sat down and thought/researched I could list many more.
 The problem is that none of these claims mean anything in isolation. Many words with different meanings---compared to what language? Difficult writing system---compared to what other writing systems? And where's the evidence? There is never or very rarely any evidence or standards of comparison given. As a linguist I could go into detail on these issues, but I'd rather see what other people have to say first.
 Now flame me and tell me why I'm wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm back in Vietnam for a few months as a break and to attend my cousins wedding in late November. I was born in Vietnam but left at a very young age and a dual citizen of both countries. I've made the stupid mistake of applying for an ID which means now that my name is in the system and they've just called me up for a health checkup tomorrow for conscription in 2023 as I'm 23yo and the age of conscription is until you're 27 (as I've recently found out).
 Has anyone been through this before? Is there any way to get out of this since I'm a dual citizen or would I have to leave the country ASAP, I did enter on my Vietnamese Passport. My mum is convinced if they conscript me I'll lose my Australian citizenship.
 I'd really appreciate some advice or if anyone could recommend me a good lawyer in Hanoi regarding this matter, thank you.

 Anyone knows what are the requirements for an American citizen and a Vietnamese citizen to get married and apply for the Vietnam 5-year visa exemption certificate? 
 Especially, any income or jobs requirements if we want to live in Vietnam for around 5 years? I assume the Vietnamese spouse has to earn a certain amount of income to sponsor the American spouse. 
 Any advices and personal experiences are greatly appreciate! Just wanna get a general idea of what we will need to deal with :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would love to know what are thoughts from different age groups of Vietnam locals about developing advanced economy, despite all the problems mentioned in different industry articles.
 My core part at work is a radical shift in commerce / production & supply chains with innovating incentives for companies, employees and end customers / consumers that adopts to clean tech driven supply chains; be it food, healthcare, renewables, electronics, FMCG, sales through new B2B, B2C channels, services, EVs etc.
 I personally love the creative designs from Vietnam that uses natural biofibers (bamboo, hyacinth etc.) & overall designs. They are at par with details from Japanese, Chinese, Thailand's creative arts - a mix of tradition, nature & modern.
 I also got surprised by recent developments & announcements by Vingroup EV making in US for US customers. & at the same time, I wonder why MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) of Vietnam are not gearing up faster at global stage. 
 For example, I never see them at industrial trade shows of the West (US, EU) or even at the East (digital or physical attendance), even though products are pretty good & innovative. Lets say Amazon SEA summit in Singapore, there are zero Vietnamese companies / MSMEs.
 Few of them are on Alibaba, but finding other MSMEs is hard as Alibaba is not that connected with new development outside of China, and the restrictions etc. makes it more complicated. 
 Also, few good points from my research are repeated in this article: on Vietnam + ASEAN region since most of our suppliers at work are looking at ASEAN countries for shifting their production from China.

She's telling me that the delivery guy can't just drop it off at her house if they can't get in contact with her. She said they usually call the recipient to pick it up and if they don't respond, they cant deliver the package?? The site didn't let me put a phone number in so idk how tf thats gonna work lol 
 If they can't contact the recipient do they just take it back to the post office and she would have to pick it up herself?

So this to me seems a bit sketchy (I identify as between socialist and ML). Who were the people that fled, just former bureaucrats for the south and sympathizers, or just your average Joe. What were the education centres? Disguised prisons or actual places where people learned about socialism? Overall, is it justified in calling Vietnam authoritarian post war and were the people justly fleeing the nation, or was it just propaganda and actual crimes of those who fled that caused the exodus

I have a lot of friends in Vietnam, and whenever I look at their pictures, or pics of their friends, or even just random Vietnamese people, they all wear Gucci and Chloe and Supreme branded shirts and shoes (I know it's all fake, because like, my guy, the floor of your home is dirt) but it's curious to me. Why go for the luxury brand stuff so much? I dont even know that many Americans into this stuff but like every Vietnamese person I see is in Balenciaga tshirts with Louis Vuitton Air Jordans on. Especially since we all know it's counterfeit. What's the point?

 from what i understand, any kind of scene is pretty minimal at the moment but there was some activity back in the 1990's/2010's. i've heard saigon and hanoi come up a lot as culture hot spots, but what is it like now? are there any memorable bands worth mentioning? is there an alternative scene in vietnam at all and what does it look like?
 i've discovered gỗlim (https://open.spotify.com/track/35WT2fGUfzi7GwKVUSR2pG?si=gPaZnkvGQHepWxtrf_HyUw&utm_source=copy-link), and i've also stumbled across 7uppercut, đá sối tội, and mona evie.
 thank you :-) ❤️

 I went to the police station nearest to the cinema, I had to Google translate and I got told to go to another police station. When I got to the other police station, the guy flat out refused to file a report for me which annoyed me.
 I’m at my wits ends I don’t know what to do. Can I apply for a new passport at the embassy without A police report?

 We are a couple from India who would be travelling to Hanoi in December, we are excited to be there!!
 We have a few questions -
  
We are trying to get tickets from Hanoi to India back, but VietJet Air seems to be rejecting our tickets, also the flights are not showing up on its website! Is there a problem with it? 
 
What should we do about the accommodations while in Vietnam, we have budget for 4 star hotels but some fellow travellers told us getting AirBnbs would be a lot better. What do you suggest?
 
We have a 6 day trip, what all places do you suggest we visit?
 
 Thanks in advance!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! We've applied for an evisa but didn't realise the offices opening hours didn't include the weekend, and we are due to fly tomorrow afternoon. We've emailed to try and speed up the process but trying to come up with other solutions. 
 We all hold british passports so would be able to enter for 14 days with just proof of a flight out of Vietnam and then extend this whilst there? 
 Any help/advice would be appreciated! :)

 On their website:
 https://ten-pac.com/direct-billing-is-great-but-not-perfect-for-everything/?utm_source=social+media&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=blog-directbilling
 they have a graphic and it says direct billing 'eliminates paperwork'...but then below that it says direct billing is useful but can have drawbacks. It goes on to say:
  
One reality most people aren’t aware of is that many medical providers charge more if you have insurance. They do this because they don’t have the additional costs of administering insurance billing and payments...
  
Surely, if the medical provider do NOT have the additional cost of administering billing and payments then the bill will be LESS not MORE?

 Has anyone been to both and can share experiences and what their favourite was and why?
 About me: I am 29(F). I don’t enjoy kicking back and relaxing on holidays (I know these places are good for that but not why I’d go) - I want to see interesting things, go on hikes, see beautiful landscapes and learn about culture and history.
 Appreciate your help! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sure that this type of question is posted and reposted multiple times around this time of year, so I apologize if I am being redundant. I searched Tet in the sub history and did not see many things regarding the questions I have.
 Firstly, my girlfriend and I are interested in traveling to Vietnam during Tet as it seems like a joyous way to celebrate the new year. Here in the US there are group activities such as bars to go to and fire work shows. We looked at cities and dates, and have thought about spending the month of January from beginning to end in Hoi An.
 I understand we may be behaving as ignorant Americans, thinking that everything will be open or that there will be mass celebrations. But we really just want to experience the culture. Is it possible -post Covid- to do this somewhere in Vietnam? Neither of us wish to be disrespectful to your country. We are realistic travelers, we know to go with the flow and are ok with buying food to make our own meals. We do NOT expect to be catered to or waited on. We want to enjoy your beautiful culture.
 Is Hoi An truly a good city for this type of thing, or should we go to Ho Chi Minh city?
 If it is possible to join a city in celebration of Tet, how should we go about this while being respectful?
 Thank you for taking the time to read this, I wish you the best.
 ​
 EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. I see I did misunderstand the nature of Tet. It seems it would be better for my girlfriend and I to visit during a different time year. I appreciate you all. We will look for somewhere else to visit.

 it'll be Da Nang by the way.
 I assume flying in with e-visa is the first step, but what then? someone mentioned the cheapest way currently is to fly to BKK and back on e-visa again every 30 days - is this right??

 I'm going to central Vietnam (Da Nang, Hoi an, Hue) in a couple days. 
 It's gonna be a short trip. We'll arrive on Monday evening and leave Saturday morning (so about 5.5 days in Vietnam?)
 So my question is, how much should I budget for this? I don't have fancy tastes or require luxurious hotels.
 And also, what's the best way to get my Dong?
 Its probably gonna be the most convenient to exchange my money at the airport but I've heard the rates aren't so good...

 About our backgrounds: Me, vietnamese, i've been working in Germany as a nurse since 2018 My fiancé, german, currently working for an enery provider.
 It'd be helpful, if anyone could give us some insights. About what we should prepare, before we make the move. Maybe someone who has recently moved there. What should we pay attention to? How is life going on for you guys in Đà Nẵng or anywhere else in Việt Nam?
 About visa: should we first register our marriage in Germany, so my fiancé can get the 5 years visa?
 We want to prepare and inform ourself before the we make the big decision. We would be thankful for any tips or resources from you guys.
 Why i am a vietnamese and i still need to ask? Because i can't possibly know everything, what my fiancé should prepare, etc ...if we should first get married in Germany, if it gives him any advantage about visa.

 The first time we met, we talked normally, suddenly he asked me "How much is my salary?". This is a question that makes me quite uncomfortable, there are many topics to ask but he chose to talk about salary first. Not to mention he has body odor, bad feet and smelly shoes which is quite annoying to me. He disrespected me in our first dating. I don't need someone who is too handsome, I just need to dress neatly and cleanly
 After that meeting, he suggested we become lovers :))), of course I refused and just wanted to stay friends but he kept bothering me, so I blocked him and no more contact. 
 As a Vietnamese myself, I get annoyed when other people ask about my salary. I don't know if it's normal to ask about salary in the first meeting for foreigners?

 I have some places in mind that I'd like to visit and have drawn up a rough timeline. I'm pretty flexible so your input and any useful information/advice would be much appreciated. I've opted for 3 nights in Hanoi as I arrive late evening. My timeline is as follows:
 Hanoi: 3 nights Sapa: 2 nights Ha Giang loop: 3 nights Halong bay: 2 nights Ninh Binh: 2 nights Vinh: 2 nights Hue: 2 nights Hoi An: 3 nights Nha Trang: 2 nights Dalat: 2 nights Mui Ne: 2 nights Ho Chi Minh: 3 nights Phu Quoc: 2 nights (Optional)

 She is first-generation Vietnamese American, so she will go by an English (Christian) name throughout the story, but she still needs a Vietnamese given name and family name. 
 The English name I'd want to give to her is Trinity -- so "Trinh" would be perfect, but I'm not sure if that'd sound weird if used as a first name. Any other ideas? I'm not super committed to "Trinity," but I'd like there to be some connection between her given name and English name.
 I also need a family name. I know "Nguyen" is the stereotypical one, but if you were reading a book with a Vietnamese main character, what other names would sound normal and natural to you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be in Ho Chi Minh for a few days at the end of October and would like to make a trip to the Mekong Delta. I have looked at offers for day trips on various sites and they all say the same and very touristy. It seems like you are driven from shop to shop to buy coconut sweets, honey and chocolate and then see a show of people playing "traditional" music for you. Maybe I'm being too sceptical and it's not a touristy mall after all, but maybe someone here has experience with this.
 Are there perhaps other providers who offer tours on less beaten paths? I am grateful for any tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello y'all, I'm a female solo traveler planning to go to Vietnam (and also Cambodia) for a backpacking trip. I'm planning to visit the country south to north (mostly focusing on the north) , and I'd like to stay in Vietnam for 25 days (I'll dedicate either 4-5 days to Cambodia, just checking out to the capital and Angkor Wat). Is that enough or too much time? My main interest are nature, and history. I don't really care about hitting the beach, and partying is okay but not like a must. My itinerary is Ho chi Minh - flight to Hoi an - Hue - Phong Nha - Tom Coc (ninh binh) - Hanoi - cruise to Ha long Bay - Ha Giang Loop . Is there anything that i'm missing?
 I'm planning to be there at the end of February, March (i'll definitely be in the north during march). Is that a good time to visit? Can I book everything once I'm already there such as accommodation/flights to have some extra flexibility, or is it high season and I'd probably book everything ahead to avoid shitty hostels and expensive flights?
 Should I bother going to Sapa or is it too cold/foggy in March, and not worth it?
 How is it safety wise? Are night buses safe, do they drop you in the middle of nowhere or you can ask them to drop you close to your accommodation? I'm not thrilled about potentially walking alone at night with a huge backpack. Can you as tourist (i'm a skinny white girl there is no way I'll pass for a Vietnamese) walk safely at night alone ? Is taking taxis/tuk tuk alone at night safe (i've lived in south america, heard way too many horror stories)?
 Thanks for all the help :)

The eggs were cooked I believe with fish sauce but I can’t quite figure it out. The eggs were scrambled I think and ended up clumpy so you could grab a piece, add to your rice and enjoy. They served rice bowl, eggs in bowl, some kind of sprouts (any ideas here too?), and other bowls of food like tofu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I have been reading a lot about ethnic, mountainous groups in rural settings of Vietnam. I came across the Chut ethnic group located in eastern Laos and in Quang Binh province and I’ve have been trying to find information on their religious beliefs and specific cultural idiosyncrasies that separate them from or align them with other ethnic practices in Vietnam. I suppose I am more trying to find out more about their “religious” practices, primarily relating to death and funeral processions. I can’t find anything. 
 Do they practice a generally “animist” belief system pertaining to the afterlife, spirits, etc? I know commonly in animist belief structure, there is this idea of the wandering soul, in that unnatural or untimely or violent death can result in malevolent spirits that cause turmoil for those around. Is this pertinent among any of the 5 subgroups (ruc, May, etc) under the Chut umbrella? 
 Thanks for any input

 Today, my MIL was telling me that she's very concerned because she follows a guy (singer? monk?) on YouTube, who is famous for raising five orphans. This is the Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/thienambenbovutru9. Apparently the guy is in jail because he's been accused of having sex with the kids, but he's claiming innocence and asking people to sign a petition for him.
 Does anyone know about this? Is this some kind of famous case? And if so, how can my MIL sign the petition for him?

 Flying to hanoi to attend a wedding at the end of the month. I will be with a group of other foreigners (10 of us from around the world)
 Have no idea what to expect, what the dress code will be or what we need to bring.
 So far we have been told the time and location of said wedding. Apparently there is a ceremony, I have been led to believe two monks will be there (what do the monks do?) that the bride and groom will then leave to take photos in a different location, then come back for the reception. 
 I’ve been told by a different friend who currently lives in Saigon that Vietnamese weddings aren’t too long, and there’s often karaoke involved. 
 Any information that will help my friends and I not be totally blindsided or make any cultural faux pas would be appreciated.

 Edit: Thanks for the excellent information guys! I think we are set on Hanoi, area because Scuba is less of a priority for us. Definitely more interested in dramatic landscapes. Really appreciate all the tips.
 Are the common scam tactics we should watch out for?
 Edit 2: After seeing comments about high chances of fog in Hanoi area we are unsure now. We are thinking central coast, as a happy medium in between both. I assume we have to fly there from either Hanoi or Saigon?

I wanted to get some perspectives on the the animist religious structure in Vietnam, “The People’s Religion” - the belief structure and its history simply interest me and I’d like to learn more; that being said, there isn’t much info online so any input would be appreciated. Here’s a general outline of what I’d like to learn that:
 1) How did belief in good/bad spirits initially come to be from the beginning?
 2) How did the colonization Vietnam by the French, invasion by Japan and the split between North and south Vietnam during the communist era effect Animist beliefs?
 3) As with Buddhism and Catholicism for example, they produce cathedrals, sculptures, art and so on - tangible forms of their doctrines. Does Animism have any equivalent buildings, depictions, etc? 
 Just a guy here trying to learn. I’d appreciate any input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seem to be a major problem in Vietnam. 
 I've never seen it on this scale anywhere else in the world apart from China.
 There are:
  
Overdevelopment by poorly run organisations who often do not finish their developments. They are left to rot as eyesores all over the country. Unfinished construction sides and rubbish everywhere. You can see this in Saigon, Hoi An, Dong Nai, Mui Ne, many places. And its too late to reverse it, the environment is already destroyed. They stay there to rot for a decade or more sometimes.
 Illegal developments, most likely with crooked local govt involvement. Example: https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/phu-quoc-to-raze-79-illegal-villas-4518959.html . And once again, the environment is totally destroyed already, cant get it back.
 Developments run by competent organisations, but way too much public land is granted to them. One example - Novaworld Phan Thiet was granted almost an entire 1km of public beach front land just for them. Likewise, big sections of Phu Quoc, Nha Trang, Quy Nhon and others have had the environment totally wiped out for all manner of empty resorts. Is this not outrageous?
  
I am interested to hear from Vietnamese especially. Are people upset and angry about stuff like this? Or do people not particularly care? Or do many people actually 'like' it or prefer it?

Nhưng từ khi bên này chạy chương trình khuyến mãi thì xảy ra rất nhiều chuyện như: giày giặt cả tháng cũng chưa có, không hề gọi điện thoại báo, để khách đi đi lại lại nhiều lần, đôi khi nổi điên thì mới sắp xếp trả giày. Mà trả giày còn ẩm ướt mới tức.
 Một lần giặt đôi thể thao trắng (mới mang được 1 lần), giày giặt hơn cả tháng mới có, xong 2 ngày sau lấy ra thì giày mốc đen toàn bộ đôi giày. Mình mang lại thì nói xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại, hẹn mình 2 tuần sau quay lại trả giày. Khi nhận lại gì một số vết ố mốc đen giặt không ra, mình có hỏi thì nhận được câu trả lời “xin lỗi” là xong. Tức cầm giày về thế là bỏ luôn đôi giày.
 Hôm nay bị một cú quá đau, cách đây hơn 1 tháng mình có gửi giặt 3 đôi giày. Mình nhờ em mình ghé lấy giày dùm, em mình chỉ kiểm tra 1 đôi thì thấy đôi trắng bị mốc đen, cũng bài cũ xin lỗi để vệ sinh lại. Em mình cầm 2 đôi còn lại về mà ko kiểm. Tối mình đi làm về mở ra xem thì muốn chết đứng luôn ạ, toàn bộ da bị co cứng, teo lại và bị chết, đế lót cong veo,...mang ko còn vừa. Mình nhắn facebook không phản hồi. Là đôi mình rất thích kiếm mãi mới có, nên giữ rất cẩn thận, mỗi lần mang ai cũng khen đẹp. Lúc mang đến thì còn đẹp, nhận lại thì eo ôi không còn nhận ra hình hài của em nó...
 Thực sự quá tệ từ dịch vụ cho đến chất lượng :((

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am just really curious that are there any decent size Youtubers that are living here in Vietnam? Not like travel youtubers that had been to the country or foreign youtubers making content exclusively Vietnamese if you know what I mean (like Phúc Mập is a good example). Youtubers like Quang Tran is a good example of what I mean, his content is not exclusively Vietnamese, like showcasing tourism, foods and culture. I see a lot of big foreign youtubers often prefer to live in Thailand, the Philippines and other East Asian countries but I don't see a lot living in Vietnam.

I've considered going to Vietnam for 1mon to do so, but I'm not sure if it's a good fit culturally and logistically. Please share any experiences or insights.
 My main concerns are:
  
working time from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. - should I look for co-working spaces etc. or is it generally realistic to use the hotel WiFi? I don't need a lot of bandwidth, but it should be stable.
 
I'm autistic and while sensory-wise bustling cities and dense traffic are totally fine, I struggle with judgemental/high conformity culture, expectations of haggling and worst, being viewed as a "target". I have lived in China and Japan, which was okay since speaking the language mitigated most of the issues. Unfortunately, the reports about Vietnam I have read point towards exactly my issues being...well, an issue. What's the real deal here?
 
 I have studied some Vietnamese and should be able to reach a low intermediate level by the time I go there, if that helps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got married to a Viet girl recently and we argue about money a lot. I was born in Canada so my idea was that we would contribute equal percentage from our income for our shared expenses, and we handle the rest ourselves (to each their own money) - however she's not happy with it. She thinks that since I make more, I should contribute more than her since I will have a lot more money left. Is this the norm for a Viet girl? House chores we share 50/50 (I'd often do more because I want to) and everything else is equal but she won't budge about this part.
 Everyone is completely misunderstanding my point. We aren't doing the 50/50 split. I pay over 70% of everything. What I suggested was we both put half of our income into a shared account from which we would pay for our expenses. The idea of each of us having separate money to handle for ourselves was from her. The point here is that she thinks I should put more than half my money and she less so, so that what's left to each of us is more or less equal. She also wants to keep her job and not have children for at least another 7-8 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working on an art piece for my father who is from Ho Chi Minh. For part of the piece I wish to incorporate a phrase in Vietnamese. However, I lost the language when I was very young and can't ask my father for help as I want it to be a surprise! I was hoping someone could help me with an accurate translation, it would mean the world. The phrase is simple but I don't want to leave it to a translating program:
 "Always remember who you are"
 This phrase holds a deep personal meaning associated with my father and I. However, the exact wording or translation can be flexible depending on what translates the best. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

So from what we've discussed in class so far not a lot of people speak french, but it seems that it's still used to some degree by the government, which seems odd to me. But more importantly my teacher believes that french in Vietnam is like the language of power, you learn it if you want to be a politician and are seen as a power seeker if you're learning the language. This doesn't seem right to me based off of the basic knowledge of Vietnamese history I have, so am I right, is she wrong?

I was hoping someone could help me translate the two words below to help him during our lesson? Google translate won’t work for these, I think. 
 Will: the one that is someone’s last dying wish, not the verb 
 Work: as in ‘things will work out,’ not like a job or to work. If you could tell me how to say the sentence “we’ll find something that works” I’d also really appreciate that! 
 If anyone knows how to say these things in Vietnamese I’d be sooo grateful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, 
 I would like to get advice from you. I highly appreciate your polite comments and valuable advice. I've wanted to work as a freelance. I'm tired of working in the office with dramas and I'd like to be flexible so Freelance is my top choice. I've worked as an English teacher and content creator before. I am trying my best to learn more about digital marketing and photoshop for my future. 
 I created my Upwork account and tried my best to apply and get proposals but there was no result. I was upset a little bit. my parents are older and they often get sick so I'd like to push myself in working freelance. Should I still look for a job patiently or get some free work and then get a rate? 
 I can write English articles, create content on social media and get a good boost. Would you like to recommend me anything? I'm pleased to listen from you guys! Thanks in advance!
 Bonus: my house is noisy so I can't teach English at home or work as n English tutor. And I'd like to manage social media than teaching kids.

He is from Hanoi and I really want to learn vietnamese with the nothern accent but all apps seem to be in the southern accent, which is way different than what he speaks. I already learned a lot about his culture, and we often find a lot of similarities. He is very interested in mine and I want to show him how important he is to me as well! Thank you all🌸
 EDIT: I seemed to have open a big discussion 😭 I said/made this post because whenever I learn with my boyfriend, or try to practice myself I send him the things, thats when he tells me that they don't say it that way/ use different words or that the pronounciation is more southerly than northern. I don't ever want to offend anyone. I just want to be able to communicate with his mom!💗 thanks for the great advice!
