 I am visiting for a couple of weeks and wanted to bring my straightening iron from my home country. I will be using an adaptor but am uncertain about the voltage. The iron says 120-240V 50/60Hz
 Will I be able to use this iron with an adaptor when I arrive? Or would the device get fried. 
 Thank you!

 When I got a chance to travel to SE Asia (once every 4 to 6 years only), I was always buying polos from 'Ralph Lauren' or 'Lacoste' on Thailand markets. If you can select the right models and ~haggle well enough you can have good deals.
 Now I'll go to Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City / Hanoi) and Laos (Luang Prabang) and would be happy to have your opinion about it. Where to buy? Can you find good quality? Are prices OK?
 Thank you in advance for any 'tip' or information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[there’s an “asian american” accent i’ve heard people talking about, and i’ve always wondered about it. i don’t really know what it is, it’s not really an “accent”, but more an inflection or a manner of speaking that makes you instantly identify the speaker as having an asian background even though you can also tell they’re a native english speaker. even some of my friends who had english as a first language still have traces of this accent.
 i was born and raised in the US but i have a somewhat noticeable accent, cause my parents immigrated shortly before i was born and only spoke viet at home. tbh i’m grateful i don’t just know englsih and can speak viet (not fluently but conversationally) but sometimes it’s hard to speak english after a while living back with my parents lmao. for example some of my vowels and consonants sound viet. words like “cold” i might accidentally pronounced as “code” and “social” as “so sho”, “your” comes out as “yer.” it’s weird when i tell ppl about this bc they’re like “uhhhh weren’t you born in orange county…?” and i’m like “yeah lmao but my english still isn’t great🧐” i still speak english fluently but often it’s hard to express myself fully (without pausing) and pronouncing words that have sounds which don’t exist in VN 
 does anyone else have this “accent”? how do you make it less noticeable?

Mình sống tâm lý chán nản ko có động lực trầm cảm lâu rồi, mỗi ngày chỉ ăn ngủ xem phim nghe nhạc chơi game, không làm đc gì kiếm ra tiền, đi làm ở ngoài xh thì mình sợ tiếp xúc nên trốn ở nhà. Rồi ảo tưởng làm idol top top mxh kiếm tiền, nhưng mãi ko thực hiện, đã thử nhưng mình dễ bị nản rồi bỏ dở ko hoạt động. Kiểu mình làm gì cũng chán. Chỉ thích mấy cái tiêu khiển giải trí nghe nhạc xem phim chơi game qua ngày. Đã ngồi vào bàn làm cái gì đó hay để vạch ra kế hoạch tương lai nhưng vẫn là chán. Mình yếu kém, ko có năng lực ko làm đc tích sự gì, kĩ năng giao tiếp kém, mình muốn thay đổi để ko bị coi thường chứ nhưng tinh thần mình trước ngoại cảnh mình hay bị yếu đuối nên kéo theo việc ngáo ngơ dễ bị đánh giá, nên mình tránh tiếp xúc con người.

And i thought I had plenty of time to spend and travel from hcmc all the way up to sapa and ha giang… but the more i search, more i reliase that i don’t have enough time for all. 
 For now my itinerary looks like this
 Feb 4,5,6 Hcmc
 Ride a overnight train to danang 
 Feb 7 One night in hoi an Feb 8 One night in danang
 morning Flight to hanoi then bus to ninh binh 
 Feb 9,10,11 Two nights in ninh binh
 Return to hanoi, halong bay or cat ba cruise
 Feb 12,13 overnight cruise
 Return to hanoi then night train to sapa
 Feb 14,15,16 two nights in sapa
 Bus to ha giang
 Feb 17,18,19,20 Three nights in ha giang
 Return early to hanoi feb20
 Chill at hanoi feb 21
 Am i putting myself into too much things to do? Tbh if i had known theres not much to enjoy in south i wouldve flown to danang as im more interested in nature and sightseeing. But since i have already booked my ticket and its quite pricy to change it… what could be the best option for now?

 I'm currently in the US for university, forced by my mother to go here. Despite my efforts to convince her that I hate the US, she still signed me up for SAT tutoring, and SAT exam, and also applied to the school I am currently studying at, with the help of a language center.

 I have tried to convince her saying I do not want to go to the US, but she doesn't care. She is convinced that it is good for me, and even more so since my older brother is also there, who went to and graduated from the same university.

 I moved here right after finishing high school a few months ago. So now I am here in the US, Alabama (terrible state I know, I was forced to, it was not my choice).…]]></summary>

What's the relevance of an IDP. I contacted a motorbike company in HCMC and after telling me any bike I bought would be confiscated he is no longer replying.

I have never really wanted to settle and study here but now it is like I was forced to live like this for possibly years before becoming on my own. It's not America per se that is the problem, but the circumstance under which I got here. TL;DR at the end of this Ted talk. 
 To start with, my family really wanted us to study abroad and hopefully move to the US as I grow up, considering my other relatives already living there. Tbh, I had no interest in going to the US to "seek opportunity" and I surmised life would be depressing to me, at least. So I continued minding my own business in high school: making friends, getting grades, dating. In 10th grade, the concern of studying abroad rose to me, but I was …]]></summary>

I have celebrated the Lunar New Year with him/his family for the past 3 years, and there's a Tết festival we will be attending this year. I would really love to get an ao dai and wear it to the festival- I've only ever worn normal clothes. I think they're beautiful and since I plan on marrying my boyfriend I would like to embrace his culture as much as I can. I'm honestly a little shy to ask him about wearing one, he was born here and is pretty Americanized so I'm not sure if he'll think it's weird if I asked.

 Also looking for this weasel and mountain coffee. Is it worth it or just hype? Where to buy them that's not in exorbitant prices. I once bought hazelnut roasted beans (not in Vietnam) that smelled so good but was rather bland or weak in taste. Somewhat they took the coffee taste away but infused the smell.
 The coffee flavors here are sweet like those instant 3 in 1. The saigon, egg and salted coffee were the least of my favorites. Coconut coffee is...yeah unique i like the most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m Vietnamese-American and was visiting Hanoi for a week. I’ve played pickup basketball in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and saw there were a few nice outdoor courts in HN that I wanted to try out. 
 My experience below was pretty ass. Are there any public pickup spots for basketball in Hanoi? Would love to meet up for some games next year when I’m there. 
 -Sân Bóng Rổ HK Sport: Came at 6pm on a Friday. No entrance fee but zero people at the basketball court. It looked nice though, I left immediately. -Sân Bóng Rổ CLB Ba Đình: Came at 5pm on Friday. Security at the facility main gate said they are fixing the court and it’s closed. Not sure I even went to the right place though. -The New Quarter (612 Đ. Hoàng Hoa Thám, Bưởi, Ba Đình, Hà Nội, Vietnam): Arrived 6:30pm on Friday. Nice one and half courts. About 25 people mostly teenagers shooting around. A group seemed to have reserved the full court for a party without playing any games. I shot around for an hour before asking to start playing 3’s. After the game ended, some guys said their friends showed up and started their own games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our hostel warden gave us the worst possible experience just now. We have a booking for 4 of us and we had a friend drop by to our private room to use washroom facilities. The warden threw a hissy fit and started yelling and raising hell and gave us a very rough time. Plus, there was no way to properly explain to him that it was just a friend dropping by a bit, and not an escort - since he doesn’t understand english. 
 He harasses us further by locking us in and not letting our friend out for about an hour. He then threatened to report us to police and demanded money to the tune of 30 million dong (which he said was to pay the cops). He also refused to get us the manager. We are all very shaken by this experience, and are quite convinced it wasn’t lawful at all. After he realised that he wasn’t getting a penny out of us, he calmed down after a bit and opened the shutters.
 What can we do about it?
 P.S: We’re in HCMC, and booked the hostel via Hostelworld.

 I’m planning to visit Vietnam in January/February for a bit more than 3 weeks.
 I will arrive in Hanoi and will return from HCMC.
 The idea was to explore the northern part of Vietnam and to do Hi Giang loop, but I understand that it is not recommend due to bad weather ?
 It’s surprising because I have found many website telling that the weather would be cold and dry.
 Any opinions?
 Many thanks !!

 As many westerns who love to explore eating, I absolutely fell in love with the Bahn Mi; especially Vietnamese Ham (Cha Lua) which I just adore so much I want to make my own. My biggest worry with creating this delectable meat is botulism. I would like to follow the recipe bellow and have all of the ingredients and equipment to do so:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXqvP7y0WM
 Is there any risks of botulism by using this method?
 If you make a really big batch can you vacuum pack the rest and store in the freezer? Any botulism or food risk there?
 I really would like to explore this but it is very new for me and I want to be as safe as possible.
 Thank you very much for time.
 Kevin

 As an Indian, I visited Vietnam recently and I noticed that cab drivers, hotel managers, tour guides, or the people in general whom I met welcomed me and showed positive gesture towards me. During my trip, I visited only famous places which are often visited by any tourist. But, I want to understand the sentiment of any Vietnamese towards Indians who not necessarily reside in those cities.

Last month I've matched with a woman (32F) on Tinder who lives in Tra Vinh. She's a university professor and says that she's unconventional for her environment (isn't looking for marriage and having kids). We've had a couple of video calls and she seems genuine and honest. 
 So she invited me to visit her at her home for a couple of days. Given that I'm a foreigner in this country it makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable especially because I've never received such an invitation before.
 Am I going to be abducted or am I being a bit paranoid? Anything I should be worried about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an American living and working in Hanoi. I'm trying to become more educated on Vietnamese table manners. This topic has been frustrating to me. My Vietnamese girlfriend and my Vietnamese friends have commented on some of my bad table manners. It's been difficult for me to try and change my eating habits. 
 Here are some of the things I experienced:
  
Vietnamese share their meals. My girlfriend told me that I should share food so I don't appear selfish. Usually in the US, my friends and I would just share an appetizer and then I would just eat the dish I ordered. I also had difficulty adjusting to this because I was concerned with hygiene. 
 Vietnamese aren't so finicky with hygiene. My friends share food using the same chopsticks they eat with, and when I have beer with friends they handle the ice cubes with their hands. Surprising at first, but I don't make a fuss about it.
 I shouldn't accept food using my chopsticks when someone is offering food with their chopsticks. I just did this once, and people told me I shouldn't do it. I'm not sure why it is rude though. 
 I shouldn't eat fast. My girlfriend told me it looks bad. I guess I eat fast, but for me it's my normal pace. I didn't have long lunch breaks in school/work in the US, so I guess that's why.
 I have to let old people eat first. I usually don't eat with older people, but I was told about this. I had food with a friend's family, and I didn't eat until her grandparents started eating. 
  
I read a few more online, but I don't know what's true. For example, it's unlucky to flip a whole fish when eating. I have a Chinese uncle who that told me about that, but my girlfriend never heard of it.
 I hope I can receive some feedback and tips on improving my table manners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Em hiện giờ đang học lớp 12. Từ khi lên cấp 3 em quyết định đi du học nên em hoàn toàn chăm chú thực hiện mục đích đó thôi - đến trên lớp em cũng chỉ cày điểm ngang mức yêu cầu của bên trường đh đó, còn từ khi lên 12 thì em gần như bỏ hết mấy môn không cần thiết mà chỉ tập trung một vài môn yêu cầu thôi. Thế nhưng mới 2 tuần trước mẹ em lại bị diagnosed with ung thư tử cung giai đoạn cuối ạ. Gia đình em ngoài mẹ ra thì chỉ có nguồn thu nhập là ba em - là giáo viên nên lương ba cũng ko cao. Em thì vẫn ưu tiên việc chữa trị của mẹ nên việc du học ko thực hiện được thì vẫn ok. Nhưng về ngành mà em muốn học (Thiết kế đồ hoạ), thì cả gia đình em đều phản đối nếu học ở Việt Nam í, vì ngành đó ko phát triển ở đây. Ngoài ngành đó ra thì em thực sự không muốn hay đam mê học ngành nào khác. Em cũng chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến việc học ở Việt Nam... Nhưng rồi em cũng chỉ còn 5 tháng nữa để tốt nghiệp thôi ạ, nên cần quyết định càng sớm càng tốt i. 
 Theo mn nghĩ thì em nên take gap year không ạ? Em ko quan tâm đến việc thụt lùi so với mấy bạn đồng lứa hay opinion mấy người xung quanh đâu, chỉ cần là hướng đi tốt thì em sẽ cân nhắc ạ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been studying Vietnamese for about a month now and I’ve acquired some sentences and words. However, I did notice that there’s two dialects/accents to Vietnamese. When I look on TikTok I always see southern Vietnamese people talking about how the northern accent is complicated and sometimes hard to understand. But at the same time, most Vietnamese songs are written in the northern dialect and most apps only teach the Northern dialect. As a person who lives in the United States, I’ve seen sources state that most Vietnamese Americans speak with the southern dialect. Obviously I would want to make learning Vietnamese as easy as possible by learning the most commonly used dialect or easiest dialect to learn and understand. So this leads me to my question, should I learn the northern or southern dialect?

 My current plan is 2 nights in Saigon (XO Food Tour on motorbike, Cu Chi Tunnels, Mekong Delta), 2 nights in Hoi An (bike tour, basket boats, etc.), and 3 nights in Hanoi (possibly with a trip to Ha Long Bay). I will be flying between all of these.
 Am I doing too much? Should I cut one of these out of my trip and extend time in the other two places?

 I’m coming back to stay for a year and haven’t been keeping up with the changes in Vietnam. After quite a bit of researching, found surprising amounts of innovations and quality of life changes.
 For example: 
 Grab now offers food/packages/personal items delivery.
 Online transactions are a lot more prominent now than before and of course the growth of massive commerce space like Lazada and shopee
 Paying with virtual wallet is a thing
 My general question is,
 What major quality of life changes have happened the past 7 years?

 If we want any apology or recognition from Japan we must first acknowledge and apologize for this stain on our nation’s soul.
 I’m just kind of in abject horror right now that it took me so long to learn about this.

 I will be traveling to HCMC in February for 4 weeks. This is my once in a lifetime dream trip and I really want to get the most out of it but I think my itinerary wishlist has grown a little out of control... I'm hoping people will have input on places to spend 1-2 days (or just skip completely?)
 At a minimum, I'm hoping to go to: HCMC (both for Tết and for arrival/departure) Phú Quốc Đà Nẵng Huế A cruise at Vịnh Hạ Long, Vịnh Bái Tử Long, or Vịnh Lan Hạ
 The plan is to spend maybe 1 day in Hà Nội
 The nice-to-haves: Cần Thơ, Hội An, Ninh Bình, and Cam Ranh.
 I went for 2 weeks before and was able to visit HCMC, Đà Lạt, Nha Trang, and Vũng Tàu and didn't feel it was too much but I think I'm over the limit this time.
 Sorry... that's a lot of info but if anyone has opinions, I would love to hear them! :) Cảm ơn nhiều

 Mình hiểu qua cách chơi đề, bạn ra quán nước chọn một con số rồi chờ cuối ngày đề về. Nếu trùng số thì 1 ăn 70 hay 80 gì đó.
 Nhưng ai là nhà cái, có phải các chủ quán nước tự quản không hay họ có “cấp trên” là nhà cái tổng? Nếu có nhà cái tổng thì các quán nước cấp dưới của họ thu lợi nhuận như thế nào?
 Có hệ thống phân cấp rạch ròi như kiểu một công ty hay Giáo hội không? Các nhà cái có nhà cái cấp trên và cứ thế đi lên tới một ông sếp cuối cùng? Nếu có thì ông này là ai và làm thế nào để ngoi lên được chức đó? Nếu không thì các nhà cái hoạt động như những đơn vị độc lập có cạnh tranh trực tiếp với nhau không và như nào? Họ có tranh giành địa bàn, cạnh tranh tỉ lệ thắng, thâu tóm khách hàng?
 Vai trò của công an trong hệ thống chơi đề như thế nào?

As opposed to buying here online from US? Google flights shows flight from hanoi to HCMC for $600usd. If I wait and purchase online from Vietnamese airlines, will I be cheaper? What about once I've arrived and seeing a travel agency for this? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 ​
 My mates (foreigners) and my gf (Vietnamese) will tour Vietnam in February while she is visiting home for Tet.
 I am planning for an itinerary for Ha Long where I will arrive on the evening of 5th Feb and leave for Hanoi on the 8th of Feb in the early afternoon giving us a full day (7 Feb to plan day activities).
 We have an accommodation planned in Ha Long city for the days. Can anyone suggest if there can be some alternatives to cruise trips for the days that we are there? I have heard about some tours in Cat ba island but not sure how to choose them yet.
 I am looking to find alternatives to the Ha Long cruise for a few reasons - 
 - My gf thinks it's dangerous and she doesn't want to go on an overnight cruise because she is just visiting there for photos(?)
 - Cruise may be a bit expensive for some of us. I am finding people suggesting against cheaper tours and so may have to look at something atleast upwards of $200 USD for an overnight tour.
 ​
 I am happy to receive any counterarguments and maybe I can convince my gf if there are some suggestions to go for it. 
 Would anyone be able to suggest some tours or any day activities that can get us most of Ha Long/Cat Ba for the duration we are there?
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào mọi người, hiện tại em k biết nên xem đây mối quan hệ mập mờ hay bạn bè (trên tình bạn dưới tình yêu). Khoảng thời gian trước đó, em thích bạn và bạn đó cũng biết nhưng chỉ muốn làm bạn với em thôi. Sau này, bạn tặng em rất nhiều đồ handmade, skinship hay tựa vào em và còn tặng quà giá trị bất ngờ cho em. Nhưng mỗi khi em đề cập lại chuyện em thích bạn thì bạn lảnh tránh xa việc khác. Thật sự khó ấy mn!!!

 I am a massive NFL fan and would hate to miss the big game. Would I have any options to watch? I would be willing to rent a property with a TV if there a reliable way to stream. Curious is anyone has any experience watching American football in South East Asia. Thanks.

Có những món đồ hàng về mở ra không dùng được lại phí tiền. Còn những đứa con khác tự mua đồ trong gia đình bằng tiền của bản thân chứ có phải đặt theo ý của bả rồi bắt mẹ trả tiền vậy đâu.

We ordered one based on the line alone and then asked someone else nearby with one what it was. They gave us the name of the dish, xoi xeo, but other than sticky rice and crispy onion, we're not sure exactly what all was on it. I only wish we'd found this earlier because it was quite possibly one of the best things I've had in a long time. Online search wasn't helpful and gave variations, I'm curious what's on this one...

I’m going to break down the cities I like and the cities I don’t like with the hope that people could help give me insight to where I would like to go in the future as I spend 2-3 more weeks here going south. 
 Like: Hanoi, Ha Giang, Ninh Binh, Da Nang
 Dislike: Halong Bay, Hoi An, Sa Pa
 I was thinking of going to Nha Trang, Mu Nue, Dalat, Saigon, and potentially Phu Quoc. 
 I reeeeealy don’t like cities that feel overly touristy and of my three dislikes, they all did to me. Still have some nice things to offer but just not where I feel like being. 
 Any suggestions on my future itinerary in terms of places to add or remove based on my preferences? I am comfortable on a motorbike so that should be considered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I visited Vietnam this earlier this month and just came back recently. I never knew I would like visiting Vietnam that much! 
 I never thought I would want to visit Vietnam again, but now I want to visit every year or every other year if possible. I really enjoyed the food and the shopping, but wasn’t a big fan of the weather (I prefer cold and foggy weather). 
 Maybe it’s because I was always comparing to U.S. prices, but everything was very cheap/affordable. Where I live, it’s easily $17-20 for a bowl of pho or bun bo hue. I ordered 3 bowls of bun bo hue off grab and it was only 160k (the portion sizes are smaller but even if I ate all 3 myself, that’s only about $6.50?) 
 I did a lot of searching on this reddit to see where I should get my hair cut done at. I ended up going to Hair Bar in district 1 - for females, it was 580k for shampoo+mini massage, hair cut, and styling (480k if you want a quick shampoo). I’m sure there are cheaper places, but I wanted to try and get the best if possible. I recommended my sister in law to go there as well, she also enjoyed it.
 For a full body massage, facial, and hair wash, I went to Yushi Clinic Beauty & Spa in district 3 and it was about 840k for a wonderful experience - it was about 2.5 hrs long. It could have been cheaper, but I asked for some add-ons such as the facial and a scalp treatment. 
 For clothes shopping, some of the shops I enjoyed were: Uniqlo SC Studios ($30-110/item ; lots of linen & silk) Rosie ($12-30 for most items, $40-50 for coats) Libe ($12-30/item) Dear Jose ($80+ dresses) Secondee Flanh
 I visited Aufra & Len Clothing as well which had some nice styles, but the quality wasn’t as nice as say, Libe or Rosie, for the same cost. 
 My favorites were SC Studios and Rosie

Haircut was very good and man was friendly but that was just very weird and I'd never expect that from an older gentlemen, maybe a bargirl in thailand perhaps. Any people experience that ?

I've been in some queues, and especially young adults are those who seem not to care about the line and just cut it for their own good. Imo, it's better to ask people when we start queuing whether they are in a line and wait until our turn. I love Viet Nam, but i hope people will eventually get better mindset to be nicer to others. Have a good day, yall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I've scored a cheap flight, a roundtrip ticket from Hanoi to Siem reap with Vietjet Air. As a budget traveler, i think the price is a good deal. However, I've read a lot of negative reviews with vietjet air about delays and terrible customer service. Has anybody here had experience with Vietjet from Hanoi to Siem reap and how was the experience? also since i dont have checked-in luggage, can i check in online to skip the q at the baggage counter? thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Met a nice businessman from Singapore who told me about buying property in Vietnam as an investment. He’s very bullish on the real estate in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. Sounds like a really attractive prospect since I can’t really afford a home in California. 
 Was wondering how this works. I’m assuming it’s frowned upon but also isn’t Vietnam communist? So can one truly purchase land or is it land use rights? Is there a property management industry like the US? Is contract law respected here? Can a foreigner even own land?
 As a fast growing economy I see reason to both allow and limit how foreign investment enters a country (especially after seeing how foreign money came into the states pre-pandemic).
 Disclaimer: I’m just a tourist and I don’t think I’d actually buy here. I don’t have any personal ties here so I’d be too scared to put significant money here. The businessman told me about police bribery and getting screwed over by his last partner here.

 My 18 yo nephew in-law is Vietnamese, speaks good English and is also starting to read books in English. I want to help find him some appropriate novels to start with, so I'm interested to see what other Viet->Eng learners went with when they started reading. 
 He's most interested in adventure and detective fiction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[as the title says.
 recently my (French) friend who was working in HCMC told me about his Vietnamese teacher's "weird lessons":
  
she took him to a bookstore and grabbed a few 123Vietnamese books (he paid for them)
 "just complete the exercises"
 two (or three, if she's free) 1-hour coffee dates each week where they talked about random topics in Vietnamese (he paid for the drinks)
 she would help him translate Vietnamese things via zalo
  
apparently he learned nothing more than what to say after "xin chào" and a few slurs, and he had been learning for almost two months. when i asked about the price, it was around 300,000vnđ / date and a flat fee of 1,500,000đ per month for the zalo help. isn't that a lot?
 things were so weird so i had to ask about the teacher herself. and after some quick check on her zalo profile: she was a 20yo university student whose major was definitely not teaching Vietnamese. i felt so bad for the guy and i gave him some advices to look for a new teacher or just go to language center that offers better services.
 this was not a "scam", just a plain bad way to teach someone Vietnamese while having a fairly high price.
 definitely a scam where she tricked the foreigner into thinking she's a professional.
 time is tough recently, i know, but girl (and guy) please, being a Vietnamese does not mean you are allowed to "teach" a foreigner. can you guys just be language exchange partners instead?

 I was hoping someone that is doing the loop would be able to make a slight detour and collect it.
 It is on the main road that is apart of the loop, and approximately 40m off the road in the bush.
 If anyone is able to, I can privately send them the exact coordinates, as well as satellite imagery of the exact location. 
 Offering a 1 Million Vietnamese Dong reward I will also pay for postage of just the SD card, and you may keep the drone if you want.

 I saw that many people think that compare a person to a dog is a casual, light-hearted joke. I am not sure about that in western, but in Vietnam, it is totally not true. In Vietnam, compared a person to a dog, no matter your intention, is a serious insult asking for violence. The similar one in the west is "fu*k u bit*h!" or "you son of a bit*h!". So yeah, just don't do it. The only exception is that you intentionally want to insult the other and want to have a fight :)
 Edit: as mentioned by some people "cún" (puppy) is fine for kids and girl friends to show that they are cute and you love them. "chó", on the other hand, is not ok.

 Unfortunately I couldnt get out of the staff whether or not sales tax (10%) was applied to these products or if they are tax free/reduced taxation applies. I cant find anything online really.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, so I bought a motorbike in Saigon a little over a month ago.
 I took it to Cambodia pretty much immediately. No one batted an eye about the bike. I drove it straight through. Not asked for papers or nothing. Spent a week there and then went back to Vietnam. Same story.
 After spending a few weeks riding up through Vietnam and getting caught in some heavy rainfall and cold as shit weather I figured I'd cross over to Laos and get some sun.
 I was wrong. I tried crossing the border near Khe Sanh, I think it was called Lao Bao. They wouldn't let me take the bike. Didn't even ask for the papers, just straight up no.
 Should I try a different crossing? How do I get my bike into Laos? Would love to get some tips on this.

 What is this? Is this some sort of rent a girlfriend service or sugar daddy/sugar baby relationship?

 My partner and I are big foodies and all the travel blogs we've seen have shown how well priced and good the food is there (especially seafood). 
 What are your recommendations for any specific street food shops/markets/restaurants in Da Nang?
 My understanding is seafood will be the focus but all recommendations welcome. 
 Of course, any pho and bahn mi recommendations are a must-have too.

We supposed to meet a friend of my mom around district 9 then he drived us all to Phan Thiet. We couldn't find a proper parking slot but a nice household let we parked at their home. The thing is there is no ticket required. Even though i have some small bumps of uncertainties, i still gamble over the kindness and friendliness in Vietnamese. It may be my overthinking mind. It would be extremely helpful for me to know what is your opinion about this. Thanks a lot. Have a great day too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 My parents immigrated a few years before I was born in the US. I have a bit of family back home whom I've only met once. But of course I understand it's very tough back home and my family struggles often with money. 
 One of my cousins is graduating high school this year and I just learned today that her parents are in no place to afford college tuition. They've all resigned themselves to that reality. My older cousin (different parents) also couldn't go to college and she makes 7 million a month, and the cycle of economic struggle persists. I'm in a position to send money for my little cousin's tuition, unfortunately couldn't help my older cousin in the same way. It is a no brainer for me. However, I want understanding of what higher education in Vietnam entails. More so out of curiosity and wanting to show support in learning about her experience than anything else.
 What is the cost? My family is based in Saigon, what are the schools nearby like, I don't think she is interested in being too far from family. Is it difficult to get into universities? What opportunities does a college degree afford? Googling I found the average entry level salary for a college graduate is 20-25 million. Any other information that comes to mind that I didn't think of?
 My mother didn't finish 8th grade due to poverty and hardship. My brother and I now have master's degrees, it is her greatest pride. I'm now a teacher, nothing is more important to me than education and knowledge. Thank you so much for helping me become better informed!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left my laptop at the security scan @ Noi Bai airport last week. I didn't realize this until I had flown back to Canada, my home country. Noi Bai's lost and found website shows they have it in their possession (they take pictures and post them on their website of all of their lost items). I have hired a vietnamese interpreter to speak to staff there, however they are saying it's not their responsibility to put the lost item on the plane and that it is the responsibility of the airlines. I have contacted Japan airlines, the airline I flew on and their customer service is telling me it is the responsibility of the security/lost & found staff, so now I'm in this circle of each party saying it's the other person's responsbility. Has anyone on here ever lost something at Noi Bai? Can you tell me the steps you took to retrieve your item? (This is a laptop by the way) Any help here would be greatly appreciated as it has just about been two weeks and a dozen phone calls and I have gotten absolutely nowhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a theory, and I'm hoping someone here can confirm or debunk it for me.
 I spent the weekend celebrating Christmas in Tam Đảo (it was lovely, thank you, merry Christmas), and I saw something that I've only seen a couple of times over the many years that I have lived here, but I think there has to be a reason behind it.
 Two big, black, brand new SUVs drove by with the blue government plates, then a meticulously upkept early 90's Toyota corolla, then two more fancy SUVs with government plates, and the guy in the corolla was dressed very well, clearly had money.
 Now, my theory is super wealthy people in VN have their cars from the early 90's, and because they're really rich, they're perfectly taken care of. And the reason for showing off such a generic, low-end car is because they are conveying that they are rich enough and important enough that they were able to afford a car in the early 90's, when this was an extreme rarity. 
 Is this a real thing, or is there some other reason for this? Because I have only seen it a few times, but it has been more than once, so there has to be some reason that wealthy/well-connected people would choose to drive a 90's corolla or equivalent level car, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Vietnamese comment on Reddit told me that I am not Vietnamese if I don't see the fact the majority of people in Vietnam removed the right-side mirror of their motorcycle (if there are 7 motorcycles in the street, there are 5 motorcycles that have been removed the right-side mirror). But I don't see that in my city (Da Nang) and other Vietnamese cities I have traveled to. The vast majority of bikes have two mirrors on both sides. The percentage of bikes with the right-side mirror removed is so low that it is unnoticeable. This percentage may be as high as the percentage of motorbikes that lost the left-side mirror or the motorbikes that lost mirrors on both sides.
 Another Reddit comment assumes that I am Vietnamese but living overseas. And so on....
 I brought it to a Vietnamese forum VOZ and asked if the experience of Reddit Vietnamese matched what happens in the place Vozer lives, they confirmed it was real. Maybe they joke to me, I don't know. But If people are joking, please stop, I don't know what is joking and what is real. What I see with my own eyes from when I was born to now (being a 25-year-old man) is not something people in Reddit and Voz described.
 I am Vietnamese but people say that I am not Vietnamese, even when I have written in Vietnamese in a local/urban/vulgar style that only Vietnamese use. They just said to me that I use Google, Google Translate, ChatGPT, or AI to pretend I am Vietnamese. It is kind of sad.

 Hải SapaTV là 1 kênh youtube ẩm thực thuộc diện lớn ở VN, với hơn 1 triệu người đăng ký, nhiều đầu mối bán hàng, có nhà hàng và khách sạn ở Sapa, và quan hệ rộng. Trước gia đình mình các cụ ở nhà rảnh rỗi hay xem. Thấy nó quảng cáo bán hàng khá hấp dẫn nên vừa rồi các cụ cũng đặt mua hàng.
 Mặt hàng này là thịt trâu gác bếp (thịt trâu sấy khô). Quảng cáo là để trong tủ đá trữ được 6 tháng. Bán khá đắt (1 triệu vnd / 1kg) nên mình hi vọng chất lượng tốt. 
 Không ngờ mua về để tủ đá, mới được hơn 1 tuần thì 1 gói đã mốc trắng như vậy.
 Mình gọi điện đường dây nóng phản ánh với chủ shop thì chủ shop mồm năm miệng mười, nói lấn át cả khách, đổ lỗi cho khách bảo quản.
 Mình để cả 2 gói trong tủ đá, nếu do bảo quản thì cả 2 phải bị chứ. Chưa kể trong tủ đá còn rất nhiều đồ ăn khô không bị làm sao.
 Theo mình suy đoán thì vì bán nhiều hàng nên nó làm láo, trộng hàng cũ vào bán cho khách online. Ai không cẩn thận là ăn phải hàng ôi thiu. 
 Mình post lên để mọi người đề phòng với kênh youtube và hội này. Đừng để vừa mất tiền vừa mua tức vào người.
 Long story short, if you don’t know Vietnamese, stay away from SapaTV food, restaurants, and hotel. I bought their products and receive old, rotten food.

Does this make sense, or shall we spend an extra day in Cat ba? which hotel would you recommend and which activities?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first noticed this on a scooter, I thought maybe they were too poor to replace it. I thought it looks ridiculous. I've heard that only the left is required by law. Do locals remove it because they think mirrors look uncool? I really don't understand the point in it, even if you don't look in the mirrors, why remove them? I don't recall noticing it anywhere else in southeast Asia. Since then I've noticed maybe 40% or more of the scooters in my area only keep a small left mirror on the bike, especially Vario drivers... I drive a Vario myself and look in the right mirror a lot to keep an eye out for any ninjas creeping up to overtake me on the right side.

So Im 17 yo guy, naturally my family is starting to ask "hey you got a girlfriend yet?", of course no, so they reply with "oh how about finding a girlfriend here, marry and bring her back to german?". I was a bit put off because in germany (or west) people marry in a much older age and woman want alot of privacy and freedom. I doubt that that these days girls in VN would want to marry that quick and leave their country, but Im not sure with my lack of knowledge so how is your guys views on this stuff?
 Edit: Thanks for the replies. I dont actually think of doing it lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chao,
 Next month I intend to cycle from HCMC to Hanoi, with roughly the following itinerary over 28 days:
 HCMC - Vung Tau - La Gi - Mui Ne - Thap Cham - Da Lat - Nha Trang - Tuy Hoa - Quy Nhon
 (bus to Kon Tum) - Mang Den - Da Ban - Quang Ngai - Hoi An - Da Nang - Hue
 (train to Ninh Binh) - Tam Coc loop - (train to Hanoi)
 Ideally I want to spend 2+ days in the larger places mentioned and 3 in the big cities. Now the questions:
 ​
  
If I dismantle my touring bike (front wheel off) and have it bagged, is it possible to transport it on a bus if I want to "skip" a stage (due to bad weather, injury, etc.) - e.g. Quy Nhon -> Kon Tum
 How easy is it to ride out of HCMC towards Vung Tau?
 Away from the coast, is it necessary to book hotels/guesthouses in advance, or can you just show up on the day and realistically expect a room? (my dates don't overlap with Tet). Ideally I'd like to save weight and not have to bring a tent or wild camp.
 I only finalised this trip last week, so probably won't be able to learn/speak much Tieng Viet language, and my tonal pronunciation will probably be wrong. Is this likely to be a big barrier in the rural parts of the Central Highlands?
 Do most hotels/guesthouses/hostels accept card payment?
 For trains (e.g. Hue to Ninh Binh) do tickets (particularly for travellers with bicycles) need to be reserved a day in advance?
 Are there any parts of that itinerary that you reckon should be skipped given that it's January?
 And are there any sights you would really recommend that I've not included? (I've excluded Sapa, Ha Giang and Dien Bien Phu given that presumably it's pretty cold (<10 degrees) at this time of year, and I would guess the earliest days of February in Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay can still be foggy, so I'd leave that for a summer trip, given I only have 28 days). The karst caves at Phong Nga are, I guess, probably tricky to reach on a bicycle too.
  
Cam on rat nhieu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Just wondering about the title.
 From my time I met with a Vietnamese woman. She was married but wore no ring. Said he husband cheats on her but she couldn't leave him because it was frowned upon by her family unless she had someone else who could look after her. Even then her family would have to go to his to make the arrangements for her to leave him. 
 Is divorce really looked down upon in Vietnam or is this bullshit?

How long does USPS going to ship to Vietnam? I’ve never seen anyone successfully receive their package from US to Vietnam through USPS. 
 One more package I have is using DHL to ship, from Germany to Vietnam. However the package lost update since November 6 and my seller filed for lost parcel. But on December 15 the tracking was back but it has been stuck in customs since then.
 I don’t know what to do besides waiting, but I know where the package is because it shows me the address where the package is at, can I just go to that address and get my package immediately or I need to wait for the customs and god knows how long. Some said that I need to pay import taxes but I thought that items that are over 2,000,000vnd doesn’t require to pay tax. Does anyone know what to do??? It’s so complicated.

 Hegel was one of a series of German philosophers (including Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Marx) in the 18th and 19th centuries who wrote on the subject of historical and social progress. Speaking very broadly, the idea is something like this: A, society exists in a certain state, with certain rules and traditions and practices. B, the limitations of these rules and traditions and practices prompt a reaction against them. C, the established system and the reaction against it combine to form a new system, informed by both, which then becomes part A of a new cycle. A, ,B and C are often called "thesis", "antithesis" and "synthesis".

 Around the corner from my place is a big bia hơi kinda place, and there are always 3 or 4 guys stood in the road trying to flag people down, waving at them, even jumping in front of bikes from time to time. 
 Of course, I'm well travelled and people trying to stop pedestrians is common all over the world, but vehicles? In my mind, I rarely drive around aimlessly, if I'm on my bike it means I am going somewhere, why would I go into these places on a whim? I have never once seen anyone stop for one of these people, so... What's the point? It's just an annoyance it seems. 
 Maybe I'm missing something but it seems pretty odd.

 Possible points to contemplate:
  
How does English compare with tiếng Việt?
 Are you perchance the first, second, or third of your family line to become fluent English?
 Do you use English with your family?
 Did you have to go overseas to perfect your English?
 Has English skill given you notable opportunities?
 Have you had interesting instructors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I got locked out of my account recently. I tried to contact Momo over the phone but every time it speaks a few sentences and then hangs up automatically. I’ve also emailed them multiple times and they always just say wait 2 business days. It’s been more than a week now. Does anyone know how to reach support, preferably in English? I don’t know any Vietnamese unfortunately. Thanks for all your help!
 Sorry in advance if this type of post is not allowed.

 I see many Vietnamese be able to calculate and sell and do business really well, it just seems like it's a big part of the culture too, to hustle and to work hard on their business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all! I'm currently comparing options for Vietnam tours for late February, 2024. There are two that are extremely similar-- same tour company, similar price, almost identical destinations-- except that one travels to Hoi An and one travels to the Mai Chau Valley. I love visiting historical sites and especially UNESCO World Heritage landmarks, but I've read that Hoi An is very touristy and a bit of a let-down for some Redditors. Mai Chau Valley looks breathtaking and a bit more off the beaten path, but I could use some opinions on it from people who have been there.
 Which of these tours would you pick?

My mom has her original birth certificate from Binh Dinh (pretty old and raggedy at this point lol) and she wants me to find out how to get her dual citizenship/Vietnamese passport. She's been thinking about returning to Vietnam to retire soon and be with her siblings who stayed in Vietnam.
 Any other VK's here done this before? I'd love to get details and specifics - A lot of conflicting information online along with just outright confusing info so it'd be nice to actually hear from others who've done this. 
 I've tried emailing and calling the consulate and embassy in the US as well but they've been surprisingly unhelpful and unresponsive lmao.

 I'm planning to solo travel/ backpack for the first time ever to different countries in SEA in Jan 2024. Preferably starting from 3 Jan - 16 Jan 2024. I'm planning to stay in a hostel. Main point of this trip is to learn new culture, explore amazing cuisines, do fun local activities, meet new people, relax, enjoy, take amazing pictures and create awesome memories!
 I think Sapa & Hanoi in Vietnam would be a great choice! 
 What do you think? Anyone can share with me travel tips or where else I can go in Vietnam in Jan 2024?

Outside of online dating, how did you meet your gf and ex? Are most of them previously your friends, your coworkers, someone you were already familiar with? Or just strangers you bumped into?
 When you're interested in a girl, how do you approach her? My understanding is that you'd ask her out for a coffee, a milk tea, right? How successful were you? How often did you get rejected? If rejected, do you just move on and ask the next girl you're interested in, or do you persist and try again later? Are you usually interested in a lot of girls at once, or just focus on one target?
 If she accepts your invitation for a milk tea, how often did it turn into an official relationship? I mean, is dating supposed to be a numbers game where you repeatedly ask a lot of girls out, repeatedly go out with a lot of girls, just to successfully obtain a gf once in a while (let alone a wife)? I see that most people enter a relationship very easily, so it can't be that tedious, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! ;)
 My Vietnamese fiancée and me (from Germany) will celebrate our wedding in Đà Nẵng next year in early September. We are looking for a band who can perform both Vietnamese songs and English rock/alternative/pop music. We are planning a wedding that will combine both Vietnamese and "Western" traditions - and, of course, our own wishes and visions. 
 We expect around a hundred guests. Most guests will be from Vietnam, but many people from Germany and other nations from around the world will hopefully join. So, it will be wonderful to have people from all over the world to come together, celebrate and connect with one another. We hope a band will be able to play a set before dinner and one afterwards. So, maybe around 3-4 hours in total. Afterwards, we will have a DJ put on some music and we invite the band members to join and celebrate with us. 
 If you or someone you know might be interested, please message me! ;) Looking forward to hear from you!
 All best
 Niko

I am Viet Kieu and can understand and speak Vietnamese. I am trying to learn to read/write in Vietnamese. Out of all the stories that I've heard about, it's very rare that I hear a story from Vietnam. A few months ago, I heard about Dung Hà (Vietnamese female gangster) and found her story quite fascinating. I was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction (YouTube, podcast, websites, books) where I can learn more stories such as this? I'd really appreciate it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I’m an American born Vietnamese who would like to re-learn the language after 20 some odd years of not being fluent.
 My mom re-married after immigrating to America and our household was fully English speaking from the time I was 9 so it sort of fell to the wayside.
 I can listen and comprehend okay (still pretty bad) but my speaking is garbage to put it lightly.
 I’ve tried using duo lingo but I think the dialect is mostly northern whereas my family and friends are from the south so that’s what I would like to focus my learning around.
 Of course I can always speak to my mom now but she’s not really equipped to “teach” it so to speak.
 What are some good resources online? Is it worth it to find a private tutor? I know a few viet friends who learned/perfected their English by watching tv, can the same be said about consuming Vietnamese media with English subtitles? Is that even a thing?
 I think my biggest hurdle is embarrassment/awkwardness when it comes to talking, I lose confidence and don’t want to sound like an idiot so it’s hard to stay consistent.
 Any ideas?

 I was adopted from Hanoi in 1992 and I am currently visiting Vietnam and Hanoi.
 I wanted to show the adoption clinic to my children but neither me nor my parents remember the address(we visited the facility in 2008/2009). I am aware that we need permission to enter the facility but we only want to see the outside.
 The only information I have is that the clinic was called "B clinic" or "Clinic B" back in 1992 and I believe it was still in operation in 2008/2009. However the name can have changed. 
 Any information is of value as we leave Hanoi on the 23rd of December and only have tomorrow to find and visit the facility.
 Thanks in advance!

 Man, woman, 2 small children. Can't recall if the children were helmeted... But left me feeling it's a new milestone.... Rather than Migrant workers coming to vn on their own or possibly in pairs, Migrant families living daily life in the city. It felt real off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[am at the beggining of a motorcycle trip starting in HCMC and aiming to travel in the length of country. I've loved my time here so far and looking forward to the rest of the trip!
 I bought a motorbike in HCMC, a Yamaha T135, which has served me well the first week. However I obviously wasn't thorough enough when inspecting it since I've only just realised the indicators are not orange but blue! I'm pretty sure its the bulbs themselves since the light housing is clear plastic. 
 My question to those in the know - is this illegal? Will I get pulled over by police as I travel from HCMC to Hanoi/Hai Gaing loop?
 I haven't seen any other bikes with coloured indicators so far so a bit worried to be honest

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the Saigon to Sydney flight, at the boarding gate, after security VietJet lies to your face that there is a hundred millilitres restriction on any liquids you have purchased or filled up inside the terminal for flights to Australia
 They don't tell you at check-in either, just with security officers at the boarding gate. So if you've purchased liquids in the terminal they will confiscate them.
 If you ever have the chance, please let them know that they are full of shit, because we just checked with Australian Biosecurity here and they have confirmed that policy is an airline policy even though when you are boarding the plane they claim it is an Australian policy.
 Probably just trying to force you to purchase their cash only in-flight beverages.
 F*** VietJet.
 Edit: To be absolutely clear, we are talking about an additional restriction at the boarding gate, not the normal security check where we all know liquids must be surrendered. This applies to all liquids purchased in the terminal after security screening.

Surely none of them are ever anywhere near capacity? We saw nobody around apart from workers who were mostly just chilling out outside of the gated resorts. Are they laundering projects? The upkeep must be so expensive. Does anyone know what it was like on this stretch of beach before they were all built? Just curious!

 I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. I have read multiple places that Phu Quoc is overdeveloped and does not give you that "island life" feeling. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
  
Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :) Thank you for all answers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the rant. But some of the public colleges and primary-high schools in HCM City keep setting back the GODDAMN TIME in which morning classes start. The old time usually was 7:15 or 7:30am, then it back to 7am, and now it become 6:45am (Some schools like HCMC University of Industry and Trade set to as early as 6:30am)
 When asked about this decision, 2 of the most popular answers from the school speaker are: - To avoid heavy traffic --> They seriously thought "If the traffic is usually jammed at 7am, then why don't we just start the school at 6:45am?". To me, this is such a dangerous one-sided thinking, which disregard students whose houses are very far from school. Doesn't even mention student now even have less time for breakfast anymore if they wake up at 6 o'clock or later. Plus, people who don't want to deal with heavy traffic are already aware to get up early, you don't need to force everyone has to go more earlier, as long as they go to school before it starts.
  
To prevent student from coming late to class and to encourage them to wake up early--> There is no scientific research stated that the earlier the school start, the lower the student coming to school late. School in US and Europe begin at atleast 8 am so student can have good sleep, which they've done countless researches before. Again, dangerous one-sided thinking to me. As a grad student, I have twice to tripple amount of assignments despite sleeping less comparing to my time in high school. From my experience, it encourages more people to go to class late lol. My friends said this is dumb, and they ended up always going late or only go to second class (8:30 - 10:10am).
  
Sorry if you find this rant and broken English annoying. I'm 2nd year grad student and I'm tired of waking up in 5am so that I can take buses in 5:40 to get to school in time. The reason I wrote this post so I can relieve some stress from constant complaining against my school. Hope you forgive me.

Also, my roommate/best friend is getting married so I'm feeling a bit lonely idk 😕 About me: I play games but not so good with it, just average I think (LoL, Valorant, CSGO, DST, overcooked etc.). LGBT+ friendly and open minded (I do know that some ppl do claim that they're but they actually dont but this is what ppl around comment about me so I think its reliable 😂). I'm not so good with recommending cool food places cuz I mostly order food to my house 🥲 Good hidden bars, coffee shops yeah I can do. I read manga and watch anime too but wouldnt say I know many good ones. I draw as a side hobbies, not so much recently but yeah I do love art. Have tattoos, I can recommend some good tattoo artists that I mainly go to here. I have depression, anxiety, bipolar and a bit of adhd (thats a lot isnt it 🤡) but Im highly self aware and well put together most of the time. Last but not least 😂 I'm a libra.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a white guy visiting my wife’s family in a pretty rural part of Vietnam. Our sleeper bus stopped on the way and I went in to use the urinal taking the first empty one (there was probably 50 urinals mostly empty). Some guy comes in right after me and takes the urinal right next to me, then proceeds to just stare over the divider at my junk very obviously for a good 20 seconds. It was very obvious since he peaked his entire head over the divider multiple times. Eventually I gave up on peeing and left to use a stall cause I felt too uncomfortable. Any advice on what I should do in that situation? Do you say something or just walk away like I did? Is this common?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is not the right place to post this but I just want to get this off my chest to s community like this. For some context I was born in Hanoi and adopted into a US family at 8 months old - I have nothing as far of information regarding my parents, just my birthday and where I was found abandoned. I got the chance to visit Vietnam for the first time in 16 years since I was born last month. I got to experience the city and the wonderful people and I got to go to my orphanage. I got back to the US just 2 weeks ago and I just miss Vietnam so much - part of it just feels like home to me and I just miss the whole vibe and general culture of the country. I have never traveled to a place where I just felt so in place and “normal” with people who were genuinely interested in me and cared about me. It honestly was an experience nice and feeling that I really cannot put into words. I am not normally a person to express my emotions like this but I just had to get it out somehow sorry this was more of a post about my feelings and more about myself 😅. Anyways thanks for reading - sending love ❤️.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrived at Tan Son Nhat and called a GrabCar to my hotel in District 1 since it was 100k vnd opposed to the 300k-400k vnd quoted by the taxi stands.
 After a few minutes trying to find my driver in the parking lot at the Arrivals exit, he helped load my full size luggage and medium totebag into the trunk while I carried my pet carrier with me into the back seat.
 About 5 minutes into the ride, the driver motions a hand gesture towards his tummy and realize he is trying to say he has a stomach ache and needs to find a restroom en route. He gets on his phone and coordinates with another driver to take me in their car instead. We stop at a gas station, and I get out with my pet carrier and begin to get into the other car. My driver opens the trunk to retrieve my luggage, closes the trunk lid right away and holds up a 100k bill to show me as he hands it to the new driver. I am in agreement as it seems fine with the exchange of funds to the new driver, and I pay the first driver once my ride completes.
 As I am about to enter the new car, I realize I am missing my large totebag. I tell my original driver, hey I'm missing my other bag. So I go over to the car and he opens the trunk and reaches in and retrieves my totebag. I see the totebag is placed in the trunk in a small, recessed area that just seemed odd. I didn't think much of all this at first, but at the end of the day, this incident has kept me thinking I was trying to be robbed. My totebag contained all my essential items.
 tldr: grabcar drivers says he is sick minutes into a ride, gets me a replacement car and driver and forgets to transfer all my luggage to new car.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I visited Vietnam for the first time this summer and I loved it! So now I am coming back from the 31.Dec until the 12. Jan. I am starting in HCM and end in Hanoi. I was just wondering what the best places are in early January considering Hanoi is a bit colder? So just a couple of questions:
  
Is Hoi an good in January? Some say its rainy season and others say its a good time to visit. I really enjoyed Hoi an, and a little rain does not bother me. What is the temperature like?
 Is Con Dao a good place? What is the weather like and is 2 days enough? Its a small island but i rather want something smaller than Phu Quoc. Is there enough to do on Con Dao
 Are there other places in southern VietNam that has beaches and is hot in January? (easy to get to from HCM)
 Any suggestions regarding things to do or places to visit during early January are appreciated :)
  
Thank you for all answers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I sorta want to learn to read and write chữ nôm, and that would requite me to learn Chinese. What dialect would I learn? Before the arrival of the Jesuits and French, Vietnamese was written in chữ nôm, which were Chinese characters modified to write Vietnamese. In order to read and write this script, one probably had to have a good understanding of Chinese. But what dialect of Chinese did chữ nôm writers speak? It probably was not Mandarin, as that was spoken in northern China, ~2000 miles away from Vietnam. Chinese rule of Vietnam ended in the 10th century, so there must have been some drift in the Chinese dialect the literate Vietnamese knew and the dialects the Chinese spoke.

I want to start from the end and say that ultimately nothing happened to us, and we continue to enjoy our trip here.
 My partner and I are visiting Vietnam and we are currently in Hanoi. Last evening we were walking around the Hoàn Kiếm area, when at some point a man seemed to have offered us something (I did not hear/understand). I have simply politely responded "no thanks" and my partner and I continued walking. From that point, I could see from the corner of my eye he was walking behind us. We did not interact further. At some point, he passed us and was now ahead of us by a few steps. Whenever we stopped (to look at our map, cons…]]></summary>

 Do you think it's impossible in my case to get a job in Vietnam? What about the visa?
 I am a French Software developer with 3 years of experience, both in France and Germany.
 I am fluent in English and French. I know that recruitment policies rightfully prioritize locals, but I would appreciate your opinion about this topic! or even some feedbacks.
 Thanks for your answers :)

I'm not accusing the entire sub of being these stereotypers as most of the replies are level-headed, but there are still some things I just wanna get off my chest as a non-native who was raised in Vietnam.
  
The accusations of racism.
  
Whilst it is true that Vietnam is a racist country, I find it absolutely ridiculous that people seem to be stereotyping the entire nation as being racists. I myself whilst not exactly dark skinned, have seen a lot of darker skinned Viets living life normally. Matter of fact- a big majority of Viets are tanned, regardless of class.

On the way, we see a bike lying on the side of the road. I immediately stop and see two kids (maybe 17-18) lying there in a puddle of blood. I stop the bike, jump off, and run over to them and notice that one kid has two huge holes in his head and his face is completely covered in blood. The other kid is alright, just a scratch across his face from the pavement, but visibly shocked trying to shake his friend. Some people are standing in the distance just looking, while his head is lying on the side of the road.
 I hold his head up, his blood is pouring all over me. I try to wave to people passing by, and every single person stops, looks, shrugs, and keeps going. Not a sin…]]></summary>

 I have tried drugs pretty much from every class. Weed, traditional psychedelics, stimulants, dissociatives and sedatives. I have experience with relatively high dose of shrooms and LSD, also with vaping and smoking DMT. I'm familiar with the feeling those all share to some extent. I have done high dose of edible cannabis multiple times too.
 Tonight I was alone in a bar in Vietnam and a guy asked me to join their table. I joined them and we enjoyed some beer and tried to have a conversation even though they didn't really speak english. They had a shisha on the table and offered it for me and I smoked it few times. It was my first time doing shisha, everything seemed just normal, it tasted like mellow strawberry.

 I know it sounds weird, but I figure other tourists have tshirts (which I do as well), but buying a jacket is unique, and it really reminds me of being in Vietnam.
 My friend is refusing to help me look for a BE jacket this time; he says it’s the “uniform of the poor”.
 So, I’m on my own on this endeavour. How would I buy one, despite not being able to speak Vietnamese?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in vietnam for over 2 weeks now and I've been really depressed about the racism I'm facing here. To give some context, I'm chinese and indian, quite dark skinned, female. 
 The counts of racism I've faced here is absolutely disheartening, maybe because of my background, I tend to notice the implicates of it. Other - I've been really well behaved, trying to break the misconceptions about my countrie(s) not because I deliberately want to, but because that's how I am. I'm introverted, am always polite, tip well, do not indulge in the bad stuff. 
  
At the hotel I was in, I saw white tourists get upgraded and also an Asian Australian man get upgraded (their original rooms were not available). In my case I was asked to wait 3 hours for my room, when I asked if I could pay for a better room, they happily obliged. This happened on the same day, around the same time. 
 
Customer service - Specually in hotels again, I saw how other customers were treated over me. Unfortunately, I did notice a theme going around with the skin tone. I saw a couple who came in after me order much more elaborate dishes, it was only after they finished almost eating, was I served my very simple dish. 
 
The cherry on top, I took a tour to a popular tourist guide with a English speaking tour guide, he went on to speak about how brown skin is not considered beautiful in vietnam, that it's ugly, relates to poor and bad behavior as he himself was brown, he did not have good experiences in vietnam with his love life, job etc.. this really broke my heart. This country is supposed to have the kindest of people, having read the previous threads too, I didn't expect to have this experience in Vietnam of all places. 
 
 I just wanted to share this with all the people of colour who keep asking this question if the vietnamese are racist. Here's your answer. Ofcourse, it's not as blatant, or direct, but hurtful nonetheless.

 I’d love to hear if you guys have other tips for us on our situation. Thanks!

 I m european and i will travel to Vietnam by plane to sign on container vessel, i m a seafarer. I have in my checked luggage a 2.5kg sealed bag containing GymBeam True Whey ( protein powder ). One friend of my father scared me and told me that custom agents are very corrupt and if they see that I m european, they will demand money and if i refuse they will even go far as replacing my protein powder with some drugs to convict and jail me. 
 I told him that he s crazy but now i m a bit worried. Can i take my protein with me or should i leave home. I would probably come by plane from Instanbul or Doha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, first of all, I'm a Vietnamese. Using English here, because well, why the hell not?
 University in this nation just feels forced. Not like "conscription" stuff but, keeps organizing random events and forces students to participate, and if not, deduct bunch of "diem ren luyen" or whatever. I just feel like students should have the rights to whether to go or not. Like recently, my university had some sort of Shoppe-sponsored event and of course, to make the sponsors happy, they force every students to attend, standing in the sun for 1 hour then listen to annoying love-related songs about bunch of "I love you then you dump me" non-sense. Or forcing students to clean up construction debris in the university. Wow, unpaid working. 10/10, Law university. And upcoming, another sport event that if they didn't threaten to deduct points, probably no one would attend because 90% of the students aren't bothered to wake up at 8AM in Sunday, just to watch bunch of fellow university students playing badmintons and running.
 I understand the morality behind the non-sense of that points system, for "đánh giá về phẩm chất chính trị, đạo đức, lối sống của sinh viên trên năm mặt đánh giá" but using this so that the teachers can prove that "my university organizes events and the students are totally not enforced to come and this will do very well for publicity" is not really a good excuse to use this points system. Because some university students have their own life to deal with and should not be forced to participate in events that for a lack of better words, they don't give a f- about (there're defo better words). Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Students have their own life and you having free time doesn't mean you should torture the students.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to vietnam next week and I went to search up on items to declare while clearing the customs. One of the items is cash.
 Apparently vietnam customs allow you to bring $5000USD or equivalent foreign currencies in cash without a need to declare. But for their own currency, they only allow travellers to bring in 15million VND which is $620USD equivalent. Anymore than 15million VND in cash has to be declared. That is so weird? Anyone has any experience of bringing in more than 15million dongs in vietnam? Do you actually need to declare? If you did, what did they do? Do they just straight up confiscate the difference?
 Edit: People seem confused so I’ll explain further: 
 Guys I am talking about arrivals. Not departure. I’m BRINGING IN 30million dong cash to vietnam to SPEND. I’m NOT BRINGING VND OUT of vietnam. I dont understand why would they limit the bringing of their currency that’s the most legal and accepted to be used in their country so severely. It’s like they are trying to create more business for the money changers there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it just me or have you noticed the same. It seems to me that the driving style in Vietnam seems to be slower then for example in Thailand or the west. I don’t know how to describe it. I felt the same in Laos. Some sort of socialist driving style. Maybe it is also because there are so many motorcycles and most look identical. What’s your take on it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can there be widespread development and well-being in a socialist country like Vietnam?
 Vingroup seems to me to be the classic case of parastatal corruption. They promised to build homes for the people by converting rural areas but then built luxury homes that are inaccessible and currently empty. 
 It seems to me that in VN no one cares about voting and that all they have faith in the government. 
 It seems to me to be a country destined to become a new China if the people do not demand democracy and the fight against corruption. 
 At today we never saw a country without democracy grow up with a stable well-being and in my opinion VN people they need to fight more for their rights.
 What do you think? Why Vietnamese trust this gov?

Outpatient treatment 
 Inpatient treatment 
  Medical evacuation to my home country 
 Repatriate remains
  
Is outpatient coverage necessary here as treatment in Vietnam is super cheap? 
 How long should the waiting period for cancer or illnesses? Some insurance companies have a 12 month waiting period for cancer which is ridiculous in my opinion. 
 Thank you so much

We were thinking of taking the train up the coast and stopping off at Sapa, Nha Trang, Hue, and still deciding. We like to adventure, eat good food, and not be in touristy scenes if possible! Where we else should we definitely stop and where have you stayed that you enjoyed? Ok with private rooms in hostels, hotels, other unique experiences. Should we book ahead of time or wait til we get there? Thank you 💞💞💞

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been here for a while now and I am honestly SO tired of being misled by top tier hotel reviews online that turn out to be rigged or fake. Every “well-reviewed” hotel or accommodation (even higher end ones) I’ve stayed in was so terrible (or subpar at best) despite raving reviews online which leads me to believe it’s all fake and manipulated. 
 Then, whenever you leave an honest review or comment on booking.com or google that isn’t a 9 or 10, hotel staff will literally track you down on your personal whatsapp or e-mail to emotionally blackmail you urging you to delete or edit your comment, or worse! They will even threaten you! 
 Pictures on websites are insanely misleading too and idk why but staff always give off this insanely fake vibe with weird fabricated personas they sport because they they think this somehow pleases tourists? (Spoiler: IT DOES NOT, everything just feels pretty off and not genuine at all).
 All very exhausting. I’m leaving Vietnam soon and couldn’t be happier to leave this all behind me. 
 Sorry I just had to rant for a moment after countless disappointing experiences.

 Everything I read on this sub looks delicious. Just any tips on what I should do are appreciated. I’m not just going to eat pho or Bahn Mi. Things with fresh herbs and noodles/soups are interesting to me. I like spice and not American guy spicy. I don’t need to eat meat with everything. 
 I have a weekend to explore. Thanks I appreciate it.

 I’ve done it so you don’t have to :)
 Turns out every shop has slightly different prices on Apple products.
 ShopDunk has both the lowest prices AND provide tax certificate so you can get your further 10% off at the airport.
 I paid 9.9M VND for an Apple Watch S9. After tax rebate it’s 9M, about 25% cheaper than I’d pay for it in the UK.
 iPhone 15 works out at around £800, so 20% cheaper than in the UK.
 As far as I can tell there shouldn’t be any regional differences in hardware or software, albeit Apple warranty isn’t international as far as I can tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a foreigner, I wish to get the general perspective of Northerners and Southerners. I have lived in Hanoi 7 years and had spent 8 months full time last year in Saigon. As the title suggests, I am genuinely curious as to why? Granted Saigon has been renamed as Ho Chi Minh City, and some suggested it some sort of a reminder to everyone. Is this really the case? I also met people who still refer to the city as Saigon. 
 It does not mean I don't see him in Hanoi, just not as much as in Ho Chi Minh City.

 She gets upset about things to do with her parents back home in veitnam, but when I ask about them, I get told not to worry about them. 
 Been with her for nearly 2 years, and married since January. I could understand the general secrecy if it were a relatively new relationship, and kind of has expectations that the secrecy would kinda die off after a few months, but it never did.
 There's a whole bunch if questions, that I could never get answers from her on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question
 Why do so many Vietnamese feel the need to come right next to you when there are so many other spaces. 
 Example: - I'll be in a cafe that is totally empty and a noisy Vietnamese family with kids come in. There's a 99% guarantee that out of all the empty tables, they'll choose to come and sit right next to me.
  
Motorbike parking will be totally empty but I can guarantee someone will park their bike right next to mine (and bang my mirrors while doing so)
 
I'll go to the park to relax while it is mostly quiet. Despite being empty, the one group of Vietnamese will almost definitely come and sit right near me. 
 
 Is it a deep rooted fear of being alone or just a desire to piss off other people? (Joke)
 The urinal meme has never been more true.

This morning I was getting a train in hcmc and wanted to double check everything was okay with my ticket there was someone getting help when I arrived at the customer service desk and 2 people behind me so very clearly in a line and an older man walked infront of me and then after that it happened again with another older man. Being from the UK and how we queue this is seen as being very rude but is it a common thing here?

 I like my public hospital. It is cheaper than the private hospitals. 
 I recently bought cheap private insurance here in Vietnam and they rejected my claim. 
 The sales rep for that insurance lied to me about my insurance coverage. Due to my budget, I had to buy this private insurance. 
 My current insurance company will not cover for pre-existing conditions. 
 My employer only gives me accident insurance. They do not give me health insurance which sucks. 
 I do not drive. 
 Outpatient is cheap here. 
 My budget is tight so I wanr to save as much money as possible. 
 I am wondering if public health insurance is enough. 
 Do I need to still buy private insurance in addition to public health insurance? 
 Thanks!

 Now that I’m adult and traveling to Da Nang I’d like to buy some. I don’t care for them to be tailored, it’s just a pj. I’m looking for a nightgown, short and tank top set, and maybe a robe. And maybe some gold jewelry if it is affordable.
 Are there shops I can buy this already made? Any store/address recommendations? Even if I go to Hoi An, I only have time for one day so they would have to make it same day by 7pm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day, I found on the Internet such a thing as Autoblow Ultra. I want to try it out, but they say on the Internet that legally a thing of this nature will not be allowed through customs, otherwise you won’t end up with problems. Has anyone already encountered similar “problems” and is there a way to get the desired item while in Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know Vietnamese are pragmatic and that chữ quốc ngữ is way more practical for everyday use, learning and teaching. Nevertheless, I wonder how the Vietnamese state, the society and individual are interested in their Vietnamese cultural heritage. Do people offer it at school like how many western nations may also offer to teach a dead language like latin? Do people use it for modern poems and literature?
 What I personally love about Chinese style characters isn't just the aesthetics, but the connection and meaning that each character holds. They don't just decorate the temples and literature of the past. For example, did you knew that the family name Ngô 吳 does not refer to maize/corn 玉米 , which is also called ngô in Vietnamese? I did not for a long time. I think the usage of Chinese characters can make some differentiation in phonetically same sounding words and its kinda neat.
 I also find concepts and attempts like Quốc âm tân tự and chữ Nôm mới very interesting.

 I'm wondering how expats living in Vietnam handle their health insurance?
 I am moving to Vietnam soon for work (my employer does not provide health coverage), and I plan to take out some travel insurance initially to cover any accidents or emergencies, and then find a health insurance plan provider after I arrive. Not sure if this it the best way of doing it though.
 Does anyone have any recommendations or advice? I'm interested to hear how you insure yourself and which providers you recommend.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had the worst train experience in my whole life. I and my friend went to buy the bunk beds for our 7 hour trip. The toilets are too filthy as they pissed all over it and there is not enough space, it likes you are locked inside a cramped closet with piss filled every fucking corner. The train shaked and as it stopped it almost made me fall into those piss filled corner in the toilet. The noise I could endure but there was a family with little kids who kept kicking the wall during the night. The staff smuggled people so they can charge 10$ per bunk bed while when we officially bought the tickets it was 30$ per seat. As we only bought 2 seats, the 10$ illegal bought beds above us hung their feets right above our head, kicking in the beds so we could not sleep for the whole night. And the train staff, seeing that we realized she smuggled people onto the train and felt we bought our beds so she couldn't make anymore money, treated us as garbage and was being rude the whole ride. I doubt they ever change their attitude or service so I won't ever get on a train in Vietnam for my long ride anymore. It was not worth it. I was very tired and both disgusted and angry with suck an awful train service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was walking around Saigon exploring random convenience stores in Tan Dinh and D3 between meetings, and noticed how most western branded goods are priced almost as much (if not more than) as they would sell in the US. 
 ​
 Products like Cerave, Cetaphil, St Ives, etc are all priced at US levels, which is something I've never seen in other Asian countries. In China or India, Unilever or P&G would try to match local prices, but in VN they are completely unabashed in price gouging. 
 ​
 While I do understand that these would be luxury products for most Vietnamese, this is the first time I've ever seen this lack of price localization almost anywhere in the developing world.

 This is an old performance by someone who is not Vietnamese. The caption is in Russian, but I was able to translate it via Google Translate. The part pertaining to the lyrics state that she sings the following:
 "It’s wonderful to love like this in the spring, when the expanse of fields blooms. The valleys turn green again, the nightingale captivates with the song. Leave me, leave me, I’m in a hurry to go to the market. I won’t hide it, I love you, but it’s a pity I can’t stay... "
 The caption goes on to say that the song was created it back in 1957, when the performer participated in a tour of Vietnam as part of a delegation of Soviet art masters. It states that she is wearing the national costume donated to her by the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture.
 I am curious if the song is accurate. Is she really singing in Vietnamese? I don't know enough to be able to tell myself. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 So I’m in VN for a few months and don’t have much friends yet with similar interests. I do love going to experimental music places and raves back in Europe. Something that I would do with friends mainly and also alone. I’m born European and so know the culture and social codes even in underground spaces.
 So now that I’m on my own here in VN for ths first time ever, I found a bunch of parties I would like to attend, at locations for example: The Observatory, Arcan and The Bar Commune Lab.
 Now all my europe friends are like ‘you should NOT go alone,cause its dangerous to do things alone as a cute female in a third world country’ and in the meanwhile all my friends who are from south east asia themselves, that I met in Europe, are excited for me te explore on my own in VN and make new friends by just showing up here.
 So, what do yall think? Can I go around on my own? Ofcourse a lot of basic female going out things apply like, dont accept drinks from strangers and stuff but idk, I dont feel like Vietnam is that unsafe and these spaces seem experienced when it comes to internationality?
 My viet language is super beginner tho..

 I was talking to my coworker about houses in China, and he said that Ho Chi Minh District 1's prices are ridiculous, given that for the same price (let's say 500k), you could buy a 1500 sqft house in let's say, Columbia MD, where many people agree is a good place to live.
 Or a 3000 sqft house in Sugarland TX, which let's face it, is amongst the best values for money in America given you get a top rated school system (according to USNews), being in a rich and educated community, and having quite good weather rather than hot/humid weather even in the winter and tropical diseases.

 I was searching for Phu Quoc but came across some threads saying it's all fake and overpriced (?). Do you recommend it or not?
 I'm not looking for party or busy places, just something chill, where I can walk to some beaches, have a beer and maybe rent a bike to explore the surroundings.
 Alternatives are destinations like Phuket but it seems the weather is not so good there now.
 The only thing to keep in mind is that I need to work, so good wifi is mandatory.
 Really appreciate your help. Thanks!

I am currently riding from HCMC to Hanoi and rented a bike from Tigit. They have an interesting option where one can rent a guide for $140 a day (plus all expenses for the guide). I was maybe thinking if anyone would want to join, we could split the cost of the guide and have our own smaller tour. This would not be an "easy-rider" situation and you would have to ride your own bike. Tigit also rents bikes and gear for a fee. Link below for the guide. Thank you.
