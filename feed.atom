 First time travelling to Vietnam. My partner and I are currently in Hanoi and loving it. We are heading on down to Ho Chi Minh in a couple of weeks. It'll be my girlfriend's birthday when we are there and i really want to give her a special day.
 Any recommendations on things to do, restaurants to eat at (shes vegetarian btw) etc etc ??
 Staying in District 1 so preferably walking distance or not too far from this
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, for few months back i started to grow some passions about cinema, and i would like to go for University of Theater and Cinema, but since the date to apply already concluded.
 I have a dream to become a small director, to do a small project, some short films about my life or making a big one with the size compare to cinema. I wanted to brought our country's film to a next level, maybe everyone are also like me, but i feel it.
 In Ho Chi Minh, is there any training center or other College i can learn to be one, from the techniques to using cameras, edits,... So i can know the details in every part once i making the film, now i'm already starting to develop some scripts which i think it could tell something, might just a crap but it is what i love.
 I can't thank you enough for this

 I heard this was common for ppl who are Vietnamese and entering into the country. 
 Is this still normal? If so, how much cash should I bring?

Is this true? How does it work? I trust my boyfriend but I don’t trust the strangers that could possibly spike his drink and I’m uncomfortable about the fact that they’ll have sexy women keeping him company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnam is in my bucket list for a long time. This big country cannot be explode in 7 days so I have decided that I will travel and in between I have to work. 1. If I take a tourist sim card with 5G is it enough to connect my laptop and work ? Mostly IT work in Google Chrome and some software. No video upload etc. 2. Which sim card to take for this 30 day plan ? 3. I see lot of buses operate in cities. Are these AC buses, operate on time ? (Or like Indian buses. No schedule). 4. For travel between cities how early I need to book train/bus ticket ? Which website can I use to book ? 5. Any concern on snatching/pickpocketing? 6. My plan is saigon - DMZ - da nang/hoi an / hue - Hanoi - ninh bin - cat ba island. Is it ok or shall I add something? Exit from Hanoi airport. Max I can spend 3 to 4 weeks. In between I have to work full days :( 7. I don't speak vietnemese at all. Will there be issue with ordering food with street food vendor? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Da Nang has been showing me so many new things. Around ~9-9:15pm on Cầu Rồng, there was a bunch of motorbikes speeding (like i have never seen vehicles go this fast in Vietnam's big cities) down the bridge with guys on the back whipping belts out. Eventually, one guy is on the ground with his bike knocked down, getting beaten with belts. The perps take off, leaving the guy curled up in fetal position. This all happened in the middle of moving traffic.
 I guess....WTF??? I'm assuming this is a one-off but seems very bold to be doing it so publicly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I'm looking for some interesting documentaries to learn more about the country and culture. Unfortunately mostly when searching the only ones that come up are war related, for which I have no interest in rehashing. Ideally I'd like to find content thats more in depth on the culture, not just random tourism focused stuff.
 Any recommendations would be appreciated. Likewise if there are any better news/current affairs publications beyond VNexpress/TuoiTre that would also be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about this statement. None of my Vietnamese friends have been able to give me a concrete answer yet...
 Why is it that every conversation I have with older folks here (male or female) seems to go in the exact same direction? How long you been here? What is your job? How old are you? Are you married? NO?! Then they insist I marry a Vietnamese woman.
 Sometimes it's a quick, lighthearted suggestion but then other times it's a full on sales pitch. One old man told me that he likes the look of western women, but they don't age well like Vietnamese women do so I best take up a Vietnamese wife... which I found very funny. 
 So why do you guys think this happens? People seem so passionate about suggesting it to me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am aware of the fact that this is a common problem among every community but it seems really ridiculous in Vietnam. Whenever I play a game, I often stumble upon Vietnamese with hard swears as their username, and they're often pretty toxic. I was playing this game about tanks, we lost the match because a guy on our team was afk. I notified the enemy team of his position and that's when this guy, with the most original username ever, (Ditmemay12) starts to unleash his tantrum on me. He told me to shut up, I'm like what? The afk guy was the only one left on our team so I wanted to get this over with. What was he trying to do? Show his typing skills? Show how much of a failure he has become? (Btw the guy sucks at the game). It's not the first time I have seen such behaviours, it's everywhere. On Facebook, Discord, etc. Any social media platform that has Vietnamese. Again, I know it's a common problem and those people does not represent the entirety of he Vietnamese community. But I feel like those kinds of people take up a hefty percentage of the community. Have anyone gotten the same experience as me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have been staying in Hanoi for a week already and we are staying the next three weeks. We’ve been getting by using google translate and common sense and so far he’s tried a wide variety of Vietnamese food without a reaction. Seems like a lot of food uses soy oil so far. He carries epi pens with him.
 However, people are often confused by the translated message and we think it’s not clear. 
 Using google translate from English to viet to English, “no nuts, no sesame” returns as “no seeds. Unseasoned” which isn’t helpful at all hahaha.
 Also nuts can translate to peanuts but he is allergic to all nuts and nut oils. Sesame also seems to have multiple translations.
 A translation of something like “I can’t eat nuts, nut oils, sesame, sesame oil. Does this food contain them?” would be ideal! :D 
 thank you for any help!!
 Edit If you’re interested hes only eating a small bite of food then waiting 5-10 mins for a reaction to be safe. if he reacted he would make himself throw it up. He also has tablets and 4 epi pens. He’s also a med student.

 I'm planning on flying into Ho Chi Minh city, spending a couple of nights, then I want to make the trek up to Hanoi. Does anyone have suggestions on how to do this, and what the most interesting path might be? Also is it safe to travel alone or are there some sketchy parts I should avoid?
 Ideally I'd love to rent a motorcycle and ride up myself... but I've never ridden a motorcycle or driven in Asia so scratch that idea. Is there some kind of boat I can take, or something? I'd love to make my way up to Hanoi over the course of 5-6 days and see as much of Vietnam as I can.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 My (23 F) boyfriend (23 M) is from HCM city and moved to America one year ago. We’ve been dating for over six months and the relationship has gotten serious.
 I love him (surprisingly, his family also loves me) and it’s looking like things might end in marriage down the line. I’m amazed they accept me so easily when my family doesn’t accept him, but I try my best anyway. His family wants everyone to live together someday soon. My boyfriend says no.
 My boyfriend has a rebellious spirit. His cousin bought me VN government-issued textbooks to study the language, but he doesn’t want to teach me Vietnamese manners. It leads to awkward situations with his family A LOT. He says “just be yourself, it’s America!” but I want his family’s approval.
 His parents were very poor in VN and are very traditional. My family is rich and has more advanced manners than average Americans. I grew up with my grandparents too, so I act and dress more like an older lady. It’s funny because sometimes I act like a polite American to his parents and they say to my boyfriend “she has Vietnamese manners, nice”. I’m totally uneducated but I know I offend them a little sometimes. 
 For example, he didn’t tell me I should offer his parents to eat before I eat their food. Things like that. 
 Please, if anyone has information on how not to offend Vietnamese parents, tell me. I never dress provocatively or curse, and I try to be as helpful as possible in the kitchen. My boyfriend’s family gives me a lot of patience as a westerner, but I want to do the right thing.
 Thank you 💗

I have a big extended family with 10 uncles and aunties, and a small immediate family with a single mom and a big older brother (we are 18 years old apart). I grew up without a father, and he’s around somewhere in this country, just not around in any form. My family is very respectful, and I am very proud of them. My mother is a strong woman who went through a lot of things to raise me …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Really embarrassed to talk about this. I’m not looking for sympathy. I just wanted to warn other travellers about this.
 I’m a foreigner from London. Have been using a dating app here. I noticed there are some girls on the app who are very eager to meet right away and go for a drink. Stupidly, I agreed to go with one this evening.
 She told me to meet her around the corner from Sniff club. Met her, looked nothing like her photos (which hardly showed her face anyway). She led us to this club.
 She didn’t even speak English and we communicated via google translate…
 She said she wanted to drink champagne 🤦🏼‍♂️ so I bought a bottle. Then she asked if she can do some balloons, and kept asking for more and more. At one point she suggested I tip the bar staff. 
 She was super flirty and touching me all over. Until I said no to more balloons she acted like a grumpy child.
 I noticed some girls who were waiting on the corner, who later on were in the same club with some foreigner men.
 I am quite sure these girls are employed by the club to get men to come in and spend money. My total bill was 5 million…
 It’s a sad feeling to be taken advantage of like this. Everyone I’ve met so far has been so kind and generous to me.
 So yea, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is!

 She has the money to get them done in the US but refuses because she wants to save money.
 My extended family is advising her to get them done in the US to avoid complications and is pressuring me to convince her. They said the dentists in Vietnam are incompetent and that if she were to have issues with the dentures, she will have to get them redo in the States which will cost even more money. 
 I understand both sides of the argument. I’m unsure what to tell my mom 
 Can you guys share your thoughts on this matter?

Natural disasters (PH has tons of typhoons, ID has lots of earthquakes although tbh I hardly notice those)
 Shit politics that drive you insane
 Expensive X (in PH food is overpriced AF, in Indonesia, electronic are overpriced AF)
 Terrible commute to the office if you can't walk it
  
Hardly anything shocks me. I just go with the flow and accept the bad stuff or ignore it when possible.
 BUT of course, some things can be dealbreakers.
 I'm not in PH right now only because I lost my home in the Philippines during COVID and at this point, I'm not too sure to go back. It's a long and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a particular marketing team, there is a supervisor who holds the same number of years of work experience as the other team members but demonstrates less competence. It is evident to everyone in the office that the supervisor is the CEO's favorite employee. Whenever the CEO makes an insensitive joke, if the supervisor reacts poorly, the CEO apologizes. However, if anyone else in the team reacts negatively, the CEO calls them out, expressing dissatisfaction with their response.
 Interestingly, it was the supervisor who recently fired a colleague, but the CEO publicly supported the decision, attributing it to himself. This situation suggests that the CEO is protecting the supervisor by taking responsibility for the dismissal. This lack of transparency creates an unbalanced power dynamic within the office. After the incident, the office became dull.
 Moreover, the supervisor constantly seeks to know what others are doing, including questioning their work methods. This behavior can be bothersome, especially when team members are competent and experienced. For instance, one team member was surprised when the supervisor asked for assistance with a basic marketing task, such as scheduling social media posts. It is disconcerting when someone in an executive role lacks knowledge of fundamental marketing tools.
 These observations raise my concerns about power dynamics within the team. The supervisor appears to be favored, even with her limited competence, while others are held to a different standard. Additionally, the CEO's protection of the supervisor and the supervisor's micromanagement tendencies suggest an abuse of power.

 I’m flying to Tokyo on Monday and I found a good deal on vietjet that departs at 11:20pm from HCMC. 
 Is this airline reliable? I don’t want to show up and it 4 hours late or cancelled altogether. Does anyone have any experience flying this airline?
 Thanks.

I’m American and the only way I’ve seen this game played prior is with an Ace being valued only as either 1 or 11. Is this normally how Vietnamese play or do they have their own rules for the game? I’d appreciate any feedback.

Two days ago i woke up with this mark after sleeping in a hotel room in Vietnam (Nortern region). I didn't notice it until i saw it in the mirror but now it has become more irritated (probably because of the friction with my clothes). I don't know how i got it, what it is and how to take care of it. It's on my ribcage and is about 3 cm in hight, the redness has spread over time.
 First two pictures are current, third is what it looked like in the beginning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I notice that many businesses in Vietnam use Facebook as their "only" web presence. And either Facebook Messenger, Zalo, or Telegram as the "only " chat app to allow their prospective clients to reach them.
 If you don't have an active facebook account, you can't view their content freely. Facebook would keep on pestering you to login. ( I regularly face this problem. )
 Many businesses have websites, but instead of a regular inbuilt chat feature, there would be either Facebook Messenger, Zalo or Telegram. If you don't have one of these apps ; you can't contact them. ( My personal experience for 3 years) 
 Does it ever occur to them that how many businesses they lose because of this limitation? Why not give multiple options to their clients? Why force them to download a new chat app?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was recently travelling in Southeast Asia and I was shocked by the behaviour of people (especially Vietnamese) regarding trash and plastic. I saw so many people (young and old) simply throwing their trash onto the street: people eating chips and dropping the bag in the sidewalk, a man putting deodorant and tossing it to the middle of the road, plastic bottles, bags, cans of drinks… basically litter everywhere. 
 This is particularly disturbing in big cities like Hanoi and Saigon, which are apparently developed and everyone has a phone and internet, but no one seems to have environmental awareness about reducing and recycling their waste.
 I can understand that old habits die hard and older people continue doing that, but the younger ones seem to follow that path as well. 
 Also, the amount of plastic is insane. Is there really a need to get a drink in a plastic cup, inside a plastic bag, sealed with a plastic lid and drink it from a plastic straw? Even if you drink it on the spot and not take away, they will still put the plastic lid with a machine. On top of that, after finishing the drink, all that plastic ends up being dumped on the street.
 I’m no environmental “freak” or entitled European, but I’m genuinely curious if this is an issue being addressed by Vietnamese people (in schools, public campaigns) or if they simply don’t care. Has there been any improvement in recent years? Do you think there will be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào! What are nice spots/mountains for hiking in Vietnam? When I was there a few months ago, I was kinda disappointed. Not by the landscape and nature but rather by the accessibility and availability of tracks. I went hiking near Da Lat and Phan Thiet, which was great, but although the north is a lot more mountainous, they were barely accessible due to dense forests and lack of paths. Sometimes there was "too easy" access, which attracts tourists (e.g., viewpoint in Ninh Binh). Ofc Fansipan is an option but I'd rather do the tour by myself without a guide, also I heard it's quite touristic. Do you have any areas or specific mountains which you would recommend?

My mother was born in Saigon in 1969.
 She was able to get a copy of her birth certificate from the Philippine Statistics Authority but it is illegible.
 We emailed the Philippine Embassy in Hanoi but they said there's no report of her birth in the archives.
  
If the Philippine Embassy said her birth has no record, is there really no other way for her to get a legible copy of her birth certificate? The local registry here says she should send her personal documents to Vietnam for the correction of her birth certificate, but would it make sense to do that if her birth really has no record in the archives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Morning All,
 I am an American and I live permanently in Viet Nam with my wife who is Vietnamese.
 I have lived in Viet Nam for 10 years now and we recently moved here to live a more simpler life. However, I've been thinking about opening up my own business as I have extensive experience in my field and I feel quite confident I can make it work well.
 My question is what is the least hassle-free way of doing this. I have zero problem putting the business 100% into my wife's name if it means less issues.
 Would this be the recommended course of action? If so, is anyone aware of the fees or capital requirements for a 100% Vietnamese owner versus a foreigner owner? Anything else that might be worth taking into consideration?
 I'm not trying to shortcut any taxes or anything like that. I have no problem paying my fair share. I'm just trying to get everything started as cost-effectively as possible.
 Thanks!

 The train is of course much more convenient logistically than flying, but I have read so many horror blogs and reviews about cockroaches and absolutely feral toilets and smokers on the train etc. 
 It's now 2023 and I am not sure if some of the older reviews still hold. Has anyone done this recently? Should I just go back to Hanoi and fly to Hue and simply suck up the waste of a day? 
 Also, is the 'rainy season' in Hue/Hoi An in mid-October absolutely awful or usually ok for tourist activities? We booked international flight from Danang before checking weather so we are pretty much stuck with going to central area. Thanks in advance for any help.

 My Vietnamese girlfriend's mom was recently admitted into the hospital for some health issues. I would like to get her Get Well flowers.
 In the past I messed up by getting white flowers for my gf on Valentine's days. Supposedly her mom was not happy about it being white, because white is suppose to be used during a passing.
 What would be an appropriate color for flowers for this occasion?
 Appreciate the help!

Đứa bé nghiêm túc hỏi: “Con chào dì, dì cho con hỏi nhà dì có nến không ạ?”. Bà ta thầm nghĩ: “Cái gia đình này nghèo đến nỗi ngay cả nến cũng không có sao? Tốt nhất không cho, cứ như thế họ sẽ ỷ lại mất”.
 Nghĩ rồi, bà liền nói to một tiếng: “Không có!”. Đúng lúc bà ta đang chuẩn bị đóng cửa, đứa bé đó liền cười rạng rỡ và nói: “Con thừa biết là nhà dì không có nến mà!”. Nói xong, đứa bé liền lấy ra hai cây nến: “Mẹ và con sợ dì sống một mình không có nến nên con đem sang tặng dì hai cái để thắp sáng ạ!”. Lúc này, bà ta vừa tự trách bản thân, vừa cảm động rơi nước mắt, sau đó liền ôm chặt đứa bé vào lòng.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of curiosity, from those who have experienced any of these how effective does everyone think these following traditions are?: - Wind snatching (Dật gió) - Wind scraping (Cạo gió) - Cupping (Giác hơi) - Acupressure (Bấm Huyệt) - Bloodletting (Cắt llể)
 Do they actually help with what they intend to do (e.g reduce pain/stiffness, cure diseases, improve skin or health etc.) or are they mainly placebo from your experience?
 Context if you’re curious: I’ve lived in Australia my whole life and an currently in Vietnam to visit family after a long time. My family is very insistent on using traditional medicine techniques to improve my skin. They took me to a doctor who put small cuts on my skin all over my body, and when I searched this up I got the term ‘Cắt llể’ for bloodletting. They’ve been doing this almost more than weekly and they say that it’s getting all the bad blood out. In my opinion it’s a real pain and honestly I doubt it’s doing anything. But maybe it works for others?
 I’ve been provided wind scraping before with my family using the green eagle medicine and they said that the redder it is the more sick I am. It’s probably very red because of how hard they scrape it into my skin! It definitely helps warm you up though.
 I’m just wondering how this all is for both people who have lived in vietnam and how normal it all is. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a lot of us in the west, when we feel disillusioned with the way the world is going, we take positions against our government, take up anti-establishment slogans and listen to anti-establishment music. Fashion, music and art styles are born from opposition to cultural norms and government direction.
 How do people in Vietnam (and I suppose other one-party, unitary countries) express their dissatisfaction with contemporary culture without being political about it? Are young people generally less rebellious when there's a legitimate threat to criticising your country? How widely accepted is Vietnamese education with regards to politics and history? Do people tend to question it or accept it wholesale?
 Sorry if this is a controversial topic, it's just something that's been on my mind

 1) I can see lots of demolished buildings around Da Nang - what happened? 
 2) I noticed some buildings (houses mostly) are in the middle of empty urban lots - how come? 
 3) A lot of the shops in old town Hoi An sell the exact same products - why is this? Edit: by this I mean multiple stores selling the exact same T-shirt. Supply issue? Same owners? 
 4) In Da Nang lots of beach front hotels have been half built - is this because of Covid? 
 Thanks so much!

 I've been looking for things to do in Saigon and nothing really appeals to me. Obviously food and coffee culture there is amazing but what else?
 I also hate busy hustle and bustle cities. I currently live in one and want to get away from it.
 My plan is to go surfing and exploring in vung tau for 5-6 days. And then go to a relaxing resort/beach in phu quoc for 5 days.
 That still leaves about 7 days in Saigon... I wonder if I should just spend more time in vung tau and phu quoc instead of Saigon since I don't like city/night life.
 What you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am Ukrainian model working in Japan. My boyfriend’s Vietnamese. He used to be a model (that is how we met and fell in love 🥰), but now he has his own business.
 He is from a business family in Hanoi. His parents studied abroad and had business in Eastern Europe. So they can speak some Ukrainian. 
 His mom’s a lovely woman. She took care of me like her daughter. She bought me new clothes, taught me Vietnamese. I feel like little princess when staying with his family.
 She told me to get into university, because model is not a long lasting career. She’ll fund my education if I become her daughter in law 
 I love her, but I’m worried she’s trying to control me. Or I’m overthinking, bc I watch too many Korean dramas.
 Do old Viet parents change behavior after a girl become their official con dau?
 Can anyone give thoughts to this topic? ESP Vietnamese people or foreign women getting married with Vietnamese men
 Are there any Eastern European girls marrying with Vietnamese here? How is your relationship with Nha Chong

Tốt nghiệp đh ngành Supply Chain đi làm cũng được 6 năm ở Canada rùi. Hiện mình cũng đã có quốc tịch Canada. Vài tháng trước mình có về Việt Nam đám tang bà mình tiện thể ở Việt Nam 1 tháng để chơi. Mình nhận ra là mình đã bõ lỡ rất nhiều thứ ở Việt Nam từ khi mình đi du học. Từ lúc đó mình có suy nghĩ là mình muốn về Việt Nam làm việc và sinh sống. 1 phần cũng là vì để ở gần ba mẹ và ông mình, 1 phần là muốn tiềm hiểu thêm về ngành Supply Chain ở Việt Nam và mở rộng network và 1 phần nữa là tận hưởng những năm tháng thanh xuân mà mình đã bõ lỡ. Mình có apply vu vơ thì được 1 cty đa quốc gia nhận. Lương ~ $4000 usd/ tháng. Tầm tầm với bên này mình đang làm. Mình suy nghĩ nhiều lắm không biết có nên về hay không. Mình có ny bên này có nhà thuê có xe nhưng ngy mình thì k thể về vs mình được. 
 Các pạn có suy nghĩ gì cho mình xin ý kiến nhá. Thanks all.

 I’d love to stay for 3-6 months, and perhaps visit some other countries in SEA but we will see. Maybe even 6+ months if budget allows. 
 Would this an okay budget? I’ll have around 10k usd/237,100,000 vnd saved, and hoping to spend around 1,000-1500 usd a month if possible, but can go up in budget if needed.
 I’m good with street food and a simple affordable condo/apartment that maybe has a pool or something, I’m a simple guy. I don’t shop much or drink much, but I would like to participate in the nightlife some(few beers) and maybe go on some dates etc like on some weekends. Just have a little fun I guess.
 Sightseeing and experiences.. I have a few places in mind but would love a bunch of recommendations. Id like to explore around most of the country as much as possible so hit me with suggestions of some great places you enjoy. I have an interest in everything really!
 I think that’s about it, haha. And if there’s anyone who wants to show me around/go out for some fun when I land, I’d love to meet. Thanks in advance and hope yall are having a good day :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question 50 in the English high school graduation exam has stirred up controversy among candidates. 
 "Their pioneering (A) research showed that the learning motivation of the two groups of learners was quite distinctive (B) from each other, and the comparative (C) group whose learning motivation was stronger performed better than the control (D) group."

 The task requires identifying the underlined part that needs correction. 
 There were debates surrounding the correct answer, particularly regarding options B (distinctive) and C (comparative). Well-known IELTS teachers like Kien Luyen and Mai Phuong weighed in on the matter.
 ​
 🤔 While the official answer is B (distinctive), there are still many teachers who hold reservations about this conclusion.
 ​
 In your opinion, which answer do you believe is correct?

When I was young, I was in a baby walker and fell into a wood stove in the kitchen. There was no knowledge back in those days of how dangerous these baby walkers were. It left me with almost 90% burns to my body. After the accident, I was transported to Children's Hospital 1 in Saigon, where I stayed for two years for intensive care and treatment. 
 I felt lonely growing up, I didn't have many friends and felt ostracized by society. I dropped out of school due to intense bullying, even though it was my dream. I was lucky though to have one friend who was like me. They also did not go to school because they were bullied due to the way they looked. We spent time toget…]]></summary>

However, my girlfriend said the Vietnamese flag (red background, gold star) could be considered offensive to people (particularly southern Vietnamese, who have their own flag AFAIK) who had left Vietnam and might cause a problem if someone sees it. Is it that much of a problem?
 EDIT: I have now plastered the shining star onto the back of my laptop! Ha ha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that the salary of the staff at the ward administrative agencies is sometimes only 4.000.000 vnd per month. This salary is even lower than unskilled workers. Even with prime minister, it's only around 20.000.000 vnd. With this salary, no one can survive or support their family with only one job. It's not uncommon for them to regularly ask people for money when dealing with paperwork. In other words, are the people themselves paying these employees directly, not gorvement? And this is the reason why public administration in Vietnam so troublesome?
 Why don't they set up agencies that charge high fees (special lanes) for people's convenience? Instead of letting people being confused by the tricks of the staff to force people to pay bribes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I 28m am living in Houston, USA. I have noticed that it can be difficult to practice Vietnamese although I have been learning for some time. Often when I want to speak to the Viet people of Houston they often prefer to speak in English, yes I know that my Vietnamese is not perfect nor is my understanding and that dialect may be a barrier. At times I will ask they try to speak VNese with me even though I may struggle to understand. How do I make it known that I prefer to speak Vietnamese to improve my own understanding? 
 In houston we have many people speaking southern dialects and I have learned a northern dialect. I believe it is best to know and understand multiple dialects. I noticed that people will understand roughly what I am trying to say but out of politeness will not speak Vietnamese with me because they can tell from my speaking that maybe my understanding is not the best this happens most especially with viet kieu. 
 What are suggestions that you all would have to help me engage in normal conversation?

 The bottle is so small: 30 to 50ml max. The seller claims that the snake inside is real. I'm skeptical but it seems to be true. I also don't mind if it isn't since it costs less than 5$. 
 I bought four of them as souvenirs for my relatives back home, but now I am wondering if it will be ok to transport these internationally? Is it legal to do so?

My teacher suggested me to watch some cartoons/shows so I can get used to the speech, but I struggle to find things on Youtube with subtitles. Most of the videos have the auto-generated youtube subtitles, but they are pretty low quality and don't always come synchronized with the speech. I'm looking for some cartoons (mostly because of the smaller vocabulary) that have subtitles on them put on by the creators, not auto generated. Any ideas on what should I search for / recommendations? Thanks in advance 😀

 I am from New Zealand.
 I will be traveling to Vietnam as part of my travels to South East Asia.
 Exchange rates and options in my country are horrible. None of the banks do exchange of currencies anymore, and the options left here are very slim, and which charge high transaction fees with bad exchange rates given.
 I was wondering if i could bring $NZD bank notes with me and exchange it in Vietnam? Are there currency exchanges in Hanoi that would take NZD currency??
 Appreciate any advice given, thank you!

 Does someone have a school recommendation? And also, should I instead consider going to hcm to pick up the southern accent? (I’ve always preferred the north)

 I tried egg coffee in Hanoi and loved it. I want to let people in work try it but would rather make it at home. The recipe I found was vanilla extract, egg yolk and condensed milk whisked together. If I made this the night before and kept it in the fridge would it keep it's consistency the next day or does it need to be made fresh?

Does anyone know the name or how to make it? I think they provided it with some pork to dip into. I am having trouble remembering what it came with. Thanks.

The main reason for disapproval is because they think the prices are outrageous. They recommend I use local vendors. The problem is that I do not speak or read Vietnamese; trying to learn it. I got recommendations before for vendors in Quảng Ngãi but it is all through Facebook and there isn't a direct payment option like in the states. Trying to avoid just sending money, seems it feels very impersonal. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Do you guys, who arrived at the DAD (international), have any problems with drone confiscation or have any stories about it? Please share your experience, so I can decide to bring it with me or just buy it after my arrival. Thank you so much

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In short, going Vietnam 18-20days end of July to mid Aug.
 Places been before: DN, Hoian, Hue, Ninh Binh, Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Giang. (went before but dont mind using them as layover).
 I am planning to fly in from Saigon and fly out from Hanoi this time round. Have yet to book tickets
 Places i want to visit: Saigon!, Dalat!, Phong Nha! (4D tour).
 Places i can do without: Mekong Delta (AKA can tho?), Nha Trang, Mai Chau, Phu quoc(worth it?)
 My concern is Dalat to Phong Nha is a little detour, not too sure an efficient way to travel while passing by some other cities. I am considering Dalat to Hoi An 5D motorbike easyrider tour but feels a little expensive, then from Hoi An overnight bus to Phong Nha for 4D caving adventure and then Phong Nha to Mai Chau and to Hanoi back home. 
 It feels a little tired and what suggestions do u have? I can reroute my entire plan again

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been dating a Vietnamese girl for 3 months now since we met on a dating app. She's working on a visa in my country. We've been going to cafe's, weekend trips across my state, to local events like the show grounds and have an intimate relationship. However she refuses to call me boyfriend, even when strangers ask she clarifies I'm only "her friend" or "her neighbour". When challenged she says she's still deciding whether I'm a good person.
 At the same time she wants me to fly to her home city with her at the end of the year. And all her friends and colleagues from work say she talks about me often.
 Is this a cultural difference? Are women from Vietnam always so hesitant to call someone boyfriend?

 I'd also love to know if there are dishes/food that are hard to find outside of the region or are made differently in the North / South and if there are any specialties we should sample from a specific city.

 I just want to say, Vietnamese food is unparalleled. I’m also Southeast Asian (Philippines), but the food here hits differently. 
 It’s always perfectly balanced. Flavors aren’t aggressive, yet the food is very flavorful. The servings are always just right. The food is filling, but not heavy on the belly. It’s literally perfect for me. 
 I only stayed in Hanoi and Saigon, but I had the most fun just eating, interacting with locals and travelers, and people-watching. Everything I did here was so self-indulgent lol. 
 I’ll be back, Vietnam. Thank you for your rich history and culture. I learned a lot of your history after coming here, and I have huge respect for the people. 
 I will forever remember this place close to my heart ❤️.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in my parents owned apartment in a local neighbourhood. I am currently staying here for another year during my time in Vietnam. Although the apartment allows pets, there is a significant number of residents who strongly dislike them and the residents are majority older generation. They often demonstrate closed-mindedness, rudeness, and narcissistic behavior. Additionally, the staff, including security guards and cleaners, engage in gossip and talk behind our backs. I have personally experienced consistent rudeness from an older female cleaner. She unnecessarily reprimanded me when I was about to walk my dog after exiting the lift while she was cleaning. I was unaware of her cleaning schedule, but since then I avoid walking my dog at that time. She has also spread rumors among other residents, falsely labeling my dog and me as dirty. It's clear that she holds a personal grudge against me and my dog. I have been ignoring her but she constantly says it when I'm around and it is bothering me a bit.

 How would we go about this? 
 Each order separately, tell bikes 1-3 they need to wait for bike 4 to arrive, and then once bike 4 arrives all head off?
 Would this delay be acceptable to bikes 1-3? Is there some way to do this through the app itself?

They said between the three: Viettel, Mobifone and Vinaphone; Viettel wins consistency and core quality, while Vinaphone wins fastest speed almost 3x the second winner being Viettel. Mobifone eats dirt in almost every metric and I feel blind after reading that report. 
 You see, I've been using the same operator for more than a decade and I wonder if there is better fit for my needs, maybe you can find yours here too. I'm first:
 I use Mobifone.
 Connectivity is okay, worse on height, not much 5G. 
 Customer service is helpful and does available 24/7. 
 Good data package, I paid 300k VND per month for 8GB data daily. There are plenty options. 
 Their App works fine for all basic stuff you need, but the UI always feels like still in the Beta stage and not fully functional. That bugged me the most. 
 What's your mobile plan and how is your experience?

 I get sun burn ridiculously easily and being on a dive boat doesn’t help. I gave in and ended up buying a non la out of pure desperation to keep the sun far away from me. Turns out they’re actually really useful and now I understand why I see so many women wear them.

 Here's the thing; I've already legalized/authenticated my degree but the problem remains with my teaching certificate because the document was issued by a US institution (university) and I'm not a US citizen besides, my country isn't part of that hauge convention thing, so based on my research, i believe I can't authenticate the certificate in the US embassy in my home country.
 There's too much information online that I don't even know where to start and how to properly authenticate it. Has anyone had this experience before? (A non-us citizen authenticating a US document). What should i do? I don't want to fly to Vietnam before authenticating my TEFL, i know it would be much harder this way.
 Thanks in advance.

My boyfriend has no idea because he hasn't been there in more than ten years but he told me to not bring any clothing since they are produced in vietnam and are sold there cheaper (I wanted to buy Babys clothes for his cousin who gave birth recently).
 What are some things that you buy for your families in vietnam when you visit them? What are the most requested things? I read that gummy bears are very popular but I don't want to only bring gummy bears. He doesn't have lots of contact with his family so he's too shy to ask.

 I work for a company in Germany and have German citizenship (used to have Vietnamese citizenship). I'm planning to visit my family in Vietnam and work remotely for my German company from there later this year for about a month.
 The issue is that my company in Germany requires me to have a working permit in Vietnam, or an exempton for one, because according to them "I'm working in Vietnam". 
 I have done some research, and it seems like:
 " Working in Vietnam as a manager, executive, expert or technical worker for a period of work of less than 30 days and up to 3 times a year; " may exempts a foreigner from needing a work permit (source https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/vietnam/human-resources-and-payroll/visa-and-employment-permits). 
 However, I have personally asked https://www.vietnam-visa.com. It seems that I'm not eligible to apply for an exemption of work permit since I don't have a sponsor company in Vietnam and technically speaking, I don't work for any company in Vietnam.
 Does anybody have any experience applying for an exemption of work permit in Vietnam or something similar?
 Best regards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my second time in Vietnam. The first time I visit Vietnam as a teenage I never heard of the word. I am currently in Vietnam for the second time as an adult and I hear the term Viet Kieu a lot.
 Viet Kieu is a person with Vietnamese blood that is living outside of Vietnam, whether they were born in Vietnam or another country. 
 Sometimes people call me a Viet Kieu or I will tell them that I am a Viet Kieu. Now that I think about it, is it a good thing or bad thing? I know is it a way to label us but I have been saying it with pride. 
 I know different people have their own opinions about Viet Kieu. People may like or dislike us, think we are rich, or expect us to bring gifts from our country to give to our relatives in Vietnam. They may look down on us because we escaped our home country due to the war or think we are lucky because we were able to create a life outside of Vietnam. We may or may not be rich in our country but the money exchange from our country to Vietnam makes us look rich.
 I rented an apartment with my family and they told me all the Viet Kieu lives in this apartment. My family told me girls will want us for citizenship. My mom told me not to tell people that I am in a Viet Kieu in public because I will get robbed.
 A lot of people try to talk to me in English. When I start talking to them in Vietnamese, they would tell me that they thought I was from overseas. I tell them I was born and live overseas. I do ask the locals about this in person but Reddit is a better platform to be straight up. Some people that I ask are the older generation that lived through the war or the new generation that were born after the war. 
 Give it to me straight. Give me your opinion. Is it a title I should wear with pride or embarrassment and shame?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was talking to my dad about Vietnamese pronouns and how different pronouns can feel more intimate and special.
 My favorite pronouns is mình/tôi which typically means the same and is used to refer to yourself but is also used by couples. I like its insinuation that your partner is a part of you and it's very cute and endearing.
 Another interesting one is moi/toi which means me and you in French and was sometimes used by folks during the French colonialization of Vietnam.

What are some Vietnamese cultural norms/do's & dont's that we should know of? Thanks!

 I know dating apps are popular these days, but I'm honestly not the best when it comes to texting and connecting with people I don't know well. I prefer more personal interactions where I can get to know someone face-to-face.
 So, my question is, what are some effective ways for me to meet and connect with people in HCM city? Are there any local events, clubs, or communities that you would recommend joining? Maybe you know of specific places where people tend to gather and socialize? All suggestion or personal experience is welcome.
 p/s: I speak both english and vietnamese fluently.

 I'm sorry if you do this haha, but it's so annoying to witness/be around when this is happening! For example: My aunt called my other aunt (whose house we were driving to which is less than 15 mins away) and put her on speakerphone and all I heard was my other aunt tussling dishes and food prepping for a house party. My dad and aunt do this too and my cousin told me her old bosses at the nail shop she used to work at do that too! If I'm around someone doing it I don't even like to talk cause it feels like the other person silent on the other end of the phonecall is eavesdropping or that I'm intruding even though they're sitting in silence lol. My cousin and I were talking about it but we didn't have a good reason as to why. 
 What is the reason?!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am doing a 11 day trip and visiting these cities. Will be traveling by plane. About 3-4 days each country.
 I plan to stay the weekend in Hanoi for the night life.
 I know this route is odd as I am jumping from Cambodia and Vietnam but they were the cheapest flight with no layovers. I’m don’t want to do long bus trips considering my trip is short. 
 Has anyone done this route or something similar?
 I’m looking for recommendation on what to do and in which order. I’m getting little overwhelmed with the options I see. Considering this is a short trip, what do you think is an absolute must do? Time frame and cost would be good

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Edit: the title is supposed to say "Man needs help learning English" not Vietnamese. I also posted this in r/Vietnamese and I guess the words got jumbled around in my head, sorry)
 I should start by saying that I am only assuming this man is Vietnamese, because I googled his name, Tran, and Google says it's a Vietnamese name. 
 I work at a gym, and this man comes in to work out and use our massage chairs. Any time he needs to communicate something to me he uses Google translate, and he does know a few phrases like "thank you" and "good night," but today he brings his phone up to me and shows me his question, which is that he would like help learning English. 
 He asked for my phone number and I didn't want to be rude, so I gave it to him, but he texted me saying he needs someone to help him learn English. 
 I'm not really a teacher, and I definitely don't speak Vietnamese. I want to provide some sort of help, because he's always so nice and patient when I'm helping with whatever he needs around the gym, but I'm at a loss for what to say. 
 I was hoping maybe reddit would be a good place to find people who understand Vietnamese culture, and might know what sort of help he is looking for specifically?
 (I have texted him asking if he is Vietnamese just to be sure. I really hope that doesn't come off as rude. Just trying my best guys. Waiting on that response)
 (I flaired this as discussion but realistically a flair like "language" might be more apt. I picked what seemed to make the most sense out of the options, sorry if I didn't use it right)

 Since I have been traveling the north solo, I have interacted with locals. It is hard to understand non-Saigon accent sometimes but I can understand enough to hold a conversation. I will tell them that Hanoi accent is hard to understand and that I learned Vietnamese from my family who is from Saigon. One person said that Hanoi Vietnamese is the proper way. Even the American War museum was so much different from American history. It shows how little I know about my roots.
 Please recommend your 3 top must read books. It can be about the war, history in general, culture, or anything.
 The books have to be in English because I cannot read Vietnamese lol.

 They say:
  
This shipment contains cosmetics. As articles 35 circular 06/2011/TT-BYT, consignee can only imports cosmetics with total customs value under 1,000,000VND. If it’s over 1,000,000VND, you must provide the import permit from Ministry of Health.
  
Can that really be right..?! You need a permit from the ministry of health? I found the referenced legislation here but I see no mention anywhere of a 1,000,000 limit on imports 🤷

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! My name is Victor, from Saigon Dragon Studios. For a bit more than 2 years now we’ve worked on the RTS game Space Tales, and today we’re making its Steam page public :)
 https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457960/Space_Tales/?beta=0
 Quick background about us: we’ve launched SDS in 2015, as an outsourcing studio specializing in video game 2D and 3D arts. Vietnam (and HCMC) are well known in the video game industry as several top outsourcing companies are located there. A ton of Vietnamese talents have worked on famous games/movies. Surprisingly however, there aren’t many studios in Vietnam who develop and publish their own games (– whenever I am in a game convention for example I always hear ‘ah yes Vietnam, it’s where Flappy Bird was made”, which really annoys me because it’s not representative of the talents Vietnam has.)
 A couple of years ago we decided to start working on our own game in parallel of our outsourcing services, and we wanted to do as much as possible in Vietnam (only music and sounds are being made elsewhere). We still have a lot of work to do on our game, but we would love to hear your feedback on what we have to show for now.
 The teaser for our game can also be watched on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elHEmpUTcEk 
 Looking forward to receiving your feedback.

My mom basically forced me to come with her this past June, and I was dreading it bc the time difference, the heat, and the fact that it’s more of a developing country and I’m so spoiled in the Us. Well that was so naive of me because I definitely had an unforgettable experience and vietnam blew me away. 
 We backpacked a bit through vietnam, we went to Saigon, Canh Tho, Cu Chi, Sapa, Hanoi, halong bay, phu quoc, Mekong, tay ninh. At first when I landed I couldn’t wait to get back home. But throughout the trip , the sights were in believable, the food amazing, the motorbikes were so fun, and just cruising through the streets people watching of the cities was so enjoyable. There was just so much to see culture wise as well and opened my eyes to a different lens of the world. and now that I’m back home I feel a small heartache which I wasn’t expecting. It’s been 2 days and I’m still thinking abt this trip
 Although some people were rude and inconsiderate, most were so kind, they treated me and my sister like celebrities. (I thought we looked viet but guess not lol) ppl were constantly approaching us saying we were beautiful. Also i noticed that everyone talks to each other like they already know each other, which is so different than in america. I loved vietnam and want to go back again. This trip holds a special place in my heart and I think will trigger me to start travelling internationally more because that was transformative

 I recently met, then started dating a wonderful girl from Vietnam. Her birthday is quite soon, i have my ideas on what to buy her, but I was wondering if theres any particular gift that a Vietnamese girl, or Vietnamese people might appreciate for their birthday. 
 It's been a month or so, but we really, really appreciate each other a lot already, so something cheesy is ok too. That can include cooking. Already tried egg coffee and lemongrass chicken so far. She's in her mid 20s if that helps, and we both live in Europe.
 Also, I wanted to give appreciation to you guys in general, I didn't know much about Vietnam, but you guys are so nice and welcoming It's scary, your country's history is pretty humbling too. I can't wait to be lucky enough to visit Hanoi one day !
 Thanks, in advance.

 I'm planning a trip in December. I spent six weeks in Central Vietnam about 10 years ago and I loved it! Unfortunately I've been struggling with health problems for the last couple of years, and so this trip is very much going to be a relax by the pool type of affair.
 I was considering Hoi An or potentially Sapa for a 10 day stay? The touristy nature of Hoi An is a bit confronting whereas the Northern mountain ranges are attractive as hell to me. Can anyone lend their opinion/give any recommendations for a resort-style stay that isn't going to be busy to the point of stressful?
 Proposed Itinerary
 December 1st - 4th Fly into Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay for a few nights to recover from flight
 December 4th - 14th Bus/train/plane to destination and stay for 10 days
 December 14th - 17th Bus/train/plane back to Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi and stay a few days before departure
 Additional Info
  
I should be able to manage around 5,000 steps each day
 Budget is around $4,000 AUD for two people for 17 days (not including flights)
 I'm used to travelling for the adventure so this style of travel will be very new to me. Anything luxurious + off the beaten path is very appealing!
  
Would appreciate any help! Thanks.

The skin was not pierced in any way and there was no wound apart from small red marks where the teeth were. From reading online apparently rabies can only be transmitted through penetration of the skin.
 I’m just feeling a bit concerned, I’m in Hanoi and don’t speak any Vietnamese apart from a few basic words and not sure where I could go to explain my issue
 Hope this post is appropriate for the sub, just didn’t know where else to ask
 Thank you
 EDIT - thanks so much to everyone for the advice, I’m heading to an international hospital and have my documents ready. Really appreciate everyone’s support on this post it means a lot 🙏
 EDIT 2 - Just got my first jab and now have a schedule for the next 4! Feeling much more at ease now

 Tôi là nam 18 tuổi và đã đến Catfe trong chuyến đi đến Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh ở Việt Nam (ngày 19 tháng 6). Khi tôi ở đó, tôi đã thử vuốt ve một con mèo mới được giới thiệu với Catfe. Trước khi có thể vuốt ve con mèo, một cô gái tình cờ cảnh báo tôi rằng con mèo mới đến và nó cắn. Dù sao tôi cũng quyết định vuốt ve nó và cuối cùng bị trầy xước, nhưng điều mà tôi vẫn nghĩ sau đó là giọng nói của cô gái đó nghe thật hấp dẫn làm sao. Tôi không nghĩ đến việc bắt chuyện vì tôi muốn nhìn thấy nhiều mèo hơn, nhưng càng nghĩ về tình huống đó, tôi càng nghĩ về cách tôi nên tiếp cận cô gái mặc quần yếm màu hồng đó. Cô ấy không chỉ có giọng hát hay mà còn rất xinh đẹp và thậm chí trang phục của cô ấy cũng rất tuyệt. Nếu điều này đến được với cô ấy, tôi sẽ coi đó là một phép màu. 
 ​
 I am an 18 year old male and went to a Catfe during my trip to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam (June 19). While I was there I tried petting a new cat that was introduced to the Catfe. Before being able to pet the cat, a girl just so happened to warn me that cat was new and that it bites. I decided to pet it anyway and ended up getting scratched, but what I kept thinking about afterwards was how attractive that girls voice sounded. I didn't think about starting a conversation because I wanted to see more cats, but the more I think about that situation, the more I think about how I should have approached that girl in pink overalls. Not only was her voice pretty, but she was beautiful too and even her outfit was awesome. If this ever reaches her I would consider it a miracle. 
 ​
 Catfe address: CATFE, 119 Đ. Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai, Phường Bến Thành, Quận 1, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh 700000, Vietnam

 I'm building an app to learn foreign languages by reading books, called FLReader, and I'm looking for people who could help me improve it by using it and giving me feedback.
 It's pretty easy to use, I think. You either upload an epub or download one from our server. Then you just click on the words and it will translate the word and the phrase.
 You can download it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jorgeperezgomez.flreader2
 Future versions will store the words for future review, provide basic lessons on grammar so the user can read the book, and so on. But I wanted to share the app first and find early adopters who could give me some feedback about how it can be improved.
 We also have a reddit sub where people will be able to tell us what they think, ask for new features and so on: https://www.reddit.com/r/FLReader/

 I'm travelling to Vietnam this summer and I need to get from Ninh Binh to Halong Bay and then from Halong Bay to Hanoi.
 We read online that it is the best option to book buses and 12go.asia was often recommended. Just wanted to check if anyone has experience with this site and can suggest one of the many travel companies. 
 Thanks in advance

 i am planning to visit vietnam with my friends (and be kind of guide as i have vietnamese roots) but due to my personal reasons, we might have to postpone the trip for october/november
 we didnt buy tickets or anything but my friends dont like the idea of postponing things if not necessary (which i understand), but i might be a bit too financialy unstable and work stressed in march/april, thats why i suggested possible postponing for october/november
 the thing is that i want to provide them with great experience and memories but also personally, it would be better for me in october/november and i am considering to be a bit selfish for a change and do it in october/november, however i do not want them to go there and experience unpleasant weather the whole time (understandably, it will be raining in some places)
 can i still sell them the idea of great trip even though it would be in october/november instead of march/april (kind of knowing that march/april are ideal months for visit)
 thanks for your opinions:)

 I've tried searching on Google for tours/vans etc, but they're all $100+. Same with Airbnb Experiences. Seems like a rip-off. I don't need hand-holding through the temple, just the transportation up and back.
 All of the tourist-oriented shops around the city look like total scams, so I haven't bothered with these either.
 Also considered using Grab but it's not really designed for long distances... I'm worried I'd get stranded out there.
 Anything I'm missing? Or do I really need to rent my own vehicle to take this trip?

 I didn't realize my phone was stolen at that time, but I realized it was gone at that time she touched me. It happened on Thursday and today, I find out that thief logged in to my Apple account and deleted what I registered as stolen phone. 
 I bought my Iphone 14 pro 4 months ago and now it's gone lol. I should have more careful about my things, but at I feel so bad about what happened to me beyond money. One of the worst moment of my life so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never got a driver license in my home country so when I got married my wife(who is Vietnamese) decided it would be best to get a drivers license in Vietnam. The theory test which is all in Vietnamese of course involved me studying and memorizing answers for 6 months. As a result I was able to easily pass it along with the theory test. Despite being an inexperienced driver I thought that tge practical test would be a piece of cake. But I've just failed my 4th test in 4 months. I feel hopeless and useless. My wife passed it after the first try and really can't understand why I can't pass it. To make things worse my Vietnamese in laws and all their friends and relatives are making feel awful about not passing the test.
 I am starting to feel hopeless and depressed and I feel really pressured by everyone around me to pass. I do a practice run the day before I take the test everytime and I am usually able to pass with 100 points but when it comes to the test I always end up messing something up. Today I even failed within the first two minutes. The other times I was actually pretty close to passing but messed up. I have gone around the course on my own many times and have no issue passing. I don't know whats wrong with me.

I flew there specifically for this trip and spent four nights on the loop and a few nights in Hanoi on either side. I can't help but shake the feeling that I still have a lot left to see in Vietnam when I am able to return!
 I took so much useful information from this awesome community when planning my trip to Ha Giang, so I wanted to return the favour and take some time to give something back. Hopefully helping/inspiring others to plan their Ha Giang trip, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be moving to Hanoi at the end of August and I'm wondering about the dating scene there.
 Ideally, I'm looking to build something serious but not necessarily with a local. I'm rather Western European in my expectations and ways. . . 
 My questions are roughly. . .
  
if you found your significant other in Vietnam, how/where was that?
 
how is the dating process? (I've heard it's extremely slow) Are the kind of locals willing to move faster and/or hook-up, the same kind that you'd want to date or not at all?
 
from dating apps: first dates as coffee dates or wine/cocktail dates? Or something else? (I never invite ppl over directly from apps - I need to feel a personal connection first and also for safety reasons)
 
is going to a bar/club alone a thing? Or only some clubs/bars are good for this?
 
ultimately, where do you meet people and socialize? I tend to do a lot of "expat event" kind of things but, depending on the country, the ppl that show up are not necessarily the nicest.
 
would it be very limiting to try and date only other expats?
 
finally, what pitfalls you'd warn another foreigner about?
 
 No need to answer each and every. I just want to get an overall impression of what to expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello~
 So I've heard that pho is can be prepared very differently depending on what area of Vietnam you are in, so I had the idea of doing a whole-country pho tour later this year. Start at the top/bottom and make my way to the other side while trying pho (and other food of course) in different cities.
 So I have a few questions, especially for people who have more experience with Vietnam and trying food in different areas of the country!
  
Do you think this is a fine idea, or a waste of time? Is pho really that different depending on what part of Vietnam you are in, or is it mostly the same?
 Which areas (or specific restaurants) would you recommend I try for a complete experience?
 Are there any other regional foods that you recommend I try on this journey?
  
I will be trying to document as much of this as possible, so I will definitely come back with my thoughts and feedback on how different they actually were, my favorites, etc!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't had the opportunity to visit Vietnam since I was 6 years old. About 5 years ago my parents divorced and my dad figured it was time to go back to Nha Trang. Last week I received news that he had fallen incredibly ill so I booked a last minute trip to Vietnam to visit him for about 3 weeks. Although this isn't exactly a vacation as I plan on helping to care for my dad, I'm sure there will still be plenty of opportunities to go exploring and get back in touch with my Vietnamese heritage.
 Given that I haven't gone by since I was 6 and that I'm from California, I really have no idea how to prepare. What should I bring? What should I be cautious about? What are some dos and don'ts? I'm a pretty open-minded eater and literally wish to try all the things. Any recommendations?
 Other things about me:
 My Vietnamese is decent, I understand the southern accent very well and can get by in terms of speaking, but things get a little rough if the other person has a northern accent. If the other person has a central accent, no way lol. Unfortunately I can't read Vietnamese either.
 I'm terrible at dealing with the heat but can manage if I have to.
 I'm not taking days off work and plan to work (I'm a software engineer director) as well. How's the coffee shop scene over in Nha Trang?
 Any recommendations on what I must do over there on this last minute unplanned trip would also be appreciated!

 I was offered a job in market research for a big international corporation that has an office in HCM.
 I'm from Romania and I saw on Numbeo the comparison between my city (Bucharest) & HCM, but an advice from people living there would be very helpful. 
 I would want to rent a 1 room apartment/studio in district 1, 5 or 10, which are close to my job. I don' want a luxurios life style but I would probably eat out often, go in bars, experience the local culture, travel and overall want to live a confortable life. Not be very aware of every dollar spent.
 Is it enough 1000$ to do all that (pay rent, travel in vietnam, eat out, drink, local transport, groceries, etc,)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I have been in Vietnam for a month now, and want to learn the language better as I want to have better interactions with locals and respect their land. I want to show the people here that I’m not a foreigner who only speaks English.
 Here’s the thing - I’m doing job interviews at the moment trying to get a job, but have limited money at the moment. I did a trial lesson at a centre, and after the lesson they asked if I wanted to pay for my tuition fees then and there. The fees were 19.6 for 80 hours (I believe?) but I told them I don’t have the money for it currently due to finding work and not employed. I really want to start learning as soon as possible, but really struggle with apps such as Duolingo and resources like YouTube. I can’t learn anything from there - I get super distracted because of my ADHD and prefer in-class.
 Do you have any suggestions, or should I just wait until I start getting a salary and have more money? It’s making me a little sad that I only speak English and want to learn the language because I feel like I’m experience 1/50th of the life here…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings. 
 My wife is currently holds a U.S. green card but she is a Vietnamese citizen. She went to Vietnam in the beginning of May to visit her family after graduating and starting her job in August. She figured while she was there she would renew her passport (Expired in June of 2023). Unknown to us that there’s a shortage issue with the newer ID there and she can only renew her passport using that newer ID. It’s been a month and a half, there’s no sign of her getting the ID. Is there something she can do so that she can return back to the U.S. more urgently? Or rather what’s the average wait time for the ID to get processed, printed, and shipped? For future planning. 
 Thank you in advance.

I noticed some of yall seem cool as a cucumber out in the unshaded areas, not a drop of sweat. Then I see others with fans out. Then I see others bolting into air conditioned buildings just drenched. How are y'all handling this heat? I've been handling it by just putting my hair up, going out and about earlier in the mornings, hydrating, fan and something to wipe my sweat up from my vitiligo'd face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I plan to stay and work (write) in Vietnam for a month. The earliest I can go is mid-October and the latest I can return is the first week of January. I want to mainly stay in one place. I'd really like to hit the beach maybe every second day as well. 
 Is there any place that will have decent whether in Vietnam during this time, is good for digital nomads (mostly cafes or co-working spaces that are good for laptop -work) and near a beach?
 I initially had planned to go to Da nang but now read that the weather will be very wet

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/vietnam. I will be visiting HCM next week and I'm planning to buy a Samsung phone because it's cheaper there than here in the Philippines where I live. I was initially planning to order it online and have it delivered to Bitexco Tower or any nearby branch but I can't proceed with the website order page. From step 2 shipment details, it doesnt proceed to step 3 select payment. So I might just check and buy it in the actual Samsung Store. Is it true that you cannot buy in the Bitexco branch? The other nearest to my hotel is the 134 Nguyen Thai Hoc St. branch. Anyway, can anyone check the latest price of Samsung S23+ in HCM? I just wanted to check if it's the same as the one in store. Also, if this is the wrong sub to post this inquiry, please help me identify the correct one.
 Since I'm already here, any tips on my upcoming trip? Previously went to Hanoi already. Can anyone perhaps help me identify the correct sequence of how I should plan my route/itinerary to visit the most famous spots in the city? Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was talking with my partner about maybe going to a Japanese place to eat with their little brother, but I wasn’t sure if the little brother would necessarily like the place. I then asked, “Does he know how to eat it?”
 And my partner seemed to be quite confused. They were just kind of like, “Yes, he knows how to use chopsticks?? And you just chew and swallow??”
 There seems to be some confusion since I directly translated, “Biết ăn không?” into English as opposed to saying something like “Oh would this fit his palette?”
 So my question is- how would you go about translating/explaining “biết ăn không?” to someone who doesn’t speak Vietnamese?

 But since I've visited all of the main sights like Palace of reunification, war remnants museum, Landmark 81 and a few temples in D5, I'm getting quite bored and I want to find other things to do here.
 I plan on going to other parts of the country but at the moment I only work in the evening during the week so it makes it harder to find time when looking at traveling around Vietnam.
 What can anyone recommend to do here? Any hidden gems?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I assumed they were pro-France because 1. the South Vietnamese government was backed by France 2. I think a third of France's army in the Indochina War were Vietnamese who relocated to the South. 3. they have a Catholic majority.
 But from talking to South Vietnamese supporters it sounds like they also hate France too. Yet the French flag was raised throughout South Vietnam. Did the South Vietnamese want to expel ALL foreign occupiers or did they want joint cooperation? Was the North more nationalistic than the South?
 To me the North sounds a lot more like the American founding fathers and the South were more interested in neocolonialism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live a great life in the U.S. but as I am sitting at work, I still think about moving back to Vietnam or how to do so in the future. This obsession has been going on for years now.
 I'm aware of all the pros and cons, it's just that I have this strange yearning to be there. My mom passed away last year and her family is still in Vietnam. We are very close and I want to live near her family before they all pass away as well. They are one connection I have left with her.
 The main issue is that I won't be able to get more than 3-4 weeks vacation off each year from work, and tickets will cost around 8k now. The flight is so long too just for a trip where we'll be spending at least one week with jetlag and stomach issues. Plus, my wife wants to go on vacations/beaches while I just want to near Quan 7 with the relatives.
 I've thought about moving to Orange County or Houston to ease this feeling, but those Vietnamese cities just don't feel the same. 
 I know the future is far brighter in 15 years for the family if I stay in the U.S., I just feel sad each day working. I spend hours thinking about having enough money to live in Vietnam without worrying about the future.
 It's not rose-tinted glasses either, I worked remotely and had lived in Vietnam for 6 months recently with my wife/child. It was great. I know education and healthcare might be a problem later on. Waking up early for coffee and breakfast while watching the crazy traffic, going out to eat seafood/hot pot at night - that just can't be beaten.
 I suppose I'm just ranting and being too greedy. I can always get a significant pay cut/career limitation and get a remote job to live in Vietnam. It's just that I want what's best for my family/kid's future as well.
 Does anyone(especially the Viet Kieus) feel the same way?

Do you also consider the people of Champa as your ancestors or only the kinh people, becuase I have read that the Champa people were assimilated when Champa was conquered by Dai Viet. Viet culture such as clothingsetc were imposed on them. This means that south vietnam people are also related genetically to the austronesians (PH, IND, MLY). Is the Champa civilization also taught in schools as a part of vietnamese culture?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A parent named Le Mau Duyen has been fined 6.5 million VND for physically assaulting his child's teacher. The assault was alleged because the child received the teacher's "average conduct" rating.
 This assessment was given to the student due to an incident where the student insulted the teacher after arriving late to class. The parent, persistently blaming the teacher for hindering their child's enrollment in police schools, where “good level” conduct is required, finally resorted to physically attacking the teacher.
 In Vietnam, students are evaluated based on their academic performance and conduct, using a system with four levels: Good, Fair, Average, and Weak.
 What do you think about it?

They transferred her to a police station in Vietnam and the police officer used Viber to video talk with my wife in full uniform. She declined when he started asking for passport information. He said if she does not trust it she can investigate herself or find another way to have it investigated. Has anyone got a call like this before? The phone numbers check out online but this just screams scam to me. Just looking for advice and how to move forward with this?

 I’m not interested in the ‘tagging’ I see everywhere. I like big colourful artworks that people put a lot of time and effort into.

I drink plenty of water, i tired drinking ice, coffee,coconut water, avocado, fruits…anything you can imagine that someone should avoid for food poisoning…nothing is helping me. Are laxatives here too strong for western people? 
 I have not changed my diet as i am vegetarian…but my stomach looks like I swallowed a watermelon.

 The thing that gets me is that Saigon always had more french influence then Ha Noi. It was directly governed by Paris as opposed to the rest of Vietnam which was under harsher colonial rule. It was the center of french colonial life in Indochina with the French having their tennis clubs and Rugby teams.
 Yet I haven't seen as many old french mansions(of course there are lots of old government buildings but less so then Ha Noi)

Everything from the food to the people are top notch. I don't know whether it's because I come from a country where women who drink and smoke and walk the streets late at night are perennially unsafe, but being here is simply so liberating. I haven't travelled the world much, but I've been to the Middle East, Singapore, and Germany, and none of them compare. Being here is a cultural shock in a good way.
 I know this post is vague, but I just wanted to say thank you so much wherever I could and to whomever I could, hence me doing so here. Vietnamese people are the warmest, most down to earth people I've come across 🙏🏽 I hope to keep visiting and learn the language someday.

How’s the situation now? Should it be something to worry about? If so, would I be better off heading to central/southern regions? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in Vietnam. I went back home and when I came back to Vietnam I brought some souvenirs and gifts. Nothing special. I was brought up "minimalist". I never bought fancy gifts for my partners, friends, and family. So, why would I do that to people who are, well, at the periphery of my friendzone?
 And all in all: Isn't it the thought that counts?
 Anyhow, my gifts received some harsh comments. For instance, a Vietnamese friend got some brand clothes from Europe. I bought some toys for his younger brother. Do you know Playmobil? A bit like Lego. I confess, the two toys (a Wild-west Fort and a Pirate ship) were on discount. But they cost about 100$. That is more than I gave to my bf for Christmas, LOL. Anyhow, I can survive that a 10yo doesn't say thankyou and is happy. But my friend said, that his brother was disappointed because he wanted some more "valuable".
 I am not on a paylevel which enables me to throw around with MacBooks and Iphones. I do not have such devices neither.
 Another time I was invited and I bought a 25$ red wine bottle. In my home country Germany that would already be too much. Most guests will spend about 10-15$. No one really awaits a 1,000$-bottle of Rothschild stuff.
 Anyhow, the host was quite rude. During the evening he showed my bottle, made a gesture like vomitting and put it aside. Then he presented a fancy Whiskey bottle and told everyone that the bottle was about 200$. This person was not even close to me, so why would I pay 200$ for some alcohol? I am in general a generous guy, but these two examples (there are quite more in my experience) are really too much. I understand, I am the "rich" foreigner. But they cannot really await that I come of dozens of Iphones, cars, laptops? I feel really sad, since my personal life is not circling around consumption.

This time, I am planning on exploring by myself without a guide. My worry is that I am very awkward talking to people who aren't my parents, and I constantly feel like my vietnamese is at a 6 year old's level. Is there any conversation etiquette that I should be of prior to going? 
 I'll be staying at the Thanh Tai hotel (closest to airport) next week. Are there any recommendations on where I should go, any tips for walking about etc? I'll be in HCM for a week. Thanks

 Would the water be too cold to go into the beach in late December? 
  
Many thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a native, I struggle to find something truly captivating within our local art scene. Mainstream stuff is extremely low-brow, while art-house offerings often appear nonsensical and lacking substance. Many galleries and events rely almost exclusively on foreign funds like the Goethe Institute. I'm curious about the differences between our art scene and those of other developing countries. Is there a way to bridge this gap and create artistically profound and entertaining art, similar to what filmmakers like Bong Joon Ho and Park Chan Wook have achieved in Korea?

From what I understood the CRBA follows the name on the Vietnamese birth certificate however, id like my kid to have a western name if possible not a Vietnamese name on the American citizenship. I’m perfectly fine with a Vietnamese name on the Vietnamese citizenship due to the naming laws. Cheers

 I find it very disruptive. I wonder why people buy tickets when they don't even want to watch the movie in the first place. The theater also didn't have loud sounds so we could hear everyone in the room talking loud about something else except the movie.
 Is it common for vietnamese people to talk too loud during movies in cinema?

A friend and I are going to be in Hanoi for 10 days in July, and we were planning on spending 5 days in Hanoi, a day trip to Ninh Binh and the last 3 nights in Ha Long Bay, but we've been seeing threads on how Ha Long is deserted and there's no point in staying the night there.
 Can someone please provide some clarity on whether this is true and too much time in Ha Long? Taking an overnight cruise is a little outside our budget so we're not keen on that, especially given that one of us is prone to seasickness. Would it be better to spend a couple of days elsewhere in the north? If yes, where should we be going?

Nguyên nhân khiến mình áp lực và thất vọng có lẽ là vì mình đã làm "vua chột trong xứ mù quá lâu" và được bạn bè, thầy cô, cha mẹ cho là giỏi suốt những năm đi học mãi tới sau này mình mới nhận ra điều này, Mình mới dùng reddit vì cũng chả biết chia sẻ với ai nữa. Em biết điểm số bây giờ không còn quan trọng nữa nhưng em vẫn thấy khó chịu ấy ạ, kiểu trước giờ luôn nghĩ mình có một cái gì đặc biệt nhưng thực ra lại rất bình thường và khi nhận ra điều đó làm em khó chấp nhận ấy ạ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fairly sure I just got scammed, just wanting to make sure and any precautions I should take- gave the guy my email.
 Guy came up to me on the street with his scooter and started talking to me, picking me as Australian. Told me he has family in Australia and telling me all about them. Asked if I'd like to get a drink with him, which I was happy to do!
 Spent some time drinking with him, during which time he told me his family were visiting and they were having a big party. When it was time to go, he asked if I'd buy a bottle of wine for their party, which I agreed to do. He took me about a 10min ride away to a shop to buy wine, which cost 900,000 dong and then took me back to where we met. I realised at the time the wine was very expensive but I was a little drunk and didn't know where I was exactly so I didn't protest. I assume he just takes the wine back and splits the profits with the shop! 
 While we were drinking he took my email, I assume he'll try and have me send money for something else, but should I watch out for anything else? 
 Thanks for any advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, 
 In Vietnam for 9 days and trying to get from Ha Long Bay to Hoi An. What‘s the best mode of travel? Is a sleeper bus too mad? Will the trains be too long and too much of a nightmare? We would just fly from Hanoi but it seems a shame not to see more of the country from the road / track. Or maybe that’s us being too romantic!
 Thanks!

I came here as a foreigner alone for my summer vacation and I am afraid that because of this I might not be able to go back to my home country. Any advice on what should i do? I have asked around and some people say to just overstay for 2-3 months until you are fully recovered and pay a fine. while some say i should get to the immigration department as soon as possible even if it is difficult for me to move. I am really scared as I am alone and do not speak vietnamese.

 If I can visit shop first and see the product then that would be good. I need to check the size as I'm now staying in a smallish apartment which has a small kitchenette. I'm currently staying in Vung Tau. Will be visiting Ho Chi Minh City tomorrow to buy. 
 Any recommendations?

Although, most of them doesn't talk to me after a few messages and the one who does talk to me want to get married so naturally Id asked to meet up. Before meeting up theyd try to get me to sign up to some dodgy exchange or help them with money and when I refuse, they'd say that because I don't trust them so no point carrying on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I was pick pocketed last night around 1am (this morning I guess if you want to get technical). This was at a bar on Saigons Bui Vien walking street. My wallet only had a few hundred thousand dong and a bank card that I canceled as soon as I noticed my wallet was gone. The bar staff told me to go to the police the following morning because they stop operating at 10pm. 
 I didn’t bother going to the police because it would be a waste of everyone’s time for such a small crime. But is this the truth? Or was the staff telling me this so that the police would not come to the bar and ruin the party?

 I was traveling for 2 weeks in Vietnam and purchased a Vietnamobile SIM
 I jsut got home to Australia, put my Dodo sim in my unlocked iphone xr, and suddently get SIM UNSUPPORTED error and it is now SIM locked. To Vietnamobile
 ​
 I have spent three days on chat to apple, dodo and vietnamobile, NOBODY is accepting responsibility, each company tells me it is the others responsibility
 ​
 Has anyone had this issue when returning home and if so, how did you unlock your phone?
 I live alone and have no phone access and cannot afford another iphone :(
 ​
 This must happen all the time to tourists, surely?
 ​
 Any help is SOOOOO appreciated, I am so stressed and exhausted trying to fix this
 ​
 TO ADD: So many of you have been so helpful, thankyou
 ​
 For the one who called me a troll and a luddite and illiterate, really unkind and unecessary to attack a stranger who has spent days trying to resolve this and been told different answers by Apple, and 3 different carriers / telcos. So yes, it is frustrating and stressful, and being called an idiot and a troll online is not helpful or kind.

 From Ha Noi, we would like to take the 3days/2nigts cruise to Ha Long Bay (or maybe Lan Ha Bay) and spend the remaining days in Ha Noi before flying home again.

 This young man netted nearly $800k-1,200k in USD cash (19yt to 29ty vnd) and fled to the United States. He promised the payers that if they contribute and add money to his investment, they will gain profit and will be distributed evenly among all. This young man owns several shops and business, all of which went bankrupt. He leaves behind his wife and children behind in Vietnam.
 The authorities are not involved yet as private detectives were hired through family and friends. What are the possibilities or catching this scammer? What are your thoughts? Posting here before it makes the headlines.
