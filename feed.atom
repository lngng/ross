 Any help is highly appreciated.

I've considered going to Vietnam for 1mon to do so, but I'm not sure if it's a good fit culturally and logistically. Please share any experiences or insights.
 My main concerns are:
  
working time from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. - should I look for co-working spaces etc. or is it generally realistic to use the hotel WiFi? I don't need a lot of bandwidth, but it should be stable.
 
I'm autistic and while sensory-wise bustling cities and dense traffic are totally fine, I struggle with judgemental/high conformity culture, expectations of haggling and worst, being viewed as a "target". I have lived in China and Japan, which was okay since speaking the language mitigated most of the issues. Unfortunately, the reports about Vietnam I have read point towards exactly my issues being...well, an issue. What's the real deal here?
 
 I have studied some Vietnamese and should be able to reach a low intermediate level by the time I go there, if that helps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got married to a Viet girl recently and we argue about money a lot. I was born in Canada so my idea was that we would contribute equal percentage from our income for our shared expenses, and we handle the rest ourselves (to each their own money) - however she's not happy with it. She thinks that since I make more, I should contribute more than her since I will have a lot more money left. Is this the norm for a Viet girl? House chores we share 50/50 (I'd often do more because I want to) and everything else is equal but she won't budge about this part.
 Everyone is completely misunderstanding my point. We aren't doing the 50/50 split. I pay over 70% of everything. What I suggested was we both put half of our income into a shared account from which we would pay for our expenses. The idea of each of us having separate money to handle for ourselves was from her. The point here is that she thinks I should put more than half my money and she less so, so that what's left to each of us is more or less equal. She also wants to keep her job and not have children for at least another 7-8 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When i order food at non-english speakers 90% it works out just fine. But sometimes it is just not possible to communicate whatever options there are using gestures. The thing is, i am an adventurous eater and genuinely don't care what i get on my plate. The weirder the better. 
 So i'm looking for a phrase in vietnamese to express "I like everything" or "it does not matter, there is no food i don't like". Any help would be much appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At school I'm currently doing a unit on countries in the Francophonie, and first on the list is Vietnam. So from what we've discussed in class so far not a lot of people speak french, but it seems that it's still used to some degree by the government, which seems odd to me. But more importantly my teacher believes that french in Vietnam is like the language of power, you learn it if you want to be a politician and are seen as a power seeker if you're learning the language. This doesn't seem right to me based off of the basic knowledge of Vietnamese history I have, so am I right, is she wrong?

I was hoping someone could help me translate the two words below to help him during our lesson? Google translate won’t work for these, I think. 
 Will: the one that is someone’s last dying wish, not the verb 
 Work: as in ‘things will work out,’ not like a job or to work. If you could tell me how to say the sentence “we’ll find something that works” I’d also really appreciate that! 
 If anyone knows how to say these things in Vietnamese I’d be sooo grateful!

 I would like to get advice from you. I highly appreciate your polite comments and valuable advice. I've wanted to work as a freelance. I'm tired of working in the office with dramas and I'd like to be flexible so Freelance is my top choice. I've worked as an English teacher and content creator before. I am trying my best to learn more about digital marketing and photoshop for my future. 
 I created my Upwork account and tried my best to apply and get proposals but there was no result. I was upset a little bit. my parents are older and they often get sick so I'd like to push myself in working freelance. Should I still look for a job patiently or get some free work and then get a rate? 
 I can write English articles, create content on social media and get a good boost. Would you like to recommend me anything? I'm pleased to listen from you guys! Thanks in advance!
 Bonus: my house is noisy so I can't teach English at home or work as n English tutor. And I'd like to manage social media than teaching kids.

He is from Hanoi and I really want to learn vietnamese with the nothern accent but all apps seem to be in the southern accent, which is way different than what he speaks. I already learned a lot about his culture, and we often find a lot of similarities. He is very interested in mine and I want to show him how important he is to me as well! Thank you all🌸
 EDIT: I seemed to have open a big discussion 😭 I said/made this post because whenever I learn with my boyfriend, or try to practice myself I send him the things, thats when he tells me that they don't say it that way/ use different words or that the pronounciation is more southerly than northern. I don't ever want to offend anyone. I just want to be able to communicate with his mom!💗 thanks for the great advice!
