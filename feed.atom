        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a list of every country's most iconic cult film (list here: https://boxd.it/n5ZFs) and wondered if anyone could help me figure out Vietnam's entry. I'm looking for a film that might not be well-known outside the country's borders. Perhaps it's a film everyone knows, and is hugely popular only to Vietnamese audiences, even if it wasn't popular with critics. Or maybe it's a film that wasn't well-received by audiences or critics, but has gained a cult following in the years since its release. Any suggestions would be most welcome!

I found some rau ram at a nursery in a different state when I was visiting and decided to grow it to surprise her. She has a lot going on with her kids, so I am growing it for her. This is the first harvest!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The news that Vietnam will have 70 Michelin Guide honored restaurants in 2023 is encouraging and long overdue. Vietnam's unique culinary traditions, blending multiple regional styles with influences from China and France, produce some of the world's most iconic and delicious dishes.
 From pho to banh mi, spring rolls to imperial court cuisine, Vietnamese food withstands comparison with the finest culinary traditions anywhere. The creativity, skill and passion of Vietnamese chefs across the country have produced cooking that has long deserved global renown.
 Having 70 Michelin-reviewed establishments will help showcase the diversity and quality of Vietnam's dynamic restaurant scene to an international audience. It will attract more food tourists, boosting the hospitality industry and local economies. Most importantly, it provides deserved recognition for the craftsmanship and dedicated hard work of Vietnamese chefs over generations.
 As a Vietnamese, I have long taken for granted the pleasures of Vietnam's cuisine. But global acknowledgement from prestigious groups like Michelin will be a source of pride for Vietnamese people everywhere. It demonstrates that our culture's softest power - our food - can compete on the world stage. I hope this is just the beginning and that more Vietnamese culinary masters will have their talents spotlighted in the years to come.
 Vietnamese restaurants have earned their place amongst the finest in the world. I hope the Michelin Guide and other international reviewers will help spread the word and introduce more people to the joys of Vietnamese gastronomy. Our chefs deserve this honor - now it's time for the world to feast their eyes and taste buds on what Vietnam has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in and out of Vietnam quite a bit over the past year for work. I've been using Zalo to communicate to my driver and team members when I'm back at my apartment / out of the office (I don't have Facebook, so this was a good alternative while out here).
 Unfortunately, I had to replace my phone last time and Zalo put me through some loops to basically "re authenticate" me by having someone already in my Zalo contacts confirm it's me. Naturally, that happened a few days before I flew back out here, so I was unable to get in touch with anyone when I landed (didn't realize this was needed until I landed). I eventually got hold of someone and they did the in-person verification.
 However, ever since then, the Zalo app keeps telling me I need to "verify" my account. It has an option to upload a photo of your passport but it doesn't seem to like an American passport. Do I need to verify? How do I do this? Anyone have experience making it work?
 I tried to chat with Zalo support but they only would message me in Vietnamese. I really only use this to keep in touch with my team, does verify even matter?

 I am planning another out of country trip to Mexico in a few months as well and need my passport - in order to renew by mail you must send in your passport and I am worried it won't get back in time for my trip to Mexico. I don't want to send it after MX because there are so many delays with passports right now due to covid. Will it be fine?

 Phan Thi Kim Puc the girl in this photograph was 8 years old living in a small village in 1972 when it was shot. Doctors did not really give a chance to her looking at the severe burns on her body. However extensive surgery helped her to come through the ordeal. She later did her medicine in Cuba , where she met her future husband Bui Huy Toan. The couple later migrated to Canada , where they settled near Toronto. In 1997 she set up the Kim Phuc Foundation to help child victims of war. Truly remarkable lady.

 I am considering doing the ha giang loop on the back of an easy rider on my upcoming trip. Two main concerns I have are:
  
Is the weather in the region suitable for the tour during August?
 
I asked the tour guide people if a 130kg (im a big guy) person would be suitable to ride on these bikes with an easy rider, and they said “130 should be fine”
 
 Should?!
 I fully understand if I’m not able to go but that kind of animosity scares me haha. Should I ask again? is it too risky? 
 I would appreciate responses, thank you!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is mostly aimed at people living in Hanoi and the surrounding provinces. 
 As some of you may know, there is a power shortage that will continue throughout June. The official word is that power cuts will be occuring daily due to "El Nino". 
 Over the past week or so, my district (Long Bien) has experienced 5 outages that last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours at a time. We're told about them in the morning, so there isn't much time to plan around them as they start at 8 AM. 
 Tonight, we've been told (officially) that the outages will occur each day for the next month. In my 9 years living in Hanoi, I've never experienced this before, yes, occasionally power will cut during a typhoon, but never like this. 
 Does anyone else who is currently going through this have a backup generator? Is it worth investing in one? My wife and I run our business from home and we need to be online 24/7. We can't be out of the house for too long as we have 2 dogs that only pee outside and our son comes home for lunch and a nap each day. 
 Need advice on how to deal with it. Can't move because we own our property. Should I buy a generator? Have you heard any information about the power cuts that might shed more light than our building's manager has already? Do you know someone who works in the energy sector that has mentioned it to you? Feeling absolutely helpess RN.

Where do we look to live? We currently live in Hanoi on the lake, next to a park, lots of people gather and meet. We would love something similar. Places we have seen on listing that intrique us: Icon 56 building D2 Sanwah Pearl Golden River looks nice but no dogs. Suggestions welcome
 We want a mix of social, access to everything we want to buy, not overpriced but we aren't cheap, unique, where we can easily meet like singles and couples.

Is that right or am I missing something? Could a friend locally get a ‘top up’ receipt for my number that I could punch in with the SIM in my phone while being abroad?

They were all talking about how they rent apartments here for peanuts, and simply eat Bahn Mis and plow fresh young Vietnamese chicks on the daily.
 One guy buys like 100 pills of viagra and uses them all in under two months. He’s a lawyer and just has a broker who sends him up fresh meat multiple times a day.
 To be honest, it was kind of repulsive to hear about all this. I’ve been having a great time with the locals and it’s kind of nuts how all these women are getting used and abused by westerners. What do local Vietnamese think about this? They seem to be happy with throwing their daughters to the viagra popping wolves of the west.

We were stopped on numerous occasions and asked to take pictures - in Hanoi, in the terminal and on the ferry from Halong Bay, in particular. There was a language barrier so I wasn’t able to ascertain from the requesters as to why. When I asked those who did speak English, no one had an explanation. Can you help me?

 Mọi thứ cứ trôi qua êm đẹp như vậy, đi làm kiếm tiền như bao người. Cho đến khi vợ tôi nghỉ công tác tại ngân hàng M… Việc này làm tôi khá khủng hoảng về tinh thần khi làm ca kíp về và liên tục bị trì triết, phàn nàn về nhiều thứ. Và vợ tự sinh ra cái suy nghĩ nghỉ làm thành gánh nặng của tôi, mặc dù tôi cũng rất tán thành việc nghỉ nếu công việc quá áp lực và không hiệu quả về kinh tế. 
 Tôi chả biết do nghiệp hay duyên làm tôi có quen được 1 chị tiếp viên hơn tôi 3 tuổi vào đúng thời gian này. Không ai chủ động, chỉ nói chuyện về công việc rồi chia sẻ về cuộc sống, dần rà sau 1 tháng điều gì đến sẽ đến. Vâng, tôi có cãi nhau với vợ và rủ chị kia đi Hạ Long chơi và có qhtd. Ban đầu mục đích của tôi chỉ là giải toả căng thẳng, bằng một cách thần cmn kỳ xong chị ta yêu tôi. Rồi ngày qua ngày, việc chị ta cứ chia sẻ công việc (cùng ngành) mua đồ, quan tâm đến tôi cũng làm tôi có chút rung động :)
 Thực sự việc này tôi đã biết là sai ngay từ lúc rủ chị ta đi Hạ Long, tôi cũng vẫn rất yêu vợ mình chứ. Nhưng bản tính tham lam và râm tục của tôi làm tôi vẫn muốn giữ mối quan hệ này :( Chị ta cũng biết tôi có vợ và vẫn chấp nhận làm người thứ 3… Sau khi chia sẻ những lời này thì tôi vẫn đang có một gia đình đáng yêu và vẫn duy trì mqh ngoài luồng. Tôi sai rồi!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My parents and the older generation of my family, those who immigrated to the US, have always said that American and Western foods are always too salty or too sweet. They always say that too much salt or sugar is used. They also say this is why American food is so unhealthy.
 I’ve mainly been raised up in the US and eat both Asian and Western cuisines but never found this to be true. I’ve always found most foods to be reasonably seasoned to my tastes. I’ve asked friends and family around my age, and they also generally agree with me. I also believe the whole “American food is unhealthy” myth to be untrue because that really only applies to fast food which you really don’t eat on a daily basis. It’s also a huge over generalization of American cuisine considering how diverse each region and state is. I digress though. Is it really true that Vietnamese/Asian cuisine use less salt/sugar and are healthier than American/Western cuisine, or is this more of a subjective to taste thing?

 I’m looking to see if there is any sort of Hip Hop scene in Saigon? Have it be gigs, shops, painters, dancers, rappers and singer, anything really. I’m a street artist here in Australia and found a bit of a scene last year in Hanoi, so surely there is something going in in Saigon. 
 Also, looking to go and see some good live music, both traditional and if there is any contemporary gigs. I’ve found the opera which will be great to go to. But I’m open to anything really! Also if there is any race scene at all? I’ve found a few clubs that have potential like Arcan. 
 Thanks in advanced everyone. I’m so excited to be back in Vietnam next week!!!

 I actually got along really well with my girl, and we talked quite a bit (a lot of it using google translate). After everything was said and done, I was gathering my belongings, I asked her what she recommended I do for fun in Hanoi. On google translate she said, "I don't know, I only stay here" and she had kind of a weird look on her face.
 It was kind of strange, like she just looked at me for a moment, the continued dressing me.

Mainly I need help with the name. I'm trying to come up with a name that would utilize the Vietnamese word for descent; the name would be made by splitting up the word into syllables that could then be used to create a full name (ex: like the word danger being used to create the name daniel criminger). Unfortunately, I do not know a lick of Vietnamese. 
 I'm struggling with two things: 
 A) I'd like to be able to find a correct translation of the Vietnamese word for descent. I've tried a bunch of websites including Google Translate and ChatGPT and they all come up with different answers and 
 B) I'd like to be able to come up with a realistic name, something that actually sounds believable, if that makes sense. I'm sorry if it's a large request but any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

 My wife’s bà nội died suddenly, we won’t be able to make it to Vietnam in time for the funeral. 
 She’s already burned some incense at our tiny shrine. But she’s not practising and does this stuff more out of habit than anything else.
 What could I do on the day of the funeral to mark my respect? I was thinking to print a picture of her and get a small bouquet of white lilies and putting them on the shrine. Is that appropriate?

 A few thoughts I have are the quality of childcare, the quality of life, and what are your opinions in regards to the activites/culture in general. With so much respect to Vitetnam, I ask this with cost/life analysis perspective in mind-- how are things there?

 EDIT: Some people are asking how this relates to r/vietnam, I just wanted some more Việt Kiều/mainlander perspectives to see if there’s something I’m missing in navigating this mess. 
 We had seen the first one together and they enjoyed it, so I thought they might like this. But they clearly didn’t, and even talked badly about it during the movie. EDIT: It was too artsy and chaotic for them. Too much going on.
 It’s okay if they didn’t like it since we are worlds apart when it comes to media consumption. I just hate that they didn’t at least stay and experience the movie with me and my brother. It had been a while since we had gone out to the movie theaters as a family.
 To make it worse, my brother is very hot tempered and told them to shut up several times while they were critiquing the movie, and even as they were walking out. I get where his frustration is coming from, but I don’t agree with how disrespectful he was. 
 They waited for us outside in the car. On the ride home, I tried to keep the conversation light even if I was slightly annoyed. 
 But the tension was clear. And when they confronted my brother about snapping at them, they all started yelling at each other. 
 We just got home and there was a lot of door slamming. I feel really sad. If I had known the evening would end this way, I would have just gone to see the movie myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 👋 My boyfriend and I are working on applying to jobs in Vietnam, starting this week. Before we do this, we are sorting out our CVs and cover letters.
 I am a qualified English teacher with a 4-year Education degree specializing in English language. I have 6 years of experience in the industry.
 My boyfriend is a graphic designer and photographer and holds a 3-year bachelor degree in the above field, he has a 180-hour TEFL course certification and has 7 years experience. 
 He is designing our CVs from scratch, to suit our specific aesthetic wants. I have some questions regarding what Vietnamese schools might look for in a CV/what is considered professional:
 • He is holding a chihuahua in his head shot, it is a professional and very striking photo. Would this be considered strange to a Vietnamese recruiter?
 • My CV is working with a colour palette of pink and grey, are there better colours I could choose that recruiters might find more appealing or make my CV stand out more?
 • What are some specific categories in CVs that recruiters look at?
 • Is there any way we can strengthen our chances/make our CVs stand out from the rest?
 Thank you so much, this subreddit is a godsend.

 Porn is illegal in Vietnam. How do they even enforce that? Customs confiscates your devices for a thorough inspection? The government tracks your internet activity?

Cost: Will the wedding cost similar at both locations? Assuming similar type of venue and decoration. 
 
Weather: preferably we want outdoor wedding. From our initial search, it may rain in DaNang in December? 
 
Venue availability in December: DaNang seem to be busy with tourists during December 
 
 Main reason for considering DaNang/ Hoi An is half of the guests are non Vietnamese and these locations are unique to Vietnam. Since they are traveling to Vietnam, and may not travel again in future DaNang/ Hoi An has more cultural and tourist things todo. We might be wrong, but we don’t see something similar in or nearby Ho Chi Minh City. We would like your opinion/ suggestions.

 I'm travelling through vietnam right now and I was looking for advice from some viet natives. I am solo travelling and just can't seem to meet people and have remotely lengthy conversations. I keep trying but it doesn't seem to be working. I'm currently in hanoi (old quarter). I've been walking around all day, searching online and trying to find events or language exchange communities. Looking online everyone seems to be saying its super easy to meet people here so I don't know why I'm struggling. I am usually very confident talking to people back home, but it seems this language barrier is impeding me more than others.
 Any advice would be much appreciated as I'm a very social person and tend to be far happier when with people.

 Also is 1M the usual fee in Vietnam per session? Would therapists ever offer, idk, like a combo price or something? It just doesn't seem very proportionate to the average wage here.

 I prepared 
 Baguette 
 Cucumber Cilantro Pickled Carrot/radish
 Vietnamese Ham 
 Cholimex hot sauce / mayo/ butter 
 Can you recommend me some ingredients to make better banh mi? Is this basic ingredient rigth?

 I am looking for a way to travel from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi by bus.
 I searched for buses on google through baolau, vexere, and sinhtourist, but none of them go directly from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi.
 The only way I can find is to get off in Da Nang or Hue and then book a new ticket.
 I've seen information that Mailinh Express runs this route, but when I look it up on their website, it says there are no buses.
 Can someone tell me how to get from Ho Chi Minh - Hanoi directly without any transfers?
 Thank you.

I am currently attending one but because I can’t speak Vietnamese I feel like I’m slowing everyone else down and they have to put a lot of effort into accommodating me. It’s made things a little difficult.
 If anyone knows of any gyms where expats go or are used to training expats that would be great.
 Im also open to regular boxing. So if anyone knows any good expat gyms that do that too, I'd love to hear it

  Also, my roof has been leaking. I have a bucket to collect most of the water, but I need to empty it and mop the floor every time it rains. I've been asking them to fix it for a month or reduce my rent but now I just want to leave. 
 I pay too much for this to be my reality. I only moved here because it was pet friendly, but my cat died 2 months ago. I'm off work for one month and would like to move while I have time, but they will not break my contact without keeping my security deposit, even if I feel the spirit of my contract is broken. How do I break the lease and get my money back so I can move? Am I shit out of luck? Cheers thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I've heard that the installlation fee, maintenance fee, operation fee of having Air Conditioners (AC) in some western countries costs an arm and leg. And people in some countries in Europe don't have AC at home, according to some of my friends in France, Spain and UK.
 Sales of portable air-conditioning units rose 2,420 percent in a week, British retailer Sainsbury’s said during the hot season last year. Some in Europe are coming to accept that some AC usage may be needed to save lives. After a heat wave killed an estimated 15,000 people in France in 2003, air conditioning was introduced to some nursing homes in a bid to protect the most vulnerable. 
 How do you guys feel about AC in Vietnam, where the prices are cheap and almost every household in urban cities like Hanoi or Saigon has at least one. AC in hot nation like Vietnam is true love or a threat to the environment?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Vietnamese passport expired a few years ago and I want to renew it. I looked it up on the NY consulate website and it looks like for expired passport renewal you basically have to apply for a new one. But the forms for that asks a lot about pre-immigration life such as where I lived, why I left, any and all relative information including their addresses, etc. And I don’t have all this information since I moved here when I was super young and I don’t know all my relatives especially their Vietnamese names and addresses. More importantly the forms are all in Vietnamese so I’m assuming I’d have to answer in Vietnamese but I don’t speak/read/write Vietnamese. I’ve tried calling the NY consulate but haven’t gotten through to them. Looking for any advice to make this process easier

Is that reasonable? The other thing I was wondering was whether I could just book a grab from the airport to our hotel in Tam Coc or is that going to be a trip most won't take?

 I'm currently looking for a teaching job in Vietnam, i sent my application to some centers though while waiting i wanted to try applying for jobs on Facebook groups yet i felt like it could be risky. 
 Most offers there are "some locals" looking for teachers and not actual schools/centers, it seemed not legit to me but what i know is that everything works differently in Vietnam, right? 
 My question is, how legit are those offers? Is there anyone here that was hired this way through a local on facebook? 
 I would appreciate your help.

 So a diverse answer is okay. Whenever you live in any city
 You can also give your personal range of cost of living as a person living by himself/herself
 I want to know or to be as grounded as possible on how natives live their life every day

 Do most Vietnamese mothers spank?
 Growing up in the United States, it was one of those things that was usually considered private and only discussed with close friends so I honestly cannot even give an answer for how common it is in The United States (perhaps she will have a similar honest answer).
 In the United States, I would say that it about half and half (but that is only from my experience).

 I'm planning a journey for myself and husband. We're first-time travellers to Vietnam this year in late August / early September. Any tips for off the beaten track tours of 1 or 2 days on the Mekong Delta? We're used to road-trips and bumping into authentic experiences with people, a local guide in this case will probably give us insights we wouldn't otherwise have. I found something by Innoviet and Local-insider, but I still don't know if that is what we're looking for. Any tips will be much appreciated.

 Probably a long shot 
 I'm trying to find back a restaurant that I just loved when I was here the last time in 2018.
 It was right in front of the Lapis hotel on Tran Hung Dao (the avenue with all the embassies). Best banh xeo I've ever had + a bunch of other worthy dishes.
 Unexplainably now they put a fake teppanyaki fusion restaurant instead.
 I asked the girl at the entrance and she told me it might have moved to Le Duan Street - but I'm not sure if she actually understood that I was looking for that specific restaurant.
 Does anybody here know the name? 
 If not I'll take other good banh xeo suggestions too (in Hanoi)
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Viet Nam!
 Over the last year or two, I've been coming across articles about how major smartphone manufacturers have been increasingly shifting operations towards India and Viet Nam.
 As you know, China has been pretty much the "factory of the world" over the last 2 decades and her socioeconomic transformation has been astounding over the same period to say the least. Sadly, I was too young to pay attention then.
 Because of a rapidly aging population and diminishing workforce, cost of labour in China has risen exponentially. Coupled with constant, multi-front geopolitical tensions, one can understand why having operations in China faces a diminishing risk-reward ratio.
 Looking at Vietnam's Balance of Trade, I see that it's surged post-2015, around the time the protectionist Trump administration got elected - which I suppose accelerated the trend of de-coupling from China. However, the Vietnamese Dong seems to be facing a constant weakening, unlike that of an export hub. Somehow, I never see reports about how these winds are affecting regular Vietnamese citizens.
 Have you noticed a surge in manufacturing activity in Viet Nam?
 If so, how has this impacted you? 
 Has the surge been driven by MNCs setting up their own plants, or have they been subcontracting to local manufacturers?
 Also, have these factories been concentrated in particular regions and therefore limited in benefit?
 Do you think Viet Nam will experience the same breakneck growth in the next decade as China did?
 I'm excited to hear the perspectives of people living through the change!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a beach festival is going on now in Nha Trang. It's suppose to start on the 3rd of June (according to the receptionist), but they have already practicing from the 30th of May. I don't mind the noise if it's until 22:00, heck even 00:00 is fine. But it's 01:50 AM and those motherfuckers are still singing and blasting EXTREMELY LOUD music. Nobody was able to sleep. Many tourists and visitors are staying near the beach, around the area. There are many hotels. Many have toddlers that need to sleep early. Many have tours that start as early as 7am-8am in the morning.
 Tried to call the police for the noise pollution and they're useless. "Oops we can't do anything uwu" 😑. Heard a similar situation happened in Nha Trang during Tet as well. Is this only in Nha Trang specifically or does it occurred in other cities in Vietnam as well? 
 Update: The Khanh Hoa province posted this news today in the 31st of May, to remind everyone about the laws and rules.
 https://khanhhoa.gov.vn/vi/tin-tuc-noi-bat/phong-chong-vi-pham-phap-luat-trong-hoat-dong-van-hoa-the-thao-va-du-lich-3005
 Noise pollution is illegal in Vietnam and organisers have to follow the laws created by the Vietnam government. If laws are broken and not being followed, expecting some fine.
 "Kết quả, Thanh tra Bộ Văn hóa, Thể thao và Du lịch đã xử phạt vi phạm hành chính đối với 5 tổ chức, cá nhân có hành vi vi phạm với tổng số tiền xử phạt 340.000.000 đồng."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve got a month off in August/September, flying in and out of HCMC. This will be my first time in South East Asia, so I’m looking for some recommendations for some less touristy places to see. I prefer nature activities, hiking, historical landmarks, temples etc over cities and urban areas. Would love to be able to do some hiking, and I’m also looking into the Ha Giang loop, but otherwise very open to suggestions.

I always try to smile and Learn the language, at least to say “please” “thanks” “hello” “very good” etc. In HCMC starts with some yelling and pointing fingers and laughing. In Da Lat some being attended with angry looks. In Nha Trang at the bus counter they even don’t want to sell me the tickets for my next destination and turning the face like I wasn’t there… at the hotel, the manager, was asking me if I taken something from the “minibar” ( literally 4 Pepsi cans ) 4 time in a row aggressively and threatening with checking the room…. Should I assume that’s the treatment that I’ll have all around the country? Of course there where people that wanted to help, but at the moment seems they are the minority… and please don’t read this as pointing fingers or in any bad way. As I said I just want to understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I´m using the "Assimil" language course book for self study to learn Vietnamese. 
 Yesterday tho, I watched a video about the usage of Vietnamese pronouns by Tieng Viet Oi, which is a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching Vietnamese, and they explained the use of the pronouns in a completely different way than my course book uses them!
 Now I feel insecure and I don´t know, if I should keep on using my course book, because I don´t want to learn this major part of the language in a wrong way! I don´t doubt, that the infos given by Tieng Viet Oi are wrong, because they´re native speakers, but maybe my book uses rules that they left out? I don´t know! Can you native speakers out there tell me, if this use of the pronouns makes any sense, or if my course book isn´t a good source?
 ​
 1.Dialogue:
 Person1, Stranger: calls other cô / Person2, stranger: calls other ông - formal setting
 2.Dialogue
 Person1, waiter: calls other bà / Person2, customer: calls other ông - restaurant order
 3.Dialogue
 Person1, knows other person, not closest friends: calls other anh / Person2, same as other: calls other chi (dot under i) - colloquial talk
 ​
 --> also the book explains the pronouns as:
 -cô: young women or women who aren´t married
 -ông: men older than 40 years
 -bà: elderly women or married women
 -anh/chi(dot): people you know and that are around your age
 ​
 (it doesn´t really consider the relationship between the speaker and the other person!)
 ​
 I´m sorry for the long post! I´d really appreciate any adivce, because I fell in love with the Vietnamese language and I just want to keep on studying! Thanks a lot and have a wonderful day!

Obviously that has all changed, all of our plans have been cancelled so essentially starting from scratch except for the flights from Europe to Asia. It’s 3 weeks so was planning Hanoi, Chiang Mai, Koh Samui and Hoi An. Honestly my main worry is that I could be days not talking to people and be lonely. I’m introverted as is my partner but we always had each other, we are very friendly but in short conversations normally. I’m a bit lost as to what to do and half considering just not going and losing the money on the flights and maybe doing shorter trips around Europe. From being in a relationship so long it’s almost like you lose confidence alone I think and rely on the other person.

 Do you know anyone who has done this? If so, I’d love to talk with them about the challenge so I can be as prepared as possible. 
 Id like to raise money for children in need here in Vietnam. What charities do you think need the most support?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I hope this is allowed. My partner and I are planning on moving to Vietnam in 2024 to teach. We’re from South Africa. We are aware that the school year starts around April but we would like to come sooner (Jan/Feb). We are considering volunteering through WorkAway for the first few months before trying to find jobs. We’re wondering how the visa process works: are we still only allowed to stay for 30 days on a tourist visa or is it possible to obtain an extended visa with the help of a host from WorkAway? Or will we have to do visa runs? Because we’re planning on finding jobs while in Vietnam, we’d also like to know what documents we’ll need to apply for jobs and obtain a long stay visa. We’d really appreciate any info and advise! TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I'm going to Vietnam soon (I'm American) to meet my Vietnamese girlfriend's family. We've been together for a while and we're getting married soon. The thing is, her family might not be too accepting of our relationship because they have super traditional views. Her family matters to her a lot, and I want to give them a good impression (or at least not a horrible one). 
 Any tips or suggestions on how I can approach this? Her family doesn't come from wealth, so I was thinking of giving a hundred or so USD dollars to each member of her close family (though I don't come from wealth either, a hundred goes a lot further over there than it does in the USA, and I thought it might be a good small amount), a couple nice gifts from America, and then of course showing respect and kindness at all times. 
 But to be honest, I'm not sure where to go from there. Is there anything I can do to make them really like me despite their traditional views? Or at least even out the scale of hate vs. like haha?

 Another thing I found unique about Vietnam is that these big signs show food names rather than business names. 
 This makes me wonder: are these signs designed and subsidised by some government agency? Was there a government program that made all food signs look similar to reach other?

 I have several nieces and nephews in the 12-15 age range in south of Rach sỏi, along the delta. I wanted to send them each a story book to help with their interest in reading. I was thinking a Vietnamese translation of the Harry Potter series, but thought I’d ask here to see if there might be some other local recommendations that the kids may have better resonance with. (I’d have my aunt procure them locally, as she lives in rạch giá).
 Thanks!

 I’d like to do a special mother-in-law/son-in-law dance at the western reception, but it’s hard to find a suitable song. I want to find a song in Vietnamese for a slow dance that is appropriate coming from a son-in-law. Many songs about mothers talk about the mother raising the singer, which isn’t genuine to our relationship. I’m hoping to find a song whose lyrics work coming from me.
 Do you know of any sweet, heartfelt songs in Vietnamese that are about a mother-in-law? Or about a mother, but without focusing on how the mother raised the singer? Or a song about an amazing, strong person without any romantic subtext?
 My fiancée’s cousin helped me find Mẹ Yêu by Đỗ Phú Quí, which sounds perfect, but reading a translation of the lyrics, seems to focus too much on how the mother raised the singer. But maybe the sentiment would still work?
 Thank you for helping me make the day special for my (soon-to-be) mother-in-law!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My cousin and I are planning a trip to southeast Asia from mid-November thru early December. Most likely a November 14 departure and a December 3-4 return. We are both guys in our mid/late 20s from Los Angeles. We like nature (hiking + excursions), nature sightseeing, large cities, food, and partying.
 We were set on doing 2 weeks in Thailand but are now considering adding 4-5 days in Vietnam due to the recommendations of many family members & friends.
 Our initial plan was to do 3-5 days in Bangkok & Pattaya and then travel south for the remainder of the trip to see Phuket and Koh Phi Phi.
 So my main question is this: If we have 4-5 days, how would you recommend we spend it in Vietnam? Bangkok and Hanoi? Is it possible to truly experience these 2 major Vietnamese cities in that short of time? Should we omit one? Maybe reduce some of our time in Thailand?
 I understand there are dozens of great places we'll be missing... But I am hoping some seasoned travelers or residents of either country can give feedback/advice. It is MUCH appreciated!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Thanh Lam, Vietnam leads the world in cyber abuse to cheat and violate the law.
 At the Multi-Channel Management Networking Workshop on the morning of May 27 in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Nguyen Thanh Lam said:
 "For every 100 dong earned from cheating on YouTube, there are 55 dong of Vietnamese users. We are at the top of the list for copyright infringement. There is a football livestream channel that violates copyright like Xoi Lac TV. There is a channel that buys Japanese porn, cuts it into many short clips, and then packs it and sells it to the American audience."
 Lam said the country in second place in the ranking accounts for only 5% of fraudulent income, one-tenth of Vietnam. Last week, Apple also announced to remove more than 8,000 infringing applications originating in Vietnam, many of which are content creation applications.
 The deputy minister said that this is a sad record, exposing the fact that besides positive content, many creators still do business and make money regardless. Part of the responsibility lies with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook when they can't control the content and users on the platform. Advertisers also have a responsibility to still spend money on dirty content.
 "The state does not prevent businesses from wanting to advertise in cyberspace, but it is impossible for a money to flow into malicious content that businesses still see as normal," Mr. Lam said.

 We are 3 girls planning a quick getaway trip to Hanoi and Cat Ba island from 28th September-2nd October. Unfortunately we are short on time and so we have planned this itinerary:
 ​
 - Land in Hanoi on 28th Morning, leave directly for Cat Ba, stay in a resort/hotel
 - Leave Cat Ba on 30th Morning, come back to Hanoi, get an AirBnB in/near Old Quarter
 - Checkout on 2nd morning and take the evening flight back to our country
 ​
 I read alot of posts on travelling to Hanoi/Vietnam and I am honestly with too much information and figured it would be better to ask here. Please help me out!
  
Is Cat Ba Island worth it? We wanted to avoid the crowd in Ha Long Bay, but stay near the sea and relax. 
 Any suggestions for Cat Ba, like places to eat/ things to do/ places to stay?
 Best way to travel from Hanoi to Cat Ba and back?
 For Hanoi, we have Egg Coffee, Bahn Mi (and a lot more food items) and Beer Street on our list already, but any hidden/hole in the wall places that are away from commercial tourism would be great to know. Very open to trying authentic vietnamese food and drinks!! 
 Any suggestions for a reputable spa experience in Cat Ba or Hanoi are most welcome
 Any suggestions for where to go for a party in Hanoi? We will be there during the weekend
  
Thank you for taking the time out to read this and so sorry if its a long post!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many of you, I am increasingly concerned by the hate and hostility that I see every day in this beautiful community, especially between Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans. 😔 
 It is my firm believe that in our time and age, nothing is more important than mutual respect and understanding. So, in this spirit, I propose a new Vietnamese flag that symbolizes the indestructible friendship between the North and South; a new flag free of bad connotations; a flag that combines the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam. 
 As we strive to foster stronger connections between Vietnamese wherever they may reside or what they believe, it is essential to have a symbol that represents our shared values of friendship and understanding; representing multiculturalism, love, diversity, respect and mutual understanding 🤝🌍
 https://preview.redd.it/002tzmjnop2b1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4fee59796edb5dd67668bdff04b4be0a250ccd22
 This proposed flag aims to honor Vietnam's rich cultural heritage and traditions (blue) and emphasizes the significance of unity and cooperation (red). The Golden Star represents the everlasting bond between Vietnam's people and their striving for greatness and prosperity for all Vietnamese people, regardless of their geographical location or political stances.
 With my loving heart, I invite every one of you to print this flag out, show it to your parents and especially grandparents and display it proudly in your windows. Let's propagate the message of love and friendship. Because only as an undivided ONE we can overcome the hate that has tormented this beautiful land for far too long ❤️❤️❤️❤️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planning a trip to ho chi minh for 7 days. Is it way too long? Seems like you can travel the entire Vietnam for that time if you touch and go however it's my first time there and I don't want to stress myself out by taking a loooooong train or bus ride (I get motion sickness). The flight is already booked so we have to start and end at hcmc no matter what. 
 What do you recommend? Should I 
  
Take it easy and stay entire week in HCMC and go for day trips to cu chi and mekong delta etc
 
Travel to danang/hoi an via plane/train. Will it be too tiring to go there and back to hcmc in 7 days?
 
Spend the time in South Vietnam, going furthest to muine/nha trang?
 
 Or anything in between? 
 Also, are the roads super difficult to cross? I have huge anxiety about this and when I cross the road usually use traffic lights so I'm super unconfident.
 Also, I'm going in august.. read that it's the rainy season. Should I give up on seeing the beach entirely?

 Just curious what my options are for attempting to do this with my fiancé comfortably able to sit on the back (ideally able to strap a backpack to the back as well).
 5 years ago I drove from Hanoi to Saigon via motorbike (without a doubt the greatest travel experience of my life).
 But now I am coming back for a long honeymoon and what to do the Ha Giang Loop which I sadly missed last time around.
 I own a 1000cc motorcycle back home, and have obviously quite a bit of experience driving in Vietnam in previous trips. However, with a second person attached to the back this gets a bit trickier.
 I want something that will comfortable seat both of us for long stints of the drive, and ideally I want to rent this time and not purchase. What do you guys recommend?

 I am planning a 16 days trip to North and Central Vietnam this December. Flying into Hanoi and out from Da Nang. 
 I have shortlisted these places.
 Hanoi,
 Ha Long Bay,
 Sapa,
 Ninh Binh,
 Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park,
 Hue,
 Hoi An
 Da Nang.
 16 days is definately too short to visit them all yea? Which one should I miss if so.
 I love nature, history and culture but am also a budget traveler.
 Sorry if I posted at the wrong subreddit.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Vietnam has been making strides in the world of technology and innovation. With the rise of start-ups and the increasing number of high-tech companies moving their branch offices to Vietnam, is there a possibility that Vietnam, this Southeast Asian nation, could become the next start-up nation in Asia?
 The shift from China to Vietnam has been noticeable, with companies such as Samsung, LG, and Intel all establishing a strong presence in Vietnam. This trend is not limited to just large corporations, as start-ups are also finding success in Vietnam's growing tech scene.
 One reason for Vietnam's appeal is its young and highly educated population. According to the World Bank, nearly 60% of Vietnam's population is under the age of 35, and the country boasts a literacy rate of over 95%. This has created a strong talent pool for tech companies to draw from.
 Another factor contributing to Vietnam's potential as a start-up nation is its favorable business environment. The Vietnamese government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurship. The country has also made significant improvements in infrastructure, including expanding its internet connectivity and investing in new technology parks.
 However, there are still challenges that Vietnam must overcome in order to fully realize its potential as a start-up nation. One major hurdle is the lack of venture capital funding available for start-ups. While the government has taken steps to address this issue, more needs to be done in order to attract investment and support the growth of new businesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I am making plans to visit Vietnam for the first time, landing in Hanoi and planning to spend around a month here. I would love to visit HCMC and do the hiang loop also.
 My concern is with the street dogs that I have seen online in the SEA countries especially in Thailand and I was wondering what the reality of the situation is in Vietnam.
 I am at the level where if I see a dog I will cross the road or go the other way.
 I’ve heard that pretending to pick up a rock and holding a stick / umbrella is good defence.
 Is it realistic for me to have a good time in Vietnam (especially if most my time will be on group tours and city) with the dog population?
 Mainly my fear is with dogs off lead and more so feral/wild/street dogs in packs.
 Thank you very much and apologies for the errors question, I know that dog phobia is not common and that most people love dogs - trust me I do too but I cannot lie about the reality that I fear dogs.

 Now, as a first time traveler to vietnam, I will have never taken one of the buses there. Is a flight booked for 13:05 cutting it to close considering the possibility of delays? Would 14:00 be a safer bet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been thinking about visiting Saigon/ HCM City this July (would be my first time in Vietnam) but I'm kinda worried about the humidity, the heat and the rain. 
 From what I've seen the weather seems to be more bearable than in Hanoi but I'm not quite sure in how far it would allow me to do sightseeing and stuff throughout the day.
 So I was wondering if someone could tell me about the personal experiences in Saigon around this time of year. Do tourists usually visit there in summer? Do public buildings, restaurants and trains have AC? Do locals spend time outside during the day or do they usually try to stay inside?
 Pretty much what I wanna know is if I'll be able to have a good time despite the warm weather and rain. I live in Europe and the climate here is quite different from SE Asia, so apologies if some of my questions come across as naive or uneducated. 
 Either way, I know there's no definitive answer to this, but any helpful advice is much appreciated!

As many people said it kinda disturbing bc things like that in their country consider as animal abuse immediately but in VietNam it a dangerous environment in the city if you let your cat roam outside. Also about the physical interact that look like slap actually is a pat but Im not sure bc it a child hit💀. Cats can easily accident unalived by many reasons in my country but I not support thing like that, it just most necessary still depend on the owner and the situation.

 Just wondering what was going on with that?
 PS. He threw the hat in front of the meter and I could still see the fare in the reflection of the windshield. It started off at 10k and rose very slowly. Then randomly jumped to 500k, 1 million before reaching 2 million by the end. The fare ended up being 41k on grab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to remember something one of my ex-girlfriends use to call me.
 I think it's this word, "Dâm tặc".
 I think this word means "horny dog" or something about being horny. However when I Google translate it says that it means thieves.
 Could someone confirm to me that "Dâm tặc" can mean horny? I'm not 100% sure if this is the word she use to call me, I just Googled how I think it was spelled and it came up.
 Thanks in advance~!

 I have been living in Can Tho since 2011. The city once was really nice, but lately I feel unwelcome and uncomforable here. What I experienced this morning confirms my feelings the more.
 I work self-employed, so I can manage my time. Every morning I take a walk (actually, I want to jog, but the heat...). So I am walking down Nguyen Viet Hong, turn then into a small hem and come out at Le Lai. From there I need to cross the Pham Van Tri and enter the park (Luu Huu Phuoc). Easy. I've been doing it for a long time.
 This morning, when I approached the corner Le Lai/Pham Van Tri, a young Vietnamese, apparently agitated, was standing there. He threw with things onto the cars and motorbikes. I must have looked bewildered. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked part-time at a hotel for a few months (as a second job so that I could make a little extra money).
 My co-worker (22 year-old Vietnamese woman who recently graduated from College) came up to me and gave me a $10 Starbucks card on my last day of work.
 I was surprised as her and I got along well when we worked together (but we rarely saw each other/rarely worked together as it is a big hotel).
 I am a 40-year old man and have had many jobs and this is the first time that a co-worker has done this. I think it is very nice.
 Her and I have contact on Linkedin.
 I don't mean to "keep score", but there is something nice that I would like to do for her. Suggestions?
 As an aside: At work I was busy and I never paid much attention to her. In looking back she was very hard working and kind. I have travelled to Japan, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Laos, South Korea, Malaysia and Kong Kong but for some reason I overlooked Vietnam. She got me thinking of Vietnam and I have since developed an interest in travelling there and have read many good things about Vietnamese women.
 Obviously I am not going to be in a relationship with her (not likely with any Vietnamese American for that matter: even in big/diverse cities the Vietnamese are likely less than 1% of the population and moving to Vietnam is not an option).
 Still nice to know that such people exist however.

 Are there other platforms (that operate/are based in Vietnam) that take international-based credit cards? I'm open to opening a bank account with international banks like HSBC if that helps. As mentioned in the title, I also have CCND and can open a Vietnamese-based bank account, but I'm not too sure how the process works.

 I'm thinking about taking the ~12 days guided motorcycle trip to Hanoi then flying back, that sounds simply amazing. But good alternatives would be spending some more time in the city and taking my time in the south instead. I love a good hike or some local culture and would hate to rush things.
 What would be your thoughts on how best to spend the time?

 I'm (33) Australian my wife (30) is Vietnamese lived here since 18 years old. We've been married for 6.5 years together for 10. 
 I've been to Vietnam many times and I love it, when we touch down in Saigon I start getting an almost 'coming home' vibe. My Viet language skills are actually not too bad, so I can get around by myself, order my own food, shopping, basic conversation. 
 Anyway, my in laws are coming here for a visit, it's winter so doing some of the really great Australian outdoor type activities, so we are gonna take them out for dinners, some shows etc. We have planned for a weekend away in a cottage in the countryside with some of my family. Now my in laws speak next to zero english, and my family speak no Viet. 
 I'm just wondering if anyone might have some suggestions for some good activities we could enjoy together without having to rely to heavily on my wife to translate constantly. Like some games or activities or board games etc. We can do while enjoying a couple of beers by the fireplace. Hopefully someone out there has some suggestions, I just want them to feel like they're participating with us rather than just observers.
 Thanks ☺️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just landed at in HCMC. Wanted to share some things I saw for foreigners in terms of how to get into town with zero stress taking a grab.
 1) Go through customs, Exit international terminal. Look for the green umbrella tents across the street. 100 yards max. cant miss them. 5-6 large green umbrellas. I dont ever remember seeing these before. 
 2) open grab and use the green umbrella area as your pick up spot.
 it should cost you 125k dong to get into D1. Grab will add 15k for the airport toll. Total bill should be about 140k + any surge. The driver pays the toll.
 Waiting for grab at 6am = 10 mins
 ride to D1 took 15-20 mins.
 Cost was 140k dong which is like 7 bux. and best was ZERO stress of being ripped. had 3-4 taxi guys approach and follow me to grab area.

 I was wanting to fly somewhere fun and interesting this winter for vacation and I was interested in visiting Vietnam for it's connection to Cold War history even after the Vietnam War.
 However, when looking at tickets for Vietnam through Expedia, I noticed that they aren't the cheapest.
 Being a college student on a budget, I was kind of curious if anyone here has a preferred airline they fly with when it comes to Vietnam whether it is to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City?
 Thanks in advance everyone!

 I can't ask my friend because it's a surprise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foodie friend asked me to help ask around...
 La Maison 1888 is the French fine dining restaurant of Intercontinental Hotel Da Nang. This hotel is a 30 minute car ride away from the main beach because it is on the far end of the coast, and it does not allow Grab pickups out of the hotel. The restaurant is built into an old villa on a cliff, overlooking the water, and is very beautiful. They emphasize that they have the only 3 Michelin star French chef working there, and claim to be the #1 food destination in Vietnam. (Tasting menu is VND4-5M.)
 The advertising feels scammy because there is no such thing as a Michelin star chef. They claim the chef helped design the menu and he runs a 3 Michelin star restaurant in Paris, which is not the same thing and he is not in the Da Nang restaurant. Vietnam will only get Michelin rated retaurants in 2023, and only in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. There are very few blog reviews about the restaurant, and their TripAdvisor and Google Maps reviews do not imply that this is a legendary must try before you die place.
 Can Vietnam foodies comment?

 In the past decade, I've grown to truly appreciate and love the heritage my family has provided me with their hard work and successes. Every day it's great to know their sacrifices have provided my family its great opportunities. I joke about how I could be a farmer if they never left lol. Several years spent in the military and now I'm working within one of the biggest international companies.

 I was an international student in the US and I have been back living in Vietnam for 2 years. Back in US I had no problem driving a car, not gonna say that I’m skilled but I can drive I can do most parking and drive on freeway, but I have so much harder time learning to drive a scooter :( 
 For the most part I am able to drive normally on the road but I find it so hard park in small narrow parking spaces, sometimes there are security men help me sometimes there are not, and in those times when there is no one to help, I have fallen 3 times due to sudden brake when the gas was still on (the place so narrow I was afraid I’m gonna hit objects so I hit brake too sudden) And now I am starting to feel a bit fearful of driving :(

 First of all I spent 6 weeks in Vietnam and absolutely loved it the people are emazing, countryside beautiful as well as amazing food. I would love to revisit and go to the parts I didn't have time to see. 
 Im posting on here because I'm looking for a friend I met on a night out in Hanoi on the 4th May called Patrick who is Swedish. I'm female from the UK, we had a great time when we met but we didn't get chance to exchange any contact details. I think he's still in Vietnam in HCMC, I'm now not. If you're on here hit me up, it would be nice to see what you are up to. Absolute long shot and very unlikely they are on here (I probably won't ever find him.) 
 (I'm not sure if this is allowed on here and I will delete if not. Before I get any hate I understand that there are hundreds and thousands of tourists in Vietnam. Just thought I'd see if I could reconnect)

 We immigrated to the USA in the mid 1990s and all became US citizens over the next 10-20 years. I'm trying to resolve a USA pension related issue for my parents and it has been a nightmare because they didn't keep copies of the forms that I need. Pretty much the only significant documentation I've gotten from them is my refugee card and my Certificate of Citizenship.
 I'm tried pretty much everything I can think of to prove their marriage status but unfortunately:
 1) They never owned property
 2) They don't have a copy of their last joint tax filing (which would be 2015 or 2016). I'm currently trying to track down where they filed their taxes to see if I can get a copy, I also plan to contact the IRS.
 3) Social Security doesn't have them listed as each other's spouses even though they did provide me with a form that said my dad would translate for his wife, which is my mom (WHAT THE FUCK)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, going to ho chi Minh this summer (12june) for an internship (4weeks) & for two weeks of travel up north.
 They've said I can do my internship whenever I want, so I can decide when I travel. I don't know if it's best to travel in June 12-30 and then do my internship, or in July (after my internship)..or if there will be any difference at all 
 was hoping I'd be able to hike in sa pa and phong nha. I know it's rainy season,, but I am not sure if this means absolutely no hiking or nature ever, or if it'll just vary day by day ?
 :) I'm excited to live in HCMC
 I'm super keen to spend some time in jungles too--i wanted to do this tour, https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-ba-deep-jungle-expedition/ but it's 2 grand ... Any tips ? If I find a tent and someone cool to come with me, ? 
 Would really appreciate Any advice/comments you have, and if you have any special places to recommend id be very very grateful :)
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something about malls/supermarkets in Vietnam that makes me feel like it's more interesting and luxurious. In the US they just feel mainstream and "I go there just to buy stuff" kind of feeling. In Vietnam going to a supermarket is like being on a fun trip. For example a trip to Coop Mart was a lot more fascinating than walking around in Walmart. Maybe because I was young and poor so memories were more fond?
 ** Ok so I'm probably wrong about the malls. But what about the supermarkets? Is it fair to compare Walmart, Target and Costco to Coop Mart and Lotte Mart?

 I’ve seen sellers on the sides of the road in areas like D12, Đào Tiên, and a few others spots but they’re hit or miss on what they have or if the trees are real, so I want to see if anyone here knows where to snag a good deal on a bonsai tree.

I have alos heard people not getting a response from the office that is responsible for drone permits. I have a DJI mini drone and am wondering where I can apply for a permit (at least try to) and if I should be worried about getting my drone confiscated. I know there are other posts about this but i haven't got a definitive answer yet. Thanks for any help.
 Edit 1: I should also add that I do not plan to fly in, or close to any city, police or goverment building.

Listening to the audio, while writing down everything really helps for my learning and it's well paced. I recommend pimsleur for any viet kieus that never got around to learning vietnamese.

Where I’m from there’s lots of people who are also of Vietnamese descent, but I’ve noticed that around 20-40% of these people are also mixed with Chinese. Is it the same in Vietnam? I know that China and Vietnam use to be on bad terms (might still be?) yet VietChinese people are so prevalent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 22 (from Canada) and have been to vietnam 4 times in my life and 3 of those times was during the summer months because of school and once last November because I was done school.
 2024 Tết there could be a chance I'm free to head back to Vietnam in February to celebrate tet with my family (currently waiting to see if i'm accepted into my masters program that starts this upcoming september)..
 Curious what the experience is like in Vietnam during Tết? To me it probably would be something cool and new since I never got to see it before.. but to my family over there they probably experienced it too many times already.
 Every Vietnam trip I stay in Hue and HCM city,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When in Thailand I got full body massages once a week. No happy endings, and never had it on my list of things to try. I just wanted to relax my muscles from full days of walking, and only went to places that had signs saying "no sex".
 Landed in Hanoi a few days ago and went for a full body Vietnamese massage at a parlor where the women were dressed up in everyday clothing. So I thought this massage was gonna be like in Thailand, and solely for muscle relaxation and recovery from walking.
 I turn on my back and massage was good, then all of a sudden I start to notice the lady spending a lot of time in my groin region. I thought i may have felt really tight there, so maybe she was working out some knots..
 I was wrong, I was getting aroused, and she knew as well. Then tells me she'll give me a good massage and motions for a "special" type of massage..
 There was NO intentions of me getting one, and I thought I was just getting a regular massage as I always have in Thailand.
 Anyone else have this happen?? It was pretty funny looking back at it, and still no "special massages" since being in Asia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Viet boyfriend and I (South Korean girl) have dated for a year. We’re at the same age (2000 kids). We studied abroad at the same uni in Canada. Last year, my parents came to Canada to attend my convocation. I introduced him to my parents, and they're really impressed with him bc of his family background, handsome face, height, education and graduation job (these things are very important in Korean culture), 
 Next month, he and I will travel to Vietnam for summer vacation and visit his parents in Hanoi. I wanna make them impressed just like he did on my mom and dad. 
 What can I do to impress his parents?Especially when I come to his family house, and we do not speak the same language. 
 Do old Viet people judge girls by their look, family background like Korean do? I’m quite confident but I don’t look like Viet girls.
 My Viet female friend say Hanoi parents are extremely conservative. Is that true?
 What gifts should I give to them? I have some high-end korean skincare products for his mom, but have no idea for his dad.
 Update: thank you guys for great suggestions. As I know from my Viet female friend, his parents are well off and live in a big mansion in Hanoi. That could mean they’re open minded like you guys commented. I’m confident in answering all questions regarding family background, I know rich Asian people care about these things. My dad also asked him about his dad’s job when we had dinner in Toronto. My boy has a brother who has a wife working as IELTS teacher. Both of them can speak English, so luckily I have more people to talk without translation and support me. So excited to come to 🇻🇳🇻🇳 for the first time

I am fine with fish, lobster, crab, and shrimp. I'm not deathly allergic - I just get a gastrointestinal reaction but that would ruin a day or two of the trip! What is the best way to make sure my food will not have mollusks in it? I'd like to have some seafood. What things should I avoid and what should I say to someone to ask if the dish has mollusks in it? Thank you

 so as advice to all traveling to hcm airport, only book taxi from companies and issues receipt, but now a days vinasun and malinh counters or liason taxi handlers started to behave more like gangsters, that's why i started using taxi companies before the exit, looks like im running out of options, except to book grab or gojek

A few folks I met along the way had warned me about Hanoi. I had bought some donuts for 50k. I did not have any small change so I gave her 500k and asked for 450k back. She pretend to gave me an extra donut and move away so I asked for my change. She brought out her purse and said this was what I gave her (50k). I had to wait for another order from another vendor and by the time I went back to her, she had already disappeared! Just be careful and use small changes especially with street vendors!

 Planning a trip with some friends in June from Australia. Will be mostly staying in Saigon with a stop at Dalat and then Nha Trang then back to saigon.
 We decided to opt in for the sleeper bus route but just wondering if these are best to be booked in vietnam themselves or can be done from a reputable online website. Any thoughts?

 Why is this so complicated? Can someone tell me the best way to get some spending cash in Vietnam? Good ATMs to go to that won't rip you off too much?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been traveling in Vietnam for a a little over a week and was in Thailand for a month before that.
 This past week I started getting diarrhea. Not in the ill, going multiple times a day way. But every morning I wake up a bit earlier than usual with the urge to go. And my stool is like water.
 Normal appetite, no cramps, no nausea, nothing. I’m vegetarian, so haven’t eaten any weird meats.
 The first night it started was after I did a caving tour. We used our guide’s water filter straw but that was it. Also, seems a bit fast for it to be related to that? Either way, I don’t know. Just a thought. 
 Otherwise I feel fine! Great energy. It’s just that my usual daily bowel movement is watery diarrhea.
 Suggestions?

 Was just wondering which note is best to have as in it won't be too large for street vendors to provide change but not too small to give multiple notes to restaurants etc? The zeros are a bit daunting
 Also what are typical costs of things over there eg grocery, street food, etc ?

 There is only one option I know is using PayPal but the fee it charges me really expensive.
 For those having some experiences, can you share with me the way how to deal with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After my previous post here- https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/13lhuw3/pros_and_cons_of_trying_dog_meat_in_vietnam/ I've decided to try dog and cat as well during my trip to Vietnam.
 I grew up on a farm in the midwest of the US, and I love animals. I actually think cows and pigs are just as smart and loving, if not more, than dogs, so I realized that I don't really have an issue eating dogs due to abuse because cows/pigs in the US are brutalized far more than dogs in vietnam (look up factory farming practices in the US if you don't believe me, it is truly an abomination).
 However, I'd like to "kill two birds with one stone", if you will. Can anyone recommend me a high quality restaurant (don't want to eat some street dog/cat or something) that serves both dog and cat? I would like to try both, but I don't want to go to two separate establishments to try.

 However, on Voz, I've seen some Vietnamese incorporate history into their viewpoint. Some people believe that modern Japanese people are "disgusting" because they are descended from bad people.
 I'm curious if any of the Vietnamese people here have similar thoughts. For example, should we be cautious around a Japanese person simply because they are Japanese?
 I don't ask this question just because. I'm about to start working for a Japanese company in Vietnam, and I don't want anything like this to get in my way.

 The VinFast Fadil, after some initial research, seems like a solid option. It's both cheaper in VN and seemingly has more features than the competitors like the Toyota Wigo, Honda Brio, or Chevrolet Spark...
 However, I haven't been able to find any decent English reviews of the car online. Can anyone who has owned one share their experiences? Are they a reliable car? Worth the 380 million or so to purchase one?

 Does anyone have any suggestions for some not-for-profit organisations that might benefit from our tourism / donations / contributions? 
 For example, when I visited Bolivia some years ago I joined a not-for-profit tour group that took us on hikes to see the mountains, and the money we spent was used to benefit the local communities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone I’m a long time lurker but can’t find any proper advice on this. My partner and I are staying in Ninh Binh want to rent a motorbike to see Tam Coc while we’re here as I feel it would be a waste not to. We’re just super nervous about renting a motorbike/scooter. I’m used to mopeds a little and we rented one earlier in our trip on Langkawi in Malaysia. But Vietnam traffic is something else lol, I feel confident enough to do it but wondering what other people’s experiences driving Ninh Binh to Tam Coc is? Outside the town how safe are the roads? Thank u in advance and if there’s anything we should see while I’m Tam Coc any recommendations would be welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite growing up in the midwest of America, I am a VERY adventurous eater and have traveled to a few exotic places, always trying the local foods.
 There are a few things I will stay away from, mostly bugs/spiders/roaches, etc, but I've eaten crickets and scorpions.
 I am a bit torn because I researched that you can find dog in Vietnam and that it's actually pretty common. I'm debating on whether or not I should try it. Is it safe to eat? Like are these dogs bred to be eaten or are they diseased street animals that are caught and cooked?
 By the way, while I love dogs, I find it somewhat hypocritical that people will turn a blind eye to the atrocious factory farming practices deployed on cows and pigs, while judging the shit out of people who eat dog. As someone who grew up on a farm, I can tell you that both cows and pigs are just as intelligent, if not more, than most dogs. Cows will actually get to know you and love you, just like a dog, so please let's not judge people who eat dogs when America brutalizes and tortures cows.

 My girlfriend is aVietnamese citizen in the US on a student Visa. 
 On a trip home from Vietnam today she lost her passport during a connecting flight. 
 Is there some way she can get a new passport in the US? She lives in Chicago so there are no embassies or consulates nearby. 
 If anyone has experienced this and can help it would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m from the US and my mom is from Long Xuyen. It’s been a dream of mine to see where she grew up. My honeymoon is in January, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to go to Vietnam especially with good weather conditions during that time of year. However, I haven’t traveled internationally in over a decade so I’m nervous for the language barrier and ideally I’d want to visit multiple cities but this seems complicated in Vietnam. I also want to see Da Nang’s beach. Is seeing Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City, and Long Xuyen possible in a two week trip? I’ve been told by people to “hire a driver” but Ho Chi Minh and Long Xuyen are 3 hours apart, so I’m not sure if this is doable. I was thinking of flying of Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh, but I’m not sure how that would be either. Any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated!

I always pronounced it at “knee” until one day she told me that’s technically not how it’s pronounced and it’s typically hard for English speakers to get the proper pronunciation. I don’t see her often but she’s visiting me this summer and I would love to be able to say her name properly. If there’s a video or audio clip of someone saying the name that would be even better.

Started off as a commuting purpose but soon turned into a hobby/addiction cause of how fun I can get on these pevs especially freely going around the city.
 Id love to take my EUC back to Vietnam but arent too sure about the laws and regulation behind these things, id assume they would be on the same level as those electric moped that the high school kids used to ride on but i can be wrong. Tried doing some research on it but not a lot of results came up. I know these arent technically legal but are they like super restricted or is it like "you are technically not supposed to ride them but I dont care enough" kinda thing. Would love to hear what you have in mind.
 Thanks!

 I'm trying to research things about the country, including what to do and what NOT to do, but I was wondering if anyone could throw a few tips my way, mostly to help me avoid getting scammed.
 I have travelled to a few asian countries- Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and China (Major cities only). Is Vietnam/Hanoi similar to any of those places?
 I guess my questions would be (sorry for the ignorance, usually I research a place I go to for weeks, but I don't really have time for this trip.
 1) Is street food safe to eat? Water at restaurants? Do you ask for "no ice" due to bacteria issues?
 2) What is the best way to get around? Uber? Taxi? etc
 3) Any recommendations on what to do?
 4) Shopping tips? I would like to buy some knives and sandals and cool collectables. I hear knives are very cheap and well made in Vietnam.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 My question is about obtaining my background check for Vietnam. When selecting the purpose of the check, am I supposed to select “for personal review” or “living abroad/visa requirement”? I’m using accurate biometrics, and the only advice I could find is for Korea, which may have different requirements than Vietnam. 
 I have seen that when teaching in Korea, they tell you to select personal review. However that leaves a notice on the paper that states “not valid for use abroad” or something along these terms. However the hagwons seem to accept it anyway, and I’m not sure if that’s the same as Vietnam. 
 Has anyone here used Accurate Biometrics before, and which option did you select before submitting your request? 
 In the second to last drop down box on the demographics page, did you select for personal review, or the “visa requirement/living abroad” option? I want to make sure I check the correct box during the process to ensure I get the proper results needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So yesterday i met a couple of guys from my country and we drank beer and had a good time on the party street. Next thing i know is that im sitting on a random guys scooter on the way to his apartment, i dont remember his face, i dont remember him taking my phone at all. What i remember is just being very upset about losing my phone but still remained relatively calm. In a proper manner, i asked a guy in a green uniform who was nearby when it happend (i think) and it just felt like he was part of it all. 
 The guy has withdrawn more than $600 (the card was in the phonecase", do you think its possible to get this back because i am already on a tight budget... Maybe need to make police report for that and im probably leaving tomorrow. Whats even more scary is how he knew my pin-code. Something that sucks too is that all my pictures are gone. This was a big shit storm and it has completely ruined my mood and now i probably cant continue traveling as long as I planed.
 Has anyone been in this situation before? I would gladly take all tips from you guys.

 Day 1: Arrive in Da Nang + head to Hoi An 
 Day 2: Explore Hoi An 
 Day 3: Hoi An + head to Da Nang at night/ sleep 
 Day 4: Morning flight from Da Nang > Hanoi + explore Hanoi
 Day 5: Day trip to Halong Bay 
 Day 6: Explore Hanoi 
 Day 7: Explore Hanoi + fly back 
 I omitted Hue just because of the distance from Da Nang & really want to see the lanterns + tailor shops in Hoi An, but I am also wondering if this schedule is too packed. In between squeezing in two regions of Vietnam vs staying in Hanoi the entire trip (and maybe adding in additional day trips) / saving Hoi An + Hue for a later time, which would you all suggest? 
 Thank you :)

 My 2 friends and I are headed to Vietnam from October 9th to 18th. We are wanting to spend 2 nights out of the city hiking or at a beach town. We would prefer that the drive from the city to 2 night stay location is about 3 hours or so. Then, 3 days in the city indulging in food/drinks, day activities, etc. 
  
Should we go to Hanoi or HCMC?
 I did a little research and saw that it was a bit colder and slightly rainy. Kind of like winter. I'm curious about what locals say the weather is like there during the middle of October.
 For Hanoi and HCMC what are the best hikes/towns/beach areas to spend 2 nights at?
  
Any other recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 hello everyone! this is my first post here, but I’d really like to get some feedback on this as i just had this idea pop into my head this morning. 
 so my fiancé is vietnamese and he’s back in vietnam visiting family after having moved away about 13 years ago. he’s from saigon. 
 i’ve been trying to get him to teach me vietnamese but he hasn’t been very good at it 🤣 i’m very familiar with self studying languages as i’ve been studying mandarin for about 12 years now, so i’m more than willing to get a few resources to learn on my own and just ask him questions when i have any. 
 any and all recommendations would be greatly appreciated! specific book/show/movie/etc recommendations preferred since my fiancé doesn’t really know what to look for since he’s not familiar with modern learning resources available in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on vacation in Vietnam right now and a pretty big plant enthusiast. There are many different kind of banana plants and I especially like the one being grown here in Vietnam so I'd really like to take one home. I can't get one like this in my home country so this is the only way. From what I know I have to carry a phytosanitary certificate for this. Now, I have a couple of questions:
 1.) what exactly is a banana plant called in vietnamese and in what kind of shop can I buy one? Most garden shops don't sell those. They grow everywhere but I can't just steal one, right?
 2.) for phytosanitary certificate I found this site. I'm at a hotel in Hanoi so I could just drive there. My main concerns are: Are 7 days enough time? Do I need a real adress in Vietnam? What would it cost?
 Thank you in advance <3

 I was planning to rent a motorbike and head up to the sand dunes. I intend to hire a quad bike or something when I'm there. 
 But I've seen this notice in my hotel. Is this true, should I be concerned? Or do you think this is the hotel trying to sell tours?
 I have a license to ride a motorcycle and have the right international license for Vietnam. Is this still illegal?
 Thanks. Any help is greatly appreciated.

They're convinced that the Hue house is worth over $500k and the other house is worth nearly $200k USD. I'm not so convinced they're worth that much but then again I lived in the U.S my whole life, so I honestly wouldn't know. So my question is how much is a large 5 bedroom house with a store front on the lower level worth?

 Does anyone has experience with ILA and VUS I would definitely appreciate any previous experiences as my current advisor for the job is not responding back at all, and none of my colleagues can reach her either to further process me. I’m thinking I will go on their website and reapply, also apply to VUS. Any advice and experience stories is much appreciated.
 I really would like to know about the work cultures, salary differences (I’ve seen other posts and I believe they’re around the same) and how reliable both are in terms of getting people processed effectively without issues.

 Went outside for a cigarette before booking a taxi to the local bus station, when a young local nearby comes over and asks if I want a taxi. He tells me hes a grab driver and flashes his phone at me with the app up. Normally I'd make my excuses and leave but it had been a long day travelling and I had a sleeper bus to catch to Ha Giang. 
 He beckons me to follow him and we walk past the taxi ranks to the car park. I assumed he was just parked up having a ciggy so dont think much of it. Theres a car half pulled into a bay that he walks upto and knocks on the window. Weird but I thought maybe hes passing the job onto his friend.

 For starters, I’m in my mid-twenties, been an aviation “engineer” for a couple years and absolutely despise every single aspect of it besides the pay.

We were staying near Binh Thanh market and there were a bunch of jewellery shops there. Strangely enough, a couple of them, I think those were gold & diamond stores, did not allow us to enter and were very rude. In one such outlet (picture attached), the guard blocked our way, and just kept saying "No". Not sure if they were just prejudiced against us (Indians) or was it something else. Racism is something I have never observed in oriental countries.

I know there’s probably a million other posts like this but I just wanted to bring it home again that Apax Leaders should be avoided altogether unless you enjoy working for free.

Would I be able to save money and live comfortably with this much pay? It seems as though I will need to travel up to 10km throughout the city to different schools, is public transportation reliable enough to get to the schools in a punctual manner.
 I have never been to Vietnam or anywhere in Asia. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, I've noticed that Vietnam's road signs are similar to the road signs in other post-Soviet countries, or Russia. However, does anyone have any more details on this? I mean, this makes less sense than in, for instance, Azerbaijan, which was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, therefore was under Soviet control.
 Did, by any chance, Vietnam simply copy their signs from the Soviets/Russia, taking their obvious friendly relations into account?

I know my theory and can match pitch but struggle singing on my own. I'm looking for an instructor (if you speak English this will be easier, still working on my vietnamese). I can sing a c scale while playing it on guitar and and can fake it in d minor but that's about it. If there are any instructors here I could use the help. I'm not trying to be an amazing singer but I would like to be able to sing backup for a rock/multiple subgenre band. If there are any vocal coaches, I want to improve my skills and am interested in your services. If there are any pros who can help I'm interested in your services. Thank you. If you offer vocal lessons please reach out. I live in Sài Gòn and can use all the help I can get. Message me if you are a teacher. Cảm ơn.

I know there's direct flights to Da Nang from Korea but surely Korea is nice enough to just vacation at home instead? Is Vietnamese cuisine is incredibly popular with Koreans or is it the exchange rate? Are there a lot of Korean companies in Vietnam nowadays (meaning they aren't actually tourists but they live & work here)? Genuinely curious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have this annoying pet peeve when it comes to parking my motorbike, whether it is in front of a restaurant or in some motorbike parking that when I come back I always find my bike: 1) moved somewhere else and mashed between other motorbikes, 2) the dude is sitting on my motorbike and smoking a cigarette, 3) both 1 and 2. I’ve been living here for about 5 years now and it still bothers me til this day. If I frequent a place then I usually build a relationship with the guy and give him a little extra coffee money to leave my bike where it is and to not do the things I stated above so it works out. But, when it’s a new place that I barely go to I usually don’t have that luxury and I become quite annoyed by this experience every time. I have a little bit of OCD and care about the condition of my motorbike and would like to keep it in nice condition. It really bothers me that I spend a lot of time and money to keep it nice just for some guy who doesn’t give a fuck to erase all those efforts in a matter of 10 minutes and scratch it all up. I understand that I don’t deserve special treatment when there are other people besides me, but this standard of service shouldn’t be ok especially when it’s my personal property and I am parking to be a customer at the place. 
 If this sort of thing also bothers you, how do you deal with it? I find that most locals with old and beaten bikes do not care. But what if you have a nice modded bike or even a big bike that costs 150mil + vnd? Any suggestions or tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am returning to Vietnam this year (in a few weeks) and I’d like to find some stuff to do that’s a bit different to the typical tourist activities. I’ve booked two weeks in Ho Chi Minh City (located I. District 1) and will be hiring a motorbike to get around (not opposed to getting on a domestic flight though).
 I spent 1 month travelling around Vietnam last year and had an amazing time, I’ve always been curious around this country and the people and I was not disappointed! 
 I am a contemporary artist and work for a University of Fine Arts in Australia so I am really looking for creative things to partake in. There must be a network of musicians and artists in this wonderful city of millions!? When researching online for things to check out it seems like only the really obvious stuff comes up (I can’t help but wonder if it’s because I’m searching from within Australia). I want to see exhibitions by local, innovative artists, maybe undertake some workshops in craft traditions and music gigs by exciting Vietnamese bands! Where can I go or what venues offer this? (not interested in night clubs haha). Thanks for any suggestions ✌️🙏👍

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been in Vietnam for a few months now and I have been staying with my grandma in Bình Dương . A week from now I will be moving to Da Nang. I have multiple long term plans of what I am trying to do here in Vietnam, so I will be staying in Da Nang indefinitely. I am looking for a place that I can volunteer in exchange of accommodation, whether it would be teaching kids English, taking care of the elderly, or tending to the victims of agent orange, v.v...
 Doing this will give me a chance to integrate and connect with the locals easier. This is what I did when I first moved to Thailand and also in Portugal. In the meantime during my volunteering, I would be exploring, trying to get familiar with the area and also attempting to find my own place. Will be truly grateful for anyone who has experience in volunteering in Da Nang and be willing to share and help me out with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody !
 I'm from France and I visited Vietnam in october 2018. I loved your country so much, it must have been the best travel of my life. After that, I got interested in vietnamese culture, the food, the language, the music. I listened to popular vietnamese songs on Youtube. Not the oldschool, historically famous ones. More like the hits of the last few years.
 ​
 I remember listening to one song in particular and I just can't find it anymore. It wasnt the best song or anything, but it bugs me because I can see the video clip in my head and it's frustrating. Here is what I know about it : 
  
The main singer was a man 
 It was released before the end of 2019
 The clip is at night, in a big city. A man and a woman are having fun, getting drunk, playing pool. And there's an underlying love story
 I think he's hoping something happens betweem them 
 I think it was rap. But maybe not 100% rap ? 
  
I know it's not much... But if it rings a bell to anyone, it would make my day and remind me great memories ! Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, it’s been a few of days since I moved to HCMC, I put up in District 4 and was looking to buy some cigarettes. Asked around in the convenience stores and from the little bit we could communicate through google translate, all of them said they don’t sell cigarettes in the area. Will I get some at Circle K in District 1 or just from roadside sellers? (Haven’t gone beyond my area because work ends at dusk, and I did go out the first day after work but got spooked because got approached by different men twice asking where I am from and stuff so not stepping out in the evening anymore)

From our research we saw that Viettel was the best so we walked over to the Viettel stall to the far right of the airport when you get off and bought a SIM card. They put it in my phone and taped my old SIM to the card that came with the new sim like they do in every country when you do this. I had to ask for a sim removal tool (usually it comes with the new sim pack) and the lady dug up a paper clip (This was my first clue something was wrong) and taped that to the card as well.

 I check majority of Fahasa bookstores when I pass them and the occasional stationery shop but I can't seem to find this specific brand. Not available on Shopee, Lazada, etc. either ):
 I would love for any specific shop names if you know any, and any other suggestions as well! Ordering and shipping directly from the website is kinda my last resort.
 Thank you in advance! ((:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So me and my partner were walking in some park in HCMC and a guy appeared from nowhere and started pointing at my partner’s shoe. We didn’t understand what he meant so he came closer and took out a funny brush from his “shoe repair and maintenance box” and started quickly washing my bf’s shoes. We both said “No” about five times and soon there was another guy attacking my shoes. They basically took of our shoes from our feet - pretended to wash them with their super duper chemicals and glued an extra heel on my bf’s Birkenstock sandals (which of course came off after a few days and looks hilarious). After finishing their grand hard work of one minute they asked us 500.000 dongs from each of us (~40 euros in total). It’s not that I didn’t expect for them to ask money, I understood it from the very beginning but they were really good and quick in undressing us.. I gave them 500.000 (shouldn’t have) and they asked for another half. I literally showed them my wallet - I didn’t have that much. It is funny that they didn’t agree to take less than 500.000 - they were insisting on their price and I started finally showing my attitude, saying that we didn’t want their “service” in the first place and that we don’t have more money. So I told them let’s call the police. They didn’t like the idea and their hooligan leader took my bf’s shoe and threw it in the trash bin direction. We quickly vanished afterwards. So, our stupidity is not under a question mark - it was our first day in Vietnam, we were probably jetlagged and awed, and just fools. However, we indeed said “no” many many times and actually the next level would’ve been shouting, which we didn’t even consider and our politeness costed us 500000 dongs. My question is about the police - which side would’ve they taken? I assume this shoe business is illegal and we would’ve been right? But I saw so many people in forms in the city (I assume - policemen) - how come is their business still running?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm planning to travel to Vietnam (29/F) landing in Ho Chi Minh City. I'm well travelled in Europe but it will be my first time in Asia. I will join a tour for most of my stay but was planning on arriving in advance to get over jet lag and relax a bit. Do you have any tips for my safety and to avoid scams? Where should I stay and what transport is best from the airport? I read about some taxi scams? I'd be happy to splurge a bit to be in a nice hotel with a swimming pool where I could meet other travellers perhaps and explore the area in advance of the tour (50-75 euro per night). Also, should I have predominantly cash in the local currency? Any generic advice would be appreciated as I'm getting nervous!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, my partner and I live together with his parents, but we are not married. We also live in a European country. My partner has lived here since birth and his parents came here i think shortly after the war. They are both from northern Vietnam. I have only lived here for 4 years. I refer to them as bố and mẹ since I'm learning Vietnamese, and bố told me that since my partner and I are living together, it is the same as being married in Vietnam, and that it's fine for me to call them bố and mẹ since its normal to call your in-laws mom and dad, and this is also common in the culture that I grew up in. The issue/thing that is confusing me is that while neither have an issue with me calling them that, bố always responds for himself as bố , while mẹ switches between mẹ and cô. I only use simple vietnamese at the moment, but an example would be:I: khi nào bố sẽ đi làm ? B: bố đi làm lúc (time)
 Mẹ would use the same or respond with cô. Is this a regional or cultural thing, or is this because there is no blood relation? I don't think I have heard her use it with my partner or her daughter, but it oculd be that I missed it because I'm still learning the language. I also thought that it might be similar to how bạn, tôi is used as another exception pronoun. Do other non-vietnamese people also refer to their vietnamese in-laws in the same way?
