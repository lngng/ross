        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xin chào! I recently started my journey of learning Vietnamese in the northern dialect. I've seen a few different people say that it's always helpful to consume some sort of media in your target language to familiarize yourself with the sounds and pronunciation, even if you don't understand anything. This of course isn't going to be my primary method of studying but I'm sure it would be a useful tool, especially with English subtitles but that isn't a requirement. Does anyone have suggestions for something I could use that is mainly in the northern accent? I can listen to podcasts/radio shows at work, or it could be content creators or TV shows/movies for in my free time. I would appreciate any ideas! Cảm ơn (:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I just bought a ticket for my mother to fly from Vietnam to the US. I’m staying in the States so this ticket is bought in United Air website, fly with ANA Japan. 
 Here is the issue I have. My mother name Anh Thi Nguyễn which Anh is first name and Nguyễn is her last name. On her passport and Visa, it says Given Name Thi Anh and last name is Nguyễn, so combined is Thi Anh Nguyễn. 
 When I booked, I put last name Nguyễn, first name Anh, middle name Thi, ticket comes out with traveler name is Anh Thi Nguyễn. 
 I found out I cannot change anything. Will this be an issue when she flies with custom? 
 Thank you everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a white guy (Ukranian ancestry and American born) and live in Southern California and I recently rented a room from a Vietnamese family. Very nice people, I've only spoken to them briefly but they seem really nice and it's a great room and beautiful, quiet house!
 The wife of the family has been hard with me though...they were renting a room to somebody before that was there for 6 years, and I'm "the new renter" and she has been getting on my case for stuff that's pretty obviously just to give me a hard time and probably to test me a bit and see how I'll react perhaps? I'm not sure. She keeps telling me that if she doesn't like me that she'll just tell her husband and that they won't let me live there. 
 The husband has been very laid back for the most part, it seems like she is just testing me somewhat and wants to make sure I'm a nice person and a good renter. 
 Anyway, I wanted to ask is there some kind of gift I can get for her or the family that would show my appreciation to the family for renting the room? I'm fairly new to SoCal which has a large Vietnamese population as I'm sure you know, and I'd like to get the something as a housewarming gift and to show my appreciation.
 Thanks in advance, much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During our stay in Vietnam, when we were asked where we come from, we noticed some curious pattern:
 -Greece
 -[questioning look]
 -Hy Lap
 -Aaaah, Hy Lap. Pyramids!
 -No, that is Egypt. We are the others, the ones with the columns. XD
 So, most usually people confused Greece with Egypt. It’s not insulting for us or anything like that but I really wonder why that mix-up was so common. I understand that an obscure, small, rather insignificant country in the other end of the world can be mixed up with other, neighboring countries. But why specifically with Egypt?
 My suspicion is that most Vietnamese have heard of Greece in history class at school. Maybe in chapter "ancient civilizations of eastern Mediterranean"? (That’s when Greece was thriving)
 Please help me untangle this mystery.

The weather is due to be wet, but it doesn't deter me. I will travel from Saigon to Hanoi from September 10-31st and am truly excited. I have plenty of places I'd like to visit in the middle/north such as Hue, Hoi An, Sapa and Phong Nha. However, I lack destinations in the south that may be worth visiting this time of year, apart from Saigon and Dalat. I have searched for places to visit, but am concerned that they won't be too enjoyable in wet weather. Is there anywhere in the south people found particularly beautiful in September? Many thanks in advance👍

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[just a bit confused about what's socially acceptable for couples in public. i've been under the impression that pda is very frowned upon, i've heard even just hugging or holding hands isn't great. i've seen many couples that wrap their arms around each other on motos so i figured that was normal, even if they aren't holding on for support or safety so much as just a desire. but what about the girls i've seen koala-ing (had both arms and legs wrapped around the guy) their bfs on motos? is that fine? have i been wrong about what slides and what doesn't?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am at work today so I gave my family my cards in case they need to buy anything (they come to visit me). I put £1000 on the card. For all days I kept receiving notifications with money caming out from my card. And when contacted them, they informed me that they were buying perfumes, cosmetics and wines.
 The annoying part is that they didn't even spend the money for themselves. They spent it to buy souvenirs for people I don’t even know and they didn't even meet once every couple of months. My sister bought gifts for her mother-in-law’s neighbours, my niece bought gifts for her classmates. I already bought lots of cosmetics and functional foods for my sisters and cousins at home so there isn't much they need to buy. I already covered the expenses of the whole trip, so with this It feels like I am even paying for people who didn't even do anything for my life.
 The culture of buying gifts for everyone when travelling is something I couldn't understand. They didn't even contribute one penny when we work our ashes out to afford holiday. Why do we have to buy them gifts when we enjoy the sweet fruit of our labour?

 The only drawback I could think of is the inconveniences and it being impractical? But I feel like the office uniform of white shirt tucked in is not exactly comfortable either, the tucked-in could easily be ruined if you move around too much too

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, as the title suggests. A bit about myself: I'm a female located in HCMC and currently working as a Data Analyst. I have a knack for drawing and I'm working as a freelance 3D artist.
 The game titles I often play:
  
League of Legends (Mostly in Aram mode, I've reached Grandmaster rank as an ADC)
 Valorant
 Honkai Star Rail
 Genshin Impact
 I can play various games on Steam that support co-op mode.
 I'm fond of narrative-driven games like Cyberpunk 2077, Batman Trilogy, Final Fantasy...
  
I use Discord and I prefer playing games at home.
 I hope to find someone who would like to play with me after stressful working hours. 
 I am indeed a real girl. I'm not transgender or anything like that. It's just that my gaming hobby and skills aren't common in my job and profession. I'm also pursuing a master's degree, so I don't have time to find gaming buddies. I've spent a lot of money to hire gaming partners, but I've realized that those relationships can be quite toxic.

 I have come to understand that Vietnam has very strict laws against the usage of marijuana, but that these laws are rarely enforced. I am a foreigner - an American, and the situation is much the same in many parts of the country here. In addition to this, there has been a fairly constant push amongst some people to legalize marijuana here, and it seems likely to me that it will be made federally legal some time in the relatively near future (though I don't think the country is quite there yet). I was curious if it is the same for Vietnam - what is the general sentiment on marijuana laws? Do you believe marijuana should be legal in Vietnam, and do you think it will be soon, or do you think the current laws will remain in place for the foreseeable future, and why?

It's been 2 days since then, no further notice. Idk if it's been rejected or been through customs clearance. Who and what should I contact for my package. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a foodie and would love to eat at Saigon’s only Michelin starred restaurant on my next trip. However, the Google reviews are rather lackluster. What are the VN foodies thoughts on this place? Normally $80-$125 tasting menu pricing isn’t that big of a deal in the west, but I feel I can better spend that money elsewhere. I had the million Dong pho from LM81 and thought it was a solid 7/10, but wouldn’t go out of my way to eat there again. 
 Also, how far in advance do I need to make reservations? Thank you.

 I am planning my trip to vietnam next month. I will go with one of my friend which is VN. We will stay in his village (Đức thắng mộ Đức quảng Ngãi)for one week at his parents house.
 Problem is: he told me that in the past the military have forbidden foreingers to stay and sleep the night in this village. Apparently for 'security' reason because of some military zone nearby. We would have to book hotel nearby and visit his family during the day. Problem is that I do not find any official information on this interdiction and what are the exact restrictions. I would like to know the laws/rules so that I am not putting myself into problems.
 Questions: Are you aware of any official restrictions for foreigners in certain part of vietnam? Any forbiden place or activity related to military area?

 I am very excited to be going to Vietnam for the first time on October 5th of this year. I am meeting my best friend who's been living in Germany for the last 8 months. It's going to be a fairly quick trip, and neither of us knows the best way to go about it.
 As it stands, we are meeting in HCM and we have a total of 16 days before I need to fly back from HCM to Australia on the 21st. Currently, we're thinking of spending 8 days in HCM and then another 8 days in Hanoi, as Google says Hoi An will have bad weather. I wouldn't mind going to Sapa as that looks good too, but I'm at a complete loss as to what to do and where to go.
 I have some general concerns as this will be my first time overseas from Australia and im not too sure what to expect. 
 with that out the way the only solid plans I have are landing in HCM on the 5th of Oct and flying out on the night of the 21st. Any advice would be appreciated. Also, I just want to make sure I don't make any rookie travel mistakes during that time. I know there are massive differences in weather across the country during that period and Im mostly just looking to find the driest / sunniest place to go that time of year. Apologies in advance im just a bit confused as every website I see gives different advice and wildly different weather predictions. 
 Thanks!

When I visited Vietnam a month ago, I thought people were mostly friendly, ( although a Belgian traveler I met said that he was denied entry to restaurants on a couple of occasions ) and the country was far more beautiful ( nature ) than I expected. Mostly the countryside in Ninh Binh. How many of you live in the countryside in Vietnam ? Do you enjoy it or does or get boring quick enough ?

I’m very introverted person and need time alone. Is this level of communication typical in Vietnamese relationships? He is very keen on me committing to the relationship even though I just met him. I don’t know if I’m comfortable with this style of relationship. He has respected my boundaries but I do feel overwhelmed and unsure about my feelings for him.

 I'm aware I would need to do a border run every 1/3 months depending on how the visa situation develops. Living somewhat frugally, eating what the locals do, but still having pretty regular nights out on the town.
 Roughly how long do you think I should plan to stay there? Thank
 Edit: I definitely meant to put 500 million, sorry about that folks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an (obvious) "western" tourist here, I often have the feeling you cannot walk more than 50 meters without someone approaching you who is after your money (especially in cities). In principle that's fine, it's natural that a lot of people earn money from tourists and have to approach them, so I do not mind. However this leads to me getting used to say "no" to basically everyone taking to me. 
 Today I was walking to the post office (~20 min away) in HCMC with postcards in my hand, and someone driving by (regular guy, no grab jacket or anything) stopped and asked if I was looking for the post office and if he could help me. Out of habit I immediately told him no thanks, but afterwards reflected if I was being mean to someone genuinely wanting to help.
 Similar situations happened several times... So my question: am I being naive, is anyone offering help expecting a tip/money anyways? ( I was also asked for money straight away after someone helped me with a minor think taking 20 second, with rather ungrateful response after I gave only 20k.) Or am I being mean to people and assume they are just after money if they are genuinely nice? And how can you tell the difference?
 My common sense from "back home" does not really seem to apply here, hence my questions.

 Do you guys have any tips? Is it legal? Who should I contact?

 Apparently there are groups on Facebook where Vietnamese women either shame men they are not happy with or use it to warn other women off a man they are interested in.
 Can anyone verify this? Also, I am assuming that they are private groups that guys can’t Peruse

There’s always tons of food so I don’t think I should bring food. There’s always tons of beer so I don’t think I need to bring that either. Last time I brought some flowers. I keep worrying I might accidentally offend them but they keep inviting me so I don’t think I have. We live in America. I’m trying to learn a little Vietnamese but it’s really difficult—will they think it’s weird if I try to say something in Vietnamese? Edit: I’m getting the impression that more beer is alway welcome!
 Edit 2: definitely bringing Hennessy and fruit. Probably not bull penis that someone suggested.

I have been looking for hotel options not too far from the old quarter who either have private parking for guests. All the hotels that I have checked out on Agoda that has car park listed as a facility, don't really have a parking lot in front when I cross checked them on Google Maps. A bit confused right now on how I should go about searching a hotel that meets this criteria, or alternatively should I be looking at paid parking lots and if those are common in Hanoi. 
 Any suggestion/recommendation is highly appreciated.

And last was drinking water before or after eating mangos. I tried looking for online for explanation, but don't find much other than the mango one being a myth

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me, it's the best beach I've ever had the chance to visit. But I've only visited Ha Long Bay and Sam Son Beach, and Sam Son has not exactly ever been recommended by anyone, so I think my opinion might be skewed 
 I love visiting Ha Long bay. I, in fact, has been doing it all the times, alone. I'm afraid it's just sentimental reasons though, It's just that have treasurable memory there. It was a very difficult time of my life, and someone invited me to go there with them. I remember just lying on the golden sand, gazing my eyes up on the blue blue sky, immerse myself into what felt like just emptyless. A big, blue sky and a boderless sea, just made you felt wanting to melting into them, merging with them, disappear into just some bubbles with them. Just plain peace and tranquillity, some tranquillity I deeply needed that time. It calmed me down, calmed my every torments down.
 From then, I always make chances to go there, just to lie on the golden sand again. I only chose when there would be least tourists, even if that means during a storm season. Storm, brings in another kind of tranquillity. 
 But I'm afraid I might be biased. I always tell people that in Vietnam, I love Ha Long the most. I'm afraid the reason I love Ha Long is not for the fact it's actually great there. To gaze into the endless sky, any beach would do.

 Is there a noticeable difference in weather between the north/central/south regions?

 Is there certain clubs(not partying/drinking clubs) I can join to meet new people? Or online groups or apps to use/download? How does the Vietnamese-American Center in Saigon work? I’d love to visit.
 Thanks in advance 🙏

 Also, there will be a layover flight when leaving Vietnam to Taiwan before going back to the states. Will I get any problems at the Taipei airport?
 Would love to hear any experience of traveling back to US with medicine. Thank you all in advance!🫶

The weird thing is whenever my husband takes the dog out for a walk, people ask him if the dog was rescued, especially when the question is directly from the locals. There was also one time the vet in district 2, saigon asked us if we rescued our dog. What are your thoughts on this? Maybe I am missing something or having a viet dog is considered as a rescue act for foreigners here in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this could be a controversial topic, but I really need to get this out there so we can hear each other's opinion.
 I have had a motorbike driving license for 8 years. My bike is reaching 30,000 km traveled intra-city. I've got used to the bustling metropolitan lifestyle.
 But I cannot trust my life on the bike. I've realized my body is out on the open, and each day it's like large cars are out there to get me. During rush hour, the sidewalk is the road. I cannot help but feel guilty for pedestrians who should have the right to the sidewalk, but again, my right of way is being violated by the cars too. City traffic IS deadly if you're a biker, I cannot say otherwise.
 Why allowing such a risky vehicle to become the nation's top chosen transport? Why putting next to none effort in enforcing helmet safety? Why aborting the trolleycars, a totally cool public transport?
 I really need to hear your thoughts.
 Disclaimer: I am not a foreigner. I've lived all my life in Vietnam and married to a third generation Hanoian family, whose members are exclusively chauffered or taking public transport, and advise me to stay out of traffic.

 As u all know, Trump and co-conspirator's mugshots were finally released yesterday and i read a report by vnexpress on this and the comment section is absolutely filled with fanatic Trump supporters, which is kinda strange and disturbing to me since i expect an isolationist president like Trump will not gather as much support in foreign countries, not to mention all of the horrible deeds he had done during and after his presidency( covid response and Jan 6th, etc)
 So just how popular is Trump in this country? Are those comments just trolls or actual opinions of actual Vietnameses?

 Common solution is to find the teacher and give him a chair on the head, but after the anger subsided I think maybe there could be more civilized way to solve this?
 Plan to take him to the hospital for checkups first thing tomorrow, but anyone has suggestions on what we should do? Google only give vague advices that doesn’t help much.

 These toilets tend to have bad water pressure, so I got to thinking while stinking.
 Am I supposed to: 1. Spray and toss the hopefully dookie-less paper into the bin? 2. Not throw PAPER TOWEL into the toilet, but TP is fair play?
 This has been bothering me for years. 
 This is much more ambiguous than "don't stand on the toilet seat" and "don't spray water into the power outlets"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am a person who loves Vietnam very much and has traveled here many times. My favorite destination is the sea in Vietnam, and I have discovered many beautiful beaches suitable for relaxation. Here are the top beautiful beaches in Vietnam that I would recommend:
 1. Lang Co Beach, Hue
 https://preview.redd.it/pwikjgdh37kb1.jpg?width=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1c23e31562a1a517529d1b6210d53dd76dd40f5
 This is my favorite beach. Lang Co Beach is very clean and beautiful, as well as having a wild beauty. I am a person who does not like beaches that are too crowded with tourists and are interfered with by travel companies or resorts, so this is an ideal place for those who love natural beauty.
 2. My Khe Beach, Da Nang
 https://preview.redd.it/inksi4zs47kb1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d44aeb8b8290eecbb18e5bd35d44ad093bd842e5
 Although it is pretty crowded with tourists, the scenery is still beautiful, and there are many exciting activities on the sea that you can participate in, such as playing volleyball, surfing, or. I highly recommend the Paragliding service Paragliding in Da Nang. Should join once in a lifetime to admire the city scenery and enjoy the beauty of Da Nang from above.
 3. Mui Ne Beach
 https://preview.redd.it/2tzaoes737kb1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b9b48b16c9be0969a10ce85e79b64b51503ee36
 Mui Ne is suitable for resort tourism, with luxurious 5-star resorts along the coast. Mui Ne Beach will give you a feeling of peace, not hustle.
 There are also many beautiful beaches in Vietnam that you can refer to in the Top 10 beautiful beaches in Vietnam. I rate the shores of Vietnam as very beautiful, and next time I will evaluate some coastal resorts for those who intend to go to the beach for reference.

 I'll be visiting HCMC and Hanoi in October, and have a few questions that I'm hoping someone here can help me with. 
  
Do any of the teams have HQs or retails shops that I could visit, similar to T1's setup in Seoul? Ideally Hanoi, as I'm only in HCMC for 2 days. 
 
If not team retail shops, any idea where I can buy some team kit from other retail shops? I really like the GAM shirts, but happy to support any/all teams. 
 
Any idea if there will be Worlds 2023 viewing parties in Hanoi? English-speaking?
 
 Thank you in advance

 I am half Vietnamese (born and raised in US) and am trying to get in touch with my Vietnamese side.
 My mother fled from the war when she was very young, so a lot of our family’s traditions and cultures have been lost on my side. 
 A lot of my female family wears jade wrist bangles and other jade jewelry. I was wondering if there is something similar to this permanent jewelry that men wear? I love the idea of wearing a jade bangle, but from my understanding it is something meant for women rather than me. I was unable to find information about this topic from Google, so I am asking here. 
 Thanks!

 Does anyone have a solution? Would even consider by sea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm really feeling exhausted with ESL, I've been doing it for 10 years and would merely label my talent as 'capable'. I don't particularly wish to pursue a management position. I'm in a 4 year relationship and I can't bring myself to commit simply because I don't want to do this job for the rest of my life. I make about 10 bucks more an hour than when I first started which doesn't even make up for inflation.
 I'm willing to learn a new skill and study but I just don't know what other career paths are available to expats here. For the most part, I realise that many non specialist occupations can be filled by a native who will work cheaper than I will. My observation is also that a lot of Western businesses shut down after a year leading me to think that the govt doesn't make foreign business ownership easy.
 My question is what do I need to do to qualify myself for a job which will pay me enough to stay here? What industries can I be considering if I were to reskill?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not a Buddhist practitioner. I don’t go to temple. That being said I would like to start a discussion about monks from an observational pov. I frequent vegetarian places from bình dân food to restaurants like Bà Xã and I would frequently see monks. Nothing that sounds out of the ordinary, right? Most of the time I’ll see monks that would dine in pairs, usually eating in silence. Then there are groups of normies who accompany the monks, and sometimes one man or one woman with a monk. And this is a one time occurrence that I’ve had a friend tell me, he saw a ‘monk’ bring into a vegetarian restaurant his ‘ghệ’ and sneak in beer. He and his lover were kicked out of the establishment.
 So….. I guess I’m curious of a few things. Is it important for some people to want to build a rapport with monks? Is treating them to dinner a part of gaining good merit or something? And just how many monks out there are genuine, fraudulent, or in between with questionable morals?

I met Vietnamese in Vietnam and in North America that prefer it when the collarbone is exposed. Seen guys deem women who were fit, to be too fat. I'm talking about an athletic girl with muscle where fat doesn't seem to be the appropriate adjective to use. Have seen the obsession by women to have pale skin. I really want to know if guys don't like women with curves. The hour glass shape seems to be surpassed by a slender and more modest silhouette. Just curious to know peoples honest and personal opinions along with what they believe to be the national standard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the tourist post, but I tried asking in the stickied post yesterday and didn't get any responses. I have recently decided to come and visit Vietnam for about 10 days and I have a few questions I thought I should ask before I arrive.
 My plan so far is to fly in to HCM for a couple of days, then head up through Hoi An/Da Nang/Hue, before moving on to Hanoi and possibly Ha Long.
 I know I can fly between HCM/Da Nang/Hanoi, but what would be the best way to get between Hoi An/Da Nang/Hue? Also between Hanoi and Ha Long?
 How different are HCM and Hanoi? Are they both worth the same amount of time?
 What is the public transport like in the cities? What is the best way to get around?
 What kind of weather can I expect during September?
 I obviously still want to be able to use my phone for internet while I'm over there. What's a good sim card option for tourists?
 Even though I'm bound to visit some bars during my stay, I'm not much of a drinker anymore. Is there anything else that's good to do at night in these locations that doesn't necessarily involve drinking?
 What should I expect to pay for things like food and drinks?
 What's the best way to see Ha Long?
 Is there any other advice you have for a solo tourist that might not be obvious to foreigners?
 Anyone want to hang out with a random Australian passing through?
 I did have some other questions, but I've forgotten them. Will update as I remember. 
 Thanks for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! So a little background is probably needed for this.
 I am currently living in Denmark as a sort of exchange student and recently went to a local Vietnamese place. I started speaking with the sweet lady who worked there and tried asking different things in Vietnamese. We got to speaking (it’s really funny cause our only common language is Danish, so neither of us were speaking our native tongue once we got past my very broken Vietnamese) and we had a wonderful conversation.
 At one point, after hearing my dogshit Vietnamese, but realizing I love Vietnamese food and people, she did the thing I’ve only ever seen before and invited me to her home. 
 My question is, how do you respond to this? I said thank you of course, but do people ever accept the invite? Refuse? Is it rude to go or not to go? I’m not sure if it’s one of those things people say but don’t expect a follow through on, or if it is something where they want you to come. I don’t mind going at all, but I also really don’t want to impose. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 
 Ps: lady gave me a bag of pears too and refused to let me pay. She was so nice 😭😭

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically near my house, there is this street food stall which I frequently visit after work to have dinner. They sell Phở and other kinds of noodle soup.
 But they also sell this dish. I don't know what's the correct name for it in English, but it's pork's brain boiled in water and added with some herbs. It's called "Óc Trần"
 So I came in and ordered a bowl of Phở. The owner nodded, signaling that he heard it. I suddenly felt the urge to eat that pork brain dish, I then spoke out loud to me, saying,
 "Anh còn óc không vậy?" Which is roughly translated to "Do you have any brain left at all?" 
 The owner looked very shell-shocked at me, looking very confused. I thought he didn't heard me correctly, I spoke even louder, "Anh có óc không ạ?", which is "Do you have brain?"
 The whole stall and everyone on the tables were looking at me confusingly, and the owner looked even more shell-shocked! I still then didn't understand what was wrong, I told him that, "Óc trần ạ!", which is "Boiled brain!". He changed his facial expression immediately to smiling, lol
 Sitting down, I still didn't firgure out why he and other people looking at me that weirdly. It took me a few minites to realize how horrible that could come across, lol! In vietnam, if we tell someone that they have no brain, or ask them if they have brain or not, it means that we are insulting them and telling them they are dumb and stupid! Lol!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like, it's just suck. And here's why:
  
Memorization: While memorization IS a necessary skill for real life, it's one of the most useless one. There is loads of other skills an education system should focus on for helping students with later life. However, just look at the Vietnamese textbook. What did you see? IT'S JUST MEMORY! There is nearly no other skills. Critical thinking? Zero. Creativity? Zero. Heck, only logical thinking has some representation, and that representation is minuscule in my opnion. I can't think of a reason why don't they teach other skills rather than just memorization.
 Obsession over Grade: This is the worst problem by a long shot. Due to (let me check what it's called...) confucianism, the Vietnamese people value education. Don't get me wrong, this is a good thing, but for some reasons, it has turned into an obsession over grade and score. And well, just google "bệnh thành tích" to see how bad it is. Tbh, I think it is not exactly the fault of the Ministry of Education, but it's too popular to not mention.
 Underpaid teacher: Self-explanatory. This forced teachers to teach more in bonus class (idk how to translate học thêm, sorry) and create more stress to already stressed kid.
 Boring asf: Also self-explanatory
  
Tbf, they are trying to fix these problem, and while they are not even close to fix these, theres still some progress. Hopefully they can fix all of this in near future
 (sorry for any mistake)

At noon time on August 22, 2023, I parked my red Honda Wave motorbike across from Eddie's Wok in Thao Dien. Specifically, it was a sidewalk with other parked motorbikes, so I figured it might be a parking spot, even though there were no guards. It was stupid of me to believe that surveillance cameras would deter any bike thieves. I stopped at Eddie's for lunch and when I was done, I found my motorbike to be missing. I reported it to the authority of phường Thảo Điền and it was all that I could do. 
 I now realized that I was naive to park at a place with no security. I really liked that bike and I've had a lot of good memories with it. I also lost two helmets and a raincoat was on the bike. Like I said, I've never experienced theft before and I really hope that the police can get it back. But in the mean time, I've been blaming myself and the memory of the shocking realization is still coming back. What should I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys!
 A group of friends and I booked a trip to Viet Nam on a whim because the flights happened to be quite cheap from Indonesia end of August.
 We will be landing in Da Lat which we were interested in because the city looks unique, and will be departing from Ho Chi Minh city. We'll be there 28th Aug to 7th Sep. Currently the plan is to be in Da Lat for 3 nights in the beginning, then in Ho Chi Minh City from 3 Sep onwards. This leaves the 31st to 3rd on our schedule empty for potential things we can do. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations on things to do or places to go/stay on those middle 3 nights? Maybe somewhere off Da Lat and HCMC, or on the way between those two cities?
 For example we were potentially looking at checking Bao Loc out for something kinda off the beaten tourist path, but are wondering about how to get around within the city there. Is Grab readily available etc. 
 Second thing we were wondering about is how reliable the inter-city buses are. We could find schedules but can't figure out how to book them online, so is it simple to go to the bus station and book tickets? How early in advance should we book them and do the tickets run out fast on the routes from Da Lat -> HCMC? Also would you even recommend going by bus between cities for tourists with no command of the Vietnamese language save for Google Translate camera? We were thinking of going by bus for a more affordable experience and to sightsee/experience how traveling through the country by land is, but of course a plane ride between the two cities is still an option.
 Really excited to visit Viet Nam as I've never been there and I appreciate any help you guys can give! Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mình năm nay 19 tuổi, đang học tại đại học mà mình không tiện nói tên. Trước khi lên đại học mình đã mong muốn và nghĩ rằng khi lên đại học, tập thể lớp sẽ rất vui nhộn như cấp 2 hoặc cấp 3, thậm chí là hơn cả thế, nhưng mà mình đã vỡ mộng hoàn toàn sau 1 năm theo học cùng lớp. Số buổi lên lớp của trường mình không nhiều, chỉ có 3-4 buổi mỗi tuần. Lớp mình là một tập thể không đông, trước đó thì có 20 người nhưng sau đó vì nhiều người không theo được nên đã chọn đổi ngành hoặc trường nên cuối cùng lớp mình chỉ còn có 14 người. Ngỡ tưởng dân số ít thì mọi người sẽ mở lòng giao tiếp với nhau nhiều hơn nhưng kết cục vẫn đâu vào đó, ai cũng khiêm tốn và kiệm lời, chẳng có sự sôi nổi, chẳng cãi vã, chẳng tranh luận, lớp lặng im, đã vậy còn chia thành các nhóm nhỏ khác rồi chơi cùng nhau trong vòng đó (đa phần quen nhau từ trước), mình cũng có một nhóm nhưng hiện tại thì chỉ còn mình mình vì những người khác rời đi hết. Biết trước chuyện này xảy ra nên ban đầu mình có giao tiếp hay lại gần để trò chuyện cùng các nhóm khác, nhưng mà nỗ lực có vẻ không thành khi mình ăn trái bơ nhiều và các bạn có vẻ không muốn tiếp tục cuộc hội thoại. Không chỉ trên lớp mà thậm chí trên mạng xã hội, mỗi lớp đều sẽ có một nhóm zalo để chia sẻ thông tin cũng như trò chuyện, nhưng mà kì lạ là nhóm lớp chẳng ai nói cũng chẳng ai hỏi, vài tuần thì có tin nhắn thông báo sau đó lại chìm nghỉm, mình nói gì mình hỏi gì cũng đều nhận lại được đó là một đống bơ từ cả lớp, trong khi mọi tin nhắn khác mình đều thả tim hoặc rep lại để tạo sự tương tác 😢 biết là chẳng có gì đáng trách nhưng cảm giác quá đáng thật. Mọi người có giải pháp nào cho mình để có thể kết thân cùng lớp không ạ? Ai cũng bảo hãy tận hưởng đời sống sinh viên mà sao mình không thấy gì đáng tận hưởng hết á.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suddenly feeling the urge to ask this question, because while the US is more well-known to be more open-minded about gender expression, I feel that the male beauty standard there is actually quite strict and harsh. 
 I only see the most buff, shredded, muscular guys being presented in American movies and series, and only them is positively presented. The "nerds" and the skinnier guys are often portrayed as a joke, a laughingstock. This might be a blindspot of mine, and I might be jumping to conclusion too early with not enough observation. But I feel the male beauty standard in the West, or at least the US, is very big, very jock-like, buff-y, brute, masculine-ish.
 And while Asia, or Vietnam, is said to be more conservative, but I actually feel like we allow men to be more things. The big, buffy with tan lines image is accepted. Also accepted is the slim, fair skin, quieter, smart, sweet and soft-spoken, "thư sinh" type. Nobody has to be big and shredded with 6 packs to be considered a man. Am I right about this?

 Local food is GREAT, but I definitely need more protein in my diet on top of that.
 Gonna start eating a bunch of eggs, but I still need protein powder and perhaps there is some local food I don't know about?
 Something with soy maybe?

 I’ll start - overrated - got to be bà nà hills. I know a lot of people don’t rate it to begin with, but I just think it’s got no value at all tbh. 
 Underrated - Vũng tàu, I really love this small beach town, perfect place to day trip from HCMC

I am looking to get some moving blankets to hang up over my door and windows to block out some of the sound (pic attached). However I can’t find these blankets anywhere on shopee/figure out what the Vietnamese translation for them would be. They are extremely thick and heavy blankets and used to protect furniture when moving. If anyone could let me know where I could buy these in Hanoi/online for shipping in Vietnam that would be a huge help! Also if anyone has any recommendations for a shop in ba Dinh that could do some sewing as well I’d appreciate it.

Like I get mixing the languages, especially when you’re talking to someone in Vietnamese about something that originally happened in English, but I’ve noticed that people seem to favor using the words “parking” and “move” instead of the perfectly serviceable Vietnamese equivalents, even when the rest of their sentence is in Vietnamese. Like one time a pregnant lady was talking about how she could feel her baby move and instead of saying thấy em bé đạp she said thấy em bé move (except it sounded like moo with her accent lol). Any idea why people do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We visited Huế not too long ago on our trip through Vietnam, and it quickly became one of our favorite stops of the whole trip. We only had one day there as our visas were expiring, but we were able to cram a good amount of stuff in to that 24 hours... considering 8 of them were spent sleeping. 
 We would have loved to explore outside of the city a little more. The walking street is small but lively, the food is incredible. One of our best dining experiences in Vietnam (I mean, seriously, bún bò Huế?) and the Imperial City is massive. One of our favorite archaeological sites we've visited. 
 I noticed when we were doing research, it doesn't seem to get as many searches or views on YouTube and other sites the way Hoi An or Da Nang do. It's a shame. I think it's very under rated. 
 Why do you think this is? We'd love to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am a Vietnamese American who lived in the US for almost 18 years. I will be moving to live in Vietnam for 2-3 years soon. Over in the US, I worked in a logistics company for 2 years and I have my Bachelor's degree. 
 My cousin who is in the logistic field recommends that I teach English instead ( I do not really want to continue my logistic career either tbh) because the job prospect in VN is not great for logistics.
 However, I do not want to teach large groups of people. Is it easy for new English teachers to find jobs teaching small groups or even 1-on1? Does anyone here teaches English but only work with small group or individuals?
 I heard being an English teaching assistant was decent, does anyone have experience in this job?
 What about teaching Vietnamese to foreigners in Vietnam? 
 I am a little bit lost when thinking of jobs and it is creating some anxiety.
 Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.

 I was wondering if it's possible to travel up to forests with a scooter and just walk in a little bit, so I can sit there alone. Is it safe regarding animals, and how likely is it the forest is private property and I'm not supposed to be there?

 Anyone living in Vietnam, or especially the northern part of it, would certainly understand the pressure put down on the men in the family line to get married and have children. But the thing is that I'm gay, and I'm not planning anywhere in the future to deceive any girl into a marriage with a guy who doesn't love them, just for my selfish motivation, which is to "fulfill responsibility." Despite having had many girls showing interests and some even confessing their love for me, it would just be a very cruel act to rob away a girl's chance of true love and happiness in life just for my selfish reason. 
 And I don't want to have any kids either, even if I'm a straight guy. But my mother is getting older too, and she does deserve having a grandchild to care for, to have someone to brighten and bring her happiness at her later years. But even for that, I could just adopt a child, there's no need to lure a girl into marriage just to have a child.
 But I don't even want to adopt kids. Best case scenario, I found a guy who's my true love, we're both financially stable enough to be able to adopt and raise a child with love. Much more likely, I would end up alone, I much more prefer it that way though. Living to the very end of my 40s, then that's enough.
 Do you know anyone who's a Vietnamese, who chose to live like me, choosing to live alone for the rest of their lives? Do they got respected? Do other Vietnamese look down on them?

I’ve been travelling SE Asia for a few months and decided, against advice, to stop in Nha Trang for two nights. I was super tired from travelling and just wanted to stop for a couple days before continuing on north. I actually thought it was a nice place for a stop over. It felt calm and I relaxed a bit, but I started feeling a bit disconnected after two nights so moved on to Danang.
 Pros:
  
surprisingly calm place. I’ve been enjoying sitting in coffee shops in the streets set back from the beach which were actually quite nice to explore. Quite leafy and relaxed pace after coming from HCMC which I did not enjoy.
 
nice people and a mix too. Honestly I’d heard so many negative things about Russians and Chinese. Russians largely keep to …]]></summary>

 We were in one of the huge malls (Aeon mall) to have dinner. Public dining area was packed, but we managed to fine a table. The thing is the previous customers left their trash on the table, so we asked a cleaner to clean the table. Then, the most shocking and unacceptable thing had happened. Because the tissue paper dispenser was empty, the cleaner casually and probably out of habit took some tissues from the TRASH CAN and cleaned our table. Like what in the world! 
 We just couldn't shake the experience off and duly reported it to the mall authorities. 
 Wow! I just can't get over it somehow. It's like the experience has turned into a nasty core memory. 😂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hate propaganda as much as the next guy, but the fact that modern Viet Nam don't have any good war, horror, fantasy, historical movies and tv shows, boggles my mind. You would assumed that with the long history of conflict, diverse culture, fantastic mythology, long history AND state funded is a thing AND modern technology AND already tried and succeed examples (see movies from China, Korea, Japan, UK) even countries like INDIA, NORWAY, TURKEY, are stepping up their game with movies and tv series. Same go for video games. Don't even get me started on the propaganda movies, especially with the propaganda movies, propaganda war movies about war heroes are the easiest to make IMHO, should be easily State funded, so many war heroes to take inspiration from ( and if you're saying they aren't real because their story are too crazy, remember Hacksaw Ridge is based on a real story), so many examples from successful movies to take notes. So stop making "comedy" and "in-law drama" please.

Is it better to book online or go there and try to book it in person?

 You can talk about munchies from anywhere. One of my top top munchies is Cheez-it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm planning a 1.5 week long trip to Vietnam, flying into HCMC. I would most likely plan a few nights in the city to explore it, but I mostly want to spend time in nature and relax, as a mental health retreat and for the fact that I can't walk a lot anyway due to physical issues.
 I'm looking for an area not too far from HCMC, that's not too hard to reach with public transport of private transport. An area with some decent but affordable hotels. 
 What would you recommend?

 While the SMS messages were coming through, I noticed that the phone network had changed from Mobiphone to Vinaphone (or similar - I don't remember the name exactly. It wasn't viettel.)
 Next morning when I checked phone the network had gone back to the previous automatic select setting: Mobiphone. Again, no SMS's received. 
 I remember the same issue happened a few years ago, but it was promptly sorted out. This occasion, I've reported the issue to THree (UK). They are yet to revert to me with an explanation and/or workaround. 
 Anyone encounter similar issue when using your home country mobile in Vietnam?. Are you able to send and received SMS message?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife (vietnamese) and I (Austrian) are thinking about buying some property in Vietnam. Possibly as investment but also as a future home for ourselves. We currently live in Europe but probably want to move to Saigon in the future to be closer to my parents in law.
  
Is there anything we have to keep in mind about the citizenship of my wife? She is thinking of becoming Austrian citizen but unfortunately Austria doesn't allow dual citizenship, meaning she needs to give up her vietnamese passport. Can we still purchase real estate in Vietnam although none of us will be vietnamese citizenship? If we buy a property before she changes her nationality, will it have any legal consequences regarding the property?
 
What are some recommended webpages to look for properties (south Vietnam, Saigon, Da Lat) online? (vietnamese only is fine)
 
Is there any kind of public accessible data about average prices per square meter for different regions across the south of Vietnam?
 
Is it common in Vietnam to hire an agent when buying a property which does the searching for us and asks for a reasonable commission? How would we go about finding someone professional?We are not searching for and cannot afford a luxury property. E.g. I doubt we can afford something in downtown Saigon.
 
Any other obvious pitfalls that we should know of? I know that we are very much at the beginning of the process and we are both pretty clueless. I'm more of the "handyman" in the relationship but unfortunately I do not speak vietnamese yet and it's hard for me to research by myself. Hence it's a learning process that me and my wife have to go through together. 
 
 Thanks a lot for any input and help!

 The app told us to go to the pick up area, which we did. There's a brunch of guys there, which I knew was very suspicious, so I chose to ignore them. 
  
The Grab driver then called and told me that he's about 20 minutes away, he's stuck in traffic and asked that I cancel the ride. I told him the app showed that he's on the other side of the parking lot. He hung up cause my internet was shitty, then we exchanged texts where we pretty much said the same thing a second time. I told him that he is committing fraud and he needs to cancel if he's not ready to pick us up. He then end…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just to preface this I know I'm a sad old man and I hate fun. I don't like drinking or going to clubs and bars so I generally avoid them. Despite this I don't mind them existing because they are easily avoidable.
 I am currently travelling in Vietnam and it would seem that the karaoke is impossible to avoid, generally because it is so loud and there are so many karaoke bars. Here in Dalat some of them seem to operate even in the middle of the day. Even the staff at my hostel do it (none of the guests seem to participate). This isn't just for a couple hours in the evening either, they seem to enjoy doing it constantly from 6pm to 10pm. 4 hours of this shit? Really?
 I suppose aside from ranting my question is why is everybody expected to tolerate this intrusive activity in Vietnam? Does everyone enjoy listening to this or do they just accept that it exists and move on? Also, are there any actual rules around karaoke bars I.e. when and where they are allowed to operate?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I'm 25 vietnamese male, used to get in a university but dropped out due to financial problem, just finished military service this year. I'm studying programming at a education center, and going to finish in the next 2 month.
 I've always want to study abroad to have a wider and better view of the world we've living in. And also, since I have never complete my college, I want to continute it by participating in a international university to accomplish a degree in computer science. I'm planning to actually do it by the age of 30 (I don't think I will get married by that time). I'm just wondering is there any cases like me in Vietnam and actually get into a foreign college by 30 or older? Because when I try to google my concern, the result I get seem mostly come from already developed conutries.

 Anyone who flew with new unopened electronics in their carry on out of Noi Bai before -- did they make you unbox your device at security to put through the x-ray scanner? or can you just scan it with the box and packaging and everything still intact? 
 Should I just store it in my checked baggages instead? The device's battery is under 100Wh (75Wh) -- both Canada CATSA and the U.S. FAA allow it to be checked in, just needs to be turned off and well packed.

 I know in America at least Vietnamese cuisine is largely stuck in the 70s. Is this a phrase that has always existed, or is it a new word? I only really hear it from hipster white people who love categorizing and labeling things.

I gotta go because he’s a good friend and plus I really want to. Problem is that I have a mild tree nut allergy and deadly peanut allergy. My friend promised he’ll translate and won’t let anything happen to me but I’m worried that either he won’t say the right thing, the chefs won’t understand what that means or there will be cross contamination because food allergies aren’t really a thing there as y’all probably know, and they may not follow strict food guidelines like they do not the states. Any tips for a fella in this situation? My plan is to stick to white rice and McDonald’s as much as possible but idk if I can do that for 10 days.

 I’ve spent the last month travelling Vietnam, starting in the north and working my way south. I arrived in HCMC a couple days ago and have noticed a ton of places have a security guard sitting on a plastic chair outside. A lot of these seem to be restaurants or higher end retailers. 
 I didn’t notice anything like this in any other Vietnamese city I’ve visited and I’m curious what the difference is. Are there a lot of thefts in HCMC? Is it to make sure nobody accosts tourists? Is it just to make places seem so fancy they need a guard? They seem to mostly be browsing their phones but maybe I’m missing something. What’s with all the protection?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are my thoughts on my visit to VN after living abroad for 38 years
 1) shocked by the traffic Pedestrian and motorized vehicles completely mixed together 2) not accessible to handicapped 3) service is top notched if you interact with people on a personal level . lots of self employed people , owners are always on site and care about their business 
 I ordered a birthday cake and the bakery will deliver to the restaurant!!!!
 4) in the absence of personal interaction, people behaviour is just horrible , pushing others , never wait in line (I.e. when I was at the airport )
 5) phone service is so cheap , everyone is glued to their phone 
 6) the gap between the rich and the poor is just too much

 I mean, we're all stuck in the same situation, right? It feels counterproductive and just adds to the noise and stress. Anyone else feel the same?

My education was in a country and time very anticommunist, and I have discovered prosperous VietNam about 5 years. My formation is in Physics, so I am a late student about Marxism.
 Here in Brazil, most of people believes USA won VietNam war and that your country is a big and poor "gueto". I got surprised (5 years ago, when I began to search for "where socialism works well") to discover Vietnamese heros beated the Yankees.
 I have much respect for all Vietnamese people, you are heros or hero's sons and daughters. I want to learn much about dialectic materialism and how your children are educated to build a so great country and nation.
 Unfortunately, I can't speak Vietnamese, so I use Yankee-idiom. I tried to learn your language, but it was hard to me, so I'm learning mandarin first, so I could familiarize with a softer tonal idiom first.
 Love and respect to you Vietnamese!
 Peace among us, war to the lords!

 I am travelling to Vietnam from the 2nd to the 12th Initially I had planned for go from HCM to Da Nang, chill in Hoi An for a bit and go where the wind takes me for the rest of the holiday. Ideally wanted sunny weather, heat with diving and lazing on a beach. I've been doing some more research and checking 10 day forecast and a lot I've read is that the weather is potentially going to be the complete opposite of what I was wanting. 
 Can anyone give me some insight on where else I should go for my beach holiday or regardless it's going to be a toss of the dice no matter where I go? 
 Thanks!

Just wondering which is nicer, we are not looking for a western Christmas.

 Any festivities to check out or must-dos for Tet Trung Thu that might influence where we want to be for that day?

It’s probably a tourist trap but there was many lovely vendors. No pushy or forceful people. Maybe one or two but only in the minority. I could browse easily and didn’t feel like anyone was going to shout at me. 
 I didn’t buy anything today apart from a scarf. Can anyone tell me how the bargaining works here. Some said fixed prices some said give me your price. I tried halving but some “said sorry no we cannot do it.” Then we came to an agreeable rate But it was only the vendors I purchased from. I didn’t barter with others but the price was really high for some stuff. 
 Any help?

What makes you/your family member choose fish sauce? (packaging, taste,…)
 How can you tell between poor fish sauce and tasty one? 
 What do you prefer: bad fish sauce at a reasonable price or tasty fish sauce at a higher price?
 Are you willing to try new fish sauce that you have not tried before, or you’re going to be loyal to fish sauce that you like?
 What aspects of fish sauce do you care more about: smell, color of the fish sauce, or both? 
 To what extent do you think fish sauce is unique to Vietnamese daily cuisine?
  
Please help me win this case competition. Thank you! ❤️

Ở Việt Nam, tụi mình khi đi ăn cùng bạn bè sẽ thường kiểu gọi đầy bàn đồ ăn ra, sau đó khi có bill thì share theo đầu người. Hoặc là hôm nay người này mời, hôm sau người kia mời.
 Nhưng mà hình như ở nước ngoài không giống vậy nhỉ. Họ sẽ gọi đồ ăn của họ và chỉ tính tiền phần ăn đó, còn của mình sẽ tự trả của mình. Sự khác biệt này vô cùng thú vị, có thể cho thấy khác biệt văn hóa giữa cách chi trả của từng quốc gia. Các bạn đang sống ở nước ngoài và sống ở Việt Nam có thể bàn luận một chút không?

 Tôi hỏi diễn đàn này vì tôi nghe nói cuốn sách có lượng người theo dõi lớn hơn nhiều ở Việt Nam. Có ai biết thêm về 'M' không? Nếu bạn có thêm tài nguyên về cuộc sống của những người được miêu tả trong cuốn sách, vui lòng chia sẻ =)

 He agreed to let me travel with him (I begged him 100 times 😅).
 He informed his family about me. His dad, big brother, sister in law and younger sister were very excited, and his mum seemed neutral.
 We would spend 5 days in Hanoi with his family and visit Danang before coming back 🇩🇪.
 His parents said I could stay in their house. They have a big house, so there are private spaces for me and boyfriend.
 I feel excited and concerned at the same time. Is it too “friendly” if I stay in their house? Or staying in hotel is safer option 
 What should I do to maintain good relationship with them as a westerner? If I stay with them, I can join their daily activities (cooking,…) and that’ll be fun 😁
 I prepared some gifts for his little sister. She’s so sweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Besides the government structure, what is socialist about Vietnam. It seems to me like people here operate on the most extreme capitalist mindset even more so than capitalist countries. There are more social safety nets, social goods, social ideologies in Europe, Australia, or USA, than there are here. Just as a quick dumb example: there are way more parks and public areas in any of those countries than here. And the few ones that there are here always end up overrun with people trying to sell crap. In "capitalist countries" more people tend to agree collectively to leave public places for the public. They (usually) tend agree to pay taxes to fund all sorts of social services. It seems to me that in Vietnam everyone is always chasing the most minor personal gain even at the cost of social advancements for all. What is social about Vietnam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a Vietnamese-American who traveled to Vietnam to see my family and I happened to meet a girl at a spa on my last day in Vietnam. (It was at a highly rated spa with legit services)
 I thought she was attractive so I started up a conversation to get to know her and she said she didn’t have a boyfriend. I got her instagram and we started to talk for a month. She was very enthusiastic (never one word answers) and flirty with all her responses except I always had to start all the conversations. I recently told her I was really interested in her but that it would be difficult for us to maintain a relationship being so far away from each other and she said she was interested too and that if we “really loved” then it would work. 
 However, I went through her instagram followers and found her boyfriend that she has been dating for like 9 months. She doesn’t have any photos of him on her instagram but the boyfriend has all the photos of her on his profile. 
 After finding out, I didn’t confront her about it and immediately stopped messaging her and she hasn’t messaged me either but that wasn’t surprising to me because I was always the one to start the conversations. I guess I can understand why now because she has a boyfriend… Even though, we haven’t talked for a week, she still shows interest by liking my instagram stories.
 My question is why would she deceive me like this and waste all of my time? Was she ever actually interested in me?
 Part of me just wants to screenshot all the messages and send it to the boyfriend

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live away from my family for just 10 years. However, the relationship between me and my parents was never good. I am close with my sister and my niece but the last time I saw them was 7 years ago. To be fair, we are all different people now. Although we text, call, talking in person is still another thing. 
 I left the country for education, for work but I also wanted to stay away from my family. Just typical Asian parents problems. Since moving away from them, our relationship got somewhat better, just because I don’t have to deal with bullshit anymore.
 I tried to put a smile on my face, I told my self that they will just stay for 1 month, I will be okay. But just 30 mins and I already felt depressed. It started with they filming me the second they saw me at the airport, shared it on Facebook and Tiktok, then with them trying to “help” me. Then they took off their shoes and put their feet on another seat when we were on public transport. I understand their motives, I just couldn’t stand it. The things they talk about, I can’t join. The things they do, I am not comfortable to. The cultural difference between us is big enough to keep us apart.
 I am worried that this trip will push me and my family away even further. 27 more days to go, and I don’t know how I should approach it.

 I'm coming to Vietnam in the third week of September and my dream for this trip is to do some deep water soloing. I've never done it so I'm in need of a guide. (I am an experienced boulderer, but not the greatest swimmer. I'm trying to get over my fear of jumping in the water from heights....)
 If anyone knows any current climbing or adventure companies that organize tours or day trips or even just some guy with a boat and a topo I'd be psyched to hear about it!

 I will be visiting your beautiful country from January to March next year
 I'd like to spend most of my time near the beach, but still have good infrastructure, so Da Nang and Nha Trang make sense to me
 Air quality and water quality (for swimming at the beaches) are important 
 Being able to walk or bike most places is also nice, though good public transportation helps too
 I'd also like to be able to make genuine connections with people (both locals and immigrants)
 What do you recommend?

Should I use Remitly to send the money back there (I've heard they have the option where you will be receiving dollar bills from the comfort of you home), and then I can go to "tiệm vàng" later to exchange them? Or should I paypal my brother's bank account in Vietnam? Also, what is the best bank for me to open later when I'm back there? Thanks in advance for any comments.

 I like music that's considered on the alternative side, everything from pop punk to death metal. 
 Most of the Vietnamese people I've met like to listen to ballads, which I don't mind but I would rarely put some on.
 My niece and nephew just showed me the 7uppercuts and I really liked their stuff. Currently Tron Tim is on a loop and it will be for a while. 
 Can you guys recommend me more alternative music? I'm currently in the mood for pop punk but feel free to send me heavier stuff.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit of a two part question. To preface for context - I am a Vietnamese person that grew up in the US. My Vietnamese speaking abilities is very bare-bones and simple. As such, when I went back to Vietnam, it was quite easy to identify me as a Viet-Kieu the second I opened my mouth.
 Now this prompted some thought and curiosity within me. For the typical local Vietnamese person, is it possible to identify the country that the VK person is from based off of their speech pattern/accent?
 Furthermore, do foreigners from different countries have different accents when speaking Vietnamese? For example, in the US, there is a distinctive difference between Latinos speaking english, Asians speaking English, Europeans speaking English, etc. As well, within those groups, you have subtler differences too. Like the French accent is different than the UK English accent. Vietnamese people speaking English have a different sound to Japanese people speaking English. Does this phenomenon occur in Vietnamese too?

However i started to wonder if it’s actually vietnamese or more “viet inspired.” It’s a relatively simple vermicelli salad with toppings like beef, egg rolls, veggies. Is it “authentic”? 
 Both of my parents are from vietnam but i was born in america, so i wouldn’t say i was an expert on viet cuisine but i wondered if this is more of a fusion dish like orange chicken. My parents said they don’t know any dishes called just “bò bún” but that “bún thịt nướng” exists in VN for example. Does “bò bún” or anything like that exist in vietnam/vietnamese cuisine? if so what would be the closest to this dish?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anytime anyone says anything slightly critical of this country, the entire community will either be up in arms telling the foreigners to leave or insult them. Case in point the earlier ‘satire’ post, and many comments defending rude behaviours. 
 I don’t normally post or comment much, but the more I check out this subreddit the more I realise how terrible the mentality of the people in Vietnam is. 
 As A Viet diaspora, I really wanted to be proud of my heritage and culture, but it is just so hard. I am sure many second generation overseas Viets have this feeling as well. 
 Every time I see Vietnamese people from Vietnam while traveling overseas, the majority of them are extremely loud, oblivious to the people around them, and have terrible manners/ behaviours (eating with mouth open food flying everywhere like tf?). It is just so embarrassing every single time.
 Yes, Some polite behaviours are relative, however there is still a core set of behaviours that is consistent everywhere, such as, do not block the path, do not spit on the streets etc. One can’t just hide behind the concept of relativeness and ignore reality altogether. 
 I am both sad and angry because I know the Vietnamese are capable, but they just refuse to change or listen to criticism.
 Edit: Future readers can observe the comments and judge for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I recently had the experience of getting to spend 3 weeks in Da Nang for business.
 I absolutely fell in love with Vietnam and have more than a passing curiosity to pursue a life there when I have completed my current employment contract.
 The thing is, I didn’t run into a single expat who wasn’t someone from NZ/AUS and on holiday money/trust fund living. They weren’t actually working, just long term hanging out.
 So for my expats who DO make a living contributing to Vietnam’s prosperity, what are some of the usual occupations expats do?
 My most current occupational background is in aviation maintenance , but I also have a masters in International Relations, and over 20 years of kitchen/food prep/food service. 
 I saw that there’s no “pensioner visa”, which would be nice because I’m expecting a pension of around $3000/month in about 5-8 years, but I don’t mind working past my first retirement.

 Would love to hear some positive things, as I had my heart set on HCMC but I think Bien Hoa looks just as amazing and I think it would be a stepping stone into the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Theo Tòa án tối cao Hoa Kỳ, trước khi thẩm vấn, cảnh sát phải thông báo cho nghi phạm hình sự như sau:
 "Anh có quyền giữ im lặng và từ chối trả lời câu hỏi. Bất cứ điều gì anh nói cũng sẽ được dùng để chống lại anh trước tòa. Anh có quyền có luật sư trước khi khai báo với cảnh sát và luật sư sẽ hiện diện khi cảnh sát thẩm vấn anh. Nếu anh không thể tìm được luật sư, anh sẽ được cung cấp một luật sư trước khi trả lời các câu hỏi. Anh có thể trả lời câu hỏi khi không có luật sư, nhưng anh vẫn có quyền ngưng trả lời bất cứ lúc nào để chờ sự có mặt của luật sư".
 Điều này có nghĩa là không ai được phép cưỡng ép nghi phạm trả lời bất kỳ một câu hỏi nào khi không có mặt luật sư và trước khi ra toà thì nghi phạm cứ giữ im lặng thoải mái.
 Các quyền này là cơ bản trong nhân quyền và được áp dụng ở tất cả các quốc gia dân chủ. Theo tao nghiên cứu thì luật tố tụng hình sự Việt Nam không có điều nào thể hiện rõ những quyền này cả. Vậy nên bức cung, ép cung nó mới phổ biến và gây ra nhiều vụ án oan sai.

 I'll be coming to Vietnam for work, and as a first-timer in the country, I want to make sure I'm well-prepared for my arrival, and I'm looking forward to your insights on what to expect and how to handle the arrival process smoothly.
 If you've been to Hanoi Airport before or have experience with arriving in Vietnam, I'd love to hear from you! What are the steps you recommend taking upon arrival at Hanoi Airport? Any tips for immigration, baggage claim, customs, currency exchange, transportation, and getting settled into accommodation would be greatly appreciated.
 Additionally, if you have any advice on local customs, cultural norms, or must-try experiences in Hanoi, I'm all ears. I believe that learning from others' experiences can truly enrich my journey.

 I use Duolingo right now, however I feel like they don’t explain the language very well and I need my partner to explain everything to me. 
 Does anyone know an app/book to help me learn basic conversations? 
 Thanks in advance :)

 So to the Vietnamese users of this sub, how do you feel about each of the SEA countries? Aside from Vietnam (of course), which one is your favorite? (Probabaly gonna see a lot of "anh em Lào" comments here haha)

 Cảm giác khi bị cắn: nhức (như bị ong đốt). Sau đó có là cảm giác nhức nhối lan dần ở đầu ngón trỏ (vì mình cắn ở đầu ngón tay) nhưng mình đã chặn cơn đau này bằng cách siết ngón trỏ lại. Sau đó rửa bằng xà phòng cà dùng povidine 10%. Hiện tại, ngón tay của mình cảm thấy hơi nhức (không quá nhức như ban đầu), căng cứng và tê ở đốt ngón tay đầu tiên.
 I was sleeping when I was bitten by this one, I looked up the information and only knew its name is "ectomocoris elegans" and belongs to the family of Hemeptera. If anyone has more information about it, please let me know. But now I can't go back to sleep because of the pain 🥲. Sensation when bitten: pain (like being stung by a bee). After that, there was a burning pain in the tip of my index finger (because I bit the tip of my finger) but I stopped this pain by squeezing my index finger. Then wash with soap and use povidine 10%. Currently, my fingers feel a little sore (not too sore like the original), tight and numb in the first knuckle.

 A friend of mine living in France wants to marry his vietnamese girlfriend so he can have a longer visa, or she can leave the country to have a better salary (the ideal solution). He recently found out that his gf's mom faked her birth year so she could legally work at 14. 10 years later, now that her mom isn't responsible of her child fake birth certificate anymore (is it true?), she told the authorities about that. Therefore they believe mariage isn't possible anymore and both fear the government repression.
 Is there any solution to that ? It's difficult to find any informations about vietnamese government and law on the internet by not speaking or writing vietnamese well.
 Also, I personally fear that this could be a gigantic scam. Is it some deja vu story ?
 Thanks.

 My girlfriend (who is viet) and I are going to Vietnam in October. We've tentatively decided Oct 9th - 23rd or around there. Now I've been to Asia before and was in Hong Kong in april myself to visit my family along with my gf.
 I am wondering if I should be taking any preparations food wise , as I am aware that the food hygiene is not that great. I also don't want a repeat of what I experienced as a kid in HK 20 years ago (diarrhea and the shits and vomiting) lol. In my experience, it was herbs and ice water that gave me problems, but I was wondering if I should be more careful?
 Second question is -Im bringing a camera along with me for travels, but its quite an expensive camera. My girlfriend was discussing this with me and told me to be carefeul about it being snatched. Therefore I am wondering i should take extra precautions with getting a security strap thats securely anchored so that no body can just snatch it away from me. Is theft an issue?
 ​
 Thanks

But then I just noticed local women almost every 10-15 min in nice dresses having their photos taken in all sorts of settings. Alleys, bridges, in front of abandoned buildings and steel gates. 
 And many will have 1-3 men with large lenses taking their photos. 
 Is this a typical tradition in HCMC / Saigon? Photos for online dating? Wedding photos? Social media flex?
 Visiting HCMC / Saigon for the first time. Haven’t seen anything similar in other SEA cities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a college student in Hanoi who is a thrift enthusiast and want to practice my English speaking skills.
 So I will volunteer to guide anyone who like thrifting to explore the real thrift markets in Ha Noi. I will help you bargain good price, find the place to shop for cool stuff, give you some tips to explore Hanoi, and maybe eat some street food while we go.
 Places im planning to go:
 - Đông Tác Market (all kind of second-hand stuff)
 - Đặng Văn Ngữ Market (cheaper than Đông Tác and has mostly women clothes)
 - Hoàng Tích Trí Street (leather goods)
 All of these places are in Đống Đa District
 Available time: 1 PM - 6:30 PM, every weekend
 Just sent me a message, I will create a group and then we will go together.

 Can you relate?
 “If I go back to Vietnam, could I go with this person? And you realize no. They would not make a good travel companion, they would not get it. And if they do not get Vietnam I don’t know whether I can be friends with them anymore. That’s a terrible thing to admit. Your perspective have shiftet. You cannot look at your old life the same way. When you know things could be different.”

 Also, in general, travel tips would really really help us! What places should we cover and what are absolute gems? Is safety a concern we should have? I am from India bdw. We are planning to book a return flight from a different city than the city we will be landing in since we wish to cover many places. Also, we will be in Vietnam for around 10 days. 
 I also wanted to confirm if USD is accepted everywhere. We will also be carrying Forex cards. 
 I really apologize for so many questions. This will be my first international trip. Really excited to visit your beautiful country and amazing people!!!
 Thank you in advance!

 Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead is published by Tre Publishing (owned by Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union btw). AFAIK, it’s very popular among younger readers. 
 Fun fact: Ayn Rand was extremely vocal against the Vietnam War believing Communism would have collapsed without intervention (lol?) while the voice of America, John Steinbeck, publicly supported the war (in private, it was more complex than that). He also famously hated ideological orthodoxy i.e even calling champagne socialists “temporarily embarrassed capitalists” (sound familiar?). This might be why it took until 2021 for Steinbeck magnum opus “East of Eden” to be released in Vietnam.

Flex tí nhưng, ai cũng sẽ tưởng một đứa thế này thì lo quái gì. Em thành thật em khá lo về cái long run cho sự nghiệp. Em đang học tài chính vì nó hay và rộng nhưng em thật sự chưa biết cái gì phù hợp. Cái chính là ở đại học em chưa biết nên chú trọng cái gì ạ, em có thử tham gia các CLB nhưng failed. Em cũng muốn đi thi case nhưng chưa đủ kiến thức. Em còn định thưc tập nhưng chưa có công ty tuyển. Địng hướng của em đang định vào big3 consulting hay big4, em cũng khá muốn làm về data hay business analyst. Nhưng em lại thấy khá nản và yêu cầu rất cao kiểu em not good enough. Hiện tại em thực sự mê consulting và em cần một số lời khuyên để nổi bật ạ. Em thấy bản thân đang khá phai mờ, tại vì có quá nhiều cơ hội trên đại học và em không biết nên đầu tư vào đâu. Em thấy mình khá vô dụng, đại học nhiều người giỏi lắm nhưng em không biết học đến đó bằng cách nào huhu. Em không muốn 4 năm tuổi thơ mình chỉ có học, xong chơi, làm mấy công việc kiếm tiền qua ngày rồi bị đá ra ngoài xã hội loay hoay nhìn bạn bè phát triển.

 I have posted here a year or so ago about the difficulties of getting my daughter her birth certificate here. My wife is Vietnamese, I am American, and we live in Vietnam which is where my daughter was born. The birth certificate issue was due to us giving her a western name and no one here telling us you cannot do that and instead just rejecting the birth certificate. So we got that resolved and gave our daughter a Vietnamese name and now have her birth certificate so the next step is getting a passport so I can take them to meet my family in America.
 It has been atleast 6 months and no passport. The reason being is when we renamed my daughter we gave her my family name which is a single syllable 3 letter name. Previously it was my father in law's name who is divorced from my…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[im a viet canadian and growing up my parents always spoke about chinese people using “they” and talked about them like they were super foreign and distanced from us. i get it because even though we have some cultural similarities like lunar new year we are still very different. however recently i found out that both of my parents each have a chinese grandparent who moved from south china to vietnam and assimilated long ago. there are no traces of chinese heritage within my family, no one has preserved the culture and language, it’s as if we are 0% chinese rather than 25% chinese. but honestly had i not inquired i never would have known. is this unusual for viets who are able to trace a chinese ancestor? do you consider yourselves viet-chinese or just viet? for my family i have always wondered why we don’t acknowledge it or consider ourselves chinese when there is a significant part of our heritage that is from china, but culturally we are 100% viet, the only chinese culture my parents have is going to eat dim sum lol. so i don’t really know if i can consider myself partially chinese when it was essentially erased. is it a common experience for any other viet people either in the diaspora or living in VN itself? if you had any chinese ancestors has your family retained any aspect of their culture now?

 Bản đồ đường UNCLOS 200 hải lý
 Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei,... đang đòi chia theo đường UNCLOS 200 hải lý. Nếu tòa quốc tế phán quyết đảo không phải của Trung Quốc nhưng của Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei,... thế thì khác nào từ mất đảo cho Trung Quốc đổi sang mất đảo cho 3 nước đó, chúng ta đâu có được cái gì?
 Hơn nữa, bây giờ thì Trung Quốc vẫn đang là bên vi phạm luật, Việt Nam vẫn còn mang tư cách nạn nhân bị lấn chiếm. Nếu đem ra kiện thì ngay lập tức 2 quần đảo sẽ không còn là của Việt Nam nữa, khi đó các hành động sử dụng khai thác 2 quần đảo của Việt Nam sẽ bị coi là lấn chiếm lãnh thổ của Brunei/Malaysia/Phillippines. Hiện tại 2 quần đảo hãy còn là vùng đang tranh chấp, chúng ta vẫn đang có 50 tiền đồn trên quần đảo Trường Sa, chẳng lẽ đi kiện để rồi mất trắng?
 Cho nên là đừng nghĩ quốc tế đang ủng hộ chúng ta. Trong cuộc chơi giữa các ông lớn với nhau thì chủ quyền của một nước nhỏ như Việt Nam chúng ta không là cái gì cả. Rất đau lòng nhưng cần phải chấp nhận sự thật như thế, chứ nếu ảo tưởng Hoàng Sa-Trường Sa vẫn đang thuộc về Việt Nam thì sẽ vĩnh viễn đứng nhìn cảnh kẻ khác làm giàu trên máu thịt của mình mà thôi.

I even got the whole thing recorded on my rear camera. But dude was raving about not having to pay anything as in Vietnamese culture, the car is always at fault regardless of how the accident happened.
 The motorcyclist is also demanding cash via text now in compensation to fix his motorcycle, phone, and laptop (I exchanged phone numbers with him for my insurance claims). Damage is minor and i don't plan on paying him a single cent. Just curious if this mentality is common.
 A Vietnamese friend of mine told me that its often true simply because car drivers are perceived to be more financially capable to bear the costs, even if they're not at fault. If this is true, that's pretty messed up. 
 Update: Motorcyclist is still trying to text and call me for cash. I suggested we settle this in the police station with my rear cam recording at hand. But he rejected. I'm starting to believe that this dude probably doesn't even have a license.

 I'm quite proud of my culture and celebrate it openly, and I'm also very lucky to have grown up in an area with strong Viet communities. As I went into high school, as a reaction to dismal education on the history of the Vietnam war, I did a lot of reading on my own and was pretty surprised by how different it was to my parent's accounts. 
 Of course I understood my parents went through unimaginable hardships during the war, I absolutely don't dismiss their personal experiences. I think it's common for Viet-American kids to be raised being told that HoChiMinh is an evil, genocidal man and that the communist party is the worst thing ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ll be traveling to Vietnam in two weeks. I’ll be in Saigon, Da Nang/Hoi An, and Hanoi (and the surrounding area perhaps). I am not on a backpacker budget but I figure for most of the trip there is still no reason to spend anymore than like 1,000,000 VND (30-40 USD) a night because the rooms are nice enough at that price. 
 But, this trip is somewhat of a celebration (just finished law school and took the bar) so at least once in the trip I would like to splurge, by Vietnamese standards, and get a really nice room. I guess like 3,500,000 VD (150 USD) a night. 
 I was thinking this would be best done in Da Nang because it’s on the beach and it’ll will be a pretty relaxing part of my trip. It didn’t seem necessary to spend too much in Saigon because I’ll be out and about all day and basically just sleeping at the hotel. 
 So, does this line of thinkingmake sense, and if so, can anyone recommend some more upscale places that you’ve had good experiences at? Would like a nice pool and bar area, good food, service, etc… 
 Open to this stuff in Saigon and Hanoi as well just like I said, doesn’t seem as worth it as Da Nang but open to being proved wrong. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am travelling to Vietnam with a friend as an adult for the first time, and I need all the advises I could get. I know that we need to get an evisa to enter the country, but if we are heading out in mid-October, when should I apply for the visa? Also, can I use the same visa to leave back to USA? We will be there in October, so what will the weather be like? What would you guys recommend to pack, buy/bring? What are some places you guys recommend for us to visit? We are open to everything, but super excited to do some shopping (clothes/skincare/makeup,) food places, entertainments, and spa/massage etc. We'll be staying in Saigon around Binh Thanh if it helps! Also, if there is any apps that would be useful for my travel, I would greatly appreciate it. FINALLY, please let me know what to avoid, and what are some well-known scams to look out to. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ll be going to Vietnam for the month of September with my boyfriend. This is not a hiking vacation, but we will do some touristy things I’m sure. He’s viet and I’m American, but he moved when he was a child and I can’t figure out what to wear and he’s not much help. Some people tell me just normal clothes, some tell me very modest attire. I know it’s hot and humid, so no way I’ll wear any jeans. Are tennis skirts ok? Should all dresses and skirts be ankle length? Is it offensive to see shoulders? I don’t want to offend anyone, but I also want to be comfortable.

 I'm curious, is there a high society movement? Do people use the term "high soc" here?Are vietnamese trying to differentiate themselves as high society from low society? In Thailand all you hear is high soc low soc everywhere especially with the rich parents of the students.

My family said Vietnam dislike China and I want to get perspective from those who are living in VN atm. I’ll be visiting Vietnam in September for the first time with my husband. He is Malaysian Chinese who is also born in Australia. He has an Australian passport but his surname is very chinese. Will he get targeted for bribes at the airport? $20 is not much for us but it’s the principle. My dad said that they don’t usually target younger people but I saw a few people here mentioning that they do. I can’t wait to visit my motherland but a bit nervous as I don’t know what to expect.

 mình thực sự không biết tác dụng của hoa hậu là gì.
 sắc đẹp là thứ từ khi được sinh ra đã nhận được, không cần qua rèn luyện thì có gì để thi thố và tự hào nhỉ. tự hào về thứ được ban cho ?, pttm tí cũng đẹp lên ngay ấy mà.
 nếu thi hoa hậu phải biết ứng xử thì thi mấy cuộc thi hùng biện cũng được mà nhỉ :v , thậm chí họ còn làm tốt hơn ấy chứ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thứ nhất: Mấy người vi phạm giao thông thì đã là người sai rồi. Mỗi năm có hàng triệu người chết vì tai nạn giao thông, mà đa phần là do những nguyên nhân hoàn toàn có thể phòng tránh được. Mấy người vi phạm thì tức là đang tăng rủi ro tai nạn lên cho bản thân và người khác, đến lúc tai nạn tàn phế ra thì ai cứu, chỉ còn biết than trời chứ làm thế nào được?
 Thứ hai: Csgt ăn đút lót thì chính mấy người vi phạm là người đút lót, csgt lỗi 10 thì mấy người cũng lỗi 7-8. Giả sử bạn vi phạm, bị vẫy lại, thay vì xin ghi biên bản, nộp bằng lái nộp phạt, thì lại chọn đút lót cho csgt hứa em không sai nữa, và rồi về chửi là csgt ăn hối lộ? Mà nếu các ông nghĩ mình không sai bị ăn tiền láo thì làm mẹ biên bản đi cho nó chuẩn chứ rén à mà hối lộ? Khó hiểu? Xong giả sử gặp ông csgt chuẩn, nhất quyết không nhận hối lộ thì lại lên mạng cào phím nhà nước phạt lắm tiền hút máu dân à?
 Tất nhiên tôi không cổ vũ cho hành động ăn hối lộ của csgt, hai cái sai thì không làm nên một cái đúng. Chỉ là nếu mọi người có ghét csgt thì hãy tìm lý do khác như kiểu gặp mấy thằng cảnh sát hách dịch, thái độ hà hiếp dân chẳng hạn, chứ tự người vi phạm đút lót để cho qua chuyện mà giờ lại chửi csgt ăn tiền thì nó vô lý.
 P/s: bình thường thì "thằng cảnh sát", "chó vàng", "pikachu" nhưng lúc ăn nhậu hay vặn quá tay ga bị vẫy thì chìa mấy trăm ra gọi "anh cảnh sát" ngọt xớt :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi my friends, would love to travel maybe even live in vietnam for a while but I might have a disease called celiac. it’s basically when even small amounts of gluten make you severely sick it is causing inflammation in your body and much more.
 I used to love vietnamese food here in germany but from my knowledge most of the dishes contain gluten at least here.
 Are there many dishes without gluten? is gluten free easily accessible on the country side? 
 It’s actually so severe that I have to be careful going to restaurant because if someone prepares a meal with gluten ona table and then prepares a gluten free meal on it that might be enough for me to react and get glutened.
 advice will be appreciated <3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to preface my rant - I'm Vietnamese. Living in western culture my whole life. Travelled extensively all around the world. I got enough of a perspective.
 I don't follow the sub closely, but lately I can't help but notice the posts where the OP is really dumbfounded that a totally different Asian culture with a heavy history has it's ways in day-to-day life and views?
 To me it looks like the certain disdain and irritation as in "Why you guys aren't like Bali, where the culture is all so westernized and easy for us to consume?"
 It seems so natural for me that when facing a different culture and especially in a developing country I am very respectful and accepting of the way they are. Instead of being on a high moral ground and in a position of a consumer, I try to get to know the people, the culture and be thankful that I'm being welcomed to their home.
 UPD. Since people get confused about what I'm trying to say. There are things that are deeply rooted in the culture of a nation. That's the "otherness" that people may or may not appreciate, but that's unique to every culture.
 There are problems that arise from socio-economical background and are pretty common in Asia and all around the developing countries. Those are things no Vietnamese is proud of but we are on the track of dealing with them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know it's a personal choice to eat how you want. And some foreigners also eat with the putrid sound of wet mushy food smacking back and forth while eating with their mouth open.
 But I find it to be much more common here in Vietnam. 
 To me, it's one of those sounds that rattle my insides. Similar to someone rubbing a balloon or scraping on a chalk board. 
 I'm sitting at a coffee shop now and a couple just sat next to me and they are both mouth smacking their food for the past 10 minutes or so. Even putting my earbuds in and putting the volume high. I can still hear it
 I know others also find this sound irritating. And it's obvious that people are able to eat without opening their mouths all the way 500 times during a meal and showing everyone the visuals and sounds of the first steps of the human digestion process
 I don't say anything. I'm not being a Karen. But it's absolutely disgusting. Why don't friends say anything to these people? Or literally nobody cares and it's enjoyable to eat a meal with these people as they make some of the most unappetizing noises? Why so common here in Vietnam? Like, the louder you eat your food, the richer you are? It brings you good luck or something? 
 Nasty noises from your mouth keep the ghosts away maybe? 👻

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! My partner and I have slowly started to look into potential baby names as we want to start a family soon. For reference, I am European Australian while my partner was born and raised in Vietnam. Any children we have will most likely grow up in Australia, though will frequently visit Vietnam to see family. We want to choose a first name that can easily be used in both Australia and Vietnam.
 We have been looking into Western first names that when shortened also sound like a Vietnamese name (this would be their nickname and also what they are called when in Vietnam). For example:
 (F) Maia (shortened to Mai) / (F) Maysie (shortened to May) / (M) Vincent (shortened to Vinh).
 Do you guys think this is too weird? 😅 Can you think of any other names like this?
 Otherwise, we were thinking of using a Vietnamese first name that is easy for English speakers to pronounce. Does anyone have any ideas?
 Opinions and advice would be great, thank you 😊
 Edit: We are mostly struggling with male names, though recommendations for female names would also be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probably we all know Vietnamese people get really uncomfortable with public displays of affection (kissing, hugging,…). I’m curious about how family members show love in their daily life. 
 I (30F) don’t remember the last time I gave my parents hugs or said “I love you” to them. I love them dearly, but it feels really awkward for me to say loving words or be affectionate toward them. 
 In our nuclear family, we give each other big hugs and say “I love you” every single day. My kids would get very upset if I forgot to do those things before rushing to work. 
 My parents at their 70s don’t sleep together anymore, and I never heard them say “I love you” to each other. I feel bad for them. I really wanna give my parents some support but there’s always an invisible wall between me and them that I find it so difficult to break. 
 I wonder if my situation is typical in Vietnamese culture or is it just my family background? My parents rarely say sweet words, always try to suppress their feelings and emotions (except for anger and frustrations 😑). They show their love by attentive care and share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I’ll be traveling to Ho Chi Minh City in September with my boyfriend and his family from the United States. 
 My boyfriend grew up there until he was about 8 years old then he moved here. He has a self admittedly very limited knowledge of the culture, things to see, norms etc. but he and his sister keep giving me the idea that I’ll hate it there and be very uncomfortable; the food will be shocking, pickpocketers, massive pests, domestic abuse, and lots of personal judgment of me based on how I react but they aren’t able to give me much specific advice of how to behave
 I don’t want to go into this 2 week long trip with a negative attitude, so what are some things to look forward to on my trip? I know it’s a beautiful place with lots to see but I just don’t know where to begin with all of these warnings about how bad it is
 Additionally, what are some cultural norms I should know about to make sure I don’t offend anyone, get lost or put in a bad situation when I don’t know the language?
